      <field name="heading_text">John Payne Collier's Great Forgery by Giles E. Dawson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A communication in The Athenaeum for 31 January 1852, signed "J. Payne Collier," announced his purchase of a copy of the Second Folio of Shakespeare inscribed "Tho. Perkins, his Booke" and containing thousands of alterations of the text written in a hand "probably not of later date than the Protectorate." This "Perkins Folio," now in the Huntington Library, does indeed contain thousands of alterations — perhaps 25,000 — ranging in size from marks of punctuation to whole lines and pairs of lines. In 1859 Sir Frederic Madden, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, observed that the writing in the book was "not a genuine writing, either of the 17th or 18th century." Later evidence found at the Museum indicated that Collier himself had been the fabricator, and Clement Mansfield Ingleby, in A Complete View of the Shakspere Controversy , 1861, set forth all the evidence of Collier's wrongdoing. But, persuasive though the evidence is in its sheer bulk, most of it is at best circumstantial, and the rest is open to suspicion. Madden, though a first-class paleographer, did not record in any detail his reasons for concluding that the Perkins annotations were written in the nineteenth century. Nor, until now, has anyone else made a thorough paleographical examination of them. A good many years ago I was struck by the close similarity between the writing of the corrections in the Perkins folio and that of eighty-three ballads written in a manuscript in the Folger Library. But though I then saw good reason for believing that Collier had written the ballads, it was not until I tackled the problem recently that I came upon the proof that at first eluded me. That proof, together with a demonstration that the ballads and the Perkins annotations are the products of one hand, is the matter of this paper. By way of introduction I might reasonably be expected to provide an account of Collier's career, emphasizing the facts concerning his acquisition of the Second Folio, Collier's several descriptions of the written matter in it, his later dealings with these, the first suspicions about their genuineness, and the evidence of fabrication that was produced within ten years of Collier's first announcement. But since all this is readily available in Sir George Warner's admirable account in The Dictionary of National Biography and all the details may be read in Ingleby's Complete View , I may perhaps be excused for skipping the background matter in the interests of brevity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I My first task, then, is to demonstrate that eighty-three ballads written in a manuscript volume in the Folger Library (V.a.339) are the work of J. P. Collier. The manuscript is a commonplace book of 291 leaves measuring 5.3 x 3.6 inches, originally bound in reddish-brown calf in the early seventeenth century and rebound, in 1960, in the Folger bindery. At that time, while the book was in sheets, I collated it and pencilled a signature on the first recto of each sheet. The collation, by these added signatures, is as follows: A 8 (—A1,5) B-L 8 M 8 (—M6) N-Z 8 2A 8 (—2A8) 2B 8 (—2B1) 2C-2D 8 2E 8 (—2E4,5,6) 2F-2O 8 2P 4 (—2P4). The book originally consisted of 300 leaves, of which nine have been removed. There is no indication that any of these extractions are attributable to Collier. While the book was in his possession he numbered the leaves, but made mistakes that resulted in his ending with 282 instead of 291. I later added correct foliation, which can be seen in the reproduction of f. 114 in Plate I, my numbers being smaller in size but greater numerically than Collier's. Of the date at which Collier acquired the manuscript volume all that can be said with certainty is that it was in his possession in 1843, when, in his first edition of Shakespeare (8 vols. 1842-44), VIII (1843), 568, he notices a variant in a piece from the Passionate Pilgrim copied into the manuscript by its first owner, to the end of which have been added the initials W. S. in a hand and ink that, like initials elsewhere in the volume, I believe to be Collier's. Collier's statements about the date are vague and inconsistent; that he bought the manuscript from Thomas Thorpe, as he several times says, we need not question. After his death in 1883 the volume was No. 16 in the catalogue of the sale of his library by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge, 7-9 August 1884. The successful bidder, Quaritch, paid £52. In another Sotheby sale, 20-22 April 1899, the manuscript was No. 1002 in a section of "Other Properties." A statement in the catalogue of this sale informs us that "In a note on a fly-leaf he [Collier] says "This volume, besides other poems, contains about 80 ballads not found elsewhere. I gave Thorpe £25 for it.'" No such fly-leaf was present when the manuscript came to the Folger Library; we may assume that it was the missing A1. In the same year the manuscript appeared as No. 386 in J. Pearson's Catalogue of Shakespeareana , 2 volumes, 1899, and was sold to Marsden J. Parry, of Providence, Rhode Island, after whose death it passed, through A. S. W. Rosenbach's hands, to H. C. Folger. Who the first owner and first user of the volume was seems impossible to determine. It may have been the Joseph Hall (not the Bishop of Norwich) whose signature is on what is now the only fly-leaf, A2, but this is doubtful, since the appearance of the signature does not suggest that Hall wrote anything else in the book and does suggest that it was written as late perhaps as 1700. All but two of the 582 pages are pretty well filled with written matter. The first writer appears, from a few scattered dates, to have done his work in the decade from 1630 to 1640. He did about fifty percent of all the writing (by page-count; it would be more by word-count because his writing is always small, sometimes minute, always close packed). Starting with a blank book, he planned to classify his matter, allotting a section of the book to each kind — theology and religion, medicine, remedies, and so on — six sections in all. He began each section at the top of a page and from time to time made additions, leaving no space between old and new matter. None of the five sections of written matter fills the block of pages allotted, so that he left blocks of blank leaves, the biggest containing 142 pages. The second man who used the book did his writing (on about forty percent of the pages) during the next decade — if we can judge by the dates scattered through his portion of the writing, the latest of which is 1648. At first he seems to have continued his predecessor's classification but to have given it up when certain of the available spaces became filled. But he always started just where the first left off, not unusually at the top of a page. When the second writer quit, ff. 39 v -41, 107 v -179, 181 v , 228 v , 242-245, 276 v -277 were entirely blank, while the lower halves of ff. 39, 181, and 227 were also unused and empty. All of these pages except the last two, still blank, now contain the eighty-three ballads written, as I think I can show, by Collier in a simulated hand of the seventeenth century. Below is a list of the ballads. The first column consists of Collier's serial numbers (some counted but not written by Collier and now silently supplied). The second gives the number of the leaf on which each ballad begins. The third is titles. The fourth gives the first three or four words of each ballad. The fifth consists of Collier's notes, with some bracketed additions, corrections, or substitutions. Most of Collier's notes consist of page numbers or volume-and-page numbers, which I will explain shortly. Nine of the notes identify or lead to printed sources from which Collier took certain ballads; these too I will enlarge on presently. Those on Nos. 54 and 77, like the query on No. 75, are typical specimens of his puckish mystification and verisimilitude; Collier knew perfectly well whence he had copied the ballads. The note on No. 1 reads "See Massinger 'Believe as you List' pr. by Percy Society p. 65," where the words "a new rigg'd pinnace" are used, as the same figure is in the ballad, of a courtesan. The dates supplied for Nos. 62, 63, 64, 73, and 74 are dates of events or subject matter. The note on No. 59 is baffling. All of these notes, Collier's serial numbers, and of course the foliation, are in pencil, in Collier's normal nineteenth-century hand. One note shown in the list, connected with No. 76, is an exception, for it is in ink and in the simulated old hand — another bit of mystification, though the possibility that there is or was another book is not to be ruled out. 1. 107 v The Pinnace A pinnace riggd [see above] 2. 108 To his Lady O pity me 3. 109 *Giue Place You Ladies Giue place you p. 152 p. 170 4. 110 *Kitt hath lost her Key Kit hath loste p. 55 5. 110 v *Youth and Age Olde age and Youth p. 83 6. 111 v *Women best when at Reste Women are best p. 23 7. 112 *The Praise of Milkemaydes Passe not for p. 90 8. 113 *All in a garden Greene All in a garden p. 196 9. 114 Dames of London Who so defames 10. 115 *Ladie Ianes Lament Now must I lose p. 72 11. 115 v *The Cuckoes Song ffull merilie singes p. 122 12. 116 v *The Kinges hunt is vpp The hunt is vp p. 129 13. 117 *The Batchelour Hough for a p. 43 14. 118 v Agaynst Idelness Though idlenes in See Shak.

John Heywood's Works and Miscellaneous Short Poems , ed. B. A. Milligan, Univ. of Illinois Press, 1956, p. 256; also in J. O. Halliwell [-Phillipps], ed., The Moral Play of Wit and Science, and Early Poetical Miscellanies . From an unpublished manuscript, B. M. Addit. MS. 15,233, Shakespeare Soc., 1848, p. 79. The poem as printed in these two editions consists of a burden and six stanzas, of which Collier's version includes four, with many alterations. He probably used Halliwell-Phillipps' collection, as his marginal note suggests. 20. A Handful of Pleasant Delights (1584), STC 21105, ed. H. E. Rollins, 1924, p. 12. Collier's text shows substantive alteration, including additions and omissions. 24. The Moral Play of Wit and Science (as in 14, above), p. 89. Halliwell-Phillipps' version consists of a burden and twenty stanzas, Collier's, of eleven stanzas, some owing little to the original, others more or less altered. Of the thirty-four ballads printed in the notes in the Extracts this is the only one for which I have found a printed source. 27. Tottel's Miscellany (1557), STC 13860, ed. J. P. Collier, Illustrations of Early English Poetry , I (1886-70), 18; also ed. Rollins, 1965, I, 14. Collier makes a few alterations. 28. A Paradise of Dainty Devices (1576), STC 7516, ed. Collier, Illustrations of Early English Poetry , I (1866-70), 13; also ed. Rollins, 1927, p. 9. There is a fair amount of Collier's usual tampering with the text. 31. Collier presumably took this from the broadside in the Roxburghe collection of ballads acquired by the British Museum in 1845 from the estate of B. H. Bright, who acquired them in 1813. The ballad was later printed in the Roxburghe Ballads , I (ed. W. Chappell, 1888), 629. In Collier's version almost every line is lengthened by the addition of an extra foot or syllable (a liberty characteristic of Collier), in an attempt at improvement. 41. B. Googe, Eglogs, Epytaphes, and Sonnettes (1563), STC 12048, ed. E. Arber, English Reprints, 1871, p. 105; also ed. F. B. Fieler, Scholars Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1968. Collier's version contains several verbal alterations by way of improvement. 54. James Yates, The Castell of Courtesie (1582), STC 26079, sig. L3. Collier's text is essentially that of the original, but with many verbal alterations little affecting the sense, some of them improving the metre, and all looking like Collier's work. 77. G. Gascoigne, A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres (1587), STC 11638, ed. C. T. Prouty, University of Missouri Press, 1942, p. 150. Four other pieces that he drew from printed sources Collier does not identify. These are as follows: 33. A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions (1578), STC 20402, ed. Collier, Illustrations , III, 124; also ed. Rollins, 1926, p. 100. Collier's text agrees fairly closely with Rollins'. 40. Collier must have taken this either from the broadside in the Roxburghe collection (see No. 31 in the foregoing list) or from that he himself had recently published, A Book of Roxburghe Ballads , 1847. Collier's manuscript consists of only eleven stanzas and differs in other repects from his own printed version with fifteen stanzas. That this latter followed the original broadside closely (except in omitting one stanza) is shown by its (for Collier) surprising textual agreement with the sixteen-stanza version printed in the Roxburghe Ballads , VI (ed. Ebsworth, 1888), 277. 72. A Gorgeous Gallery , ed. Rollins, p. 24. Collier's text follows the original fairly closely except for the interpolation of an erotic stanza. 75. A Paradise of Dainty Devises , ed. Rollins, p. 59. A stanza probably of Collier's composition is substituted for one that appears in all early editions and in Rollins'. The many page references that Collier pencilled in his book in connection with the eighty-three ballads (shown above in the complete list) are references to a work of Collier's own, Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers Company . . . 1557-1570 and, Vol. II, 1570-1587 , Shakespeare Soc., 1848, 1849 (hereafter abbreviated as Extracts ). Collier's selection of entries from the Register for printing in this work is in keeping with his life-long concentration upon the popular literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The entries are of ballads and other light verse, plays, tales, romances, and the like. For about half of his entries he furnishes notes that exhibit his quite impressive familiarity with the material. They supply bibliographical data, gloss words, discuss subject matter, suggest alternative readings, and occasionally assert that a ballad has not survived in print. It is with these notes that we are mainly concerned. Thirty-three of them, mostly notes to ballad entries, say that the piece entered in the Register is not known to exist, or does not exist, and add a reference to a manuscript volume in the editor's possession that contains the ballad in question. Then follows the ballad printed in full. The note that includes ballad No. 12 also prints one stanza of No. 17. Thus in thirty-three notes thirty-four of the ballads from Collier's old manuscript volume (which is of course Folger MS. V.a.339) are printed fully or in part. Henceforth I refer to these as "the thirty-four ballads." They are the ballads marked with asterisks in the list on pages 8-10, above. Strictly speaking, they are not all ballads in any proper sense, but Collier always so calls them, and no confusion will result from my using the term for the sake of brevity. My primary interest is not in the ballads themselves, but in the way they came to be written in the old commonplace book. The evidence will show that before "finding" the thirty-four ballads and identifying them in the Stationers' Register, Collier himself wrote them — them and the rest of the eighty-three. Here we may pause to consider what Collier asks us to believe. In his preface to the Extracts (I, p. vii) he writes as follows: Among the illustrations, following the entries, will be observed not a few ballads, which have never been re-published in modern times, which, no doubt, once existed in print, but which have been lost, and are now only known from transcripts. Most of these have been derived from the Editor's own sources, particularly from a volume belonging to him in a handwriting of the time of James I. If Collier's date were correct — if the ballads had been written in the commonplace book in the reign of James I — we would find nothing odd in the fact that twelve of the ballads that are on datable historical subjects (Nos. 32, 47, 57, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 73, 74, 78, 81) are all Elizabethan and we would scarcely notice the fact that the early poetical collections in which ten of the ballads had been printed were all published before 1588. That the entries in the Stationers' Register that correspond with thirty-four of the ballads were all made before 1588 we might think a curious coincidence but would not regard as utterly incredible. But we know that the second of two early writers in the commonplace book was still at work in 1648 and that the ballads were written after he had stopped. While Collier was working on his second volume he must have come upon the evidence of a date much later than the time of James I. Several of the notes in Volume I refer to that time as the date of his manuscript volume, but notes near the end of Volume II give the date as "about the middle of the seventeenth century" (p. 200) and "about the reign of Charles I" (p. 215), and the new preface makes a perfunctory correction of his earlier assumption. That Collier ever saw the implications of this later date there is no reason to believe. The implications are severely damaging of his whole case regarding the ballads. He would have us believe that a ballad collector of 1650 gathered eighty-three ballads, of which thirty-four (forty percent) had been printed, or at least entered, between 1570 and 1587 (just the period of Collier's Extracts ) and none that were later, 1 twelve on historical events of the reign of Elizabeth (none later), and ten that had been printed in collections before 1588 (none later). One of the most curious features of the ballads is their relationship to the Stationers' Register, and these go deeper than we have yet seen. Further examination of the thirty-four ballads (those printed in notes to the Extracts ) reveals another kind of relationship, which is made clear in the two tables that follow: Table I Ballad number Where printed Date of entry 3 I.152 1566-7 4 I.55 1561-2 5 I.83 1563-4 6 I.23 1558-9 7 I.90 1563-4 8 I.196 1568-9 10 I.72 1562-3 11 I.122 1565-6 12 I.129 1565-6 13 I.43 1561-2 15 I.5 1557-8 17 I.130 1565-6 18 I.9 1557-8 21 I.117 1565-6 22 I.104 1564-5 23 I.145 1565-6 24 I.186 1568-9 Ballad number Where printed Date of entry 29 I.33 1560-1 32 I.40 1560-1 34 II.69 1570-1 36 II.6 1570-1 38 I.132 1565-6 39 I.213 1569-70 44 II.62 1578 50 II.97 1579-80 53 I.162 1566-7 59 II.189 1584-5 63 II.35 1576-7 65 II.216 1586-7 66 II.200 1585-6 69 II.30 1576-7 71 II.43 1577 73 II.125 1580-1 74 II.111 1579-80 Table II Where printed Balled number I.5 15 I.9 18 I.23 6 I.33 29 I.40 32 I.43 13 I.55 4 I.72 10 I.83 5 I.90 7 I.104 22 I.117 21 I.122 11 I.129 12 I.130 17 I.132 38 I.145 23 Where printed Balled number I.152 3 I.162 53 I.186 24 I.196 8 I.213 39 II.6 36 II.30 69 II.35 63 II.43 71 II.62 44 II.69 34 II.97 50 II.111 74 II.125 73 II.189 59 II.200 66 II.216 65 What can be seen at a glance, in Table I, is this: that of the first twenty-four ballads written in the manuscript (Nos. 1-24) Collier was to "find" that seventeen corresponded with ballad titles entered in the Stationers' Register before 1570 and that the last eight corresponded with titles entered after 1575. Thus there is a roughly chronological order in the thirty-four ballads as they stand in the manuscript. In the ballad-number column of Table II I find five pairs of numbers that are consecutive in Table I: 29 and 32, 22 and 21, 11 and 12, 74 and 73, 66 and 65. Among thirty-four ballads this kind of correspondence among ten does not look like pure chance. If we are to believe in Collier's sevententh-century ballad collector we must be able to put forward a reasonable hypothesis to account for the unmistakable traces of chronological arrangement in thirty-four of the ballads as they stand in his manuscript. The assumption that he copied these from printed broadsides does not help, since the printers of ballads, fully conscious of their ephemeral nature, almost never dated their imprints. Our supposed collector would have had to be a tireless researcher to achieve even such a degree of chronological arrangement as we find. Yet with the twelve ballads about easily-dated events — Lady Jane Grey's lament, the burning of St. Paul's steeple, the great earthquake, and the others — he took no trouble to set them down in any order. I can make no sense out of this. But if instead we assume that Collier himself wrote the ballads in the commonplace book we can reach a reasonable explanation of all the main features of the collection. Looking into the Stationer's Register and finding it rich in entries of popular literature, he began, in 1847, transcribing all the entries that interested him, with a view to publication. At some point during the work of editing it occurred to him that he might compose pseudo-Elizabethan ballads to fit the titles that struck his fancy as he came across them and that he could then "find" them and print them in his notes. We cannot know whether or not he wrote the ballads in the order in which he found appropriate titles. It was obviously not in this order that he copied them into his commonplace book. The first ballad listed in Table I, above, is the eighteenth in Table II, and the sixth in Table I is the twenty-first in Table II. Presumably Collier first wrote the ballads in his ordinary hand on ordinary sheets of paper; at what stage in his work he copied them into the book appears to be inscrutable and irrelevant. When he prepared for the task of copying in his "old" hand, though he did not sufficiently appreciate the problems of avoiding detection, he realized that the thirty-four ballads must not stand in the manuscript in the fully chronological order in which they would appear in the printed Extracts . It was clear to him also that his manuscript collection must not consist solely of the thirty-four ballads entered in the Stationers' Register between 1557 and 1587. There must be others with them, and these he could of course manufacture as easily as he did most of the thirty-four. It is reasonable to suppose that he had long entertained himself by writing Elizabethan ballads and that he had some of these laid away, and he could write more as they were needed. Accordingly he selected a few suitable pieces, perhaps wrote some new ones, and, for verisimilitude, gathered a dozen or so from Elizabethan printed sources. These he interpolated among the sheets containing the thirty-four and shuffled them all together. The shuffling was adequate (as Table I shows) — or nearly so — but the interpolating was remarkably uneven, as can be seen in a list in which the thirty-four are in roman type, the interpolations in italic: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 The uneven interpolation, light at the beginning, heavy in the middle and at the end, does not look like chance. Two alternative and almost equally attractive explanations present themselves: (1) Collier was unable, till he had copied about twenty-four, to estimate how many ballads the available pages would take; (2) it may have been only after he had copied twenty-four of the ballads that he observed that the interpolation was too light and must be increased. Neither explanation accounts for the presence of the last nine superfluous ballads; perhaps he merely wanted to fill up the space. Since the whole eighty-three are included in a list that Collier prints in the preface to Extracts , II (1849), we cannot suppose any to be later additions. I have been assuming that all but one of the ballads printed in the Extracts and most of the others were of his own composition. He may have drawn from printed sources more than the thirteen identified above, but I doubt that many more will prove to be of this sort. The existence of some seventy ballads apparently unique among the eighty-three argues not only against an early collector but for Collier's authorship. Further evidence, tenuous though it is, supports this assumption. In his notes, where he is vague as always in speaking of his old manuscript, Collier frequently notes that a ballad is not known to have survived in print or that he has not heard of a copy. But four times he is positive: No. 5 "has been preserved in MS. only ( penes the Editor)," and Nos. 11, 21, and 34 are known only in manuscript. These lapses, as they must be, into expressions of the positive knowledge that only the author could have had seem to reveal more than he intended. More telling perhaps, when we take Collier's evident vanity into account, is his praise of certain ballads — praise not warranted by any special excellence that I can recognize. No. 3 "runs thus pleasantly, and by no means unpoetically." No. 11 is a "remarkable and spirited ballad," No. 12 "an extremely spritely performance." No. 15 "has considerable merit" and "must have been written by no inferior hand." About No. 21 "There is something very striking in the manner and measure," and No. 71 is "a remarkable and striking relic of the time." Collier's vanity is well illustrated in a letter to J. W. Ebsworth, 12 August 1879 (an uncatalogued Folger manuscript), where he writes of his Poet's Pilgrimage (1825), a poem in four dull cantos, "I thought, &amp; think, that I never wrote anything else that was half as good — yet nobody cares a fig about it, but its poor old Author. . . . It is good: it is of its kind, highly meritorious and imaginative. It is good, let who will say the contrary, and by it I will live &amp; die." His sensitiveness as a result of the neglect of that poem was such that he never again, I believe, publicly exposed an acknowledged poem of his own. Perhaps that is all the explanation we need for Collier's cryptoauthorship of the ballads published in the Extracts , there exposed in the hope that they would be praised by others. That Collier could and did write ballads meant to be approximately Elizabethan in character is proved by several among the many specimens of his own verse scattered through his privately-printed Old Man's Diary (2 volumes, 1871-72). In another letter to Ebsworth, 27 October 1879, he writes, "ballad writing is merry work, if good, both for writer and reader." I do not wish to press the evidence of Collier's authorship of most of the eighty-three ballads, though it helps to explain the uniqueness of seventy of them. The point is not essential to my purpose. If it was in hope of praise that Collier printed his ballads in the Extracts he was not altogether disappointed, for William Chappell thought highly enough of seven of them (Nos. 7, 8, 12, 17, 18, 32, 57) to print them in his Popular Music of the Olden Time (2 vols., London, 1859), with references to the Extracts or to Collier's old manuscript, which Chappell could have known only from the Extracts . Collier also lived to see No. 10, "Lady Jane's Lament," printed by Furnivall in Ballads from Manuscripts (1868-72), the first volume of the Ballad Society's publications. Norman Ault thought three of the ballads (Nos. 18, 36, 39) worthy of inclusion in Elizabethan Lyrics (1949 ed.), pp. 37, 514, 61.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Whether Collier composed the ballads or not we can be quite sure that it was he who copied them into his old commonplace book. If, then, it can be demonstrated that the annotations in the Perkins folio are in the handwriting of those ballads, Collier's fabrication of these will have been proved. That demonstration is my next task. It ought not to be a difficult one, for, given two such ample specimens to work with, it will always be possible and usually easy to determine whether they are the work of one hand or two. Each half century or so has its own characteristic handwriting, the norm being the work of the writing masters, the schoolteachers, and the copybooks. But every schoolboy sooner or later, depending upon how much writing he does, departs from the prescribed norm — adopting his own comfortable slant, his own penlifts and linkages, his own ways of forming certain letters. Thus by the time he reaches maturity he possesses his own peculiar hand, as much his own as his fingerprints. A close analysis of the writing of two persons will therefore bring to light many fairly consistent differences even though the two specimens bear a strong superficial resemblance. Without such a resemblance the question will hardly arise. This is true of today's hands and of the hands of any century. It is more strikingly true of the secretary hand of the sixteenth century than of later English hands. Two men's secretary's hands are easier to distinguish than two later hands because many letters of the secretary alphabet are more complicated than those of later alphabets. This complexity provided greater scope for individuality, and men took advantage of this, for they set store by individuality in writing. A father admonishing a son at Oxford in 1622 charged him with a "barren invention" in his writing, for the son's hand lacked character and individuality — qualities that the father's possessed in abundance. The two specimens that I am to examine are secretary only in part. They are of a style of writing common in the seventeenth century, for which the term mixed hand seems appropriate because of the mixture in it of secretary letters and italic. The secretary hand was a native English hand that for the greater part of the sixteenth century was most widely in use for literary composition, letter-writing, and business. Since it developed from earlier hands its beginnings cannot be dated, but we find it fully developed by 1525. For the next hundred years it remained the common hand, taught to schoolboys and written by most men. But it was not the only hand of the sixteenth century in England. Before the beginning of the century the italic hand — a new hand in Italy that grew out of the humanistic script — was brought to England. It was in the sixteenth century a rather special hand regarded as more beautiful than the secretary, but at first used mainly at the universities, later adopted by many noblemen. Well before the end of the century we find other men using it as a second hand; Ben Jonson was one who did, a little later. The increasing popularity of the italic hand near the end of the sixteenth century and in the seventeenth was, by 1700, to drive the secretary out and take its place as the common hand. The process by which this conquest took place is not clearly understood. Some schoolteachers may have been teaching it, but I suspect that it was the growing use of the italic as a second hand that gave rise to the mixed hands — half secretary, half italic — that are observable by 1625 and very common before 1650. For some letters, c and e , for example, there appears about the middle of the century to be a strong preference for the secretary in mixed hands; in several other letters the preference, more or less strong, was for the italic. Some letters can hardly be called secretary or italic because identical forms are used in both. Other considerations too limit the letters that we can profitably use in examining mixed hands to six minuscules and four capitals. In the table below, using these letters (with two kinds of s ) I show the mixtures used by ten seventeenth-century writers and by Collier in the hand of the ballads. Columns 1 and 2 represent the two early writers in Collier's manuscript volume, columns 3 through 10, eight hands written between 1629 and 1665 drawn from a collection of the correspondence of Col. Robert Bennet (Folger MS. X.d.483 (1-209)). Column 11 represents Collier's hand. S stands for secretary, I for italic, SI for letters that are mixed by a single writer — now secretary, now italic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 e S S S SI SI S S S S S S f I SI SI I I I I I I I I g I S S SI S S S I I I I h SI SI I SI I I I SI I SI S p SI S I S S SI S S S S S init.-med. s I SI S SI I I I I I I I final s I I S SI SI SI I S I I S E I I I I SI I I I I I S G S S S I I I S I I I I H I S S S I I I SI S I S T SI SI S SI I S I SI S I S Of the ten genuine hands represented here no two exhibit the same mixture. If we omit f and E because each shows a tendency to be of one kind or the other and ignore some other probable but imponderable tendencies, it will appear that the chance of finding the same mixture in two different hands of the midseventeenth century is one in 6,561. Collier's ballad hand, column 11, shows, of course, a unique mixture. The hand of the Perkins annotations shows the same mixture, with the exception of one letter which I will explain and which does not reduce the significance of the similarity. It is, however, the individual letters that must carry the burden of proof. In working with the minuscules we must look for letter-shapes or other characteristics that are eccentric, unusual, highly individual in the period under consideration — the seventeenth century because the hand purports to be of that century. If we find frequently recurring in one specimen a certain letter formed in a curious and uncommon way and then find the same curious form in the other specimen, again recurring frequently, this will suggest a single writer. If we find half a dozen such letters a single writer is strongly indicated. In what follows I attempt to demonstrate that certain letter-shapes common in Collier's ballads do not conform to standard or common practice of the midseventeenth century. To make this demonstration I refer to Plate IV, where I reproduce many examples of three minuscles and one capital letter found in the Bennet correspondence described above. In gathering these examples I took the characteristic shape or shapes of each of four letters as I found them in each of a large number of documents written by different hands. Written above each letter is the number of the document from which I took it. Several of the shapes reproduced are unique among those shown; had I gathered other letters too, I should have found more unique shapes, possibly some of them at least roughly identical with shapes common in Collier's ballads. I cannot assert that any letter-shape in the ballads is unique. What the reproductions in Plate IV do show, I think, is what we may regard as the common, usual shapes that we might expect to find in most mixed hands of the midseventeenth century. These reproductions, as I have taken the liberty of calling them, are not facsimiles, but the best copies that I could make by hand. Each of my reproductions fairly represents the proportions and shapes of the letters; a photograph would prove no more than these prove. For the letters that I discuss but do not reproduce in Plate IV I made a careful search through the Bennet letters to assure myself that the shapes that I discuss in the ballads are not (unless I so designate them) generally standard or common shapes. Below I examine in detail three minuscules and three capital letters that are to be found both in the ballads and in the Perkins annotations. f This minuscule differs from the tall s of the ballads (hereafter abbreviated Bal. ) and the annotations (hereafter Ann. ) in having, usually, instead of the straight shank of the s (as in staring , Plate II, f. 114 v , line 4), a bowed or hooked descender ( finde , faire , Plate I, f. 114, lines 16, 17), in having, often, a looped head ( first , Plate I, f. 113 v , line 6), and in being crossed just above the baseline. The cross is what makes it an f , not an s . About this letter, as found in Bal. and Ann. , there is nothing distinctive or interesting. It becomes so only when followed by and joined to a t , for here Collier almost, but not quite, always forms an s instead of an f ; that is he does not cross the shank. An example may be seen in often , Plate II, f. 114 v , line 14. Elsewhere I have found ten more of these in Bal. and four in Ann. — three of the four shown in Plate III: oft in (b), line 1; after in (d), line 2; left in (g), line 1. Three times (to fifteen) I have found ft properly made — one of them shown in Plate II, f. 114 v , line 13 ( soften ). I attach considerable weight to the appearance in both Bal. and Ann. of this curious abberration. g Collier's typical g , an italic, may be seen in all of the reproduced pages of Bal . Those in staring and louing (Plate II, f. 114 v , lines 4 and 15) are typical. The common italic g of the seventeenth century is essentially the same as the g of today. The secretary g is distinguished by being open at the top, like our y , then crossed by a separate stroke that usually forms the link with the following letter. Several of the examples shown in Plate IV are secretary letters that the writer forgot to cross. Of the italic forms there shown none resembles the characteristic Bal. g with its hooked descender, which we must conclude is not a usual or standard form of about 1650. The same g is to be found abundantly in Ann. and may be seen in Plate III (c), line 1, in the words grace and high . A variant to be discussed later can be seen in brings , in Plate III (e) and in other words in (f) and (g). h The secretary h of Bal. is a perfect copybook shape, almost identical, at its best and most typical, with the shape shown in the secretary alphabet in De Beau Chesne and Baildon, A Booke Containing Divers Sortes of Hands (1571). But in practice few writers of any time formed the letter in that way; most men made the loop lower and rounder, like the secretary specimens numbered 2, 5, and 15 in Plate IV, which are typical Elizabethan shapes. The examples in that plate indicate that the Bal. h is not the usual one in the midseventeenth century. The common shape of h in Bal. may be seen in might in Plate I, f. 113 v , line 1. It can also be seen in thankes and thanke in III (b) and (c), respectively, and it is the usual h in Ann . s The secretary hand makes a distinction between the s used initially or medially and the final s ; they are two quite different characters. That Collier makes this distinction may be seen in Plate I, f. 113 v , line 3, shines . Only the initial-medial s now concernes us. This can be seen in virtually every line in Plates I and II and in Plate III (b), (c), (f), and (h). That it is not a standard or usual form is evident in Plate IV, where Nos. 3, 6, 7, 10, 31, and others are secretary. The Bal. s , also found everywhere in Ann. is not really either secretary or italic; in fact I do not remember that I have elsewhere seen such an s . So highly eccentric and abnormal is this letter that it is hard to see how Collier came to adopt it. Before beginning the examination of individual capitals I must make one or two observations about capital letters in general. Most of these had in the sixteenth century, as they have now, more than one acceptable, almost standard, shape, and many writers used interchangeably two or more shapes for certain capitals. Again, in the sixteenth century and now a plain roman block capital, resembling roman type, may be used for almost any letter. Many sixteenth-century writers commonly used both a standard secretary C and a roman block capital, either plain or embellished, and so with other letters as well. Plain block capitals are almost worthless for the kind of investigation I am attempting, but a number of secretary capitals and some italic are useful. F Collier's ordinary form of this capital, a secretary form, has little individuality and is not useful. The F that concerns us is an italic letter. In Plates I and II, on ff. 114 and 176 v , two titles of ballads are written in pure italic. From the sixteenth century onward it was a common practice in secretary writing to use italics for titles, for Latin words, and for such other purposes as printers used italic type for. Following this custom, Collier's ballad titles are almost all in italics, though with some scattered mixture, presumably unintentional, of secretary letters. Likewise in the Perkins annotations stage-directions and speakers' names are by and large italic, and here I find three examples (Comedies p. 274, Histories pp. 56 and 79 [2H4]) of an eccentric and therefore useful F . The peculiarity of this F (not shown in Plate III) is that the lower, short bar is not horizontal but a mere dot elongated vertically. No such F is to be found in the ballads, but an E of exactly the same sort can be seen in Plate II, f. 176 v , in Earthquake , and another example of the E is on f. 154 (not illustrated). G Typical examples of the italic Bal. G are to be seen in Plate II, f. 176 v , lines 5 and 9-up. Of the twenty-eight examples of this letter shown in Plate IV, most are, like the Bal. G , italic, but only No. 31 is of the same type. The same G as that common in Bal. occurs throughout Ann. and may be seen in Plate III (a). H This capital, shown in Plate I, f. 113 v , line 5, occurs throughout both Bal. and Ann. with little variation. Though a perfectly acceptable secretary letter, its shape is not a common one at any time. Of eighteen examples of H that I found in the Bennet collection only three were secretary, and none bore close resemblance to Collier's. Several capital letters must be approached in a different way, since what is interesting about them is not any striking eccentricity of form, but the variety of forms in which they appear. This could be shown to hold true in both Bal. and Ann. of the letters B , C , D , L , M , N , P , R , S , and W . A single one of these letters will perhaps be sufficient to show how any or all of them would confirm the evidence that I have already produced. Though the N exhibits fewer varieties than either M or W it will, through the exigencies of the Bal. reproductions, serve well. I find five major types of N , all of which can be seen in Plates I and II. They are as follows: (1) a type common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and the commonest of the five in Bal. — Plate II, f. 176 v , line 3-up; (2) almost as common as the first, in Bal. — Plate II, f. 114 v , line 9-up; (3) Plate I, f. 113 v , line 1; (4) Plate I, f. 113 v , line 8-up, and f. 114, line 4-up; (5) the only secretary form of the letter in Bal. and one of only two examples there — Plate I, f. 114, line 13-up, a form that I have not found in the seventeenth century. All of these forms of N occur in Ann. , including (5), which I have found there only once. Similarly all the types of M and W that I have seen in Bal . I have found also in Ann. , together with at least one additional type of each and several variants not found in Bal . In discussing the minuscule g above I pointed out one of several examples of a g not found in Bal . In Ann. this variant occurs about as frequently as does the Bal. g . The only other minuscule of which I have observed a new variety peculiar to Ann. is the w. The Bal. w may be seen in Plate I, f. 113 v , lines 2, 5, 6, and 7; it may also be seen in Ann. in Plate III (a), with , (c), w th out , and (g) way . The new Ann. variety is shown in III (b), w th , (c), which , and (e), what . Like the g , the old Bal. w and the new variant appear to be evenly mixed in Ann . Of the capital letters that we have examined, F , G , and H , no significant variants are to be found in Ann. (always excepting wholly italic stage-directions and speakers' names). But I find in Ann. three other capital letters, A, E , and I , that are either unknown in Bal. or almost unknown. Of the A the Bal. type (of which some half dozen are to be seen in Plate I, f. 114) is common in Ann as well (Plate III (b)). But there is a new Ann. type, visible in Plate III (b), line 2, (e), first word, and (f), first word, and this type I have not seen in Bal . Apart from stage-directions and speakers' names, the old Bal. A appears to outnumber the new variety by about five to three. The E common in Bal. is a secretary letter, a rather malformed example of which may be seen in Plate II, f. 114 v , line 3. In Ann. this is replaced by an italic E that can be seen in Plate III (g). The switch from the secretary E of Bal. to the italic of Ann. would be perfect were it not for a curious single appearance of an italic E in Bal. , at f. 159 (not illustrated) and a balancing secretary E in Ann. , where it appears twice (at 3H6 , p. 164, and Tragedies p. 127. With the letter I the story is different, for the switch from the Bal. I to the new I of Ann. is, so far as I have discovered, flawless. Actually two types are common in Bal. — a crossed form (Plate II, f. 114 v , line 17) and a less correct form without the cross (f. 176 v , line 6). Neither of these have I seen in Ann. , where instead we everywhere find the quite different shape that can be clearly seen in Plate III (h), line 1. In view of the overwhelming evidence that one hand wrote the ballads and the Perkins annotations, we are forced to look for an explanation of the new types of three capital letters and two minuscules that make their appearance in the annotations that will be consistent with the view that Collier wrote these as well as the ballads. For this explanation we must go back again to the time when Collier began to learn the writing of an old hand. Clearly we can ascribe to him a superior manual dexterity and perhaps superior coordination of hand and brain. Even so it was a long and taxing labor —this learning to write a new hand. I can see him bent over his task for an hour or two at a time, day after day, week after week, slowly acquiring the automatic translation of thought into written words. For when a man writes he is unconscious of the shapes of letters, or only half conscious of them, and yet they come out in his own peculiar hand. Such facility Collier obviously possessed when he wrote, with remarkable consistency, more than a hundred and fifty pages of ballads in his old commonplace book. To have stuck at the learning of that hand he must have been strongly urged forward by an objective that was very important to him. It is not necessary to suppose that he had the Perkins folio in view from the start; in fact this is highly unlikely, since he was writing the hand with at least some facility more than fifteen years before he announced the discovery of the annotations. Ingleby reproduces, in his Complete View , many documents which Collier had "discovered" in the Bridgewater collection, in Dulwich College, and in other collections and had announced and printed, and which N. E. S. A. Hamilton had tracked down and found to be forgeries (as Halliwell-Phillipps and others had earlier suspected). One of these, in the Bridgewater collection, which Collier announced and printed in New Facts regarding the Life of Shakespeare (1835), is in a hand differing from that of the ballads only slightly. Several others are in hands differing only a little more, and in others the ballad hand can be seen, as it were, bleeding through the attempt to disguise it. For a short document Collier could in various ways quite consistently and with fair success give his hand a number of different appearances. But for an extended job, like the ballads, he had only one hand. When, in 1851 or 1852, Collier began work on the Second Folio he had no strong reason to fear detection, and it is therefore a little hard to understand why he wanted to alter his hand. It is even harder to see how he could have thought that altering two minuscules and three capitals could effectually disguise the hand. Nevertheless he appears to have made the attempt from the moment he began work on his new adventure in fabrication. But even in the small attempt he made at alteration, his inability to make the switch in his capital A and the minuscules g and w exhibits the difficulty of the task. Even so he must have been helped by the nature of the job, for few of his additions consist of more than one line, and not more than a couple of dozen are of more than four or five words. Probably eighty percent of the corrections, as he called them, consist of single words, a letter or two, or a mark of punctuation. There are certainly not less than 20,000 of them in all. This kind of writing would never be automatic; the writer would be working slowly and carefully. On the whole, I find it a little surprising that Collier's success in altering was not greater than we find it to have been. The fact, then, that a few letters in the annotations are different from those in the ballads does not weaken the strong evidence that both were written by one hand. The paleographical case against Collier is therefore complete. If weakness is found in the whole argument of this paper, it will hardly be found, I think, in the paleographical part of it, and if the demonstration that it was Collier who copied the ballads into his book falls short of mathematical proof, there is another point to be thought about. If Collier acquired his manuscript volume about 1840 and it then contained the ballads, he could hardly have failed to see, three or four years after he had copied out thirty-four of the ballads, that his remarkable annotated folio, assuming it to be genuine, was in the same hand. And if he saw it, why should he not have mentioned such a very remarkable coincidence?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 A manuscript in the Folger Library (M.a.229) consists of Collier's transcripts of S. R. entries from 1587 to 1601 — the first step, as is made quite clear, of a third volume of Extracts . The job is not finished, but the entries for the first few years are edited, much as he edited the earlier ones, except that here are no references to the old manuscript, no transcribed ballads. Nor can the titles of any of the ballads from the Register be matched with any of the eighty-three in the manuscript.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Description of Paper by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the peculiarities in the historical development of descriptive bibliography has been the small attention paid to paper. Since paper and inked type-impressions are the two principal physical ingredients of a book and since paper is the one which gives a book its most obvious physical characteristics (shape, size, weight, bulk), it would seem natural for a description of paper to occupy a prominent position in any description of a book. Yet the majority of descriptive bibliographies of the past make no mention of paper, except the indirect references afforded by an indication of format or leaf measurement. Those that do include some description of paper generally provide no more than a few words, such as "Wove paper, unwatermarked" or "Printed on white wove paper." 1 Some, like Fred H. Higginson's A Bibliography of the Works of Robert Graves (1966), offer bulk measurements and careful descriptions of watermarks. And occasionally a bibliography which does not give particular attention to paper recognizes its usefulness for analysis and identification, as when Karl Yost distinguishes the first printing of Millay's Renascence by the "AGM Glaslan" water-mark 2 or when Donald Gallup says of Eliot's The Dry Salvages , "Late copies of the first impression are printed on slightly thicker paper without the watermark adelphi." 3 But it is safe to say that most descriptive bibliographies — including many classic ones — make no attempt to record the nature of the paper used in the books under examination. There are several reasons for this situation. In the first place, the bibliographical interest in type-impressions has tended to deflect bibliographers' attention from the paper on which those impressions appear. It was natural that early bibliographers should have regarded type-impressions as the more promising field for analysis, since there are many immediately apparent impressions on every page and since the possibilities for variation in their arrangement, in the design of individual letters, and in the damage suffered by individual types are infinite. Because the nineteenth-century incunabulists found the analysis of type faces to be an effective tool in the identification of printers and the classification of editions, a concise description of type faces became a standard part of their descriptions of the books. Following in this tradition, bibliographers of Renaissance books have discovered important information about the printing of the books through elaborate analysis of typography and damaged types — information which, in turn, has a bearing on the establishment of texts. Furthermore, the natural interest in the text of a book serves in itself to call attention to typographical features, for the eye in reading observes the type-impressions more directly than the paper. As a result, misprints, broken types, or other typographical peculiarities which may serve to distinguish issues, states, or impressions are noticed and reported more frequently than the distinguishing features of paper. Given the historical evolution of analytical bibliography, descriptive bibliography, and editing, it is not difficult to see why typographical evidence has entered into descriptive bibliographies to a larger extent than have details about paper. 4 Another factor is the tradition of book collecting out of which descriptive bibliography grew. Some descriptive bibliographies—aimed primarily at collectors — have concentrated on those points which distinguish first impressions (or states or issues of first impressions). In the case of books issued in publishers' bindings or casings, one result has been an emphasis on the description of bindings and endpapers. Since publishers frequently do not bind all copies of an impression at one time but instead bind small batches as required, variant states of bindings are common occurrences, especially on nineteenth-century books; when priority can be established, collectors are often concerned with knowing the characteristics by which the earliest copies can be identified. The upshot is the absurd — but extremely common — situation in which a bibliographer describes the endpapers of a book, the binders' leaves, or the inserted advertisements in great detail, without ever mentioning the sheets on which the main text of the book is printed. In addition to these reasons for the neglect of paper, there is the simple one of ignorance: bibliographers have not known what to say about paper. They have generally been able, of course, to distinguish between laid and wove, to use the direction of the chainlines for assistance in determining format, and to compare the general characteristics of each leaf for identifying cancels. 5 But when it came to a description of paper in its own right, they could produce little more than a three-word phrase such as "white laid unwatermarked" — and even that, when included at all, was often inserted in a mechanical fashion, with seemingly little notion of the reasons for doing so. Paper-making is a complex field with an immense technical literature, 6 and any bibliographer who is not also a specialist in the study of paper may be expected to feel somewhat uncomfortable in confronting the task of describing it. The situation is analogous to that faced by the bibliographer in describing typography: he may be able to utilize evidence from type for analysis without being able to say much directly about the type, owing to a lack of technical knowledge and vocabulary. But, since bibliographers historically have examined type faces more often than paper, their knowledge of types, however fragmentary, is generally greater than their knowledge of paper. Nevertheless, many bibliographers have harbored a lingering uneasiness over this neglect, for in the back of their minds are always the classic examples of the use of paper evidence. As early as 1908, W. W. Greg discovered the false dating of the Pavier quartos of Shakespeare through a study of their watermarks; 7 in 1934 John Carter and Graham Pollard exposed the Wise forgeries by analyzing the ingredients of the paper; 8 and, most recently, Allan Stevenson has conclusively dated the so-called "Constance Missal" by comparing the states of the watermarks in it with occurrences of those watermarks in other books. 9 These are the spectacular achievements, but during the last thirty years there have also been several encouraging indications that increasing attention is being directed toward the description of paper as a routine part of bibliographical investigation. In 1942 A. T. Hazen said, in his introduction to A Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press , "I have paid special attention to the paper on which the books and Detached Pieces are printed; possibly to some people the development of this method will be the most interesting part of the book" (p. 10); and he proceeded, in the first entry, to prove that the thick-paper copies of Gray's Odes (1757) were printed in 1790 or later (pp. 24-29). Then in 1949 Fredson Bowers, in his Principles of Bibliographical Description , recommended that a paragraph on "Typography and Paper" be a standard part of a description (pp. 444-446); 10 a decade later two outstanding bibliographies appeared which included separate paragraphs on paper in each entry — Philip Gaskell's John Baskerville : A Bibliography (1959) and Allan Stevenson's Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt , Volume II (1961). And during the last two decades Stevenson, in many essays, has singlehandedly evolved a methodology for the bibliographical analysis of paper and has demonstrated the uses to which that analysis can be put. There can by this time be no doubt that a bibliographer's routine examination of a book is deficient if it does not include an analysis of paper as well as of type-impressions. The descriptive bibliographer is then faced with the question of how much of the information turned up in such analysis ought to be recorded in a descriptive bibliography. If a bibliography is regarded simply as a handbook for the identification of particular impressions or states, then only those facts would be reported which serve to distinguish impressions or states — the usual practice in the past. But if a bibliography is to take on its proper function and serve as a history of the forms in which an author's works have appeared and thus as a partial history of the book trade, details about paper become an important part of the descriptions, whether or not they furnish "points" for the recognition of impressions or states. The usefulness of paper evidence and the description of paper, though separate matters, are obviously related. As more descriptive bibliographers take seriously the responsibility of furnishing careful descriptions of paper, the store of information amassed in this way will become correspondingly more valuable as an aid to further investigation; conversely, progress in the bibliographical analysis of paper can only be slow if bibliographers, whenever they examine a book, do not contribute to that store of information by recording the characteristics of the paper as they observe them. It should go without saying, in other words, that a descriptive bibliography, if it is adequately to describe certain books as physical objects, is obligated to include some description of the paper used in those books. But bibliographers have no place to turn for detailed instructions about which features to record, how to present them, and how to vary the treatment so as to preserve the overall proportions of the description. A standard procedure for these matters is desirable, both to insure balanced coverage in the recording of information and to facilitate later reference to the information. The present state of research on paper — though much work remains to be done — is sufficiently advanced that it does not seem premature to begin thinking about such a procedure. I shall attempt, in the pages that follow, to draw together some of the previously formulated techniques for the description of paper and to make a few preliminary suggestions for presenting the material in a descriptive bibliography.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I One of the basic physical attributes of any object is its size, and the dimensions of the sheets of paper used in the production of a book naturally constitute one of the most important characteristics of that paper. Obviously the bibliographer, in order to determine those dimensions, cannot simply measure the sheet directly, since in most cases he has before him a copy of a finished book, in which the dimensions of the sheet have been obscured through folding and perhaps trimming. Specifying the dimensions of the original sheet can come only through the process of analyzing the evidence present in the finished book; even if the bibliographer has access to external documents (such as printers' or publishers' records) which list the size of the paper, he must still check the accuracy of the documents by examining the physical evidence. A consideration of the sizes of paper used in books therefore necessarily involves the question of format. 11 As a concept, of course, format has nothing directly to do with size, for it is merely an indication of the number of leaves which result from the folding of a sheet, whatever the size of the sheet. Quarto format means that a sheet has been folded twice to produce four leaves, but the term implies nothing about the dimensions of the sheet or the resulting leaves. 12 The designation of format in a bibliographical description, according to the Greg-Bowers formulary, is the first element in the collation line, not part of the description of paper: format is not one of the properties of paper but represents something done to the paper. However, since the bibliographer can measure directly only the dimensions of a leaf, he must know the format if he is to arrive at the size of the unfolded sheet. There will be many instances in which he has insufficient evidence to establish the format, and in these cases all he can give is the leaf measurement; but whenever the format can be discovered, he should provide an indication of the sheet, as well as the leaf, measurement. The use of certain characteristics of paper, such as chainlines and watermarks, to assist in determining the format of a book was one of the earliest techniques of bibliographical analysis. William Blades explained the method in the Library in 1889, 13 and further instructions appear in any of the introductory manuals of bibliography, such as those of McKerrow and Esdaile. 14 Many people, even with only a slight knowledge of bibliography, are acquainted with the well-established rules: vertical chainlines, watermark in the center of the leaf, and large rectangular shape signify folio; horizontal chainlines, watermark centered at the gutter in two leaves, and squarish shape signify quarto; vertical chainlines, watermark at the top edge of the gutter in four leaves, and rectangular shape signify octavo; and so on. It is true that this system will serve to identify the format of the large majority of books printed before the nineteenth century, 15 but there are instances in which it does not apply. For one thing, the procedure assumes that chainlines always run parallel to the shorter dimension of the original sheet and that the principal watermark is placed in the center of one half of the sheet. Actually, it is more accurate to say that chainlines run parallel to the shorter dimension of the mould ; sometimes large moulds were used to produce either double-size paper or two sheets side by side, with the result that the half-sheets or individual sheets — though the size of ordinary sheets — had chainlines running in the opposite direction from those in ordinary sheets. 16 Examples of these "turned chainlines," as they have been called, are not uncommon from the late seventeenth century onward, and bibliographers must keep the possibility in mind when determining format. But even though one recognizes turned chainlines, one cannot always be sure whether the original sheet was one of double size (cut in two before printing) or one of two separate sheets produced in the same mould. The pattern of deckle edges would of course settle the question, but for books of this period — before the introduction of publishers' binding — one rarely encounters copies which have not been trimmed down in the course of binding and rebinding, thus destroying the evidence which the deckle edge could provide. 17 When the matter cannot be settled conclusively, the clearest course is to follow Bowers's recommended procedure and use such a phrase as "(4°- forme) 8°" — meaning that the book has most of the characteristics of a quarto but is octavo in the sense that the amount of paper for eight of its leaves was in the mould at one time. 18 As for watermarks, their positions, too, can sometimes vary from the normal; 19 if, therefore, all the evidence except the watermark points to a particular format, the position of the watermark does not necessarily disprove it. Finally, the usual method presupposes the presence of chainlines and watermarks, but some books printed in the late eighteenth century, when the use of wove paper was increasing, do not offer these aids to bibliographers. In the case of later books, it is not the frequent absence of chainlines and watermarks which causes the chief difficulty in determining format but rather the widespread use of machine-made papers. Before the introduction of paper-making machines early in the nineteenth century, the size of sheets was limited to the size of the mould which one man could pick up; but after the technological revolution, which produced presses that could print larger sheets and machines that could manufacture them, the sizes of sheets used for books showed much greater variety. In addition, any chainlines present in machine-made paper are of no use for analysis since they are not a natural result of the manufacturing process but merely a design impressed upon the paper. Of course, whenever nineteenth- and twentieth-century books have been printed on handmade paper with chainlines, the standard method of analysis can be used just as effectively as for pre-1800 books; 20 but the point is that for the majority of books of these two centuries the traditional procedure is of no help. A modern book, for example, may have the same general shape as an old octavo and may even be gathered in eights, but it may well have been printed on quad sheets, each of which furnished four eight-leaf gatherings, so that the format is 32°. Although the number of leaves in a gathering cannot be taken in the books of any period as an indication of format, the two figures correspond far less often in post-1800 books than in earlier ones. It has long been recognized that the format of machine-printed books can frequently (perhaps usually) not be determined from physical evidence, 21 and bibliographers from McKerrow to Bowers have recommended that, for modern books, the dimensions of a leaf be substituted in the collation line for a designation of format. 22 As bibliographers begin to turn their attention to problems of machine-printed books, various new techniques for ascertaining format may be developed. But at present one of the few techniques available is the analysis of the edges of leaves, a technique which presupposes the existence of an untrimmed copy — indeed, an unopened copy, or at least one opened in such a way that it is still possible to tell which leaves were originally joined at the edges. Such conditions, while not common, are more easily found in nineteenth- and twentieth-century books than in earlier ones, since most modern books have been issued in publishers' bindings and, if issued untrimmed, may still remain so. In the case of an untrimmed — and, preferably, unopened — machine-printed book, one can sometimes work out the format by observing the pattern of joined leaves, or of rough edges where joined leaves have been opened. Using this method Oliver L. Steele has shown that the first edition of The Scarlet Letter was printed on double-size sheets, each of which formed two of the eight-leaf quires; 23 the format of the book could thus be described as octavo-form sextodecimo, and the size of the sheet could easily be calculated by multiplying both dimensions of the leaf by four. Steele has also detected in this way the 32° format of Cabell's Jurgen and the 64° format of Cabell's Gallantry and has recorded the patterns of the edges which can be used to recognize half-sheet imposition of eight-leaf quires in these two common formats. 24 One is often not so fortunate, however, in finding untrimmed copies and in working out the format, even with the aid of imposition diagrams in printers' manuals. 25 When this approach is not successful, one must search for errors or damage which can reveal format. For instance, if the leading and following edges of a forme receive most stress, examination of the locations of in-press type or plate damage may disclose the imposition and thus the format; Steele has used this technique to demonstrate that Glasgow's The Wheel of Life is 32°, with each sheet furnishing two copies of two consecutive eight-leaf gatherings. 26 In addition, such rare occurrences as errors in folding the sheets, creases which marred the sheets before folding, and failure to eliminate imposition figures can serve, when available, to help determine format. 27 But in many cases the format cannot be established, and the bibliographer must then of necessity allow a leaf measurement to stand as a substitute for an indication of format. For books of all periods, once a format has been determined, the bibliographer is ready to supply the first element in a description of paper — the specification of the size of the sheet. He simply multiplies the dimensions of the leaf the proper number of times to correspond with the format 28 and checks to see whether the resulting dimensions approximate one of the sheet sizes known to have been standard, or at least common, during the period in question. The match can rarely be more than a rough approximation for two reasons: the dimensions of the original sheet can be expected often to be larger than those obtained by multiplying the dimensions of the leaf, since the sheet may have been trimmed in binding (and, in the case of repeatedly rebound older books, trimmed several times); and paper sizes in use at any time have always exhibited numerous variations from the norms, while the norms themselves have shifted from period to period. Nevertheless, the bibliographer, in his role as historian, should attempt to make some correlation between the size he has calculated and one of the sizes actually available at the time. Despite the considerable amount of historical research on paper, 29 information about paper sizes in different periods is not easy to come by. The English paper trade, from at least some time in the seventeenth century, 30 has employed a series of names — ranging from "Post" through "Crown" and "Demy" to "Royal" and "Imperial" — to designate sheet sizes, and these names were also common in America 31 until the twentieth century. Apparently some of the names originally referred to watermarks but gradually came to stand for certain relative sizes of sheets, regardless of what watermarks they bore. Although a great many names have been used at various times, there are only seven of primary importance in connection with paper for printing: Foolscap, Post, Crown, Demy, Medium, Royal, and Imperial. However, with the addition of such adjectives as "Super," "Large," "Double," "Extra," and the like, a bewildering array of individual designations has been constructed. While the relation of all these names to each other has remained virtually unchanged over the years, the specific measurements attached to each have varied considerably, and the standard sizes adopted by law or agreement in one period are not always retained unaltered by a later generation. The whole matter is extremely complex, and it seems unrealistic to require of descriptive bibliographers any great precision in the naming of these sizes. Sometimes the differences between two standard sizes are small enough that the bibliographer, unsure how much paper has been trimmed off in the copies he has examined, will have no basis for choosing between them; in any case, he cannot always know with certainty the exact dimensions of the sizes available. What seems more reasonable, therefore, is to expect him only to name the general size class to which the sheets he is describing probably belong. It is more meaningful historically to refer to the sheets of a given post-seventeenth-century book as "Crown," if they seem to fall within the range of the sizes which at one time or another have been labeled "Crown," than to attempt to infer the exact measurements of the sheets used, since these inferred measurements may not in fact have been the actual ones. Although many books provide short lists of these English size names, the most useful source for the bibliographer is E. J. Labarre's Dictionary and Encyclopaedia of Paper and Paper-Making (2nd ed., 1952), which contains a long table of names (pp. 252-267), arranged alphabetically and giving the various dimensions which have been attached to each name. 32 For quick reference, the following brief list may prove convenient. It shows the modern standard and the customary range of variation for the seven basic names, as extracted from Labarre's table and his individual entries for these words; the first figures are inches, those in parentheses millimeters: Standard Variation Foolscap 17 x 13.5 15 x 12.75 / 18.5 x 14.5 (431.8 x 342.9) (381 x 323.85 / 469.9 x 368.3) Post 19 x 15 18.75 x 15.25 / 20 x 16 (482.6 x 381) (476.25 x 387.35 / 508 x 406.4) Crown 20 x 15 19 x 15 / 20 x 16.5 (508 x 381) (482.6 x 381 / 508 x 419.1) Demy 22.5 x 17.5 18 x 14.5 / 23 x 18 (571.5 x 444.5) (457.2 x 368.3 / 584.2 x 457.2) Medium 23 x 18 21 x 16.5 / 24 x 19 (584.2 x 457.2) (533.4 x 419.1 / 609.6 x 482.6) Royal 25 x 20 22.25 x 18 / 26 x 20 (635 x 508) (565.15 x 457.2 / 660.4 x 508) Imperial 30 x 22 28 x 20.5 / 36 x 24 (762 x 558.8) (711.2 x 520.7 / 914.4 x 609.6) A companion table in Labarre, which may be of even greater initial use to bibliographers, arranges the names in the order of the sizes (pp. 268-272). All the sizes of printing papers recorded in his table are listed below (along with the millimeter equivalents in paren-theses): 15 x 12.5 (381 x 317.5) Pott 17 x 13.25 (431.8 x 336.55) Foolscap 17 x 13.5 (431.8 x 342.9) Large Foolscap 18.5 x 14.5 (469.9 x 368.3) Small (or Pinched) Post 19 x 15 (482.6 x 381) Post 20 x 15 (508 x 381) Crown 20 x 16 (508 x 406.4) Copy; Tea Copy 20.75 x 14.375 (527.05 x 365.13) Music Demy; Short 21 x 14 (533.4 x 355.6) Large Half Royal 21 x 16.5 (533.4 x 419.1) Large Post 22.5 x 17.5 (571.5 x 444.5) Demy 23 x 18 (584.2 x 457.2) Medium 23.5 x 19.5 (596.9 x 495.3) Sheet-and-a-half Post 24 x 19 (609.6 x 482.6) Small Royal 25 x 15 (635 x 381) Double Pott 25 x 20 (635 x 508) Royal 26.5 x 16.5 (673.1 x 419.1) Double Foolscap 26.5 x 22.5 (673.1 x 571.5) Sheet-and-a-half Demy Square 27.5 x 20.5 (698.5 x 520.7) Super Royal 28 x 21 (711.2 x 533.4) Double Music 28 x 23 (711.2 x 584.2) Elephant 29 x 19 (736.6 x 482.6) Small Double Post 30 x 20 (762 x 508) Double Crown 30 x 22 (762 x 558.8) Imperial 30 x 25 (762 x 635) Quad Pott 30 x 30 (762 x 762) Sheet-and-a-half Demy Double Crown 30.5 x 19 (774.7 x 482.6) Double Post 33 x 17.75 (838.2 x 450.85) Sheet-and-a-half Demy Usual 33 x 21 (838.2 x 533.4) Double Large Post 33 x 22 (838.2 x 558.8) Large News 34 x 27 (863.6 x 685.8) Quad Foolscap 35 x 22.5 (889 x 571.5) Double Demy 36 x 23 (914.4 x 584.2) Double Medium 38 x 28 (965.2 x 711.2) Double Globe 40 x 25 (1016 x 635) Double Royal 40 x 27 (1016 x 685.8) Double Elephant 40 x 30 (1016 x 762) Quad Crown 40 x 32 (1016 x 812.8) Quad Post 41 x 27.5 (1041.4 x 698.5) Double Super Royal 44 x 30 (1117.6 x 762) Double Imperial 45 x 35 (1143 x 889) Quad Demy 50 x 40 (1270 x 1016) Quad Royal 55 x 31.5 (1397 x 800.1) Double Atlas 56 x 38 (1422.4 x 965.2) Quad Globe The bibliographer who has reason to feel confident that he has determined the exact dimensions of a sheet can, by checking this list, cite a precise name (a basic name with its modifying adjectives). Although these lists will serve to identify in general terms the sheet sizes of the majority of English and American books since the seventeenth century, they can profitably be supplemented by other tables or sources of information for particular periods. A bibliographer dealing with eighteenth-century books should certainly take advantage of the research of Philip Gaskell and Allan Stevenson, both of whom have worked out tables for that period. 33 At other times one can utilize specimen books which reflect the standard practices of a period. For instance, the book of paper samples issued in 1855 by T. H. Saunders of London gives 151 specimen sheets of handmade, machine-made, and special papers, along with a table of contents providing the name for the size of each sample. 34 Modern American paper, following the standardization codified in 1923 by the National Bureau of Standards (and revised in 1932), is not referred to by the traditional English names but simply by the dimensions of the standard sheets (millimeters are given here in parentheses): 29 x 26 (736.6 x 660.4) 44 x 33 (1117.6 x 838.2) 32 x 22 (812.8 x 558.8) 44 x 34 (1117.6 x 863.6) 35 x 22.5 (889 x 571.5) 45 x 35 (1143 x 889) 36 x 24 (914.4 x 609.6) 46 x 33 (1168.4 x 838.2) 38 x 25 (965.2 x 635) 48 x 36 (1219.2 x 914.4) 39 x 26 (990.6 x 660.4) 50 x 38 (1270 x 965.2) 40 x 26 (1016 x 660.4) 51 x 41 (1295.4 x 1041.4) 41 x 30.5 (1041.4 x 774.7) 52 x 29 (1320.8 x 736.6) 42 x 28 (1066.8 x 711.2) 56 x 42 (1422.4 x 1066.8) 44 x 28 (1117.6 x 711.2) 56 x 44 (1422.4 x 1117.6) 44 x 32 (1117.6 x 812.8) 64 x 44 (1625.6 x 1117.6) Foreign paper sizes, though different from the English and American in dimensions and names, are roughly parallel to them, and introductory information on the foreign systems is available in Labarre (pp. 251-252, 282-290) and in Stevenson's table. For books issued during the first two centuries of printing, when paper sizes were less standardized and names had not become attached to particular sizes, the bibliographer can do little more in describing a given book than report the inferred sheet-dimensions of the largest copy known; but in addition he may wish to survey other bibliographies and bibliographical studies 35 in order to gain some idea of the sizes prevalent at the time and make some comparative comment. Sometimes an estimate of a sheet size can be made on the basis of the size of the type page and the inner margin 36 or on the basis of the location of the tranchefiles, which often appear as chainlines traversing a sheet of paper roughly six or seven millimeters from each end. Regardless of the period, the lengths to which the bibliographer is obliged to go in attempting to establish actual sheet sizes depends on the individual situation — the condition of the books he is describing (whether or not they are uncut or are thought to be only slightly trimmed), taken in conjunction with the characteristics of the period involved (whether or not paper sizes were standardized or at least fairly regular). When these factors allow the possibility of accuracy in naming the sheet size, the bibliographer ought to do whatever research is necessary to achieve that accuracy; but when, as is more often the case, these factors permit only a rough approximation in specifying the sheet size, the bibliographer can simply refer to such lists as those provided here. Once the original sheet size is ascertained, either precisely or approximately, the bibliographer has to decide how to enter the information in his description. Since minimum sheet-dimensions can be calculated on the basis of direct measurement of the leaves and since any indication of the original name or size of a sheet is generally an inference based on that direct measurement, the description should emphasize the former (which constitutes demonstrable evidence) rather than the latter (which usually constitutes speculation). An economical way of achieving this emphasis is to begin the description with the demonstrable measurement (the longer dimension preceding the shorter), followed in parentheses by the speculated name or dimensions of the original sheet. When an uncut copy is available for examination, the calculated dimensions and the original dimensions coincide, and the figures can be given without qualification; but when trimmed, or possibly trimmed, copies are the only ones available, the measurements based on the largest examined copy must be prefixed with "at least," or some equivalent phrase, and the inferred name or size with "probably": 25 x 20 (Royal) . . . 24.5 x 19.5 (a variety of Royal) . . . at least 24.5 x 19.5 (probably Royal) . . . at least 24.5 x 19.5 (probably Royal, 25 x 20) . . . at least 26 x 19.75 (probably a variety of Royal, 26 x 20) . . . at least 31 x 21.75 (probably 32 x 22) . . . Thus the first two examples are based on uncut copies, and the figures can be taken as proved facts; in the first instance the dimensions are exactly those of the standard Royal sheet, but in the second — as the phrase "a variety of Royal" makes clear — they fall within the range historically covered by the name "Royal." The third example, based on a trimmed copy, gives the minimum sheet-dimensions (signaled by "at least"), based on the maximum known leaf-dimensions; since these figures come close to the standard for Royal, one can then add the speculation "probably Royal." If there is additional evidence for judging the amount cut off, one may wish to include a specific estimate of the dimensions, as in the next two examples. The last illustration represents a trimmed modern American book, with the probable standard sheet size given only in figures and not named. This arrangement of the information not only emphasizes what is factual and subordinates what is conjectural but also provides a standardized form applicable to all circumstances — for whenever a regular or probable size cannot be postulated, as often with early books, the parenthetical comment can simply be eliminated. It goes without saying that, when format itself cannot be established and the leaf-measurement replaces the format abbreviation in the collation line, nothing need be said about size in the paragraph on paper. Two further problems in the specification of size should be commented on: the degree of accuracy required and the system of measurement to be employed. Questions of accuracy are part of the whole matter of tolerances, 37 but in general it can be said that one should follow Bowers's recommendation of measuring leaves to the nearest thirty-second of an inch ( Principles , p. 431) — or, in the metric system, to the nearest millimeter. In practice, however, only the bibliographer who is intimately acquainted with a particular situation can say just what tolerance is meaningful or appropriate. The presence of deckle edges in an untrimmed copy of a given book may render ridiculous the idea of measuring to the nearest millimeter, though one should attempt, as Bowers suggests, to measure to an imaginary line drawn through the base of the deckle (checking the measurement in several leaves). On the other hand, a situation may arise, in connection with a machine-trimmed book, which requires the bibliographer to take readings to the nearest half-millimeter if he is adequately to distinguish certain states, issues, or impressions. The question of what system of measurement to use — inches or millimeters — has been discussed in the past 38 with inconclusive results. Although the theoretical advantages of the metric system are obvious, English and American bibliographers are accustomed to measuring in inches, and paper sizes in both countries have traditionally been expressed this way. Despite the weight of tradition, it seems desirable to utilize the same system of measurement throughout a bibliographical description, and the metric system has already become established for certain measurements, particularly those relating to typography in incunabula (the dimensions of the type page and the size of the type face as reflected in the measurement of twenty lines). Furthermore, it has been recommended for the typography of all periods, 39 and whatever system is adopted for type measurements should certainly be employed for paper measurements also, to facilitate the comparison of type-page size with leaf size. The DIN system of standardized paper sizes, based on the metric system, has been adopted by many countries, and in 1959 the British Standards Institution endorsed it as an alternative to the traditional British system. 40 There is no question but that, in the field of paper as in most other fields, the general trend in measurement is increasingly toward the metric system. In the light of these considerations, as well as of the inherent convenience of the millimeter as a unit, the bibliographer would be well advised to adopt the metric system. 41 For this reason, the lists given above provide metric equivalents for the usual inch-sizes of paper (1” = 25.4 mm.); if the bibliographer feels awkward in mixing the traditional names with millimeters, he can always include both sets of figures: 635 x 508 (Royal) or 635 x 508 (Royal; i.e., 25” x 20”) at least 622 x 495 (probably Royal, 635 x 508) or at least 622 x 495 (probably Royal, 635 x 508 [= 25” x 20”]) Inserting the inch measurements should eliminate any objection to the historical inappropriateness of associating the metric system with the size names; and the slight inconvenience of making the adjustment is far outweighed by the advantages gained in the ease with which the figures can be manipulated and compared with others in the description.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II After the specification of the size of the sheet, the next fact to be recorded in a description of paper is an indication of the markings in the sheet — chainlines and watermarks. An adequate accounting of these features involves (1) stating whether the paper is laid or wove and, if laid, measuring the distance between the chainlines; 42 and (2) describing any marks present (watermarks or countermarks), identifying them if possible. All paper before approximately 1756 was "laid" — that is, made in moulds, the bottoms of which consisted of wires parallel to the longer dimension and crossed perpendicularly at wider intervals by heavier chains. After that date, with the introduction of moulds containing a finely woven wire mesh, "wove" paper (which bears no easily discernible crossing lines) was possible, though it did not come into wide use until near the end of the century. 43 Nineteenth- and twentieth-century machine-made paper can also be classified as "laid" or "wove," but the terms in this connection refer only to patterns impressed on the paper, since those patterns are not the result of anything functional in the manufacturing process. In the bibliographical description of pre-1800 books, therefore, it is unnecessary to specify the paper as "laid": any paper not specifically labeled can be assumed to be laid, and those late eighteenth-century instances of wove paper can be explicitly marked "wove." Strictly speaking, the mention of "laid" is superfluous even for later paper, since the indication of the distance between the chainlines makes clear the fact that the paper has a laid pattern; nevertheless, since the laid pattern is no longer predominant, it is probably more sensible in post-1800 books to specify "laid" or "wove" in each instance. For books of all periods, if there is no watermark, this part of the description is quite simple: it consists either of the single word "wove" or of a phrase such as "laid, chainlines 18 mm. apart." 44 Of course, "unwatermarked" is understood in each case, but it does no harm to add the word "unwatermarked" (or "unmarked") after the words "wove" and "laid." When a watermark is present, it is the bibliographer's duty to provide as accurate a description of it as possible, following the general procedure which he would use in describing any other kind of pattern 45 — that is, a combination of a verbal statement with a reference to a visual standard. The verbal statement may be expanded or contracted according to the relative accuracy and accessibility of the illustration cited as a standard, but certain minimum information should always be included: a brief indication of the general form of the mark (as "crown" or "bull's head") and a measurement of the maximum height and width of the mark (with the height preceding the width). 46 Allan Stevenson has suggested a convenient system for recording such measurements so that they reveal, at the same time, the distance between the chainlines and the position of the watermark in relation to the chainlines. 47 In this system, whichever dimension of the watermark crosses the chainlines is recorded in brackets, with the distance to the nearest chainline on either side entered on each side of the brackets. Thus the notation "6[28]4" would mean that the mark is 28 mm. wide at its widest point, with one chainline running 6 mm. to the left and another 4 mm. to the right, when the mark is viewed "right side up" and from the mould side of the sheet (the side with the indentations from the chains and wires); and the chainlines would be 38 mm. apart. If a chainline cuts through the watermark, the bracketed measurement can be divided with a vertical stroke at the proper place: thus in "6[13|15]4," the chainlines are 19 mm. apart, and one of them runs through the watermark 13 mm. from one side and 15 mm. from the opposite side. It is frequently unnecessary, therefore, to specify separately the distance between chainlines, since this system of watermark measurement includes that information and, in addition, shows the relationship between the two measurements: laid, with bull's head tau mark, 49 x 4[13|10]7 In this example the chainlines are 17 mm. apart, and it would be superfluous to add a phrase explicitly saying so. For machine-made papers, however, the relationship between the laid pattern and the watermark is less important, and it may seem more sensible in some instances — particularly when the watermark appears several times in a sheet in different positions relative to the chainlines — to give the measurements separately: laid, with mark reading 'WARREN'S | OLDE STYLE', 40 x 8[16|24|24|20]4 or laid, chainlines 24 mm. apart, with mark reading 'WARREN'S | OLDE STYLE', 40 x 84 In handmade papers, on the other hand, any difference in the position of a watermark relative to the adjacent chainlines provides significant evidence for bibliographical analysis, and the variation should always be noted: 48 bull's head tau mark, 49 x 5[28]5/4[28]6 It is also a good idea, for purposes of documentation, to cite after every measurement a leaf (or leaves) which provides an example of the watermark with the specified measurements: bull's head tau mark, 49 x 5[28]5 (B4)/4[28]6 (G4) Watermarks obviously will be easier to measure in some formats than in others — indeed, when handmade papers are involved, folio is generally the only format in which one can measure the entire watermark at one time. Nevertheless, it is often possible to construct an accurate measurement by piecing together the measurements of the portions of the watermark visible in various leaves; but when too much of the watermark is hidden in the gutter of a tightly bound volume or has been trimmed off in the process of binding, an approximate measurement must be given, preceded by some such notation as "at least" or "about." Following the verbal description of the watermark should come a parenthetical reference to an illustration of that mark. Such a reference is an important part of the bibliographer's responsibility: it helpfully supplements the verbal description, since some users of a bibliography may require, in particular instances, a more precise idea of the design than can manageably be expressed in words and figures; and it places the mark in a larger historical context through associating it with a published illustration which has been (or can be) cited by other bibliographers under similar circumstances. A number of large compilations of tracings of watermarks have been published; when the bibliographer locates in one of them a tracing which is identical with (or closely resembles) the mark in question, he can enter the name of the work and the tracing number in his description. If no standard collection of tracings seems to include the mark, the bibliographer can provide an illustration in his own section of illustrations (and the parenthetical reference would then be simply to this illustration in the same volume). It is usually preferable in descriptive bibliography, when one is dealing with designs or patterns, to cite whenever possible a separately published standard rather than an illustration provided for the particular occasion. With watermarks, however, the situation is different. Since tracings are inadequate for modern bibliographical analysis of watermarks, a reference to a tracing is less helpful than a reproduction of a good photograph of a watermark. If large collections of photographs of watermarks were available in published form, it would often be unnecessary to provide individual photographs; but since no such reference works exist at present, a bibliographer who furnishes photographs of watermarks, far from creating an unnecessary proliferation, is usefully contributing to the meager published supply. These considerations are not meant to suggest that there is no point in referring to the standard collections of tracings, for they have their uses: they assist in classifying watermarks; they provide approximate representations of a large number of marks; and they furnish leads for additional research. Citations of published tracings are, therefore, still appropriate; but, ideally, reference should also be made to photographs. To understand why tracings are inadequate — in fact, to make any positive identification of a watermark at all — the descriptive bibliographer must be familiar with the revolutionary techniques which Allan Stevenson has developed for analyzing watermarks. In a series of brilliant articles beginning in the late 1940's, he demonstrated some of the ways, unrecognized before, in which watermarks can furnish evidence for bibliographical analysis; 49 the monument of the method, his book on The Problem of the Missale speciale (1967), draws all these techniques together and uses them to solve a celebrated problem. 50 As a result of his work, analysis of watermarks is now an established bibliographical tool, and no bibliographer can be said to have examined a book properly without giving its paper the same careful attention which has long been accorded to typographic matters. Stevenson's method stems from the basic discovery that individual watermarks can be positively identified by their "sewing dots." In the mould, the watermark pieces were attached to the wires and chains by means of thin wire thread; at each of the points where the watermark was fastened, this thread formed a small lump which left its mark in the finished paper as if it were part of the design itself. Since only a remote coincidence could result in any two watermarks of the same design being attached to the wires and chains at exactly the same spots with the same relative amounts of thread, examination of the patterns of sewing dots can provide conclusive identification of the mould in which a given piece of paper was produced. Moulds were regularly used in pairs with supposedly identical watermarks, 51 and many pairs, unrelated to each other, contain quite similar designs; but analysis of the sewing dots can distinguish between individual moulds in every instance. Tracings are not detailed enough for this kind of research, whereas photographs 52 — or, preferably, beta-radiographs 53 which reproduce watermarks without reproducing the inked type-impressions over them — can be better for study than the paper itself. Indeed, the future of watermark study lies in radiography, and the student of paper will need to carry with him a Carbon 14 source. Stevenson has further shown how variant states of individual watermarks can be recognized and employed for such purposes as dating. As a mould was used, some of the threads would loosen or break and allow the watermark to slip or to bend out of shape; and periodically, as this deterioration was noticed, it would be repaired, but the repaired state would not be identical with the original state. Therefore, by examining sewing dots, one can not only identify a watermark but also place any state of it chronologically in relation to another state of the same watermark; in other words, one can distinguish variations which signify separate watermarks from those which merely constitute states of a single watermark. Since the life of a mould in normal use was about a year, and since long runs of paper in a book are more significant for dating than stray remnants which the printer may have had on hand for a considerable time, one is sometimes able, by combining all the evidence, to date a book with remarkable precision — just as Stevenson assigns the Missale to 1473, probably between February and October. The descriptive bibliographer cannot be expected to consider an extensive investigation of watermarks — of the kind Stevenson performed for the Missale — a routine part of his description of every book. What should be expected is that he be aware of the techniques at his disposal; that he employ them whenever necessary to establish, or assist in establishing, basic facts in the printing and publishing history of a book; and that in every case his ordinary description of paper reveal his awareness of the needs of bibliographers who employ these techniques. For example, providing the measurements of a watermark in addition to a brief verbal description helps in itself to distinguish among similar watermark designs; but if the bibliographer also includes in his figures the relation of the watermark to the chainlines, he is, in brief space and with little additional effort, offering a fact of great potential usefulness to those engaged in paper study. Since the watermark ordinarily slipped to the right in the mould (to the left on the sheet, viewed from the mould side), observation of the shifting distances between the watermark and the adjacent chainlines can help to establish a sequence of successive states of the watermark. 54 Such evidence must eventually be used in conjunction with that from sewing dots; but since the precise locations of sewing dots cannot be indicated conveniently or accurately in words or numbers and since the locations of the chainlines in relation to the watermarks can be so indicated, the descriptive bibliographer is in a position to supply at least this much initial data about watermark states. The fact that he does not find it necessary, in terms of the book he is describing, to pursue the investigation of the watermark further does not mean that another bibliographer, dealing with a different book which may have been printed on the same paper, will not be greatly assisted by the information. The second bibliographer will no doubt have to look at the paper himself, but the point is that the first man's bibliography served as a guide telling him where he could go to find some paper relevant to his own study. As more bibliographies include this kind of information, the mass of accumulated data will become increasingly useful, and bibliographies will be fulfilling all the more successfully their role as storehouses of information on the bookmaking practices of a given period. The identification of a watermark, as Stevenson has revealed, involves more than the location of a similar mark in one of the published collections of tracings. But the bibliographer who understands the limitations of such collections will also know how to utilize them intelligently, and providing references to these collections must remain a requirement of any description of a watermark. Stevenson has offered good instruction in this area by explaining how to use Briquet's Les Filigranes in his introduction to the Paper Publications Society's magnificent edition of that work (1968). 55 The bibliographer cannot claim to have done his basic research if he has not attempted to locate any watermark he describes in the relevant published collections. The largest and most famous is Charles M. Briquet's Les Filigranes (1907), with its 16,112 tracings; but since it does not extend beyond 1600 and does not cover Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia, and Britain, the bibliographer must expect to turn to other collections as well and should be familiar with the most important ones. The Paper Publications Society, founded in Hilversum, Holland, in 1948 by E. J. Labarre, has performed an invaluable service both in fostering the production of new works on watermarks and in reprinting older ones with masterful commentary and annotation. Its edition of Briquet, for example, contains 151 large pages of supplementary material, including many pages of addenda and corrigenda; and the wealth of information available in its main series of volumes, the "Monumenta Chartae Papyraceae Historiam Illustrantia," should not be overlooked by any descriptive bibliographer. Students of English books should in particular know the following works, two of which were issued by the Paper Publications Society (PPS): Edward Heawood, "Sources of Early English Paper-Supply," Library , 4th ser., X (1929-30), 282-307, 427-454; "Papers Used in England after 1600," XI (1930-31), 263-299, 466-498; "Further Notes on Paper Used in England after 1600," 5th ser., II (1947-48), 119-149; III (1948-49), 141-142. [567 tracings] 56 W. A. Churchill, Watermarks in Paper in Holland , England , France , etc. , in the XVII and XVIII Centuries and Their Interconnection (1935). [578 tracings] Edward Heawood, Watermarks , Mainly of the 17th and 18th Centuries (PPS, 1950). [4078 tracings] 57 Alfred H. Shorter, Paper Mills and Paper Makers in England , 1495-1800 (PPS, 1957). [217 tracings] But since a large proportion of English books before the seventeenth century were printed on imported papers, the bibliographer of these books must also be acquainted with Briquet; and bibliographers in general should also know the principal foreign collections, at least the ones brought out by the Paper Publications Society — those by Zonghi, Eineder, Uchastkina, Lindt, Tromonin, Bofarull y Sans, and Voorn, and The Nostitz Papers — and a few others such as Midoux-Matton, LeClert, Nicolaï, Piekosinski, Klepikov, and Likhachev. 58 When it is necessary to go beyond these works, a convenient list to consult is E. J. Labarre's A Short Guide to Books on Watermarks (1955), 59 which describes 82 titles. A bibliographer, finding in one of these books a tracing which corresponds to the watermark in question, enters the name of the author and the serial number of the tracing in his description; if he provides a photograph of his own, his primary reference is to that photograph, with an added note asking the reader to compare certain published tracings: dolphin mark (Briquet 5873), 35 x 1[23]1 (C4) or dolphin mark (Plate 7; cf. Briquet 5873), 35 x 1[23]1 (C4) Since tracings are never exact reproductions, it is unnecessary to use "cf." when the only reference is to one tracing (though it may be prudent to do so). 60 When the match is so inexact that nothing more specific than a whole class of marks can be cited, the "cf." can conveniently be used with the inclusive numbers referring to that class; it can also be employed when two or more individual tracings are cited, as a way of indicating the less exact of them. The brevity and wording of the verbal description are to some extent determined by the citations. If there are no citations of published tracings — either because the watermark is in modern machine-made paper or because, even though earlier, it does not correspond with any located tracing — the verbal description must be more ample than would otherwise be necessary; but if a tracing is cited or a specific photograph is provided, the verbal description can be quite brief. The form of the wording, however, should in all cases conform as much as possible to an accepted standard, so that the same figures will not be called different names by different bibliographers. A. F. Gasparinetti has suggested, to bring about this uniformity, that Briquet's terms (or their equivalents in other languages) be used, even when one is referring to other works. 61 The proposal is sensible, since Briquet's collection is the largest and since the equivalents of his French terms have been provided in several languages both in The Briquet Album and in the 1968 edition of Les Filigranes . 62 Longer verbal descriptions, when required to compensate for the lack of citations, need not be elaborate but should always include quasi-facsimile transcriptions of words or numbers; when the situation warrants, of course, more detailed treatment can be furnished, either as an appendage to the paragraph on paper or in the "Notes" section. Any countermarks or subsidiary marks can be recorded in exactly the same way as the main marks. Stevenson, in the Hunt Catalogue , employs a long equals sign between the description of a main mark and that of a countermark; 63 the device is convenient, but, if one wishes to use words instead, one can simply insert "countermark" ("cornermark," "edgemark") or "countermark reading": dolphin mark (Briquet 5873), 35 x 1[23]1 (C4) = 'IV', 10 x 6[13]6 (C1) or dolphin mark (Briquet 5873), 35 x 1[23]1 (C4), and countermark 'IV', 10 x 6[13]6 (C1) This treatment of watermarks, countermarks, and chainlines is not time-consuming and requires little space in the final description; yet it provides essential information for an identification of paper and records facts of potential significance for further bibliographical analysis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III In addition to the dimensions and the markings, there are many other characteristics of paper which the bibliographer could conceivably take into account. The paper industry has developed a wide range of procedures and machines for testing various properties of paper in order to maintain standards and to identify precisely the features of any given sample. Although these tests are usually applied to modern machine-made paper, they could be employed to ascertain the characteristics of earlier papers as well. Some of them are not appropriate for bibliographical work, but the bibliographer should be aware of the general range of physical, chemical, and optical characteristics which are mechanically testable. The physical characteristics can be subdivided into five categories: (1) substance, involving such matters as basis weight, thickness, bulk, and bulking thickness; (2) strength, as revealed by tests for tensile strength (e.g., Schopper static tester, Van der Korput dynamic tester), bursting tests (Mullen, Schopper-Dalen), tearing tests (Elmendorf), and folding tests (Schopper); (3) permeability and absorbency (as tested by the Gurley densometer, the Potts permeability apparatus, the Cobb method, the Currier apparatus, and so on); (4) formation (as indicated by the degree of uniformity of transmitted light); and (5) smoothness (judged by microscopic or photographic techniques or by the flow of air between the paper and a standard surface). The chemical characteristics can be determined by tests for (1) the fiber and mineral constituents of a furnish; (2) the sizing agents (gelatin, rosin, casein); and (3) acidity and alkalinity (both colorimetric and electrometric tests). Finally, the optical properties fall into three groups: (1) color (tested against a standard or by spectrophotometer) and whiteness (tested by the Zeiss Leukometer); (2) gloss (surface reflectance measured by such instruments as the Ingersol Glarimeter or the Sheen Gloss meter) and brightness (General Electric Brightness meter or Institute for Paper Chemistry Automatic Color and Brightness Tester); and (3) opacity (measured by a photometer). 64 Some of these tests can be ruled out immediately for bibliographical purposes because they entail destruction or mutilation of the paper (all the tests for strength fall into this category). Others, though they do not damage the paper, are impractical for a bibliographer to undertake because they involve precision instruments which are not easily portable and are not available in libraries (many of the optical tests fall into this category). In any case, the details established by most of these tests are not of primary relevance to bibliographical studies. Since a verbal description of a physical object necessarily represents a selection of details out of an infinite number of possible details, an intelligent description depends on a systematic selection of details made in the light of the purposes for which the description is intended. The elaborate tests performed in the paper industry do not provide exhaustive coverage of every conceivable property of paper, but they furnish those details necessary for the efficient operation of the industry. Similarly, the description of paper in a bibliography should record only those characteristics which are of primary interest to the persons for whom the bibliography is prepared—in general, students of literature, of history, and of printing and publishing. One cannot, of course, say that such details as the tensile strength or the chemical composition or the opacity of paper are necessarily irrelevant to historical study; the student of book production in a particular period would doubtless be happy to have a large body of such information available for his use in author-bibliographies. But one can say that these kinds of detail are not of primary importance to the majority of users of a bibliography and that the practical difficulties they involve outweigh their usefulness for this audience. If, in certain instances, some of these details do turn out to be of significance in establishing the printing history of a book, they can then be recorded — the classic case is Carter and Pollard's use of evidence regarding the composition of paper in detecting the Wise forgeries. Only the bibliographer who has a detailed knowledge of a particular situation will be in a position to decide whether or not some of these tests are likely to be fruitful for his purposes; when he thinks they may be, he can turn for assistance to an appropriate laboratory, but it would be absurd to require him to go to such lengths as part of the ordinary routine of bibliographical description. 65 In the light of these considerations, only two of the tests employed in the paper trade — those for thickness and color — seem appropriate for bibliographical use, while a third group of the tested characteristics — those relating to finish — can be treated bibliographically in a less precise fashion. (1) Thickness . The measurement of paper thickness is one of several related measurements of primary importance in the paper industry. Of these, the basic measurement is that of the "substance" of paper, generally expressed in terms of "basis weight" — that is, the weight per standard unit area (usually, per ream of specified dimensions). 66 Thus the designation "35 x 45, 100 lbs., 516's" describes a paper of which a 516-sheet ream, with each sheet measuring 35 x 45 inches, weighs 100 pounds. A more convenient method of indicating substance, based on the metric system, is to specify grams per square meter; in this way only one figure need be given, since it is not dependent on the size of the sheet. Instead of saying "35 x 45, 100 lbs., 516's," one can simply say "87 g.s.m." 67 Although the substance of paper is one of its most prominent characteristics, measurement of substance cannot normally be performed in bibliographical work, since the bibliographer is not usually in a position to weigh the sheets of a book separately from the binding, endpapers, and inserted plates. If he cannot make this measurement, then he cannot present other figures based on it, such as "bulk," the ratio of the thickness of a sheet to its substance. 68 The thickness of a sheet, on the other hand, is not obscured when the sheet is folded and bound into a book; it is thus available for direct measurement by the bibliographer, and it should be reported in his description of paper. Measurement of the thickness of a single sheet of paper is performed with a micrometer caliper. Many styles of micrometers are available (both spring-actuated and dead-weight-actuated), and most of them can be used for measuring paper thickness; since suitable pocket models can be purchased for about $30, every bibliographer should have one as part of his standard equipment. 69 They are manufactured with dials graduated in fractions of inches or in fractions of millimeters, and the bibliographer should choose one with a dial corresponding to whichever system is being used for other measurements. 70 The sheets of a given book may vary in thickness, according to the micrometer readings, and the significance of such variation may differ according to the period and type of paper. In handmade paper, if the chainlines and watermark suggest that all the sheets were intended to be "the same paper," certain variations in thickness may be of no importance, and one can report either an average reading or the range of readings; but in machine-made paper a slight difference in thickness between two sheets can indicate that two stocks of paper were used and may even be important in distinguishing between two impressions. 71 Therefore, one should normally take a micrometer reading on one leaf in every sheet (if not on every leaf, as a test for cancels). When a representative reading for each paper is arrived at, one simply records the reading in the description, along with the citation of a specific leaf which yields that reading, in some such form as the following: "thickness .003 in. (B3)," or "thickness .076 mm. (B3)," or "thickness 76μ (B3)." 72 Some bibliographers in the past have reported the thickness of all the sheets of a book taken together, in such a form as "sheets bulk 1 7/16 in." This kind of measurement is useful in enabling a reader to visualize the thickness of a book and serves as a guide to the "bulking thickness" of the paper. When the figure for the total thickness of the leaves of a book is divided by the number of leaves, the resulting figure is nearly always larger than that representing the thickness of a single sheet as measured with a micrometer; this larger figure is known as the "bulking thickness" and is an important characteristic of paper. For these reasons the bibliographer should continue to record the total bulk of the sheets (and perhaps the calculated bulking thickness of a single sheet), even though a micrometer reading of the paper thickness is given also. Such a measurement, however, is often not very precise because it can vary with the amount of pressure applied to the sheets when the measurement is taken and with the particular place on the edge of the book chosen for measurement. The center of the top edge is usually the best place to measure if a ruler is used, but calipers that reach in to the center of the leaves provide a more dependable reading; whichever method is employed, only those leaves comprising the sheets that went through the press are to be measured, excluding any endpapers and binder's leaves. 73 Even with these precautions, the measurement is not dependable enough to be relied upon in bibliographical analysis whenever much precision is required. If, for example, some copies of a particular book are printed on uniform paper throughout and other copies include one gathering made up of heavier paper, the variation in total bulk between copies of each kind may be so slight as to seem insignificant to the bibliographer; he may dismiss the variation (especially if he does not have copies yielding the two readings side by side) as due simply to the ways in which he held the copies when taking the measurements. But if he had taken micrometer readings of each sheet, he would have known that the variation resulted from the presence of a heavier sheet in some copies. Of course, chainlines and watermarks also serve to distinguish between papers in some books; but, for books printed on wove unwatermarked paper, micrometer measurement may be the only easy way of detecting mixed papers — and thus of locating what may be called "sheet-cancels" (substituted sheets rather than single leaves), not uncommon in machine-produced books. 74 Whenever a book does contain mixed papers, the figure for bulking thickness (as opposed to total bulk), if it is to have meaning, must be given separately for each different paper and must be based on the bulk of particular sections of the book; in such cases, dividing the total bulk of the entire book by the number of leaves gives only an average and tells one nothing about the bulking thickness of the individual papers involved. For this reason, figures for bulking thickness — when they are deemed significant enough to report — should be associated not with the figure for total bulk but with the other characteristics of the individual papers. A convenient way to put the figures for bulking thickness in proper perspective is to place them immediately after the figures for the thickness of single sheets (with a parenthetical indication of the section of the book which served as the basis for the calculation): "thickness .076 mm. (B3), bulking .079 mm. (B-G)." The one figure for total bulk of the sheets should come later in the description, since it is a feature of the finished book, not a characteristic of any of the papers involved. (2) Color . The most precise way of specifying color, in paper as in other objects, is in terms of spectrophotometric measurement; but a simpler — yet reliable and scientific — method, also used when appropriate in the paper industry, is visual comparison against a standard. Since the Centroid Color Chart worked out by the Inter-Society Color Council and the National Bureau of Standards has been recommended for other instances of color specification in bibliographical description, 75 it is an appropriate choice for the reporting of color in paper also. Certainly the same system of referring to color should be used throughout a bibliography, and the ISCC-NBS dictionary offers a convenient way of converting all specifications to the ISCC-NBS system regardless of the color chart originally employed. Furthermore, Deane B. Judd, writing in the Paper Trade Journal , has specifically shown the applicability of the ISCC-NBS names to the description of paper. 76 The advantages of the system, in terms of general acceptance and convenience, outweigh its two chief disadvantages: the glossiness of the centroid color chips and the limited distinctions the centroid chart makes among the common colors of printing papers. The two are related, for the less fine the discrimination required in specifying color, the less important the distortion created by surface texture. Of the 267 ISCC-NBS color-name blocks, only seven are of much use in describing the papers generally employed for printing books: white (Centroid 263), pinkish white (9), yellowish white (92), greenish white (153), bluish white (189), purplish white (231), and light gray (264). The colors of the majority of book papers, in fact, fall nearer the centroid chip for "white" than any of the other chips. Several methods of measuring and specifying more accurately the various degrees of whiteness in paper have been developed in the paper industry, 77 but under most circumstances the bibliographical significance of the precise color of paper is not great enough to warrant the use of spectrophotometers and other elaborate equipment. In unusual instances the bibliographer may find it necessary to turn to these methods; but he need not make them part of his standard routine, for the information they yield would often prove more distracting than helpful to the readers of descriptive bibliographies. Ordinarily, therefore, the distinctions among near-whites provided by the ISCC-NBS centroid chips, though not subtle, are adequate for bibliographical purposes. Indeed, since the nearest match will usually be "white," a bibliographer may wish to establish the convention within an individual bibliography that all papers described are white unless otherwise specified; on the other hand, it does no harm to repeat "white" in each instance, since the word takes little space and emphasizes the fact that the color of the paper has been taken into account. It is perhaps unnecessary to cite the centroid number for white, but for other colors a parenthetical reference to a visual standard should always be provided. If a bibliographer describes a paper as "yellowish white (Centroid 92)," the reader knows that the color of the paper, though not necessarily an exact match, falls within that color-name block of which centroid chip 92 is representative. (3) Finish . The finish of paper is one of its most prominent characteristics, involving such related properties as gloss, brightness, and smoothness. Since the general roughness or glossiness of a piece of paper immediately catches the eye, it is reasonable to expect that a description of paper should take this quality into account. The only accurate way of measuring gloss, however, is in terms of the surface reflectance of light, and the test for smoothness is in terms of the surface flow of air; these procedures again involve instruments which make finer discriminations than are generally usable or meaningful in a bibliography. What will usually suffice, for bibliographical purposes, is a simple verbal description of gloss and smoothness, preferably in the form of a single adjective (since the two qualities, except when measured by instruments, are difficult to separate). Although a standard series of adjectives exists in the paper trade — "antique," "eggshell," "vellum," "machine," and "English" (for uncoated papers), or "dull," "semidull," and "glossy" (for coated papers) 78 — any attempt to employ these terms without reference to a visual standard or recourse to numerical measurement would tend to accentuate the problem of subjectivity. Other similar series could be formulated — such as "very rough," "rough," "medium," "smooth," and "extra glossy" 79 — without reducing the difficulty of deciding where the lines between the categories should be drawn. Besides, would any two bibliographers agree on these lines, and could even a single bibliographer observe them consistently? Such considerations render impractical the attempt to establish on this level any multiterm sequence. Yet it is usually not difficult to secure agreement that certain papers are "rough" and others are "glossy." The most sensible course of action, therefore, is to use "rough" to describe uncoated papers which have a pronounced roughness and "glossy" to describe coated papers which have an unquestionably shiny surface; for all papers in between, whether coated or uncoated, one can use "smooth," or possibly no adjective at all, implying that only wide variations from the norm need be specified. Such a tripartite scheme does not eliminate subjective judgment but merely reduces the number of dividing lines where it must operate. When instruments or visual standards are not to be employed, it is futile to attempt subdividing a continuum into more than a few large sections if the results are to convey the same meaning to different people. For bibliographical purposes, distinguishing "rough" and "glossy" papers from the broad range in between is usually adequate and comprehensible; if a bibliographer needs on occasion to employ greater precision, he should turn to the appropriate instruments rather than increase his stock of adjectives and intensifying adverbs, which are more likely to confuse than to refine his description. 80 The specification of finish, like that of color and thickness, tends to have greater significance in connection with machine-made and wove papers than with handmade and laid papers. Variations in these characteristics in hand-produced paper, given the nature of the process, may be of little importance in distinguishing separate runs, whereas such variations in machine-made paper, with its greater regularity, may be of more consequence for identification; similarly, precise notation of these properties in laid (and particularly watermarked) paper may not be especially helpful, since the chainlines and watermarks generally provide sufficient identification, whereas such notation for wove (and particularly unwatermarked) paper may be quite useful, since there is little else to rely on. Thus the advantages of having detailed information about these characteristics rarely outweigh the difficulties of obtaining and utilizing it when the paper under examination is handmade, laid, or watermarked; for these papers the unsophisticated approach described here is often adequate. On the other hand, the usefulness of precise data about these matters may well justify the efforts entailed when the paper being analyzed is machinemade, wove, or unwatermarked; for these papers significant differences may be overlooked if precision instruments are not employed. All one can say is that any bibliographical description of paper should be expected to take some account of thickness, color, and finish. For the most part, the techniques used can be quite simple; but, when the occasion warrants, the bibliographer — aware of the more elaborate methods available to him — should not hesitate to turn to the laboratory for aid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV All of these characteristics, which constitute the main part of a bibliographical description of paper, have to do with the sheet, not the leaf — that is, they are characteristics of the paper itself, not of the paper as it happens to be folded in a particular book (though some of them obviously must be inferred from the paper as folded). But at the end of the description two characteristics of the leaf — or the paper as it appears in the finished book — ought to be appended: the dimensions of the leaf 81 and the total bulk of the leaves. 82 These figures are important, first of all, because they represent direct measurements and thus serve as documentation for some of the inferences presented earlier in the description. In addition, being directly observable, they are sometimes of more immediate assistance to users of a bibliography than such figures as those for the dimensions and thickness of the sheet. Even for a book published before the time of edition binding, every copy of which may exhibit a different leaf size, a report of the leaf dimensions of the largest known copy is helpful, both to support the inference about sheet size and to serve as a conveniently usable standard of comparison. As for bulk, even though it is difficult to obtain precise figures, sometimes two issues of a book differ so greatly in bulk that even approximate figures are adequate to distinguish them. For example, two issues of the first printing of O'Neill's The Moon of the Caribbees and Six Other Plays of the Sea (1919) can be distinguished by the paper: one bulks 18 mm. and the other 24 mm. The difference is pronounced enough that, even though the figures are not really precise, one has no difficulty in determining to which issue a particular copy belongs. 83 In this case the figures for total bulk are more immediately useful for identification than the information that the thickness of each sheet of one issue is .160 mm. and of the other .216 mm. Furthermore, if the bulking thickness were reported as .165 mm. for the first and .220 for the second, the figures for total bulk would be necessary to indicate the basis of the calculation. Leaf dimensions and total bulk, therefore, though not actually characteristics of paper itself, serve an important function in a bibliographical description of paper. Also, it is useful to record at this point, for laid paper, the direction of the chainlines in relation to the leaf. The kinds of detail and the accuracy of measurement suggested here represent a somewhat fuller description of paper than is often found in bibliographies but clearly not the most elaborate description possible. Indeed, the procedure recommended here is intended to occupy a middle ground — detailed enough to provide information for identification and for historical study, and yet not so burdensome as to be self-defeating. It may be helpful to think of this procedure as occupying the middle stages in a series of graduated levels. 84 The lowest level, frequently employed in bibliographies in the past, is the simple designation of paper as either laid or wove. A second level, only slightly more detailed, includes a brief indication of any watermarks and perhaps a reference to color and finish. Although there will continue to be situations in which this brief sort of description is sufficient, it cannot now be considered appropriate for a full-scale descriptive bibliography. Instead, the descriptive bibliographer will operate on one of the next two levels: the third, which entails direct measurements with a ruler (distances between chainlines, dimensions of watermarks, and total bulk and dimensions of the leaves); and the fourth, which involves inferences (to establish the dimensions of the sheets), recourse to reference works (to identify the watermarks), and use of a micrometer (to measure the thickness of individual sheets). 85 Beyond this level, two more may be postulated, but the bibliographer will move to them only in unusual cases: the fifth, in which the paper is subjected to one or more laboratory tests; and the sixth, in which the paper, on the basis of these tests, or reference to specimen books, or other research, is traced to an individual manufacturer or mill. The bibliographer who has examined a large number of copies of a given book will be best able to judge whether or not laboratory tests are worth investigating in that particular instance; though bibliographers in the past have been excessively reluctant to avail themselves of such assistance, it would be equally foolish to overestimate the value of laboratory tests for bibliographical work. As a general rule — subject to exceptions in special cases — what one can reasonably expect of a bibliographer in his description of paper is a level of detail equivalent to the fourth level described here. After these characteristics of paper have been ascertained, there remains the problem of how best to record them in a descriptive bibliography. Since so little attention has been given to paper in the past, no accepted practice in this regard has become established. The only tradition which can be said to exist derives from the two major bibliographies which include paragraphs on paper, Gaskell's Baskerville and Stevenson's Hunt catalogue; their record of paper takes the following forms: 86 Paper: Brownish, poor quality Large Printing Demy laid, watermark fleur-de-lys / IV, size of sheet 21 x 17¼ in. Paper: Crown, Genoese, with double chains, countermarked IV and corner OO. Plates in text: same paper. Frontispiece: thick paper with single chains, countermarked IV. Leaf 13.1 x 8.6” = sheet [14 x 18”]. This pattern — the size-name of the paper, followed by a designation of chainlines and marks, with the leaf measurement at the end — is the basis for the sample forms presented below. They are purely hypothetical examples, designed to suggest ways of handling a variety of situations: paper. Sheets : at least 500 x 376 mm. (probably Crown, 508 x 381); laid, with dolphin mark (Briquet 5873), 35 x 1[23]1 (B4) / 0[23]2 (G3), and countermark 'IV', 10 x 6[13]6 (B1); thickness .244 (B4), bulking .250 (B-P); light gray (Centroid 264). Plates : laid, chainlines 22 mm. apart; thickness .272; light gray. Leaves : at least 376 x 250 (B4); chainlines vertical; total bulk 14 mm. paper. Sheets ( A-D , I-M ): wove, unwatermarked; thickness .203 mm. (I1), bulking .207 (I-M); bluish white (Centroid 189); glossy. Sheets ( E-H ): wove, unwatermarked; thickness .221 (E1), bulking .227; white (263); glossy. Frontispiece : wove, unwatermarked; thickness .279; bluish white; glossy. Leaves : total bulk 20.5 mm. The first represents a book which is printed on laid watermarked paper and for which the format can be determined; the second represents one which is printed on two kinds of wove unwatermarked paper and for which the format is not known. Various modifications will naturally suggest themselves in particular instances. It is more important, of course, to be concise, unambiguous, and consistent within a given bibliography than to follow uncritically a form prescribed in advance; on the other hand, in the absence of special difficulties, a prescribed form is to be preferred over individual variations, since it leads to greater uniformity among bibliographies in general and thus to greater ease of reference. The approach to the description of paper suggested here would not, in most cases, involve a great investment of time, nor would the resulting paragraph occupy much space on the printed page. Yet the information amassed in this way — particularly after a large number of bibliographies had recorded such details — would be of incalculable value to the historian of paper and of book production; and a descriptive bibliography cannot be said to have fulfilled its function unless it provides this kind of historical data. In any event, paper is a major ingredient of the printed book, and it is only common sense to expect a description of a book to include some comments on paper. There are signs that more bibliographical attention is now beginning to turn in this direction. Even the technical research into paper deterioration has given some impetus to the historical study of nineteenth-century paper 87 and has caused certain present-day publishers to include in their colophons the results of various paper tests. 88 And Allan Stevenson's work has dramatically demonstrated to bibliographers that the investigation of paper can play a significant role in bibliographical analysis. A bibliographer cannot know just what aspects of paper are going to take on greater importance for analysis in the future but by recording certain basic facts about size, watermarks, thickness, and the like he can help to accumulate the data upon which new discoveries will rest. The descriptive bibliographer is a historian, and one measure of his success is the extent to which he gives paper — like any other element of the book — its rightful place in the total picture. 89</field>

West and then by Jack Weiner), which covers the period 1900-55 in five volumes and the years since 1955 in annual volumes; it includes — especially under the headings "History" and "Watermarks" — material of interest to bibliographers which is not always reported in the checklists that bibliographers more frequently consult. Another basic guide to this field is the Abstract Bulletin of the Institute of Paper Chemistry (1930- ); a useful shorter collection of abstracts is Jack Weiner and Lillian Roth, Paper and Its Relation to Printing (Institute of Paper Chemistry Bibliographic Series No. 164; 2nd ed., 1962).

And James G. McManaway, in his contribution to Standards of Bibliographical Description (1949), commented on the neglect which paper study had suffered (p. 68). 11 An important treatment of the general subject is Graham Pollard, "Notes on the Size of the Sheet," Library , 4th ser., XXII (1941-42), 105-137. See also Lawrence Wroth, "Formats and Sizes," Dolphin , I (1933), 81-95; and David Foxon, "Some Notes on Agenda Format," Library , 5th ser., VIII (1953), 163-173. 12 Nor about the number of leaves in a gathering, for a gathering can consist of half a sheet or of several sheets and still represent the same format (the same number of leaves per full sheet).

Dunkin, How to Catalog a Rare Book (1951), pp. 31-56. 15 In rare cases additional kinds of evidence may turn up, such as the printed lines which showed the binder where to make the cut-off in duodecimo; see Giles E. Dawson, "Guide-Lines in Small Formats (About 1600)," SB , XIV (1961), 206-208. 16 See A. T. Hazen, "Eighteenth-Century Quartos with Vertical Chain-Lines," Library , 4th ser., XVI (1935-36), 337-342; and Kenneth Povey and I. J. C. Foster, "Turned Chain-Lines," Library , 5th ser., V (1950-51), 184-200. Several books from the fifteenth century have been noted in which some leaves appear to represent different formats from other leaves, as a result of certain sheets having been cut in half (or quartered) before printing; see Curt F. Bühler, "Chainlines versus Imposition in Incunabula," SB , XXIII (1970), 141-145. 17 If one could count on the presence of a single main watermark in the center of one half of every sheet, whether a double sheet or one of the companion sheets from a double mould, one could use watermarks as a guide; but the lack of regularity in the placing of watermarks makes this test unreliable. 18 Bowers's discussion of turned chainlines is in Principles , pp. 193-195. A related example is taken up in Richard J. Wolfe, " Parthenia In-Violata : A Seventeenth-Century Folio-form Quarto," BNYPL , LXV (1961), 347-364. 19 See Edward Heawood, "The Position on the Sheet of Early Watermarks," Library , 4th ser., IX (1928-29), 38-47. 20 Although handmade papers can be made in unusually large sizes by having more than one man manipulate the mould. 21 Charles Evans in 1876 considered it "practically impossible at the present time to correctly define the size of a modern book in the old manner"; see "The Sizes of Printed Books," Library Journal , I (1876-77), 58-61. 22 McKerrow, p. 164n.; Bowers, pp. 429-430. 23 Steele, "On the Imposition of the First Edition of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter ," Library , 5th ser., XVII (1962), 250-255. He further demonstrates that the book was printed by half-sheet imposition, with each forme containing the inner and outer subformes of a single quire. 24 Steele, "Half-Sheet Imposition of Eight-Leaf Quires in Formes of Thirty-Two and Sixty-Four Pages," SB , XV (1962), 274-278. 25 Practically all of the many printers' manuals published during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries contain imposition diagrams applicable to machine printing; a convenient one for reference is Theodore Low DeVinne's Modern Methods of Book Composition (1904), or his Book Composition , ed. J. W. Bothwell (1918). 26 Steele, "Evidence of Plate Damage as Applied to the First Impressions of Ellen Glasgow's The Wheel of Life (1906)," SB , XVI (1963), 223-231; part of his study also consists of an effective statistical analysis of the reliability of the sample of 150 copies which he examined. For some comment on the "leading edge" in modern half-sheet imposition, see Oliver L. Steele, "A Note on Half-Sheet Imposition in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Books," Gutenberg Jahrhbuch 1962 , pp. 545-547. 27 J. D. Thomas, in "A Modern Instance," PBSA , L (1956), 302-304, describes this kind of error in the folding of a sheet in the second edition of Besterman's World Bibliography of Bibliographies ; and Matthew J. Bruccoli and Charles A. Rheault, in "Imposition Figures and Plate Gangs in The Rescue ," SB , XIV (1961), 258-262, demonstrate the intended 64° format of the second impression of the second edition of Conrad's The Rescue through an analysis of the surviving imposition figures which identify the four-page plate gangs. 28 For folio, the shorter dimension of the leaf would be doubled; for quarto, both dimensions would be doubled; for octavo, the shorter would be quadrupled, the longer doubled; and so on. 29 The standard general history is Dard Hunter, Papermaking : The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft (1943), which includes a highly selective checklist of other historical treatments. Some additional checklists, which can serve as partial guides to the mass of historical research, are mentioned in footnotes 6 and 59; items before 1800 are described in Dard Hunter, The Literature of Papermaking, 1390-1800 (1925); and work since 1949 can be located through the annual SB checklists. 30 See R.

Hazen, in "Eustace Burnaby's Manufacture of White Paper in England," PBSA , XLVIII (1954), 315-333, reproduces a 1691 announcement of a paper auction, showing many names (but not dimensions) of paper sizes. 31 See the examples from 1821 reported by Lyman Horace Weeks in A History of Paper-Manufacturing in the United States, 1690-1916 (1916), pp. 119-120. 32 Bibliographers who consult Labarre's Dictionary should also be acquainted with Allan Stevenson's review of it in the Library , 5th ser., IX (1954), 59-63, which makes comments on some size-names not included in Labarre.

Lucy E. Osborne (1933), pp. 49-54. 36 For an illustration of the method, see Curt F. Bühler, "The Margins in Mediaeval Books," PBSA , XL (1946), 34-42. Bühler mentions two sizes of medieval paper, 43 x 32 and 45 x 30 cm.; and he estimates that the average type page was 68% x 45% of the total height of the paper, that the inner margin was 8-10% of it, and that the height of the type page was equal to the breadth of the leaf. Cf. A. W. Pollard, "Margins," Printing Art , X (1907-8), 17-24; and "Margins," Dolphin , I (1933), 67-80. 37 For general comments on this subject, see G. T.

Eugene M. Ettenberg, "Is Type Measurement Overdue for Change to the Metric System?", Inland Printer/American Lithographer , CLXII (January 1969), 48. 40 See British Standard 3176: 1959. Cf.

C. Kenneison and A. J. B. Spilman, Dictionary of Printing , Papermaking and Bookbinding (1963), pp. 211-213. In the DIN system, the basic sheet has an area of one square meter, and its dimensions are in the ratio of the side to the diagonal of a square (1:√2) — i.e., 1189 x 841 mm. Such a sheet is referred to as "A0"; "A1" is the sheet resulting from a halving of the longer dimension (841 x 594); "A2" from another halving (594 x 420), and so on. A "B" series (based on a 1414 x 1000 sheet) establishes intermediate sizes between those of the "A" series; long sizes may be specified in terms of a fraction of a standard size, as "¼ A4" (210 x 74). 41 The printed catalogue cards prepared by the Library of Congress express the height of books and the dimensions of broadsides in centimeters, and these practices are recommended in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (North American Text, 1967), pp. 210-211. 42 The direction of the chainlines in the sheet need not be mentioned unless it is unusual; the direction of the chainlines in the leaf — like other facts about the folded form of the sheets — should be recorded later, at the end of the paragraph on paper. 43 See A. T. Hazen, "Baskerville and James Whatman," SB , V (1952-53), 187-189; and Thomas Balston, William Balston , Paper Maker , 1759-1849 (1954), James Whatman , Father and Son (1957), and "Whatman Paper in a Book Dated 1757," Book Collector , VIII (1959), 306-308. 44 The importance of chainlines for bibliographical analysis in tests for cancels and conjugacy — not simply their distance apart but also the leaf-patterns of mould- and felt-sides as revealed by the indentations of chainlines — is discussed by Allan Stevenson in "Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence," SB , VI (1954), 181-195. 45 See G. T. Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Description of Patterns," SB , XXIII (1970), 71-102. 46 "Height" and "width" here refer to the mark itself; for some marks, therefore, the larger figure will appear second. 47 "Paper as Bibliographical Evidence," Library , 5th ser., XVII (1962), 200. An example of the use of chainspace measurements is Stevenson's "Tudor Roses from John Tate," SB , XX (1967), 15-34. 48 Since moulds were regularly used in pairs (see below, note 51), the presence of companion watermarks need not be specifically mentioned; however, a difference between the two can be conveniently recorded in this fashion: "bull's head tau mark, (I) 49 x 5[28]5, (II) 49 x 4[28]6." 49 See especially Observations on Paper as Evidence (1961), and "Paper as Bibliographical Evidence," Library , 5th ser., XVII (1962), 197-212; for a brief statement, see "The Natural History of Watermarks," in C. M. Briquet, Les Filigranes , ed. Stevenson (1968), pp. *20-23. In one of his earlier articles, he demonstrated how watermarks can be useful in the detection and analysis of press variants, the sequence of formes through the press, and related problems: "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," SB , I (1948-49), 151-182. For his discussion of chainlines, see above, note 44. 50 A condensed version of the argument appears in his "Paper Evidence and the Missale speciale ," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1962 , pp. 93-105. 51 Stevenson, "Watermarks Are Twins," SB , IV (1951-52), 57-91. 52 See T. Gerardy, "Die Fotografische Registrierung von Wasserzeichen," Papier-geschichte , XVI (December 1966), 22-25. The use of sensitized paper to make direct photographs of watermarks was suggested at least as early as 1904 by Gilbert R. Redgrave, in "The Water-Marks in Paper," Library , 2nd ser., V (1904), 91-92. 53 See J. S. G. Simmons, "The Leningrad Method of Watermark Reproduction," Book Collector , X (1961), 329-330, which describes the method first announced in 1960 by D. P. Erastov and also used in J. L. Putman's Isotopes (1960); O. K.

Another important list of material, limited to the period before 1600, is in C. M. Briquet, Les Filigranes , ed. Stevenson (1968), pp. *37-53; an earlier list is Dard Hunter, Handmade Paper and Its Watermarks : A Bibliography (1916). See also E. J. Labarre, "The Study of Watermarks in Great Britain," in The Briquet Album (1952), pp. 97-106. 60 Stevenson, in the Hunt Catalogue , uses "cf." and also explains concisely its significance: "The references to Heawood, Churchill, Voorn, Nicolaï, and others are not to marks from the same moulds (which are difficult to be sure of from tracings) but to sufficiently similar marks for the reader's understanding" (p. clxxix). 61 Gasparinetti, "On the Adoption of a Universal Terminology for Watermarks," in The Briquet Album , pp. 122-124. 62 The Briquet Album , pp. 125-154 (English, German, Italian); Les Filigranes , pp. *109-131 (French, English, German). 63 Gaskell, in the Baskerville bibliography, uses an oblique line for this purpose; oblique lines have been suggested above, however, as separators for variant measurements. 64 The basic tests for paper are outlined in any of the standard works on paper manufacture. See, for example, Julius Grant, A Laboratory Handbook of Pulp and Paper Manufacture (1942), pp. 179-297 (which includes a good analysis of the appearance of fibers, pp. 251-258); Robert H. Clapperton, Modern Paper-Making (3rd ed., 1952), pp. 450-464; J. Newell Stephenson (ed.), Manufacture and Testing of Paper and Board (1953); C. Earl Libby (ed.), Pulp and Paper Science and Technology (1962), II, 373-398; Robert R. A. Higham, A Handbook of Papermaking (1963), pp. 72-86; and Victor Strauss, The Printing Industry (1967), pp. 577-580. An important introduction to the subject of paper testing is Paper and Paperboard : Characteristics, Nomenclature and Significance of Tests (ASTM Special Technical Publication No. 60-B; 3rd ed., 1963); it provides, at the beginning, a list showing the correspondences between the two sets of test standards, those of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and those of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI). The ASTM standards are set forth in Part 15 of the Book of ASTM Standards , issued annually; the TAPPI Standard Testing Procedures are available in two loose-leaf volumes, revised continually. A Bibliography of Paper Testing appears in the Institute of Paper Chemistry Bibliographic Series as Nos. 154-156 (2nd ed., 1954, with supplements in 1960 and 1965) and Nos. 157-159 (2nd ed., 1960). 65 Cf. Tanselle, "Tolerances," pp. 5-6. 66 See TAPPI Method T410-os and ASTM Method D646. 67 Tables of equivalences, for converting pounds per ream to grams per square meter, are available; see, for example, Clapperton, Modern Paper-Making , pp. 496-497. 68 The term "bulk" is also used to mean the total thickness of a given number of sheets, and it is in this sense that the word may appear later in a bibliographical description of paper to indicate the combined thickness of the folded sheets in a finished book. 69 Micrometers for official paper testing must conform with TAPPI Method 7411-m44 and ASTM Method D645-64T and have .0001” graduation; but most dial micrometers with .001” graduation are adequate for bibliographical work. 70 A convenient pocket micrometer, satisfactory for bibliographical purposes, is the Ames Thickness Measure No. 25 (with .001” graduation) or No. 25M (with .01 mm. graduation), manufactured by the B. C. Ames Co., Waltham, Massachusetts 02154; or the Cady Pocket Micrometer, Model CPM (with .001” graduation), manufactured by E. J. Cady &amp; Co., Chicago 60635. 71 Few bibliographers in the past have utilized micrometer measurements of thickness to distinguish impressions. For an exception, see Matthew J. Bruccoli and Joseph Katz, "Scholarship and Mere Artifacts: The British and Empire Publications of Stephen Crane," SB , XXII (1969), 277-287 (esp. p. 278). 72 A micron (μ) is equal to one thousandth of a millimeter and is an appropriate unit for expressing the thickness of paper. 73 See Bowers, Principles , p. 446. 74 Obviously leaf-cancels can often be located by micrometer measurements also, and one can argue for this reason that micrometer readings should be taken on every leaf of a book, not just on every sheet. One cannot rely on the detection of stubs as the sole method for finding cancels, and chainlines and watermarks are not always present; micrometer measurements are therefore an invaluable aid in approaching the problem of cancels in machine-produced books printed on wove paper — a problem set forth by John Carter in "Some Bibliographical Agenda," in Nineteenth-Century English Books (1952), pp. 68-70. 75 See G. T. Tanselle, "A System of Color Identification for Bibliographical Description," SB , XX (1967), 203-234. 76 Judd, "Systematic Color Designations for Paper," Paper Trade Journal , CXI (17 October 1940), TS201-TS206. 77 For a brief list of works on this subject, see SB , XX (1967), 233. 78 Definitions of these terms can be found in The Dictionary of Paper (3rd ed., 1965). 79 This series is suggested by William Bond Wheelwright in "Identification of Paper Samples," Paper &amp; Printing Digest , V (September 1939), 3-9. 80 Among the twentieth-century specimen books which offer samples of various finishes, two comprehensive ones are A Book of Samples of Paper (Champion Paper Co., 1922) and, especially, Paper for Books : A Comprehensive Survey of the Various Types of Paper Used in Book Production (Robert Horne &amp; Co., 1953, 1961). 81 Of course, if the format of a book cannot be determined and the dimensions of the leaf are given in the collation paragraph, they need not be repeated here. 82 The treatment of the edges (stained, rough-trimmed, and so on) is more appropriately specified in the paragraph on binding, since it is not a characteristic of the paper but represents something done to the paper in the process of binding. 83 Bulk measurements which include the covers and endpapers are cited for this book in Merle Johnson, American First Editions , ed. Jacob Blanck (4th ed., 1942), p. 401. Higginson's Graves bibliography reports two figures for bulk (as "1.8/2.3 cm."), one for the sheets and endpapers and another for the sheets, endpapers, and covers. However, bulk measurements should properly include only the sheets; if in rare instances a variation in the thickness of the covers is significant, the information can be recorded in the paragraph on binding. 84 The idea of a series of levels to represent the spectrum of possible details for investigation was suggested by Kenneth L. Kelly's use of this device in "A Universal Color Language," Color Engineering , III (March-April 1965), 2-7; further comments on its usefulness in descriptive bibliography are found in the essay on "Tolerances" cited above (note 37). 85 The degree of accuracy of measurements is a separate question from the quantity of detail. Generally speaking, dimensions of sheets and leaves, as well as total bulk, should be reported to the nearest millimeter (or the nearest thirty-second of an inch) and thicknesses of paper to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter (or of an inch). 86 The first of these descriptions is from Philip Gaskell, John Baskerville : A Bibliography (1959), entry 37; the second is from Allan Stevenson, Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt , II (1961), entry 466. 87 See, for example, Strength and Other Characteristics of Book Papers, 1800-1899 (1967), Publication No. 5 in the series on Permanence/Durability of the Book (1963- ), issued by the W. J. Barrow Research Laboratory of Richmond, Va. 88 A recent example occurs in The National Union Catalog : Pre-1956 Imprints (1968- ), where the paper on which the work is printed is described in this fashion: "Substance 89 gsm / pH cold extract 9.4 / Fold endurance (MIT ½ kg. tension) 1200 / Tear resistance (Elmendorf) 73 (or 67 x 3) / Opacity 90.3%." 89 I am grateful to the late Allan Stevenson and to Dr. Philip Gaskell for their generosity in taking time to read a manuscript version of this article.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The first quarto (1615) of Beaumont and Fletcher's Cupids Revenge is the only text of the play with claim to authority. But the extent of its reliability is less than assured. Because of the singular position of Q1 in the textual tradition, its degree of authority can be inferred only from a close bibliographical analysis of the quarto itself. Such an analysis is the purpose of this paper. Its intention is to provide the bibliographical evidence to which the editorial decision for a critical text can be referred. 1 Its concern is therefore not so much with the text as with the securing and testing of that evidence. The printing process has been investigated, and the data that shed light on it, such as the arrangement of the text on certain pages, or the stages of compositorial work as they are recognizable from the use and re-use of type, were considered in great detail. The working habits of compositors were distinguished. The analysis of the quarto of Cupids Revenge was at all critical stages controlled by reference to the closely parallel conditions of composition and printing in a second dramatic quarto, that of Wentworth Smith's Hector of Germany . Thus, the matter that is here most immediately presented for its relevance to the printed text of Beaumont and Fletcher's Cupids Revenge , is, in more general terms, also a contribution to the study of printing in an early seventeenth-century London printing-house. On April 24, 1615, the two plays were entered in the Stationers' Register for Josias Harrison. 2 Cupids Revenge was written before 1612. It was acted at Court in January, 1612, and again in January, 1613, by the 'Children of her Maiesties Reuels,' i.e. the second Children of the Queen's Revels who existed between 1610 and 1616. 3 The Hector of Germany, or The Palsgrave , a thoroughly fictional history play, was probably written in 1613, in connection with the marriage of Frederick V, Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate (i.e. a 'Palsgraue'), to Princess Elizabeth of England, and, as the title-page and the Prologue testify, it was acted on the stages of the Red Bull and the Curtain by a group of young amateur players. 4 Josias Harrison handed both plays over for printing to Thomas Creede. Both appeared in quarto 5 and with the date 1615, so that it can be assumed that they were produced at the printing-shop under similar working conditions and within a short time of each other. 6 Cupids Revenge was set by two compositors, a Compositor X and a Compositor Y. The division of their work on the quarto 7 can be determined as follows: Compositor X set the title-page, 48 pages and two half-pages, Compositor Y set 29 pages and two half-pages of Cupids Revenge . The basic spelling tests for the identification of compositors X and Y in Cupids Revenge prove to be equally useful when applied to the quarto of Hector . They enable clear-cut attributions for a majority of its pages, and corollary evidence obtainable from the special word-material of this play (such as variations in its speech-prefixes, e.g. Clynton vs. Clinton , etc.) establishes fully its similar compositorial pattern: Compositor X set the original title-page and 28 pages, Compositor Y set 36 pages and the cancel title-page of The Hector of Germany . While there are irregularities in each case, some of which will call for explanation and interpretation, it seems safe to say that the general pattern represents a procedure of non-simultaneous seriatim composition, with the take-over of one compositor from the other ideally at $3, or the beginning of the second half, of each gathering. Thus, according to what seems to have been their basic work plan, each compositor set the second half of one, followed by the first half of the next sheet. When one finished his stint, his partner was ready to proceed from the fifth page of text of the sheet in hand, having had ample time since ending composition at the bottom of page four of the previous gathering to fulfill the auxiliary duties required of him during the printing process, and to distribute type. Performed in each case by one compositor while the other was setting type, these tasks would not influence the progress of composition and printing of the text. Collaboration was thus apparently aimed at largely cutting out the 'non-productive' phases of compositorial work, allowing only the time of composition itself to count in the compositor:press relationship. It was therefore also limited, so it seems, to sections of a quarto where efficient distribution would directly affect the continuity of composition. At the beginning of a quarto, however, where work presumably started from a full case of type, and at the end, where a case could be allowed to run low, there was no immediate need for distribution, and, therefore, apparently also no need for two compositors. Thus, we find Compositor X alone setting a whole gathering and a half at the beginning of Cupids Revenge , and both X and Y are seen, at the end of Cupids Revenge and Hector , to compose on their own stretches of text considerably longer than the usual two consecutive half-gatherings. But where collaboration was in effect, it allowed for great flexibility. Composing by two consecutive half-gatherings meant, in terms of the printing, a division by half-formes. Two of a compositor's four pages went into the inner, two into the outer forme of a sheet. Consequently, just two pages of wrought-off type at a time would be returned to him for distribution. Theoretically, and perhaps ideally, he would find four pages of type waiting to be distributed when he finished a stint of composition, and he received another four pages and distributed them, too, before beginning a new stint. This ideal situation may, of course, in practice never have occurred. Instead, what was of practical importance was that each two pages of type distributed replenished a compositor's case just sufficiently to allow him, in an emergency, to step in and resume composition early, and at short notice. The compositors were thus not strictly bound to work-units of the size they had set out to compose in — they would have been much more so bound had they originally settled for seriatim composition by sheets, or for setting by formes — but could alternate freely. If run, or improvised, to perfection, their alternation could presumably be made to mesh so smoothly as to equal the continuous setting of one man from a 'bottomless' case. It would, basically, have required no casting-off, but simply the handing over of copy from one compositor to the other at the end of each stint, without a break in the continuity of composition. However, if one compositor happened to be ready to begin his prospective new stint before the other man had quite finished the preceding one, a little bit of ad hoc casting-off would enable him to proceed, thereby for a brief period actually setting simultaneously with his partner. If, on the other hand, he reappeared before his time to make up for a delay, he would, rather, be concerned with setting a relief page or two in his partner's stint. And, since a relief page could be the fourth page in a forme, the basic sequence of seriatim composition by two men was thus, when the need arose, apparently also open to an approximation of the principle of composition by formes. In short: an initial survey of the pattern of compositorial stints in both Cupids Revenge and Hector shows two compositors at work in alternation, according to a system of non-simultaneous seriatim setting of type. The preceding observations indicate that it was a system with great flexibility in technical matters. This will have to be further substantiated, and it remains to be seen just how, as a mode of composition, it may also have been adaptable to the varying nature of printer's copy and thus have had an influence on the texts it produced. The evidence of running-titles shows that both quartos were printed in two skeletons. The running-titles in Hector read 'The Palsgraue' on recto and verso, except for A3, C4 v and D1 which have 'Palsgraue' without the article in what are two, or possibly even three distinct settings. The running-titles in Cupids Revenge read 'Cupids Revenge' on recto and verso throughout, except for 'Kupids Revenge' on C3 and C4 v in the uncorrected state of C(o). While in Cupids Revenge the identification of running-titles and the tracing of the formes through the press is relatively uncomplicated, the running-titles in Hector are at times impossible to re-identify. Among the identifiable ones shifts of position within the skeleton-formes in consecutive printings are so common that one suspects many accidents may have befallen the others, with consequent re-lockings or resettings that prevent recognition. It is, however, possible to determine that, basically, the two skeletons which are found to be established in B(o) /C(i) and in C(o) print the subsequent formes of the quarto in regular alternation. From the initial pattern of running-titles, and from the frequent shifts between compositors in the sequence of composition between C3 and D2 v , an order of printing for the first three sheets of Hector can be reconstructed which explains the late consolidation of two alternating skeleton-formes, and which not only suggests the order of composition of the early text and the pages of preliminary material, but also accounts for the deviation from the usual eight-page length of compositorial stints between C3 and D2 v . From the manuscript of Hector it was certainly a simple matter to determine that the preliminaries, including the Prologue, would occupy the first half of gathering A, and that the text was to begin on A3. Compositor Y started here on his first full stint which took him through B2 v . Compositor X followed with a full stint through C2 v . While X was setting type, Y constructed two skeleton-formes which successively printed B(i) and B(o). Y resumed composition on C3, but he must have seen that he could not for long afford to have four pages of his type tied up in A, so he interrupted his stint, set the dedication for page A2, and imposed A(i). He used the skeleton from B(i) and, needing only two running-titles, he removed the other two. X, after setting C3 v , followed suit in returning to sheet A and composed the play's original title-page and the Prologue, in order to prepare A(o) for the perfecting of A(i). It is possible that Y, before embarking on his four-page stint C4-D1 v , stripped B(o) and placed the three pages of C(i) that had already been composed in its skeleton. For X constructed a separate skeleton-forme for A(o), with two new, and differing, running-titles in positions A3 and A4 v . The printing of A(o) must then have progressed far enough by the time Y had composed D1 v for him to interrupt his typesetting again in order to make C(i) ready for the press. X, meanwhile, set no more than D2 before he, presumably, was called upon to strip A(o) and impose C(o). C(o) contains the running-title from A4 v in position C3, and, in all likelihood, its forme-mate from A3 in position C4 v . The running-title in position C1 is taken from B3 v and is one of the two that were removed when A(i) was imposed in the forme of B(i). The running-title in position C2 v is disturbed in all copies of the quarto and cannot be identified, but it may be the other one that was removed from B(i). Compositor Y, meanwhile, set page D2 v , being the last page of a stint that should have been consecutively his from C3 onwards. Compositor X, although he had twice relieved Y in its course, quite orderly took over at D3, and regular stints of two consecutive half-gatherings resume. The skeleton-formes printing C(i) and C(o), then, are the ones that subsequently alternate in the quarto. The inference about the sequence of composition, imposition, and printing which establishes them draws additional support from the observation that the third of the three original skeleton-formes is demonstrably only used in A(i) and B(i). The two running-titles in common to A(i) and B(i) do not reappear. The skeleton was thus presumably discarded in a state that contained these two running-titles only, and the likely order of the formes it printed was therefore B(i)-A(i). From this assumption, the rest of the argument follows, and it is not improbable that compositors X and Y worked in the manner described through page D2 v of Hector , in the easy alternation and flexible timing that their mode of collaboration permitted. Further aspects of that collaboration will become evident from Cupids Revenge . In Cupids Revenge , the stage at which half-sheet A was printed, cannot be deduced from the available evidence; but otherwise, there is no reason to doubt an order of printing that started regularly at B(i). The two skeleton-formes which in alternation printed the quarto are found established in B(i) (skeleton A, with running-titles I, II, III, IV), and C(o) (skeleton B, with running-titles V, VI, VII, VIII). Skeleton B had been used before to print B(o), but of the three running-titles in evidence there, only no. VI (B2 v →C2 v ) survived into C(o). In skeleton A, running-title no. II (B2→C2) was reset for C(i), but from C(i) and C(o) onwards, the two skeletons move — with a few turnings, but only occasional resettings of running-titles, or shifts in their relative positions — smoothly through all the formes of the quarto but the last four. Of these, skeleton B prints K(o) only, and skeleton A prints K(i), L(i), and L(o), in that order, as L(i) takes all its three running-titles from K(i), whereas L(o) preserves only two of them and uses a reset third one. As long as the skeletons alternate, skeleton A regularly prints inner formes, and skeleton B outer formes, except for an exchange of formes in sheet F. A double reversal of their order therefore took place for sheets F and G, and this may indicate a time lapse in the printing which in each case was sufficient to make both skeleton-formes available at the time of imposition of the first forme of each succeeding sheet. By tracing the order of composition from the beginning of the quarto to sheet G, in stints that, in spite of apparent difficulties incurred by Compositor Y in the course of setting E3-E4 v , mesh smoothly and on two occasions actually overlap, it can be shown that the compositors may at that stage of the printing indeed successively have had both formes of type for sheets F and G available when the press was ready for them. Compositor X set the first full sheet and a half of the play. 8 The shifts at C3 and D3 were regular. Thereafter, Compositor's Y's second stint was due to begin at E3, which is indeed a page of sheet E he set. However, he could hardly have been fully occupied, at least not on work connected with Cupids Revenge , while X was working on D3-E2 v ; for only six pages at the very most (two each from C(i), C(o), and D(i)), though probably less, could during that interval have been returned to him for distribution. Thus, he would have been ready to set again before X had finished the last page or two of his stint. X may have held a part of the copy that contained the beginning of E3, and so it is likely that a beginning for E3 v was determined, and that Y composed E3 v and E4 before reverting to E3. E3 v -E4 are comfortably set, but E3 is exceedingly crammed, and this seems to point not to a simple handing-down of copy, but rather to faulty casting-off as intervening between the stints of compositors X and Y in sheet E. There are signs on E3 not only of desperate shortage of space — two lines of dialogue are set in italics in the margin, without speech-prefixes, and there is no spacing whatsoever before the entry line of scene (II,5) — but even of possible textual corruption, perhaps cuts in the dialogue. 9 E4 v must thereupon have been the last page of sheet E to be set by Y, as is apparent from its relation to F1. E4 v is again crammed, though less so than E3. It prints verse as prose, and has 37, rather than 36, lines to the page. On F1, X reappears, and in effect takes over what would have been the second half of Y's stint through F2 v . Therefore, Y must have been held up in his composition of sheet E, especially in E3 and E4 v , and whatever cause prevented him from continuing into sheet F must have been foreseen, too, so that X got in ahead of him and started setting F1. Y returned at F3 and worked into sheet G, X once more prematurely relieved him for two pages, G1 v and G2, and Y completed sheet G. This irregularity of stints in sheet G may be related to the order of printing. If the press, due perhaps to a delay caused by Y's difficulties over E3-E4 v , was still occupied with sheet E while composition progressed through sheet F, then both formes of sheet F would have been available for imposition into what happened to be a reversed order of skeleton-formes when the press was ready to print sheet F. The pattern of composition in sheet G (reinforced by the pattern of distribution of X's type, where type from F(i)(o) is not distributed until after H4, and before I2 v ) may, by analogy to the compositorial shifts in C3-D2 v of Hector , indicate just where the compositors attended to the make-ready of the formes of sheet F. Again, the composition of G would have been completed by the time the press was ready for this sheet, and the order of the skeleton-formes could be once more reversed. Correspondingly, brief stints of composition once more alternate in sheet H. In addition, compositor X fails to distribute enough type before beginning to set H1; it will be shown that his cases are depleted by the end of page H2. These facts may indicate that efforts were concentrated on getting sheet G through the press, and, as compositor X entered Y's stint to set the single page H4, forme H(i) may have followed at the earliest opportunity. That H4 was set by X for the express purpose of completing H(i) swiftly, can only be surmised. In sheet K, however, there is strong evidence that compositor Y entered X's stint for the length of one page to aid in the early completion of one forme of the sheet. Compositor Y ends his last full stint on Cupids Revenge in the middle of page I2 v . The composition of the remaining 18½ pages of the quarto is left to X, except for page K4 v . Two-skeleton printing, however, continues through sheet K. But it can be shown that skeleton B was abandoned early precisely because the full collaboration between the compositors had effectively ceased after I2 v , and an order of printing in the last two sheets can be determined which resulted in a major disturbance of the text. When Compositor X embarked upon his long final stint from I2 v , line 15, to the end of the play, he did not have the advantage of a full case of type. He had, on the contrary, accumulated a considerable backlog of undistributed type, and, as is evident from the pattern of type-substitutions which will be discussed in greater detail below, he distributed all the wrought-off type available to him at ever shorter intervals: his four pages of sheet H between I4 and I4 v , his two pages of D(o) after K2 and into K3, and his two pages of I(i) before K3 v . I(i) had thus already come off the press, and I(o) was presumably being printed, while the type-setting had advanced no further than K3. Faced with the need to distribute type before setting K3 v , X must have recognized that he by himself would not soon have another forme ready. K(i) was only half set; but of K(o), three pages were in type, and this forme could next go to press if its fourth page, K4 v , was set out of sequence, and ahead of time. For this purpose, compositor Y's assistance was once more secured, and the copy was cast off accordingly. K(o) was ready when I(o), printed in skeleton B, came off the press, and K(o) was imposed in the same skeleton. Skeleton A, after printing I(i), had apparently become immediately designated to print K(i); and it seems as if X, to retrieve his pages from I(i) for distribution, and to make room on his work-bench, had picked I3 v and I4 out of skeleton A and dropped the two pages of K(i) he had finished, K1 v and K2, in their places. For the skeleton turns between I(i) and K(i), and the running-title from I3 v goes to K1 v , that from I4 to K2. But K(o) in skeleton B undoubtedly preceded K(i) through the press, and skeleton B, and thus two-skeleton printing, was thereupon abandoned for the last three formes of the quarto, K(i), L(i), and L(o). This assumption is confirmed by the typographical appearance of the text in X's pages K3 v -K4. A comparative survey of X's and Y's pages in both Cupids Revenge and Hector shows that the pages of X generally accommodate less text and are the more liberal in their spacing. 10 But this distinction does not apply to pages K3 v and K4. Both have 37 lines of text instead of the 36 lines standard in this quarto, and all but the first three lines of K3 v (continuing correct verse from the preceding page) and two-thirds of K4 are set in solid blocks of lines to the full measure. Short exclamations by characters in dialogue are squeezed in where preceding paragraphs carry over only a word or two into their last lines, and even stage directions are not given lines by themselves. A relief to the eye comes only at the bottom of K4, where correct verse lineation resumes with the beginning of scene (V,3). But the entry of (V,3) is preceded by another entry, " Cornets. Cupid from aboue. ", which, in analogy to previous entries of Cupid, should be followed by a speech. Cupids Speech which belongs here is in fact printed on L3 v , following the final Exeunt . of the last scene. It was only by leaving it out of its correct position, therefore, that X could find enough room on K4 for the thirteen lines of text of scene (V,3) that would join correctly with their continuation on K4 v . Thus, K4 v must have been previously set, following a casting-off of copy that was hasty and conspicuously faulty. The text for K4 v must have been determined before X entered on K3 v , for he begins to make his adjustments as soon as line 4 of that page. Therefore, it is also likely that K4 v , in its forme K(o), was going to press early. For, as X discovered the faulty casting-off immediately on resuming composition, yet struggled for two pages to make ends meet, the alternative course of resetting K4 v may not have been open. From the evidence established thus far we conclude that the speed and intensity of production of Cupids Revenge varied appreciably through the sheets of the quarto. Beyond what has been said, any amount of statistical detail could be brought to bear on a strengthening or a modification of these preliminary findings. A survey of type reappearances, for example, would be suited to supplementing them most fully, by minutely tracing each phase of composition, printing and distribution, and would thus also do equal justice to both compositors. Such a survey has not been undertaken. We shall therefore have to forego the closer view of Compositor Y which only it would have given, and shall confine ourselves to tracing the work pattern of X by scrutinizing the type substitution he practiced in I's, P's and L's. If a view of one compositor's work in isolation is to be meaningful, or even at all possible, it must be assumed that each of the two men set from, and distributed into, his own cases. At least one piece of evidence, the occurrence of a tailed italic m in Y's pages only, supports this assumption from the outset. Then, to arrive at standards for subsequent counts, it will have to be decided whether X started out with a full case, and whether his first sheet and a half, pages B1-C2 v , were set with or without intermittent distribution. Here, the early occurrence of type substitutions for upper-case roman P provides the necessary evidence. There are five roman capital P's in sheet B, three in B(i) and two in B(o). In C1, C1 v , and C2 v there is one substitution each by an italic capital P for correct-fount roman, and, in addition, four small-cap roman P's or upper-case roman P's from another fount, in B2 v , and one each in C1 and C1 v , which are clearly also used as substitutes. The occurrence of a substitution as late as C2 v , by which time distribution of the first wrought-off forme of B could theoretically have taken place, suggests that there was no distribution and re-use of type from sheet B before the end of C2 v . This, in turn, implies that X must have set his first long stint of twelve pages from a full case. The one surprise element in these observations is that the case from the outset should have contained no more than five upper-case P's of pica roman no. 6. 11 Subsequent counts in Cupids Revenge , however, and the recurrence of similar conditions in Hector , support this calculation. 12 In his first twelve pages, X set a total of 113 I's (see table). If, before resuming composition at D3, he distributed B(i), he regained 29 I's, and he used 29 I's in D3-D4. As an irregular pattern of intermittent substitution starts at D3 v , line 27, it is likely that the last of the pages of B(i), page B4 with 7 I's, was distributed piece-meal during the composition of D3 v , line 27-D4. Altogether, the substitutions show that more pieces of roman I would have been needed than were supplied by the distribution of B(i). This suggests that the total of 113 I's in pages B1 through C2 v had in fact drained X's supply to the last piece, and therefore constitutes the entire number of capital roman I's his case held. An analysis of the numerical occurrence of correct-fount and wrong-fount I's suggests the following sequence for the progression of composition and distribution in the pages of Compositor X from the beginning of the text at B1 through K4: before distributes gains uses in spare D3 } B1 v , B2, B3 v } 22} 22} D3-D3 v } during D3 v -D4} B4} 7} 7} D3 v -D4} D4 v B2 v -B3 22 19 D4 v 3 E1 B1 7(+3) 10 E1, to line 26 E1 v B4 v , C1 10 10 E1 v , to line 33 E2, line 17 C2 v 18 13 E2, l. 17 thru E2 v 5 F1 C(i) 27 27 F1-F2 5 F2 v E(i) 13(+5) 17 F2 v 1 G1 v E(o) 20 14 G1 v -G2 7 H1 } } {8 H1-H1 v before and during H2} D3 v } 11(+7) { } { H2 1 H4 G(i) 14 11 H4 4 I2 v D4, F(i)(o) 48(+4) 56? I2 v , line 15 -- I4 v , line 14 I4 v , line 26 H1-H2, H4 28 28 I4 v , line 26 -- K1 v , line 8 K2 v D(o) 33 31 K2 v -K3 2 K3 v I(i) 23(+2) 25 K3 v -K4 The initial stages in this reconstructed sequence show composition and distribution in a but slightly precarious balance. Compositor X worked into his second stint D3-E2 v almost the entire supply of I's he successively retrieved from formes B(i), B(o), and C(o), and there are five spare I's in his case when he ends E2 v . As a wrong-fount I does not occur again until the last line of H1, the order of X's subsequent moves can only be hypothesized by assuming a postponement of the distribution of D(o), with 33 I's tied up in pages D3 and D4 v , until some point after completion of sheet H. By evidence from the reappearance of very few pieces of roman P and the absence from the pages of the quarto for a very long time of the four P's tied up in D(o), this hypothesis will presently be substantiated. The counts of I derived from pages F1 to H1, and the peculiar substitution pattern found on pages H1 v -H2, furthermore suggest that forme D(i), too, was left standing longer than might have been expected, and, with the distribution of D3 v , only began to be drawn on during the composition of H1-H2. This leaves formes C(i) and E(i)(o) as sources of supply for the necessary type used in the two stints F1-F2 v and G1 v -G2, and the sequence of their distribution is inferred in a manner that allows for their successive return from the press. Only minimal distribution, or none at all, can have preceded X's initial stint in sheet H. After setting 8 I's, seven of which were left over after G2, he runs out of the sort at the bottom of H1 and sets 16 substitute italic I's through H1 v , and seven more, interspersed by 4+4 correct-fount I's, on H2. There is one solitary correct-fount roman I on H1 v . The total count of roman I's in evidence on pages H1-H2 is just one short of the sum of his spare pieces left over after G2 plus the number he could have retrieved from D3 v . The assumption that it was D3 v he fell back on is strengthened by the appearance of two correct-fount roman P on H1 v , one of which could have come from D3 v , while the other had become available through distribution of E(o) before G1 v and not used on G2, where there is, instead, a substitution. Judging from the substitution pattern, D3 v must have been distributed piecemeal during H1-H2, although the precise course of distribution cannot be determined. If our analysis is correct, there is only one roman I left in X's case at the end of H2. At the same time, the italic L's which are so much in demand for the speech-prefixes in this play are fourteen times out of fifteen substituted by roman L's in pages H1 v and H2. It seems not unwarranted to believe that X was incurring a very acute shortage of type. Yet the beginning of H2 v is free from all substitutions. If Compositor X did set the first fourteen lines of H2 v , as the spelling evidence on the page seems to indicate, he can have done so not from his own, but from Y's cases, until Y was free to work from them in person, from line 15 onwards. The next point of firm orientation is the complete absence of roman I's in K2, preceded by 12(+2) substitutions in K1 v , and another six, flanked by three and six correct-fount I, on I4 v . The number of I's from I4 v , line 26 (last letter) to K1 v is 28 — or exactly the number contained in the pages of sheet H which were set by X from his cases. The interval between the end of H2 and I4 v can be accounted for, albeit with a minor uncertainty in relation to page I2 v . Here, the spelling evidence once more suggests a division of the page between compositors Y and X. If X entered at line 15, 13 and if he set his section of the page from his own case, the number of correct-fount I's he used up to I4 v , line 14, was 56, or four in excess of the number available after a distribution of D4 and F(i)(o). If, rather than taking over at line 15 as is suggested by the typographical change from prose-as-verse to genuine prose setting, he actually entered at line 20 where his own spelling characteristics truly resume, the number of correct-fount I's to be accounted for is still 54, or two more than our counts make available out of the 113 I's which until now have been repeatedly confirmed as the total number of I's X was using. Moreover, the possibility remains that, although divided between compositors, page I2 v was yet composed from only one set of cases, those of Compositor Y, just as page H2 v had been. If so, X would, by returning to his own cases with page I3, indeed have been using six pieces less than his total by the time the substitution of I's begins in page I4 v . As forme I(o) is distributed only after the composition of K4, and as there are no substitutions of I's and P's in sheet L, and those of L's prove unreliable, there is no way by our present method of testing how page I2 v was dealt with. 14 It seems, however, that this uncertainty does not invalidate the subsequent analysis of composition and distribution in pages I4 v , line 26, to K4. All of sheet H is distributed, as suggested, before composition on I4 v is completed, and, although the supply of I's runs out again during K1 v , the cases must otherwise have been full enough to sustain uninterrupted composition to the bottom of K2. Before K2 v , D(o) is — at last — distributed, and of its 33 I's, 31 are immediately in demand on K2 v and K3. To be more precise: the absence of correct-fount P on K2 v , although four P's would have been released from D(o), and the subsequent appearance of two of them on K3, suggests that not all of D(o) was distributed before composition started on K2 v . Rather, I believe that D3 and D4 v were lying ready for distribution side by side on the compositor's work-bench; distributing the type successively on the whole width of the two pages, he got as far down as line 25 on each page before starting to compose K2 v . These 2 x 25, or 50 lines of type would have yielded 9 plus 15, or precisely the 24 I's needed for K2 v . The mixed substitution pattern of I's on K3 would thus be accounted for by a piece-meal distribution of the remainder of the two pages during the composition of K3, and the four P's from D(o) would indeed have been retrieved only during this latter operation, so that none had been available for K2 v , but the two P's on K3 could be set correctly. By distributing I(i) before beginning to struggle with the composition of K3 v -K4, X then gained another 23 I's to the two that were left over at the end of K3. 25 I's are used in K3 v and K4, and the supply is once more drained to the last piece. At this juncture, skeleton B is abandoned. It is now evident that at the end of X's stint in sheet K a considerable amount of distribution would necessarily have to intervene before the composition of pages L1-L3 v could be begun and completed. It is likely, therefore, that X was at this point left to finish the setting of the text at his own pace, and that no further effort was made to turn the entire resources of the shop to pulling the quarto through, as had apparently been attempted before, at least during the production of sheets H to K. Pages L1-L3 v successively accumulate a total of 71 I's, which are easily within the range of Compositor X's case, if fresh supplies were always retrieved in time. This must have been possible, for there are no more substitutions in the last pages. But, consequently, no further statements can be made about stages of distribution and composition in L1-L3 v . The reconstruction of Compositor X's work pattern through Cupids Revenge hinges ultimately on the hypothesis of the delay in distribution of forme D(o). Our analysis will have some claim to representing the true order of events, if within the pattern of substitutions and reappearances of the letter P, proof for this delay can be furnished. It was argued before that X started out with only five roman capital P's in his case, which were used on B1 v (P 1,2 ), B3 v (P 3 ), and B4 v (P 4,5 ). If, according to our earlier assumptions, B(i) was distributed before D3, the two P's in D3 and the one in D3 v were P 1-3 retrieved from B1 v and B3. But, with B4 v according to the same assumptions not distributed earlier than between composition of E1 and E1 v , the two P's appearing on D4 v cannot be P 4,5 . They must therefore be two additional pieces, P 6 (on D4 v , line 29), and P 7 (D4 v , line 32). To prove that this is not mere speculation, two of the copies of Cupids Revenge in the British Museum 15 have been scrutinized closely in an attempt to trace the actual types. It has not been possible to identify beyond doubt each single one of them in its repeated occurrences. But, by good fortune, P 6 is unmistakeable by a characteristic damage to the lower part of its loop. It can be positively stated that, while used twice in Hector ( Hector B4 v and G1 v ), P 6 does not reappear in Cupids Revenge . When, therefore, on distribution of D (o) during the composition of K3, four P's were gained but only two were re-used, P 6 cannot have been one of them. Furthermore, the P in K3, line 30, can with great confidence be identified as P 1 ; it prints first in B1 v , line 7, then in D3, line 27, but nowhere in the interval between D3 and K3. In combination, these observations seem sufficient proof that D(o) was indeed not distributed before K2 v /K3. Of the remaining pieces, P 4 , too, seems sufficiently characteristic to be traced from B4 v , line 21, to E1 v , line 17, to F2 v , line 1, to I2 v , line 35. This would confirm that F (i)(o) were distributed before I2 v , but not earlier, and B4 v was distributed between E1 and E1 v . From the evidence of the reappearance of P 4 and P 5 in E1 and E1 v , the exact point where distribution of B4 v must have been undertaken can in fact be closely determined. If, as said in relation to the shortage of I, B1 was distributed before E1, and B4 v together with C1 before E1 v , no correct-fount P for E1, line 32, would have been available. However, as the one wrong-fount I on E1 occurs in line 26 of that page, the necessity of substitution at this point may have induced Compositor X to relieve immediately the impending shortage of I's and distribute B4 v before even completing composition of E1. By distributing B4 v somewhere between lines 26 and 32 of E1, he would have retrieved P 4 and P 5 , using P 5 on E1 and P 4 on E1 v . 16 No further individual types can be identified and traced. But the general pattern of reappearances and substitutions of the letter P is such that, almost without fail, correct-fount P's reappear in the pages of Compositor X whenever, and as soon as, pages or formes which themselves contained correct-fount P's are supposed to have been distributed. One exception has been mentioned: the P which was regained by distribution of E(o) before G1 v , and could therefore have been used in G2, does in fact not show again until H1 v , where it joins the P which was retrieved from D3 v . The second irregularity in the pattern occurs in K1/K1 v , where there are three correct-fount P, although the preceding distribution of H(i)(o) provided only two. However, an examination shows quite clearly that the two pieces in K1, line 8, and K1 v , line 11, must be the ones retrieved from H1 v ; the latter is followed by one substitution and then the third correct-fount P. This is an identifiable piece, battered and knocked about; it can confidently be called 8 , and it appears nowhere else in X's pages in the quarto. The hypothetical reconstruction of the phases of composition and distribution in the pages of Compositor X in Q1 of Cupids Revenge , which was based on the evidence of type shortages and the substitution pattern of italic I for roman I, has thus been confirmed and proved by a matching pattern of P for P, and by the identification of reappearing single exemplars of upper-case roman P. In conclusion, it must for the sake of completeness be added that the substitution pattern due to shortages of italic L in speech-prefixes is not fully consistent with the work-phases determined in the preceding analysis. However, the patterns are compatible for X's pages in sheets B-G, and in sheet H as far as H2. Thereafter, a consistently correct distribution ought at each stage to have regained sufficient numbers of correct-fount italic L to make all those substitutions unnecessary which do in fact occur in H4, and in sheets I, K, and L, where the speech-prefixes in L - are so relatively few in number. We can account for this inconsistency only by assuming a disproportionate amount of foul-casing in the distribution of speech-prefix type-material. Compositor X in his progression through the quarto, then, is surprisingly often seen to work from very low supplies of type, and even to distribute while composing. An inference of haste and undue pressure is tempting, and at certain times such factors perhaps contributed to setting the pattern for his work. However, they cannot be claimed to govern it, for, basically, there is nothing to be gained by distribution in small installments of a page or less and frequent alternation between composition and distribution, as against distribution by forme or half-forme and composition of correspondingly larger units. If one compares the situations in Cupids Revenge and in Hector , where the absence of type substitution suggests that at no time any acute shortage of type arose, they differ largely in only one respect: in Hector , neither X nor Y ever overreached himself as X did once in Cupids Revenge , when, by uninterruptedly composing the full length of the first twelve pages, he sacrificed from the outset the advantage his full cases had initially given him. After this beginning, what the pattern of type shortages and substitutions reveals may essentially be but a mildly modified 'normal' working process. The lack of corresponding evidence prevents an analysis of Y's work phases for comparison. But the expectation would be that they follow a very similar course, and that Y neither in Cupids Revenge nor in Hector incurs type shortages simply because he never drains his supplies to the same extent as X did in his first stint on Cupids Revenge . His manner of distribution might well be found to be very similar to that observed in X's stints, for it would ultimately be dictated by the system of composition adopted. This system was, of course, only by a certain degree of abstraction recognized as the underlying 'ideal pattern' of collaboration between compositors X and Y — but no more abstraction is required to see that distributing just two pages at a time was basically the habit that X adhered to. Indeed, as a habit it may have been so ingrained that perhaps it never occurred to him to make an early effort at retrieving more wrought-off type than usual, although he had in fact more type standing in the early formes of Cupids Revenge than was warranted within the limits of his total supplies. Thus, when getting into sheets F and G, he did not distribute in order, but turned to his most recent wrought-off type from sheet E. He simply skipped his pages in D and temporarily left them standing until he had no choice but distributing them when only they could help him out of his shortages. Their distribution would, of course, then require additional time, and, moreover, there are signs that Y was not always available to do his expected share of the work on Cupids Revenge . The stretch of the quarto thereby affected is approximately sheets H-K, and here, the factors of 'haste' and 'pressure' can to some extent be supposed to have influenced the work. But, as we have seen, the situation was remedied by a temporary recall of the other compositor, and by a basic change of pace in the final reversion to one-skeleton printing. On the whole, I believe that no strong argument can be advanced for haphazard or unsound compositorial workmanship in Cupids Revenge . This must be emphasized before conclusions are drawn from a comparison with Hector , which appears in so many ways as the superior quarto, and which certainly is a more successful printing job. It has been recorded above that the composition and the printing of Hector are performed in a manner very similar to that observed in Cupids Revenge . The cooperation of the two compositors is slightly more regular than in Cupids Revenge , and two-skeleton printing is in Hector consistent throughout. Beyond that, such irregularities and blemishes of production as have been observed in Cupids Revenge , provide only slight leverage for bibliographical analysis in Hector . Compositor X's setting of Hector , page E4, for example, soon after his previous stint had ended in E2 v , may be another case of rushing the completion of a forme. And again, twice towards the ends of stints of both compositors — in B2 v for Y, and in E2-E2 v for X — there are signs of casting-off for overlapping composition. Among these signs are a few brief prose-settings of verse to save space. But in the entire quarto, there is no major mislineation, except in the last scene which stretches over H4 v , line 13 - I1 v , and which, in the hands of Y who is finishing the quarto, becomes thoroughly garbled in its lining. But the over-all picture is one of an ease of composition and typographical disposition in the pages of Hector which is truly superior to almost anything seen in Cupids Revenge . In conclusion, the marked differences which exist between the quarto of Hector and that of Cupids Revenge may be largely due to a difference in the quality of the manuscripts. In Hector , there is evidence that both compositors are equally capable of giving a page a satisfactory lay-out, of calculating page-units with fair accuracy when the need for casting-off arises, and, above all, of consistently setting correct verse and prose. The copy for Hector which was responsible for these results appears in all respects to have been clear and unambiguous in its textual arrangement. But the copy for Cupids Revenge seems to have had none of that clarity. Both compositors constantly show signs of struggling with the text and lineation. Prose is found to be set as verse, verse as prose, or verse to be mislined, on innumerable occasions. Both compositors apparently have much the same difficulties with the copy, although X is more resourceful and determined to solve them. His pages contain the larger percentage of what must be regarded as correct passages in either verse or prose; thus, for example, after Y has been setting all but the very end of an entire scene, (II, 6), in straightforward prose through pages E3 v -E4 v , X takes over on F1 in midcourse of a speech and ends it in verse. 17 But X does by no means avoid all the pitfalls of the text. He is almost as likely as Y to be thrown off by a half-line at a change in dialogue and garble the lineation of the subsequent verse passage. And in both his and Y's pages, there are, occasionally, very curious sections where what should clearly be prose is split up into irregular lines that have upper-case initial letters, just as if they were verse. Passages of this sort may show a compositor's bewilderment at its highest and reflect his retreat to a line-by-line reproduction of the copy; this, at least, is a possibility suggested by the appearance of a page such as I2 v where X sets prose out of confidence that he is dealing with a prose scene, whereas Y at the top of the page may well be representing the original lining (and, as in the case of the abbreviation 'Gentl:', even some word forms) of his copy. If this were to indicate that Y, for better or for worse, was generally more inclined than X to take the copy at its face value, then, in assuming that he himself did the casting-off necessary to determine the beginning for his page K4 v , one would recognize this casting-off as being not excessively faulty. If from the manuscript he did not gain a clear picture of which proportion of the text for K3 v -K4 should be prose and which verse, the miscalculation would seem to be more or less within the limits of expectation for Compositor Y and his tendency to crowd more text into a page than X generally does. These last few considerations taken together should act as a check on the inclination to accuse Compositor Y of unusual ineptitude in view of his work on Cupids Revenge . Within a larger context, they should be incorporated into the body of observations and conclusions established in this paper to give foundation to a consistent hypothesis about the nature of the copy for Cupids Revenge . To argue such an hypothesis in every detail is inseparable from closest editorial attention to the play. 18 The object of this paper has been a more narrowly cirmcumscribed study of the composition and printing of Cupids Revenge Q1. To complete a full analysis of its compositors, it yet remains to turn the attention to X and Y as their spelling habits reveal them. By again setting off their usage in Cupids Revenge against that in Hector , and in other work where and when the need arises, I hope, in a second article, to consolidate their characteristics of orthography in a range sufficiently wide to allow conclusions to be drawn about copy spellings and, perhaps, even tentative statements to be made about authorial characteristics as they may be seen to survive into a quarto text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The definitive edition of Cupids Revenge is that of Fredson Bowers in the forthcoming second volume of The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , (1966 —) which I have had the opportunity of consulting in proof on completion of my own independent investigations. To Fredson Bowers I am deeply grateful for his advice and guidance during eighteen months of 'bibliographical apprenticeship.' 2 How and why he should have acquired them in 1615 is not documented. The printed versions of both plays, although hardly based on the actual prompt-books, show definite signs of mark-up for the theatre. Harrison's copy of Cupids Revenge , at least, is therefore likely to have originated from the company. (The complex question of copy for Cupids Revenge is exhaustively discussed in Bowers, Textual Introduction, pp. 321 ff.) We know that after the Children of the Queen's Revels had amalgamated first with the Lady Elizabeth's players in 1613 and 1614, and then, in 1615, also with the Prince Charles's Men (see Chambers, ES , II, 60; 244; and especially Bowers, p. 331, for the probable connection of these facts with Harrison's acquisition of the play), it was Philip Henslowe who was their 'manager' and who would therefore have been the likely person for the publisher to deal with in securing his copy. As for Hector , the wording of Smith's dedication of the play to Sir John Swinnerton seems to suggest that the author himself had been anxious to get it printed. It is not improbable that Henslowe, again, may have acted as Smith's agent in his efforts to find a publisher. Smith knew Henslowe, since he had formerly collaborated a good deal on plays for the Admiral's Men. He might in this instance even have tried to interest one or the other of Henslowe's companies in his play. For, as it happens, the Admiral's Men were now the Elector Palatine's Men. Smith, in his dedication, praises the players who gave Hector its world premiere. But, if we are to believe the title-page, he has also written "new Additions"; and what he may really have desired when approaching Henslowe may have been to get the play performed by the professional actors of one or the other of the troupes of those patrons whose marriage he had been inspired to celebrate by writing his less than masterful history play. Perhaps all Henslowe could do for him, however, was to suggest publication. But these guesses cannot be substantiated and are only put forward here in an attempt to probe the possibilities of a common source for Josias Harrison's copies for the two plays which he may well have acquired as a pair, since he also secured the rights for them and published them together. 3 See Chambers, Elizabethan Stage (1923), II, 23; 59-61; Harbage/Schoenbaum, Annals (rev. ed., 1964, and Supplement , 1966); and Bowers, "Textual Introduction", p. 331. 4 See further the "Introduction" to L. W. Payne, Jr. (ed.), The Hector of Germanie . . . , by Wentworth Smith. Publ. of the University of Pennsylvania, Series Philology and Literature, Vol. XI (1906). 5 Cupids Revenge : A 2 B-L 4 (L4 blank); Hector : A-H 4 I 2 (cancel title-leaf printed on I2); Greg, Bibliography , nos. 328 and 329. 6 In "Thomas Creede's Pica Roman", SB , XXIII (1970), 148-153, W. Craig Ferguson asserts that Hector (STC 22871) was set in Thomas Creede's fount no. 6 of pica roman which came into use in his shop in 1613. From the demonstrably close links between the quartos there can be no doubt that the same type was used for Cupids Revenge . 7 The evidence necessary to secure the division is summarized in Bowers, "Textual Introduction", pp. 317-321. 8 Within this stint, the appearance of B3 v is puzzling. X spreads an uncommonly small amount of text over the page, dividing up a prose passage into irregular short lines, some only three or four words long. I do not believe that he proceeded by formes in sheet B, setting B(o) before B(i) as the appearance of B3 v would in that case have it; nor can I detect signs of a cut in the text. But neither is there any other explanation from the analysis of the composition, unless one assumes that for some reason the positions of the Priest's 'Measure' at the bottom of B4, and of the Song beginning B4 v , had been predetermined, with more space left on the preceding page and a half than there was text to fill it. 9 Dialogue could have been left out around lines 8-10, and again around lines 31-32. There is even a slight possibility that Y tampered with the end of X's page E2 v to make room for essential passages of text. At the bottom of E2 v , there are two short speeches by Leontius in succession, both prefixed Leon . This just might indicate a cut to ensure that the page ended with Leontius' necessary exit line, to be followed by Timantius' comment and concluding remarks which head page E3. The second of the Leon . prefixes is punctuated by an inverted period — or by a hadly inking colon; a colon would be a characteristic of Y. Also, the catchword on E2 v does not conform to X's, but rather to Y's styling. 10 This difference is most strikingly evident in the alternative title-pages for Hector . 11 See above, footnote 6. 12 Incidentally, the assumption of separate type-cases for the two compositors is hereby also reinforced; for Y is never beset with a shortage of P's. For example, he uses the letter seven times in his first stint of Hector alone. 13 See argument in Bowers, "Textual Introduction", p. 319 f. 14 A coherent hypothesis from the evidence of I's alone, however, is this: there was no distribution before H1, or none even until the composition of H1 v was completed. Seven I's were left over from G2, the eighth I on H1 and the solitary one on H1 v are additional pieces of inexplicable origin (foul-cased?), raising the total to 115. After the distribution of D3 v before H2, and the setting of H2, X consequently had not one, but three I's to spare, and six, not four, after H4. He did not set his section of H2 from his own cases, but did use his own type in I2 v from line 20 onwards, setting a total of 54 I's (48+6) between I2 v , line 20, and I4 v , line 14. This makes numerical sense, but could override such conflicting evidence as the reappearance of a P from D3 v on H1 v , and especially the typographical change at I2 v , line 15, only by support from incontrovertible proof — which, alas, cannot be ascertained; for this line of argument would lead to a further, and rather tempting, speculation, namely that the typographical and the orthographical shifts on I2 v should perhaps be distinguished in their origin as indicating a change of compositors in line 20, but a new leaf of manuscript in line 15. Admittedly, though, the assumption of such an alteration in the manuscript, occurring as it does in the middle of a scene, would not exactly uncomplicate the over-all hypothesis about the nature of the copy for this play. 15 Shelf-mark 644.d.2 (an incomplete copy, lacking AI-2 ), and C71.d.27. 16 Whether C1 was distributed together with B4 v before the completion of E1, or in a separate operation between E1 and E1 v , cannot of course be determined. 17 Bowers' opinion about the break between E4 v and F1 notwithstanding ("Textual Introduction", p. 328). Bowers differs in his view of the compositors (pp. 324 ff.), and he treats II,6 as a pure prose scene. I believe prose and verse are mixed in II,6. 18 It has, consequently, been most comprehensively and most convincingly put forward in Bowers, "Textual Introduction", pp. 322-331.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Printing Charges: Inference and Evidence by Keith I. D. Maslen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The facts of book production seldom turn out to be as simple as we suppose. We have recently been warned for instance not to infer a 'strict relationship between a particular compositor and a particular press-crew' in respect of a given work, since the practice of printing a number of works at the same time results in unpredictable complexities of work-flow. 1 The lesson drawn by Dr. D. F. McKenzie for the Cambridge University Press in the early eighteenth century holds equally for the Bowyer Press in the 1730's, as the Bowyer ledgers reveal. 2 The danger of supposing 'the existence of more order and regularity' in the printing process than really existed, to adapt Bacon's phrase, is compounded by our habit of going on to make particular deductions from sweeping assumptions. Dr. McKenzie has reminded us of this doubtful logic in a recent searching discussion of bibliographical argument. 3 A further example of the complexity of trade practice in eighteenth-century London printing may be seen in the Bowyers' methods of determining their charge to the customer. This should serve as a warning against recent tendencies to presuppose uniformity of trade practice in this field as well. In a study of William Strahan's printing charges, for instance, Miss Hernlund doubtfully supposes that Strahan had a fixed scale of prices 'available for daily use in written or printed form', which set out the prices per sheet to customers for works in the several formats, sizes of type, and edition quantities. 4 This scale is inferred from ledger entries which in Strahan's early years usually note type size, format, and number printed, but later only the number printed and the price per sheet. Gaps and anomalies in the reconstructed scale are put down to lack of the right kind of evidence. Miss Hernlund does indeed present a range, if not a scale, of prices for different classes of book-work that offers a basis for comparison with charges by other printers, but her attempt to infer an actual scale used by Strahan is of doubtful validity, for several reasons. The first is given by T. C. Hansard who stresses the need to calculate afresh the charge for each work, not 'two works in fifty . . . [being] exactly fellows' ( Typographia , 1825, pp. 791-2). A cut-and-dried scale of charges for book-work to customers would have been little use to Strahan. What Strahan no doubt did have was a scale or range of piece-rates for composition and press-work which he used to determine his final charge per sheet. Certainly for both Samuel Richardson and the Bowyers charges to customers were largely a function of productive wages. The point is made by the younger Bowyer in a letter to Jonathan Toup probably written in 1760: 'I have almost composed a Sheet . . . I cannot fix the Price, till I have seen the Sheet in Print, &amp; agreed with the Workmen'. 5 Richardson has explained his own practice, chiefly in the well-known letter to William Blackstone of 10 February 1756. 6 The basic importance in the printing-trade of piecerate scales for composition and press-work is well recognized, even though it is not clear how far back in time they go. In 1749, long before the first London scale of prices for composition of 1785, Richardson had particularised the customary rates (Philip, pp. 1246). It was these if anything that the master had to keep by him. Once piece-rates for a particular job were decided, the price per sheet to the customers could be found by applying what Richardson calls the 'common 3ds which a Printer reckons on his Charges', i.e. by adding half as much again to the sum of productive wages, reckoning correction or reading as one sixth of composition, so that the master received for himself one-third of the total bill. 7 Unfortunately, the Strahan ledgers reveal neither the rates for piece-work, nor how Strahan used these to arrive at his charge per sheet. We might of course assume that Strahan, like Richardson and the Bowyers, used the 'rule of thirds', so that it should be possible to infer the prices paid for composition and press-work from the final charge per sheet. Some support for the results would come from prices current at the Cambridge University Press early in the century, or at the Bowyer Press during the 1730s, as shown by Dr. McKenzie in his study of the Cambridge University Press (1966) and his 'Printers of the mind' (1969), Appendix II. Evidence that Bowyer commonly followed the rule of thirds to make up his price per sheet in book-work comes from his dispute with his partner James Emonson in 1757. 8 Once this is known it is often possible to infer acceptable rates for composition and press-work in examples where only the charge per sheet or even just the total cost of printing is known. For instance, the total cost of printing 1000 copies of Voltaire's History of Charles XII , 1755, in 12°, is noted at £21.0.0d for 15 sheets, which works out at £1.8s.od a sheet. Supposing presswork to have cost 1s.2d a token (of 250 perfected sheets), the most common rate quoted by various authorities, then the total per sheet for the 1000 copies works out exactly at 12s. for composing, 2s. for reading, 4 x 1s.2d for press-work, and 9s.4d for Bowyer's share. Confirmation of this guess-work is provided by a manuscript note that composition was in fact 12s. However, these little calculations do not always work out neatly, and then one suspects that other hidden factors have influenced the result, such as say the need to quote a more than usually competitive price to the customer. Not once does the charge per sheet quoted by Dr. McKenzie for ten works in Appendix II (g) of 'Printers of the mind' break down theoretically according to the rule of thirds, although these are all cases where the cost of composition and press-work is known. When for item 1 a theoretical 23s. 7½d by the rule of thirds is found charged at 24s., then apparently Bowyer has merely rounded off this calculation to the nearest shilling; but in items 2 and 7 the charge of 18s. ought by the rule of thirds to have been 16s.6d and 19s. 3d respectively. Elsewhere Dr. McKenzie has called it 'a simple matter' by applying the rule of thirds to calculate rates for composition and press-work for the London Magazine . 9 Noting that the price per sheet increases 6s. per 500 copies from 1500 to 8000, and allowing 2s. of this for the master's third, Dr. McKenzie manages to split up the price per sheet for 4000 copies as follows: composition per sheet 16s., correction at one-sixth 2s.8d, press-work at 8s. per 1000 £1.12.0d, plus the master's third £1.5.4d, totalling £3.16.0d. The computation works out very neatly, but both composition and press-work are suspiciously high. For press-work something less than 4s.8d for long runs is suggested by Richardson writing in 1756, and this is the maximum at the Bowyer Press for book-work (Philip, p. 42). I think it more likely that Ackers took a fatter share than the rule of thirds would allow for printing the London Magazine , in which he was a proprietor, something closer to the one hundred per cent on productive wages charged by Bowyer for printing the Votes of the House of Commons . 10 To do this Ackers may have used a different method of computing the price per sheet. This is a method occasionally noted in the Bowyer ledgers for runs of 1500 or more, according to which Ackers could have taken 40s. per sheet as his basic price for 1000 copies and thereafter charged 6s. a ream for press-work, at more than double the wages paid out to the press-men. The result may be the same, but the method of attaining it quite different, an alternative method to the rule of thirds. An example of a calculation by this method was found 'confusing' by J. D. Fleeman when announcing the discovery of a set of Bowyer ledgers in the library of the Grolier Club, New York. 11 The item relates to Richardson's Pamela in small pica 12° entered 2 March (?) 1741: '2 Sh. No. 3000, at 26s &amp; 5s P er R 46s'. This should be read as 26s. a sheet for the first 1000 copies and 5s. per ream thereafter, amounting to 46s. a sheet. Another example is printed without comment as item 8 in Appendix II (g) of Dr. McKenzie's 'Printers of the mind'. In the Bowyer ledgers Grolier Club 19471 and 19474, which are consecutive customer account books covering some sixty years, I have found fifteen or so references to this method from 1717 to 1746. The only obvious common factor to the works involved is an edition quantity of 1500 or more, the great majority of works printed by the Bowyers being of 1000 copies or under. Otherwise the works are mostly in 8° and 12°, varying in length, though more often very short, printed for a variety of publishers, and only four times shared with other printers. There is reason to suspect the use of this formula on other occasions when only the price per sheet is given. For instance, of a set of seven duodecimo plays mostly by Nathaniel Lee, entered for W. Feales and Partners on 11 February 1734, the first separately printed play Sophonisba is noted at '30s p er Sht for ye first Thousd &amp; 5s p er R for ye rest, viz. 47s: p er Sheet' (Grolier 19471, fo. 115 v ). For the subsequent plays in quantities ranging from 2000-3000 only the total price per sheet is given. The same practice is found for a group of ten plays for Jacob Tonson entered during 1734-5: 10,000 copies of the first play in the series, the London Prodigal in long primer 12°, are charged at '30s for ye 1000 &amp; 5s p er R', but for the remaining plays only the total amount of the bill is noted, sometimes with the price per sheet. For instance, 10,000 of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra are charged at £6.0.0d (Grolier 19471, fo. 89 v ). How often was charge by the ream over 1000 copies reckoned in the very many instances where only the price per sheet or total bill is noted, as in Strahan's ledgers? No definite answer can be given, but the use of this formula for some thirty years indicates that it was no idiosyncratic experiment. The bibliographer must in future test for multiple hypotheses. Few entries relate to the period after the death of the elder Bowyer in 1737, but this may mean no more than that the son, for all his college education, was a very much less careful bookkeeper than his father. The practice of charging by the ream over 1000 copies is closer to nineteenth century practice as described by T. C. Hansard in Typographia (1825), p. 793. Hansard explains that after about 1810 it became the practice to charge the whole impression by ream work, a 'greater proportion' being laid upon the sum paid to the workmen for expenses and profit, whereas formerly the exact sum paid for working the first 1000 had been lumped with the cost of composition and correction and thirds added on the whole — unfortunately Hansard does not make it clear what happened above 1000. The increased charge for press-work amounting to more than double the cost of wages is justified by Hansard on account of the higher cost of type and the modern objection to worn type. The similar charge by Bowyer of 5s. per ream, also more than double the payment to the press, could also be justified on the grounds that as the size of the run grew, so did overheads for ink, wear and tear on type and presses and the costs of warehousing. The charge by the ream after the first 1000 copies gave a higher return to the printer than the rule of thirds because of the greater margin taken on press-work. This may be why the prices per sheet of items 4 and 8 listed by Dr. McKenzie in Appendix II (g), previously mentioned, do not yield to analysis by the rule of thirds. Yet the two methods are related, both depending on the same elements of productive wages. This relationship can be seen from the entry for the tragedy Philotas by Philip Frowde (Grolier 19471, fo. 72 v ): 1730[/1] Mr. Millar Dr Feb. 18 For printing Philotas in 2 Sh. &amp; ½ No. 2500 &amp; 6 fine Pica 8vo at 20s p er Sht for ye first Thousand &amp;5s p er R for ye Remainder 4 7 6 Corrections in ye Two first half Sheets 0 5 0 ---- ---- ---- 4 12 6 From Grolier 19472 under 20 February 1730/1 it appears that composition of four half-sheets cost 8s. a sheet, and 2500 copies at press cost 5s. a forme, i.e. 10s. a sheet. By the rule of thirds 1000 copies would cost 8s. for composition, 1s.4d for correction, 4s. at press, and 65.8d for Bowyer, making £1.0.0d per sheet, the very price quoted by Bowyer. In this instance at least the price for the first 1000 copies was evidently made up in the familiar way by the rule of thirds, and one suspects that this was the usual practice. The charge per ream above 1000 copies at 5s. is 2½ times the cost of press-work. Since this figure is all but constant for the whole period in question, whereas presswork tends to vary slightly from one work to another, the rate for ream work should be recognized as a customary charge. It was no doubt originally reached by doubling the cost of press-work, commonly no higher than 1s.2d a token for the first 500 copies, i.e. 2s.4d a ream, and then by rounding this off to the nearest shilling. Other examples work out rather less neatly. For instance, A defence of the measures of the present administration , for J. Peele, 1731, in 8°, listed by Dr McKenzie in the aforementioned Appendix II (g), is charged at 16s. for the first 1000 and 5s. per ream, composition is 5s.6d a sheet, and press-work for 1000 copies averaged 4s.4d. By the rule of thirds the price for 1000 copies should have been 16s.1½d, not 16s. Bowyer has apparently abated his price per sheet, just as sometimes he knocks a few shillings off the final account once payment is virtually complete. A charge per ream is commonly found in Bowyer's jobbing work, applying especially to his regular printing of the duodecimo Sternhold and Hopkins Psalms , and various almanacs, for the Company of Stationers, and to such short pieces as Edward Synge's Answer to all the excuses and pretences which men ordinarily make for their not coming to the Holy Communion , of which the Bowyers printed a dozen or so editions from 1717 to 1764. The distinct difference is that in jobbing work the charge per ream applies from the first. Again a common rate per ream is 5s, as for single sheets of the almanacs Culpepper and Rose , but sheet B of the Lady's Almanac with its geometrical cuts is 6s., and the title sheet of Poor Robin in red and black 9s. per ream, taking into account the double working. Synge's Answer to all the excuses is charged on 28 June 1712 at 5s. per ream, but later editions at 6s. Volume III of the Iliad translated by Pope, 2500 copies in 12° for Bernard Lintot, entered 1 September 1719, is quoted at '48s. p er Sh.viz. 30s the first Thousand, &amp; 6s. p er R the rest', volume I being entered six weeks later simply at 48s. a sheet. Strahan followed a very similar method for large runs of jobbing work, if I interpret Miss Hernlund correctly (p. 95). As I have explained elsewhere, Bowyer uses a variety of the charge per ream for the Votes of the House of Commons , this time to allow himself a margin of about one hundred per cent on productive wages, in accordance with the custom that Parliamentary work should be charged double on account of the night work and the need to keep hands in readiness. This investigation has revealed an alternative method of charging to the rule of thirds, which has been too easily accepted as the all-sufficient principle of charging for eighteenth-century book-work. It has been shown that some charges do not work out exactly by either method, perhaps because on occasions the master suited his regular charges to particular needs, as all businessmen do. Sometimes a price was evidently agreed upon in advance. Bowyer printed 3500 copies for Richard Sare of part of Abel Boyer's Compleat French Master , 1714, at 25s. per sheet 'p er agreemt' (Grolier 19471, fo. 82). For many years thereafter, although the same price structure is kept, no agreement is mentioned, nor was there need for a fresh one. Agreements are noted for a wide variety of works, some calling for large edition quantities, shared printing, or difficult setting — it is not easy to see exactly why. 12 The last word is best left to Richardson, who told Blackstone in 1756, referring evidently to the whole subject of prices, that he generally fixed his prices by 'Practice, by Example, by Custom, and by Inspection' (Philip, p. 41). Richardson is drawing attention to the various ways of determining prices: by following an established system, by following a particular precedent, by following traditional trade practice, and by appraisement of the work in question. No doubt he would have allowed a further consideration: by agreement or consultation, with the workmen in the case of piece-rates for composition and press-work, and with the customer for rates per sheet.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">One find winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh . . . walking round and round in a circle . . . . "Hallo!" said Piglet, "what are you doing?" "Hunting," said Pooh. "Hunting what?" . . . . "That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What? . . . . I shall have to wait until I catch up with it." . . . . "Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a-a-a Woozle?" A. A. Milne ______________________________________________________________________ That the text of the Bronte letters published by Clement Shorter, 1 and after him by Wise and Symington in the Shakespeare Head Brontë of 1932 2 is imperfect and incomplete has been pointed out often enough. 3 But Brontë Hunters still rely, unhappily, upon these unreliable words. Perhaps, therefore, a demonstration may be acceptable of the serious persistence of Woozles in these scholarly woods. One of the most quoted, most pillaged letters that Charlotte ever wrote is that of 4 September 1848, which she sent to Mary Taylor in far-away New Zealand, and which Mary cherished greatly. It is the only letter of Charlotte's which she kept, of all their rich correspondence, and she lent it to Mrs Gaskell for the Life in 1856. 4 In this letter Charlotte recreated with obvious enjoyment for her one wholly congenial friend the drama of the visit which she and Anne had paid to London two months earlier to prove to their publishers their separate authorial identities. The passage of time since July, and Mary's distance in space, provided a perspective within which Charlotte could recreate and focus the whole extraordinary affair. She writes exceptionally well, her lively colloquial prose speeding along on the wings of commas and dashes. There are memorable vignettes, glancing personal comments, and telling points of detail. The historic confrontation of Brontë-Smith at 65 Cornhill in that "little back room . . . only large enough to hold 3 chairs and a desk" is brought to life in dialogue, followed by a breathless narrative of all that thereupon was said and done, before the exhausted pair returned to the haven of their moors. Yet in neither substance nor tone is the version published by the Shorter-Wise-Symington complex the true text of what Charlotte wrote. Comparison with the letter itself, which has been in the Library of the University of Manchester for sixty years, reveals omissions, alterations and additions, the final result being so gross a travesty that it is difficult to credit. Shorter is the villain of the piece, though Wise and Symington are equally culpable in following blindly in his footsteps. Shorter first printed the letter in 1900 in the Haworth edition of Mrs Gaskell's Life , in his footnote to the modified extract which she had inserted in her account of the visit (pp. 361-71). Shorter's introductory remarks suggest to the unsuspecting reader that, while Mrs Gaskell's is a "skilful paraphrase," his offering is the true original. Yet it is here, at this very point, that Shorter produces a mangled text of his own, adding to it, indeed, a detail which Mrs Gaskell had supplied from another source, and which Charlotte had not herself included. 5 Shorter "normalized" all the punctuation, thus obliterating Charlotte's spontaneity, and in one instance at least, altering her meaning. 6 Far worse than this destruction of the communicative tone are the alterations and omissions, all unacknowledged. These latter range from single words — "gentlemanly," for instance, describing Smith — to passages of considerable length. The longest omission is of one and a half particularly lively pages, some 35 lines of Charlotte's writing, covering that interview in the "little back room" and Smith's "loquacious" reaction. Next to this in length is the omission of 13½ lines describing the bewilderment of Smith's womenfolk on penetrating to the Chapter Coffee House that Sunday afternoon to take these two "insignificant spinsters" home to Bayswater to dinner. Occasionally Shorter inserts his own drab summary covering his omission, or otherwise smooths over a too obvious excision. Besides these sins of omission, there are those of deliberate commission, when the facts are tampered with. "At last we were shown up to Mr Smith" is how Shorter renders that moment at 65 Cornhill. The facts are quite different. As they sat waiting by the busy shop-counter, "at last somebody came up," wrote Charlotte, "and said dubiously 'Did you wish to see me, Madam?'" Then she continued "We were both hurried from the shop into a little back room — ceiled with a great skylight — and only large enough to hold 3 chairs and a desk—." One altered detail in particular epitomises the whole sorry business, the "snowstorm," for this has misled Brontë biographers ever since — such of them, that is (they are the majority), who have not consulted either Mrs Gaskell or Charlotte Brontë herself. On the receipt at Haworth that 7 July 1848 of Smith and Elder's letter "all in alarm, suspicion and wrath" (another phrase Shorter omitted), she and Anne, Charlotte wrote, "packed up a small box, sent it down to Keighley — set out ourselves after tea — walked through a thunderstorm to the station, got to Leeds and whirled up by the Night train to London—" Thunderstorm : the word is perfectly clear, and Mrs Gaskell used it. But in 1900 Shorter turned it into a snowstorm , and Brontë biographers ever since have, like the page in the carol, trodden in their master's steps "where the snow hath dinted." Snow or thunder , then becomes an Instant-Test for scholarly scrupulosity. Of some fifteen books in the last thirty years, only Fannie Ratchford passes this test, while Phyllis Bentley, Margaret Lane and Margaret Crompton, who rely upon Mrs Gaskell at the point of the storm, reveal by their wording about the Brontës being "shown up to Mr Smith" that they have accepted the Shorter-Wise-Symington versions of the letter itself. 7 Romantic Brontë Hunters, of course, cannot resist that snow, and develop it with relish. It is so superbly appropriate as the weather for their quarry to be out in, even in midsummer. More soberly, Winifred Gérin, in her Charlotte Brontë (1967), ponders on the unseasonableness of snow in July, but concludes that "at those altitudes" such a storm would not be surprising (p. 360). Perhaps not. Where, and when, does this sort of thing stop? Woozle after woozle appears with every scholarly turn around the spinney. Pooh-Bear, at least, came to the point of acknowledging that he had been "Foolish and Deluded." The moral is, that we desperately need a correct edition of the Brontë letters, and then, perhaps, all copies of Shorter, Wise and Symington throughout the land should be committed to a public bonfire, preferably during a THUNDER storm (one set to be retained, as a bibliographical memento). An annotated literal transcription of Charlotte's letter is appended, by permission of the Library of the University of Manchester. Shorter's innumerable variations in punctuation, capitalization, spelling and other such matters have not been noted, except where the meaning is affected. Charlotte's impetuous dashes have, however, been retained. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Haworth. Septr. 4th 1848. Dear Polly I write to you a great many more letters than you write to me— though whether they all reach you or not, Heaven knows. I daresay you will not be without a certain desire to know how our affairs get on — I will give you therefore a notion as briefly as may be. 5 "Acton Bell" has published another book — it is in 3 vols but I do not like it quite as well as "Agnes Grey" the subject not being such as the author had pleasure in handling — it has been praised by some reviews and blamed by others — as yet only £25 have been realized for the copyright — and as "Acton Bell's" publisher is a shuffling scamp — I 10 expect no more. About 2 months since, I had a letter from my publishers, Smith &amp; Elder — saying that "Jane Eyre" had had a great run in America — and a publisher there had consequently bid high for the first sheets of the next work by "Currer Bell" which they had promised to let him have. 15 Presently after came a second missive from Smith &amp; Elder — all in alarm, suspicion ["s" del ] and wrath — their American correspondent had written to them complaining that the first sheets of a new work by "Currer Bell" had been already received and not by their house but by a rival publisher — and asking the meaning of such false play — it inclosed an 20 extract from a letter from Mr Newby (A &amp; E. Bell's publisher) affirming that to the best of his belief " "Jane Eyre" "Wuthering Heights" — Agnes Grey" — and the "Tenant of Wildfell Hall" (the new work) were all the production of one writer" This was a lie, as Newby had been told repeatedly that they were 25 the productions of 3 different authors — but the fact was he wanted to make a dishonest move in the game — to make the Public &amp; "the Trade" believe that he had got hold of "Currer Bell" &amp; thus cheat Smith &amp; Elder by securing the American publishers' bid. The upshot of it was that on the very day I received Smith &amp; Elder's 30 letter — Anne &amp; I packed up a small box, sent it down to Keighley — set out ourselves after tea — walked through a thunderstorm to the station, got to Leeds and whirled up by the Night train to London — with the view of proving our separate identity to Smith &amp; Elder and confronting Newby with his lie — 35 We arrived at the Chapter Coffee House — (our old place Polly — we did not well know where else to go) about eight o'clock in the morning — We washed ourselves — had some breakfast — sat a few minutes and then set of [sic] in queer, inward excitement, to 65. Cornhill. Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Williams knew we were coming they had never seen 40 us — they did not know whether we were men or women — but had always written to us as men. We found 65 — to be a large bookseller's shop in a street almost as bustling as the Strand — we went in — walked up to the counter — there were a great many young men &amp; lads here and there — I said to the first 45 I could accost — "May I see Mr Smith —?" he hesitated, looked a little surprised — but went to fetch him — We sat down and waited awhile — looking a [sic] some books on the counter — publications of theirs well known to us — of many of which they had sent us copies as presents. At last somebody came up and said dubiously "Did you wish to see me, 50 Madam?" "Is it Mr Smith?" I said looking up through my spectacles at a young, tall, gentlemanly man "It is." I then put his own letter into his hand directed to "Currer Bell." He looked at it — then at me — again — yet again. I laughed at his queer perplexity — A recognition took place — I gave my real name — "Miss Brontë —" We were both hurried from the 55 shop into a little back room — ceiled with a great skylight and only large enough to hold 3 chairs and a desk — and there explanations were rapidly gone into — Mr Newby being anathematized, I fear with undue vehemence. Smith hurried out and returned quickly with one whom he introduced as Mr Williams — a pale, mild, stooping man of fifty — very much like a 60 faded Tom Dixon — Another recognition — a long, nervous shaking of hands — then followed talk — talk — talk — Mr Williams being silent — Mr Smith loquacious — "Allow me to introduce you to my mother &amp; sisters — How long do you stay in London? You must make the most of the time — to-night you 65 must go to the Italian opera — you must see the Exhibition — Mr Thackeray would be pleased to see you — If Mr Lewes knew "Currer Bell" was in town — he would have to be shut up — I will ask them both to dinner at my house etc." I stopped his projects and discourse by a grave explanation — that though I should very much like to see both Mr Lewes and still 70 more Mr Thackeray — we were as resolved as ever to preserve our incognito — We had only confessed ourselves to our publisher — in order to do away with the inconveniences that had arisen from our too well preserved mystery — to all the rest of the world we must be "gentlemen" as heretofore. 75 Williams understood me directly — Smith comprehended by slower degrees — he did not like the quiet plan — he would have liked some excitement, eclat etc. He then urged us to meet a literary party incognito — he would introduce us a [sic] "country cousins" The desire to see some of the person- 80 ages whose names he mentioned — kindled in me very strongly — but when I found in further examination that he could not venture to ask such men as Thackeray etc. at a short notice, without giving them a hint as to whom they were to meet, I declined even this — I felt it would have ended in our being made a show of — a thing I have ever resolved to avoid. 85 Then he said we must come and stay at his house — but we were not prepared for a long stay &amp; declined this also — as we took leave — he told us he should bring his sisters to call on us that evening — We returned to our Inn — and I paid for the excitement of the interview by a thundering head-ache &amp; harrassing [sic] sickness — towards evening as I got no 90 ["t" del ] better &amp; expected the Smiths to call — I took a strong dose of sal volatile — it roused me a little — still I was in grievous bodily case when they were announced — they came in two elegant, young ladies in full dress — prepared for the Opera — Smith himself in evening costume white gloves etc. a distinguished, handsome fellow enough — We had by no means 95 understood that it was settled that we were to go to the Opera — and were not ready — Moreover we had no fine, elegant dresses either with us or in the world. However on brief rumination, I though [sic] it would be wise to make no objections — I put my head-ache in my pocket — we attired ourselves in the plain — high - made, country garments we possessed 100 — and went with them to their carriage — where we found Williams likewise in full dress. They must have thought us queer, quizzical looking beings — especially me with my spectacles — I smiled inwardly at the contrast which must have been apparent between me and Mr Smith as I walked with him up the crimson carpeted staircase of the Opera 105 House and stood amongst a brilliant throng at the box-door which was not yet open. Fine ladies &amp; gentlemen glanced at us with a slight, graceful superciliousness quite warranted by the circumstances — Still I felt pleasurably excited — in spite of head-ache sickness &amp; conscious clownishness, and I saw Anne was calm and gentle which she always is — 110 The Performance was Rosini's [sic] opera of the "Barber of Seville —" very brilliant though I fancy there are things I should like better — We got home after one o'clock — We had never been in bed the night before — had been in constant excitement for 24 hours — you may imagine we were tired. 115 The next day — (Sunday) Mr Williams came early to take us to church — he was so quiet but so sincere in his attentions — one could not but have a most friendly leaning towards him — he has a nervous hesitation in speech and a difficulty in finding appropriate language in which to express himself — which throws him into the background in conversation — 120 but I had been his correspondent — and therefore knew with what intelligence he could write — so that I was not in danger of underrating him. In the afternoon — Mr Smith came in his carriage with his Mother — ["and took" del ] to take us to his house to dine — I should mention by the way that neither his mother nor his sisters knew who we were — and their 125 strange perplexity would have been ludicrous if one had dared to laugh — To be brought down to a part of the city into whose obscure, narrow streets they said they had never penetrated before — to an old, dark strange-looking Inn — to take up in their fine carriage a couple of odd-looking country-women — to see their elegant, handsome son &amp; brother 130 treating with scrupulous politeness these insignificant spinsters must have puzzled them thoroughly Mr Smith's residence is at Bayswater, 6 miles from Cornhill — a very fine place — the rooms — the drawing-room especially looked splendid to us. There was no company — only his mother his two grown up sisters — and his brother a lad of 12-13 and a 135 little sister — the youngest of the family — very like himself — they are all dark-eyed — dark-haired and have clear &amp; pale faces — the Mother is a portly, handsome woman of her age — and all the children more or less well-looking — one of the daughters decidedly pretty — except that the expression of her countenance — is not equal to the beauty of her 140 features. We had a fine dinner — which neither Anne nor I had appetite to eat — and were glad when it was over — I always feel under awkward constraint at table. Dining-out would be a hideous bore to me. Mr Smith made himself very pleasant — he is a firm, intelligent man of business though so young — bent on getting on — and I think desirous 145 to make his way by fair, honourable means — he is enterprising — but likewise cool &amp; cautious. Mr Smith is practical man — I wish Mr Williams were more so — but he is altogether of the contemplative, theorizing order — Mr Williams lives too much in abstractions — On Monday we went to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy — 150 the National Gallery, dined again at Mr Smith's — then went home with Mr Williams to tea — and saw his ["comparatively" inserted above] humble but neat residence and his fine family of eight children — his wife was ill. A daughter of Leigh Hunts' [sic] was there — she sung some little Italian airs which she had picked up amongst the peasantry in Tuscany, in a 155 manner that charmed me — For herself she was a rattling good-natured personage enough — On Tuesday morning we left London — laden with books Mr Smith had given us — and got safely home. A more jaded wretch than I looked when I returned, it would be difficult to conceive — I was thin when I 160 went but was meagre indeed when I returned, my face looked grey &amp; very old — with strange, deep lines plough [sic] in it — my eyes stared unnaturally — I was weak and yet restless.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX Mrs Gaskell treated this letter as raw material for her dramatic reconstruction of the experience, but towards the end introduced what purported to be the actual text: Charlotte says, in an account which she gives to her friend of this visit to London, describing the entrance of her party into the Opera House: — "Fine ladies and gentlement glanced at us, we stood by the box-door, which was not yet opened, with a slight, graceful superciliousness, quite warranted by the circumstances. Still I felt pleasurably excited in spite of headache, sickness, and conscious clownishness; and I saw Anne was calm and gentle, which she always is. The performance was Rossini's "Barber of Seville," — very brilliant, though I fancy there are things I should like better. We got home after one o'clock. We had never been in bed the night before; had been in constant excitement for twenty-four hours; you may imagine we were tired. The next day, Sunday, Mr Williams came early to take us to church; and in the afternoon Mr Smith and his mother fetched us in a carriage, and took us to his house to dine. On Monday we went to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, the National Gallery, dined again at Mr Smith's, and then went home to tea with Mr Williams at his house. On Tuesday morning, we left London, laden with books Mr Smith had given us, and got safely home. A more jaded wretch than I looked, it would be difficult to conceive. I was thin when I went, but I was meagre indeed when I returned, my face looking grey and very old, with strange deep lines ploughed in it — my eyes stared unnaturally. I was weak and yet restless. In a while, however, these bad effects of excitement went off, and I regained my normal condition. The Life of Charlotte Brontë (1857), II, pp. 69-70. To this extract, Shorter in 1900 appended the following note: Mrs Gaskell made use of a letter addressed to Mary Taylor in her account of this visit to London, but the letter has many characteristic touches which make it not the least valuable of the hitherto unpublished material. It is interesting also to compare it with Mrs Gaskell's skilful paraphrase: To Miss Mary Taylor "Haworth: September 4, 1848. "Dear Polly — I write you . . . etc. These words imply that the text which then follows in his footnote is the full and correct text of the original letter.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">William Gilmore Simms and The Family Companion by Robert A. Rees and Marjorie Griffin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the 1840's William Gilmore Simms was the South's most celebrated author and had vast experience as an editor and contributor to Southern periodicals. 1 He was probably the best qualified person in the United States to speak on Southern literature and Southern periodicals, and he gave this pessimistic view of them for publication in the Magnolia : I have had so much experience, either as an editor or as a contributor, in the making of Southern Magazines, and know so thoroughly their history, and the inevitable event, that my conviction of the almost certain fate which awaits them, inspires me with a feeling, very like disgust, when I am told of any new experiment of this kind in contemplation. 2 But Simms was caught between the hard facts of his experience and his persistent hopes for Southern periodicals. Within a year of his letters to the Magnolia , he was editing that magazine, and, as it began to fail, he moved on to assist the Southern Quarterly Review . His justification, as he said to B. F. Perry, was "simply that we may have at least an organ among ourselves to which we may turn when it becomes necessary to express Southern feelings and opinions" ( Letters , I, 370). It is not surprising, therefore, that when Mrs. Sarah Lawrence (Drew) Griffin of Macon, Georgia, wrote to Simms during the winter of 1840-41 asking for his support in her projected literary venture, The Family Companion and Ladies' Mirror , 3 his response was ambivalent. Mrs. Griffin and her husband, Benjamin F. Griffin, although originally from New England, had lived in Georgia since 1835. Mr. Griffin was a successful printer and Mrs. Griffin had authored a collection of tales for children and co-authored a series of school readers. Their youth (in 1841 he was thirty-three and she was twenty-nine) and earlier successes probably made the venture with the Companion the high point of optimism and ambition in their related careers. Simms's first letter to Mrs. Griffin — now missing — probably contained the same sentiments as his letters to the Magnolia . She was apparently offended, for in his letter of June 8, 1841, he apologizes for being "a somewhat rude, blunt man," and, with typical Southern graciousness, accepts the blame for the misunderstanding. He explains the reason for his candor: "If in the case of young beginners, however, they [his views] produce an extra degree of caution, and lessen to a certain extent, that wild and sanguine confidence, which in our country ruins so many thousand, my purpose will be answered, and I shall be satisfied." But Simms was encouraging as well: "I wish you god speed, and will try to do what I can to promote your successes. . . . That you will do well, &amp; prosper, I not only sincerely wish, but sincerely believe." Mrs. Griffin sent Simms an advance copy of the first (October, 1841) issue of the Companion in early September, apparently in an attempt to get his reaction. In his reply the day following receipt of the magazine, he praised her efforts: "You have done wonders. In fineness of paper, neatness of appearance, general propriety and completeness, your work will bear free comparison with the best of our periodicals." He comments on the articles and poems in the issue and generally praises the quality and variety of the literature and her editorial ability. Perhaps her contentious reaction to his earlier letter had caused Simms to be less candid with her than he might otherwise have been, for in a letter to his good friend James Lawson, for whom he had just ordered subscriptions to the Companion and the Magnolia , Simms says, "I trust that these will amuse &amp; interest you. They contain some good things though scarcely a fair sample of what might be done in the South with good Editorial management" ( Letters , I, 283). On the other hand, this comment to Lawson may represent his sensitivity to Northern critics, for his correspondence with Mrs. Griffin indicates that he was genuinely impressed with the Companion . For almost a year Simms maintained a serious interest in the Companion . During the early months of 1842, however, his direct connection with the Companion came to an end. At this time Simms was trying to finish his first important novel, Beauchampe , and may have been too busy to respond to further requests for editorial assistance and advice. Another and more important reason, perhaps, is that early in 1842 Simms began to have closer ties with the Magnolia . In April of that year he assumed its editorship, a position which he held until June, 1843. In the letter to the Magnolia quoted earlier, Simms said, "When I sit down to write for a Southern periodical — which I do only as a professional duty — I do so under the enfeebling conviction that my labors and those of the editor are taken in vain; — that the work will be little read, seldom paid for, and will finally, and after no very long period of spasmodic struggle, sink into that gloomy receptacle of the 'lost and abused things of earth,' which, I suspect, by this time possesses its very sufficient share of Southern periodical literature" ( Letters , I, 200). Simms's presentiment about Southern periodicals came to pass for the Companion . In May, 1842, he wrote to Lawson that the Companion would "probably go down at the end of the year." In August he was more definite, indicating that it would "probably stop on the 1st January" ( Letters , I, 310, 322). The signs of decline were all too evident to Simms. A short August number was followed by an announcement in the September issue that there would be a reduction in price, "which would put it in the power of every one to become a subscriber." Apparently the subscriptions were not immediately forthcoming, however, for no numbers were issued in October and November. The December, 1842, and January, 1843, numbers appeared on schedule, but the February number was late. A note in the Editorial Department apologized for the delay and announced that there would be no March issue and that the April and May issues would be combined. To counter what must have been the unmistakable evidence of decline, Mrs. Griffin stated optimistically, "Our readers may rest assured, that the Companion will appear with undeviating punctuality in [the] future; and we trust with renewed interest" ( Companion , III, 200). No further numbers of the Companion appeared. The failure of the Companion was due to many factors. To begin with, it was established at a time when competition was great. Frank Luther Mott suggests that approximately 500 periodicals (not counting newspapers) were begun between 1825 and 1850. Many of thesedid not survive more than a few months. 4 In his introduction to James Russell Lowell's The Pioneer , Sculley Bradley points out that "in 1843 . . . the world of the American magazine was characterized by rapid expansion, ruthless competition, high mortality, and cheap devices to win the largest number of subscribers at whatever cost to artistic integrity." 5 There were several personal factors involved in the failure of the Companion . A dispute developed between the Griffins and William Tappan Thompson in the late spring of 1842. Thompson had joined the Griffins in the early part of 1842, in a merger prompted by their need for editorial assistance and Thompson's need for funds with which to salvage his Augusta Mirror from financial collapse. The union lasted only a few months, however. According to Bertram Flanders, "The new editor had not been working long at his duties before friction developed between him and his associates. First of all, Thompson, in ill health at the time, was irked by his arduous duties. Griffin wanted him to perform the labors of a journeyman in the printing establishment. Thompson was editor, contributor, and general superintendent of the office. He read proof sheets, made up the pages of the magazine, and directed and assisted with the job work. He had no control over what went into the Companion or what was left out of it." 6 The trouble came to a head when Thompson suggested that a series of sketches begun in an earlier issue and entitled "Cousin Betsey's Letters on Matters and Things" be discontinued, unaware that Mrs. Griffin was the author. Thompson quit the Companion and was soon editing the Southern Miscellany . According to Flanders, "Both Griffin and Thompson aired their views of the controversy in the papers of the day, and strong words were used on both sides. . . . The Southern Miscellany published several of Thompson's 'Letters to the Public,' in one of which Mrs. Griffin was called 'a vain vulgar woman'" ( Early Georgia Magazines , p. 65). It also seems reasonable to assume that the magazine's failure was due in part to the fact that Mrs. Griffin could not supply the time and effort needed. Her seventh child was born in February, 1842, or February, 1843; either date would indicate an inevitable diminution in her professional efforts. The Griffins remained in or near Macon until 1856, when they removed to Brunswick, Georgia. Four years later, they moved to Manhattan, Kansas. Mr. Griffin remained in printing and publication activities until his death in 1887. Mrs. Griffin is described as already an invalid when the family moved to Kansas. She had borne fourteen children of whom only five survived. Family tradition has it that in later years disaster or tragedy drew no more from her than the words, "I have no more tears." She died in 1872. 7 Bertram Flanders offers this estimate of Mrs. Griffin's success: " The Family Companion stands at the very top of Georgia ante-bellum monthlies, sharing honors with the Magnolia (Savannah) and the Orion (Penfield). Mrs. Sarah Lawrence Griffin, though not the best judge in the world of reading matter, in some way managed to get contributions that were among the best to be found in Southern periodicals." 8 Although Simms's interest in the Companion was short-lived, his influence on it was substantial. He was generous with advice, encouragement, contributions, and editorial assistance. Judging from the suggestions she employed, it seems clear that Mrs. Griffin respected Simms's editorial experience and his knowledge of Southern periodicals. Although several of Simms's letters to Mrs. Griffin are missing, those which are presented here provide a full picture of an interesting relationship. They also add a chapter to our understanding of Simms and his relationship to Southern periodicals. * The style followed in presenting these letters is similar to that employed in the collected Letters . The letters are printed verbatim — including misspellings, faulty punctuation, and Simms's own erratic capitalization — except for inadvertently repeated words and crossed-out words which have been omitted. Significant inadvertent omissions have been supplied in square brackets. Indecipherable words are represented by dashes in angle brackets, with a dash for each word. Conjectural readings are also supplied in angle brackets. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter I Charleston, S.C. June 8. [1841] 9 My Dear Madame Your last favor has been lying by me unanswered because of my Sheer physical inability to bring myself to the labors of the desk. My little family, myself not exempt, have all been suffering from Sickness, not the less annoying because it was not actually dangerous. Even now I am suffering from disordered digestion the certain consequence of our warm climate &amp; my Sedentary pursuits. I trust this statement of facts will do away with any impression of neglect which may have been induced by my delay to answer. I gather from Something in the tone of your last letter that I must have said Something in one of mine which was obnoxious to misconstruction: Let me in this place assure you of my innocence of intention if Such is the case. I am a very unconventional Sort of person; very ardent in my temperament, very earnest in my object; express myself usually in the first words that come uppermost; write usually as I talk; and as the world goes, am accounted a somewhat rude, blunt man. An unamiable character, enough, but one which, perhaps, is not without its virtues, which, in my case, I must leave to the charity of my friends to find out for themselves. Do me the kindness, my dear Madame, to take for granted that I have Every disposition to promote your wishes, and to do justice to your claims, as well as Lady as Litterateur. Do not be angry at my inadvertencies; believe only that an habitually earnest — perhaps, dictatorial habit of speech, has beguiled me into a too great plainness of utterance, in which I betray my own bluntness of character, without meaning to offend the sensibilities of yours. I trust I am forgiven for all my unwitting offences. In giving utterance to my opinions on Magazines &amp; Southern Literature, I was prompted by a desire to comply with your request. It is not improbable that I exaggerate the difficulties in your way. I trust Sincerely you will find it so. But in thinking as I do, I was bound to speak Sincerely. The easiest task in the world is to answer as the world would wish to be answered. My choice is not the Easiest, and my opinions, therefore, are not likely to be often the most popular. If in the Case of young beginners, however, they produce an extra degree of caution, and lessen to a certain extent, that wild and sanguine confidence, which in our country ruins so many thousand, my purpose will be answered, and I shall be satisfied. I have no doubt that you know better than I do, the Sort of material which will better please the great body of readers — Nay, with Some qualification, I am willing to agree with you; but it does not need that we should attempt a discussion which involves So many controversial points. Enough that I wish you god speed, and will try to do what I can to promote your Successes. The notice of the 'Companion' which I sent you, contained in The Charleston Courier was only in part written by myself. 10 The portions so Eulogistic of the Novel, were interpolated by the Editor, who is a very warm friend of Mine, and, I believe, conscientiously thinks of the work all that he said. I need not again assure you, — in spite of your very flattering remarks in opposition — that, on this Subject, I cannot help differing in toto from both of you. I wish it were what you believe it, as well for your Sakes as for mine. I regret the mistake about the Subject of the plate, but it will not be injurious, and is not of vital moment. 11 Am I to understand that the Sketches are from your pencil? Are you able to exclaim with the Italian — "Anch' io Son pittore!" If so, I should like you to send me some of the illustrative sketches you have made, for though no manipulator , I am yet, professedly, a wonderful dealer in grouping &amp; landscape. I enclose you a batch of Sonnets, 12 which I really think among the best of these things which I have Ever done. I am very much afraid that I shall be able to do nothing in Season of the Sort you wish. My Engagements with my publishers are very pressing. I am pledged for two large works to be finished this Summer; 13 and to coerce the imagination is to destroy it. The task of inventing against the desire is unfavorable to the author and would be productive of discreditable performances. If I feel the impulse I will obey it and you shall have the fruits. But my daily tasks must now be resumed; and I have written So many &lt;small&gt; stories that I should really be at a loss for a topic. If the scheme, the groundwork, the agents were suggested to me, — if I had any clue to them, there would perhaps be little difficulty. Recollect, Even Shakespeare, with all his invention, Stole all his plots — his stories ready made to his hands. I fancied when I sent you Oakatibbe, 14 that I was actually send.g. you one of my best labors — not as a Story perhaps, but as comprising a very bold, original philosophical argument, on a Subject, of all others, the most vital to the interests and feelings of the South. The grand questions with regard to the Indian &amp; negro races, I sought to discuss in a Style equally fanciful &amp; philosophic, and I am pleased to think that there is a gradual &amp; not slow rising of the public Mind in our Country to the Comprehension of these Subjects.— 15 You are right in the determination to pursue your way as Editress, alone. I did not Suppose that Neal was associated with you. 16 I only though that you might not know his proverbial indiscretion of character. I am pleased to perceive the solemnity with which you address yourself to your task. Without a stern resoluteness nothing of any value has Ever yet been done. That you will do well, &amp; prosper, I not only Sincerely wish, but Sincerely believe — always with the one reservation, however, against any hopes of extravagant Success in the South, unless you do what has never yet [been] done by Southern Editors — Secure a large, various host of able contributors, depend upon no amateur literature, let your work contend on Equal grounds, So far as type, paper, press work &amp; illustrations are concerned, with Northern contemporaries, get good agents, and keep your collector (who shall be honest at the Same time) constantly at his tasks. Do not fear, now that your hand is in. Remember what Spenser writes over all the doors but one — "Be bold, be bold, be bold!" Over only one door he writes — "Be not too bold." Touching the articles on Southern Literature, I must say but one word at present. 17 I must wait a little while before I can answer you. I will Send the volume of Poems to Mr. Hart. 18 In conclusion, while I still say you have undertaken a very Serious labor, one that requires great faith, constancy and diligence, I see nothing which Should make you faint or fear. There is nothing in your tasks which a noble woman, energetic, believing, having a deep strong heart, a fervent Soul and a good mind, may not compass. You will, I think, if anybody. Respectfully and faithfully, Yr friend W. G. Simms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 2 Charleston, Sep. 8. [1841] 19 &gt; My dear Madam Your first number was received yesterday, &amp; I must confess quite Surpasses my expectations. You have done wonders. In fineness of paper, neatness of appearance, general propriety and Completeness, your work will bear free comparison with the best of our periodicals. Your letter press too is very good. John Neal's verses are rather less mad than usual &amp; Contain some forcible &amp; fine lines. 20 Those by Wilde, 21 though not equal to some others of his pieces, are graceful &amp; sensible. The paper on Classical Literature by our young Countryman Holmes 22 shows reading and is very well expressed. Perhaps it shows too much reading. The notes are quite unnecessary &amp; cumber the narrative, besides giving an air of pedantry to the paper which lessens the reader's interest as well in the writer as in the Subject. If they are to be put in, I would recommend that you throw them at the foot of the columns, and not suffer them to be massed like so many hyeroglyphics, to themselves. The article on Education, though very &lt;sensible&gt; &amp; Showing thought is too long. 23 The commonplaces of this Subject should be rejected in Such essays. Of the tales I cannot well judge having only glanced at a few paragraphs. Your own Editorials (Qu?) betray unnecessary timidity. I suspect you feel alarmed, but you really need not. You give an ample quality of matter, and in this you have the advantage of Several of your Competitors. I do not think your artists have been quite Successful with the plate. 24 The choice of the subject was very unfortunate. The scene itself, now that my taste is more mature, should never have been written. At all Events it is one of those Scenes of which the artists Could make little or nothing. You recollect, also, that I warned you that the Partisan I considered the most faulty and the least successful of my books. You were pleased to think differently, but without impressing me with your own more favorable estimate. How you can give a plate at all, is another subject of wonder. — I intended that my Sonnets should be published as a series. I wrote you or meant to write you, that I should regularly give you a contribution of verse for each Number. Let me beg that you will put the remaining Sonnets in a batch together 25 — unless they usurp a place that might be better occupied. — I note your offer for prizes. Perhaps, it would be advisable to define to your readers what you require for a prose tale, of what length &amp;c. A small prize for the best essay of two or three pages might also be of good results. Of course you have the privilege of publishing such as you please of the unsuccessful articles. Mr. Hart has a subscriber for you, for whom you must send a copy. He, Mr. H., suggests you should send a show copy of the work to him. He is an excellent man and will make a good agent. I do not know what your calculations are. I trust you may not deceive yourself. I suppose you See the Magnolia. I think it not possible that such a work can be successful. It wants variety . 26 Yours has Enough; but subscriptions in the South are bad things, and Correspondents not to be relied on. Your chance is better as your book is larger, better looking, and promises to compete on Equal ground with the Northern journals of the same class. In the number of pages you beat both the N. Y. Companion and Godey's Lady's Book. I have just bought one of your first books for children 27 I think it very good. It is not improbable that your Class Books for the South will take the lead of all others. — 28 At this moment I am a&lt;laborer&gt; at the mill. I have Some literary engagements with Northern publishers which Scarcely leave me time for sleep. I have written you this scrawl, with tremulous fingers, after penning 20 pages foolscap. In the early part of the Season Sickness, night-watching &amp; finally death in my family, 29 kept me from performing my tasks. It will be November before I am free. This will excuse me to you for not having complied with your request for a Story. — By the way, when you set up my Indian Sketch, 30 perhaps it will be safer to send me a proof. Send me 2. — by different mails; so that, should one fail the other may be sure. In conclusion, let me say, again — you have done wonders. Your work does equal credit to the taste of the publisher and the talents of the Editor. I have little or no fault to find. What I have, is already expressed. I put up a copy of my poems for you some months ago, but it remains still with Hart waiting for an opportunity to be sent. Can you suggest one? With Sincere wishes for your Success.

If I might presume so far, I should concur entirely with your husband in assuming that you do want nothing but practice and very little more of that, to edit your Companion with satisfactory Success. At all Events do not weaken yourself by a premature distrust of your own ability. One thing alone should make you confident. There is precious little ability in any editorial department, in any of the established monthlies . What is the Messenger's, the Knickerbocker's, which are considered among the best? The one is a blank, the other a petit maitre in the literary image of a monstrous petty circle. 32 In the Competition, at least, which you are to meet, there is nothing to alarm you. But I trust you will work out your editorials without regard to the doings of your bretheren. The standards of composition should be intrinsic. The ideal of one's own mind should be the highest &amp; the best. I should prefer that the Sonnets should go together. They were meant as a sort of family group. I am very sorry that Oakatibbe does not please you, the more particularly as just now I am over head &amp; ears in labor and can do nothing out of the &lt;brain&gt;. You are aware that the story was meant to be Subservient to the argument. Perhaps a brief note to this effect would be of Service. 33 At all Events you promised me a proof of it. Do let me have two impressions sent by different mails — So that if one sh'd fail, we should still be tolerably sure of the other. Touching the price of these contributions I can say nothing. I leave this matter entirely to yourself for the present. I should be better pleased that you should determine their value for yourself. This will depend on the degree of patronage you receive. At all Events I am willing that it should be so, in respect to the Sonnets &amp; Oakatibbe. We can have a more decided understanding in the Event of further contributions. I do not know that I shall be free to do anything for a month, unless it be to correct some occasional Copies of verse which are already by me. Pledges of performance made a year ago, and interrupted by the Sickness &amp; death in my family, are now pressing upon me. I write daily, an average from 15 to 22 pages of foolscap. Hard work this, &amp; grievously against the Spirit. I trust to be free by November &amp; to continue tolerably free during the winter. The paper of Mr. Curtis on Sacred Poetry 34 is very well written. The Ins &amp; Outs very spirited — very well done. Perhaps a little over done — but Still lively &amp; stirring. Who is the author? — I can not guess. 35 I repeat that your book is singularly creditable, — not as a first number merely. I do not doubt that you will Succeed in making a deserving &amp; valuable miscellany — of your recompenses I say nothing. Time will show. You give perhaps too much matter, but you know best. — I regret to hear that you have been sick, but the bracing airs of October are already with us, and you cannot help but do well now. You have my Sincere wishes for your restoration to health, with the Success of your literary &amp; all other pursuits. Very respectfully [Y]r obt Sevt &amp;c W. G. Simms P. S. You request a very spirited article for No. 3? When will that number appear? I know not what leisure will be left me, and can therefore promise nothing. But one thing I may say — I regard the writing of Small Stories as a grievous task. These things are done by every body. I have become So arbitrary in these matters, that I write only in obedience to my humours. I prefer a spirited essay or Review — perhaps a Sketch mingling philosophy &amp; humour, — as for example, my article in Godey's Lady's Book for Sep. — "The Philosophy of the Omnibus." 36 The toil of inventing a tale of 20 pages is about as great as that of inventing it for 2 vols. I do not think you will Ever want for Stories. Our magazine writers are Spinning them day &amp; night. They are the Staple. You will rather want the &lt;—&gt; weights by which they are to be balanced — kept down — kept from being too etherial &amp; flying away with the 'Companion.' You must give me the privilege accorded me elsewhere, of writing according to the movements of my own mind. I shall then write more confidently, and I trust more successfully. Yr obt sevt. W. G. S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 4 [Charleston, September 28, 1841] 37 My dear Madame: My new work is not yet published, though I suppose it will be very shortly. I have not a Sheet or passage of it in my possession, and by the time you could receive them from Phila. I suspect the whole work would be in the hands of the public. I should have no sort of reluctance to provide you with the sheets, were I able. I send by Mr. Hart's bundle to Mr. Griffin a copy of my Poems. I am in possession of a few copies which I should like to dispose of, as I happened to be originally interested in their Sale. Do you suppose that Macon would furnish a market to a small extent. Pray, oblige me by making this inquiry of your husband to whom they may be sent if the prospect of selling them shall seem fair to him. For my own part I have no faith in our taste for any of the Fine arts. I send you by this mail, a copy of the Charleston Courier of this day which contains a notice of the "Companion." 38 Our papers are chiefly business sheets, do not deal much in Literary Criticism and perhaps exercise a very small influence over the opinions of our people. You are already in possession of my opinions on the subject of periodical Literature and its chances of success in the South. Your State betrays a more active character, and a more ambitious spirit, in Literary matters than any of its Southern Sisters, and this may tend to falsify my predictions and disperse my fears. At all Events, whatever I may do incidentally in promoting the success of your journal, shall be done. But individually I go but Seldom into Society, and my time is really so much tasked, that I am prevented doing what I would, for yourself &amp; other literary friends, in the shape of an occasional notice in the public prints. I trust shortly to be relieved from this pressure, when, if a kind word from me will be of service, your work shall have it. — The writer of the Pacolette papers is not a Mr. Porter, but "Col. Henry of Spartanburg." 39 I really forget his Christian name &amp; address, but will Endeavor to procure &amp; send them to you. Possibly, a communication addressed simply as above will find him out. You should secure the contributions of Dr. Wm. H. Simmons of St. Augustine, 40 a gentleman who writes a very excellent article in Prose &amp; verse, though a very villainous scrawl. Your Printer will be very apt to regard it as Tony Lumpkin regarded the pothooks of his cousin. He is the author of an account of the Seminole Indians, and of "Onea" one of the most beautiful fragments of Southern poetry which I can now lay my hands on. He may also have in his possession some of the inedited M.S.S. of his brother who is now Treasurer of the Republic of Texas — Mr. James W. Simmons, the author of "The Exile's Return" and sundry other volumes of prose &amp; verse. No doubt you would be able to secure a valuable Contributor in W. H. S. and he might prompt his brother ultimately to give you a series of Texan sketches to which task he is very Competent. My History of South Carolina, 41 has now been published about a year. It is very generally adopted in our Schools and will probably become in time the Class Book throughout the State. I am now meditating a Second &amp; Stereotype Edition, and would be glad to supply Mr. Griffin with any number for his series on very favorable terms. For the copyright of the work, my price is $3,000. I had commenced taking notes for a History of Georgia, on a similar plan, but laid it aside under the pressure of other labors. 42 I will probably finish it this winter, and should be pleased to find a Purchaser for it in Mr. Griffin. It would not be so copious a work as that of South Carolina. Should Mr. G. be so pleased I should like to treat with him for two abridged histories of Carolina &amp; Georgia. These, however, it appears to me should be separate. We in South Carolina are under the impression that there is some little jealousies toward us, in some sections of your State, which operate unfavorably to both Countries. It is one important work before you as Editress to smoothe down these ruffling prejudices, and inspire the people of both regions with a Sense of the necessity of harmonious action as the only means of securing a common fame and a prolonged existence. To recur — I should be pleased to have proposals from Mr. G. for Either one or both of these Histories. — I shall be very well pleased to receive the series of your Publications. 43 I have two daughters, the one 12, the other 2 years old, to whom they will be valuable. — With much respect, I am, Madam, Yr very obt Servant W. G. Simms P. S. I can provide Mr. Griffin with a few copies of three of my works, which I suspect have never been offered for sale in Macon — viz: Carl Werner &amp; Other Tales, 2 vols. Southern Passages &amp; Pictures, 1 — and Atlantis— (pamphlet) 44 The sale of these would promote my interests in Some small degree. Respectfully W. G. S. Mrs. S. L. Griffin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 5 Charleston, Oct. 14 [1841] 45 My Dear Madame, Do send your work to "James Lawson, Esq, New York, ["] 46 and credit him with his subscription for one year, which amt. you will please charge to me. Mr. Lawson, by the way, is a Gentleman of Letters who writes both prose &amp; verse with ability, and you would find him a valuable acquisition could you Secure his assistance. He writes for the Knickerbocker &amp; the South. Lit Messenger, and was the author of the Biography of Bryant. 47 I reviewed his writings in the latter work sometime last year. 48 May I hope to hear from Mr. G. shortly on the subjects of my last letter. I should like to treat with him for an Edition of 1500 Copies of a School History of Georgia. On the first Novem. my address will be "Midway, Barnwell District, South Carolina.—" I send you a vol. of Poems in a bundle which Hart puts up for you today. Very Respectfully W. G. Simms Mrs. S. L. Griffin. Did you get the Charleston papers I sent you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 6 Woodlands. near Midway P. O. South Carolina Nov. 3. [1841] 49 Mrs. S. L. Griffin My Dear Madam. You see by this I have changed my abode for the Season. Jack Frost gives us carte blanche (almost literally) and we are once more among the "woods and braes of bonny" Edisto. Perhaps, this change has Somewhat delayed the progress of your proofsheet; the first part of which only reached me last evening. I have corrected it and return it by this day's mail. You refer to Some portions of your last which I left unanswered. The omission was surely accidental. Indisposition &amp; the singular pressure of my literary tasks, may have rendered me more than usually obtuse and unobserving. May I trespass upon you so far as to request that you will readvise me of any topic which I have failed to notice, — as just now amidst the confusion by which I am Surrounded, it will not be easy for me to lay hands upon the letter to which you allude. Your last letter dated Oct. 2 did not reach me until Nov. It is Endorsed, as brought by private hand, but at the Same time postmarked at Macon, Oct. 20.(?) Did I mention to you that one or two of your previous letters, Sent by private hand, were postmarked to me, a month after, from N. York? I see favorable notices of your work in Several of the Northern papers. I have no Sort of doubt that you will make a work highly deserving of both praise &amp; profit. May they always go together. I give the rest of my letter to Mr. Griffin. Very respectfully, Yr obt Sevt. W. G. Simms</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 7 [November 3, 1841] 50 Mr. B. F. Griffin, Sir My suggestion on the subject of my History of South Carolina 51 was in anticipation of a new stereotype Edition of that work which I am about to prepare. Since writing to you on the subject I have opened a Sort of treaty with Mr. Hart, Book Seller of Charleston, who, being in the city, in the way of trade, appears better calculated than myself to attend to the publication of Such a work. I have requested him to treat with You on the Subject. — I have ordered that a certain small supply of copies of Carl Werner, Southern Passages, Atalantis, and the Defense of Slavery, 52 should be sent to you on Sale. The remaining copies are few, and I have counselled them not to burden your shelves unnecessarily. Please advise me what number of these works you may receive. — We very much want a Southern Publishing House in our country, and a Publisher of any courage &amp; tact must do well. Our public ought to be provided with Educational books at home, which Should do justice to the fame of our people, and conserve the character of our Institutions. They are, I think, just becoming aware of this necessity, but the cursed Parley Books , 53 which are vile &amp; injurious humbugs, Should be written down. I am not wedded to the Northern Publishers, and Should freely give my Strength &amp; Succor to any enterprising Gentleman at home who would launch fairly into the Stream. I spoke a few days ago in Charleston to Mr. Tefft 54 of Savannah, and Suggested the propriety of getting up a series of Southern biography after the manner of Spark's. 55 I suggested to him that the State might be brought to co-operate in this object, in the creation of County School libraries, as is now done in N. Y. Mass. N. J. &amp;c. &amp;c. If the Histc. Society of Savannah would take it up, &amp; your Legislature would Second the plan, I suspect that not only Nor &amp; South Caro, but that Virginia &amp; Alabama, Mississippi &amp; Louisiana, would follow Suit. A moderate appropriation, from Each of these States for a certain number of copies would make a permanent foundation. I should be willing and partially prepared to begin with a Life of Marion, one of Sumter, and one of Greene — &amp;c. 56 This would be a good subject for the Editorial pen of Mrs. Griffin. The Histy of Georgia I have determined to decline, as I find Dr. Stevens busy upon a similar work. 57 I have &lt;not seen&gt; the copy of your Botany which you speak of in your letter. 58 Very respectfully Yr obt Sevt. W. G. Simms Carl Werner retails in Charleston for $2.00. South Passages for $1.00 atalantis 50/100 and the Defence of Slavery for 50/100. I suppose they Should Command the Same prices in Macon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 8 Charleston, July 24 [1842] 59 My dear Sir. In making out my account and drawing upon you, I entirely forgot to give you credit for the subscription of Mr. Lawson 60 (not Hall) of New York. But I will send an article to Mrs. Griffin which will Square our obligations. 61 I deducted one half of the difference of exchanges, however, as amounting to something like Six dollars. I had directed an exchange with the Companion before receiving your letter, and by this time, I suppose that Mrs. G. must be in receipt of the July number of the Magnolia. A notice of her School Books was prepared but excluded from our July number by the press of matter which had been lying some time on hand. I am in hopes that Mr. Binger will treat with you for the Companion. Say to Mrs. G. that I should really be well pleased to have her a &lt;resident&gt; of Charleston. I do not see that the injustice of her contemporaries is any evil, since it will have the effect of Stimulating her exertion to disprove their disaparagements, and babble their hostility. 62 If wrong indues her with the proper strength and courage it will prove a blessing rather than an injury. As for the Knickerbocker &amp; some of its kindred works, as I happen to know them well, I know how to despise Them. I am glad that Mrs. G. is sufficiently bold to see, the truth, even through that thick veil of Veneration, which, in the South, our people are too apt to cast over the real character of what is distant. Here we venerate any thing that is not known. By a joint &amp; corresponding action, we may soon strip these miserable Jays of their borrowed plumage. — On the subject of the work "Beauchampe" 63 I should much prefer just now to say nothing. It and its Companions are imputed to me, and in such cases I neither deny nor admit. It will give me no sort of concern whether they impute it to me or not, in whatever terms; — my rule is simply, not, myself, to give them any authority which they might use, for doing either. Mrs. G— will not only easily understand me, but my reasons, in this matter. Say to her that the Magnolia shall always be sent her — that I have an unfeigned respect for her talents — &amp; congratulate her Sincerely on what she has done, &amp; upon her increasing courage. Her article on Campbell was well done. 64 I shall be really happy to know her better. — I fancy that you &amp; Pendleton 65 had best say nothing to each other. You seem both too bitter &amp; too hostile to concur in any arrangement. Mr. Binger is a man of plain business habits, much moderation &amp; good Sense — very strict in what he undertakes &amp; very Cautious in all money matters. He tells me that your charge for your list is an extravagant one. On this subject, as I really know nothing, I pretend to no opinion. With best respects to your lady &amp; good wishes, I am, (hastily) Your obt. servant W G Simms Mr. B. F. Griffin</field>

Mott quotes the New-York Mirror as giving the average life of periodicals in 1828 as six months. Although Mott feels this estimate is too low, his own figure of two years is also clearly a guess. 5 The Pioneer , A Literary Magazine Edited by James Russell Lowell (1947), p. vi. 6 Early Georgia Magazines (1944), pp. 64-65. 7 An extensive letter collection of the Griffins was preserved by descendants and is presently being studied for the first time. Some seventy of the letters are chiefly of biographical and historical interest; approximately eighty pertain directly to the Companion . The letters in the latter group originated from the following named persons (with the number of letters indicated after each name): William Cullen Bryant, 1; William Alexander Carruthers, 3; Robert M. Charlton, 2; George Washington Crawford, 1; Emma C. Embury, 2; Rufus Dawes, 1; Caroline Howard Gilman, 1; Hannah Flagg Gould, 1; Charles Julius Hadermann, 1; James Edward Henry, 2; Caroline Lee Hentz, 3; George Frederick Holmes, 1; William G.

Rockwell, 1; William Sanders, 1; Frederick William Sheldon, 1; Elizabeth Oakes Prince Smith, 1; Anne Sophia Stephens, 1; Henry Theodore Tuckerman, 1; E. G. Walker, 1; Hardy Vickers Wooten, 2. Many of these are letters declining to contribute, but there are also instances where several letters were exchanged. Most notable are the 16 lengthy letters from John Neal, which are being prepared for separate publication. 8 Early Georgia Magazines , p. 68. Flanders also compares the Companion favorably with one of the most popular periodicals of the time: "The reading matter of the periodical is not inferior to the etchings, which compare favorably with those in Godey's" (p. 63). 9 Besides the general tone which indicates that the first number of the Companion had not yet appeared, this letter is dated by Simms's references to (1) a notice in the Charleston Courier (see note 10, below), (2) his story, "Oakatibbe" (which appeared in the November and December, 1841, issues), (3) his sonnets (one of which appeared in the October, 1841, issue), and (4) the matter of the plate (see note 11, below). 10 The review of the March, 1841, issue of The Ladies' Companion included the following praise of Simms's The Kinsman : "Mr. Simms already stands so high in the estimation of the reading public, that any commendation of ours is almost nugatory, yet we cannot refrain from expressing our conviction that the Kinsman is, in many respects, superior to his preceding productions. So full is it of thrilling incidents, and powerful character, it is difficult to select any one particular part for especial praise[;] we will venture, however, to say that the combat of the brothers is compeer to that of Rhoderic Dhu and Fitzjames, in the Lady of the Lake, while many other descriptions and situations are equal to those of any of our best living writers of fiction." (Charleston Courier , XXXIX [March 30, 1841], 2). 11 The Editorial Department for October, 1841, explains the matter: "Our plate for this number is not what we intended it should be. The volume and page of the Partisan was designated from which the artist was to make the sketch, but from some inadvertance, the wrong volume was taken, which changed the entire character of the plate. "We now have two beautiful sketches in the hands of the engravers, which will be ready in due season for the subsequent numbers" (I, 64). Apparently the sketch in question was prepared for the anticipated spring, 1841, publication of the first issue. 12 One of these was published in the first number of the Companion (I, [1841], 9). All eight, including a repetition of No. I, were later printed in a group under the caption "Heart Fancies: A Series of Sonnets" (I [1842], 200-201). 13 Probably Confession : or , The Blind Heart ; A Domestic Story (1841) and Beauchampe , or The Kentucky Tragedy ; A Tale of Passion (1842). 14 "Oakatibbe; or The Choctaw Sampson" was originally written for the Magnolia under the title of "Slim Sampson" (See Letters , I, 233-234), but was published instead by the Companion in two parts, the first in the November (I, 76-82) and the second in the December, 1841, issue (I, 163-169). An earlier version of the story entitled "Indian Sketch" was published in the Southern Literary Gazette , I (1828), 142-149. 15 In her Editorial Department for the November, 1841, issue, Mrs. Griffin borrowed this statement about the story from Simms's letter and used it as a justification for the inclusion of the story in the Companion (I, 128). 16 John Neal (1793-1876) and Benjamin Griffin were both residents of Portland, Maine, and may have had mutual friends and overlapping interests in publishing enterprises. They probably did not know each other personally, as Griffin was younger and grew up and left the state while Neal was in Charleston and London. During the years after Neal returned to Portland, the Griffins lived in the South. Mrs. Griffin probably contacted him when she sent prospectuses to other writers, but details are unknown. The sixteen Neal letters in the Griffin Papers are lengthy and rich in advice on many facets of editing. Though his irascible nature led him into controversies with many of his peers, Neal was uniformly eager to help beginners — especially crusaders. He thought establishing a first-rate Southern periodical would be an admirable but difficult endeavor. He was also an ardent feminist and wished Mrs. Griffin to succeed as an editress. Neal was one of the most frequent contributors to the Companion . 17 Probably a reference to Simms's articles in the Magnolia discussed above. 18 Samuel Hart, book dealer and Simms's agent in Charleston. 19 Dated by Simms's reference to receiving the first number of the Companion , which was dated October, 1841, but of which Simms undoubtedly received an advance copy. 20 Neal's "One Day in the History of the World," I (1841), 10-13. 21 Richard Henry Wilde (1789-1847) was known as much for his political career (five terms as a Congressman from Georgia) as for his literary achievements. He was an Italian scholar and poet and is best remembered for his "My Life is Like the Summer Rose," which was set to music by Sidney Lanier and others. The poem to which Simms refers here is "Lines Written for Viscountess _____'s Album" (I, 34). 22 George Frederick Holmes (1820-1897) was a Southern educator, author, and scholar. Besides writing for periodicals, he published numerous textbooks. He became professor of ancient languages at the University of Richmond, professor of history and political economics at William and Mary, and was the first president of the University of Mississippi. The article to which Simms refers is "Outlines of an Essay, on the Causes which Contributed to Produce the Peculiar Excellence of Ancient Literature" (I, 56-59). The article continued in the following issue (I [1841], 112-120). Apparently Simms's criticism of the notes caused Mrs. Griffin to omit them in the November issue, for in the Editorial Department for the month she says, "We may as well add that the essay was accompanied with a vast number of Notes, which displayed the extensive and critical reading of the author, but which we were obliged to omit" (I, 128). 23 "Education" by Professor J. Darby. (I, 51-55) Two additional articles by Darby appeared in subsequent issues: "Early Instruction" (I [1841], 121-123) and "Elementary Instruction" (I [1841], 186-188). In the Editorial Department for October, 1841, under the subject "Georgia Female College," Darby is listed as "Prof. of Chemistry and Philosophy" (I, 64). 24 See note 11, above. 25 See note 12, above. 26 An evidence of the Magnolia's want of variety is seen in the fact that two pieces of Simms's ("Logoodie" and "The Prayer of the Lyre") appeared in the Magnolia in 1836, 1839, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, and 1846 ( See Letters , I, 66, note 2). 27 Sarah L. Griffin, Familiar Tales for Children (n.d.). 28 Sarah L. Griffin and M. M. Mason, Southern Primary Reader, Southern Second Class Reader , Southern Third Class Reader , Southern Fourth Class Reader (n.d.). Simms gave a favorable review of these books in the Magnolia , n.s. I (1842), 126. 29 Simms's third daughter, Agnes, was born on May 28, 1841, and died on July 28, 1841. 30 I.e., "Oakatibbe." See note 14, above. 31 Dated by references to the first issue of the Companion . 32 According to Alexander S. Salley, it was about this time that "a species of guerilla warfare was begun between the Knickerbocker and the Mirror on one hand and Simms on the other. Cornelius Matthews, Evert Duyckinck, and Edgar Allan Poe were at times involved in the quarrel, the background of which is not entirely clear" ( Letters , I, lxxiv). Part of the trouble with the Knickerbocker , according to Parks, arose when Simms "began demanding pay for his contributions to the magazine" ( Simms as Critic , p. 94). It also had something to do with Simms's longtime quarrel with Willis Clark, editor of the Knickerbocker , over sectional literature. (See Letters , I, note 73, p. 320, 322, and the sketch on Clark and his brother, I, xcviii-xcvix.) Mrs. Griffin became involved in the discussion, as well. See "The Knickerbocker and Southern Periodicals" in Companion , I (1842), 820. 33 See note 15, above. 34 "Poetry of the Bible" by Rev. Thomas Curtis began in the first number of the Companion (I [1841], 27) and continued in subsequent numbers of Vols. I, II, and III. 35 "The Ins and Outs, or the Last of the Bamboozled — By a Disappointed Man" (I [1841], 13-23) was written by John Neal. 36 XXIII (1841), 104-107. 37 Dated by the postmark and by the reference to the Charleston Courier "of this day." The notice of the Companion for September 29, 1841, in the Courier (XXXIX, 2) was an enthusiastic review of the first number. The review concludes, "From the specimen before us we are certain that this work will deserve, and we hope it will command success." Also dated by Simms's reference to his "new work" which was shortly to be published. This is probably a reference to The Confession , the only work of Simms published in 1841 besides The Kinsman , which was published in February or March. In a letter to James Lawson dated September 10, 1841, Simms says, "In a short time, I suppose, you will see a new work of mine, told in the first person, called 'Confession or the Blind Heart'" ( Letters , I, 278). 38 See note 37, above. 39 James Edward Henry (1796-1850) of Spartanburg, South Carolina, was the author of "Tales of the Packolette," which was published in the Magnolia . Like Simms, Henry served in the South Carolina House of Representatives. (See Letters , II, 344.) 40 The Simmons brothers, William Hayne (1784-1870) and James Wright (c. 1790-1858) were close friends of Simms's. William contributed frequently to the Southern Quarterly Review under Simms's editorship, and James was associated with Simms in editing and publishing the Southern Literary Gazette . (See sketches in Letters , I, cxxxvii.) William Simmons was the author of The History of the Seminoles to which Simms refers in this letter. 41 The History of South Carolina from Its First European Discovery to Its Erection into a Republic : with a Supplementary Chronicle of Events to the Present Time (1840). 42 Simms later decided against doing a history of Georgia. See letter dated November 3, 1841, to B. F. Griffin, below. 43 See notes 27 and 28, above. 44 Carl Werner : an Imaginative Story ; with Other Tales of Imagination , 2 vols.

See letter dated September 28, 1841. 46 James Lawson (1799-1880) was probably Simms's closest friend and the person with whom he most frequently corresponded. Lawson was born in Scotland and came to America at the age of sixteen. He was a poet, writer of romance and fiction, and playwright as well as a newspaper editor. 47 Lawson's "Moral and Mental Portraits: William Cullen Bryant," Southern Literary Messenger , VI (1840), 106-114. 48 We have been unable to locate this review. 49 Dated by the reference in the following letter of the same date to Benjamin F. Griffin regarding the publication of Simms's History of South Carolina which Simms had inquired about in his letter of September 28, 1841. 50 See note 49, above. This letter and the letter to Mrs. Griffin dated November 3, 1841, were written on the same sheet of paper. 51 See letter dated September 28, 1841, and note 41, above. 52 "The Defense of Slavery" is probably a reference to Simms's review of Harriet Martineau's Society in America , which appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger (III [1837], 641-657), under the title "Miss Martineau on Slavery" and was later reprinted in pamphlet form under the title Slavery in America , Being a Brief Review of Miss Martineau on that Subject (1838). 53 The "Parley Books" were a series of popular books beginning with The Tales of Peter Parley About America (1827) by "Peter Parley" (pseudonym for Samuel Griswold Goodrich [1793-1860]), which were rather syrupy, innocuous books of moral instruction and literature. 54 Israel Keech Tefft (1794-1862), a close friend of Simms, in whose Savannah home many of the literary figures of the day gathered. (See Letters , I, cxxxix.) 55 Jarend Sparks (1789-1866), editor, historian, and noted biographer of figures of the American Revolution. 56 Simms carried out the three projects he lists here, although they were not published by the Griffins: The Life of Francis Marion (1844); a biographical sketch of General Thomas Sumter appeared, along with other biographical sketches written by Simms, in Rufus W. Griswold's Washington and the Generals of the American Revolution , 2 vols. (1847); The Life of Nathanael Greene, Major-General in the Army of the Revolution (1849). Simms wrote other biographies as well, including lives of Chevalier Bayard and Captain John Smith. 57 William Bacon Stevens (1815-1887) was one of the founders of the Georgia Historical Society and the author of a two-volume history of Georgia, A History of Georgia , I (1847); II (1859). Volume I was reviewed by Simms in the Southern Quarterly Review , XIII (1848), 470-501. (See Letters , I, cxxxviii.) 58 John Darby, Manual of Botany (1841). For another reference to Darby, see note 23, above. 59 Dated by the reference to the Lawson subscription. See Introduction and letter dated October 14, 1841, above. 60 See note 46, above. 61 Payment for the Lawson subscription apparently was not settled in accordance with this promise. Considerable heat was generated over the matter, though the amount was trivial. See Letters , I, 322, 371-372, and 374-375. 62 This is probably a reference to the controversy with William Tappan Thompson. See the Introduction. 63 Beauchampe , or the Kentucky Tragedy (1842). The "companions" to which Simms refers are Richard Hurdis ; or , the Avenger of Blood : A Tale of Alabama , 2 vols. (1838) and Border Beagles : A Tale of Mississippi , 2 vols. (1840). In a letter to Benjamin F. Perry, dated July 14, 1842, Simms explains the reason for his anonymous authorship: "The particular purpose with which the anonymous was adopted in respect to these books, has been answered. This was, in part, the bedevilment of the small tribe of underlying critics, who are sagacious enough to detect a man's style in his sneeze, and his talent in a whisper. You perhaps are not aware that in my birthplace even to this day, nothing is more common than to contrast the works of the author of Beauchampe, Rd. Hurdis &amp;c, with my own greatly to my disparagement."

      <field name="heading_text">The "Ralegh Group" in The Phoenix Nest by Michael Rudick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The attribution to Sir Walter Ralegh of twelve poems printed without ascriptions from sigs. K1 v through L1 in The Phoenix Nest (1593) was proposed by Hoyt H. Hudson in 1930. 1 In the following year, Hudson announced his discovery of five Ralegh attributions in British Museum MS Harley 7392 and used these not only to support his identification of the "Ralegh group" but also to add to it one more poem, printed on sig. L1-L1 v . 2 In her second edition of Ralegh's poems, Agnes Latham included, with a caveat , nine poems of Hudson's thirteen plus the three following poems (through sig. L2) in a section of conjectural attributions to Ralegh. Four poems in the group, which now numbered sixteen poems, Miss Latham printed as authentically Ralegh's. 3 I list below by first lines the sixteen poems constituting the group, together with such evidence as exists elsewhere for their attributions. The numbers are those of the poems in Miss Latham's edition. XLII. Feede still thy selfe, thou fondling with beliefe (K1 v -K2). Unique copy. XLIII. My first borne loue unhappily conceiued (K2-K2 v ). Unique copy. XLIV. The brainsicke race that wanton youth ensures (K2 v ). Unique copy. XLV. Those eies which set my fancie on a fire (K2 v -K3). Printed, perhaps from the present copy, without ascription in William Barley's A New Booke of Tabliture (1596). X. Praisd be Dianas faire and harmles light (K3). Originally subscribed "S. W. R." in Englands Helicon (1600); the attribution was cancelled by a pasted-on slip reading " Ignoto ." Accepted by Miss Latham as Ralegh's. XI. Like to Hermite poore in place obscure (K3-K3 v ). At least ten anonymous sixteenth- and seventeenth-century copies, but printed as Breton's in Brittons Bowre of Delights (1591); attributed to Ralegh only in To day a man, To morrow none: Or, Sir Walter Rawleighs Farewell to his Lady (1644). A manuscript in the Edinburgh University Library with a copy headed "Sir Walter Rayeley's Last Eligie" is cited from a secondary source by Miss Latham; the title indicates a derivation from the 1644 print, which gives the poem as among Ralegh's derniers cris , but a confusion in Miss Latham's reference leaves the matter doubtful. 4 Miss Latham accepts the poem as Ralegh's. XII. Like truthles dreames, so are my ioyes expired (K3 v ). Printed over the initials "W. R." in Le Prince d'Amour (1660); the refrain line, "Of all which past, the sorow onely staies," is quoted by Ralegh as his own work in the eleventh book of Cynthia , 5 making this as certain an attribution as one has for Ralegh. XLVI. A secret murder hath bene done of late (K3 v -K4). Subscribed "finis: Goss:" in Bodleian MS Rawlinson Poetry 85; no other attributions. XLVII. Sought by the world, and hath the world disdain'd (K4). Unique copy. XLVIII. Hir face, Hir tong, Hir wit (K4-K4 v ). Ten anonymous sixteenth- and seventeenth-century copies; subscribed "Raley" in MS Harley 7392 and "W. R." in Le Prince d'Amour . It is, however, included in British Museum MS Egerton 3165, Sir Arthur Gorges's manuscript of his own poems, and is accepted as Gorges's by Helen Sandison. 6 IX. Calling to minde mine eie long went about (K4 v ). Attributed to Ralegh in two sixteenth-century manuscripts, Harley 7392 and Cambridge University Library MS Dd.5.75, and by Puttenham in The Arte of English Poesie (1589) where two lines are quoted to illustrate a rhetorical figure; also ascribed to Ralegh in three seventeenth-century manuscript miscellanies and in Wits Interpreter (1655). A solidly documented attribution, accepted by Miss Latham. XLIX. What else is hell, but losse of blisful heauen (L1). Unique copy. L. Would I were chaung'd into that golden showre (L1-L1 v ). Attributed to Ralegh in MS Harley 7392; elsewhere anonymous, but included by Gorges in MS Egerton 3165 and accepted as his by Miss Sandison. LI. Who plucks thee down frõ hie desire poor hart? Care (L1 v ). Unique copy. LII. Those eies that holds the hand of euery hart (L1 v -L2). Three other anonymous copies; printed as Breton's in Brittons Bowre of Delights . LIII. Who list to heare the sum of sorrowes state (L2). Unique copy. Hudson's argument was based primarily upon the grouping of the poems in The Phoenix Nest . He believed that poems IX, XI, XII, XLVIII, and L were "well authenticated" members of the Ralegh canon, that X was "usually accepted," and that XLVII could with confidence be attributed to Ralegh on biographical grounds. Given this core of seven poems, the eight, later nine, surrounding them he attributed to Ralegh, first, because of their similarity in style to the core poems, second, because of their contiguity, and third, because of groupings of several poems by one author elsewhere in the anthology. 7 By and large, Hudson's hypothesis has met with little disagreement. The discovery of MS Egerton 3165 and its claims for Gorges of XLVIII and L, first announced in 1946, 8 did not prevent Miss Latham from printing the group as conjecturally Ralegh's in 1951, and the authenticity of the group was accepted with little deviation by Philip Edwards, outright and uncritically by Walter Oakeshott, and implicitly by A. L. Rowse. 9 Now is perhaps the time to point out that Hudson's hypothesis was adumbrated in similar form in 1870 by an anonymous reviewer of John Hannah's edition The Courtly Poets from Raleigh to Montrose . This writer observed, . . . in the poetical miscellany The Phoenix Nest , published in 1593, there is a series of eight poems, beginning with the sonnet "Those eyes which set my fancy on a fire" [XLV], all addressed to Queen Elizabeth, in the same style as the fragment from Cynthia . Of these four [XI, XII, XLVIII, IX] are admitted to be certainly Raleigh's; and one [X] is admitted as doubtful. If internal evidence is of any validity, the three others [XLV, XLVI, XLVII] are his likewise. But then, as though to show the perversities of attribution by internal evidence, the reviewer goes on to say that two more poems in Hudson's Ralegh group, XLIII and XLIX, might reasonably be ascribed to Shakespeare. 10 It might further be pointed out that R. W. Bond thought five poems in the group (XLII, XLIV, XLV, X, LII) were, again on internal evidence, attributable to Lyly, 11 that Hyder Rollins thought that XLIII bore similarity to Lodge's manner, 12 and that Ralph Sargent believed LIII to be very probably Dyer's. 13 To consider opinions on the group other than Hudson's is, then, to conclude that the ease with which the latter's arguments have been accepted may have been undeserved. Hudson's and Miss Latham's speculations on the configuration of the group ought to be scrutinized more carefully than they have been, since it is problematical whether their judgments are any more deserving of uncritical acceptance than those of Bond, Rollins, Sargent, or the anonymous reviewer of Hannah's volume. The internal evidence for attributing the group to Ralegh is set forth fairly, with positive and negative points duly noted, by Miss Latham (pp. xlv-li). In what follows, I invite the reader to consider, in more detail than has been previously offered, the external evidence. We should begin with the principle upon which the alleged existence of the group rests. There are many examples of poems attributed to one author being grouped together in miscellanies, but usually the author's name or initials appear, as do Breton's, Lodge's, and Watson's with their grouped poems in The Phoenix Nest. 14 To postulate such a group in Ralegh's case here would be to suspect, at least, that the mass of unattributed poems from sigs. K1 v through N4 in The Phoenix Nest was drawn from a manuscript miscellany which itself grouped the poems supposedly Ralegh's, since it is improbable that the editor of the print would have gone through the trouble of culling them from different sources, grouping them, and yet omitting the attributions. The assumption must then be that the editor suppressed the attributions for some reason. The reason usually adduced, that Ralegh was a courtier and so would have been offended by publicity as a poet (Latham, pp. 102-3), may be sensible, but may equally well be mistaken since there is no unequivocal indication of Ralegh's own feeling on the matter. In any case, there are too many examples of miscellany poems ascribed in print to courtiers, even noblemen, to lend overwhelming weight to the conjecture. All this is, of course, surmise, not evidence, but the doubtful status of the group principle as applied to these poems in The Phoenix Nest ought to be admitted at the outset. But allow for the moment that the principle may be relevant; if we can suspect that we are here dealing with poems that are somehow demarcated from what precedes and what follows them, the attribution of the entire series to one poet cannot be proposed unless a substantial core of poems within the series can be authenticated as the work of that poet without recourse to speculative or conjectural judgments. For this kind of authentication, stylistic similarities and biographical associations are too vague to be acceptable; only documentation will serve. Hudson believed that the core of seven poems (IX, X, XI, XII, XLVII, XLVIII, L) was substantial enough, and perhaps it might be if one could be certain that all seven were the unquestionable work of Ralegh. If we begin, however, with the assumption that the core must be authenticated before conjectures can be discussed, and if we apply consistent criteria for attribution to the core, 15 an altogether different view of the problem may be reached. The discovery of Gorges's collection, MS Egerton 3165, should take away from Ralegh two of Hudson's core poems, XLVIII and L. This manuscript, whose title alone — "The Vanytyes of Sir Arthur Gorges Youthe" — should establish the authorship of its contents, is a secretarial transcript corrected in numerous places by Gorges's own hand; its authority supersedes whatever the miscellanies have to tell, and the attribution of L to Ralegh in Le Prince d'Amour and of both to him in MS Harley 7392 is testimony only of the unreliability of those books. 16 Miss Latham admitted the dubiousness of the case when she wrote, "Gorges should be the best judge of what he himself wrote," but she went on to imply, if I understand her correctly, the possibility that since Gorges had no reason to indicate the authorship of poems other than his own in the manuscript, such poems may be in it (p. xlvii). But Gorges's editor, Miss Sandison, is certain that "The Vanytyes of Sir Arthur Gorges Youthe" is not a miscellany, 17 and it would appear vain to continue to deny Gorges the authorship of XLVIII and L. The attribution of XI depends entirely on the witness of the pamphlet To day a man, To morrow none , compiled by one R. H. and printed some sixty years after the poem's early appearances in manuscripts. 18 The pamphlet's four leaves contain Ralegh's letter of farewell to his wife, written when he expected to be executed in 1603 (though it is here assigned to 1618, a common error in seventeenth-century copies), and two poems, Ralegh's valediction (XL in Miss Latham's edition) and the one now in question. The date alone should make the attribution worthless, but it is suspect for other reasons as well. In its sixteenth-century copies, the poem is a sonnet; as printed in 1644, however, the sonnet's concluding couplet serves as a refrain after each quatrain. This form indicates that the printer's copy derives from a musical setting of the poem, 19 and a musical setting would normally not be ascribed to anyone but the composer. Then, it appears alone on the verso of the final leaf, where space needed to be filled; there is at least the possibility that the printer, seeking to fill the need, simply took to hand an available poem of elegiac sentiment and printed Ralegh's name under it. It also might be noted that two of the pamphlet's items, the 1603 letter and poem XL, circulated together in seventeenth-century miscellanies (e.g., Folger Library MS J.a.2, fols. 86 v -87), but nowhere that I know is XI found with them. X provides a more complex problem; it and one other poem, "Sheepheard, what's Loue, I pray thee tell" (rejected by Miss Latham in 1951), had cancel slips reading " Ignoto " pasted over the subscriptions "S. W. R." in the 1600 edition of Englands Helicon . Two other poems, originally subscribed "M. F. G.," also received the cancel treatment in the same book, and Miss Latham believed that Ralegh and Fulke Greville had learned of the ascriptions and insisted the printer suppress evidence of their authorship. Not wishing to offend powerful courtiers, the printer, it is argued, complied by printing the cancels and having them affixed. I find this hypothesis untenable; a cruder and more ineffectual means of disguising authorship is hard to imagine, particularly since the cancels apparently came off rather easily. 20 In the second place, the assumption that Ralegh, or any courtier, would have gone to this length to keep his initials out of print is perhaps exaggerated. Ralegh had himself authorized commendatory poems for Gascoigne and Spenser to be printed in 1576 and 1590 with his name or initials (I, XIII, XIV in Miss Latham's edition), he had been named as a poet and had his verse quoted by Puttenham in 1589 without repercussion, and had in 1596 affixed his initials to the printing of The Discoverie . . . of Guiana . I think we should conclude that the printer of Englands Helicon found that mistakes had been made in these cases, and that the cancels are honest, if futile, efforts at correction. To support this, one need only look at the epistle to the reader, written probably by Nicholas Ling, 21 whose theme is little more than an apology for the attributions made in the volume, suggesting that the anthology's compiler had small reason to be confident in them. The lack of confidence was justified, and if Ralegh or Greville complained, it was more likely due not to the use, but to the misuse, of their initials. One of the "M. F. G." poems, "Oh Woods vnto your walks my bodie hies," was subscribed "I. F." in the 1614 edition of the Helicon and had been attributed to Lodge in The Phoenix Nest ; the other, "Loues Queene long wayting for her trueloue," was, like the first, not printed in the 1633 edition of Greville's Workes . The only authentic poem of Greville's in the anthology ( Caelica 52) is unascribed. Of five poems subscribed with Sir Edward Dyer's name or initials, only one ("Prometheus") is certainly his; two are poems from Lodge's Rosalynde (1590), another is attributed to Lodge in The Phoenix Nest , and the fifth has only the anthology's ascription to speak for it. Dyer was an influential courtier in 1600, but he seems not to have complained about the abuse of his initials. The attributions of X and "Sheepheard, what's Loue" to Ralegh in British Museum MS Harley 280, Francis Davison's first-line catalogue of miscellany poems, come from Davison's having lifted the cancels, as he did with the "M. F. G." items as well. It hardly becomes modern scholarship to be as credulous as Davison. Hudson's biographical ascription of XLVII, since it adduces no specific evidence beyond the supposition that the poem was written to Queen Elizabeth, has nothing more than speculation to commend it. Thus of his seven core poems, there remain two, IX and XII, which can be accepted as authentically Ralegh's. The certainty of two poems is no grounds for the certainty, or even the probability, of fourteen more, XLVIII and L are surely the property of Gorges. A fair, but inconclusive, case can be made for ascribing LII to Breton. 22 The attribution of XLVI to one "Goss:" (Gosson?) in MS Rawlinson Poetry 85 may be worthless. We must be content to leave the rest anonymous.</field>

K1 v -K3. I know of no examples of Ralegh groups more extensive than four poems; further, it should be pointed out that a string of poems attributed to Ralegh in a miscellany is not to be equated with a string of authentic ascriptions. 15 In particular, a principle adduced by Samuel Schoenbaum with reference to drama attributions: "External evidence cannot be ignored, no matter how inconvenient such evidence may be for the theories of the investigator" ("Internal Evidence and the Attribution of Elizabethan Plays," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , LXV [1961], 107; reprinted in Evidence for Authorship: Essays on Problems of Attribution , ed. David Erdman and Ephim Fogel [1966], p. 191; see also Schoenbaum's extended study, Internal Evidence and Elizabethan Dramatic Authorship: An Essay in Literary History and Method [1966], pp. 163ff). 16 William Ringler ( The Poems of Sir Philip Sidney [1962], p. 353) found the manuscript incorrect in one-third of its ascriptions. 17 Poems of Gorges , pp. xxxiv-xxxvii; this despite the appearance in it of a poem subscribed with Churchyard's name. It should be recorded that Oakeshott was content to omit XLVIII from the canon, but insisted on retaining L for what, to me, seem absurd reasons ( The Queen and the Poet , pp. 95, 166-7). 18 Poem number XI dates from the 1580's, as evidenced by its transcription in British Museum MS Additional 38823 (fol. 58 v ), a notebook of Sir Edward Hoby, there headed "Incerti Authoris." Today a man is reprinted by E. W. Ashbee, Occasional Facsimile Reprints , No. XXVI (1872). 19 This was the common practice in setting sonnets; cf. the treatment of Sidney's Old Arcadia 45 in British Museum MS Additional 15117 (Ringler, Sidney , p. 556) and that given the present poem in Ferrabosco's Ayres (1609) and in Playford's Select Musical Ayres (1652), where lines 13-14 follow lines 1-4. The 1644 text may be derived from or related to an anonymous copy in Folger MS V.a.169 (fol. 10 v ), which uses 13-14 as a refrain and matches the 1644 text in transposing what are in the earlier copies the second and third quatrains. This textual similarity has been noted by Miss Hughey ( Arundel Harington MS , II, 314). 20 The John Rylands Library copy is the only one known to have kept its cancels intact; its text of X and that in one of the Bodleian copies are shown in photographs in Oakeshott, plate VI. 21 See J. William Hebel, "Nicholas Ling and Englands Helicon," The Library , 4th ser., V (1925), 153-60. 22 Its appearances in Brittons Bowre of Delights and in The Arbor of Amorous Devises (1597) do not constitute authoritative attributions, but the poem is transcribed in British Museum MS Additional 34064 among poems tolerably well established as Breton's. In his edition of the Bowre (1933), pp. xvi-xix, Hyder Rollins discussed the problems of attribution in that book and the Arbor and came to an estimate of Breton's share.

      <field name="heading_text">John Beale's Compositors in A King and No King Q1(1619) by Hans Walter Gabler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "The Printing of A King and No King Q1" ( SB XVIII, [1965], 255-261), Robert K. Turner Jr. established from evidence of running-titles, type reappearances, and type substitutions that the quarto (1619) was set seriatim , and set from one case of type only; and that it was imposed and printed in one skeleton-forme from the beginning of work at B(i/o) through G(i), and thereafter — from G(o) to A(i/o) — in two skeleton-formes in alternation. The demonstrable facts about the printing lead Turner to infer the work of two compositors in the setting of the text. In close vicinity to the point where the second skeleton was introduced he observed a change in the manner of signing: while in sheets B through G only leaves 1 to 3 of a gathering are signed, in sheets H through L and sheet A each fourth leaf in the gathering carries a signature also. This one typographical mark of distinction was offered as the only piece of tangible evidence for a shift of workmen at the type-cases. Turner discovered no other clearly divergent habits of orthography or typography to support the compositorial division. However, as the inference of the presence of two compositors was drawn from the facts established about the printing of the quarto, it appears perfectly sound by all commonly accepted standards of bibliographical analysis. Nevertheless, we shall attempt to show that there is evidence which suggests that not two, but altogether no fewer than four compositors were at work on A King and No King Q1. It is true, as Turner said in a footnote, that there is a great likeness in compositorial habits throughout the book. The spellings observed appear at first sight to be no more diverse than one might expect them from even just one single workman. It is in the hope of establishing something like statistical evidence, therefore, that one is lead to scrutinize the spellings in some of the most common locations of orthographical variation, in the -e/ee of pronouns and the verb ( be ), and in the -y/ie endings of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. In doing so, however, one must guard against the possibility that the observable patterns may result from, and consequently be obscured by, complex and diverging compositorial habits. In the matter of final -y/ie , for example, it is known that a compositor may vary his treatment according to the preceding vowel, consonant, or group of consonants. In addition, it also seems fair to assume that while exercising his personal preference within a large and divers group of words ending in -y or -ie whenever, by the singular occurrence of each word, he felt invited to do so, a compositor might yet be indifferent to the spellings, say, of the adverbial ending -ly , or of such common forms as very, any, many, euery . It is on an assumption of such variation that we have established more than one column for possible -y/ie endings in our analytical table. The numbers in the -ly/lie and very etc. /verie etc. columns are given merely for the sake of information and comparison, and only the counts in the main -y/ie column form the basis of one section of our spelling test. Included in this column are the occurrences of specific test words ( Maiesty/ Maiestie, body/bodie, pitty/pittie, Countrey/countrie, thirty/thirtie, twenty/twentie, beauty/beautie ) which are supplied by the text in sufficient quantities, or stand in positions significant enough for them to be singled out as evidence. In the other section of our test, the -e/ee spellings, a grouping together of ( me, he, we, be ) in their -e and -ee variants, and a singling out of she/shee for ( she ), is a division prompted by the very results of the spelling tests for this play themselves. Beginning our analysis where, according to Turner, the work on the quarto began, we find: Compositor I for sheet B. His characteristics are an even mixture of -e and -ee in ( me, he, we, be ), in a ratio of 46:46, and — except for one -ie on his first page, B1 — only -y endings, showing a preference for -y which extends fully to -ly and the forms of ( very, any, many, euery ) also. Compositor II for sheet C, and possibly D1. He strongly prefers the single -e in ( me, he, we, be ), and, except for two cases of obvious rhetorical emphasis in verse on C2 and C2 v , he sets the long -ee forms only a few times in full prose lines, presumably for justification. Assuming that Compositor II's work did extend through D1, the e:ee ratio is 101:11. His preference for -ie is even stronger: against 36 instances of -ie, -y occurs only twice, in Lady . However, here the pattern does not extend into the -ly/lie and the very/verie columns; the spelling of these forms is -y , with only one exception. At D1 v , characteristics change. We assume that a new workman, Compositor III , took over at D1 or D1 v . He cannot have been Compositor I, as there is no recurrence of the exclusive -y preference, nor of the even mixture of -e/ee . Neither can he have been Compositor II; for the almost exclusive -ie preference which characterized sheet C is now also broken. The -y/ie spellings become mixed, according to no readily discernible pattern. There is a small surplus of -y spellings (the y:ie ratio is 71:64), although the balance seems to be shifting from a -y preference at the beginning to an -ie preference towards the end of the section which — on the basis of the she/shee spellings, as will be explained below — we take to extend from D1 v through H2. In test words, there is one Maiesty on D2 against ten Maiestie between D4 v and G3; three body (D1 v , D4, E4 v ) against four bodie (three on F3, one on F4). This shift might reveal features of the copy; it is at least a possibility that the copy had a decided -ie preference. 1 On the strength of the noted increase in -ie spellings in what we take to be Compositor III's work, one would then assume that he, although relatively indifferent to -y/ie , began with a slight preference for -y , but became gradually more influenced by his copy's -ie spellings, until his work, on the evidence of the -y/ie spellings, can no more be distinguished from the composition of the remainder of the book from H2 v to A4 v where the -y/ie ratio is in favour of -ie (30:91). This significant alteration in the ratio of -y/ie endings can now indeed be added to the typographical evidence of the changing signature pattern, as adduced by Turner, to strengthen the assumption that yet another man, Compositor IV , began to work on A King and No King Q1 in sheet H. He did not enter with the beginning of the sheet at H1; for of the five test words within the -y/ie group which we find signalizing the shift of compositors, at least two, Countrey and pitty , appear in their -y forms as late as H1 and H1 v . 2 The dividing line between Compositor III's and Compositor IV's stints should, according to our observations, be drawn at H2/H2 v . For, in addition to a continued preference for -e in ( me, he, we, be ) which has remained the same since Compositor II took over at C1 (and therefore helps to set off only Compositor I's work from what follows), we find in H2 v a sudden switch from shee to she . It is a puzzling fact about this play that the spelling she does not occur a single time before H2 v , and the form shee is painstakingly observed by compositors I, II, and III alike (if our assumption about the number of workmen is correct). From H2 v onwards, however, there is a very definite preference for the short she , interspersed with only a few shee . This holds true up to the pages L4 v and M1; they together suddenly again have 24 shee , and no she . M1 v , M2, and M2 v revert to she (7 she , 1 shee ). In the pages of sheet A, the pronoun does not occur until A4 v , but there it is found four times exclusively as shee . This latter evidence cannot be conclusively interpreted, but — rather than making copy spelling responsible — the bibliographical divisions by which the changes between she and shee occur would point to a collaboration of workmen on the last sheets. While Compositor IV may have set the majority of the last pages from M1 v to A4 — and his hand is certainly in evidence in the signature on A4 — the sudden preponderance of -y endings in A4 v would suggest Compositor III for this page (or even, in combination with the two -ee in verse lines, Compositor I); for L4 v and M1 the evidence is inconclusive, or would suggest Compositor II. In conclusion: it is precisely the bibliographical divisions by which the observable patterns alter which are the main strengthening factor for this entire proposition of four compositors for A King and No King Q1. No more than a bibliographical note on the evidence is intended. What we have presented, therefore, raises more questions than it answers. In the first place, it seems absolutely extraordinary that the work of four compositors should be so similar. Indeed, the identification is not so much based on clear divergences of habits in the compositors as on different combinations of similarities. Turner explained the likeness of his assumed two compositors as faithfulness to copy. Where four compositors are concerned, there is no choice but to make the copy responsible to an even larger degree for the homogeneity in appearance of its printed derivative; and it must have been a very careful, clear, and consistent copy, at that, which elicited from four workmen such even composition. But whether they worked so alike out of convenience in this one instance, or habitually, perhaps because of similar training, or even as a consequence of effective supervision, we do not know. It would take an extensive study of John Beale's printing-house and its compositors to find the answers. 2a Furthermore, the demonstrated presence — if in fact we have satisfactorily demonstrated it — of four compositors in a quarto where the inferences from an analysis of the printing process allowed for only two, could be taken as a case in point, however minor, concurring with the basic critique, as formulated by D. F. McKenzie, 3 of some of the commonly accepted standards of bibliographical analysis by which those inferences were drawn. It may, of course, be just an isolated case, with no strength to support generalizations; we are in no position to tell, just as we are in no position to generalize at all from Turner's and our own findings in A King and No King . On the contrary: with the addition of new evidence, we are actually less able than before to relate the known facts about the composition and printing of this play conclusively to each other. Although, for example, Turner has shown that the text was set from one case of type with a regular reappearance throughout of previously used type, we cannot now say whether the production was continuous or not, for this quarto by itself gives us no clue as to the significance of the multiple shifts of compositors at the one case. That all four should have worked from the same case, however, is of course in itself quite remarkable. 4 Moreover, since we have established stints of composition which do not necessarily tally with the number and the use of skeleton-formes, we are also at a loss to explain just why the change from one-skeleton to two-skeleton printing took place at sheet G. And, although the four men we have identified could hardly have worked simultaneously at or from the same case for any length of time, but must indeed have succeeded each other in composition and distribution, the employment of four compositors does, nevertheless, make it far less easy to assume a clear and self-contained time scheme in the compositor:press relation for this quarto, but rather prepares us to consider concurrent production 5 as a possible mode of book production in John Beale's shop at the time A King and No King Q1 was printed. Yet when so much has been said, it cannot, on the other hand, be emphasized too strongly that, while the identification of four compositors in this quarto may open up the possibility of seeing in A King and No King a case to corroborate D. F. McKenzie's assumptions about conditions of printing in an early seventeenth-century printing-house, our findings have essentially also proved the relevance of the facts presented in R. K. Turner's original study. The methods by which a shift from one- to two-skeleton printing and a change in the signature pattern of the printed sheets were established and related to the presence of a new compositor from sheet H onwards have not been invalidated. 6 Only the options for correlating and interpreting the accumulated bibliographical evidence have been increased and taken to a point where the conclusive answers can only come from a study of much wider scope than the present one. Here, therefore, we must rest content within the limits of a compositorial analysis and leave the questions it raises wide open.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Although Compositor I would then have done most to obliterate this feature of the copy, it may be significant that he got caught out once by an -ie on the first page he set. From the fact that Compositor II twice set Lady , and from the practically exclusive -y in his -ly and very forms, on the other hand, one might conclude that the state of the copy, while there may have been a certain preponderance of -ie endings, is yet more truly represented by the random mixture of -y/ie forms on Compositor III's and Compositor IV's pages than by Compositor II's strong -ie preference. 2 The test words and their occurrences are: Countrey D1 v , D4(3x), H1 / Countrie K2 v pitty E2, H1 v / pittie H3 v (2x), I1 v thirty F4 / thirtie I2 twenty F4 v , G1 / twentie H4 v , I4, K2 beauty E2, E3 v / beautie H3 v (2x) 2a E. A. J. Honigmann's tracing of a second compositor in Q1 of King Lear appears to be a case similar to ours. (E. A. J. Honigmann, "Spelling Tests and the First Quarto of King Lear," The Library , 5th ser., XX [1965], 310-315.) Honigmann reflects upon the possibility of a gradual re-assertion of preferential spellings, after an initial opening to the influence of copy, in the work of a compositor (in which case the compositors of King Lear Q1 would again be reduced to one); and he speculatively puts forward a "style of the house" and/or the mobility of journeymen as reasons for the evasive nature of compositorial habits. In A King and No King , too, one would, if only for the sake of greater simplicity, tend to suspect Compositors I, II, and III of being just one man, after all, were it not for the clear bibliographical divisions of their stints. But, while on the basis of our tests their presence is asserted, their number is yet astonishing. Did John Beale then perhaps employ a sizable crew of journeymen? And did he consequently — in view of the remarkable uniformity of composition — rigorously enforce a housestyle? We simply do not know; and to speculate in this direction would merely obscure the present issue, as from an analysis of this single quarto we cannot even attempt to find an answer to such questions, whereas we are able from it to tentatively explore the implications of the facts apparent about the quarto's composition and printing. 3 In SB , XXII (1969), 1-75. 4 We might, of course, be tempted to say that the setting, at least, was 'continuous' in relation to the use and re-use of type from the one case, but even such an assumption would be hazardous as long as proof was lacking that the case in question was used solely on this job for as long as the quarto was printing. 5 See McKenzie, passim , especially pp. 15-29. 6 McKenzie's critique is itself of course not aimed at invalidating current bibliographical methods, but rather at evaluating their strength and comprehensiveness under the aspect of bibliographical theory.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of James Shirley's The Polititian (1655) * by Robert J. Fehrenbach</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1655 Humphrey Moseley brought out The Polititian , a play written by James Shirley in 1639. The procedure used in printing The Polititian was extremely rare for the seventeenth century: the play was printed in both octavo and quarto formats machined from the same typesetting. These two "simultaneous issues" of one edition, as W. W. Greg calls such products, 1 contain apparent signature errors, and Edward Huberman, in an attempt to determine the priority of the printing of the two formats, studied the signature misprints and concluded that the octavo and quarto sheets of this bibliographical rarity were printed in no consistent order. 2 Sometimes, he argues, the octavo sheets were printed first and the appropriate quarto sheets followed in the press; at other times the process was reversed. In his description of The Polititian in A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , Greg agrees with Huberman's analysis of the printing procedure (II, 861). Having examined thirteen copies of the 1655 text, 3 I believe that there was a consistent order of printing, and that still additional copies of a pre-Restoration drama should be included in the list of fakes made up by the infamous bibliophile, Thomas J. Wise. The Gentleman of Venice (1655), another play by Shirley published by Moseley and The Polititian 's companion piece in publication, was also printed in this unusual manner. The close printing relationship of these two plays is relevant to a discussion of the priority of the two sizes of The Polititian , for if the publications were intimately related in the press, they probably would have been printed by the same procedure, and the second to have come from the press would surely have been machined by the same process as the first. Both plays were published in quarto sizes to match many of Shirley's plays previously printed in quarto, and in octavo formats to fit with Shirley's recently published octavo volume, Six New Playes (1653), also issued by Humphrey Moseley. This is the only logical explanation that accounts for this unusual and complicated printing procedure. 4 Greg, who discusses the octavo issues of the two plays as a "collection," believes it quite probable that only the quarto issues of the two plays were sold separately and that the octavo copies were always sold bound together as a supplement to Six New Playes (III, 1124-1125). 5 In addition, the two 1655 publications contain typographical similarities which indicate their proximity in the press. "James Shirley" on the title-page of both sizes of both plays is from the same typesetting. The imprint is exactly the same in all copies save for two small but significant variations to be discussed later. 6 The head-line, "The Epistle Dedicatory," is the same in both publications as is the signature "JAMES SHIRLEY" on the same page. 7 Also, the rules and the type of the word FINIS are the same in both plays. 8 All of these identical typographical features have been verified by measurement. Several identical head ornaments are found in both publications, and only these two plays of Shirley's carry the head-line, albeit of different typography, "The names and small Characters of the Persons" 9 and contain brief descriptions of each character in the dramatis personae. 10 In the rest of the plays printed by Humphrey Moseley in 1655, 11 none of these similarities exists except for an occasional similar ornament. All this evidence indicates that The Gentleman of Venice and The Polititian were very close in the press, one probably being printed immediately after the other. Two variations exist in the otherwise identical imprints of both plays. A gap, the width of one piece of type, appears between the H and the u in Humphrey in the quarto issues of The Gentleman of Venice and in both sizes of The Polititian . Greg believes that this gap occurred when the compositor made the change from the octavo forme to the quarto forme in the course of printing The Gentleman of Venice and that this space was carried over into the printing of the title page of The Polititian (II, 857). Furthermore, the e in be is properly placed in the imprint in The Gentleman of Venice but is raised significantly in the imprint in The Polititian . These two typographical variations indicate that The Gentleman of Venice was printed first and that the imprint, which was set up correctly, experienced some minor, unnoticed variations as it stood in type or was transferred from one galley to another. For The Polititian to have been printed first, we would have to believe that the compositor corrected one error in the imprint (in be ) and ignored another even more obvious mistake (in Humphrey ). Because of the various limitations connected with early printing it is highly unlikely that an entire work, unless it were an extremely short piece, stood in type at any one time. It is much more reasonable to assume that a forme or two was placed in type and after the desired number of sheets were printed, the type was distributed and reused for other formes. Similarly, when one work was printed in both octavo and quarto formats from a single typesetting, it is unlikely that one size was printed entirely before the other size went to the press. It is more likely that a printer first imposed the type-pages in one forme and printed the sheets of the appropriate format; then he reimposed the type-pages in the other forme, made the necessary signature changes, and machined the sheets of the other size. The question of the printing priority of the two sizes of each of these two plays is, then, a question of which sheets were printed first, not which entire format. Greg warns that it is unwise to assert that a printing priority of octavo sheets to quarto sheets, or quarto to octavo, was consistently followed. 12 But if all of the evidence suggests one process, only extreme caution would prohibit one from making a reasonable conjecture about the printing priority of the sheets. No octavo copy of The Gentleman of Venice contains any signature misprint (Greg, II, 857). In three quartos examined by Huberman, in all of the quartos examined by and brought to the attention of Greg, and in the one quarto of The Gentleman of Venice I examined, B1-B3 are misprinted C1-C3 and quires A and E are fully signed. 13 Greg notes that in the quarto, A2 and K2 are left unsigned while the signature K2 appears on K4 (II, 857). All of these misprints in the quarto (except the misplacement of K2 on K4 and the omission of A2 which indicate nothing but carelessness) can be explained by the retention of all or part of the octavo signatures when the compositor reimposed the play for the quarto issue. A4 does not appear in quarto, but it is normal for octavo. E4 appears where C4 appears in octavo (p. 33 of both sizes); the E is correct for quarto, but the 4 is correct for octavo. Finally, those sheets (B1-B3) that are misprinted C1-C3 in the quarto issue are right for octavo. From the first-mentioned variation in the imprint (the gap between the H and the u in Humphrey ) and from the misprinted signatures, it is reasonable to believe, as does Greg (II, 857), that the octavo sheets were printed before the quarto sheets in The Gentleman of Venice . In all quarto copies of The Polititian , only one misprint of a signature is found: A4, which already has been noted as unusual for quarto but normal for octavo, appears in the quarto issue. Unlike The Gentleman of Venice , however, there are apparent signature misprints in two of the octavo copies; the remainder of the smaller-sized copies carry correct signatures. In an octavo issue in the British Museum (hereafter referred to as BM8) C2 is misprinted as E2, and in another octavo in the University of Texas Library (hereafter referred to as T8) C3 is misprinted as E3, C5-C6 as F1-F2, D2-D3 as G2-G3, and D6 as H2. 14 All of these misprints are correct signatures for quarto. From an examination of the unusual A4 signature in all the quartos and the several misprints in two of the octavos, both Greg (II, 861) and Huberman (p. 107) conclude that some sheets were printed first in octavo and then reimposed in quarto and that others went first to the press in quarto and were reimposed in octavo. In my examination of BM8 and T8, however, I discovered: (1) those leaves with the supposed signature misprints, contain typographical variants identical with those found in the regular quarto sheets; 15 (2) an occasional leaf in T8 and BM8 which is unsigned in both octavo and quarto and which corresponds in pagination (e.g., [K3] in quarto and [E7] in octavo are both page 67) contains the typographical characteristics of the quarto leaf instead of those of the octavo leaf; (3) in those leaves with signature misprints (as well as those unsigned leaves that share typographical variants with the corresponding quarto leaves) the chain-lines are horizontal, normal in quarto, while the chain-lines of the rest of the leaves are vertical, an octavo characteristic; and (4) the watermark in each of the suspected leaves, where it can be determined, is in the quarto position. In short, octavo copies BM8 and T8 are filled with inserts, cutdown leaves from quarto copies, and, like the other octavos, do not contain misprints. The only authentic misprint in both sizes of The Polititian is the A4 in the quarto copies. Further evidence that T8 and BM8 are modern made-up copies and do not represent "confusion of sheets in binding some of the individual volumes" which Huberman offers as another possible explanation (p. 107) is that BM8 is in the Ashley Library in the British Museum and T8 is in the Wrenn collection of the University of Texas Library, the two private libraries with which Thomas J. Wise, the famous fraudulent bibliophile, had his closest association. 16 D. F. Foxon, who discovered Wise's deceptive handiwork with pre-Restoration plays, cites all of the plays in Wise's library (the Ashley Library) that appear to be made up. The Polititian , not found in that list, clearly should be added. 17 The evidence and conclusions about the printing of The Polititian , then, are these: it was printed in both octavo and quarto issues, probably as soon as The Gentleman of Venice , also printed in simultaneous issues, cleared the press. As the octavo sheets of the latter probably were printed before the quarto sheets, there is no reason to believe that the process would have been changed for The Polititian . Moreover, the one authentic signature misprint in The Polititian indicates the octavo-to-quarto procedure. Apparently the compositor benefited from the signature errors in The Gentleman of Venice and made only one in the printing of The Polititian .</field>

The remaining six copies are octavos found in the British Museum (2), the Library of Congress (1), The University of Texas (1), and the Victoria and Albert Museum (2). 4 One of the octavo copies of the play in the Victoria and Albert Museum is bound with The Gentleman of Venice and Six New Playes . P. Nissen in his monograph, James Shirley : Ein Beitrag zur englischen Litteraturgeschichte (1901), p. 24 n , states that he found the two plays bound with Six New Playes in the Hamburger Stadtbibliothek. These, however, like those in the Victoria and Albert Museum, appear to have been added to the larger volume at a date later than 1655. 5 The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum each house one such octavo "collection" of The Gentleman of Venice and The Polititian . 6 The imprint reads: LONDON, | Printed for Humphrey Moseley and are to be | sold at his Shop at the Princes Armes in St. | Pauls Church-yard. 1655. 7 Sig.

The copy I examined is in the Folger Shakespeare Library. 14 Greg, II, 861 and Huberman, p. 107, agree with these findings. In addition, Huberman says that he has been informed by the University of Texas Library that another octavo incorrectly reads L1 for F1 (p. 105). The present staff of the library at Austin is unable to find such an octavo; still such a "misprint" would only support the findings of this present study. 15 For example, on p. 29 (sig. E2 in quarto and BM8, sig. C2 in the other octavos), a comma is properly placed after the word danger in the first line in all the quartos and BM8; in the other octavo copies it is raised to the top of the r . On the same page the numeral 29 is unclearly printed in all the quartos and BM8; it is distinctly printed in all the other octavo copies. 16 It is possible that Wise, aware of the authentic misprints in The Gentleman of Venice , decided to make up copies of The Polititian thinking that the model of the former would give credibility and even a touch of authenticity to the made-up texts of the latter. One wonders at the extent of Wise's conscious deception when he reads the bibliographical comment on The Polititian in the Wrenn Catalogue ( A Catalogue of the Library of the Late John Henry Wrenn , compiled by Harold B. Wrenn and edited by Thomas J. Wise [1920], IV, 145) in which Wise notes the signature "misprints" in the octavo T8 and explains them by saying that the play was "first set up in quarto" and then reimposed in octavo. 17 Thomas J. Wise and the Pre-Restoration Drama : A Study in Theft and Sophistication (1959), pp. 37-41. It appears as if the quarto leaves used to complete the imperfect octavos were taken from the now imperfect quarto presently in the Aitken collection at the University of Texas Library. The quarto inserts in BM8 and T8 account for all but two of the missing leaves in the Aitken quarto. Wise, of course, provided Aitken with copies of pre-Restoration plays as he did Wrenn.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A New Light on the Dramatic Works of Thomas Killigrew by Albert Wertheim</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Killigrew is best known through his career as the head of the King's Company, one of the two legitimate Restoration acting companies. Of equal importance, however, is his earlier career as a playwright. As a young man he began writing plays for the private theater audience and the court of Charles I, and continued writing them while in exile on the Continent during the Interregnum. Both the plays written for the Caroline coterie theater and the "closet" dramas written while the English theaters were closed are usually highly mannered and are clearly of limited appeal to a modern reader. The importance of Killigrew's dramatic output, however, cannot be overlooked in any cogent study of the continuity of seventeenth-century drama. In the past, proper assessment of Killigrew's plays has been hampered by the questions that surround the canon of his works and the dating of particular plays. 1 Some of these questions are engendered by the information appearing within the frontispiece engraving in the 1664 folio edition of Killigrew's Comedies and Tragedies and by the assumption that this engraving is an original portrait executed especially for that folio (Harbage, Thomas Killigrew , p. 144). The engraving is, however, based on a 1650 portrait in oils; and, through a comparison of the two portraits, the Killigrew canon can be established with certainty and his Interregnum plays dated with new accuracy and confidence. Killigrew's eight extant plays — The Princess , The Prisoners , Claricilla , The Parson's Wedding , The Pilgrim , Cicilia and Clorinda , Thomaso , or the Wanderer , and Bellamira Her Dream — were all written before or during the Interregnum. These plays were all included within the 1664 folio, but only Claricilla and The Prisoners had enjoyed a previous joint publication in 1641. 2 The portrait engraving by William Faithorne (1616-1691) that accompanies the 1664 folio depicts Killigrew, his dog at his side, sitting at his writing table, above which hangs an oval portrait, possibly by Van Dyke, of King Charles I. 3 In the playwright's hand is a blank manuscript and on his table are piled eight volumes revealing the titles of his plays. From top to bottom these read: "CLARICILLA / THE PRISONERS / THE PRINCESSE / THE PILGRIM / THE PAR WEDDING / THE WANDERER / THE REVENGE". The eighth volume is blank. Two plays that appear in the folio — Cicilia and Clorinda and Bellamira Her Dream — do not appear on the engraving, whereas the title The Revenge , which is depicted, is not contained in the folio nor is there a record either of its publication elsewhere or of its production. G. E. Bentley has prudently speculated, "Probably the two volumes at the bottom of the pile [the blank one and the one labelled The Revenge ] are intended for Bellamira and Cicilia and Clorinda , and we may hazard a guess that The Revenge is a mistaken or alternative title for one of them. It is possible, however, that there was a Killigrew play of this name now unknown" (Bentley, pp. 709-10). Many of Faithorne's portrait engravings are based upon the paintings of Anthony Van Dyke, Sir Peter Lely, and other contemporary portrait painters. 4 In the case of the Thomas Killigrew portrait, we may read in small print outside the margin at the bottom right of the engravings: " W : Faithorne sculp :". At the bottom left, however, is printed the name of the original painter: " W : Sheppard pinx :". Of the painter William Sheppard ( fl . 1650-1660) we know little more today than Horace Walpole did almost two centuries ago when he wrote of Sheppard, "An English artist, of whom I can find no record, but that he lived in this reign [Charles II], near the Royal Exchange, painted Thom. Killigrew with his dog, now at lord Godolphin's, and retired into Yorkshire, where he died." 5 The only fact we can now add to Walpole's scant knowledge is that Faithorne's engraving of Sir Henry Terne, an English admiral, is also based upon a William Sheppard portrait (Fagin, p. 63). Sheppard's portrait of Killigrew, now at the National Portrait Gallery in London, answers all the difficulties posed by the engraving. Like the Faithorne copy, the Sheppard original depicts the playwright at his writing table. 6 In the painting, however, the manuscript in Killigrew's hand is not blank and the books on the table are marked from top to bottom: "CLARICILLA / THE PRISONERS / THE PRINCESSE / THE PILGRIM / THE Par WEDDING / Thō THE WANDERER / CICILIA or the REVENG". The margin of the painting cuts off the final letter of the last of these titles. Beneath these seven volumes, and separated from them by an untitled volume, is an eighth title: "EIKON BAΣΛIK". Here again the title's final letter has been cut off by the margin. The left hand side of the manuscript held by Killigrew reads: "KILLIGRE / RESIDEN / For: C R: / in Venice / 1650". The right hand side of the manuscript reads: "or the / POLIDOR DREAM / ACT: PR: / SCAE. i". On Killigrew's chair is inscribed the name of the painter and the place where the painting was executed: "WM SHEPPARD / PINXIT: VENC". Clearly, the problematic title The Revenge on the 1664 engraving is an alternate title for Cicilia and Clorinda , thus supporting Professor Bentley's speculation. It is also apparent that the title of the play shown on the painting as Cicilia was later expanded to Cicilia and Clorinda and that the subtitle The Revenge was dropped in favor of Love in Arms , the subtitle the play bears in the 1664 folio. Cicilia and Clorinda , or Love in Arms is a tragicomedy, and one might hazard a guess that perhaps the change in subtitle indicates that this play was originally conceived as a tragedy. The painting also suggests that Thomaso , or the Wanderer may once have borne the single title Thomaso the Wanderer . The apparent subtitle or the Polidor Dream , which appears on the right side of the manuscript in Killigrew's hand, must be part of an early version of a title for the play called in the 1664 folio Bellamira Her Dream , or The Love of Shadows , since the hero of that play is named Polidor. The fact that Killigrew is depicted at work on the first scene of this play and that all his other plays are stacked by his side in seemingly finished form suggests that Bellamira Her Dream was his last dramatic work. In any case the 1650 date on the painting and the indication that it was executed in Venice do bear out the folio title pages for Bellamira , which claim that it was written in Venice. It also supports the speculations that this play was written in 1650-1651 (Harbage, Thomas Killigrew , pp. 86-99). Though the Sheppard portrait is an aid in dating Bellamira Her Dream with greater precision, it raises doubts about the dating of Thomaso , or the Wanderer . The left side of the manuscript Killigrew holds reads, "Killigre[w] Residen[t] for C[arolus] R[ex] in Venice 1650," and from the inscription on the arm of the chair we learn that Sheppard painted this portrait in Venice. Since Killigrew was in Venice from early in 1650 until his expulsion in June 1652, he almost certainly sat for this portrait in Venice during 1650. It is extremely curious, then, that among the pile of Killigrew's works appears Thomaso the Wanderer , which Professor Harbage has claimed as Killigrew's last play and which he has shown by irrefutable internal evidence to have been written during the spring of 1654 ( Thomas Killigrew , pp. 218-19). One can only assume that Killigrew had at least begun work on this play by 1650 and that it was revised or completed in 1654. The title Thomaso the Wanderer on the 1650 painting for the play called Thomaso , or the Wanderer in the 1664 folio may perhaps be further evidence that Killigrew revised the work at a later date. Sheppard's inclusion of the word or in Cicilia or the Reveng , even at the expense of not completing the last word of the title, suggests that the omission of or in Thomaso the Wanderer , the volume immediately above Cicilia , is no oversight on Sheppard's part. The appearance of Eikon Basilike underneath the pile of Killigrew's plays on the Sheppard portrait but not on the Faithorne engraving is a final, but minor, difficulty raised by the comparison of painting and engraving. It is highly unlikely that Killigrew could have been the author of this famous but anonymous volume, and its presence in the Sheppard portrait is almost certainly, along with the oval portrait of the late king, a symbol of Killgirew's royalist allegiance. The dropping of the title on the Faithorne engraving, particularly when that engraving appeared during the first years of the Restoration, remains an enigma unless one simply accounts for it, along with the failure to reproduce the writing on Killigrew's manuscript and the shortening of the play titles, as laziness on Faithorne's part.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Arthur Maynwaring, Richard Steele, and the Lives of Two Illustrious Generals by Henry L. Snyder</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the projected works of famous authors that were never completed, Augustan students must particularly regret 'The History of the Duke of Marlborough' that Richard Steele proposed to write. On 3 May 1714 he gave notice in his periodical the Reader (number six) that he had this work in hand. He informed his subscribers that he had "in his Custody, proper Materials for the History of the War in Flanders " and proposed to write a history of the general's career from his appointment as Captain-General until his dismissal from that post at the end of 1711. It is not doubted, but This History, formed from the most authentick Papers, and all the most secret Intelligence which can be communicated with Safety to Persons now living, and in the Confidence of foreign Courts, will be very entertaining, and put the Services of Her Majesty's Ministers at home and abroad in a true Light. The Work is to be printed in Folio , and Proposals for the Encouragement of it may be seen at Mr. Tonson 's, Bookseller, in the Strand . No further discussion of it is to be found in any of his other publications or his correspondence. The proposal is barely mentioned by his biographers. But it may be wrong to presume that he abandoned the project without any attempt to begin it. To be sure the time was not propitious in early 1714. Marlborough was in disgrace and living abroad in self-imposed exile. At Marlborough's death in 1722 a newspaper reported that the great general's papers had been put into Steele's hands for publication, but no further hint is to be found of their disposition. 1 There is one work, however, hitherto ignored by students of Steele that may be linked to this abandoned project. This is The Lives of the Two Illustrious Generals , John , Duke of Marlborough , and Francis Eugene , Prince of Savoy , which appeared in 1713. This work consists of two separate biographies joined together in one volume. The biography of Marlborough, which covers the whole of his life up until his departure for the continent in December 1712, is written in the style of a personal observer. Events in his life from the 1680's are described as though the writer was present as a witness. This was of course a common practice to create versimilitude but perhaps could point to a person close to the general as the author or at least collaborator in the writing of the book. In many of the critical episodes in his life the first-hand knowledge of the author is offered as testimony to the propriety of Marlborough's conduct. As these episodes are controversial ones, used by his enemies against him, one is inclined to believe that the work was written with the general's privity and advice and was intended to present his version of these events to confute his detractors (see pp. 13, 19, 50, 89 etc.). The dedication of the book clearly identifies one of the authors. The editor, in making the dedication to the Duke of Montagu, Marlborough's son-in-law, states: The following sheets are entitled to your Patronage on a double Account, both in Respect of their Subject, and of their Author. The First being the Recital of the Great Duke of Marlborough , your Grace's Father-in-Law's Actions; the Last, a Person, who, when living, was equally honor'd with his and your own Father's Friendship. Had not he left Orders to the contrary in his last Moments, which I am engag'd to obey, your Grace would have acknowledg'd with the rest of the World, that as no one was more intimate with both, in their closest Retirements, so no one was furnish'd with greater Abilities, as well as Opportunities, of doing Justice to the Characters which are here submitted to your Grace's Judgement, and the Perusal of the Publick: But since I am with-held from divulging that Name, which I could have have wish'd it had been allow'd me not to have kept secret, and which of it self would have transmitted these posthumous Remains to latest Posterity, 'tis humbly requested, that your Grace will give me Leave to make Use of Yours, in order to secure to them the just Rewards of Fame and Immortality- After some further commentary the writer proceeds to "give an Account of our Anonymous Author, so far as is consistent with the Promises I made him, when he consigned the Manuscript over to my Care, upon his Deathbed." He was a Person of Birth and Fortune, as may be seen by his Conversation with the Princes, whose lives he has undertaken, and the Knowledge he had, thro' the Means of it, of the last; and the Reasons that induced him to write these Memoirs, were occasion'd by the Veneration he had for the Noble Actions of one, and the profound Respect he bore to the good Services of the other. . . . The Compiler of these Memoirs, after he had been a strenuous Asserter of the Liberties of his Country, and the late General's Honour, fell sick, when he had well nigh brought them to a Conclusion; and finding that his Sickness would terminate in Death, put his Papers into my Hands, either to finish them, or dispose of them as I should think fit, under the Restraint beforementioned. This description refers to Marlborough's devoted friend and apologist, Arthur Maynwaring. Maynwaring's history need not be repeated here, though one regrets that no adequate account of his life has ever been written. 2 Born into a Tory landed family, he passed from study at Oxford and the Inns of Court into post-Revolution society under the patronage of the Earl of Dorset and the Duke of Somerset. A ready wit and gifted pen, lent first to Jacobite panegryics, were directed by his noble relations to the service of the Whigs. At the turn of the century he entered the government in a minor post under the Treasury and remained in office until his death. His celebrated conversation and wit, which gained him entrance into the Kit-Kat Club, gave him considerable prominence in his own day. His friendship with Lord Treasurer Godolphin and the Marlboroughs (he acted as a secretary and confidant to the Duchess) made him important politically, and he used his position to benefit his friends in the world of letters. As the fortunes of his distinguished friends declined, he devoted the remaining few years of his life to defending their actions and the ministry which they had headed, as journalist, pamphleteer and editor. His last service to Marlborough was to act as an intermediary with Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, then Lord Treasurer, to obtain a pass for the Duke that would permit him to go to the continent. He was often in ill-health in his last years and succumbed to a fatal chill on November 13, 1712. We know that he had had in hand a history of Marlborough's military exploits. He began this project as a narrative of the famous march to the Danube in 1704 which had resulted in the immortal battle of Blenheim. Maynwaring had been given an account of the expedition by Francis Hare, the chaplain-general of the army, who had accompanied the Duke. As was the case with several political tracts in defense of Marlborough which Hare subsequently wrote, Maynwaring had been "desir'd to alter and improve it, but being mightily pleas'd with the particular Account of all that past in that surprising March, he resolv'd it should not be lost, and to give it a new more perfect Form himself, by reducing a kind of Diary, into a regular History" ( Ibid ., p. 73). So we are informed by John Oldmixon, who collaborated with Maynwaring in the writing of the Medley , and published a biography of Maynwaring together with extracts from his writings. Oldmixon included a fragment of this work in his Life , as he did some other unpublished writings that he had obtained from Maynwaring's papers. Further corroboration of Maynwaring's involvement is to be found in those papers of his which survive in the muniments at Blenheim Palace. There is an autograph fragment of this narrative in his hand, which differs from that printed by Oldmixon, and may represent an earlier effort. The paper is indorsed by Maynwaring in these words. "I will endeavour to give some Account of the Duke of Marlboroughs Expedition to Germany." Then after a false start, "I write the Expedition," he commences: I have resolvd to write the Expedition of John Duke of Marlborough to Germany: A subject most worthy to be related of all that happened in the present war. And tho some men admire onely the Expeditions in times past, &amp; think no Actions of our age shou'd be compared to those of antiquity: yet if they wou'd consider the difficulty, the length &amp; the consequences of this March, they wou'd find [it] to be greater than Any that was made before it. What has onely been reported by some men who made the campayn, I shall very seldom mention, unless I have found their relations true, upon a strict and diligent Enquiry: What has been variously represented by Others, who are of different Parties &amp; inclinations, I shall wholly omit, least I shou'd fall into Error, or uncertainty: And I shall ground my Account upon a Dayly Register of matters of Fact faithfully made without Remarks or reflexions, by a Person [Hare] who was present at all the Undertakings, but who claimd no merit in the service or success, &amp; who neither had Envy nor Interest to gratify. 3 One can only guess what Maynwaring ultimately intended, but the fragment printed by Oldmixon suggests that he conceived of a history of the Duke's career, which he reshaped into a vindication following the disastrous turn of events in 1710 and 1711. The fragment in the Blenheim archives is important because: 1) it substantiates Oldmixon's story; 2) it demonstrates that Maynwaring intended to use Hare's unpublished journal as the basic source for his work; and 3) the tone of his remarks implies that he undertook this task some years after the campaign, when Marlborough's career as Captain-General was under attack. The full draft he composed, left uncompleted at his death, is undoubtedly the basis of The Lives of Two Illustrious Generals . If a portion of the Lives was written by Maynwaring, who completed it? The writer of the dedication, who also composed the balance of the work, does not identify the extent of his contribution. He only informs us that "I need not tell your Grace [Montagu], or the intelligent Reader, where that celebrated Author [Maynwaring] left off; That will be too soon discover'd by the Want of Stile and Method which displays it self in the Additions I have made to it." And he gives us only one clue to his own identity. In describing the virtues of Montagu, he states, "I could tell the World what A Gracious and Indulgent Creditor those that are in Arrears to You in the last, have found You, and give it to understand, from the Observations I have drawn from the Words of several of your Grace's Tenants, (whom I am now among, even while I am hastening this to the Press)." One might suspect that Oldmixon completed the work if one considers his close relationship to Maynwaring. Indeed Maynwaring appointed him as his literary executor and Oldmixon undertook the Life and Works as a fulfillment of Maynwaring's own intentions (Oldmixon, p. xii). Much to his chagrin, however, he was not permitted to complete the life of Marlborough. After Maynwaring's death, "these original papers [the drafts, and the manuscripts upon which it was based] have since fallen into the Hands of Mr. Steele, and no doubt they will be very useful to him in his History of the Duke's glorious campaigns" (p. 73). Oldmixon's testimony receives independent confirmation in an undated note from Maynwaring's sister, Grizel, to the Duchess of Marlborough, apparently written after Maynwaring's death. "Mr Nightingale hath deliver'd the Writings to me. They are in two small Trunks. I desire to know whether I shall send them by my servant, or that the Duke of Marl[borough] will rather choose to have them brought by any other person." It is indorsed by the Duchess: "Mrs Maynwaring's letter about the writings her brother had concerning the Duke of Marlborough" (Blenheim MSS, E29). These must be the "original papers" turned over to Steele, the "Manuscript" which was completed as The Lives of Two Illustrious Generals , and the "authentick Papers" from which Steele intended to write his History. The reference by the editor of the Lives to his status as a tenant of Montagu could well point to Steele. We know that Steele moved to Bloomsbury Square in the summer of 1712 and remained there for two years. The Duke of Montagu through his mother was a co-heir to the Southampton estates which included the manor of Bloomsbury. Though the Bloomsbury property had gone to his aunt, Lady Rachel Russell, his parents had bought a piece of land from her off the Square in 1675, where they built Montagu House. Most of the property in the Square and elsewhere in Bloomsbury was let on long leases and Montagu may well have acquired some of these or other interests in and around the Square through his family. 4 Montagu was an intimate of Steeles. The praise for Montagu's indulgence as a creditor could be Steele's way of acknowledging Montagu's generosity to him as his landlord. After Steele moved into Bloomsbury Square he passed through another of his regular financial crises and the Duke may well have suspended the rent or loaned him money to help him out of his difficulties. It is not unreasonable to presume then that Steele might have performed this last literary service for his friend. Both Montagu and Steele were members of the Hanover Club, to whose meetings Maynwaring was also invited. 5 They had also a longer acquaintance through the Kit-Kat Club, and thus were in frequent social contact. Steele was closely attached to Maynwaring. Maynwaring may have introduced him to Harley and thus obtained the job of Gazetteer for him ( Steele Corres. , p. 45on). Thereafter Maynwaring solicited Godolphin and the Marlboroughs on behalf of Steele for both a lodging in one of the Queen's houses and other offices under the crown. 6 Maynwaring shared his friend's happiness at the success of the Tatler , launched in April 1709, and recommended it enthusiastically to the Duchess, making reference to it on many occasions in his letters, and often adding explanatory comments. Although he was immediately pointed to as one of the possible authors of this venture it is difficult to find any direct evidence that he made contributions himself, though it is quite possible he did so ( Steele Corres. , p. 45on). He certainly lent his learning and advice, if not his pen to assist Steele and his great knowledge of classical writers may explain some of the profuse allusions to them in this periodical. On the one occasion where we have proof of his preparing a paper to be inserted in the Tatler , Maynwaring was constrained from doing so by the Duchess of Marlborough, to whom he sent the draft on 24 December 1709 with this explanation. I spent all this morning in writing a letter to the Tatler: taking occasion from what he says in his paper today that he intends to censure the great vices of our Age, and therefore I put him in mind of one that is the blackest of All, and of which there are flaming instances, I mean that of Ingratitude. I thought it better for him, to do it so in a letter, than to make it as if it were his own, because if any body should be angry at him for it, he may say it was sent to him, and he printed it as he does other letters that come to him he knows not from whom: And I shall not be at all concerned, if it should be thought to be mine. I will send it to your Grace before 'tis printed, or keep it till you come back: But it is not done yet as it should be, or I am afraid ever will ( Corres. of the Duchess , II, 286-7). There is an implication in this letter that he had prepared other pieces for the Tatler , but had written them in the person of Bickerstaff as did other contributors. The ingratitude of which he wrote was that of the Queen and Abigal Masham to the Duchess. She replied on the 27th: I am much obliged to your for the favour of your leter, and for remembering what I desired to write upon, the subject of Ingratitude, but I desire you will keep it till I come to town. . . . I believe I shall make noe use of it but to improve or entertain myself, for . . . tho 'tis done in the manner you mention if there is any thing that can reflect upon Abigal she will certainly endeavour to hurt the Tattler, which can only bee by taking away the pention [Steele's] and that I could easyly repair by giving him one my self but I have read Seneca to day and I think that mony may bee better bestowed then in puting a woman in print that is so well known and so contemptable as herself, and one may bee sure nothing can reforme her (Blenheim Mss. G1-4). Maynwaring acquiesced, 7 and held it for her return, but when he sent it to her on the first day of the new year, "so blotted, and indeed unfinished, as it is" he was still not without hope of obtaining her approval to insert it in the Tatler in amended form. "I complimented the Tatler so gravely, that no body might possibly think it to be his own. But if it signifies any thing to fright them [the Queen and Abigal] a little, a very short letter might be made out of this, onely to put him in mind of Ingratitude in General, without the Table, or any particular application: as I can easily show your Grace when I have the honour to see you." 8 Even this suggestion did not meet with her approval for there is no passage in the Tatler that meets this description. But Maynwaring's effort was not wasted for he revised the letter and published it later in the year as number five of the Medley . Maynwaring's daily routine, which he described to the Duchess on one occasion, sounds almost like that of Bickerstaff himself. "I shall certainly be found at home all day, except at White's before dinner, and at the coffee House by St. Jame's in the evening, where I shall go to read the news." 9 His steadfast support of Steele is manifest throughout the later years of his life. Steele's devotion to him is evident from his dedication of volume one of the Spectator . The Lives were completed after Maynwaring's death in November 1712. Steele terminated the Spectator at the end of 1712 and was unoccupied until March when he started the Guardian , whose first number appeared on the 12th. Thus he was free to devote up to three months to the completion of the Lives . But to say that Maynwaring composed the basic part of the Lives and that Steele may have completed it is not enough. A closer examination of the dual biography reveals that it includes portions of other works which help to shed some light on its composition. The Life of Marlborough, the first part of the work, was based by Maynwaring upon the materials of Hare, who was Marlborough's first biographer. 10 Hare had accompanied Marlborough on all his campaigns since that of 1704, when James Smallwood, his previous chaplain, had been forced to retire because of poor health. 11 Hare helped to prepare the official dispatches from Marlborough's headquarters which recounted the actions of his army, and his journal of the march to the Danube has been accepted as the basic source for all accounts of that famous expedition (Horn, p. 154ff.). Perhaps Maynwaring's close relationship with the Marlboroughs began upon this account, for the first printed account of the Blenheim campaign was put together in London by an unidentified person from materials sent over by Hare (Horn, p. 152). It could have been Maynwaring whose acquaintance with Godolphin dates from about this time. He spent the long vacation at Windsor in 1704 at a time when the Queen and her court were in residence. By 1706 he was already on familiar terms with the Duchess of Marlborough. 12 In any event Hare's life of 1705 and the apologia he composed in Marlborough's defence in 1712 13 all borrowed one from the other, and the Lives of Two Illustrious Generals is based in turn upon them. After the ministerial revolution of 1710 Hare wrote a number of other important tracts justifying the conduct of the late ministry and defending Marlborough's reputation. Besides writing a number of pieces himself, Maynwaring edited most of Hare's writing for the press. His share was so great that he may be reckoned a co-author, for Oldmixon tells us that "every line . . . was revised, and great alterations and improvements [were] made" by him (Oldmixon, p. 203). Many of these works found their way into the Lives . The life of Marlborough runs to 174 pages. Of these the first 126 pages appear to be Maynwaring's own creation, though he was indebted to Hare for many of the facts. The next portion (pages 127 to 150) which covers the peace negotiations of 1709 and 1710 is drawn in large measure from works composed by Hare and revised by Maynwaring: The Conduct ; 14 the Negotiations for a treaty of peace, in 1709 , (1711) part I 15 and part II; 16 and the Management of the war , part II. 17 All through the life there are sections which appear to be based upon Maynwaring's own observations, especially those parts which relate to the events of the winter months when Marlborough was in England. The pages devoted to Harley's betrayal and resignation in 1708 (pages 114-6) and Marlborough's advice against the impeachment of Sacheverell (page 142) are of this kind. They are of particular interest insofar as they may reflect Marlborough's own views. The balance of the life is a knitting together of speeches by Marlborough and passages which appeared in several contemporary prints. For example, the pages dealing with the campaign of 1711 include an account of the taking of Bouchain "sent me by a great officer amongst the Troops of Hanover" (page 156). This is part of the very same letter printed by Abel Boyer in the Political State of Great Britain for October 1711 as "A Letter from an Officer of the Confederate Army before Bouchain, to his Friend at the Hague." There is also an extended quotation from the Spectator (number 130). Where did Maynwaring leave off? One possibility is page 167. At this point the author relates that Marlborough had decided to leave the country, and just preceding he had included a fine panegyric to the General, which could have been intended as a conclusion. The paragraph is followed by a dash in the printed text, the only one of its kind I have discovered. Only seven more pages follow. These contain an account of Marlborough's departure and his reception on the continent and a few closing remarks. Maynwaring died just as Marlborough's pass was on the point of being issued. It is not unreasonable to assume that he had carried the narrative down to this point shortly before his death. A devoted friend completed the task for him. The life of Prince Eugene which follows has its own title page and frontispiece as does the life of Marlborough, though the whole is preceded by a joint title page and dedication. Moreover, the pagination of the text is continuous. The life of Marlborough ends on page 174, that of Eugene commences on page 175 and runs to the end of the volume (page 283). We have noted that Maynwaring used the works of Hare as a principal source. He or his editor followed a similar practice, but more slavishly for the life of Eugene. The work plundered is little known: The Life of Prince Eugene of Savoy ; Generalissimo of the Emperor's Army in Italy , "written originally in the German Tongue, translated out of that into French, and now into English," which appeared in 1702. 18 The publishers, Edward Castle and Samuel Buckley, noted that "the author promises another volume, which . . . will be more particular in the private passages of his life. When that is begun to be printed in either Germany or Holland, we shall be diligent to procure it, and oblige the Publick with a Translation of that by the same Hand that has done this." The first edition carried Eugene's life up to the battle of Cremona. The second edition appeared in 1707, this time under the imprint of Anita Baldwin. It consists of the 1702 life "with a continuation of his actions to the time of his being made governor of the Milaneze." 19 Eugene's life from birth through the events covered by the second English edition is transcribed almost verbatim into the 1713 Lives . The main difference lies in the fact that the later work abridges the earlier and supplies transition passages where sections are omitted. Moreover, the role of Eugene in the events described is glorified. For example, when Eugene's troops fell back on Catinat as he attempted to pass the Po in 1689, Eugene himself barely escaped an ambush and had to hack his way through forty dragoons to get to safety. The earlier life adds "Tis said, that had it not been for a Dragoon of his own Regiment, who kill'd a French Trooper that was taking aim at him, he had certainly fallen" (page 57). This passage is omitted in the Lives (page 192) and one is left with the impression that Eugene escaped without aid. At the siege of Belgrade in 1688, where Eugene served under the Elector of Bavaria, the Imperialists had trouble penetrating the fortifications to gain entrance to the town. According to the earlier life (page 42), they "got up to the Top of the Walls by the help of a House that was in the Ditch, while others discover'd a little Gate, by which they got into the Place . . . [43] The Elector himself was wounded in the Face with an Arrow as he mounted the Breach with Prince Eugene , and Prince Commerci ." The compiler of the Lives not only credits the entrance to Eugene but adds a few details to glorify his swashbuckling hero. The assault was made possible "by Means of the Prince's Discovery of a Place that opened a Passage into the Castle, and at the forcing of which the Elector himself was wounded in the Face by an Arrow, and his Highness of Savoy receiv'd a Cut thro' his Helmet by a Sabre, which he repaid, by laying him that gave it him dead at his Feet" (page 186). When the source work ends the scribe's inspiration also fails. The events of 1706, the last campaign in the second edition of the Life close on page 263 of the Lives . The writer passes over the Toulon expedition of 1707 as something too unfortunate and too well-known to recount. The campaigns of 1708-11 are similarly passed over with the excuse that they are covered in sufficient detail in the preceding Life of Marlborough. The two generals were in the field together during those years. Only Eugene's actions in 1712 are treated in any detail and the material for these must have been readily at hand through the Gazette and other newspapers, if not in the memory of the writer, for they were so recent. The life of Eugene and the book close with eulogy from "the inimitable Author of the Spectator" (number 340). We can conclude that the first half of the Lives of Two Illustrious Generals , the life of Marlborough, is almost wholly the work of Maynwaring, who relied heavily on the works of Francis Hare for his raw material and in many instances for the text itself. The second half, the life of Eugene, is taken almost wholly from the 1707 edition of the anonymous life first published in German and republished in French at the Hague. The editor or compiler who completed the Lives for the press did not sign his name to the work. To be sure the initials C. M. are appended to the dedication but one can not assume that they have any relation to the name of the editor. The only person in Maynwaring's acquaintance known to this writer to whom they might apply is Charles Montagu, Lord Halifax, a kinsman of the Duke of Montagu, and there is no evidence to connect him with this work. 20 Almost all political tracts (and this was one) published in the Augustan period appeared anonymously or with false initials or pseudonyms. When Steele published his Letter to Sir Miles Wharton in April 1713 he signed it "F. Hickes," and his most famous works bore such signatures as "Isaac Bickerstaff" and "Nicholas Ironside." Was Steele the writer who picked up where Maynwaring left off and finished his work? Of Maynwaring's participation we can be confident. Of Steele's we can not be so sure, though the circumstantial evidence is strong. His great devotion to Marlborough is too well-known to require description here. It was sufficiently strong to break up his friendship with Swift ( Steele Corres. , p. 71n). Steele was even closer to Maynwaring than to Swift. Both were men of letters and men of business. Steele owed his preferment to him and the ties of friendship strengthened through the Kit-Kat Club, and the adversities of their party and its leaders tend to single him out as a likely candidate. At this stage in his career Steele gave up the Spectator to understake a more political paper, the Guardian . Soon after, he sundered his ties to the Oxford ministry to stand for election to Parliament as a Whig candidate. His close association with Montagu, the dedicatee of the Lives , culminated in their collaboration on a great Whig procession on Queen Elizabeth's birthday in November, which caused their names to be regularly linked together in the common gossip ( Steele Corres. , p. 57n). The evidence points most convincingly to Steele and students of his work will do well to give the Lives a scrutiny it has not had in the past. At the very least Maynwaring's own share can be acknowledged, and another title can be added to the canon of this distinguished, though neglected Augustan.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Oldmixon and An Impartial Enquiry (1715) by Pat Rogers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the dispute between "physical" or "descriptive" bibliographers, and "compilative" or "enumerative" practitioners, one fact has been neglected. This concerns the descriptive bibliographer's bounden duty to examine with some care the internal content of any book under review. He may not be as anxious as his colleague to bring out the literary merits of the work he describes. But he is at least compelled to look at all parts of the literal object which is the book — not merely the outer dress, such as title-page or list of contents. As a result, he usually notices (if he does not actually mention, under the rubric of "Contents" for instance) substantial facts about the work which the ordinary compiler of checklists often fails to see. Occasionally, the circumstances affected by this consideration may extend even to the attribution of the book. Such is the present case. In June 1715 James Roberts brought out a work in reply to Mrs Manley's Conduct of the Duke of Ormonde . This was a quarto pamphlet, 48 pages in length, with the following title: An Impartial Enquiry into the Duke of Ormonde 's Conduct, in the Campagne of 1712. With a Plan of the Situation of the Confederate and French Armies when the Duke refus'd to Fight, as it was drawn on the Spot by General C---n ; and Remarks made thereon by Mr Maynwaring . The pamphlet is now in the Bodleian Library, unfortunately shorn of its "plan." 1 The omission is doubly unfortunate, in that no less a draughtsman than Herman Moll was responsible for the mapping. 2 We learn this from the entry in Bernard Lintot's Monthly Catalogue (II, 9) for June: An Impartial Enquiry . . . with Remarks thereupon. By Arthur Maynwaring, Esq, curiously engraved by Mr Moll. Printed for J. Roberts. pr. 1s. It will be observed that the Catalogue has extrapolated from the bare mention of "Remarks" on the title-page to an outright assumption that Maynwaring was the author of the whole. In this supposition the Catalogue has been followed by other compilations and lists, including W. T. Morgan's well-known Bibliography of works of historical interest. 3 Unfortunately, the real position is quite otherwise: and Lintot's entry is no less misleading for its contemporaneity — an advantage we must learn not to treat with exorbitant respect. The fact is that Maynwaring had died in 1712. The "Remarks" made by him are confined to the last couple of pages, and they are taken from a work already in print: perhaps twice over in print. This was The French King's Promise to the Pretender , which had appeared anonymously in 1712. 4 At some point in 1715 Oldmixon reprinted this piece in his Life and Works of Maynwaring (pp. 204-223). I do not know if that event predated the publication of the Impartial Enquiry : but it does not matter very much. There is abundant evidence that the last mentioned work was a completely fresh work, alluding in passing to observations of the dead Maynwaring — especially his comments on the map, which Cadogan had brought back in 1712 — and that his presence on the title-page can be explained as a bit of sales promotion. 5 Forgotten though the name may now be, it once held connotations of both authority and glamour. Indeed we can go much further than that. We can state, as a virtual certainty, that John Oldmixon wrote the Enquiry . I do not think anyone who had read much of Oldmixon, and then came on this pamphlet, would be in any doubt for a moment. However, a number of the major considerations are supplied here, in summary form. (1) Oldmixon was busy on behalf of Roberts at this time, having written at least half a dozen pieces for the bookseller in the past two years and standing poised to double this tally within the next two years. Incidentally, he had previously been the author of at least twelve books with the imprint of Ann Baldwin, who had been Roberts' predecessor at the shop in Warwick Lane. It is probable that all these numbers considerably underestimate Oldmixon's activity. He was assuredly Roberts' house author, as it were, in 1715. 6 (2) The author of the Enquiry introduces his citations with the phrase, "Mr Maynwaring asserts this to be true, and I can assure the Reader, that he knew as much of the matter as anyone . . ." (p. 48). No other writer could or would have so assured the public. Oldmixon is in fact the only professional writer of the age (I exclude men of the standing of Addison and Steele) whom we know to have been on terms of friendship with Maynwaring. He is the only author who champions Maynwaring after his death: and this he does in a succession of works, right up to the time of his own death in 1742. The claim made for Maynwaring's authority could be paralleled again and again in the pages of Oldmixon: nowhere else, so far as I know. Incidentally General Cadogan was one of Oldmixon's dedicatees. Memoirs of Ireland (1716) was addressed to him. (3) It was observed that Oldmixon reprints The French King's Promise in the Life , as Maynwaring's. This hitherto anonymous pamphlet had attracted no special notice outside that context. It is by no means clear that anyone except Oldmixon knew that it was by Maynwaring. (4) The entire contents of the pamphlet may be said to cry out "by John Oldmixon." The topics under review are his (the separate peace terms of Torcy and Mesnager: Pettecum's intervention: the merits of Marlborough, the former Captain-General) (pp. 4ff, 21, etc.). The polemical strategies are his: mock-modesty at the start, rhetorical questions, exclamatory phrases ("Here's a Scene . . .": "This upon my Word is Frankness with a Vengeance"), heavy irony ("this honest-hearted Secretary"), sneers at such "Eloquence" as Harley's encomium on Ormonde (pp. 3, 8, 42, 44 etc.). The objects of hatred are his: Mrs Manley, whose pen and person are said to be "equally Common and Mercenary;" 7 Sacheverell; Bolingbroke and Harcourt; " Abel and the Faction" (p. 3, 4, 19, 39-40). There is a thrust at the Tory "libellers," Swift, Foe, Oldsworth [sic] and Roper (p. 48). The terms employed are Oldmixon's: besides mercenary, faction, libellers, we have "Riotous Rabble ," " Lewdness and Scandal , Falsities and Invectives " (pp. 3, 4). There is the familiar contumely: "such a Creature" [as Arthur Moore]: there is Oldmixon's pet expression, "Gallicism" (pp. 5, 7, 44). 8 It hardly seems necessary to go on. What we have is a standard example of the pamphleteering craft of Oldmixon. It deals with his familiar topics in his familiar way, with praise (of Maynwaring) and blame (of many more) allotted as it is in a score of such items. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I have been unable to locate an intact copy of the work despite a search in major British libraries. The Bodleian copy, pressmark Pamph. 303 (27), measures 21cm. in height and collates A-F4. Following the title-page (verso blank), pages run 3-48. 2 Moll also supplied maps for Oldmixon's British Empire in America (1708). It is evident from the signatures and pagination that the engravings were separately inserted, and that no text is lost in the Bodleian copy. 3 Item R373 in W. T. Morgan, A Bibliography of British History 1700-1715 (1934-42). 4 Morgan lists two separate editions in 1712, item O415. 5 The circumstances in which Cadogan prepared his plan and Maynwaring added his comments are described in the Life of Maynwaring , p. 339. The author of the Conduct refers to Maynwaring as one who "knew as much of the matter as anyone" (p. 48) — note the tense. 6 Roberts' standing as a solid Whig figure is demonstrated by his appearance as an expert witness in the trial of John Matthews in 1718. Roberts and John Darby were called on to support the ministry's prosecution of a young printer for his part in issuing a Jacobite pamphlet. Cf State Trials , ed. T. B. Howells (1812), XV, 1354-1355. 7 The charge of "lewdness" is laid against Mrs Manley's Atlantis . It is sufficient to recall Oldmixon's later description of the same work — "a lewd Libel . . . written by a Strumpet too wicked for a Name in History." See his History of England (1735), p. 541. 8 For "Gallicism," cf. Oldmixon's Clarendon and Whitlock Compar'd (1727), p. vi. For Moore as a "Creature" of the chief ministers, see History (1735), pp. 517, 556. 9 The author of the Enquiry had evidently read the accounts of Clarendon's impeachment. Oldmixon's interest in this phase of history possibly went back to 1708, the year in which The Lives of All the Lord Chancellors appeared. It was intensified in years to come with Oldmixon's well publicized charge concerning the sophistication of the text of Clarendon's History . Oldmixon's did bring out one posthumous tract by Maynwaring, A Short Account and Defence of the Barrier-Treaty. By the late A.M. Esq. (1713). But the circumstances were different; the work had not previously been published, and was firmly labelled as Maynwaring's in the "Advertisement" (sig. A2 r ) and in the Life of Maynwaring , pp. 227-247.

      <field name="heading_text">Pope in Russian Translations of the Eighteenth Century by Leonid M. Arinshtein</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pope was perhaps the first writer of the English Enlightenment to become known to Russian readers. A Russian version of the Essay on Man , published at the University of Moscow as early as 1757, appeared before the first translations of Robinson Crusoe (1762-64), Gulliver's Travels (1772-73), Gay's Fables (1783), or even Paradise Lost (1777). Other dates only underline Pope's priority: Fielding (1766), Richardson (1787), Goldsmith (1786). 1 It is true that towards the end of the eighteenth century in Russia (as perhaps everywhere) the novels of Defoe, Swift, Fielding, and Sterne became more popular than Pope's works. Yet his reputation, especially in the '50's, '60's, and '70's — or in the early stage of Russian assimilation of the English Enlightenment — should not be underestimated. At least three of Pope's works — An Essay on Man, The Rape of the Lock , and Eloisa to Abelard — were translated into Russian as early as the '40's or early '50's. But for various reasons their publication was delayed. The case of the Essay on Man was the most dramatic. Because some circumstances of this translation were connected with the name of the great scholar and poet M. Lomonosov, it attracted the attention of Russian critics, 2 who have discovered fascinating details of the history of that translation, a full account of which has not heretofore been produced. Pope's poem, in which philosophical and moral principles are fused with a heliocentric view of the world, first caught the interest of scientists. A distinguished physicist, the Academician Georg-Wilhelm Richmann (a native of Germany), translated the poem into German in 1741 and presented the manuscript to his pupil, F. Ostermann, son of Count A. Ostermann, a prominent courtier and Richmann's patron. 3 This translation was made from a French prose version by Etienne de Silhouette, published in Amsterdam, 1736, and reprinted several times. 4 It should be observed that the first Russian translations of the Essay were also made from Silhouette's text. Richmann was an intimate friend of Lomonosov, who found the poem so impressive that during the early '50's he recommended it for translation to one of his best pupils, Nicholai Nikitich Popovsky, then a student at the University of Moscow. 5 Popovsky, who knew several European languages and was a gifted poet, felt quite willing to translate the Essay . Though he worked from Silhouette's prose, he himself wrote in verse. Lomonosov followed closely the progress of Popovsky's work; and in August, 1753, as soon as the first epistle was complete, he forwarded it to I. I. Shouvalov, Curator of the University and a prominent figure at court. In his covering letter Lomonosov wrote with obvious pride, "There is not a single line that I have corrected." At the beginning of 1754 Popovsky finished the whole translation, and Lomonosov presented it at once to Count Razumovsky, President of the Academy of Science. On March 28, Lomonosov informed Shouvalov of this event (Lomonosov, X, 505). Lomonosov's wish to enlist Shouvalov's support was only too well-grounded. It was not easy in those days to publish a book with progressive scientific or social ideas. Russian culture during the second half of the eighteenth century was mature enough to appreciate and absorb the great flow of Enlightenment ideas from France and England. But on its way to the forward-looking levels of Russian society this flow had to overcome the resistance of the Orthodox Church. Many a work became a source of friction between sympathizers with the Enlightenment and ecclesiastical censors — Paradise Lost and Young's Night Thoughts among them. Even works which passed the censor were sometimes prosecuted after publication. So late as 1887, Russian translations of certain moral and religious works were withdrawn from sale by the Moscow University bookshop, two of the titles being The Pilgrim's Progress and J. Hervey's Meditations . 6 Although the translation of the Essay took about a year and the printing was to take about half a year, over three years passed before permission for publication was granted. We cannot be sure who put the first obstacles in the book's way, but these were serious enough to keep the manuscript, though quite ready for print, out of sight for two years. It could have lain so even longer had not Shouvalov energetically interfered. On 19 August 1756 he dispatched the manuscript to the Holiest Synod (governing body of the Russian Orthodox Church), asking for permission to publish it. 7 Since ecclesiastical censorship was not required for secular works, the question arises why Shouvalov should have sent the manuscript to the Synod and not directly to the press. We can only suppose that the opposition to publication was so strong that even the favorite of the Empress could not have his own way. The echo of a dispute, obviously unfavorable for the Essay , can be noticed in the letter he addressed to the Synod; for he writes, among other things, that the book is delivered to them "to be given better consideration," and that he "asks for an edict that might permit [the book] to be published after its consideration," etc. (Synodic Papers, folios 1, 2). The Synod took up the issue immediately. The minutes reveal that the reading began on August 23, when the first epistle of the Essay was discussed; the remaining epistles were discussed on August 27 (folios 3, 4). As a result, the ecclesiastical censors suppressed Popovsky's version, giving the following reasons: "The author of the book draws his ideas neither from Holy Writ nor from the canons of our Orthodox Church, forming all his opinions on the ground of natural ideas only, and in addition accepting the system of Copernicus as well as the doctrine of the plurality of worlds, which is absolutely in discord with Holy Writ . . ." (folio 6). In their verdict the Synod even listed the lines declared to be questionable. On September 19 the manuscript was returned to Shouvalov and the Synod's decision, was conveyed to him viva voce (folio 7). But Shouvalov did not stop there. As is clear from the Synod's records, he had Archbishop Amvrosy, a man of consequence in the Synod, invited to the royal court, 8 and asked him to alter the "questionable" lines himself. Amvrosy agreed; and on 27 February 1757 the Archbishop reported that he had received the manuscript from Shouvalov and, at the latter's request, had made the necessary corrections, leaving no room — as he put it — for anything that concerned "either the plurality of worlds, or the system of Copernicus, or naturalism." 9 With all the sore points thus removed from Popovsky's version by Amvrosy, the Synod at last gave their imprimatur to the translation. An edict "by Her Majesty the Empress Elizabeth and the Holiest Synod" ruled that the text should be published with the archi-episcopal interpolations (folios 11-12). Having secured the long-awaited license, Shouvalov wasted no time getting the book out. Printing began even before the official text of the edict reached the University. 10 In the archives of Moscow University are preserved Shouvalov's orders to the University press, which reveal that the curator personally supervised the printing, seeing to every minor problem — choice of type face, design of engravings and cover, distribution of copies. 11 The book was already in print when it became clear that the literary merits of the Archbishop's interpolations were slight. Popovsky's version was in syllabic-accentual meter (then new in Russian versification), while Amvrosy slipped now and then into the old syllabic meter. "In the Synodic version," Shouvalov wrote, "a number of verses have not a proper cadence. Therefore, Popovsky should be told to change the order of the words somehow, so as to make good verses without altering their sense" ( Documenty , I, 58). To this Popovsky, now a University Professor of Eloquence, retorted, "Without changing the sense it is impossible to give them proper cadence" (I, 62). Refusing pointblank to emend Amvrosy's lines, Popovsky got permission instead for the interpolations to be printed in a larger type than his own text! In this form the first edition appeared, December, 1757, under the title, " Opyt o Cheloveke Gospodina Pope [ Essay on Man by Mr. Pope]. Translated from French by Nicholai Popovsky in 1754." 12 While this edition was still in print, Shouvalov expressed his hope "that the first impression will soon be sold out and the second will perhaps appear in its original form without the corrections" ( Documenty , I, 93). The hope was not fated to be realized: three years after the Essay was published, Popovsky died at the age of thirty It is hardly surprising that all subsequent editions (Moscow, 1763 and 1787; Jassy, 1791; Moscow, 1802) appeared with the censorial distortions. Yet Popovsky's original version circulated in spite of the interdiction. One piece of evidence is a copy of the second edition, now in the State Public Library in Leningrad. This copy has a manuscript insert to page 24 (obviously written in the eighteenth century) that contains the verses condemned by the censor. The edition of 1791 deserves a brief remark. In the days of the Turkish campaign the small Roumanian town of Jassy became the residence of Prince Potemkin, the Russian commander-in-chief and favorite of Catherine II. The translation of Pope was published at Potemkin's field press, an event suggesting that such works as the Essay enjoyed a degree of esteem among the higher echelons of the Russian army. At nearly the same time another translation of the Essay , also from the French, was made by Ivan Fedorovsky, then a university student. There are indications that this prose version, which has never been printed, 13 was made about 1754-56. By his teachers Fedorovsky was not considered a good translator. A formal report by G. F. Miller to the office of the Academy of Science (17 June 1754) mentions him among undergraduates and masters "who have not sufficient skill in translation." 14 True, Fedorovsky's version is inferior to that of Popovsky both in precision and in literary merit; and this may be why it remained unpublished. While working on his translation, Fedorovsky probably knew nothing about Popovsky's. Perhaps on reading that, he gave up the idea of publication. At any rate, there is no sign that he tried to have his own version printed. About the turn of the century two other prose translations of the Essay were made, this time directly from the English original. They were by F. Zagorsky (Moscow, 1801; pp. 133) and E. A. Bolhovitinov (Moscow, 1806; pp. 112); the latter included a philosophical commentary. In the course of sixty years, therefore, five versions of the Essay were produced in Russia (the first being in German); and the best of these — Popovsky's — ran into five editions. It is clear that Pope, as author of the Essay , must have been fairly well known. In an essay of 1762 on English poetry, G. G. Domashnev, a nineteen-year-old student who was eventually to become Director of the Academy of Science, discussed Pope immediately after Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton. Analyzing the Essay , Domashnev observes that it "shows in the best way the importance and depth of moral admonition so characteristic of the English manner." 15 Epigraphs from the Essay were used on the title-pages of the first four numbers of Karamzin's Moscow Journal (1791), as well as in an article published by another Russian journal, Utrennie Chasy [Morning Hours], I (1788), 33. Works by other authors that seemed close in subject to the Essay were sometimes attributed to Pope. This was the case with a translation from the French of the Essay on Human Life , first published anonymously in London, 1734. In Russia, as well as in some French editions, this appeared as Pope's work, although the author was Paget Thomas Catesby. 16 The history of other translations of Pope is less dramatic. Even earlier than the Russian version of the Essay on Man , two prose versions of The Rape of the Lock were produced, 1748 and 1749. The first was an anonymous translation from the French of the comtesse de Caylus ( Les Cheveux enlevées , Paris, 1728). This was published by the Moscow University press in 1761, or thirteen years after it was made; and it was reprinted in 1788. The second version, by I. V. Shishkin, 17 has never been published. It has a rather extraordinary foreword, written in 1749, before any Russian translation of Pope was in print: Mr. Pope is a famous English poet. He is well known among lovers of reading. This poem is his creation, translated by me for the pleasure of my benefactor . . . although my translation is incomparable with the original, and if Mr. Pope reads his poem in Russian while in the abode of the dead, it is only by force of the rules [i.e., of that place] that he will refrain from giving me a beating. Still I firmly believe that my good will can be of use to those who don't know the foreign language. Let the reader be indulgent to me. 18 This foreword shows that as early as 1749 Pope was known in Russia, though through French translations. It is also plain that Shishkin did not intend to publish his translation. Indeed, it has so many omissions and inadequacies that one can sympathize with Shishkin's misgivings as to the effect it might have on Pope. The weakness of both this and the 1748 translation may account for the failure of The Rape of the Lock to win more popularity in Russia. 19 Far more popular were the translations of Eloisa to Abelard , which ran into more editions than the translations of any other work by Pope, including the Essay . The first translation of Eloisa , anonymous and in verse, was made during the 1750's. In his foreword to one of the later editions, the translator said he completed the work in 1755 but it seemed immature, and therefore he was in no hurry to publish it. However, the piece was published without his permission "among some tales." By this he must have referred to a voluminous Russian translation of Mme. de Gomez's Les Cent nouvelles nouvelles [ Sto Novyh Novostei , St. Petersburg, 1765], the first volume of which includes a translation of Eloisa 20 close to that of the anonymous writer. The revised form of the anonymous translation was published together with a Russian translation of Charles-Pierre Colardeau's elegy Armide à Renaud under the title Iroida [Elegy] i : Eloiza ko Abelyaru. Iroida ii : Armida ko Rinoldu . In this book no information is supplied as to the author's or translator's name, the language from which the translation was made, the date of publication, or the press. I. N. Medvedeva attributes the translation to D. M. Sokolov on the ground that when it was reprinted in a periodical, it directly followed a poem signed by Sokolov. 21 In our opinion this argument is not strong: works by one poet can follow those of another in a periodical; besides, this was not a first publication. The translator's name remains undertermined. The reference to Gomez's book establishes that the edition in question could not have appeared before 1765; and this fact bears on the very difficult problem of deciding whether the translation was made immediately from the English original or from a French version. The Russian text seems about as close to Pope's own language as to the French of A.-A.-J. Feutry ( Epître d'Héloïse à Abailard . . . mise en vers par M. Feutry ). The latter appeared in 1751; so even if the Russian translation was produced so early as 1755, it could have been based on the French. Medvedeva says it was "undoubtedly made directly from the English" but gives no evidence to support the assertion (see note 21 above). On the other hand, Svodny Katalog Russkoi Knigi XVIII Veka maintains — again without offering reasons — that the anonymous translation was made from the French (II, 447). Offhand, this would seem more likely if only because during the 1750's translations of English works were far more commonly derived from French versions than from the originals. Yet some support for the theory of direct translation appears in a later reprint of the anonymous Russian text, the preface to which contains a reference to the English poem: "It partly follows the English original, partly is fully borrowed from the latter" ( Novye Ezhemyesyachnye Sochineniya , III [1786], 79). In the context of the preface, unfortunately, one cannot determine whether "it" refers to the Russian translation or to Feutry's! As if to complicate the problem further, the anonymous author continued to work on his translation up to the time of its reappearance in the late 1760's; and in the interval a new French version of Eloisa appeared, by Colardeau: Lettre amoureuse d'Héloise à Abailard, traduction libre de l'anglais de M. Pope , 1758. The anonymous author could hardly have overlooked this, since Colardeau also produced his own poem, Armide à Renaud, héroide imitée du Tasso , which was immediately translated into Russian, probably by the same anonymous author ( Polyeznoye Uvyesyelyenie , no. 11, January, 1760, pp. 113-119); and, as indicated above, the publication of both works in one volume followed a few years later. Examining the anonymous translation of Eloisa , one discovers a number of lines that seem close to Colardeau's text. It is likely, therefore, that the author made use of at least two of the possible sources (Pope and Feutry, or Feutry and Colardeau), if not of all three. Such a hypothesis would account for the parallels between the Russian, the English, and the two French texts, and would also account for other obscurities. The same anonymous version, slightly revised again, was published in a periodical: Modnoye Yezhemyesyachnoe Izdanie [Fashionable Monthly], I (1779), 83-97; another periodical: Novye Yezhemyesyachnye Sochineniya [New Works, Monthly], III (1786), 78-103; and an almanac: Sobranie Noveishih Pyesen [Collection of New Songs] . . ., Moscow, 1791, I, 152-166. In the early 1780's a prose translation of Eloisa was made by L. Dmitriev and included in his collection of the letters of Abelard and Héloise. 22 The next translation was that of Vladislav Ozerov, a well-known poet and playwright. 23 This was the first poetic work of a young man. Ozerov may have believed that Colardeau and not Pope wrote the original poem; at any rate, he never mentioned the name of the author in his foreword. He also knew of the earlier anonymous translation and respected it, for he said, "The maker of that [translation], who is unknown to me, either translated the same epistle but by another author, or made a large number of alterations. I see pictures there that surpass my descriptions, but on the whole it is rational rather than emotional" (p. 3). With this remark he indicates the difference between the rational style characteristic of Pope and Feutry, and the pathetic-sentimental style of Colardeau, which is like his own. At the turn of the eighteenth century several other versions of Eloisa to Abelard appeared. Among these were an anonymous translation of L.-S. Mercier's imitation of Pope 24 and a translation of lines 1-72 by the great Zhukovsky. 25 It seems that Pope's authorship of Elosia became obvious only in 1816, when V. M. Protopopov published a number of parallel translations of the poem in a single volume. He included translations from the English original as well as from French imitators and translators — Colardeau, Saurin, and Feutry. 26 Yet another poem by Pope that appeared comparatively early in Russian translation is — unexpectedly — The Temple of Fame , made into good Russian verse by the famous Michail Matveevich Kheraskov and published in 1761 by the Moscow University press. Nearly thirty years later Pavel L'vov produced a version of the same descriptive poem in prose. 27 During the 1760's and '70's new translations of Pope came to a halt while those made in the 1750's were reprinted. In the '80's a new wave of interest in Pope started. Now it involved his sentimental and religio-meditative poems, such as The Messiah , The Universal Prayer , and some other minor works of this kind.

Two of these were incorporated into the famous Letters of a Russian Traveller , by N. M. Karamzin: a verse translation of Windsor Forest , ll. 171-218, and a prose translation of the Epitaph for One Who Would Not Be Buried in Westminster Abbey . (See the Letters , VI, Moscow, 1801, pp. 191-195 and 357.) At the very beginning of the nineteenth century two more works by Pope were translated: Prologue to Mr. Addison's Tragedy of Cato , a prose translation in Ipokrena , VIII (1801), 91-93; and An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot , translated from the French by I. I. Dmitriev. 29 At last, An Essay on Criticism was translated in verse by Prince Sergei Shihmatov and published in 1806. 30 This translation marks the decline of Russian literary interest in Pope. The flow of Romantic poetry, followed by realistic novels, reduced the appeal of the poet of the Enlightenment, who never again rose to an influential position in Russia.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Composition and Revision of Coleridge's Essay on Aeschylus' Prometheus by S. W. Reid</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some thirty years ago Sir Edmund Chambers conjectured that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1825 lecture on Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound included material prepared in 1821 for his son Hartley. 1 To support his conjecture, Chambers referred to the substantial, but inconclusive, external evidence of the letters of 16 May 1821, 26 April 1825, and 19 May 1825. 2 Yet, documents recently brought to light make Chambers' reasonable guess convincing indeed, and it is the purpose of this article to show that the 1821 transcription of the essay originally written for Hartley was revised by Coleridge in 1825, and is the chief ancestor of the text of the 1825 lecture published in the Royal Society of Literature's Transactions and later in Coleridge's Literary Remains . The evidence consists of two manuscript fragments, one of thirteen leaves and the other of two. The first of these, now in the Duke University Library, has hitherto been catalogued as "a collection of MS. notes on philosophical subjects by S. T. Coleridge"; the second fragment is two leaves of Notebook 29, otherwise known as the "Clasped Vellum Notebook," now in the Berg Collection of The New York Public Library. The thirteen leaves at Duke and the two leaves in New York apparently were once together in Notebook 29, and reunited they contain the complete text of the essay as it was prepared for Hartley in 1821. The Duke manuscript contains not only the major part of the essay in its early form but also the revisions made by Coleridge for his lecture in 1825. Its thirteen leaves are gathered in quires of two (conjugate) leaves each; thus the manuscript is constituted of six gatherings plus a disjunct leaf, folio 1. The watermark reads eads &amp; pine 1802. The leaves, unnumbered, are roughly bound in a coarse brown paper. According to the records of the library's manuscript division, they arrived at Duke in this wrapper when the manuscript was purchased; this information is verified by the fact that mathematic equations which appear on the wrapper in Coleridge's hand were included in the prefatory remarks which he wrote for the 1825 lecture. 3 Folio 1 recto contains the words 'Mr John Anster | 30 Thornhaugh Street | Bedford Square' in Coleridge's hand in the upper right corner. 4 Across the page are the words 'by the Author, S. T. Coleridge' apparently in the hand of Joseph Henry Green, Coleridge's amanuensis. 5 The main text, in Green's hand, begins at the top of folio 1 verso and continues to the bottom of folio 13 verso. The last sentence is incomplete. Revisions in ink and in pencil in Coleridge's hand occur throughout the manuscript up to the last third of folio 11 recto, where a new paragraph in the main text begins. Two other scraps of evidence, both uninformative, deserve mention: one, a sentence about the document on the wrapper in an unidentified hand, and the other, a brief description of the document in the hand of J. Dykes Campbell on a separate sheet that has been kept with the manuscript. Inscribed in Green's hand upon two leaves of Notebook 29 in the Berg Collection of The New York Public Library is the remainder of the essay. This notebook was kept by Coleridge from 1814 to 1825, according to the Berg Collection's records. As customarily, Coleridge turned the book around when he had filled about half its pages, and consequently the text in question begins at the top of folio 118 verso with a fragment of a sentence, continues on 118 recto, and ends at the bottom of 117 verso. There is no inscription on these pages in any hand but Green's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The evidence is unequivocal for concluding that these two leaves of Notebook 29 provide the continuation and completion of the incomplete text of the unrevised essay contained in the Duke manuscript. For example, the crucial sentence fragments (the one at the end of the Duke manuscript and the other at the beginning of the Berg) constitute a coherent sentence when joined together. Beyond this quite substantial evidence, there are the facts that Nature, the subject of the Berg pages, is clearly the subject of the final Duke pages and that the general theme of the essay is carried to its conclusion in the Berg pages. And conclusive evidence is found in the physical properties of the documents. Besides what one would normally expect — the facts that the documents match in their papers, in their formats, and in the general spacing of the inscriptions made by Green — one piece of physical evidence clearly indicates that the Duke pages formerly were bound in Notebook 29 just before folio 118. For between folios 119 and 118 a conspicuous separation in the binding of the book occurs. From the fragments of paper clinging to the binding thread at this point, one plainly must conclude that leaves have been torn out of the book. These fragments belong to one and the same gathering of two leaves, and they adhere to the 119 side of the break. Naturally, one would look for the mates of these fragments in the initial leaves of the Duke manuscript. As previously noted, the initial Duke leaf is disjunct. Furthermore, it has been trimmed along its gutter edge in a straight line, and, as a result, it measures 7¾ inches from this inner edge to the outer edge. But all other leaves of both the Duke manuscript and the notebook measure 8 inches. Thus, the initial Duke leaf wants ¼ inch, and it is no accident, certainly, that ¼ inch is the exact width of the largest fragments adhering to the binding of Notebook 29. It is safe, therefore, to assume that the Duke leaves were once bound in Notebook 29 between the folios now numbered 119 and 118, and that they were torn out and rebound after the entire essay had been copied into the notebook. For the word 'by' on the first page was covered when the leaves were rebound, and it is not at all likely that a certain number of leaves were first torn out, the essay subsequently copied onto them, and the copying continued on the succeeding leaves yet part of the book. We may conclude, then, that Green transcribed Coleridge's essay into Notebook 29 and that either he or Coleridge failed to extract folios 118 and 117 when tearing out the thirteen leaves. These leaves were thereupon bound as a unit. The continuation and completion of the text of these leaves is provided by the pages remaining in Notebook 29; the entire extant document of the essay in its early form — as conceived by Coleridge and transcribed by Green in 1821 — has now been recovered. Unfortunately, it is not quite as apparent that this early form of the essay was composed in 1821 to aid Hartley in writing his poetic adaptation of Prometheus Bound , for we have no manifest proof that it was. Although second-person pronouns appear, Hartley is not addressed by name in the manuscript, and neither he, his father, nor anyone else whose mere word might have sufficed has identified this particular manuscript with the essay reportedly written for Hartley in or around May 1821. However, the evidence which does exist suggests strongly that this essay and our manuscript are identical. We know, for instance, that the transcription of the essay must have been made between November 1817, when Coleridge met Green, and early 1825, when Green ceased acting as amanuensis for Coleridge. 6 It is not likely, therefore, that Green made the transcription for the 1825 lecture. Nor, to take another tack, is it likely that Coleridge composed the essay prior to 1819. Before this year there is no mention of a composition on Aeschylus' Prometheus , whereas Coleridge's 1818 letters abound with references to the work on the two courses of lectures of 1818 and the revision of The Friend . This evidence, then, indicates that the essay in its earlier form was composed and transcribed sometime after 1818 but before early 1825. Other evidence points more precisely to a probable date of composition and transcription. The letters of Hartley and of his father reveal that in early 1820 Hartley was contemplating a translation of Aeschylus in which the Prometheus , he wrote, would "serve as a sort of text, for some observations on the sacerdotal religion of Greece, and on the sources and spirit of mythology." 7 Hartley's project was to be entered in competition for the prize essay at Oriel. Greek drama was on Coleridge's mind also, and he mentioned specifically Hartley's and his own work on an essay dealing with the prosody of the Greek dramatists, though he seems to have supported the Prometheus project as well. 8 These plans were upset, of course, by the dismissal of Hartley from Oriel in the spring of 1820, ostensibly on account of his unscholarly ways and his weakness for drink. By August 1820, his father had settled him with Basil Montagu in Bedford Square. There he was to continue his work on Greek drama. Though Coleridge continued for a while to concentrate on the essay on prosody, 9 Hartley's interests turned him in the direction of a poem based on Aeschylus' Prometheus , and on 19 February 1821 he wrote to his brother Derwent, "Prometheus prospers" ( Letters of Hartley Coleridge , no. 18). Apparently it did indeed prosper, for according to Derwent the poetic fragment was a principal occupation during Hartley's stay in Bedford Square and had been completed virtually, though perhaps not in every detail, by May 1821, before Coleridge wrote his essay on the metaphysics of Aeschylus' tragedy. 10 Derwent's testimony is confirmed by Coleridge's own remarks on the subject. He wrote to Derwent in a letter postmarked 16 May 1821: H. has the noblest subject that perhaps a Poet ever worked on — the Prometheus — and I have written a small volume almost to him, containing all the materials and comments on the full import of the most pregnant and sublime Mythos and Philosopheme . . . . But I should be happy to see your Brother more totus in illo, and [am] almost afraid, that as the materials accumulate and the Plan becomes large and circular, his Passion has cooled ( Unpublished Letters , no. 316). Set beside this statement, the words of the manuscript immediately following the point where the revisions cease and where the lecture ends take on substantial significance. I contemplate this venerable Mythos as a philosopheme with genial awe, &amp; as the subject of a Poem by you , a tragic Drama, which in the language of the first reviewers of the Drama in the middle ages might be appropriately entitled Prometheus, or Nous Agonistes . . . . 11 Clearly the essay in its early form was composed for someone close to Coleridge who was writing a poem the "subject" of which was Aeschylus' Prometheus ; 12 clearly his father knew that Hartley was writing a poem on this subject at this time. Moreover, it is evident that the manuscript additionally fits the description that Coleridge gave of his essay: the accumulated materials amount to "a small volume almost" on the subject, in short the sum of all my Reading and reflection on this vast Wheel of the Mythology of the earliest and purest Heathenism . . . . With his poetry I have had no concern, of course — but have simply brought together such stuff, as the Poet must have sought for in Books . . . ( Unpublished Letters , no. 316). As a matter of fact, these accumulated materials seem to have crippled the wings of Hartley's Pegasus, as Coleridge himself intimates, 13 and indeed Derwent, who was kept informed throughout of the project and was at Highgate with Coleridge and Hartley in the summer of 1821, affirms that the views of the Prometheus expressed in Coleridge's lecture are identical with those which in May 1821 discouraged Hartley's poetic efforts. 14 Since, as will be indicated shortly, the manuscript contains the germ and much of the substance of the lecture, Derwent's affirmation is plainly tantamount to an identification of the essay of 1821 with that of the manuscript at Duke. Whether or not the manuscript at Duke was the very one given to Hartley is another matter. The evidence is not conclusive but indicates that it was. Coleridge's principal aim was to present Hartley with the "small volume," and the manuscript appears to be just that. The first page, containing the words 'by the Author, S. T. Coleridge' but no text, gives the effect of a title page, and had the purpose of Green's transcription been to preserve a copy of the essay in the notebook for Coleridge's use, it is unlikely that the text would have been begun on the second page and that Green would have identified the author. The wrapper, which contains Coleridge's inscription of equations that later became part of the lecture ( Works , p. 347), had certainly been added to the manuscript by the time Coleridge revised it. Presumably Coleridge, accidentally overlooking the final two leaves of the essay, tore out the Duke leaves, had them bound, handed the manuscript to Hartley in 1821 during one of his visits to Highgate, and in late 1822 repossessed the manuscript before Hartley left London for a teaching position in the Lake Country. All that we know, then, points to the conclusion that the leaves at Duke and those at the Berg Collection constitute the "small volume" written for Hartley in 1821.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III This early form of the essay was revised by Coleridge for his lecture before the Royal Society of Literature in 1825. A comparison of the manuscript with the printed lecture reveals that the text of the personal essay formed the basis of the public lecture and that this second and final form of the essay incorporated most of the holograph revisions in the Duke manuscript. Not only did almost all of these alterations turn up in the text of the lecture, but the undeleted text of the essay also became part of the text of 1825. One would not wish to have to argue in each of these cases of agreement between the substantive readings of the manuscript and of the lecture that the lecture's reading originated independently of the very same form in the manuscript. When Coleridge stated at the end of the lecture that he could "trace the persecutions, wanderings, and migrations of the Io, the mundane religion" in a "future communication," he was no doubt thinking of the passage on this very subject in the unpublished part of his earlier text. 15 Both the lecture and the holograph revisions in the manuscript terminate at the end of the tenth section. It may even have been the relatively extensive personal reference to Hartley in the first sentences of the following section which made Coleridge decide to put a stop to his discourse at this point. In short, there is every reason to believe that Coleridge revised the initial text of the manuscript and then made it the main body of his lecture for the Royal Society of Literature, and the utter lack of evidence of Coleridge's attention to the essay at any time other than during the composition of it and the use of it for the lecture obliges us to conclude that the revision was undertaken specifically for the purpose of the lecture. Two distinct stages of revision in the manuscript can be identified. Most of the alterations are in a dark ink, and these occur on folios 1 verso through 11 recto. Some alterations in pencil followed these on a few pages (folios 2 verso through 4 recto, 9 recto, and 11 recto). Of this order there is one piece of evidence that alone practically constitutes demonstration. It involves the only instance of revision in which the very same change has been made in both ink and pencil. On folio 2 verso, Coleridge in ink has mended a 't' to a 'T', but in doing so he has not made the new inscription very legible; at the same place he has satisfactorily traced another 'T' in pencil. Evidently Coleridge thought the inscription in ink not sufficiently clear and therefore sought to improve it by retracing it. Fortunately, the inference that the alterations in ink were made before those in pencil is supported by other evidence in the manuscript. For example, in one case considerable alteration in pencil is interrupted at a passage which has been deleted during revision in ink, and in another certain elements of a passage have been altered in ink, and the whole passage, specifically including some of these alterations, has later been marked in pencil for revision. 16 In addition to the revisions contained in the manuscript itself, more extensive alterations and new passages must have been written out on other sheets and combined with the revised manuscript text in a fair copy which was turned over to the Royal Society of Literature. Coleridge had accepted appointment to the Society in March 1824, but he apparently did most of the work on the lecture in early 1825. On 8 April he was busy with the text but envisioning completion of his task, and two and one half weeks later he was finished ( Unpublished Letters , 333, 345, 346; Letters , II, 737-738). Delightedly aware of its difficulties, he delivered the lecture on 18 May 1825 (see Unpublished Letters , 351; Letters , II, 739-740). It has long been thought that the lecture was printed at this time and that at least one copy of this earliest edition survived. These suppositions are based on T. J. Wise's statement in A Bibliography of the Writings in Prose and Verse of Samuel Taylor Coleridge that a "Private Edition was printed and circulated in the customary manner, in advance of the reading" and upon his description of a copy of that "Edition" once in his possession and now in the British Museum. According to Wise, only twenty-five copies were printed. 17 No external evidence has ever been advanced to support Wise's assertion. 18 But internal evidence gained by collating the issue of the lecture described by Wise as a "Private Edition" and the alternate issue of the lecture in the Society's Transactions (1834) proves that Wise's statement is false. 19 Collation of the two issues of the lecture on the Hinman Collating Machine revealed, first of all, the fact that the pages throughout the lecture were printed from the same setting of type. In addition, I noted a number of aberrations such as would only arise from broken or worn type, and I found no textual variants. These findings clearly can lead to only one conclusion: the two issues of the lecture, printed from the same type setting, are distinct and distinguishable impressions and issues of the same edition printed contemporaneously. The Yale copy of the lecture (as well as Wise's description of this issue) reveals that the essay was at one point printed as a discrete unit, beginning with B1 and continuing through D3 (quarto); on the other hand, when issued in the Society's Transactions , the essay began on 3C2 verso and ended on 3E4 verso. Since the lecture was printed from variant impositions, standing type — and not stereotype plates — must have been used in printing the second issue. It is, of course, preposterous to assume that the type of this lecture was kept standing over a period of eight years. Hence we must conclude that both issues of the lecture were set up and printed in early 1834. There is really no evidence for any further conclusions, such as the order of these issues through the press. Aberrations of the kind referred to above are almost all identical, and those few that vary in one edition or the other constitute conflicting evidence supporting one order of printing as much as the other. Of course, it might be argued that the lack of evidence of deterioration itself tends to point to the "Private Edition" of twenty copies as the one with priority, but such negative evidence is of a low order of probability indeed and fortunately does not have to bear any textual weight, since there are no textual variants at stake. All we can say is that one issue, possibly the private one, was set up and printed not earlier than the first months of 1834 and that thereupon the type pages were re-imposed to print the lecture for alternate issue. The details of the composing, transcribing, revising, and printing of Coleridge's lecture are now before us, and the complete essay in its early form has now been recovered. We have traced the essay from Coleridge's composition in May 1821 for Hartley, through J. H. Green's transcription in Notebook 29 and his or Coleridge's oversight of folios 118 and 117 when extracting the Duke leaves, to Coleridge's revision of this bound "small volume" in 1825 for his Royal Society of Literature lecture. The printing of the lecture in 1834 closes the history of the producing of the essay in its authoritative forms, and there now remains the task of editing the authoritative documents for publication. When publication of both versions appears, it should allow us to view one of our great nineteenth-century writers developing an idea over a span of years, explicating and revising his explication of one of his favorite topics, the Prometheus myth.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Sources of the Essays in Robert Walsh's Didactics by Guy Woodall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Walsh (1784-1859), highly influential conductor of the Philadelphia National Gazette and Literary Register and of the American Quarterly Review , relinquished his editorial offices in the opening months of 1836. The first of these journals, a tri-weekly newspaper, he had edited since 1820; the second, a high quality literary review, since 1827. The commencement of Walsh's career as a public journalist, however, may be dated back to 1803 when he became a respected contributor to Joseph Dennie's Port Folio . 1 It was from his vast journalistic store that Walsh compiled his significant collection of essays under the title of Didactics : Social , Literary , and Political . 2 The Didactics was a notable achievement of Walsh's mature years. Published at the end of his long and illustrious editorial career, it can be considered as his nunc dimittis and final word on social, literary, and political matters which he had discussed in journals, mainly his own, over a period of thirty years. He assembled the material for the work during a severe illness in late 1835 and early 1836. The work was put to press on February 2, 1836, and bore a dedication to Dr. J. K. Mitchell, a well-known Philadelphia physician, who had tended him during his sickness. In an "Advertisement" in the first volume (pp. vii-ix), Walsh explained that he had undertaken the work at the insistence of Carey, Lea and Blanchard, publishers, who had wanted him to select from his works "articles of practical sentiment and literary reference" for publication. The articles that he selected, so he explained, were the products of his pen that dated back to 1810. They were originally contained in inedited manuscripts, articles for reviews, pamphlets, and a fifteen-years' file of his newspaper. He further explained that the essays had been reinforced with copious quotations not for pedantic reasons but to attract the attention of American youth to "standard writers of the old school" (I, vii-viii). Since Walsh left no record of the dates of the compositions and the journals in which they were originally published, scholars using the Didactics have had to content themselves with less bibliographical information than they desired. Upon reviewing the Didactics shortly after it appeared, Edgar Allan Poe expressed pleasure that he was seeing some essays which he had read before but whose patrimony he had not known; 3 Poe, however, made no mention of where he had seen some of the essays earlier. Not all of the original sources and dates have been identified, but the following have been gleaned from here and there. "Happiness" (I, 2-17) originally bore the title of "Homily" in the National Gazette and Literary Register , March 31, 1829, p. 1, cols. 1-3. A correspondent using the signature of "Eudoxia" asked Walsh to write on the subject. "Female Training" (I, 17-32) was at first an essay in two parts, the last of which appeared as "Didactics" in the National Gazette and Literary Register , April 21, 1829, p. 1, cols. 1-4; and April 24, 1829, p. 1, cols. 2-5. A correspondent who signed herself "Evadne" had requested that Walsh write on the subject. "Wedded Love" (I, 32-46) first appeared as a part of "Female Biography," American Quarterly Review , V (June, 1829), 438-473; also, a part of this essay appeared earlier in "Bishop Heber's India," American Quarterly Review , IV (September, 1828), 115-156. "The Stage" (I, 101-106) was composed mainly from two editorials which appeared originally in the National Gazette and Literary Register , respectively, January 2, 1822, p. 4, cols. 1-2; and January 30, 1822, p. 2, col. 5. The first of these editorials was written as a response to a correspondent, signing himself as "A Parent," who wanted the theatre in Philadelphia abolished because of its immorality; the second was in response to one "Melancthon" (said by the editor to be a "man of taste") who also wanted the theatre abolished. "Lord Byron and Morality" (I, 141-146) was a composite essay made up of editorial strictures written against the poet in the editorial column of the National Gazette and Literary Register , March 2, 1832, p. 1, col. 1. This editorial was only a part of a literary war waged by Walsh for years against the poet and his influence in America. 4 "Revision and Correction" (I, 166-171) was, in a large part, lifted from "American Poetry," American Quarterly Review , VI (September, 1829), 240-262. "General Miscellany" (I, 191-219) was collected from many sources, but two pages, 198-199, came from "Carter's Letters from Europe," American Quarterly Review , II (December, 1827), 539-584. "Sentences" (I, 220-234) is a miscellany of highly sententious sentences and paragraphs obviously drawn from many editorials. One substantial paragraph (p. 228) on the subject of nationalism first appeared in the National Gazette and Literary Register , November 18, 1834, p. 2, col. 4. Walsh penned this editorial in defense of the excellent national character of the North American Review and his own American Quarterly Review , both of which had been impugned as non-American by the editor of the Richmond Compiler . Other aphoristic statements in this essay (p. 234) appeared initially under the title of "Editorial Saws" in the National Gazette and Literary Register , October 31, 1829, p. 1, cols. 1-2; and November 10, 1829, p. 1, col. 2. "Phrenology" (II, 56-65) was a piece of Swiftian satire that was first inserted in the National Gazette and Literary Register on April 13, 1822, p. 1, cols. 1-3. This essay was only one of many of Walsh's editorial jibes at the phrenologists. It was this piece alone that Edgar Allan Poe, who credited phrenology much, found fault with when he reviewed Walsh's work. 5 "Slander" (II, 70-77) was extracted partially from an essay entitled "Didactics" in the National Gazette and Literary Register , May 16, 1835, p. 2, cols. 1-2. "Force of Imagination" (II, 78-85), probably the oldest essay included in Didactics , appeared in two installments in Joseph Dennie's Port Folio , IV (August 25, 1804), 265; and IV (September 1, 1804), 273. "Female Intellect" (II, 128-135) first appeared in "Female Biography," American Quarterly Review , V (June, 1829), 438-473. "William Pinkney" (II, 158-165) was a tribute written upon the death of the diplomat, an old friend of the author. This eulogistic editorial, written as a lapidary sketch, appeared first in the National Gazette and Literary Register , March 16, 1822, p. 1, col. 1. John Neal, an implacable literary enemy of Walsh, saw the editorial and wrote: "I never heard the truth spoken of him [Pinkney] — I never saw the truth written of him. Mr. Walsh — in his modesty had the kindness to manufacture an inscription, under circumstances which the Baltimore bar will not soon forget, — wherein he seems to have exhausted his own dictionary." — John Neal, Randolph : A Novel (n.p., 1823), II, 238. "Collegiate Education" (II, 165-171) was written first as a part of a review of William Wirt's Old Bachelor in "The Old Bachelor," The Analectic Magazine , XII (October, 1818), 265-294. It was "Collegiate Education" which most impressed Edgar Allan Poe when he reviewed Didactics for the Southern Literary Messenger . 6 Poe's excellent impression contrasts to that which William Wirt had when he read Walsh's review back in 1818. Derogating Walsh's abilities as a critic, Wirt wrote to his friend Francis W. Gilmer: "But in truth I really think him deficient in the chief ingredient of a critic, I mean native delicacy of tact which informs a man intuitively &amp; infallibly what is beauty and what is not. . . . He knows, too, the just principles by which criticism should be regulated toward the author: that it is the business of the critic to praise as well as to censure, whenever they are due. He understands, also, the mechanical rules of criticism. But all this cannot supply the native want of sensitive delicacy without which a man can never be a great critic." 7 "Oxford" (II, 171-176) is an epistolary essay which young Walsh wrote as "Letter from England" in the Port Folio , N.S. II (February, 1810), 132-150. "Duelling" (II, 183-189) appeared first as a part of an editorial on the subject of honor in the National Gazette and Literary Register , March 30, 1830, p. 1, cols. 2-3. "Washington Irving" (II, 217-222) was composed mainly from three editorials in the National Gazette and Literary Register , July 17, 1824, p. 3, col. 4; May 24, 1832, p. 2, col. 2; March 31, 1835, p. 2, cols. 1-2. "Dr. Parr and Scholarship" (II, 231-234), a tribute to the great classicist, was originally a part of Walsh's "Memoirs of Dr. Parr," American Quarterly Review V (March, 1829), 233-258. It is quite likely that sources of other essays than these listed will be discovered, but since some of the compositions never got into print, the time and circumstances of their writing will forever remain unknown.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Emerson's Annotations in the British Museum Copy of the DIAL by Burton R. Pollin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The important task of identifying the largely anonymous contributors to the Dial was energetically undertaken by George Willis Cooke, in the late nineteenth century. His preliminary determination of the names was published in 1885, 1 and his final statement was properly included in the second of the two supplementary volumes that accompanied the set of the Dial reprinted by the Rowfant Club in 1901-02. 2 I know of no updating of Cooke's list, nor is there any need for a full one since he accurately says, "In several lists that have been used there is an amount of divergence not very large, and it is much lessened by a careful investigation" (II.193). Cooke had the advantage of being able to check various dubious or "open" items by applying directly to contributors to the Dial or to their heirs during the nineteenth century. The marked copies that he consulted included Thoreau's set; one in the University of Michigan, marked by William Ellery Channing; "lists" in the Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, the Boston Athenaeum, and Harvard University; private sets owned by subscribers or their heirs; and, finally, Emerson's set of the Dial with its detailed identifications (Preface, I.vi-vii). This last is now deposited in the Houghton Library of Harvard and will form one part of my tripartite collation, given below, since it is the most complete of all the lists. 3 George W. Cooke, however, along with other students of Emerson, seemed unaware of a very detailed listing of contributors' names which Emerson himself inserted into a set of the Dial magazine acquired by the British Museum. There is little question about the circumstances under which Emerson filled in the names, usually in the Table of Contents of each volume, but occasionally in the text at the foot of the article or poem. Two manuscript headnotes in faded ink indicate the source of the annotations originally. The Table of Contents of the first volume reads: "When Mr Emerson was in England in 1847-8, He, at my request, wrote the names of the authors against their various contribution to the Dial in the following List of Contents. A. I." On the Contents page of the fourth volume we find, written in the same autograph: "The names of the authors of the various papers were written by Mr Emerson at A Ireland's residence in Manchester in the winter of 1847 A I." Emerson's inscription is further confirmed by a statement in a book by "A. I.," that is, by Alexander Ireland. "An originally subscribed-for copy is in the possession of the writer of this memoir, which is rendered unique and very precious by having the authorship of each article indicated in Emerson's own handwriting." 4 Since Ireland died in 1894 it was unlikely that Cooke had knowledge of the British Museum's acquisition of the set in time for his publication of 1902. Students of Emerson are in no need of the details of Emerson's relations with this newspaper man. Originally from Edinburgh, Ireland had forged a career and name for himself in Manchester, acquired a magnificent library, and published a variety of literary papers. While still in Edinburgh he had been greatly impressed by Emerson's sermon in the Young Street Unitarian Chapel in 1833 and subsequently became, in Rusk's term, the "chief instigator of the lecture tour of 1847-8," after hearing about Emerson's Lyceum success from Margaret Fuller. 5 He saw Emerson again on his visit of 1872. Since he was captivated by the sense of purpose in the magazine and the "eminence" of the contributors — to a much greater extent than the editors, Margaret Fuller and Emerson later 6 — it was natural for him to ask Emerson to seek to recall the contributors to the 1840-44 defunct publication. One wonders why, as a newspaper and literary man, he later failed to publicize his precious list of the writers. It is true that the cognoscenti in or near Concord, with the increasing importance of Transcendentalism in American literary thought, could puzzle out the authorship of some of the articles from the occasional letter or letters designating the names of the contributors, even when the letter was only a formal symbol, like the "Z" for Caroline Sturgis, or the "U" for W. H. Channing (II.45) and the "A" for Margaret Fuller (II.437) who is usually designated as "F." To a Transcendentalist reader "H. D. T." could mean only Thoreau, and "P." Parker, and "C." Cranch, but why should "M. L. O." betoken James Russell Lowell (I.366)? Again, it would be possible for some members of the group to recognize poems printed in the Dial as bearing the earmarks of William Ellery Channing, confirmed by their inclusion in the 1843 and 1847 volumes of his poetry, but Emerson did not expect this degree of awareness in England. Hence, he filled out several entries that were obvious to Americans and several that he left in "letter" form in the Harvard set. In a few instances he identified items in the text rather than in the Table of Contents, as I occasionally indicate in my lists or in the discussion below. My system of recording my collations is based on the following facts. Cooke's list of contributors is given at the end of his second supplementary volume (pp. 196-211), where they may be consulted by any student of Emerson. He did not specify for which items he was specifically using the authority of the Emerson (or Houghton) set, and since that is probably the most complete of all the authoritative lists, I wish to enable the reader to detect any discrepancies or omissions in any of the three, including the British Museum set. When Cooke's fill-in substantially matches both the Houghton copy and the British Museum copy, I omit that title. (I ignore differences in forms, such as the use of a manuscript "Z" by Emerson in the Houghton copy for Caroline Sturgis, called by Cooke "Caroline Tappan.") 7 The significant discrepancies between the British Museum and the Cooke listings are starred for separate discussion below my listing. The individual variations between Emerson's two sets of attributions are also indicated, even though a few merely show fill-ins for the British reader, presumed less familiar with Concord figures. When both of Emerson's lists are blank, that fact is noted to show Cooke's reliance upon other sources entirely, for those items. A blank entry is indicated by a zero (o). The question marks in Cooke's listing are shown as he prints them. The first page only of each article is shown, and all data of publication are omitted save the volume and page number. (Each volume, paged continuously, covers one year — from July through April, in quarters, starting with July, 1840, and ending with April, 1844.) The printed letter, which is occasionally used to designate authorship, is added to each title in a parenthesis.

      <field name="fulltext">Discrepancies and Special Elements Discussed In the first volume, "A Sign from the West" with a printed "C." (usually the symbol of Cranch) is attributed to C. P. Cranch by both Cooke and the Harvard library set, but in the British Museum copy, it is given to J. F. Clarke. This is a review of Andrew Wylie's Sectarianism in Heresy (I.171-172). One cannot be certain, upon examining the contributions of Cranch and Clarke, which one is the more likely author, since both contributed prose and poetry to the Dial , 8 and both were gentlemen of the clergy, interested in reviewing theological works. The prose style appears to me more characteristic of Cranch's writing. 9 Since both "First Crossing the Alleghanies" (I.59) and "Nature and Art" (I.173) are marked with a printed "F. C." one suspects that the "C." for "A Sign from the West" designates Cranch. Because this occurs as the second entry from the top of page iv, Emerson may have been careless in inscribing "C. F. Clarke's" as he did for the first and the fourth lines on the same page. The second discrepancy is the attribution of "The Day Breaks" (I.193) to Ellen Hooper in the Harvard copy and to "C. S." in the British Museum Dial . The "Z." for Caroline Sturgis, at the foot of the page clearly identifies the second of the two poems as Caroline's, while the separate identification cited by Cooke shows the upper poem, "The Wood-Fire," to be Ellen's (II.55). Emerson probably failed to look directly at the page for the printed "Z." when he was filling out his set of the Dial which is now in Harvard; hence he attributed both poems on the page to Ellen Sturgis. Volume Two offers one discrepancy, that for "De Profundis Clamavi," an unattributed sonnet placed directly after the "Sonnet: To Mary on Her Birthday" (II.359) and before "Music: To Martha" (II.360), both marked "B. F. P" in print. These two poems were written by Benjamin Franklin Presbury, then an attractive young man who was to become a lawyer, litterateur, and librarian as well as author of the anti-slavery novel, The Mustee (see Cooke, II.129-132). It is clear that "De Profundis Clamavi" is also his work, although Emerson carelessly inscribed only the "B. F." part of his name directly under his written "B. F. Presbury" for the preceding poem and before that of the "Music" entry (on the top of the next page in the Table of Contents, II.v). The third volume offers four discrepancies. The first — for "Vespers. (Sa.)" (III.76-77) — is the gravest problem, for it duplicates the attribution in the Harvard copy to George W. Curtis, which Cooke flatly declares to be impossible. "The personal letter" from Curtis that Cooke cites needs to be presented in view of another "new" attribution to Curtis made later by Emerson: "When 'The Dial' was published I was a boy, and I knew very little of its management or 'make-up.' I did not write 'Vespers'; and, so far as I remember I wrote only one poem, beginning, 'Death is here and death is there.' I sent it anonymously, and I do not think that the authorship was known to the editors" (II.170). This seems to be almost definitive, especially since the one positively identified poem by Curtis, "A song of Death" (IV.87), is different in style from both "Vespers" and the "Lines" (IV.265) ascribed by Emerson. The printed "Sa." for the author, at first, might be taken for Jonathan Ashley Saxton, the lawyer and radical reformer (see Cooke, II.113-116) and author of "Prophecy" in the Dial (II.83-121). A comparison of the style of that long prose piece and that of "Vespers" fails to support this assumption. This remains one of the unresolved blanks in all the lists. We have here virtually disposed also of Emerson's inserted "Geo. Curtis" for the "Lines" (X.) on III.265 as an error, by virtue of style and Curtis's letter, as well. Cooke's ascription to "Ellen Cooper (?)" seems likely, but unfortunately the Harvard Dial fails to clear up the matter. In this same volume are two items attributed differently by both the Harvard Dial and by Cooke. In the text Emerson writes "C. S." or "Caroline Sturgis." About the second, i.e., the four lines at the foot of the page, "I asked the angels to come to me" (III.85), there is little doubt that the attribution is correct; it was omitted in the Harvard copy probably because it does not appear as an entry in the Table of Contents, and, being only a quatrain, was overlooked in the text itself. Cooke cautiously leaves it blank. The earlier instance is "To Shakespeare" (III.81), which was ascribed to William Ellery Channing in the Harvard Dial , that was very reasonably followed by Cooke. The lapsus memoriae of Emerson in ascribing it to "C. S." is, perhaps, a slight token of the importance that this, the younger of the two cultivated and brilliant Sturgis sisters, had assumed for Emerson — "the American Bettine," in Higginson's phrase (Cooke, II.60). There is increasing evidence of the emotional and creative tie that linked Emerson and Caroline. 10 There is only one more item worthy of slight comment in the third volume, Emerson's reprint, in the Dial (III.529-531), of a passage on friendship from Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose (Fragment B, lines 5201-5284). No attempt is made to cast the passage into modern English; it is obviously filler, coming as it does just before the final section, "Record of the Months," but filler which nevertheless bears traces of Emerson's taste in reading and in topics. Cooke prints it as Emerson's (his choice presumably) with a question mark, while it is unmarked in the Harvard and British Museum copies, probably assumed to be the editor's selection. Volume four offers a similar type of problem, scarcely of great importance; the extracts now, from the Persian Desatir or Regulations , part of the Dial's "Ethnical Scriptures" in the issue of July, 1843 (IV.59-62), are attributed by Cooke to Emerson, with a question mark, although Cooke attributes the beginning of the series of excerpts to Thoreau (III.493-494) and also two later sets to Thoreau (IV.205-210 and IV.402-404). The last of the series (IV.529-536) is ascribed to Emerson with no dubiety. Since neither of the two sets is marked with the compiler's name, Cooke must have relied upon other evidence, internal or external. A slight discrepancy in the poem, "Lines" (IV.306), by Caroline Tappan, is resolved in favor of Cooke's choice, by contrast with the Harvard copy's ascription to her sister, Ellen S. Hooper — no serious matter. The British Museum copy confirms Cooke's questioning ascription of the delightful six-line "The Three Dimensions" (IV.226) unequivocally to Emerson, as it does for Emerson's essay, "The Comic" (IV.247-256). Similarly, the British Museum copy confirms the ascription to Channing of "Autumn," "Autumn Woods," and "The Death of Shelley" (IV.186-187, 350, and 471) and to Samuel G. Ward of "The Twin Loves" (IV.455-457). Likewise, it supports Charles Lane's very obvious authorship of "Millennial Church" (4.537-40), which corresponds to his previous articles on the Shaker community, while it totally discountenances Emerson's strange item in quotation marks, "W B G?" in the Harvard copy. One last item which does not appear in the list of attributions requires passing mention and seems peculiarly appropriate in content for my final note on the annotations in the British Museum copy. In the January, 1842 issue of the Dial is a quatrain embedded in the last page of Emerson's "The Senses and the Soul" (II.374-379): Why should we suffer ourselves to be cheated by sounding names and fair shows? The titles, the property, the notoriety, the brief consequence of our fellows are only the decoration of the sacrifice, and add to the melancholy of the observer. "The earth goes on the earth glittering with gold, The earth goes to the earth sooner than it should, The earth builds on the earth castles and towers, The earth says to the earth, all this is ours." Perhaps a token of Emerson's 1833 visit to Edinburgh, when first he met Alexander Ireland, is his marginal annotation for the verses: "Old Tombstone / Melrose Abbey."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"Bartleby the Scrivener" and Melville's Contemporary Reputation by George Monteiro</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the publication of Moby-Dick and Pierre in the early 1850's, it became clear that Melville's popularity was in sharp decline. That decline was accelerated rather than checked by the appearance of The Confidence-Man in 1857. By 1863, then, when it was noted that Melville had published nothing for several years, the conclusion seemed inevitable: Melville has "forgotten the ambition of authorship." This was not quite true. But in the course of this piece the author made passing reference to Melville's "remarkable sketch of a wall street scrivener." 1 When "Bartleby" first appeared in Putnam's Monthly Magazine (November and December, 1853), it had attracted attention, but not much. When Melville included the story, three years later, in The Piazza Tales , however, it turned out to be the collection's most highly regarded piece (judging from reviews), outdistancing all other selections, including "Benito Cereno." 2 But this incidental remark in 1863, seven years after book publication, was the very last public mention of "Bartleby," it has been assumed, until the revival of interest in Melville's work in the 1920's. It is surprising, then, to run across a reference to "Bartleby" dated 1880, nearly a quarter of a century after The Piazza Tales and a full forty years before the Melville revival. It is even more surprising to discover such a reference in the pages of the Atlantic Monthly , a journal which down through the years was more hostile than sympathetic to Melville's work. 3 In the Atlantic's June 1880 issue was published the anonymous piece, "One Reward of Literary Labor": There is a reward of literary labor which seems to me so great that I must mention it. Let me give an illustration: A boy was at work in a lumber mill in the backwoods. Two other boys were his comrades. At night it was their amusement, in the shanty where they had their rations, to read the magazines. "A Moosehead Journal," "Have we a Bourbon among us?" and "Bartleby the Scrivener" were just out then. These and other articles were read with that interest, curiosity, and wonder which they are calculated to inspire in youthful minds. The men who could write such articles were regarded with a degree of respect which belongs properly to beings who are above our common humanity. The inspiration of these readings and the influence of the articles were felt by others who borrowed the magazines. The history of the various writers and their peculiarities were inquired into by the boys. It came to be the prevailing ambition to excel in literature. 4 In its first year of publication Putnam's Monthly presented all three pieces that, individually and in combination, fired the literary ambition of boys laboring in a backwoods lumber mill. Further identifications are pertinent. "Have we a Bourbon among us?" is an essay by the Reverend John H. Hanson, now cleanly forgotten. "A Moosehead Journal," an account of a pre-Thoreauvian journey into the wilderness of northern New England, may evoke response as the spirited product of James Russell Lowell, a founder of the Atlantic Monthly and that journal's first editor. Of the author of "One Reward of Literary Labor," however, we know nothing. His name remains a secret. Given the ironic fact that "Bartleby," sometimes read as a parable of the writer's fate in a hostile society, 5 should actually buoy the spirits and foster the ambition of a would-be author, it is intriguing to believe that that specific piece of information would prove significant.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dating Whitman's Early Notebooks by Floyd Stovall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Harned Collection of Whitman materials in the Library of Congress there are six manuscript notebooks that contain early drafts of some verses published in the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass or notes in prose preliminary to the writing of verse. These notebooks are listed in the 1855 catalog of the Whitman collections in the Library as items 80, 83, 84, 85, 86, and 87. Emory Holloway examined these, among other manuscripts, soon after they were given to the Library by Thomas B. Harned, one of Whitman's literary executors, and published portions of the notebooks, including items 80, 85, 86, and 87, but selected nothing from 83 and 84. 1 Later Clifton J. Furness published several disconnected excerpts from item 84, but as they were taken out of context they provide no clear impression of the notebook. 2 More recently Edward F. Grier has published a detailed analysis of the contents of Notebook 80. 3 I first examined these notebooks in the summer of 1934 and had microfilm copies made of five of them along with some later manuscripts. I still have the two spools containing microfilms of Notebooks 80, 84, and 86, and a later book (No. 91, about 1860-61). The spool containing two other early notebooks which I cannot now identify was lost in one of my major moves, probably when I moved from Texas to North Carolina in 1949. Microfilm readers were unavailable to me in 1934 and for several years afterward, and in the meantime I had become engaged in studies not involving the notebooks. Only recently have I been able to give close attention to them. 4 In a footnote to his text of Notebook No. 80, Holloway calls it "the earliest Whitman notebook extant." He notes that it contains the date 1847 and three of Whitman's addresses: 71 Prince Street, Brooklyn, 30 Fulton Street (the office of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , which Whitman edited from March 1846 to January, 1848), and 106 Myrtle Avenue. The Whitmans built the house on Prince Street and moved into it in the spring of 1847, and they moved from that place to their new home on Myrtle Avenue in the spring of 1849. On this evidence chiefly he concludes that the entries in the notebook were made during the years 1847-49. 5 He says the first two addresses have been cancelled, but he fails to note that the significant part of the third address — "106 Myrtle" — is also cancelled. If, as I believe, Whitman meant to cancel this address it would seem, by the reasoning used by Holloway, that he must have been still using the notebook when he left Myrtle Avenue in September, 1852. Grier did notice this cancellation and came to the conclusion that certain entries in the book were made as late as 1852. He mentions Esther Shephard's opinion that the book dates from 1854, but he gives little weight to her evidence. 6 But Grier accepts Holloway's opinion that parts of the book were written as early as 1847. Until recently I was inclined to agree, but after closer study of the microfilms I have changed my mind. Notebook No. 80, as stated on a sheet which is the first pictured in my microfilm, was bound in green board with a brown leather backstrip. Holloway does not mention the binding, but he contributes one interesting detail. The notebook, he said, "locks with a pencil thrust through three improvised leather loops." Whether the pencil was in it when he saw the book he does not say; if it was there when I saw it, I do not remember it. The pencil, if it was there, would have been removed before the microfilm was made. As the microfilm does reveal, these loops were fastened, presumably pasted, to the outside and inside edges of the covers, the middle one to the front cover and the upper and lower ones to the back. Thus, a pencil thrust through these three loops parallel to the backstrip would keep the book closed. The addresses mentioned above are written on the inside cover, or end paper; this is followed by a fly-leaf on the recto of which is written "Joseph Pemberton maker Liverpool" and below that "No. 41, 303" and some words I can't make out. Below a line drawn across the page are the words "Quartier au Sable" and "No. 51, 575." All of this, so far as I can tell, has nothing to do with the main contents of the book. The verso is blank. This fly-leaf is unruled on both sides. At the end of the book there is an end paper like the one at the front but no fly-leaf. All other pages in the book have vertical lines as in an account book, a single line about half an inch from the left edge, a single line about half an inch from the right edge, and a double line about an inch from the right edge. Holloway's footnote says, "Seven pages, apparently containing accounts, have been cut from the front of the book." I suppose he means seven leaves. The stubs show on the microfilm that the pages were ruled vertically. Other pages in the interior of the book, not noted by Holloway but mentioned by Grier, may have been cut out leaving what on the microfilm look like stubs. On one of these stubs is a double row of zeros, further suggesting that the book had been used for accounts. When the microfilm was made the hinges were so loose that the edges of pages underneath the one microfilmed show and parts of some words can be distinguished. At the top of page 17 (I follow Grier's numbering) is written in pencil the following: "1847 / April 19th mason commenc'd work on the basement rooms / mason paid in full." The date is in the upper left hand corner of the page and the other two lines are under that. Below the last words a pencil line, very pale, has been drawn horizontally, and another line, less pale, is drawn diagonally from the number down across the entire entry as if to cancel it. On page 63 appears the following entry near the top: "Amount rec'd from Mr. V. A. 1847." The reference is doubtless to Van Anden, owner of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle . Some pencil lines below these have been erased so well that I cannot make out the words, but I assume they related to the Van Anden entry. It seems probable that this notebook was in Whitman's possession in 1847 and that the entries under that date were made at the time. Below the entry last mentioned, some tentative lines of verse continued from another page are much brighter and must, I believe, be of a later date. Of later date also are two names and addresses not mentioned by either Holloway or Grier on the inside of the front cover. At the top, above the name "Walt Whitman" and the address "71 Prince st.," is the following: "Talbot, Wilson st. go to corner Division av. &amp; 7th st." Beneath Whitman's last address, "106 Myrtle avenue Brooklyn," is the following: "Mr. Stebbins, 110 Broadway Room 8 over the Metropolitan Bank." I do not know the significance of Stebbins, but the name of Talbot is repeated on the inside of the back cover and is noticed by Grier. Written lengthwise from bottom to top of the page, apparently in ink, is the following: "Talbot Wilson st. between Lee &amp; Division av. two squares east of Bedford av." Grier identifies him as Jesse Talbot, listed in the Brooklyn directory as living at that address. I am sure he is the same Talbot whose name and address were written on the inside of the front cover. Both entries, presumably, were made near the same time, most likely 1854. This is undoubtedly the Jesse Talbot whose oil painting of a scene from Pilgrim's Progress Whitman owned in 1857 when, on June 17, he included it with other merchandise as part payment of a debt he owed James Parton. 7 Also on the inside of the back cover, written in pencil across the top of the page, is this entry: "Chapman 147 Atlantic st. bet Henry &amp; Clinton." Grier identifies him as Frederic A. Chapman, an artist, who in 1854-55 is listed in the Brooklyn directory as living at that address. I suspect that Whitman went to that address to see Chapman's paintings. 8 Not mentioned by Grier are these addresses on the verso of the last leaf (ruled) before the back cover, written in pencil lengthwise on the page from bottom to top: "or 13 or 25) No. 11 Massachusetts Corporation Jane &amp; Rebecca Horton," and below that: "John I Storms, Big Creek P. O., Shelby County, Tenn." I have found nothing about Jane and Rebecca Horton, but I suspect that John I. Storms was related to George Storms, mentioned in Specimen Days , along with Broadway Jack and a few others, as one of the omnibus drivers Whitman knew. 9 During the 1860's he had some correspondence with George I. Storms, probably the same person, and in the 1870's he exchanged letters with Walt Whitman Storms, although Whitman's letters may not be now extant. 10 Holloway prints portions of Notebook No. 85. With all the notebooks available for close examination, he expressed the opinion that "the probable date of this book is not far from that of Manuscript Notebook No. 1." His No. 1 is L. C. No. 80, just discussed. Internal evidence in Notebook 85 proves that some of it, and I suspect all of it, was written in 1854. Holloway calls this notebook No. 2. Since it was not among the missing and still is in the Library of Congress I have recently secured a microfilm of it. It contains a good deal of experimental verse, and one portion of this is a brief account of the wreck of the ship San Francisco , and how the captain of a rescue ship "chalked on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you , and held it up and did it." These very words, or most of them, are used in an account of the episode in "Song of Myself," lines 824-28. The wreck occurred in early January, 1854, and the accounts of it that Whitman used were published in the New York Tribune for January 19 and 21. Whitman clipped these stories and bracketed the passage paraphrased in the notebook and in the poem. 11 This does not prove that all parts of the notebook were written after January 21, 1854, but since the quotation occurs early in the verse portion of the notebook, there seems a strong probability that all, or most, of it was. The first entry in this notebook, in prose, mentions a plan to write a poem "incarnating the mind of an old man" on the theme of "Joy Joy Joy," which may possibly be the germ of the 1860 poem "Poem of Joys," later called "A Song of Joys." The fourth paragraph, beginning "Amelioration is the blood that runs through the body of the universe," is pretty certainly an early conception of the 1856 "Poem of the Sayers of the Words of the Earth," later "A Song of the Rolling Earth." Very likely these notes were made like most of the others in 1854 although the poems they are associated with were not written until later, in any case not published in 1855. Notebook No. 86 in the Library catalog is all prose and seems to me to be of about the same date as those discussed above, possibly a little earlier. It contains a few ideas used in "Song of Myself," but the only passage that is verbally repeated is the the passage beginning, "I want that tenor, large and fresh as the creation," etc., a prose version of lines 594-610 of "Song of Myself." The reference is unquestionably to Alessandro Bettini, whom Whitman had heard a number of times between June, 1851, and February, 1852, when Bettini left New York never to return. 12 In the third of a series of "Letters from Paumanok," dated August 11, 1851, Whitman pays high tribute to the singing of Bettini, using the phrase "the vast, pure Tenor, — identity of the Creative Power itself." 13 Since the passage in the notebook is much fuller, and closer to the language of the poem, I should judge it to have been written much later than the newspaper passage, if not in 1854 then surely no earlier than 1853. Notebook No. 83, from which Holloway printed nothing, has no significance for my present subject except that at one place, while discussing how people suffering disaster forget about their valuable possessions, such as money, diamonds, etc., Whitman illustrates his point by reference to actions of passengers on the San Francisco after it was wrecked. Obviously the detail was picked up from newspaper accounts. Notebook 87 is only partially preserved in selections printed by Holloway and in incomplete records in the Library. I do not believe, however, it contained much that would be helpful in establishing the date of composition of verse in other notebooks. It contains no verse. Notebook No. 84 is such an interesting one that I am surprised that Holloway printed nothing from it. There is not space in this brief article to discuss it in detail, but in appearance it is much like the others. The first four pages and the last page of the book contain notes about Egypt, reflecting Whitman's interest of 1854 and after. 14 On page 4 I find the following note, which is useful in establishing the date of the book as well as evidence of Whitman's interest in Egypt: "Dr. Abbott tells me that Lepsius told him of finding monuments in Ethiopia with inscriptions and astronomical signs upon them." Whitman made frequent visits to the Egyptian Museum, which was established by Dr. Henry Abbott in New York, probably in 1853, for the first catalog of the collection issued in this country was published that year. A second and larger catalogue was published in 1854. Dr. Bucke says that Whitman visited this Museum "for over two years off and on." 15 I cannot say for certain, but I suspect that these two years included most of the period of Dr. Abbott's residence in New York. Holloway said he left for Cairo, not to return, in 1855. 16 Two passages in the notebook were incorporated in "Song of the Rolling Earth" published in 1856. On page 16 appears the following passage: "The mirror that Nature holds and hides behind is deep and floating and ethereal and faithful. A man always sends and sees himself in it. . . . bright from it he reflects the fashion of his gods and all his religions and politics and books and public institutions — ignorance or knowledge — kindness or cruelty — grossness or refinement — definitions or chaos — each is unerringly sent back to him or her who casually gazes." The manuscript has many revisions and is evidently not a final draft. A slightly different and perhaps final version in another notebook in the Library of Congress has been printed. 17 On page 17 appears the following note, which is without revision and evidently copied from an earlier draft: "There is a full sized woman of calm and voluptuous beauty . . . . The unspeakable charm of the face of the mother of many children is the charm of her face . . . she is clean and sweet and simple with immortal health . . . . she holds always before her what has the quality of a mirror, and dwells serenely behind it." 18 Another passage, page 44, is related to "A Song of the Rolling Earth": "The architect that comes among the stonecutters and heaps of cut stone poem describes how the workmen, possessed with an indescribable faith go on age after age in their work — and at last came architects and used each in its place the stones they had cut." Apparently Whitman planned an entire poem on this theme, but it came out as only three lines (123-25) in the poem mentioned: Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost, It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come to use, When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear. A number of lines, which I need not quote, on page 30 of this notebook were first printed in the poem "Debris," in the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass . The poem was not thereafter reprinted as a whole. A few other lines meant for this poem occur later in the notebook. Only one or two passages in this notebook relate at all to "Song of Myself," one to "There was a Child Went Forth," and one to "A Song for Occupations." Three at least relate to "I Sing the Body Electric." One of these contains a passage that helps to date the notebook. On page 28, near the top, appears this entry: "Poem 'The Bridegroom' / ? for recitation / (tremulous with joy Mario's voice quivering) (bring in a Death ". The reference to Mario's voice proves that this entry was set down after September 4, 1854, for it was on that night that Giuseppi Mario first sang in New York, together with his more famous wife, Giulia Grisi. 19 There is no more of the poem on the bridegroom until pages 43-44, where there are five or six lines under the title "Bridalnight;" the lines were used in "I Sing the Body Electric" (57-63). Another reference in Notebook 84, page 54, is equally definite as to its date. The last principal entry on that page is as follows: "poem picture of war (the hospital at Sebastopol) then the opposite — the inferences and results — what war does to develope and strengthen and make more energetic and agile humanity and what it contributes to poetry, oratory, etc." This entry could not have been made before October 25, 1854, the date of the first attack on Sebastopol and the famous charge of the Light Brigade, on that date; perhaps weeks later. The Encylopaedia Britannica records that by the end of November the British army hospitals had eight thousand sick and wounded soldiers. 20 The reference to war's contribution to poetry suggests the possibility that Whitman wrote after he had read Tennyson's poem, "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which was first published in the London Examiner on December 9, 1854. The date 1847 in Notebook No. 80, in my opinion, has nothing to do with the date of the composition of the verse and verse-related prose in that notebook. I assume that Whitman found an old notebook, used probably while he was editor of the Eagle , cut out the leaves that had been used, except one, and utilized the remaining leaves for verse and prose notes related to projected poems. In fact I am not at all sure that Holloway was right in calling this Whitman's earliest notebook. Notebook No. 86, Holloway's No. 3, which is all prose, strikes me as being earlier. Moreover, the verse in Notebook 80 seems to be no less finished and mature than that in Notebooks 84 and 85, which are almost certainly the work of 1854. The idea that Whitman could have written in 1847 verse like that in Notebook 80 and waited eight years to publish it is surely incredible. Every evidence in these compositions, the factual references, the style, and the handwriting, contributes to my belief that no significant part of any of these notebooks was written before 1853, and most of the entries in verse date from 1854 and possibly the early part of 1855. If I am correct, many scholars, including myself, have been wrong in accepting Holloway's conjecture that Whitman began to write Leaves of Grass in 1847-49, and Whitman was right in telling Trowbridge and Dr. Bucke that he began in 1854, or not much earlier.</field>

See also Gay W. Allen, The Solitary Singer , Appendix B, p. 599. 6 Mrs. Shephard's evidence was Whitman's telling J. T. Trowbridge in 1860 that he began "definitely writing out" the poems in 1854. She supposes this notebook to be part of such writing. Grier thinks the verse in the notebook is too imperfect to have been written as late as 1854. 7 See With Walt Whitman in Camden , III, 236-39 for an account of this matter. Whitman wrote O'Connor in 1869 that the painting was worth four or five hundred dollars but that he thought he put it in for one hundred. Talbot was an associate member of the National Academy of Design, elected in 1842. (See the New York Historical Society's Dictionary of Artists in America 1564-1860 [1957], p. 618.) It is possible, of course, that Whitman wrote Talbot's name in the book in 1847 if he lived then at the same address. 8 Frederic A. Chapman was the first president of the Brooklyn Art Association.

I did not at the time of transcribing this note identity the notebook and neither does Furness. I think it possible that it was not in a notebook but in a separate manuscript sheet. There were many such in the Library in 1934, several of them sometimes stuck together with pins. 18 This is not included in Walt Whitman's Workshop , but it is in my notes to "Song of the Rolling Earth" exactly as quoted above except that "full sized" is written as one word, not two. The poem was first published in 1856. The peculiar use of a string of periods instead of punction suggests the style of the Preface to the 1855 edition. 19 Odell, Annals of the New York Stage , VI, 390.

      <field name="heading_text">Mechanized Textual Collation and Recent Designs by Gordon Lindstrand</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since Charlton Hinman's perfection of the first mechanical-optical instrument for comparing texts within a single edition-typesetting, the approving response of analytical bibliographers and textual editors has led to two recent developments: the invention of collators with far fewer pretentions than the Hinman machine, thus creating a virtual textual center in the bibliographer's bedroom; and, second, the recognition in the area of textual studies of the need for even more ambitious mechanical, optical, and electronic instruments to assist with the labor of establishing a text. The operation of the Hinman Collator is probably sufficiently well known to exempt it from description here. Its purpose is simply to compare any two copies, presumed to be identical, of a printed, written, or drawn document. For the textual bibliographer the primary use of the machine is for comparison of two copies of a text printed from the same type arrangement — whether by the impressing of standing type, by plate duplication of type, or by planographically produced type configuration. The Hinman uses the original text, and thereby possesses a distinctly important advantage over more recently developed collators that must employ either microfilm or photocopy-facsimile. This advantage of the Hinman is, significantly, the opportunity to scrutinize the condition of the original document, to determine the actual deterioration of printed symbols, not just the photocopy-facsimile which, however well produced, often gratuitously provides distortions of the type images as well as particles of matter not on the original. Moreover, I believe that many users of collation devices are not sufficiently mindful of the telescopic zoom-in capacity of the Hinman and, as well, the fact that there is little point in zooming in, for example, for an examination of broken type showing up on a photocopy. Two of the recent additions to the growing list of collators have been devices that compare text prepared on microfilm or by photocopy-facsimile; a third apparatus makes use only of photocopy-facsimile, not film images. 1 In spite of the obvious drawbacks of copy by film and by photocopy-facsimile, these three new collators are valuable scholarly aids for the reason that availability of the many texts often required either for a study of textual corruption or for a critical edition depends in so many cases entirely on reprographical processes. 2 Since my purpose here is to describe still more collating instruments I will assume general knowledge of how the devices already mentioned operate and bring attention only to those features that relate importantly to the objectives of comparing texts. The disadvantages reported by the developers and users of existing collating machines seem universal to the process. The alignment of the two texts is always difficult, and this problem is certainly aggravated, if not actually created by, the lack of uniformity inherent in the microfilm process — often the source of photocopy-facsimile. It is not surprising that alignment, of actual texts or their photocopies, on the Hinman Collator is both crucial and difficult to achieve. Indeed, because the Hinman machine is a professionally engineered and constructed instrument that must do its job with polished thoroughness and fair reliability, it is necessary to accomplish all adjustments for alignment, focus and for subsequent operation via the potential of the mechanics of the instrument, thus involving movement vertically and laterally of texts that have been "strapped in" for the journey. An advantage of latecomer rivals to the Hinman is that the copies fed to the device and the parts of the device are always quickly accessible to the operator for easily-made adjustments that are so necessary for constant alignment. But however encouraging the prospects seem for these collators that have recently been brought to our attention, the perspective and suggestion offered at the conclusion of one scholar's description of his machine should be kept in mind (although I must disagree with his statement that individual sight collation is the most accurate method for comparing texts): when using a substitute for the Hinman, and even perhaps when using the Hinman itself, one ought to accept the results with some hesitation and be ready to emend the data with those got from other methods of collation. Further, since each textual chore has its distinct challenges, an exchange of problems and solutions would profit the many researchers now so occupied. 3 The ultimate development in collators will undoubtedly be electronic and will presumably permit for the first time rapid and accurate cross-edition or multiple-edition (my terms for collations involving comparison of texts not printed from the same type or type-facsimile reproduction source) collation of texts. There now exist prototypes of electronic instruments that scan texts, "recognize" the symbols examined, and compare them if required with other symbols previously stored in a computer memory. 4 But the optical scanner-computer does not yet possess the versatility necessary to accommodate the many type faces and sizes likely to be encountered in books, nor is its cost low enough to make it accessible to the university textual center. This electronic miracle can also compare texts within the transmission of a single edition-typesetting, but the optical scanner will then of course be keyed to a single type fount and the computer memory bank will contain only symbols of that particular type face and size. There are projects underway now in the application of the computer alone to cross-edition collation, but published results so far do not prove this method, even when available, a satisfactory substitute for visual collation by a team of trained readers. The computer is first supplied — by convenient units of information, such as a line length of verse — with the anchor text (the copy-text, when known at this stage) or text against which all others are to be compared. Each successive text is prepared in a manner after the original on cards (or, conceivably, tape) before being fed into the computer for comparison. For either purpose, the collation across editions or within editions, the tedious and expensive preparation of computer "messages" (units of text) and the number of stages at which accidental alteration of the text could occur (each stage requiring a proofreading check) make the computer sans optical scanner at the present time a questionable tool for textual editing, except for the very largest and best financed editorial projects. While the computer comparison itself is lightning fast, all is still dependent on the speed and fallibility of the keyboard console operators. 5 Not only have we lacked an effective and generally available mechanical or electronic aid for cross-edition collation, the cost and accessibility of a thoroughly reliable collating machine, such as the Hinman Collator, for texts from the same parent edition-typesetting have placed this mechanical aid out of reach for the already large population of scholars working on textual projects. A recently published figure indicates that there are only twenty-eight Hinman machines in existence. 6 But there are alternative solutions, as the recent "poor man's" collators demonstrate. When one is faced with individual sight collation the urgency of finding ways of both cutting the labor and increasing the reliability of the collating grows in proportion to the frustrations endured. In desperate need of some form of assistance for the collation of a large number of texts of novels by Joseph Conrad, I developed in 1960 two mechanical-optical instruments for the performance of the two different kinds of collating chores, the reprint comparisons and the cross-edition collation, which I describe below, respectively, as the Mark I and the Mark II Comparators. My early and elementary experiments with an optical collating apparatus for comparing texts from a single parent edition-typesetting revealed that if each eye viewed one and only one of a pair of texts, presumed to be nearly identical, any differences would be apprehended as the visual sensory apparatus received and mentally compared the two images. The superimposition of images is effected by mental process, and not by the apparatus prior to visual inspection of the texts by an observer. It then remained only to devise a framework and appropriate optical system by which to present the images of the text to an observer. The arrangement of the mechanical and optical components of the instrument is not itself a very delicate process (except to insure correspondence between the two planes of the matter viewed and the viewing optical assembly), and it should be noted that the principle does not require so elaborate and rigid an optical system as to prohibit quick and easy adjustment for alignment and focus of the texts and their images. Figure 1 shows the front and end views of one model of the Mark I Comparator. The supporting framework for the optics and the texts is a completely open cabinet to provide access, from both front and rear, for the rapid alignment of texts. The end view shows how the instrument when in use is tilted toward the seated operator to permit comfortable viewing without the introduction of a very elaborate and costly optical system that would "bend" the images of the texts toward the observer. As a consequence of the tilt, it is necessary to introduce movable book mounting platforms that hold the texts or copies of texts being compared. One proceeds through the text first on one side of the leaf and then, after turning the book mount around, on the other; special attachments, illustrated in Figure 1, keep the stock of leaves collated held away from the opened book. The addition of two high intensity lamps for adequate illumination for the texts completes the basic design. While the eyepiece prisms are adjustable only for the short distance of the range of interpupillary separation, the large 45° angle mirrors must be adjustable laterally in order to accommodate variations in the focal lengths of the two texts. In other words, if one text when placed on its supporting platform is closer to the eye than the other text, as occurring most frequently when one text is book copy and the other photocopy-facsimile, the instrument must have the capacity to adjust precisely for the differing distances of the two lines of sight. (The eyes, of course, cannot focus together on objects that are not the same distance — focal length — from the observer.) The instrument should possess a fine adjustment of this kind for the reason that the crude alternative is to move the text having the longer focal length, by piling up supports underneath it, closer to the eye. Finally, the size of the texts to be collated determines the size of the instrument one will need. For the collation of most modern, machine-printed books, an instrument measuring approximately three feet long and no more than fifteen inches for each of the other two dimensions should be sufficient. The optical principle by which variants are detected through the Mark I Comparator is crucial in more than one sense. First, the principle must be understood completely in order to appreciate its potential; second, the principle requires, as with most optical instruments, precise positioning of the eyepiece prisms; third, exact correspondence is necessary in the alignment of all reflecting surfaces. The "mechanism" that detects variance between the two images viewed is not the blinking lights system used in the Hinman, but the capacity of the human nervous system to distinguish the characteristics of the separate input of the visual nerves and so determine (1) if the objects in the field are identical, and (2) the amount of physical separation of the objects in the field, thereby giving us our dimensional apprehension or depth perception. Thus, the design, operation, and theory of this instrument differ entirely from their counterparts in the Hinman or any other existing apparatus. The fact that the eyes are receiving different sources of stimuli means automatically that the eyes are not converging. One is actually, by the muscular action of the eyes, looking into infinity instead of converging for focus as one is doing for almost every other visual stimulus-response event. 7 In the actual operation, then, the process amounts to this: if a discrepancy exists between the two texts, however slight the difference, the observer receives the two images and "mentally" perceives that there is a difference. In the case of a textual variant that is of sufficient size to have necessitated a change in the location in one text of several lines of material, until one text had been "evened up" with the other, the effect is one of total confusion for the area on the page following the beginning of the variant: in short, the effect and the variant are inescapable. When the variant is slight or if so much as a very small portion of a single type symbol is missing in one text, the mode of detection is three-dimensional perception. That is, whatever material that is in one text but not in the other is seen as distinctly raised off the surface of the page. Since experimental depth perception is not a familiar phenomenon, the effects described here are difficult to appreciate unless one has experienced them. If, however, one has ever used a stereopticon or stereoscopic viewer or seen the short-lived "3-D" motion picture innovation, then the effect can at once be understood. The Mark I Comparator is particularly useful for locating reset lines in a text, thanks to the depth perception our visual sensory apparatus possesses. Whenever a line or part of a line has been reset, whether to accommodate a new textual version or from whatever cause that could lead to an alteration in standing type or plates, the observer witnesses a "hill-valley" effect; that is, the reset material seems to stand out in full three-dimensional effect on a surface containing otherwise flat detail. It is apparent that for the hand-printed book the detection of a reprint, set word for word from an earlier edition, is a relatively easy matter. I am of the opinion that the Mark I Comparator may also have the capacity of distinguishing between two texts identical in their symbols but printed in one case from plates or standing type — that is, by the letterpress process — and in the other from a planographic process. The distinction between the two, and the basis for their differentiation by the instrument, is in the degree to which the printed page has been impressed or "embossed": in the planographic process the inked symbols are merely rolled onto the paper, while in letter-press they are impressed on by actual characters mounted on the printing press bed or cylinder. A fourth general capacity of the Comparator permits discerning between a text printed from standing type and one printed from plates. There are additional features and characteristics, chiefly advantages, of the Mark I Comparator and its operation. Since the detection of textual variance is dependent upon mental perception, it is obviously necessary that the two sensory stimuli, fed independently to the brain through each eye, be transmitted in equal strength. In other words, one needs nearly perfect, whether natural or corrected, vision or one must install a simple lens system to correct, for example, for one weak eye. The entire instrument while capable of accommodating through quick adjustment texts in a wide range of page sizes is at the same time portable. I took an early model, for instance, to do collating at a distant special collection, a model that more resembled an egg crate than a respectable institutional apparatus. The Mark I Comparator is, for the reasons given above, easier to use and the operation considerably faster than the Hinman machine because it is an easy matter to align pages and to change leaves. The speed and simplicity achieved depend on the ingenuity in the design of the book mounts or cradles. As to the instrument's additional potential, if it becomes necessary to compare microfilm copy an adaptor can be devised that will permit one eye to view a positive microfilm image. The special requirements for this particular operation are a lens system (for the microfilm image only) plus care and uniformity in the microfilming. A shutter arrangement can also be fitted to the instrument should it ever be found advantageous to replace the original mode of variant detection with the shutter or alternating image principle. Finally, with the reflecting surfaces mounted at appropriate angles, one can arrange the apparatus so as to view the images from directly overhead, or at any angle desired. Given the correct arrangement of the components I have identified, and the optimum in environmental conditions, a practiced operator can collate printed matter of any historical period (during tests the earliest text used was photocopied pages from the works of Sir Thomas Elyot) more rapidly than is ordinarily possible on the Hinman and, as tests have confirmed, with as high a degree of accuracy as is now possible by any collation method. The Mark I Comparator has been subjected to ambitious testing, including speed-accuracy competition with the Hinman. 8 One of the subjects tested happened to have been at work on the texts of Sir Thomas Elyot for about a year on the Hinman Collator, and reported that the Mark I Comparator was easier to operate, speedier in collation, and less tiring on the eyes. I had always assumed that persons with less than perfect vision and who needed to wear corrective lenses could not discern the effects that inform an observer of the presence of either a variant or a reset line. But the tests of four subjects who wore glasses or contact lenses were especially encouraging. A subject who normally wore glasses for correction of a weakness in one eye did not use his glasses for the test, performed beyond expectations, amused himself picking out flyspecks existing only on one text, and finally volunteered the guess that having one weaker eye may actually have aided in perceiving a textual variant. Other subjects who wore their glasses while being tested reported that the prisms of the eyepiece component had sufficient "eye relief" (distance from lens to eye) to permit an observer to wear glasses in comfort. I save for the last the knowledge that for a particular model of the Mark I Comparator I have used extensively the expense did not exceed one hundred dollars for the optics and the professionally formed aluminum parts. For a professionally designed and manufactured model, one may expect to add from two to three hundred dollars for the labor and additional refinements. I believe that "comparison shopping" among comparable instruments will reveal this sum a surprisingly modest investment for a reliable mechanical collating device. The second "comparator" I wish to describe is to be used in a cross or multiple-edition collation — that is, when collating texts that are not from the same edition-typesetting. While it is true that only with the perfection of an electronic computer-scanner device will multiple-edition collation emerge from the limbo of tedium and error of sight collation, in the meantime there are certain conveniences that can assist in this most formidable chore of textual studies. I am convinced through experience that the head-wagging, finger-pointing method of individual sight collation in addition to being the most exasperating kind of ordeal is subject to much error. As an alternative, one can, after devising a system of shorthand designations to accommodate everything appearing on the printed page and to separate homonyms and comparable similarities arising from verbalized symbols, read a text into a tape recorder and then listen to himself as he collates one text after another. I have resorted to this method for a very long work of fiction and then abandoned the idea after discovering that the only truly predictable result was to put the operator to sleep. A much better approach was to design an instrument that would virtually — that is, optically — juxtapose a segment from one text with the corresponding segment from another. In theory, the idea is promising: the image of a small portion of text matter — preferably a single line length — from one text together with the image of the corresponding passage from a second text are through a system of right-angle prisms placed side by side, or juxtaposed with as little white space between them as possible. The observer will then see the texts through his peripheral vision if he looks steadily at an imaginary line drawn between the two lines of text. A shift in the juxtaposed matter to bring new text into view is accomplished not by optics but by moving the text pages around manually. In practice, however, it is necessary to locate corresponding words from the two texts by eye movement, not by peripheral vision, a routine that often requires the observer to compare a word found in one text at the left margin but at the right margin in the other text. While the comparison of most prose passages may be somewhat tedious, this instrument permits, on the other hand, very rapid and accurate comparison of text containing completed lines between page margins, namely, the text of verse and portions of plays. Figure 2 illustrates the arrangement of prisms and texts for the Mark II Comparator. The housing for the various components can be conceived from any of a number of design viewpoints. The portions of texts viewed and the juxtaposition they achieve cannot be made apparent except through a depiction such as that in Figure 3. Here the "picture window" that is seen by the operator corresponds to the top flat surface of Prism B in Figure 2, and the thin line drawn through the center is actually the righthand edge of Prism C. This line separates the images from the two texts and corresponds to the imaginary line mentioned above in my theoretical explanation of this instrument. (In the illustration only two juxtaposed lines of sample text are shown: additional text matter in the area would also be visible if the window were not masked to reveal only the center area.) The exact matter viewed through the window can be shifted by moving the texts along their platforms by introducing rails for this purpose. A second set of rails, but for just one of the texts, extending the other direction at a 90° angle will permit the sideways movement of one text so that its words can be matched up to word position in the other text. This refinement effectively minimizes the amount of eye movement necessary in comparing a word located at one margin in one text but at the opposite margin in the other text. Finally, since once again there are two focal lengths to contend with, adjustment for this factor is made by moving Prism A along its plane, closer to or farther away from the observer. As with the Mark I Comparator, a brief study here of the illustrations will reveal the origin and problem of focal length discrepancies arising from the differing distances from the eye of the two portions of text matter viewed. It is at once obvious from Figure 2 that it is better to work with photocopies since they are easier to position and move about than the actual books. Also, if the books themselves are used it is necessary to shift frequently the prisms (or front surface mirrors, if preferred) to keep both texts in identical focus. Mounting the platforms for the texts on guides or rails permits the operator, after he acquires lost ambidexterity, to move the texts along at the necessarily differing intervals as he drops down the page of text, line by line. Because an extra set of prisms is introduced into the optical system to allow viewing at a comfortable angle (an innovation that increases the focal length), it is desirable to introduce compensatory magnification into the apparatus, thus making the perceived images larger and bringing the whole performance closer to the phenomenon described above as that experienced when one is using his peripheral vision. Since the laws of optics forbid a magnifier exceeding a four inch or so diameter, and the average line length of a printed page exceeds that measurement, one of the large flat magnifying plastic sheets constructed on the Fresnel lens principle can be used, although there is some attending distortion — produced from the concentric rings of a Fresnel lens — to become accustomed to. Finally, masking or housing the prism system wherever appropriate will keep out all unwanted ambient light from the area of the prisms. The two Comparators I have described, if constructed with an appreciation for optical precision and the rather disturbing effects experienced when images are not in focus, will provide the user with rapid, accurate, portable, and inexpensive collating instruments. In using these instruments, as well as others recently described to the profession, one risks only the temporary notoriety that is the bane of the innovator. The Mark I Comparator has recently been redesigned for the purpose of production in quantity, and three separate models are currently proposed, each conforming to the distinct purpose for which the instrument is intended. The redesign and manufacture of the instrument was in response to the specific request by colleagues in textual studies after they had witnessed the performance of the Comparator. The result of this public exposure of the instrument has been the complete reaffirmation of previous test results and the unqualified performance as described in this paper. Additional information on the availability of the Mark I Comparator can be obtained from its designer and developer.</field>

Manuals for users of U.S. Army stereoscopes — which employ for an entirely different purpose the optical principle of my Mark I Comparator — state that the experience of non-convergent viewing, or looking into infinity, will not produce eyestrain for anyone having normal eyesight, whether natural or corrected. In fact, it is suggested by these manuals that operating this kind of instrument develops and strengthens the eyes. One ought, however, to place a restriction on the number of hours of operation at the instrument without interruption or rest (as must be done with most optical devices), depending on individual factors affecting efficiency. 8 The texts used range from George Chapman's The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1598) to E. E. Cummings' The Enormous Room (1922).</field>
