      <field name="fulltext">In the history of textual criticism, as of most human affairs, a few basic viewpoints have moved through the centuries in cyclical fashion, each losing favor temporarily in one area or another and then returning to prominence in an altered form. The fields concerned with reconstructing the past, like textual criticism, constantly reverberate with alternating claims about the place of judgment in the process. At one moment, objectivity seems possible, and artifacts tell their own stories with little or no assistance; at the next moment, subjectivity is welcomed, and artifacts are a springboard for the historical imagination. In the nineteenth century, for example, the genealogical approach to biblical and classical textual criticism, now associated with the name of Karl Lachmann, emerged from a desire to minimize the role of judgment in combining readings from variant texts and was thus a reaction to the less disciplined eclecticism of many eighteenth-century editors, who often altered texts according to their personal tastes. By the early twentieth century, in turn, there were efforts—as in the work of A. E. Housman—to reinstate an open acceptance of judgment. But even Housman's brilliant advocacy of the subjective element in textual criticism did not prevent several determined attempts in the twentieth century to develop mathematical procedures for weighing variants in ancient texts. A distrust of subjectivity, in a different form from Lachmann's, came in the twentieth century to dominate the study of medieval writings: the procedure, which was anti-eclectic, involved selecting a "best text" and altering it only at the places that seemed obviously erroneous. Although, for post-medieval literature, the term "best text" has not been widely used, the term "copy-text" as employed by R. B. McKerrow in his 1904 edition of Thomas Nashe meant essentially the same thing. Thus the editing of Renaissance literature that proceeded alongside the "New Bibliography" emerged from this restrictive base—not unexpectedly, since what was new in the "New Bibliography" (developed by McKerrow, A. W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and their followers) was the analysis of the physical details of books for evidence that could solve textual cruxes without the use of literary judgment (or at least limit the role of such judgment in making textual decisions). No approach to editing can totally eliminate judgment, of course; and I am less concerned here with the amount of judgment that actually entered into various editors' work than with the general avoidance or acceptance of judgment embodied in their editorial theories. McKerrow, by the end of his life in 1940, had moved toward a greater willingness to allow variants from one text to be incorporated into a chosen copy-text, as he outlined his plans for an edition of Shakespeare. But it remained for W. W. Greg in 1949 to enunciate, in his famous lecture "The Rationale of Copy-Text," a position for the editing of Renaissance drama that approached Housman's of a half-century earlier for the editing of classical literature. Greg, like Housman, elevated the role of informed judgment in choosing among variant readings. 1 One of the most revealing facts about his rationale, however, is—as the title of his paper suggests—its retention of a concept of "copy-text," a basic text into which alterations (or "emendations") 2 can be incorporated. It now seems time, after another half-century, to move beyond this often useful but nevertheless inherently restrictive concept. That Greg's intention was to liberate editorial judgment is indicated by his warning against "what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text"; but his recognition that a copy-text could indeed tyrannize did not cause him to abandon the concept. He was not quite ready to carry to its logical conclusion the dominant twentieth-century English line of thinking about the textual criticism of post-medieval literature, a line that had become gradually more liberal during the first half of the century—though the position he did take certainly constituted an important extension of it. Greg's rationale has been much debated in the succeeding half-century, but the discussions have generally focused on his recommendations for selecting and emending a copy-text rather than on the necessity for designating a particular text as copy-text in the first place. To consider the latter issue is not to imply any repudiation of Greg at all; rather, living with his ideas for a considerable period has enabled us to see more clearly their essential direction and has put us in a position to understand how, paradoxically, a reduction of emphasis on "copy-text" actually builds on and completes his argument.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The first step in thinking through a new approach to the question of copy-text is to examine whether there is a future for critical editions—editions, that is, in which the editors, using their informed critical judgment, make alterations in the documentary forms of texts that have come down to us (or at least allow themselves the freedom to make such alterations, whether or not they ultimately find any changes to be necessary). All the various "best-text" or "copy-text" theories are concerned with the process of altering documentary texts; but if a convincing argument can be made that no such process is justified, then there is no point considering critical editing further. In the continual give-and-take of arguments over subjectivity and objectivity, some scholars naturally take the position that editions presenting critical texts are less valuable (if granted any value at all) than editions containing facsimile or diplomatic (or computer "hypertext") reproductions of texts as they appear in extant documents. 3 The late twentieth century has seen an energetic resurgence of this view, springing from two seemingly contradictory premises. One—that authors do not control either the language they use or the forces that allow their work to reach the public—denigrates the significance of authorial intention and thus brings renewed attention to texts as they were published. The other premise—that the process of revision and change through which verbal works move is of more valid concern than any single final text that may be postulated—causes increased interest to be directed toward the texts of every prepublication draft and revised edition. Although the former premise tends to reject the author and the latter to concentrate exclusively on the author, both reflect disaffection with critical editing as a supposedly authoritarian imposition of stasis on inherently unstable material. 4 These trends have therefore publicized specific programmatic reasons for the production of facsimile and diplomatic editions, besides the obvious general motivation to make widely available the texts of unique manuscripts and scarce printed editions (recognizing, of course, that no photograph or transcription can preserve all the physical evidence of the original—and that all of it may be relevant to textual study). 5 Although facsimile and diplomatic editions are noncritical in that their editors' aim is to reproduce without alteration the words and punctuation of documentary texts, critical judgment is inevitably involved in deciphering handwritten (or poorly printed) texts and in deciding which documentary versions of a work to present (if all are not to be included). Because this decision-making is not intended to alter texts, however, the editions that result are usually thought of as more "objective," despite the number of subjective decisions that may have been involved; and although arguments about the relative amounts of subjectivity and objectivity in editing are normally concerned with critical editions, there is no doubt that those persons who wish to minimize subjectivity in critical editing should logically be drawn to noncritical editions. Facsimile and diplomatic editions, whatever subjectivity may underlie them, are fundamentally different in conception from editions in which the goal is to alter documentary texts according to some predetermined guideline. By not requiring such guidelines, they have seemed to need less discussion over the years than have critical editions; and their increased presence in recent methodological debates is to be welcomed as a partial redressing of the balance. There is no question that they serve an important function in the study of the past. But any attempt to argue that they are necessarily superior to critical editions, or indeed that they constitute the only legitimate kind of edition, cannot possibly succeed. The two kinds must always coexist, for they represent two indispensable elements in approaching the past: the ordered presentation of artifactual evidence, and the creation, from that evidence, of versions of past moments that are intended to be more comprehensively faithful than the artifacts themselves—random (and perhaps damaged) survivors as they are. It is not possible, in any case, to prevent human beings from interpreting evidence; to ban critical editions would be as futile as to try to suppress any other product that reflects the natural working of the mind. Critical editions, however, are not merely inevitable; they are desirable. A text reconstructed by a person who is immersed in, and has thought deeply about, the body of surviving evidence relevant to a work, its author, and its time may well teach the rest of us something we could not have discovered for ourselves, even if the reconstruction can never be definitive—and even if, indeed, it places us in a position to criticize its own constitution. Authorially intended texts, which have been the goal of almost all critical editions in the past, cannot be expected to reside, in perfect accuracy, in surviving documents—or perhaps, for that matter, in any documents that ever existed. But the fact that they are not—and possibly never were—fully available in physical form does not deprive them of the status of historical events. (The same could of course be said of texts as intended by publishers or any of the other individuals that had a hand in the production process.) 6 Some people may not be interested in reconstructing such events, but their lack of interest cannot render the effort invalid. There is another reason that critical editions are essential: they are demanded by the very nature of verbal works. Like musical and choreographic works—and unlike works of visual and plastic art—verbal works employ an intangible medium. Any tangible representation of such a work—as in letterforms on paper—cannot be the work itself, just as choreographic notation or traditional musical scores are not works of dance or music. The media involved—language, movement, and sound—being intangible, these works can be stored only through conversion to another form, which in effect becomes a set of instructions for reconstituting the works. 7 Any instructions—indeed, any kind of reproduction or report—may be inaccurate, and thus every attempt to reconstruct such works (or versions of works) must include a readiness to recognize textual errors in their stored forms. Understanding the difference between works and documents also enables one to see that a concern with the integrity of discrete versions is not incompatible with the adoption of variants from different documents. 8 Reconstituting works (or versions) in intangible media is a critical activity, and universal agreement about their makeup cannot be expected. But if we wish to experience the texts of works (or versions), and not simply the texts of documents, we must leave the certainty (or relative certainty) of the documentary texts for the uncertainty of our reconstructions. 9 Every act of reading is in fact an act of critical editing: we often call critical essays "readings," and critical editions are also the records of readings. The editors who produce them earn the respect of other readers to the extent that their work reflects historical learning and literary sensitivity; but no reader is likely to agree with every decision made by any other reader, even the most respected critical editor. The process of critical editing is the ineluctable, if unending, effort to surmount the limitations of artifacts in the pursuit of works from the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Having established the necessity of critical editions, one can then consider what procedure should be followed in making the critical judgments they entail. Some kind of guideline is required if the operation is to be disciplined and historically oriented. Otherwise, textual decisions would simply reflect the editors' own preferences, and the results, which would not necessarily be without interest, would not be an attempt at historical reconstruction. Editorial taste is indeed essential, but an edited text should reflect, not the personal preferences of the editor, but the editor's judgments regarding the preferences of the author, or the author in conjunction with others, at a given moment. Simple as this distinction is, it has probably been the root of more textual disputes than any other single point. But since critical editing must rest on editorial judgment, a sufficient guideline would seem to be one that states the goal toward which that judgment is to be directed, perhaps indicating what ancillary information should be taken into account but without placing limits on the judgment itself: to say, for example, that an editor's literary sensitivity, informed by biographical, bibliographical, and more broadly historical research, should be employed to attempt to determine the constitution of texts at particular past moments. The fear that encouraging editorial judgment would amount to licensing personal preference, however, has repeatedly caused textual theorists to impose restrictions on the field within which editorial judgment is allowed to operate. The "best-text" theories are one result, and they have been curiously persistent, despite the ease with which their essential illogic can be exposed. In ruling that texts can be altered only where they are obviously incorrect, this approach seems to imply, incredibly, that texts are likely to be correct wherever they are not manifestly incorrect—a patent absurdity. A. E. Housman in 1903 pointed out this flaw most memorably, in the preface to the first volume of his edition of Manilius, and he wittily added, "assuredly there is no trade on earth, excepting textual criticism, in which the name of prudence would be given to that habit of mind which in ordinary human life is called credulity." 10 Perhaps the most basic way of stating the incoherence of the "best-text" approach is to observe that it begins with a belief that documentary texts can be improved through editorial intervention (otherwise there would be no reason to allow the correction of clearcut errors) but proceeds to cast doubt on the usefulness of such intervention (otherwise it would be allowed to operate more widely). If there were a chance that editorial judgment could correct a text at places not obviously incorrect, there would seem to be no reason not to sanction the effort; and one must therefore conclude, with Housman, that these places are assumed to be correct. Actually, however, there is no point looking for an explanation of this unreasoned approach other than a reflex reaction: the belief that a restriction of judgment was required to improve on the unscholarly eclecticism of the past. McKerrow was undoubtedly caught up in this reaction when in 1904 he chose the second edition of Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller as his copy-text, to be altered only at obviously erroneous points, on the grounds that it contained some revisions by the author (2: 197). He was not happy with all the readings that this policy forced him to retain, but he felt that he had "no choice" in the matter; when he stated that an editor could not "pick and choose among the variant readings of his author's works those which he himself would prefer in writings of his own," McKerrow did not admit the possibility that choice among variants could be performed on any other basis. 11 Thirty-five years later, in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939), he took the significant step of recommending a limited eclecticism: he asserted that an editor could best approach the goal of reconstructing "an author's fair copy" by using as copy-text the earliest authoritative edition (which would supply spelling and punctuation closer to the author's than a later edition would be likely to contain) and inserting into it the substantive alterations from a later edition (p. 18). But once editorial judgment had determined the presence of an author's hand in a later edition, McKerrow would allow judgment to operate no further, claiming that "we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints." He was clearly still under the spell of the "best-text" fallacy; and it was at this point that Greg stepped in to observe that alterations in a later edition may come from various sources and that it is essential to make discriminations among them. 12 Greg's primary purpose in "The Rationale of Copy-Text" was to provide a sound argument for greater editorial freedom of choice. 13 "I am only concerned," he unambiguously proclaimed, "to uphold his [the editor's] liberty of judgment" (p. 386); at another point he called it "disastrous" to "curb the liberty of competent editors" (p. 388). He asked why, if judgment was to be admitted in distinguishing possible from impossible readings (as it was in the "best-text" approaches), "should the choice between possible readings be withdrawn from its competence?" (p. 381). The judgment of an editor, he answered, "is likely to bring us closer to what the author wrote than the enforcement of an arbitrary rule." Curiously, however, Greg's strong endorsement of editorial freedom in regard to substantive variants was not extended to what he called "accidentals" (spelling and punctuation), for it was the function of the copy-text, in his view, to provide the accidentals. He made a clear distinction between the nearly automatic acceptance of copy-text accidentals and the use of judgment in dealing with substantives: "the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but . . . the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism" (pp. 381-382). He was well aware of the fact that, if one considered it possible to evaluate the authority of accidentals, there would be no need to designate any text as a "copy-text" possessing presumptive authority. As he said in his sketch of the history of textual criticism at the beginning of the essay, "So long as purely eclectic methods prevailed, any preference for one manuscript over another, if it showed itself, was of course arbitrary" (p. 374). The "purely eclectic methods" he referred to were those founded on personal taste; but the point would be equally valid for any approach in which all choices among variants could be settled through the exercise of some kind of judgment. Greg's acceptance of McKerrow's idea of a copy-text, therefore, was founded on a belief that there was usually insufficient evidence for reasoning about accidentals. It seems evident, nevertheless, that Greg was not entirely comfortable with the idea of restricting the role of judgment in any aspect of the editorial procedure. He inserted the word "generally" in his directive that "the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals"; and he insisted that the copy-text should not be "sacrosanct, even apart from the question of substantive variation," enumerating instances in which it is "within the discretion of an editor" to alter copy-text accidentals. He even went so far as to say that, in regard to "graphic peculiarities" (by which he meant some practices of spelling and punctuation), "the copy-text is only one among others" (pp. 385-386). If, therefore, copy-text accidentals may be altered whenever one believes there is good reason to do so, just as copy-text substantives may certainly be, the role of the copy-text turns out to be that of supplying readings (of both substantives and accidentals) whenever there seems no other basis for deciding. Greg would never have insisted that any reading should be retained simply because it was present in the copy-text, if an editor's informed judgment pointed to a different choice; such "tyranny of the copy-text" (p. 382) 14 was what he was striving to eliminate from textual criticism. Thus if one is to fall back on the copy-text (for accidentals as well as substantives) only when there is no other way to choose, the key element in his copy-text procedure is determining when two readings are in fact "exactly balanced" (p. 386)—or, to use the more famous term that he also employs, "completely indifferent" (p. 387). If, in an editor's view, there are no completely indifferent alternatives, then there is no need for a copy-text. 15 Greg himself was, however, somewhat tyrannized by the idea of copy-text, for his essay includes this statement: "whenever there is more than one substantive text of comparable authority, then although it will still be necessary to choose one of them as copy-text, and to follow it in accidentals, this copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority as far as substantive readings are concerned" (pp. 384-385). Thus at the very moment when he emphasizes the necessity for freedom of editorial judgment in regard to substantive variants from documents of equal "extrinsic" (that is, genealogical) authority, he places a mechanical, unreasoned restriction on judgment applied to the accidentals. When the surviving texts of a work form an ancestral series and a copy-text is chosen for its position in the series, there is a justification for falling back on the copy-text when the variants seem indifferent. But when the documents do not form such a series, and when two of them seem evenly balanced in authority, there is no reason to give more weight to the accidentals in one; the fact that there is often little basis for making decisions about accidentals does not in such an instance justify assigning authority to the accidentals that happen to be in a single document. Greg criticized editors for "abdicating" the "editorial function" if in the case of substantives "of equal extrinsic authority" they relied "on some arbitrary canon, such as the authority of the copy-text" (p. 384). But he was giving them contrary advice for the accidentals. It was after this passage, however, that he sanctioned the alteration of copy-text accidentals—presumably in both kinds of situations, both where texts can be ranked on genealogical grounds and where two or more authoritative texts appear unrankable. Thus the overriding point is the necessity for editorial judgment, which must operate regardless of the relationships among the documents; and the idea of a copy-text (feasible for ancestral series but meaningless for texts of equal authority, which offer no basis for generalizing about their readings as a whole) is not really central to the argument. Although Greg wished to warn editors about "the mesmeric influence of the copy-text" (p. 383), he did not entirely escape it himself, for his injection of the concept into his discussion ironically interfered with the full expression of a theory of editorial freedom for scholarly editing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The voluminous commentary engendered by Greg's essay has largely been concerned with the applicability of his approach beyond the field of Renaissance drama and with the appropriateness of concentrating on final authorial intention. 16 Most commentators have spent less time scrutinizing the general principles underlying Greg's recommendations than evaluating how useful those specific recommendations seem in different contexts, and thus there has been almost no questioning of the necessity for a concept of copy-text. The basic meaning of the term "copy-text" has remained stable from McKerrow's time onward—that is, the documentary text used as the basis for a scholarly edition. But the way in which a copy-text is selected and emended has undergone a remarkable shift during the twentieth century; and when the phrase "copy-text editing" is now used it signifies not what McKerrow would have understood by it but generally something close to what Greg meant by it. Being a critic of "copy-text editing" —and there have been many such critics in recent years—is likely to mean disapproving of the elevation of texts as completed by authors over texts as they emerged from publication or theatrical production, or objecting to the preference for the author's final intention rather than an earlier intention, or indeed decrying the practice of eclectic editing itself. But criticizing "copy-text editing" has not meant attacking the idea of copy-text. Whether or not editors of post-medieval writings have been successful in avoiding the "tyranny of the copy-text" as envisaged by Greg, they have not escaped the tyranny of the concept of copy-text. Perhaps the most instructive example is Fredson Bowers, since he was the most prolific and influential editor of this century in the English-speaking scholarly world. He was also the person primarily responsible for the extension of Greg's ideas to the editing of post-Renaissance literature, and therefore one might think it unreasonable to expect that he would have been critical of "copy-text." Yet he was an ardent believer in the importance of critical judgment in editing, and he did not hesitate to point out what he saw as limitations in Greg's rationale; thus his failure to question the need for a copy-text does show what Greg had called the mesmerizing power of the concept. As cases in point, one may turn to two of his essays from the 1970s, "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text" (1972) and "Greg's 'Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited" (1978), 17 which are among the most trenchant analyses that Greg's ideas have received and constitute Bowers's principal reconsideration of his earlier, less measured, response to the "Rationale." The first of these essays, after sketching Greg's contribution 18 and some of Bowers's own applications of Greg's rationale to later literature, takes up instances of thoroughgoing authorial revision, a subject not dealt with by Greg in much detail. In such cases, Bowers says, when "the two texts are parallel enough for a comparison of the accidentals to be pertinent," an editor "can make some essay at treating the accidentals of the revised edition on the same critical basis as its substantives" (p. 462). What the editor must not do, Bowers insists, is "to succumb to the tyranny of the copy-text." If all variants—accidentals as well as substantives—are treated critically, Bowers recognizes that "in an ideal state" the editor "would arrive at compatible results without regard for the choice of copy-text" (pp. 462-463): The edited text would not differ in the least, but only in apparatus. Thus I return to my original suggestion that the choice of copy-text for revised editions should actually be motivated by practical convenience, not by ideological considerations. (p. 463) A major element in this "practical convenience" turns out to be conciseness of the apparatus. Actually the choice of copy-text would not necessarily affect the length of the apparatus, though it could frequently do so if one were using the style of apparatus Bowers generally employed. But the main point is that if a shortening of apparatus is accomplished by presenting less information (as it is in Bowers's system), one is in the odd position of claiming that the purpose of selecting a copy-text is to withhold textual evidence from the reader. 19 In fact Bowers proceeds to point out, both in a footnote on this passage and in the following paragraph, that only in an ideal world would the choice of copy-text not affect the resulting edited text—but in that case the choice is not simply "motivated by practical convenience" after all, since the text is affected by it. Yet at the end of the paragraph, Bowers comes back to the matter of convenience, saying that a revised edition should be chosen as copy-text "only in cases of the sternest necessity when to select an earlier document would pile up lists of emendations of staggering proportions" (p. 464). Exactly what function a copy-text plays is finally unclear in this discussion, but the idea that there must be a copy-text of some sort seems never in doubt. In the second essay, six years later, Bowers gives Greg's "Rationale" a more critical reading, examines its applicability to authorially revised editions of later periods (in the light of his own further experience), and finds that he has a "serious quarrel" with Greg's belief in "the lesser authority of a revised edition in cases of doubt" (p. 123). Although he is convinced that Greg's idea of choosing a copy-text for its accidentals is "still (and no doubt invariably) sound . . . for any period" (p. 147), he concludes that the greater accuracy of compositors in periods after the Renaissance means that indifferent substantive variants in revised editions of the last three centuries may generally be regarded as more likely to be authorial than compositorial (p. 155). There is an irony here in Bowers's partial return to McKerrow's belief in the whole body of substantive variants of a revised edition. Bowers's position is more flexible, but there is considerable similarity between McKerrow's idea of adopting all the variants when some are certainly authorial and Bowers's newly formed conviction of the likelihood "that an indifferent variant in the revised text is authorial" (p. 155). Bowers even admits the possibility that this view may apply to accidentals as well as substantives (depending on one's judgment of compositorial fidelity) and thus that the revised text could become the copy-text (p. 160). But given his recognition that copy-text accidentals as well as substantives can be altered by the editor (e.g., pp. 128-129, 148-149), along with his willingness to make distinctions even among what he labels "indifferent" variants (rendering them in fact no longer indifferent), 20 one begins to wonder what is left of the concept of a copy-text as a fall-back position. That this concept is the ostensible focus of the essay reveals its tyrannizing powers, for the real subject is—as it must be in an approach that stresses judgment—the process of active decision-making. Bowers was willing—as he put it at the end of the essay—to "reverse Greg's principle for any period after the Renaissance"; but he was apparently not ready to demote the idea of denominating one text as the copy-text in every instance. This reluctance is most dramatically revealed in his treatment of so-called "radiating texts"—texts that do not form an ancestral linear series but instead represent independent lines of descent from a common source. This kind of textual history is frequently encountered in the study of the manuscript traditions of ancient texts, but Bowers's attention was drawn to it by his editing of Stephen Crane, whose syndicated newspaper pieces provide a classically pure example of the problem: the various original newspaper texts of a piece are independently derived from (and equidistant from) the master copy supplied by the syndicate office to the subscribing newspapers. In the absence of such master copy, the syndicated appearances—"radiating" from the lost original—constitute the only evidence for reconstructing what the syndicate office sent out (which is, in turn, at least one step removed from Crane's lost manuscripts). In the fifth and sixth volumes of his Crane edition ( Tales of Adventure and Tales of War , both 1970), Bowers first dealt with this situation extensively. 21 His procedure, at points of variation in punctuation among the radiating texts, was generally to adopt the reading present in the largest number of them (though he recognized that not every instance could be handled on a quantitative basis); and then he selected as a copy-text the single newspaper text that contained the largest number of the readings that he had decided to adopt. As he says in discussing "The Pace of Youth," the first of the pieces in Tales of Adventure , the Dayton Daily Journal text "has been selected as copy-text for its general concurrence with majority opinion" (p. cxlii). This use of "copy-text" of course shifts the meaning of the term from what Greg (and Bowers in earlier discussions) had meant by it—for here it does not designate a text that can be accorded presumptive authority by virtue of its genealogical position, since all the radiating texts are equidistant from the copy furnished by the author. Instead of a copy-text that helps one to resolve cruxes, it is now one that is selected after the cruxes have been resolved. The problem emerges even more clearly in Bowers's account of the next piece, "One Dash—Horses," where he designates the syndicate master proof as the copy-text (even though it does not survive), because it is "the earliest recoverable archetype," and he is then driven to use the term "physical copy-text itself" for the one newspaper text that is "perhaps the closest in its accidentals to the lost master proof" (p. cxlvii). Tales of War also includes instances in which Bowers, after pointing out that several newspaper texts are "technically" of equal authority, chooses one as copy-text for its "convenience"—the convenience stemming from the fact that the text chosen (to quote his statement in one case) "is generally less in need of accidentals emendation" (p. cxi). 22 The conceptual imprecision in this shifting use of "copy-text" probably had little effect on Bowers's final text, since his copy-texts in these instances were chosen not for their authority but for the extent of their agreement with what he had already decided the text should contain. Nevertheless, the fuzziness surrounding "copy-text" here does have practical consequences for the reader, through its effect on the apparatus. Because the list of emendations provides a record of editorial alterations made in the designated copy-texts, and because the "historical collation" records only substantive variants, the variants in accidentals among the radiating texts are not fully reported. Bowers does say, in his headnote to the emendations list in both of these Crane volumes, "when as in syndicated newspaper versions a number of texts have equal claim to authority, all are noted in the Emendations listing" (5:211; 6:335). What this statement means is that a full record of variants in accidentals is normally 23 provided for each place where the designated copy-text is emended; but any variants in accidentals at places where the copy-text is not emended remain unreported. Yet the documentary authority of those variants is the same as that of the reported ones, given the genealogical equality of all the radiating texts. Thus the reader is deprived of some of the evidence from the texts that collectively form the primary authority in these cases. That Bowers himself sometimes thought of a group of radiating texts as a kind of collective copy-text is suggested by an instance in "One Dash-Horses" where he retains the designated copy-text's capitalization of "North" but says that it "may most properly be regarded as an emendation" (p. 199)—and then includes it (with " stet ") in his list of emendations (p. 213). In short, the importation of a concept of copy-text into these situations is more productive of confusion than of clarity. Bowers's primary theoretical discussion of radiating texts occurs not in the Crane edition but in the latter half of his essay on "Multiple Authority," where it constitutes his principal supplement to Greg—since it, unlike most of his other treatments of copy-text, focuses on a situation that Greg did not attempt to cover. But his discussion, pioneering as it is in many ways, is weakened by his retention of the idea of a copy-text, especially after having in effect shown why it is irrelevant. He emphasizes, quite properly, the role of critical judgment, pointing out that for radiating texts it must be applied as fully to accidentals as to substantives. 24 A statistical approach, he rightly asserts, is not sufficient, for an unconventional authorial reading might be normalized by many compositors and "preserved only by the dogged or indifferent few"; "the minority reading may sometimes need to be adopted on critical grounds" (p. 468). This cogent reasoning implies the importance of recording all the variant readings in radiating texts; and it is therefore revealing of his divided mind that he proceeds to advocate choosing a copy-text "requiring the least amount of apparatus" (p. 471). 25 He recognizes the reasons for dispensing with the concept of copy-text altogether in such situations: if there are eight radiating texts, he says, the copy-text is "only one of eight equal witnesses, of no greater presumptive authority than the other seven" (p. 470); the choice of copy-text, then, is "theoretically indifferent" and "largely a question of convenience"; it is made only after the critical text has already been constructed (p. 471), and it is "not integral to the editing" (p. 485). He is therefore receptive to the possibility of having no copy-text; yet he maintains that a copy-text be chosen "to serve as the physical basis" (p. 471) for a critically reconstructed text, without making clear why the "physical basis" must be equated with a single document, when in fact it is a group of documents. The idea that there must be a copy-text was so firmly rooted in his mind that the only alternative he saw to selecting a single radiating text was to have a "non-extant copy-text" (p. 471), in Crane's case the lost syndicate master proofs as reconstructed from the radiating texts. To cling to a concept of "copy-text" even if it comes to mean the same thing as the scholar's reconstructed text is surely the ultimate in being tyrannized by the idea of having something called "copy-text." At the end of the essay Bowers says that to try applying Greg's rationale to radiating-text situations "would establish a real tyranny of the copy-text"; but Bowers (like Greg before him) was not able, even while warning others about this tyranny, to shake himself entirely free from its bonds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Two years after Bowers's essay, I called attention to the inappropriateness of trying to employ in radiating-text situations the kind of apparatus that had become standard, under Bowers's influence, for use with linear genealogies. Although he recognized that Greg's "Rationale" did not apply to radiating texts, he apparently could not bring himself to accept fully the fact that an apparatus reflecting this rationale would not do so, either. It is noteworthy that when, in "Multiple Authority," he shrank from the notion of a "non-extant copy-text" his stated reason was not conceptual but the belief that "the problem of what form an apparatus would take for such a non-extant copy-text is acute" (p. 471). Actually, as I tried to show, there is nothing complicated in simply listing all the variants (in both substantives and accidentals) in all the radiating texts and keying this single list to the newly constructed critical text. 26 Such a list emphasizes that the critical text has been built up from the evidence of all the radiating texts and was not produced by making alterations in one of them. The only sense in which the latter operation could be said to have occurred is that some form of reproduction (xerographic, say, or photographic) of one of the texts may have been marked to produce a document that could be handed to the printer of the new scholarly text. Bowers was of course well aware, in other discussions, of the significant difference between a copy-text in Greg's sense and a printer's copy for a scholarly edition. 27 Yet his recommendation to choose a single documentary text from a group of radiating texts, and call it a "copy-text," amounts to equating "copy-text" with "printer's copy"—while at the same time elevating it undeservedly to unique historical status by reporting its variants fully (and not those of any other text). There is no escaping the fact that radiating texts equidistant from their common ancestor provide no text to serve as copy-text; and it is further true that this lack does not prevent an editor from constructing a critical text—as Bowers did before he chose a copy-text—or from preparing an apparatus recording all the rejected variants. Once one accepts these points, one may begin to see that the thinking involved in radiating-text situations is applicable to all critical editing. Every choice made among variants in radiating texts is an active critical choice; no reading is settled on by default, for there is no text that offers a fall-back position. When the variants in radiating texts seem "indifferent," an editor may of course choose a reading from the text that supplies the largest number of other readings; but the decision is still an active one, in which one of the factors taken into account is the apparent general reliability of a particular text. The process remains one of building up a new text rather than making changes in an old one. If this idea—that critical editing is constructive rather than emendatory—were also applied to texts in linear genealogies, the role of judgment might more clearly be seen as dominant, and any practical guideline (such as Greg's rationale) might be better recognized as an aid to judgment, not a brake on it. An editor, for example, who is following Greg in according presumptive authority to the text closest to a lost manuscript, would—following this plan—speak not of "retaining" readings from that text but of "selecting" them. The notion that wisdom supports the idea of sticking to a copy-text when two readings are indifferent places the emphasis on the preservation of a documentary text; but the idea that a critical text emerges from active choices made among the variant readings (along with, of course, the editor's own inventions, when necessary) emphasizes editorial judgment. The difference between the two may at first seem slight, a matter of labeling: in the former, one lets a copy-text reading stand if the variant is indifferent and there is thus no compelling argument for altering it; in the latter, two readings that might otherwise be indifferent are not actually so, for the fact that one of them comes from a text of superior genealogical standing provides a reason for choosing it. But the difference between these two justifications for the same decision is not superficial: it goes to the heart of what critical editing is. The key point is not whether an editor would make the same decision by following Greg's rationale or by designating no copy-text but still following Greg's argument for the presumptive authority of the text closest to an authorial manuscript. No two editors can be expected to make the same choices by following either of these systems in any case. The important point is that the former approach places a rule above reason (as any recourse to a fall-back position must do), whereas the latter restructures the problem so that the editor's decision (even if it is the same decision) results from the positive step of taking a reasoned action. The controlling images of the two approaches are those of initially full and initially empty sheets of paper. If one chooses a copy-text, then in effect one begins with filled sheets and proceeds to alter the text present on them; but if one has no copy-text, one begins with blank sheets, so to speak, and fills them by placing one word after another on them, drawing those readings from the relevant documents (and, on occasion, from one's own mind). I am not suggesting, of course, that an editor should actually write out a text in this way; but I do believe that an appropriate analogy for the critical editor to have in mind is the medieval scribe taking readings from various manuscripts as he prepared a new manuscript. 28 It is ironic that in classic Lachmannian textual criticism this scribal practice is called "contamination," for some such process (supplemented by the editor's own inventions) provides our only hope for rising above the limitations of individual documents. Although the followers of Lachmann may often have deluded themselves about the objectivity of their own methods, their process of "recension," with its aggregating impulse, in many cases avoided the pitfalls of the "best-text" family of approaches and therefore holds a lesson for editors of works in the modern languages. The constructive approach I am outlining subsumes all the various points of view that can be taken toward the goal of editing. There is no reason, for example, why an editor interested in uninfluenced authorial final intention could not still follow Greg's rationale—which has proved itself effective for this purpose. But instead of treating one text as a copy-text, an editor would use the genealogical position—and thus the presumed authority—of that text as a factor in weighing each variant reading. Sometimes this factor would be decisive; sometimes other factors would be. The difference between this procedure and the conventional one is subtle but crucially significant. Genealogy is taken into account, but with judgment clearly in the dominant position. If, instead of uninfluenced authorial intention, one preferred to emphasize, say, the text that was the joint product of the author and the publisher's staff, one would then have a different attitude toward some of the first-edition readings that vary from manuscript readings (those, for instance, that seem to reflect house-styling). Or if one wished to focus on a stage that preceded a final version, the bulk of the text might be drawn from the document that provides the best evidence of the existence of such a stage, but not without a serious weighing of the claims of variants in other documents (since versions of works cannot be equated with the texts of particular documents). What I am suggesting is not a supplement or an alternative to Greg's rationale but an overarching framework that encompasses its goal and that of other rationales as well. Obviously one could rewrite Greg so as to focus on goals other than authorial intention; but the resulting series of copy-text rationales, each aiming at a different end-product, would still not avoid the restriction on editorial judgment inherent in Greg's rationale. What is needed instead is a framework that liberates editorial judgment from the concept of copy-text while being neutral in itself as to the goal toward which that judgment should be directed. 29 Despite the salutary emphasis of Greg and Bowers on editorial freedom, many editors are still—as Greg and Bowers were—in thrall to the notion, now about two centuries old, that responsibility in scholarly editing is, at least to some degree, incompatible with freedom of judgment. A passage in Bowers's "Multiple Authority" illustrates how inhibiting this attitude can sometimes be. Bowers claims that the evidence of the radiating newspaper texts of a Crane story enables one to attempt reconstructing the syndicate master proofs but offers no justification for pushing on back to Crane's manuscript. It is not the editor's concern, he says, "whether in their recovered form these proofs agree or disagree with Crane's habits of punctuation, spelling, and so on"; and he continues, more emphatically, to say that "it is not an editor's business to print what he may be morally certain the manuscript reading would have been when the evidence indicates strongly that the recovered proof read otherwise" (p. 473). 30 There may be good reason, of course, to be satisfied with having the text of the syndicate proofs; but if one is really interested in what Crane wrote in his manuscript, and if one's knowledge and judgment make one "morally certain" of being able to reconstruct it, why should one be prevented from doing so by the fact that one is going back two or more steps behind the preserved documents rather than just a single step? The "law" of "documentary evidence," to which Bowers appeals, is surely misapplied if it outlaws the responsible use of the historical imagination. The very existence of critical editing depends on recognizing that documentary texts may legitimately be overruled by informed judgment. Whether an editor is justified in attempting to reconstruct any given stage in a text's history depends on how the task is approached, on how the editor proposes to overcome the limitations of the documents; no a priori ruling can decree one stage to be a valid goal for the exercise of historical judgment and another to be inappropriate. On many other occasions, however, Bowers not only granted, but openly welcomed, the dominance of judgment—as when, in his edition of Tom Jones (1975), after saying that the textual situation was one in which "Greg's classic theory of copy-text must hold" (p. lxx), he declared that the operation of emendation "is a critical process almost exclusively" and that in such a process "the editor shoulders his proper responsibility" (p. lxxi). In a 1985 address he described Greg's rationale as "a discretionary principle, to be applied flexibly," and as a "liberation" from "mechanical conservatism," complaining that in America it was often used to justify "avoiding the unknown terrors of eclecticism." 31 Both Greg and Bowers unquestionably believed in the liberty of editorial judgment, but in their procedural statements they yoked this belief to a strategy that sprang ultimately from a contrary view, for they obviously carried with them just enough of an inherited distrust of judgment to make them not quite prepared for completing the long historical movement toward the full reinstatement of critical judgment in editing. What I am proposing here is a way to take that step without abandoning the responsibilities of scholarship. It might be called "constructive critical editing" to distinguish it from an approach that emphasizes emendation. To see critical editing as an activity of rebuilding rather than repairing forces the judgment to play its central role in recovering the past. All historical reconstruction requires judgment to enable one to decide what can be accepted as facts and what can reasonably be inferred from them by an informed imagination. Experiencing verbal works as communications from the past entails this kind of reconstruction not only because they are past events but also because they employ an intangible medium, language. Reading necessarily involves the use of judgment in the extracting of a work from a document. If editors' readings, enshrined in editions, are to be exemplary, they must arise from an active embracing of judgment—which is, after all, the only thing we have to rely on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper was presented as a Book Arts Press lecture during Rare Book School at the University of Virginia, 12 July 1993. 1 The developments summarized here are sketched more fully (with references to other accounts) in my "Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 36 (1983), 21-68; reprinted in Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (1990), pp. 274-321. 2 The term "emendation" has come to be used by editors of post-medieval literature to mean any alteration made in a copy-text by a critical editor—that is, alterations that derive from variants in other documentary texts and also alterations that originate with the editor. In the textual criticism of ancient writings, however, the term has traditionally been used to refer only to the editor's own innovations, introduced into a "recension" that resulted from an analysis of the variants in the documentary texts. This older tradition misleadingly encourages a belief that the process of recension is more objective than that of emendation (especially since the usual phrase is "conjectural emendation"), whereas the newer usage, which carries no such implication, is more realistic. This point is discussed more fully on pp. 25-27 [278-280] of the essay cited in the preceding note. 3 A "diplomatic" text is one that aims to reproduce without alteration the textual features of a document (primarily the words and punctuation), but not those features that can, in the particular instance, be regarded as nontextual (such as the letterforms or the page layout). See also note 7 below. 4 I have attempted to survey recent thinking along these lines in "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," SB , 44 (1991), 83-143. 5 See my "Reproductions and Scholarship," SB , 42 (1989), 25-54. Cf. note 7 below. 6 The difficulty of segregating the intentions of specific individuals will vary from one instance to another; but even when the difficulty seems extreme, there is no reason not to apply informed judgment to the attempt, if one is sufficiently interested. 7 Some works, of course, entail the combining (or "mixing") of media: thus there are instances in which works are partially verbal and partially visual, such as shaped or concrete poetry. The dividing line between what is textual and what is nontextual in the physical features of a document must be determined separately in each instance. Features judged to be nontextual (not part of the work) are not necessarily irrelevant as evidence for reconstructing the work; indeed, all physical characteristics of a document must be scrutinized carefully by the editor, since none can be automatically ruled out as unrelated to textual considerations. Cf. note 28 below. 8 The fear of "eclecticism"—expressed often in the history of scholarly editing—is generally based on a failure to understand that versions (like works) cannot be found in the texts of specific documents. The most extended discussion of eclecticism in editing is Fredson Bowers's "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof , 4 (1975), 31-76; reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 488-528. 9 For a fuller statement of the ideas outlined here, see my A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989). It is surprising that some textual critics label this view of literary works "Platonic." Recognition of the intangible nature of certain media is independent of a general belief in the secondary status of the physical world. A Platonist would of course take a Platonic view of both intangible and tangible media; but the concept of intangibility is not in itself Platonic. 10 This preface is conveniently excerpted in Housman's Selected Prose , ed. John Carter (1961), pp. 23-44 (quotation from p. 43) and in Collected Poems and Selected Prose , ed. Christopher Ricks (1988), pp. 372-386 (quotation not included.) 11 McKerrow's sentence ends with an unexceptionable statement of one editorial goal: "to present those [the author's] works as he believes the author to have intended them to appear." But McKerrow's point is only to distinguish between the editor's own preferences and the editor's conclusions as to what the author's preferences were; he does not acknowledge the role that editorial judgment, especially as applied to every variant individually, might play in moving toward his chosen goal. 12 For Fredson Bowers's fuller analysis of McKerrow's illogical caution, see "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," Shakespeare Quarterly , 6 (1955), 309-324. Bowers also explored some of Greg's differences from McKerrow in "McKerrow, Greg, and 'Substantive Edition,'" Library, 5th ser., 33 (1978), 83-107. 13 Greg's essay was first published in SB , 3 (1950-51), 19-36, and was reprinted in Greg's Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 374-391 (the latter text is cited here). The evolution of Greg's thought preceding this essay can be observed in his "McKerrow's Prolegomena Reconsidered," Review of English Studies , 17 (1941), 139-149, and in the prefaces to the first two printings of his The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942, 1951). 14 In the original publication of the "Rationale," Greg did not indicate that in saying "what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text" he was not inventing the phrase himself; but in an added footnote, included in the 1966 republication of the essay, he attributed it to Paul Maas, who had used it in a review ( Review of English Studies , 20 [1944], 76) of Greg's The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare when he was commenting on Greg's interest in preserving copy-text spelling. 15 In the course of one of the more incisive analyses of Greg's position, T. H. Howard-Hill distinguishes two senses of "indifferent," one referring to the inability of an editor to judge between two readings and the other referring to the equal authority of the sources from which two readings come. In the practice of editing, however, these meanings must merge, since one's judgment of a reading takes the source of the reading into account, and one's evaluation of a source involves an analysis of its readings. See his "Modern Textual Theories and the Editing of Plays," Library , 6th ser., 11 (1989), 89-115; and my discussion of it in "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (note 4 above), pp. 122-128 (esp. p. 123 and footnote 60). Tom Davis, in an earlier cogent discussion of Greg's rationale, also examines the crucial matter of what it means to label a variant "indifferent," suggesting that this action reinforces "the tyranny of the copy-text"; see "The CEAA and Modern Textual Editing," Library , 5th ser., 32 (1977), 61-74 (esp. pp. 69-71), and my comments on it in "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," SB , 34 (1981), 23-65 (esp. pp. 40-42), reprinted in Textual Criticism since Greg (1987), pp. 65-107 (esp. pp. 82-84). 16 For an evaluative survey of the commentary, see my Textual Criticism since Greg (1987), supplemented by the essay cited in note 4 above. 17 The first, a paper read before the Bibliographical Society in London, was published in the Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115, and was reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 447-487 (the text cited here). The second paper was published in SB , 31 (1978), 90-161. 18 At one point (p. 459) Bowers says that before Greg the conservative position regarding the accidentals of a revised edition (essentially McKerrow's belief that they must be accepted) was "partly based on despair." Yet Greg's different recommendation—to follow the accidentals of the unrevised edition—was equally uncritical and equally a counsel of despair, founded in part—as Greg said—on "philological ignorance" (p. 377). Both positions illustrate the tendency to turn away from evaluative judgment in cases of "ignorance." 19 The kind of apparatus Bowers had in mind, as he made clear in his footnote 20, was one in which a list of emendations records all editorial alterations to the copy-text (accidentals as well as substantives) and a "historical collation" records only the substantive variants in the collated documents. In this system, the choice of copy-text does not affect the length of the tabulation of substantive variants (since all are recorded in one list or another), but it does change the length of the listing of accidentals unless the number of required emendations of copy-text accidentals happens to be the same in any case. Bowers recognizes, at least in the instance of a revised-edition copy-text, that the unlisted first-edition variants in accidentals are of legitimate interest to the reader; and the only explanation he offers for not noting them is that it is "usually impracticable to record in the Historical Collation all rejected accidentals as well as substantives." 20 He reports that in his edition of Tom Jones "proportionately far more indifferent variants are inserted from the revised edition into the first-edition copy-text than in the conservatively treated Joseph Andrews " (p. 159). 21 The year before, however, in Tales of Whilomville (1969), he postulated that the McClure's and Cornhill texts of "His New Mittens" radiated from Crane's manuscript. But the evidence here is not conclusive, as it is with the syndicated newspaper pieces. 22 See, for example, the discussion of "A Mystery of Heroism": the six newspaper texts "are technically of equal authority," but "For convenience the Philadelphia Press printing has been selected as copy-text, since it is representative. It is reprinted here, emended as necessary by reference to the other authorities when it appears to wander whether in accidentals or in substantives from the majority view" (p. lxix). In the case of "The Clan of No-Name," the conjectural textual history "places each of the preserved documents as technically equal in authority with the others in respect to the accidentals" (p. cxix); but the "usual moderate position" of the New York Herald "in respect to what may be reconstructed as the accidentals of the lost typescript makes it the most satisfactory and convenient copy-text" (p. cxxiii). 23 But not always: sometimes, he asserts, "only general concurrence of the following editions is in question and exactness of detail would serve no useful purpose." In those cases he introduces a plus/minus sign to signify that the majority of the newspaper texts (but not all of them) have the cited punctuation. He adds, "If it seemed important to indicate that certain of these variant texts had such and such punctuation, then the listing would do so as most convenient." (See 6: 335-336.) 24 In making this point (p. 466), he overstates the mechanical nature of the establishment of accidentals under Greg's rationale; as Bowers elsewhere recognizes (and as Greg himself does in the "Rationale"), copy-text accidentals, like the substantives, can be emended whenever one has a basis (necessarily involving critical judgment) for doing so. 25 In a footnote Bowers acknowledges, "Paradoxically, the copy-text most faithful to the reconstructed printer's-copy conceals more information in its list of emendations by recording fewer of the multiple variants than would be the case for a copy-text less faithful." His response to this problem is not satisfactory, however, because it concentrates on a "limited" recording of additional variants and does not admit the logical necessity of a full report: "How far this concealment of the evidence on which the work was edited can be rectified by including among the substantive variants of the Historical Collation the accidentals variants rejected from the other witnesses is a procedure sometimes practicable on a limited basis." An editor who pursues this idea can, Bowers believes, "start by omitting at least the unique variants—since these will have little or no claim to authority—and then progress up the scale so far as seems practicable." But this thinking is at odds with the important point made earlier that a critical approach to variants must take precedence over a merely statistical one. (In a later volume of the edition [volume 3 but published in 1976], The Third Violet and Active Service , Bowers specifically notes that "a minority, or even a single newspaper, may on some very few occasions reflect more faithfully the proof than the styled majority" [p. 332].) 26 See "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts," Library , 5th ser., 29 (1974), 330-337; reprinted in Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (1990), pp. 167-176 (and see my comment on p. xiii of the preface to this volume, suggesting that "the idea of editing without a copy-text, set forth briefly here in relation to one particular kind of situation, has further applications that ought to be explored"). Bowers commented on my 1974 article the following year in his "Remarks on Eclectic Texts" (see note 8 above); after saying that a copy-text selected from a group of radiating texts is "only a peg on which to hang the apparatus of variation," he refers to my "interesting proposal," which—though it seems "logically planned"—he has not "had the opportunity to test" (p. 507, footnote 26). In his 1978 essay on Greg, he repeats the idea that for radiating texts the "choice of copy-text rests on the convenience of the reader according to the ease with which he can refer to the apparatus"; then he adds, "On the other hand, if an editor chooses to adopt G. T. Tanselle's ingenious suggestions for a new kind of apparatus for radiating texts, the need for an arbitrary copy-text vanishes" (p. 149, footnote 48). (In the same footnote, Bowers suggests, without realizing it, a way in which the editorial thinking involved in a radiating-text situation could be extended to any instance of variant texts: when a statistical survey of variants determines the choice of a radiating copy-text, he says, "there should be little if any need for an editor to rely on any accidental in the copy-text simply because it occurs in the copy-text, although he may of course take that fact into account when the copy-text document seems on the whole to be relatively faithful and all other evidence is indifferent.") For a similar discussion of apparatus for radiating texts nine years later, see p. 76 of Bowers's "Mixed Texts and Multiple Authority," Text , 3 (1987), 63-90. 27 In "Mixed Texts and Multiple Authority" (see the preceding note), he includes in a footnote the explicit statement, "It is quite improper to use it [ copy-text ] as a synonym for printer's copy in general" (p. 87). For a more detailed account of this distinction, see my "The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note," SB , 23 (1970), 191-196. When I submitted this piece—which is a rejoinder to Paul Baender's "The Meaning of Copy-Text" in the previous volume of SB (22 [1969], 311-318)—Bowers said that he had planned (before my piece came in) to write such a response himself. 28 Leonard E. Boyle calls modern editors "scribe-scholars" in "'Epistulae Venerunt Parum Dulces': The Place of Codicology in the Editing of Medieval Latin Texts," in Editing and Editors: A Retrospect , ed. Richard Landon (1988), pp. 29-46 (see p. 30). (This essay also provides a useful statement of the value of examining the physical "setting" in which a text has been transmitted; the examples are drawn from the study of early manuscripts, but the points made are equally applicable to the study of printed books—and have of course been made many times by analytical bibliographers.) 29 The inhibiting influence of a copy-text resembles the pressure that can also be exerted by a previous scholarly edition: Leonard Boyle has said, "the greatest threat to an editor's independence and to an unprejudiced presentation of a textual tradition is the presence of an existing edition." See "'Epistulae Venerunt Parum Dulces'" (cited in the preceding note), p. 31. 30 Bowers makes the same point, though somewhat more moderately, in "Remarks on Eclectic Texts" (see note 8 above), pp. 522-524. 31 "Unfinished Business," Bowers's presidential address to the Society for Textual Scholarship, printed in Text , 4 (1988), 1-11 (quotations from p. 5).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">One of the great mathematicians of this century, j. e. Littlewood, wrote of his ancient Greek predecessors that they were to be thought of not as promising schoolboys or "scholarship candidates," but as "fellows of another college," who used a somewhat different vocabulary. 1 His remark suggests a potentially fruitful way of looking at the history of any intellectual discipline: when, within its course, do we find practitioners who are, essentially, our equals?—who, if they were resurrected, we feel we should be in more or less immediate communication with? Consider textual and historical criticism. Although an intelligent concern for the authenticity of written texts can be found even in the pre-Christian era, it seems to me that full "colleagues" in Littlewood's sense can scarcely be found earlier than in the seventeenth century, when they certainly did exist—witness Jean Mabillon and Richard Bentley; or perhaps, for textual criticism, in the sixteenth century in the shape of such scholars as Scaliger or Lambinus; or just possibly in the fifteenth century, with Angelo Poliziano and Lorenzo Valla. This is not, of course, to suggest that minds were less intelligent before these times, only that it becomes increasingly difficult to find true commonality of concerns. Indeed, textual critics today find commonality with the figures just mentioned in large measure because it is the latter who, primarily, shaped the methodology of the discipline. Who are the corresponding figures, and what the consequent age, of the related discipline of (analytical) bibliography—by which word I mean the reasoned study of printed books as artefacts? 2 To adhere to an argument already made, I should say that the time span back to our earliest bibliographical "colleagues"—predecessors whose thinking we treat as fully equal to the best of our own day—is considerably shorter. I see Henry Bradshaw (1831-1886) as the first and perhaps greatest of our colleagues. 3 By this very rigorous standard, analytical bibliography would be less than 150 years old. And yet of course, those 150 years of bibliography still have a complex history which is not a self-evident one: it must be studied with the tools of scholarship. The tribe of bibliographers is not a particularly numerous one. It would be curious to attempt to list all those who have contributed significantly to the bibliography of books printed in European languages: how many names, one wonders, would result? Within that group, the number who have contributed in the most fundamental and long-lasting way, by introducing new concepts and categories of bibliographical investigation, is evidently very small. That honor can belong only to a relative handful. And yet, it is surely true to say that however short the list were made, Allan Stevenson's name would be on it. Stevenson's contribution can be summarized in a single sentence: he codified the scholarly study of paper as bibliographical evidence. If we place that contribution alongside the contributions of Henry Bradshaw, who similarly codified the study of codex structure, and of typography, it becomes evident that an extraordinary proportion of all our various strategies for studying books derives ultimately, in fact, from the thinking, and relatively few publications, of these two men. The following pages are focused almost exclusively on Stevenson's bibliographical publications, rather than on his character, his career, or his life in general. My concern is to examine in some detail the development of Stevenson's thinking about paper evidence as it emerges from his published writings; and, to a degree, what reception his thoughts found among fellow book students. But it must be acknowledged, however little one explores the issue, that there is an unusually stark contrast between Stevenson's importance to the thinking of the bibliographical world, and his relative lack of success within the academic community. Allan Henry Stevenson was born 20 June 1903 in Merlin, Ontario. His family moved in his youth to Texas, where he graduated in 1924 from the Rice Institute, Houston, earning an M.A. there two years later. After several years of teaching at Rice, Stevenson moved to the University of Chicago to begin doctoral studies in English literature. This became a long-drawn-out process: it was twenty years before Stevenson was awarded his doctorate in 1949, at the age of 46. During these years he worked variously as instructor and assistant professor in English at De Paul University, the University of Chicago, and Illinois Institute of Technology. He never rose above assistant professor, and his teaching career ended ingloriously in 1952, tenure-less and untethered. The remainder of Stevenson's life was spent essentially as free-lance scholar, moving from one fellowship, study grant, or temporary appointment to another. His longest uninterrupted stint was of five years, devoted to cataloguing the botanical library of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt, in Pittsburgh. I strongly suspect that the successful career in radio and television production of Stevenson's wife Rachel Waples (the dedicatee KIM of The Problem of the Missale Speciale ) supplied his most reliable fellowship. The topic of Stevenson's dissertation was the Anglo-Irish playwright James Shirley, and he published in the 1940s a few miscellaneous articles spun off from this work, relating to Shirley's years in Ireland and to his involvement with the first Dublin theater and with the London publishers William Crooke and Andrew Cooke. Stevenson's first purely bibliographical publication appeared in late 1948 in the inaugural volume of Fredson Bowers's annual, Studies in Bibliography (then titled Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia ): "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence." Stevenson's chief concern here was to chart the printing and forme-correction history of one quarto play, Shirley's The Opportunitie (1640). He merged his notes on the sheet-by-sheet changes of paper stock of a sample of a dozen copies with other bibliographical data such as identification of skeleton headlines. There is nothing in "New Uses" to suggest any specific inspiration or mentor for this unusual concentration on paper stocks as evidence. Stevenson's involvement with paper must, however, have been gestating for some years, for a hint of it appears in his first scholarly article. 4 The results of Stevenson's calculations as to such questions as edition size, order of printing, chronology, and whether the inner forme or the outer was printed first, are perhaps not entirely successful or convincing. For instance, he found reason to suppose, from the ratios of paper-stock distribution in his sample, that 1,500 copies of The Opportunitie were printed. Thus, where sheet B of his sample showed 6 examples of IHS-marked paper and six of Pot, he assumed that this represented three tokens (half-reams) of each stock, or 750 copies of each. If we grant the premiss, his conclusion follows that "Sheet E is easy: exactly two tokens of IHS and one of bird (8:4); and so is F, with five tokens of IHS and one of bird (10:2)" ("New Uses," p. 159). But should we grant the premiss? Surely this is false exactitude. The neatness of Stevenson's numbers is primarily owing to the fact that his sample of copies (12) is a convenient factor of the hypothesized print run (1,500), the result being 125—a quarter-ream or half-token. If the sample had been, say, 13 copies, one could not have come up with such seemingly exact extrapolations; and yet the body of evidence would have been enlarged! With so small a sample—less than 1% of the copies (hypothetically) printed—it is entirely possible that the record of paper stocks appearing in a given edition sheet (for which term see below) will not correspond precisely, perhaps not even closely, to the ratio of paper stocks originally used. In fact, it is distinctly more likely that a series of small per-sheet samples will vary somewhat from the original proportions of paper stocks for their edition sheets, than that they will correspond exactly to the original proportions. 5 A substantial portion of "New Uses," in which Stevenson attempted to use shifts of skeletons (including headlines) to determine order of printing of formes, has a certain whiff of the '40s to it. This was, so to speak, one of the standard ten-finger exercises for well-tempered bibliographers of the time, following the model of Charlton Hinman's and Fredson Bowers's earlier studies of headline evidence. 6 There was little awareness of the far preferable direct test for order of printing of formes: of the two formes of a sheet, which pushes into the other, and hence comes second? Lest one suppose, by the way, that the test was not "discovered" until some years later by Kenneth Povey, it may be pointed out that German incunabulists had been using this diagnostic, since the turn of the century, to distinguish books printed page-by-page from those printed over multiple-page formes. 7 In general, critically viewed, "New Uses" was not quite so pathbreaking a study as its title may immediately suggest. In its arguments for edition size of The Opportunitie , in its discussion of forme sequence, and elsewhere, it is a good standard example of the over-rationalization of assumed printing shop procedures that D. F. McKenzie warned against two decades later. 8 Sufficient evidence and warning of the tendency may be found in such of Stevenson's rhetorical formulations as: "We may suppose that [the printer] Cotes's well-ordered establishment . . ." ("New Uses," p. 166); or ". . . as will be seen presently, sheet C must have been printed around Easter; and on the morning of Easter Even or Easter Monday Tom Cotes or the corrector might come to the printing-house late. Now then . . ." (p. 168). The specific reasoning that follows hardly matters; one knows that it passes the bounds of the evidence. On the other hand, an apparently solid if minor result of Stevenson's research seems to have been overlooked. Shirley's Opportunitie is one of a closely related group of seven play quartos (two by Fletcher, the remainder by Shirley) printed by Thomas Cotes, two of which bear title-page dates of 1639, the remainder of 1640. Stevenson gives good evidence that all seven, sharing a set of small job lots of paper, were printed in the winter to early spring of 1640. The two "1639" title-pages most probably reflect Old Style convention, with year change on Lady Day 25 March, and are to be interpreted as 1640. 9 This argument has gone unnoticed both by Sir Walter Greg's Corrections to his Bibliography of the English Printed Drama , and by the Revised STC , where the two plays in question remain assigned to 1639. 10 Perhaps even more minor, but bibliographically very pretty, is Stevenson's correlation of the paper stocks with the corrections in sheet C of The Opportunitie , where uncorrected and corrected states may be identified of both the outer (o) and inner (i) formes. He found the following pattern: uncorrected o—i: Pot (3x) corrected o, uncorrected i: Pot (3x) (uncorrected o, corrected i): none corrected o—i: Bird (3x), IHS (3x) Here we seem almost to be handed a "retroscope," giving a momentary glimpse (if still a cloudy one) into the work patterns of a 1640 printing shop. Essentially, this first appearance of Stevenson as a critical or analytical bibliographer reveals a strong general interest in and knowledge of paper, and an effective vocabulary for describing watermarks and paper stocks. Possibly, too, it is the first study to introduce the very useful concept of the "edition sheet" ("New Uses," p. 154)—all the copies printed of a particular sheet of a book. But judged by solidity of result, this still looks very much like the prentice effort of a somewhat aged (45-year-old) apprentice. It stands out only because the study of paper was an area where almost no one else in the bibliographical community (the most notable exception would have been Allen Hazen in his study of the authentic and forged Strawberry Hill books) was even at that rudimentary stage. 11 There is a significant and tantalizing "delayed opportunity" in the 1948 article. Stevenson wrote in passing ("New Uses," p. 156 note 15), "such [paper] trays were commonly made and used in matched pairs, so that one ordinarily cannot tell their watermarks apart." Here is an instance where a false statement, clearly and energetically phrased, can serve as a springboard to the truth. All that was needed was for that single word "cannot"—twin watermarks cannot be told apart—to change to a "can." For twins can be told apart, and that is the key to all adequate studies of handmade, watermarked paper. In 1948 Stevenson was on the verge of his great discovery; his mind was fully prepared to take interest in the question; but the time was not quite ripe. There is, of course, no trace of discredit in Stevenson's initial failure to recognize that twin trays—moulds—with twin marks can be distinguished, and that there is a point to distinguishing them. The group of papers he was studying most intently are found in play quartos, hence with marks divided in the gutter, often in copies that would have been tightly bound; and he was dealing with very frequent changes of paper stocks, rather than long runs. It would have been difficult indeed to get pictures of these marks sufficiently accurate that the small details separating one twin from another could be grasped. Stevenson's "Watermarks are Twins", appearing three years later, marks what is—or at least could have been—a new era in bibliographical study. For the first time, scholars were provided with a coherent conceptual structure for describing and analysing stocks of mould-made paper—a structure comparable with (and in fact closely related to) what Henry Bradshaw had provided, in association with William Blades and G. F. Tupper, a century earlier for handmade types. Paper stocks, Stevenson showed, were to be uniquely defined as products of the twin moulds that produced them—the result of the centuries-old paper mill tempo whereby a vat man and a coucher worked in tandem, interchanging in rotation two separate moulds sharing a single deckle. All complications of specific examples (and there are many such complications) flow in an orderly way from this underlying pattern. Equally new and important in this study was Stevenson's careful description and illustrated documentation of the changing states that moulds and wiremarks characteristically undergo in the course of their use. Never before had watermarks been examined so closely. Stevenson's article did not draw a single, striking conclusion from his new rationale for defining and studying paper. In essence, he provided bibliographers with a powerful new weapon for attacking any—that is, potentially any—problem involving documents printed (or drawn, or written) on handmade European paper. For those who have absorbed the lesson of twinship in handmade European paper—who have built on Stevenson's foundations—it is at first a little surprising to realize how unsettled Stevenson's vocabulary was in 1954 for distinguishing twins, and how unclear, at several points, were his underlying concepts. Until this time, virtually all studies of paper were based simply on traced or free-drawn—very occasionally photographed—images of the watermark itself. In essence, they were free-floating images. The best of the watermark albums, Briquet's, did indeed show also the positions of the chainlines adjacent to the marks, but this was still not sufficient to localize the mark, with unambiguous orientation, on its mould. It was assumed (unless otherwise stated, for other placements are possible), that the mark was centered in either the right or left half of its mould. I am not aware of any study which made a point of defining this situation further: which argued that there was any reason to distinguish which half of its mould a mark was centered in, or to take note of which side of the sheet one was examining. When twin marks are to be identified, a more precise set of concepts and corresponding vocabulary become indispensable. In principle, with only the rarest of exceptions, twin marks are meant to look like each other. The idea, if we can call it that, must have been that to the casual but experienced eye—say, that of the paper maker, who had to keep track of his mould-pairs, or identify his own stocks—the twin marks sitting on a mould or in the sheets of a ream should look enough alike that it would be obvious that they belong together. 12 Thus, if twin marks are to be distinguished for subsequent scholarly purposes, one must find consistent ways to describe their differences. To see how Stevenson, the first scholar to make this attempt, formed his concepts, it may be useful for comparison to outline my own descriptive system. It is not, of course, the only possible system, nor necessarily the best. But it has the virtue of being the direct descendant of Stevenson's system, and so is in communication with that system. A sheet of handmade paper is a reflection of a paper mould in much the same way as a printed page is a reflection of the printing surface. The sheet has, of course, two sides: the mould side, which was actually in contact with the wire mesh of the paper mould; and the felt side, as it may conveniently be called, the side which was first laid onto the felt as the sheet was pressed out of the mould. If one examines a sheet with mould side facing, one sees in essence a mirror image of the upper surface of the mould; if one looks at the felt side, one sees in essence the upper surface of the mould itself. Similarly, if one looks at a printed page, one sees a reflection of the printing surface (type-page); if one looks through the page from the other side of the leaf, one sees in essence the raised surfaces of the type-page itself. The mould, with wiremark sewn on, has a more or less indefinite number of individualizing features, and the question of which of these one records from its "mirror," the sheet, is to some extent arbitrary. One wants the most generally compendious, consistent, and useful details, but these will not, of course, be the necessary details for every conceivable investigation. Again, the analogy with founts of types and their descriptions is more or less obvious. Examples of data one might record are: sheet size, number of chainlines, placement of tranchefiles (supplementary chains placed adjacent to the two shorter sides of the mould), number or "density" of wirelines, apparent thickness of chainlines and wirelines, placement of the wiremark, various dimensions of the wiremark (greatest height and breadth, etc.), irregularities of the chainlines and wirelines, etc. Because a stock is built from twin moulds, one must make double records for each stock, one set for each mould. Besides these records, one needs of course pictures of the watermarks, which might be freehand drawings, tracings, photographs or radiographs, or (only "discovered" after Stevenson's death) rubbings. Even these pictures, however accurate, are only a poor substitute for the ideal: an actual-size image of the entire sheet. A record for a single paperstock (one of those supplying the Gutenberg Bible) could look like this: 13 Royal: Bull's Head a. mR4 | 19 | 14 chains (ave. 42.1 mm) | 18 | (6+) b. mL4 (3+) | 21 | 14 chains (ave. 42.3 mm) | 18 | (1+) Such a record gives the sheet size (Royal), the watermark type (Bull's Head), and a rough description of the sheets turned out from each mould, a. and b. The a-sheets have watermarks located in the right (R) half, in the fourth chain-space in from the edge. 14 Looked at from the mould side, these have a left tranchefile space of 19 mm, then 14 chainlines with an average spacing of 42.1 mm, then a right tranchefile space of 18 mm, then a distance to the deckle edge of more than 6 mm. In any number of ways the information could be expanded, but several rationales underlie the information given and the way it is given: (1) Sheet size: The full dimensions of a sheet are not easily determined in most printed books, because edges are typically shaved or trimmed. The identification of its named size, Royal, at least gives an idea of the original measure, say 42 x 60 cm. Even if one has deckle edge at top and bottom of a sheet, the measurement will of course vary from place to place, deckle being in its nature irregular. It is not obvious, therefore, that there would be any useful meaning in giving a highly precise measurement, such as 42.73 cm, between two particular top and bottom points. As to the breadth of the sheet, the across-the-sheet record of tranchefiles and chainlines shows that the breadth must be at least 59 cm. Here too, an honest approximation seems at least equally as useful as looking for an unusually tall and broad copy of the Gutenberg Bible, searching out (if one exists) a sheet with deckle at both edges, and then trying to sum the breadth of the conjugate leaves, not forgetting the portion that may be more or less lost in the fold. (2) Chainline count: This is, indeed, a very crude "measurement," but a useful one in its unambiguity: paper from twin moulds of, say, 14 chains cannot be the same as paper from moulds of 13 chains, however similar their watermarks. Extrapolation from the average spacing between chainlines is almost always a sufficient clue to enable one to calculate with high certainty whether a chainline is hidden in the gutter of a folio, or lost due to trimming in a quarto book or smaller. But there may well be instances, particularly when dealing with unwatermarked paper, when considerably more detailed data on chainlines and wirelines will be useful. 15 (3) Mould side: If one is to stay properly oriented while visualizing sheets and their watermarks, it is certainly good to describe paper consistently as seen either from the mould or the felt side. I have myself always tried to describe watermark placements as seen from the mould side, but there are instances where felt-side reproductions make sense: when lettering associated with the mark has right reading from the felt side. In such cases, it is perverse to reproduce mirror writing, but the relevant figure of a mark can be captioned "(f.s.)," viz. as seen from the felt side. 16 (4) Watermark placement: Such a formula as "mR3"—mark in the right half of the (mouldside) sheet, third chain-space in (from the nearest short edge)—is only a very approximate location. In principle, one might give further detail, such as distance in from the deckle edge, or height of the mark above the lower edge. The chief obstacle is that, as already noted, it is rare to find absolutely untrimmed sheets in printed books, supplying reference points from which to measure. It should also be noted that the concepts of mR (mark centered in the right) and mL depend on the watermark figure having an identifiable upright position. In most cases—Shields, Letters, Animals, etc.—this is self-evident. In fewer cases, one must set an arbitrary standard: is an Anchor upright when its eye is on top, or its arm? The only right answer is a consistent one. And in a few cases—Cross in circle, or Rosette—there is no "up," and without that orientation, mR and mL become meaningless. Where marks are not symmetrical on a vertical axis, it is often convenient to add a siglum of "handedness." For example, a single-handled Pot could be defined as mRhR3 (handle to right) or mRhL3 (handle to left). With these introductory comments to provide a standard of comparison, we can judge Stevenson's first remarks on identifying twin watermarks. He listed a variety of differentia by which twin marks can be told apart, such as variation in how they are sewn with respect to their neighboring chains, in their slant, in position of sewing dots, and in other significant detail. He outlined a system of measuring position of parts of the watermark with respect to adjacent chainlines: ". . . the crescent or fleuron in the superstructure of a pot may measure :3[13]5: or, more simply, 3[13]5—which means that the part is 13 mm. wide, centered between chains 21 mm. apart, 3 mm. from its outer chain and 5 from its inner chain . . ." ("Watermarks are Twins" p. 69). Such measurements formed a major part of Stevenson's private notes on paper, but the information they convey is so inferior to that supplied by actual-size representations of watermarks that I have difficulty in seeing them as a fundamental element of paperstock description. 17 But Stevenson's first point, "Difference of Mould-end," is in fact unclear: he seems to have mixed up two independent forms of variation. He first stated, correctly, that twins are often centered in different halves of their moulds (i.e., one is mL and one mR). But as evidence for this, he stated (p. 66) "Actually, this is mainly an inference from the fact that some marks read in and some read out ." That is, when marks bear letters, and are so oriented that their lettering reads forward, the lettering may either read "in" toward the center of the sheet, or "out" from the center. However, this distinction does not in fact reveal whether the mark is mR or mL. If the lettered mark reads "in," it is mL if one is looking at the mould side, and mR if one is looking at the felt side. In short, this is not direct evidence for which end of a paper mould contains the wiremark. The primary evidence is rather what Stevenson here considered secondary: "Frequently the inference may be checked by the indentations made by the watermark or chain wires." The first step in "orienting" a watermark is to identify, from indentations, the mould side. Any mark, if it has an obvious or definable "up," can then be classed, when seen from the mould side, as mR or mL. 18 It makes no difference whether its lettering, seen from that side, reads forward or in reverse. Consider a stock marked with the Arms of England above a label with the maker's name JONES. The twins of such a stock can be any combination of mR or mL, and forward-lettered or reverse-lettered: four possibilities in all for each. At this stage, Stevenson was still shaping his concepts and his vocabulary. He had no descriptive model to draw on, and it is not surprising if his reasoning was still in part inexact. A like confusion seems to have led Stevenson astray in discussing the twins of the stock used in the 1619 Pavier quarto The Whole Contention between York and Lancaster . This stock is marked with a single-handed Pot with initials PA. Stevenson identified the twins, but his description (p. 80) is cryptic: ". . . in Pot a the letters consistently read up , and in b as consistently down ." Very few readers, one suspects, could have visualized the situation here. What Stevenson apparently meant is that for one twin, the initials PA read forward from the mould-side ("up" meaning mould-side up), and for the other they read forward from the felt-side (mould-side "down"). Stevenson knew the distinction between mould-side and felt-side, but did not yet have the habit of referring to them clearly or the vocabulary for doing so. From Stevenson's description, one still has no way of knowing whether one twin was mR and one mL, both mR, or both mL. Similar confusions arise in Stevenson's descriptions of several other Pot marks. Concerning a Pot stock with initials G / RO on its bowl he writes (p. 84), ". . . one mark reads up away from the handle, and the other also up towards the handle; so that both appear in the left halfsheet." The conclusion does not follow. If we specify a single-handle Pot with initials as being possibly (a) mR [in right half of sheet] or mL [in left half], (b) with hR [handle to right] or hL [handle to left], and (c) with lettering from mouldside reading forward ("up") or reversed ("down"), there are eight possible arrangements. There are two ways for a mark to read "up away from the handle," of which one way is mR (fig.6) and one mL (fig.2); and two ways to read "up towards the handle," of which again one way is mR (fig.5) and one mL (fig.1). An unambiguous way to distinguish these is by some such nomenclature as mRhL (G / RO), mRhR (G / RO reversed), etc. Stevenson devoted almost no space in "Watermarks are Twins" to the question of why it is bibliographically useful "to know that watermarks like wrens go in pairs" (p. 88). He did note, however, that a recognition of the "binary nature" of watermarks would have strengthened Greg's famous demonstration that the eight or nine Shakespearean quartos published by Thomas Pavier with various dates 1600, 1608, and 1619 were all actually produced in 1619. Greg's studies on the Pavier quartos had considerable importance for Stevenson, being, although nearly a half-century old, still the most striking exemplification within the Anglo-American bibliographical world of what Stevenson had yet to prove from his own work: that the analysis of watermarks could lead to important results. 19 This group of quartos first became a "problem" in 1906, when A. W. Pollard took note of two separate volumes, each containing all nine editions bound together. When looked at together (most copies having been disbound in the past and treated as independent units), a family resemblance seemed to emerge. Eight of the nine contain the same titlepage device, with Welsh motto Heb Ddieu Heb Ddim , and none of the imprints give publishers' addresses. 20 How did these similarities in layout maintain themselves over so long a span of time, and how were at least several copies of all nine apparently sold together? Pollard tentatively supposed that a substantial number of sheets of the five "1600" and "1608" editions remained unsold until 1619, when Thomas Pavier marketed them with four newly-printed editions as a kind of Shakespeare set. Greg exposed the weakness of this explanation—which Pollard happily relinquished—by studying the watermarks of the editions, and discovering that of some 27 separate marks, mostly Pots, a number seemed to be shared between editions variously dated 1600, 1608, and 1619. He concluded that this went beyond what the invocation of coincidence could support. All the editions must have been produced in 1619, by William Jaggard (possessor at that time of the Heb Ddieu Heb Ddim device). The earlier dates and several of their imprints ("by James Roberts 1600"; "for Nathaniel Butter 1608") were intentionally deceiving. Greg's arguments received independent confirmation two years later when an American scholar, W. J. Neidig, showed additionally that most of the title-pages of the Pavier quartos share standing type. 21 Under an awareness of twinship, the situation obviously changes markedly, though Greg's argument from paper retains all its strength. Greg recorded 27 "different" marks, mostly Pots, in four sets of the quartos: thus four copies each of 81½ edition sheets, or about 310 watermarks (subtracting unwatermarked sheets). Simple probability suggests that within these parameters various consequences become highly likely. First: some of the recorded marks will surely pair off as twins; the number of stocks represented by the drawings must be less than 27. Second: there will very probably be twin marks either that did not turn up in this relatively small sample, or that Greg overlooked because their differentia are inconspicuous. Third: there could well be fugitive stocks that do not happen to show up in these four copies. After all, nine of the watermarks recorded by Greg appear in his sample in three or fewer examples each. Stevenson was able to demonstrate at least the first and third of these predictions satisfactorily, and the second is fairly evident. 22 In "Watermarks are Twins" (p. 80) Stevenson "assembled" several stocks from Greg's drawings, e.g. Greg 2 + 5 are a single stock, Greg 15 + 16 another. In a supplementary note, "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks" (1952), Stevenson identified two "new" Pot stocks in the Pavier quartos, both rare and both in rather battered state, of which one Pot has a bowl bearing the damaged date 1608 (probably), and the other the date 1617 (probably). Since these appear in copies of Sir John Oldcastle "1600" and Henry V "1608" respectively, Greg's argument for the falsity of the title-page dates is corroborated. The exemplary status of Greg's "False Dates" for establishing the bibliographical value of paper evidence was emphasized by Stevenson in various subsequent writings, and Greg seems increasingly to have advanced, in Stevenson's mind, as his bibliographical master. Greg's introductory words from "False Dates," "a happy inspiration led me to examine the paper," provided an epigraph for The Problem of the Missale Speciale . 23 By an odd chance, in the same year that Stevenson announced paper-mould twinship to the English speaking book world, A. W. Kazmeier of the Gutenberg-Museum, Mainz, made a similar announcement to the German book world, with regard to the paper stocks of the Gutenberg Bible. 24 Kazmeier made very accurate tracings of the watermarks in the copy of the Gutenberg Bible (volume II only), acquired in 1925 by the Gutenberg-Museum from Count Solms. He organized his tracings into twin marks representing four different Bull's Head stocks, two Grape stocks, and two Ox stocks. This was a major step forward in understanding the Bible's paper supply, building on the researches of Paul Schwenke, who had recorded the paper distribution of 27 copies, but whose cruder drawings had revealed only one Bull's Head stock. 25 The central virtue of Kazmeier's study was his clear recognition that each of the stocks is represented by twin marks. More consistently than Stevenson, he reproduced and discussed the marks according to whether, from the mouldside, they were centered in the right or left half of the sheet. Kazmeier did make an error in his treatment of the Ox stock, through a failure to realize that one of his tracings is a mirrored duplicate of another. He unwittingly took one tracing of an Ox from the felt side, and another of the same Ox as seen from the mould side, and on this basis created a "ghost" second Ox stock. 26 What, finally, is the significance of twinship? Stevenson did not "discover" the twinship of moulds. Hand papermakers had always known, and continued to know, about twins. Twin moulds are listed in scattered business records of paper mills, and their use is described in various eighteenth-century accounts of papermaking. The great historian of paper Charles-Moïse Briquet wrote with precision of twin moulds, and reproduced several examples of twin marks. Even in Greg's classic study of "False Dates" there is clear reference to twinship, derived from Briquet, and yet Greg manifestly failed to see its application: ". . . technical evidence goes to show that a pair of frames could perhaps be made to last two years . . ." (p. 121). It was Stevenson's achievement to see that twinship had a methodological point: a paper stock is only defined when both its twins can be identified. Once stated, the point surely becomes self-evident. For in the absence of identified twins, one might easily (for example) record one watermark in one book, and a second similar but nonidentical mark in another, with no way of judging whether one was dealing with the same or two different stocks. During the following years, Stevenson's greatest energies were particularly applied to cataloguing Mrs. Hunt's important botanical library in Pittsburgh. His scholarly publications, late-begun and never numerous, seem to lack a clear developing shape during the eight or so years after "Watermarks are Twins." It should be remembered, however, that Stevenson's methodological statements on paper evidence were supported by a deep historical interest in all aspects of European papermaking and paper supply, based on widest reading in the published literature as well as a great quantity of original research. This profound groundwork makes itself felt in many peripheral remarks in "New Uses" and "Watermarks are Twins," but is especially evident in Stevenson's "Critical Study" of Heawood's watermark album (1951), in his review of The Briquet Album (1955), and in his lengthy introduction to Briquet's Opuscula (1955). 27 The broad-based but precise knowledge of handmade paper these studies reveal was then unique at least in the English-speaking world, and it may be doubted whether anyone of the present day can equal it. Throughout these years, and after, Stevenson projected an historical monograph which never eventuated, studying the paper supply of English printers in the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. Its name and scope varied, from "Notes on Norman Papermakers" to Norman Paper and English Books to The Unicorns of Normandy . 28 One further purely methodological study appeared in the early 1950s, "Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence" (1953-1954). Stevenson emphasized here, more forcefully than in "Watermarks are Twins," the importance of distinguishing the two sides of paper sheets. He did not yet possess, however, a consistent terminology. We find the expression "mould side" alongside the synonyms "right side" and "wire side." The term "felt side" does not appear, though its rather confusing trade synonym "wrong side" does. But Stevenson did not settle on any of these. One finds him using instead a variety of locutions: "sequence of grooves" and "groove pattern"; "indentations," "indented side," and "unindented side"; "smooth side" and "rough side." Concepts need words, and the absence of a stable pair of expressions for the two sheet sides may be partly responsible for another "orientation error" in Stevenson's discussion: "As always, paper was made on a pair of moulds, and these moulds varied in the position of the main mark—some pairs having their marks in opposite halves, some having them on the same side with one reversed or even inverted" (p. 183). This is illogical. As noted above, the position of a watermark in right or left (mould-side) half of a sheet is premissed on the mark being identifiably upright in one position. If one finds twin marks in two sheets of paper, of which one mark is upright in the right half of the sheet (mR), and the other inverted in the right half, that is equivalent to saying that the latter is mL. Therefore, "marks in opposite halves" represents the identical situation as "on the same side . . . with one . . . inverted." As to the point of distinguishing sheet sides, Stevenson put most emphasis on the identification of cancels. Cancels may reveal themselves by bearing unorthodox or unexpected signatures, by typographic differences, etc. But the test of mould-side conjugacy (as I should call it) may signal the presence of cancel or supplied leaves even where other clues are lacking. In the general case, an established format for a printed book implies that all the leaves, or specified leaves, of a quire will form parts of the same sheet. This in turn entails that these leaves stand in orderly relation to each other with respect to conjugacies across the sewing fold and (in smaller than folio formats) over the top edge; to mould-side sequences; to watermark positions; and to location of tranchefiles and other indicators of sheet edges. Any disturbance to the required pattern must indicate a cancel or supplied leaf. 29 The eighteenth-century volume of the Hunt Botanical Catalogue (1961) displays to advantage Stevenson's considerable general skills as a descriptive bibliographer, and his wide-ranging knowledge of European papers. Each copy description includes an expert note on the papers used, with distinction where necessary between the plate paper and the letter-press paper, in the form: "Demy, Genoese, marked FBcorner G and corner flower" (the long dividing marks from counter- and corner-marks). These are, indeed, intended as no more than preliminary notes, with identifications of size, source (papermaker or region of manufacture,) and watermarks. But the notes mark an advance, I believe, with respect to consistency and authority, over what may be found in any earlier bibliography or catalogue, and continue to supply a useful descriptive model for catalogues which do not take the additional step of reproducing watermarks. The two most significant methodological points of the Hunt Botanical Catalogue with respect to paper are the interrelated treatments of format and of paper sizes. The book-student interested in paper as a material object can hardly avoid being more sensitive to issues of format than the student for whom the leaves are merely a neutral whitish substance bearing the inked text. An accurate statement of format depends on identifying the fractional relation between the leaf and the sheet, which can hardly be done without a strong mental image of what a sheet is. Stevenson's bibliographical introduction to the Hunt Botanical Catalogue properly pointed out (p. cliv) the persistent error of many catalogues in misnaming as folios what are actually gatherings of broadsheets: The only book-format which may be new to some readers is Broadsheet (or Broadside), which I abbreviate as 'Brs'. This means that the book is made up of single full sheets of paper, printed down the length of the sheet (usually), and bound along one long edge by stabbing or oversewing. It is a not uncommon format among eighteenth-and nineteenth-century books with colorplates; yet Brunet, Pritzel, Nissen, and even the Abbey catalogues confuse it with Folio. . . . There are, however, additional complications with books constructed of assemblages of single leaves, in handling of which Stevenson's descriptions in the Hunt Botanical Catalogue are somewhat less sure-footed. The single leaves of such books may not necessarily be full sheets of paper, but rather half-sheets (or some smaller fraction); or, they may be a combination of, say, half-sheets of one paper size and broadsheets of paper of half that size. In these cases, Stevenson used such format descriptions as "F° in is" and "mainly F° in halfsheets". 30 A number of otherwise highly sophisticated catalogues and bibliographies continue to be misleading or inconsistent in their treatment of broadsheet/broadside books and of single-leaf broadsides. 31 As to paper sizes: in his identifications of sizes in the Hunt catalogue, Stevenson was in essence contributing solidly to the post-war Anglo-American tradition already in progress—seemingly inaugurated by Philip Gaskell, The First Editions of William Mason (1951)—of designating paper sizes for eighteenth-century printing. The habit has still not established itself in bibliographical work on other centuries, although it is just starting to make its way in incunable descriptions. For the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in particular, we continue to lack reliable guides to paper sizes and nomenclatures, such as Gaskell and Stevenson have supplied for the eighteenth century. 32 An interest in paper sizes emerges at many scattered points in Stevenson's writings, but the process of synthesizing his data into a coherent picture moved slowly and apparently never coalesced into a full published statement. This was one of the chief topics planned for one chapter of his never-completed monograph, The Unicorns of Normandy . The central document for paper sizes in Stevenson's "original" century, the seventeenth, is the anonymous 1674-dated memorandum on prices of paper that was prepared for Bishop Fell. 33 It is instructive to note that Stevenson's first published use of the Oxford Price-List led him into venial error. In "New Uses" (p. 156) Stevenson referred to his study piece, James Shirley, The Opportunitie , 1640, as a "Demy" quarto, based on its leaf size as compared with the various measures of named sheet sizes in the Oxford Price-List. But this is an excellent lesson in the pitfalls inherent in treating documents as purveyors of pure, unmediated truth. The Oxford Price-List designates, for each stock available, its size name (and sometimes quality), a description of its watermark (and countermark if any), a statement of how many sheets are in its quires, its dimensions in the form "How many inches Long" and "How many inches Broad," and the per-ream price. However, "Long" and "Broad" must be interpreted. It is clear on examination that these figures represent not full sheets, but the height and breadth of the quire, each quire consisting of 24 or 25 folded sheets; the breadth must be doubled to get the full sheet size. With this correction, it becomes instantly apparent that the untrimmed leaf size of Shirley's Opportunitie conforms to Pott rather than Demy sheets. It would, indeed, have been a rare Elizabethan or Jacobean play quarto that was not printed on Pott-size sheets. By 1951, it is implicitly evident that Stevenson had caught his own error, 34 and he corrected it explicitly in "Watermarks are Twins" (p. 85), in his 1954 review of Labarre, and at some length in his 1955 essay, "Briquet and the Future of Paper Studies." 35 One particular encounter with paper in 1954 resulted, eventually, in Stevenson's major scholarly achievement. In September 1953 (announced in early 1954) the Pierpont Morgan Library acquired from H. P. Kraus a copy of the famous Constance Missal or Missale speciale , the first (and only) copy to reach America. The Library's publicity suggested that this undated, unsigned book, printed in a variant version of the smaller of the two founts used in the 1457 Mainz Psalter, was to be seen as the first European printed book, pre-dating even the Gutenberg Bible. Its rather shaky putative assignment was: [Mainz or Basel: Johann Gutenberg, not after 1450.] 36 This opinion was by no means a settled one even in 1954, although there were few alive at that time who were fully engaged in the question. In origin, this was the opinion of the discoverer and first serious student of the Missale speciale in the late nineteenth century, Otto Hupp. Hupp (1859-1949) was a talented graphic artist/engraver and proudly self-educated antiquary, with an exceptional talent for close reasoning and close observation. Besides his contributions to printing history, he became a major figure in the study of medieval German heraldry. As a young man, Hupp acquired an incomplete copy of the then-undescribed Missale speciale from a Munich bookdealer, but he did not publish on it until 1898. The germ of Hupp's argument, propounded and defended in three trenchant monographs, is that the state of the fount in the Missale speciale is more primitive than in the 1457 Psalter. 37 The formal gothic script imitated or transmuted in the two Psalter founts has a rhythm based on equal-valued minim strokes. The letters c-e-f-g-r-t-x-y have rightward projections which, if not compensated for, disturb this even rhythm. Therefore, the letters written after these "projecting" letters regularly have slightly modified shapes, with reduced leftward projections compensating for their precursors and restoring the regular rhythm. This is virtually the fundamental rule of the gothic hand, and all the earliest Mainz types make attempts to obey the rule by means of filed or specially cast Anschlussbuchstaben—"abutting" letters of variant form—which were set after the projecting letters. In the 1457 Psalter, both founts provide for these required variants by distinctively shaped sorts. The fount of the Gutenberg Bible, which is not after August 1456, similarly provided a full complement of such variant, abutting letter forms. But in the Missale speciale , using the smaller Psalter fount, abutting characters were generally not set. From these considerations one might easily, by leaning on a few suppositions, develop a kind of syllogistic argument for the primacy of the Missale speciale . The Gutenberg Bible is (let us say) essentially the first printed book, and its fount contains abutting sorts. The Mainz Psalter of (let us say) the following year likewise contains abutting sorts. 38 But the Missale speciale , though printed with a Psalter type, contains virtually no abutting sorts. Therefore, we must be at the earliest stage of Gutenberg's typographic experiments. Hupp's views were contested by such formidable scholars as Gottfried Zedler (1860-1945), Konrad Haebler (1857-1946), and, most significantly, Paul Schwenke (1853-1921). It would be impossible to summarize usefully their varying arguments, mixing typographical details with often-unconscious presumptions about what "The Master" Gutenberg would have done, the state of his finances and of his relations with Johann Fust, and so forth, in less than a dozen pages. 39 One seemingly minor and peripheral, but in the long run very prescient, point was raised by Schwenke: the unique copy of the Missale abbreviatum , a shorter issue of the Missale speciale , discovered in 1900, is in a binding surely of Basel provenance. 40 Basel "symptoms" came forward eventually in several other copy histories of the Missale speciale , in textual-liturgical studies of the Missale , and finally in the paper stocks. The idea that the book was printed in Basel was thrown into the mix of opinion. By the 1950s all the chief disputants were dead, and their conflicting opinions had never reached a generally accepted resolution. There was no one left to argue the case against the antiquity of the Missale speciale from original evidence. The greatest work of Gutenberg scholarship in the immediate post-war years, Carl Wehmer's Mainzer Probedrucke (1948), although deeply concerned in questions of how to identify and date the earliest Mainz typography, circumspectly said nothing whatever about the Missale speciale . The influential historian of Gutenberg questions Aloys Ruppel saw however in Hupp's thesis a "very considerable internal and external likelihood". 41 True, Ruppel was fundamentally an industrious compiler, with no special gift for bibliographical analysis; but his opinion carried weight as being that of the chief guardian of Gutenberg's flame. When Stevenson read the news of the Morgan Library's great acquisition, his curiosity was immediately piqued. It must have seemed clear to him that paper evidence would be critical, and that he—perhaps he alone—possessed the mental tools to investigate that evidence. Otto Hupp had already published tracings or drawings of watermarks in the Missale speciale , and Stevenson, then resident on one of his several extended research visits to the Huntington Library, began comparing Hupp's pictures with what he could find in that rich store of incunables. He came across one Strassburg edition in particular, a text of Henricus Ariminensis (Goff H-19), whose long run of Cross on Mounts paper looked to be virtually identical to what Hupp illustrated. This edition, although undated, belonged surely to the early 1470s. At the very end of 1954, while in New York at the M.L.A. convention, Stevenson was finally able, in his words, to "keep his tryst with Constance" in the well-chaperoned Reading Room of the Morgan Library. He put alongside it the Morgan's copy of that same Strassburg incunable and, as he writes, "Within twenty minutes—or was it half an hour?—I knew beyond peradventure that some of the paper in the Missale speciale was the same as the main paper in the Henricus Ariminensis." 42 And then a half-dozen years rolled by, years when as noted Stevenson's main energies were applied to eighteenth-century botanical plate books in Mrs. Hunt's library—a considerable, and demanding departure both from questions of fifteenth-century paper and printing, and from the editions of seventeenth-century English literature, printed mostly on mediocre Norman papers, with which he was most intimately familiar. I would guess that Allan Stevenson got the shock of his scholarly life when, in the spring of 1960, just as his work on the Hunt catalogue was drawing to a close, he learned that two German scholars, working independently of each other, had published separate arguments in support of a conclusion that he must have drawn for himself, but retained unpublished, a half-dozen years earlier: the paper stocks of the Missale speciale did not come into existence until the early 1470s, and consequently the book could not have been printed before that date. One scholar, Gerhard Piccard, made his argument from finding the same papers in dated documents; the other, Theo Gerardy, from finding them in a group of five Strassburg and Basel incunables. Stevenson soon embarked on the task of adding his quota of words to the question. By the beginning of the summer of 1960, he was planning and announcing his own monograph on the subject. 43 There was a definite point to this, first because the community of book scholars was by no means immediately convinced by Piccard's and Gerardy's arguments; and second because Stevenson had considerably stronger bibliographical knowledge in general than did the two German paper historians. Stevenson's evidence, rapidly assembled, was first laid out in a lecture read to the Bibliographical Society in London, February 1961; and was then published the next year, in differing forms, in The Library and in Gutenberg-Jahrbuch . These articles refer again to his projected monograph on the Missale speciale , to be published in 1962 by the Bibliographical Society. As it happens, that book was delayed for five more years, as Stevenson continually revised and expanded his researches. Why, one must wonder, did Stevenson sit on his discovery for so long? He never explained why the startling find he made in 1954 incubated for so long, unseen to the world, apart from once remarking, "there were several years in which I could make but infrequent use of research libraries." 44 There are, however, several hints in the Kansas lecture of November 1959. Toward the end of this lecture Stevenson brought up the topic of the Missale speciale . He spoke about the Galliziani family, Basel paper makers whom he identified as the producers of the Missale speciale's stocks; he discussed the role of paper-stock distribution in assessing the question of whether the Canon of the Mass was the first section of the book to be printed. He went so far even as to state, "I have found the main pair of Missal Bull's heads in several early books printed at Strasbourg and Basel." 45 But he did not acknowledge directly that there was a problem with the Missal's supposed "prototypographical" status. He turned away from the topic with a remark whose intent was perhaps nearly opposite to its strict sense: "I would not deceive you. I am not at this moment marshalling evidence whereby I might fix the date of the 'Constance' Missal." These words were spoken only a few weeks before Theo Gerardy's typescript on the Missale speciale arrived in the mailbox of the Mainz journal Papiergeschichte . Stevenson's remark seems so clearly to call out for interpretation that I think it forgivable to attempt to supply one, although my remarks will be largely speculative. Obviously the Missale speciale had been much on Stevenson's mind since he first saw it in 1954. In view of his fateful day of discovery in the Morgan Library, how could he not have been "marshalling evidence" relevant to the dates of these books? Yet I doubt that Stevenson was simply being secretive or coy before his audience. I would guess that he was, at this moment, still doubtful that he knew enough to form a fully convincing argument against the "Hupp-Morgan Library" date. The generally separatist tradition of incunable studies has left many book-students, working on either side of the 1501 dateline, oddly uncertain of whether the principles of analytical bibliography can be applied to the earlier period. After all, the most eminent American incunabulist, Curt F. Bühler, had published what seemed to be a respectable argument that even the Greg-Bowers collational formula did not apply easily to incunables. 46 One would not have wanted to enter this seemingly mysterious realm of medieval printing unguardedly. Stevenson's hypothesized reluctance or uncertainty may be expressed in an earlier passage of the Kansas lecture, where, after discussing the Galliziani mills in Basel, Stevenson turns away with the remark, "As for me, I like to live in the seventeenth century" ( Observations , p. 9). The seeming authority of Bühler, a convinced "prototypograph" with regard to the Missale speciale , may well have been the most tangible obstacle standing between Stevenson and the gates of the fifteenth century. No reminiscences of Stevenson suggest that he was a shy or taciturn man. If at the end of 1954 he found in the Morgan reading room identical paper in the Missale speciale and in a Strassburg book of ca. 1473, we may feel fairly certain that before he left the Library he shared the happy discovery with Bühler. 47 Several months later, in his prefatory essay to Briquet's Opuscula , Stevenson laid his first printed clue that something might be amiss in the dating of the Missale speciale . He pointed out the inadequacies of an early discussion of the Missal papers by Briquet (who did not personally examine the Missale speciale ), but noted that Briquet "placed himself with those who have held that the Missal is later than the 42-line Bible." He concluded, "The matter is fascinating and might be explored further. . . ." 48 The supposition that the eminent Bühler and the obscure Stevenson were already in conscious but unpublished conflict over the date of the Missale speciale suggests a point to what would otherwise be a somewhat inscrutable article by Bühler two years later, expressing deep reservations about the validity of paper evidence for dating books. 49 This article is, I think it fair to say, primarily a work of rhetoric rather than close reasoning. Bühler concatenated approvingly the published doubts of a variety of eminent scholars in several fields—Sir Henry Thomas, Dard Hunter, Arthur M. Hind, A. E. Popham, Karl Löffler, Fritz Milkau, Ronald B. McKerrow, Lawrence C. Wroth—regarding the usefulness of watermarks in dating manuscripts, printed books, maps and prints. He did not concern himself with whether any of these men had ever made a competent (by the standards of, say, Stevenson) study of paper stocks. It was sufficient that they were worthies and that they had expressed their doubts. Bühler cited, from other authorities, several apparent examples of decades-long use of the same papers in fifteenth-century printing shops; but these instances are, we now know, entirely inaccurate. 50 Perhaps most curious of all is that, although the title of Bühler's article refers to "the dates of fifteenth-century books," no specific fifteenth-century book comes under discussion as being at issue. One has almost the impression that this was a sort of set-question from a medieval disputation. Stevenson makes brief appearances in Bühler's arguments. Stevenson's inferred date of 1477 for Caxton's History of Jason (Goff L-112) was allowed as valid, on the grounds that eleven other writers had already proposed that same date. But since most of these authorities simply took their date from Blades, this does not encounter the question of how to assess paper evidence over against other evidence for the dates of books; it is not a matter of counting authorities. Bühler observed that Stevenson's own discovery of a 1608-dated watermark in one of the Pavier quartos would never in itself have pointed specifically to 1619 as the date of printing. Stevenson would undoubtedly have agreed with this, but would have seen immediately what Bühler had no inclination to consider: that there is a difference between the patterns and conditions of use of substantial stocks of paper, and those of exiguous remnants. 51 Bühler admitted, finally, that watermark evidence could be a tool for dating an incunable "possibly within a score or so of years"—which as it happens is just about the interval between his favored date (ca. 1450), and Stevenson's, for the still-unmentioned Missale speciale . He concluded, "It has not been demonstrated . . . that watermarks provide the incunabulists with that absolute criterion which some filigranologists believe to see in them." But which filigranologists are those, and where did they make their "absolute" remarks? The reader is left to wonder. I suspect that Bühler's goal was to present a construct of doubt about the use of watermarks in dating incunables sufficiently colorable that he should be relieved of the burden of ever having to think about them again. Methodologically, the single greatest failing of Bühler's argument was a neglect to consider carefully the distinction between watermark evidence as providing a terminus a quo, and a terminus ante quem. Watermark evidence may reflect usefully on both termini, but it is much harder to oppose the indications for a terminus a quo than for a terminus ante quem. Consider: one wants to date an undated book to, say, 1460, but evidence emerges that its paper stock cannot be found in dated use until 1470, when various examples occur. One may be tempted at first to argue that the search for dated uses has been an imperfect one, and that many examples earlier than 1470 may yet be found. But if the search continues and they do not emerge, the wished-for date of 1460 becomes greatly doubtful. The book cannot be printed until its paper is made, and if the evidence becomes strong that the paper was made in 1470, that becomes the starting point of a range of possible dates. Suppose, on the other hand, that one wants to date the book to 1480, but again its paper is found in dated use only in 1470. It may be unreasonable or arbitrary to date a book ten years after the time its paper was made, but it will never seem impossible to make the argument. One simply postulates (whether correctly or not is a separate question) a period of storage for these particular reams. When Bühler allowed the possibility of using paper evidence to date an incunable "possibly within a score or so of years," he failed to define "within." Did this mean a score of years after the earliest evidence for the paper's existence, or a range of, say, ten years on either side of that date? The distinction is critical, and the latter interpretation could hardly be supported. The question of chronological termini from paper evidence became critical when Piccard's and Gerardy's studies of the Missale speciale appeared in early 1960. 52 Before this pair of publications, over decades of heated controversy, the bibliographical world knew, and paid attention to, the Missale speciale papers only from three tracings supplied by Hupp, showing a Cross on Mounts and two Bull's Heads with Tau (S. Anthony Cross) surmounts, the one head notably broader than the other. 53 Piccard and Gerardy both succeeded first in defining the stocks adequately by identifying twins, and then in finding dated or datable uses of the same stocks in various paper documents and incunables. Hupp's Cross on Mounts tracing had, of course, a twin. His two Bull's Head tracings turned out to be twins of a single stock (hereafter BHT I), and Piccard and Gerardy found also a second, less common Bull's Head Tau stock (BHT II). 54 Piccard, who had for years been taking tracings of watermarks from documents in many archives, identified six documents written on BHT I, dated between 1472 and 1474; two on BHT II, dated 1473-1474; and seven on Cross, dated 1473-1476. Gerardy, whose archival researches were less far-ranging, found three more documentary uses of BHT I, dated 1474-1477. His main clue, however, was provided by an earlier album of watermarks in Strassburg incunables, edited by Paul Heitz. 55 Gerardy recognized (as had Stevenson) that all three watermarked stocks of the Missal were represented by Heitz's tracings. By tracking down Heitz's references, Gerardy found four Strassburg and Basel incunables using one or more of the Missal stocks (Goff E-166, G-399, H-19, V-2). Although the four editions are without imprint, the consensus of incunable literature dated all of them to approximately 1472-1474. Besides this group. Gerardy found one Basel incunable, dated 4 December 1478 (Goff P-452), whose stocks include a later state of BHT I, with both wiremarks showing deformations. If one accepted that Gerardy and Piccard had accurately identified all these marks—and both of them were fully aware of the principle of defining a stock by its twin marks and moulds—then it must have been clear that there now existed massive evidence that the Missale speciale could not be earlier than 1472, and was very probably datable to about 1473-1474. Piccard's documentation and Gerardy's did not overlap at a single point, yet both arrived at the same dates. If these three paper stocks were hypothesized to have existed as early as 1450 or before, where could all the earlier datable uses be hiding? The immediate response to Piccard's and Gerardy's findings was, however, rather dusty. At the moment their articles appeared, Schmidt-Künsemüller was just coming to the end of his laborious, highly detailed "Forschungsbericht" on the Missale speciale question. This study, distinguished by a clear grasp of the multitudinous opinions concerning the evidence of the Missal's type, seemed to have worked itself into an awkward corner. The Missal type could apparently be defined with some accuracy as an early state of the smaller fount used in the Mainz Psalter with colophon signed by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, 14 August 1457 (Goff P-1036). As Schmidt-Künsemüller correctly remarked, a distinction must be drawn, however, between the date of the fount, and its time of use. 56 The other chief factor to be considered was the wide variety of Basel "symptoms" in the bindings and provenances of the known copies of the Missale speciale and Missale abbreviatum . This led Schmidt-Künsemüller to postulate two highly conflicting alternatives. The Missale speciale might date to ca. 1444-1448, the time of Gutenberg's "lost years" when he could be located neither in Strassburg nor in Mainz; or to ca. 1465-1468, when (as it then seemed) printing was first being introduced to Basel through the person of Berthold Ruppel, plausibly identifiable as the Bechtolf von Hanau who is recorded as one of Gutenberg's workmen in 1456. 57 Since a full two decades separate the alternatives, this was not an entirely happy conclusion. It is fair to say that when the "Wasserzeichenforscher" laid their wares before Schmidt-Künsemüller, producing a date distinctly different from either of his painfully arrived-at alternatives, he was instinctively disposed to resist their conclusion. He was annoyed by Piccard's dogmatic declaration that watermark evidence is purely objective and conclusive; and he rightly rejected Gerardy's suggestion that the Missal was probably printed in Strassburg by Georg Reyser. 58 Yet his own dictum, that "the span of use [of watermarks] is certainly greater than the watermark specialists would have it," is just as "apodiktisch" as any of Piccard's remarks, and considerably less justified by an identifiable body of evidence. 59 It should have been clear from Piccard's and Gerardy's data, unless one doubted their fundamental accuracy, that 1472 stood forth strongly as a terminus a quo, however long after that date one might suppose that the paper stocks continued to be used. Schmidt-Künsemüller closed with a declaration that "the riddle of the Missale speciale is unsolved," and that one can only hope for a "new archival find" to solve it. 60 Stevenson's own researches on the Missale speciale were laid out briefly in his articles in The Library and in Gutenberg-Jahrbuch , 1962, and in full in the long-delayed Problem of the Missale speciale , 1967. In the Missale speciale he found the "problem" that most fully vindicated his earlier apostolic writings on the value of paper evidence, and that equaled or surpassed in significance the master Greg's study of the Pavier quartos. By normal standards of evidence, Stevenson's article in Gutenberg-Jahrbuch , coming in the trail of Piccard's and Gerardy's work and enlarging to nine the number of other incunables of the 1470s containing Missal paper, should have fully convinced the bibliographical world that the terminal year from which to begin considering possible dates for the Missale speciale was 1472. If for no other reason, it should have been clear in 1962 that this "paper stock" date fits very well indeed with the scattered and independent copy-history indications. Long ago, as briefly noticed above (note 40), Paul Schwenke had shown that the binding of the unique Missale abbreviatum shares tools with several bindings surely localizable to Basel, these bindings being on Basel imprints of the 1470s. The Morgan copy of Missale speciale was in a binding which had once contained documentary waste datable to Basel, 1473. 61 Most recently, a fourth copy of the Missale speciale had been identified among the so-called duplicates of the City Library of Augsburg. This copy, formerly belonging to the Augustinian convent of Augsburg, is in its original binding from an anonymous shop of that city whose "floruit" was ca. 1470 to 1489. A binding from the shop in the City Library of virtually identical layout covers two incunables of 1475 and 1476. 62 These elements of copy history had never been given their proper weight. As already suggested, the various "Basel symptoms" among them had been noticed, but the fact that they likewise suggested a relatively late date was generally overlooked. It surely is a valid criticism of Hupp and other adherents of the "early" school that they were able so comfortably to see the Missale as both Gutenberg's first book, and as probably a Basel book, despite the entire absence of evidence that Gutenberg was ever in Basel. They should have seen a danger signal here, warning them not to place one assumption on top of another and call it a foundation. The warning was lost, however, on those who were determined to believe whatever it was necessary to believe in support of a preconceived conclusion. However bright or flickering the light of pure reason may have been in the bibliographical minds of 1962, it is fortunate that Stevenson was impelled to proceed with a full monograph on the Missale speciale . The question of the Missal's date was one of the major cruxes in the history of the invention of printing, and well deserved, after more than six decades of controversy, a definitive statement. The resulting book, moreover, gave Stevenson an opportunity to display the full range of his bibliographical and historical talents, which were by no means confined to studying watermarks. As to paper evidence, perhaps the chief methodological advance of The Problem of the Missale speciale was its thorough exposition of the evidential role of changing states of watermarks and consequently of paper stocks. Stevenson's "Watermarks are Twins" had illustrated and discussed the changing states of watermarks in Inigo Jones's Stone-Heng , 1655. He showed that the reams used to print that edition contained a variety of states of the handsome Pot watermarks, reflecting a process of shifting and deformation of the wiremarks, as the moulds suffered their quotidian knocks. Some of these changes of state must have involved resewing of elements of the wiremark. Although the Stone-Heng provided an instructive example of the pure phenomenon, Stevenson drew no bibliographical argument from it. But it is surely safe to assert that no paper stock had ever been so thoroughly investigated before, with regard to the small changes of state, over the passage of time, reflected in its reams. A sensitivity to the possibility of finding variant states of a paper stock greatly expands the potential for using paper evidence effectively. When it is asserted, for instance, that "the same" paper is used over a long period of time, perhaps the first question to investigate (given that we are truly dealing with the product of a single pair of moulds) is whether this is all paper in the same state; or whether there are variations of state reflecting different times of manufacture. Changes of state lie on a wide spectrum of variation, from small shifts in the position of the wiremark, still preserving the locations of its sewing dots; to reshaping of the mark, often with changes of some of the sewing dots; to removal of the wiremark, and complete resewing—perhaps with the mark put back on the mould front to back, hence mirrored; and finally, to the transfer of one or both of the wiremarks to a new mould or moulds. At this latter point, we are dealing with the same marks, but a new stock. The situation is further complicated by the fact that, as Stevenson showed clearly in Stone-Heng , each mould will exemplify a separate series of changes. Stevenson documented examples of all these types of variation at some place or other in his writings, and post-Stevensonians have come to realize that this is the common way with handmade paper. In the Missale speciale , changing states play the significant role of vitiating one possible objection from the doubters. The Cross paper of the Missal apparently remains in the same state in all recorded uses; but the two Bull's Head stocks both witness changes, and in both instances the Missal states are not the earliest known. A clearly earlier state of BHT I is found in substantial runs in Eggestein's editio princeps of the Legenda aurea of Jacobus de Voragine (Goff J-81); and a slightly variant earlier state in the same printer's edition of S. Gregory's Dialogi (Goff G-399). This latter edition also shows an earlier state of BHT II than occurs in the Missal. The implications are useful. In the theoretical case, one might argue that a pair of moulds was put to use in, say, 1450, to produce a run of paper, then laid aside for a couple of decades before being used again. But when we find, as with the Missal stocks, that an inclusive range of states of the papers, including earlier states, came into use within a year or so of each other—and this is, indeed, the usual situation—the theoretical argument loses its force. Since the appearance of The Problem of the Missale speciale , the Piccard-Gerardy-Stevenson interpretation of the chronology of the Missal stocks has been accepted as conclusive. Their combined investigations have discovered one or other of the Missal stocks in more than two dozen paper documents written in many parts of Germany and Switzerland, and (often in long runs) in eleven other incunables printed in Strassburg, Basel, Speyer, and Mainz. None of these "outside uses" can be dated before 1472. Although the Strassburg incunables in which much Missal paper is found are uniformly undated, no sceptical incunabulist has had the energy to try to put together an argument that these books, like the Missale speciale , in fact belong to the 1440s or 1450s, not 1470s! Chance subsequent discoveries have confirmed the chronology of use of these papers. Stevenson argued that Eggestein's edition of Voragine Legenda aurea probably dated to 1472, and was followed by the edition of Gregory, Dialogi . At the time he wrote, no dated purchaser's or rubricator's inscriptions were known for either book, to verify or cast doubt on these inferred dates from the state of the paper stocks. However, it may now be noted that the Donaueschingen copy of Legenda aurea contains a purchase inscription of April 1472; and that a copy of Gregory's Dialogi acquired by the Morgan Library in 1986 contains a rubricator's inscription dated 1473. Perhaps the sole informed doubter by the late 1960s was Curt Bühler, who had invested considerable emotional energy in his belief and argument that the Missale speciale was to be rightly seen as the first European printed book. He pushed hard a long-standing argument within the Missal Controversy that the Missal's omission of an office for the Feast of the Presentation of the Virgin (21 November) proved that it must have been printed before 30 August 1468, when the Archbishop of Mainz proclaimed that the Feast was of obligatory celebration. 63 And yet it is clear that the Missale speciale , a very flawed production in many ways, was not produced under diocesan authority or supervision of any kind. Few besides Bühler have experienced difficulty in believing that the Missale speciale was simply set from a manuscript which, rightly or wrongly, commonly or uncommonly, omitted this office. Bühler also came forward with more general doubts on the validity of paper evidence, but it may briefly be said that these do not meet the specific case. 64 Although this study is not concerned specifically with the history of the Missale speciale controversy, it seems necessary to make some remark on whether the paper evidence is in conflict with the typographical evidence. An extensive line of scholars supposed, or at least felt the force of the argument, that the (general) absence of abutting forms in the Missal indicated its Psalter type to be in a very primitive state. The scholar most informed on the changing states of the Psalter founts, Sir Irvine Masson, essentially agreed with this interpretation, although he believed that this served to take the Missal-state of the fount back only to about 1454, not to the 1440s. Stevenson showed that even Masson overlooked a good many instances of abutting sorts in the Missale speciale , created by filing "primary" sorts rather than by special castings. It remains true, however, that broadly speaking the Missale speciale lacks abutting forms, creating what to the sensitive eye is a strikingly loose, arrhythmic page that seems to violate the gothic modulus. There is still work to be done with the Missal fount, now that we are released from the presumption that it must be primitive. It is possible that it does represent a primitive or experimental form of the Psalter type from the early 1450s, which migrated to Basel (very possibly via Gutenberg's workman, Bechtolf von Hanau = Berthold Ruppel) and was used about twenty years after its creation. It should be considered, however, whether we see rather in the Missal primarily the habits of a compositor who was in 1473 no longer used to obeying the "gothic rules." Although the history of the phenomenon remains to be fully explored, it is evident that the 1470s was a time when many type founts, and compositors, began to move away from the attempt to conform closely to scribal habits. Types tended to show a reduced number of sorts having special "positional" setting rules, and compositors became more careless of or oblivious to such rules. 65 It may be, therefore, that in the loose settings of the Missale speciale we see not signs of a primitive fount, but rather "1470s" compositorial symptoms. In 1959, Stevenson told his audience, "I like to live in the seventeenth century." But in the last decade of his life, he lived mostly in the fifteenth, and in Europe. A series of grants and the support of many of the staff of the British Museum, and of the Hellingas in Amsterdam, permitted Stevenson to take up a variety of intensive researches in fifteenth-century topics besides his Missale speciale work. He was energized by the stimulus, after the Pittsburgh years, of access to the great European libraries. Perhaps equally stimulating to his imagination were visits to the traditional French papermaking centers of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, and the opportunities to work in a number of local archives where he often found particularly early examples of the output from the twinned moulds of neighboring papermills. Much of the work undertaken in these years remained unfinished and unpublished. The most ambitious project was that of investigating the long-controverted dates of Netherlandish and German blockbooks. These picture-books, printed onto paper from woodblocks by a process of rubbing, are with very few exceptions unlocalized, unsigned, and undated. They seem characteristically to have been made not in single substantial editions, but in numerous smaller impressions—perhaps, even, to individual order in some cases—each impression being defined by its own paper stock(s). When the record of the paper supply is correlated with that of progressive damage to one or more blocks in a blockbook set, many potential clues to both relative and absolute chronology and to localization will emerge. It was Stevenson's ambition to build up a corpus of paper-stock analysis of essentially all surviving copies of all blockbooks. His preliminary views, based on an examination of about one hundred blockbook copies, were made public in lectures at the University of Amsterdam at the end of 1965. Stevenson was able to verify from its paper stocks that the unique Rylands Library copy of Apocalypse I was indeed apparently printed in c. 1451-1452, but suggested convincingly that most impressions of the main series of blockbook texts— Apocalypse, Ars moriendi , and Biblia pauperum —belong rather to the 1460s. Stevenson's Amsterdam lectures represent work in progress; the full monograph was never completed. 66 Only recently have students of blockbooks begun to follow Stevenson's path of assembling and organizing the material evidence. 67 Methodologically similar studies, combining examinations of the paper in books with archivally-based searches for the locations of the mills producing the papers, led Stevenson likewise into the way of Caxton studies, where his work, though suggestive and indicative, was so preliminary that we can see that its first results are almost all faulty. 68 Stevenson was increasingly ill in these years, and time was running out; his handwriting, always shaky, deteriorated strikingly. His most significant completed work was a study of the printed books containing paper from the mill of John Tate, the first English papermaker; 69 and his re-edition of Briquet's watermark album, where his lengthy introduction provides both a guide on how to use Briquet's album, and an attractive sampling of case studies of how to put paper evidence to use. Stevenson's final publication was an argument, from the provenance of paper stocks, in support of the Hellingas' hint that an edition of Boccaccio, Genealogiae deorum (Goff B-750), conventionally localized to Cologne, might in fact be a Louvain book, representing the earliest stage of Jan Veldener's printing in Louvain. 70 Stevenson died in Chicago, 31 March 1970, shortly before this last piece appeared. He left much unfinished work behind. The blockbook studies, if they had been brought to the state of maturation of The Problem of the Missale speciale , would very probably have been seen as Stevenson's crowning achievement, for here too is an area where the introduction of competent paper evidence drastically changes the status of the question. The uncompleted Unicorns of Normandy was an equally original attempt to write an historical study of how the paper trade affected the printing trade of a country over more than two centuries. No equivalent book seems to exist anywhere; and for the English printing trade, this is probably a study that only Stevenson could have carried through. 71 However, the work Stevenson did accomplish provided the bibliographical world with what is in essence a complete textbook, enlivened by numerous subtle and pretty examples, of how to use paper evidence effectively. Within the history of bibliography there is very distinctly a pre-Stevenson and a post-Stevenson era. I have suggested—without, admittedly, being able to document this from Stevenson's own words—that the appearance of Piccard's and Gerardy's studies of the Missale speciale in 1960 was the critical event in Stevenson's intellectual life, impelling him, at the age of 57, to bring to fruition some major achievement. In the long run it matters little whether Stevenson was first, second, or third into print with an argument that the Missale speciale was printed in the early 1470s. His eventual monograph, The Problem of the Missale speciale , became the definitive statement of the question, and Stevenson lived to see the book acclaimed as a masterpiece. 72 It is, indeed, one of the classics of bibliographical literature. To my mind, among those few classics, at least in the English language, The Problem of the Missale speciale stands alongside John Carter and Graham Pollard's Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets (1934) as a work that invites repeated reading not simply for the importance of its results, its decisive contributions to bibliographical method, its exemplification of the bibliographical mind at work, but also for the sheer pleasure and vitality of its prose. Stevenson was not, quite obviously, a great success in the aspects of academia that have to do with finding jobs and establishing a respectable position for oneself in the company of what are sometimes loosely called peers. He was a slow developer, whose really significant work was not done until in his fifties; academia is not generally receptive to slow developers. His three applications to the Guggenheim Foundation were uniformly unsuccessful. But in the matter of knowing how to engage his readers, how to communicate to them that scholarship ought to be, whatever else it is, a source of mental pleasure—Stevenson was in a class by himself. He was a lord of language, projecting an authorial persona seemingly ever in high spirits at the sheer innocent joy of finding things out: "On a perfect morning in July, when I might have been bowling on the greens at Arroyo Seco, I made a minor Shakespearian discovery." 73 When he writes about the Bull's Heads of the Missale speciale , a fantasy world opens out and we are led into the Edenic fields of "Filigranistan": 74 Wideface and his brother gaze blandly forth from the 16-mm. window between [the type columns] . . . In state 1 the face looks forth from the windows; in the second it has swung behind the shrubbery . . . finally I come upon these amiable oxen in a dated book. . . . [In a late state of the stock,] These old fellows, full of agues and distempers, have been pressed into service long after they should have laid down their burdens . . . we may raise our eyes again and observe other Bulls grazing in the meadow . . . this second pair, in 1473, or thereabouts, look as pure as spring daisies in a cow pasture. . . . For some time his boon companion, Leveleye, leads a charmed life; yet he too loses his youthful graces. With regard to authorial persona, I am particularly struck by Stevenson's article in the 1962 Gutenberg-Jahrbuch , "Paper Evidence and the Missale speciale ," where he first presented in some detail his own researches into this hitherto mysterious book. When one considers the disappointment Stevenson must have felt at having been anticipated, in print, in his amazing discovery, and general disappointment at his very ambiguous career, one can think of a dozen ways that disgruntlement, envy, injured pride, defensiveness could have crept into his words. Add to this the undeniably more austere tradition of the German scholarly forum. Who but Stevenson, at that time and in that place, would have announced his arrival on the scene of Missale speciale battles with these words: On a day in October 1961 I climbed up and again up into the ancient drying lofts of the Rychmühle in the Sankt Albantal, Basel, once the proud paper-mill of Michael Galliziani. "Four hundred and eighty-eight years ago," I remarked to the several pigeons assembled for the occasion, "the Cross paper for the 'Constance' Missal must have been set to dry on ropes in this place."

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * For useful references and comments I am grateful to John Bidwell, G. Thomas Tanselle, and David Vander Meulen. I recall with special pleasure Rachel Stevenson's kindness, some years ago, in presenting to me offprints of most of her husband's articles, and photocopies of several of his unfinished projects. Many of Stevenson's research notes are now in Princeton University Library. Stevenson's chief writings on paper, most of which are discussed in the following pages, are separately listed at the end in chronological order. 1 Asgar Aaboe, Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics (1964), p. 2. 2 In the absence of a settled vocabulary, I use the term "scholarship" to mean the reasoned study of artefacts of all kinds; and "bibliography," the study of printed books. The corresponding study of manuscripts is most commonly called "palaeography," giving to that word a broader meaning than its etymology would imply. This broader sense seems to me to be implicit in, e.g., Ludwig Traube, "Geschichte der Paläographie," in his Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen , ed. Franz Boll, 1 (Munich, 1909), 1 sqq.; and in Bernhard Bischoff, Latin Palaeography , tr. Dáibhí ó Cróinin and David Ganz (Cambridge, 1990), p. 1. In this latter work, "codicology" seems to be treated as a sub-genre of palaeography. It is obvious that palaeography and bibliography, by the definitions just given, are intimately related, and share a number of virtually identical underlying concerns; but their histories have never been treated together. 3 Paul Needham, The Bradshaw Method (1988), with references to other studies on Bradshaw. 4 "James Shirley and the Actors at the First Irish Theater," Modern Philology 40 no. 2 (Nov. 1942), 147-160, at p. 157 n. 53: in discussing the five plays by Fletcher and Shirley entered in the Stationers' Register 25 April 1639, Stevenson notes "The quartos [including Shirley's Opportunitie ] are linked by typographical features and watermarks." 5 If we presume that a large number of copies—say 1,000 to 1,500—of an edition sheet was printed on equal supplies of two different paper stocks, and if we have a random sample of a dozen such sheets, the probability is about .23 that the sample will divide neatly into six sheets of one watermark, and six of the other, and about .77 that the sample will show some different mixture, anything from no example of one of the stocks, to five examples of one and seven of the other. 6 Stevenson specifically cited Hinman's "New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual 1941 , 208-214; and Bowers's "An Examination of the Method of Press Correction in Lear ," The Library 5th ser., 2 (1947-48), 20-44. 7 Kenneth Povey, "On the Diagnosis of Half-sheet Impositions," The Library 5th ser. 11 (1956), 268-272 at p. 270: "In a crisp copy . . . the order of printing can often be determined from the relationship between the indentations of the type." Compare idem, "A Century of Press Figures,' ibid., 14 (1959), 251-273 at p. 257: ". . . headline skeletons, if they occur, sometimes help to determine the order of printing, but real proof depends on an examination of the indentations of the type in a copy which preserves them." See also idem, "The Optical Identification of First Formes," SB , 13 (1960), 189-190. The same "sequence test" is clearly described by Heinrich Wallau, "Die zweifarbigen Initialen der Psalterdruke von Johann Fust und Peter Schöffer," in Festschrift zum fünfhundertjährigen Geburtstage von Johann Gutenberg (Mainz, 1900), 261-304 at p. 280: "Der seitenweise Druck zunächst ist durch die Thatsache erwiesen, dass die Psalterdrucke von 1457 und 1459 durchweg 'vorwärtslaufenden' zeigen, d.h. die Schattierung der Abdrücke erweist unzweifelhaft, dass stets Recto vor Verso gedruckt wurde." 8 McKenzie, "Printers of the Mind," Studies in Bibliography 22 (1969), 1-75; cf. p. 2, "Our ignorance about printing-house conditions in the 17th and 18th centuries has left us disastrously free to devise them according to need; and we have at times compounded our errors by giving a spurious air of 'scientific' definitiveness to our conclusions." See pp. 23 sqq. for McKenzie's criticisms of bibliographical arguments as to order of presswork and number of presses based on patterns of skeleton formes. 9 "New Uses," p. 152: the quartos all fall "in or about February-March-April 1639/40." 10 The plays are: (1) John Fletcher, Wit Without Money , Cotes for Crooke &amp; Cooke, 1639. Greg 563, STC 1691. (2) ___, The Night Walker , Cotes for Crooke &amp; Cooke, 1640. Greg 574, STC 11072. (3) James Shirley, The Maid's Revenge , Cotes for Cooke, 1639. Greg 562, STC 22450, 22450a. (4) ___, The Humorous Courtier , Cotes for Cooke, 1640. Greg 577, STC 22447. (5) ___, The Coronation , Cotes for Crooke &amp; Cooke, 1640. Greg 572, STC 22440. (6) ___, The Opportunitie , Cotes for Crooke &amp; Cooke, 1640. Greg 575, STC 22451, 22451a, 22452. (7) ___, Love's Cruelty , Cotes for Crooke, 1640. Greg 573, STC 22449. All were entered in the Stationers' Register in either April or July of 1639. Some stocks of this mixed lot of papers recur, as Stevenson notes, in two other plays printed by Cotes in 1640 (both entered 2 April 1640): (8) Robert Chamberlain, The Swaggering Damsel , Cotes for Crooke, 1640. Greg 589, STC 4946. (9) William Habington, The Queen of Aragon , F°, Cotes for Cooke, 1640. Greg 588, STC 12587. Compare Revised STC I, p. xxxviii, ". . . for ordinary publications old-style dating should not be assumed without corroborative evidence." 11 An historical study focussed on the use of paper evidence in analytical bibliography generally would give more particular attention to John Carter and Graham Pollard, An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (134), and to A. T. Hazen, A Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press (1942). Some link between the two is provided by John Carter's several studies ( Bibliographical Notes and Queries , May 1936 and April 1938) of the then-mysterious "thick-paper" copies of Odes by Mr. Gray , 4°, "1757," which Hazen eventually demonstrated to be an unauthorized reprint of ca. 1790 by Thomas Kirgate. 12 Fine eighteenth-century papers often show remarkably similar twin marks, apparently due to both marks being made by bending wires around pin-boards or other forms of template (cf. Stevenson, The Problem of the Missale speciale [1967], Excursus III, "The Watermark Maker," pp. 245-247; and E. G. Loeber, Paper Mould and Mouldmaker [1982], pp. 31 sqq.): for examples, see "Watermarks are Twins," figs. 5, 6. But the forewarned eye can still distinguish them. It may be worth quoting again the papermaker James Whatman Jr.'s deposition, 1770 (Thomas Balston, James Whatman Father and Son [1957], pp. 147-148), at the trial of Edward Burch and Matthew Martin, who were accused of forging a 1764-dated will of Sir Andrew Chadwick, Bart. (d. 1768). The will was written on Whatman paper, and Whatman was asked how he could date its manufacture: "Do you form your judgment merely from the JW [or from] other marks?" He replied: "From other marks; these are a particular mould; they were first began to be used in January 1768 . . . this is made on a mould which is the first mould in which two sheets of this kind of paper was made at once; I am the first person that made it double, two sheets at once; they were in January 1768; and the first . . . ever sent to London was the 11th of March 1768." On cross examination he was asked, "Could not any body copy your work?" and replied, "I have ordered several pair of moulds to be made alike, but never saw any two pair alike; they will differ in a wire or something." I would nominate Messrs. Burch and Martin, who swung for their incuriosity, as the patron saints of the bibliographical obscuri viri who continue to misprise the uses of paper evidence. 13 Taken from P. Needham, "The Paper Supply of the Gutenberg Bible," PBSA , 79 (1985), 303-374 at p. 317. 14 mR/mL is a variant of Stevenson's eventual formulation mRF°; the F° seems to me unnecessary, and it is convenient to add here an identification of the chain-space location of the mark. 15 See David Vander Meulen, "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad ," SB 37 (1984): 58-81, with much useful information on chainline and tranchefile patterns in eighteenth-century papers. Even in the fifteenth century, there is at least one complication which my specimen description above does not encounter. In Italian papers of that time, it is common to find that the watermark is sewn to an "interpolated" chainline, whose distance from its neighbors is less than that of the other chainspaces. 16 It has been said, in favor of felt-side reproductions, that this is like looking directly at the mould. But why, one might ask, does it matter whether conceptually one is looking at the mould directly, rather than through the looking glass? By the same argument, one might for bibliographical purposes favor reversed reproductions of printing, on the grounds that this is like looking directly at the type. 17 But David Vander Meulen (cited note 15 above) has shown how useful Stevenson's measurement system can be, when it is further developed and extended to record the variations in chain-spacing across the entire mould. 18 When, that is, the marks are centered in one half of the sheet or the other; there are also, of course, instances of "centermarks." 19 Walter W. Greg, "On Certain False Dates in Shakespearian Quartos," The Library , New ser. 9 (1908), 113-131; 381-409. 20 Greg's English Printed Drama and STC (18796, 22291, 22293, 22297, 22300, 22303, 22341, and 26101) both count these as eight editions, but it will be convenient to treat the last of these, containing The Whole Contention between York and Lancaster (viz. 2 and 3 Henry VI) and Pericles , as two editions. Although Pericles is quired continuously with the two preceding plays, their joint title-page does not mention Pericles , and Pericles has its own title-page, with imprint and date, on a singleton leaf. 21 "The Shakespeare Quartos of 1619," Modern Philology , 8 (1910), 145-163. For further discussion of Greg's evidence, and of resultant arguments and consequences, see F. P. Wilson, "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography,'" in The Bibliographical Society 1892-1942: Studies in Retrospect (1945), 76-135 at pp. 78 sqq., calling this Greg's "most spectacular discovery" (reprinted as Shakespeare and the New Bibliography , revised and edited by Helen Gardner (1970), see pp. 7-10); Greg, English Printed Drama , III, 1107-08; and Peter Blayney, "Compositor B and the Pavier Quartos," The Library , 5th ser. 27 (1972), 179-206. 22 The paper stocks of the Pavier quartos remain incompletely described. A fuller record could well reflect further on their order of printing and on other questions. The survival rate of the Pavier quartos is strikingly high, over 30 copies each (about triple the average of the other pre-First Folio Shakespearean quartos), so an unusually full sheet-by-sheet record could in principle be gathered. 23 Compare also Stevenson's remarks in the Hunt Botanical Catalogue , vol. II pt. 1 (1961), p. cxli: Greg was "the greatest bibliographer of our time"; Stevenson's bibliographical introduction to this catalogue is implicitly dedicated to Greg. 24 "Wasserzeichen und Papier der zweiundvierzigzeiligen Bibel," Gutenberg-Jahrbuch 1952 , 21-29. Stevenson, "Watermarks are Twins," p. 87, noted briefly that the Gutenberg Bible's papers must be twins, but his specific remarks, inferred from watermark reproductions in Dziatzko's pioneering study of the Bible, are very inaccurate. 25 Johannes Gutenbergs zweiundvierzigzeilige Bibel: Ergänzungsband zur Faksimile-Ausgabe (1923), 26 sqq. 26 Because of the fineness of the wires and chains of the Piedmontese moulds supplying the Gutenberg Bible shop, the mould and felt sides can be difficult to distinguish. For more details and analysis of the paper evidence, see my study, "The Paper Supply of the Gutenberg Bible," PBSA 79 (1985), 303-374. Kazmeier's four Bull's Head stocks are actually best defined as two stocks, of which one shows three chronologically distinct states, each represented by a different sewing of the twin wiremarks to their respective moulds, with slight reshapings. 27 Stevenson's corrections to Heawood were incorporated in the first reprint, 1957. 28 Heawood Review (1951), p. 7 note 17; "Briquet and the Future of Paper Studies," note 48; Observations on Paper as Evidence (1961), note 1, respectively. Under this last title, Stevenson's project continued to be announced as "forthcoming" for some years, e.g. The Problem of the Missale Speciale (1967), p. 282 (note V 28). 29 Since there is, as Stevenson noted, a 50-50 chance that an inserted leaf will show a mould-side sequence as if it were part of the original sheet, it may be necessary to examine a number of copies. As Povey (cited note 8) pointed out, the test of sequence of type impressions may also reveal hidden cancels. Both tests may, in fact, be thought of as "conjugacy analysis." The first can show that leaves hypothesized to belong to the same sheet could not have been folded to produce the mould-side sequence one finds in a copy; the second similarly can show that type-pages hypothesized to have been in the same forme could not have been printed together. 30 Hunt Botanical Catalogue 595 (Gautier d'Agoty's Collection des plantes , 1767) and 539 (Trew's Plantae selectae , 1750-1773) respectively. It would perhaps have been better to give the format of these books as Broadside, reserving F° for books with conjugate leaves. 31 See Paul Needham, "ISTC as a Tool for Analytical Bibliography," in L. Hellinga and J. Goldfinch, eds., Bibliography and the Study of Fifteenth-Century Civilisation (1987), 39-54 at pp. 46-47. I noted there that Goff designates [most, as I should have stated] broadsides as "Bdsde(f°)", where the qualifier f° is at best meaningless: f° is one format, Broadside another. Moreover, Goff's practice, derived from Stillwell's, is, I now see, also inconsistent. Compare Goff I-130 and I-131, two settings of a broadside Indulgence. The first is called Bdsde(4°), the second Bdsde(f°). In fact, they are virtually twins, and of the same format, which may be unambiguously identified as: Bdsde (¼-sheet, oblong). One may also note that STC 2 generally uses the abbreviation "s.sh.", i.e. "single-sheet", to describe English broadsides which only very rarely are literally that, viz. single sheets. In the great majority of cases they are fractions of a sheet. In an even more confused variation of this system, the famous Caxton placard advertizing the Sarum Ordinal is described by STC 2 4890 as "½ sh. obl. fol." Except for obl. , I find this format statement virtually impossible to interpret. The advertisement leaf is a quarter-sheet of paper, and hence to be described: Bdsde (¼-sheet, oblong). All these remarks only reinforce the recommendations of Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), pp. 195-196, who speaks inter alia of "the utter illogicality" of using "single sheet" to indicate a broadside half-sheet. Bowers's formulations 1°, ½°, ¼° for full sheets, half-sheets and quarter-sheets are indeed more compendious than my own use of Bdsde (½-sheet) or Brs (½-sh.) and so on, but the one transposes directly into the other. The choice of formulation must be made by weighing the economy of the one expression against the closer approach to spoken language of the other. 32 I have made recommendations for identifying paper sizes of fifteenth-century books in "ISTC as a Tool for Analytical Bibliography," [cited preceding note], pp. 41 sqq. These recommendations relate to the four chief sizes of that time. I have since identified a number of less common sizes, which I discuss in a forthcoming issue of Princeton University Library Chronicle . Gaskell used John Johnson, Typographia (1824), as source for paper sizes and names; Stevenson, Hunt Botanical Catalogue p. ccxxvii, provides a more extensive chart of sizes and names, based on a wider range of international sources. 33 R. W. Chapman, "An Inventory of Paper, 1674," The Library , New Ser. 7 (1927), 402-408. The document is clearly not an inventory; it is better called a price list, apparently giving a summary of French, Dutch, and Italian papers available from two different merchants or factors, Merreatt and Seward. 34 Cf. "Heawood Review," p. 7, referring to "pot-size moulds"—that is, moulds conforming to a size called Pot or Pott, regardless of whether the wiremarks on these moulds actually depicted Pots. 35 "Briquet," p. XXXVII: "For England the most useful document [on paper sizes] is the Oxford Pricelist, already mentioned; though scholars have misunderstood its manner of listing measurements." On the same page Stevenson clarified the nature of the dimensions given on the Price-List, one size being "16¼ x 10" for the folio, that is . . . 16¼ x 20" for the opened-out sheet." He omitted, however, to note that he himself had been among those (including Chapman and McKerrow) who had previously misunderstood the record. Cf. also "Labarre Review," 1954, p. 60. Stevenson's Observations on Paper as Evidence (1961) emphasizes the significance of paper sizes but with a few erroneous examples. He correctly (p. 8) identifies Audubon's Birds of America (1827-1838) as being in broadsheet rather than folio format, but gives its sheet as approximately the size of (French) Columbier. In fact Audubon's first prospectus names the size, ordered from Whatman Mills, as Double Elephant (however, the prospectus calls the book itself a "double elephant folio," and the misnomer folio for this book seems to be essentially inexpungible). Stevenson also implies (p. 9) that there were but two paper sizes in the fifteenth century, when there were four common sizes. 36 Frederick B. Adams, Jr., Fifth Annual Report to the Fellows of The Pierpont Morgan Library (1954), pp. 17-30. 37 Otto Hupp, Ein Missale speciale Vorläufer des Psalteriums von 1457 (1898; 30 pp.); Gutenbergs erste Drucke: ein weiterer Beitrag zur Geschichte der ältesten Druckwerke (1902; 98 pp.); Zum Streit um das Missale speciale Constantiense (1917; [2] + 142 pp). This statement of Hupps arguments is, of course, reduced to its barest kernel. Hupp continued to publish articles defending his interpretation until as late as 1939, but the three monographs provide all the essential groundwork of his position. 38 The qualifications "let us say" are an attempt to get back to the mind of Hupp. Although one copy of the Gutenberg Bible contains rubricator's dates in August 1456, I think it likely that the Bible was completed in 1455, and perhaps early in that year. More significantly, I think it more than likely that the true first European printing type was the so-called DK or Donatus-Calendar fount. It existed in a perfected form by October 1454, when the 31-line Indulgence was printed; and undated fragments showing less developed states of the fount (but always with provision of abutting forms) very plausibly can be taken back roughly to the period 1450-1453. If the present article were a study of the arguments on the Missale speciale rather than of Stevenson's methodology for using paper evidence, one would be inquiring of every writer on the Missale , "what then is your opinion of the ownership(s) and origin of the DK type?" 39 There are two important reviews of the Missale speciale question: (a) F. A. Schmidt-Künsemüller, "Der Streit um das Missale speciale," in K. Ohly and W. Krieg, eds., Aus der Welt des Bibliothekars: Festschrift für Rudolf Juchhoff (1961), 51-89 (including a check-list of 75 studies on the Missale speciale from 1896 through 1960); (b) Severin Corsten, "Das Missale speciale," in Hans Widmann, ed., Der gegenwärtige Stand der Gutenberg-Forschung (1972), 185-199. As we shall see below, Schmidt-Künsemüller's attempts in 1961 to arrive at a judgment became quite overtaken at the end by the inflow of paper evidence, whose significance he had some difficulties in assessing adequately. 40 Paul Schwenke, "Der Einband des Missale abbreviatum," Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen 22 (1905), 536. 41 Aloys Ruppel, Johannes Gutenberg: sein Leben und sein Werk (2. Auflage, 1947), p. 158: "Deshalb besitzt die These Hupps, dass Gutenberg das Missale speciale als eines seiner Erstlingswerke herstellte, eine sehr grosse innere und äussere Wahrscheinlichkeit." 42 The Problem of the Missale speciale (1967), p. 31. 43 See Observations on Paper as Evidence (1961). The pamphlet is based on a lecture Stevenson delivered at the University of Kansas, 6 November 1959, in which (as we shall examine further) Stevenson referred very discreetly to the Missale speciale question. The footnotes, however, are separately dated from Pittsburgh, 25 June 1960, and in those notes Stevenson twice referred to chapters in his forthcoming book, to be titled The Paper in the Missale speciale . 44 "Paper Evidence and the Missale speciale ," (1962), p. 102. 45 Observations on Paper as Evidence , p. 25. On p. 23, Stevenson referred very specifically to the paper runs in the European copies of the Missale speciale and Missale abbreviatum , preserved in Munich, Zurich, and at the Benedictine convent of St. Paul im Lavanttal, Carinthia, and one might almost think he had by this date personally examined these copies. Yet Stevenson's article in Gutenberg-Jahrbuch 1962 , "Paper Evidence and the Missale speciale ," p. 94, seems to make it clear that he visited these copies for the first time in October 1961. By the kindness of James Helyar at the University of Kansas, I learn that Stevenson supplied the typescript of his lecture for publication on 25 June 1960 (the date of his notes), stating that he had made corrections to the lecture without material change; galleys were sent him in October 1960; final proofs (not surviving) came back from him in late March 1961; and the pamphlet was published before mid-June 1961. The paper stocks of the Zurich and St. Paul ( abbreviatum ) copies were discussed neither by Piccard nor by Gerardy. I would presume that Stevenson's "Kansas" remarks on the paper in these copies were based on the very imperfect earlier literature, in which the two Bull's Head stocks in particular were never adequately sorted out. 46 C. F. Bühler, J. McManaway and L. Wroth, Standards of Bibliographical Description (1949), p. 26; criticized by Paul Needham, The Bradshaw Method (1988), pp. 32-33. 47 Stevenson surely took some ironic pleasure in the thought that what the Morgan Library had acquired at great price and publicity as the first European printed book was in fact an "ordinary" incunable of the 1470s. In correspondence with friends he commonly referred to the Missale speciale as the MI$$AL. 48 Briquet's Opuscula , p. XLI; Stevenson's introduction is dated from the Newberry Library, April 1955. 49 "Watermarks and the Dates of Fifteenth-Century Books," SB 9 (1957), 217-224. 50 See in particular Bühler, "Watermarks," p. 222, quoting the remarks of Karl Schorbach concerning Johann Mentelin's use of "the" Bull's Head paper in both his earliest, ca. 1460, and latest, ca. 1477, imprints; "the" Bull's Head paper means in fact a variety of stocks in several sizes. The resources of the Morgan Library would have been sufficient to clarify this. Bühler, ibid., even more uncritically cites an unclear remark by Paul Heitz suggesting that the same paper was used in a Strassburg document of the mid-fourteenth century and a Strassburg incunable of the 1470s. Sometimes Bühler quoted only so much from an authority as suited his own purposes. Thus, at p. 218 n. 4, to counter Stevenson's suggestion that the average period of use of a given paper stock was about three years, he cites Heawood's Watermarks , p. 31, as expressing "a more hesitant view." But the passage in Heawood that he quotes has a quite different sense. Heawood acknowledged that for older paper, "The idea that paper-moulds had a fairly long life has been pretty generally held," as many as thirty years of use having been suggested—he acknowledged the opinion without endorsing it. But for the later periods—the periods where he had direct knowledge—Heawood states that this idea "is to be questioned." The difference of opinion between Stevenson and Heawood is imaginary. Heawood goes on in the next paragraph to give examples based on English dated watermarks which, however incompletely and tentatively, support Stevenson's view of the relatively brief average lifespan of paper moulds: "[A]n examination of some 80 cases in the first few decades of the 19th Century has given an average interval of not quite three years, and it would be less if cases were thrown out in which the paper was used by a traveller abroad, who evidently took out a stock of paper with him and used it until it was finished." The reader of Bühler's note could never have guessed at the true trend of Heawood's remarks. 51 Cf. The Problem of the Missale speciale (1967), ch. VI, Runs and Remnants. 52 Gerhard Piccard, "Die Datierung des Missale speciale (Constantiense) durch seine Papiermarken," Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens 2, Lieferung 7-9 (1960), 571-584, first published in the 22 February 1960 issue of Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel ; Theo Gerardy, "Die Wasserzeichen des mit Gutenbergs kleiner Psaltertype gedruckten Missale speciale," Papiergeschichte 10 no. 2 (May, 1960), 13-22. 53 Ein Missale speciale (1898), p. 4. 54 A fourth, unwatermarked stock in the Missale speciale has not played a role in dating the book. 55 Les Filigranes des papiers contenus dans les incunables strasbourgeois de la Bibliothèque Impériale de Strasbourg (Strasbourg, 1903). The tracings, made for Heitz, are of high quality; the identifications of the incunables in which they are found are beset by innumerable inaccuracies. With the aid of Heitz, be it noted, the discoveries which Gerardy and Stevenson made in the late 1950s could have been made in 1903. 56 Schmidt-Künsemüller p. 74: "Selbst [Irvine] Masson hat nicht scharf genug zwischen der Herstellung der Schrift und ihrem Gebrauch beim Druck des Psalters geschieden und offenbar nicht genügend berücksichtigt, dass für Psalter und M[issale] sp[eciale] verschiedene Typengüsse benutzt worden." 57 Very few indeed of the earliest Basel books are dated or signed. At the time, there was a respectable argument, based on studies by Kurt Ohly and Victor Scholderer, that printing began in Basel by 1468; I would now argue, particularly on the basis of the Royalsize papers found in the supposed first books of the first printer, Berthold Ruppel, that there is no compelling reason to date any Basel printing earlier than 1471. A date in the later 1460s for the Missale speciale was also argued by Wolfgang Irtenkauf, Ferdinand Geldner, and (in a letter quoted by Schmidt-Künsemüller) Ernst Schulz, on liturgical grounds which are too complex to summarize here, and which are partly superseded by the paper evidence. 58 A suggestion based on the occurrence of Missal papers in books from the anonymous Ariminensis Press in Strassburg, a press which Kurt Ohly had recently assigned to the printer Georg Reyser. I would now argue that the Ariminensis Press designation, first defined by Proctor, is a conflation of several distinct shops, and that the Ariminensis type 1 editions—the ones in question—are much more plausibly assignable to Heinrich Eggestein. Besides the studies by Piccard and Gerardy, Schmidt-Künsemüller was vaguely aware (p. 81) that "der Amerikaner Allan Stephenson" had also announced that the Missale speciale could not have been printed before 1460(!). 59 Schmidt-Künsemüller p. 80: "Nur die absolute Übereinstimmung der Eigentümlichkeiten des Wasserzeichens . . . kann zu einer exakteren Datierung verhelfen, und auch dann ist immer noch mit einer zeitlichen Spanne zu rechnen, die gewiss grösser ist, als die Wasserzeichenforscher wahrhaben wollen." 60 Ibid., p. 82: "Das Rätsel um das M. Sp. ist also nach wie vor ungelöst . . . So bleibt schliesslich, wie so oft in der Gutenberg-Forschung, nur die Hoffnung auf einen neuen archivalischen Fund, der allein wohl das Rätsel endgültig lösen kann." I am not, by the way, aware of any case where an "archival find" has sufficed to solve a chronological problem of early typography. 61 The waste, with visible date "Anno lxxiij", was reproduced by Wilhelm-Jos. Meyer, Catalogue des incunables de la Bibliothèque cantonale et universitaire de Fribourg ( Suisse ) (Fribourg, 1917), pl. [7b]; and discussed by Gustav Binz, "Die Anfänge des Buchdrucks in Basel," in Gutenberg-Festschrift (Mainz, 1925), 385-397 at p. 390. Unfortunately, the Morgan copy at some unspecified later stage but probably while in the Morgan Library underwent binding repairs and replacement of endleaves, and no such waste can now be found. 62 See Paul Geissler, "Ein viertes Exemplar des Missale speciale in der Staats- und Stadtbibliothek Augsburg," Gutenberg-Jahrbuch 1962 , 86-93. 63 Curt F. Bühler, "The Missale speciale and the Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary," PBSA 66 no. 1 (1st Quarter 1972), 1-11. 64 Curt F. Bühler "Last Words on Watermarks," PBSA 67 no. 1 (1st Quarter 1973), 1-16. This was the one scholarly question that disturbed Bühler's equanimity. He accused Stevenson of making "a few, curiously discourteous, innuendoes" about his 1957 study, "Watermarks and the Dates of Fifteenth-Century Books" (cited note 50 above). This is not true; Stevenson was restrained but accurate in his comments on a study which, as he surely saw, entirely missed the mark. Perhaps his most open comment ( Problem of the Missale speciale , p. 61) was that "Dr. Bühler speaks of 'the same paper' with no clear intimation of what he means by it." But in this Stevenson was simply right—Bühler's 1973 article further confirms this—and if plain speaking is to be accounted a fault, how are we to judge Greg and Bowers? 65 The classic study of this phenomenon, but confined only to Italian examples, is Rudolf Juchhoff, "Das Fortleben mittelalterlicher Schreibgewohnheiten in den Druckschriften des 15. Jahrhunderts," Beiträge zur Inkunabelkunde , neue Folge, 1 (1935): 65-77; reprinted in his Kleine Schriften (Bonn, 1973): 17-34. 66 Stevenson's lectures were published in 1991 as "The Problem of the Blockbooks," based on a typescript which he left at the Stadsbibliotheek, Haarlem. It must be emphasized that these lectures are not at all in a state that Stevenson himself would have considered worthy of publication. Moreover, the text is in many places corrupt. Some years ago, Rachel Stevenson gave me a photocopy of the lectures which includes substantial corrections and additions in Stevenson's hand. A preliminary comparison of the two texts suggests that the published text could be corrected in many points from this photocopy. At various places, however, the texts show very different phraseologies, and it is not immediately apparent which represents the later intention. Stevenson published also a brief summary of his lectures as "The Quincentennial of Netherlandish Blockbooks" (1966), with beta-radiographic reproductions of three paper stocks. 67 In particular, the recent descriptions of the Bibliothèque Nationale's great collection of blockbooks by Ursula Baurmeister may be called Stevensonian ( Bibliothèque Nationale: Catalogue des incunables ( CIBN ). Tome I, fasc. 1: Xylographes et A. Paris: Bibliothèque Nationale, 1992). 68 In published form, his work on Caxton was confined to scattered remarks and to a brief mimeographed handout accompanying a small exhibition at the British Museum in 1967: "Caxton and the Unicorns." 69 "Tudor Roses from John Tate," 1967. 70 "The First Book Printed at Louvain," 1970. I have criticized elsewhere the specifics of this study (yet tentatively accepted its conclusion): see "Caxton in Cologne," in Ars impressoria . . . Festgabe für Severin Corsten (Munich, 1986), 103-131, at pp. 123-126. 71 A very different but related monograph was produced by Gerhard Piccard for a shorter period and more restricted place: "Papiererzeugung und Buchdruck in Basel bis zum Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts," Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens 8 (1966), cols. 25-322. Piccard stated there, in passing, that his census of dated documentary uses of the Missal papers during the period 1472-1476 had considerably grown, but without, unfortunately, giving details. 72 See particularly the reviews by G. Thomas Tanselle in Library Quarterly 39 (1969), 201-202; and by George D. Painter in The Book Collector (1969), 95-102: "This is a great book from a great scholar, who will be named, with McKerrow, Greg, Masson, Bowers, among the masters and innovators of analytical bibliography." 73 "Shakespearian Dated Watermarks," (1952), p. 159; cf. also note 3, ibid.: "Lest there be a later question of Russian or American priority, I state clearly that the day was 10 July 1950 and the hour 10 A.M. I had played in the National Lawn Bowling Tournament at Los Angeles the previous week." 74 "Paper as Bibliographical Evidence" (1962), pp. 207-210.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Editing Paintings/Conserving Literature: The Nature of the 'Work' by Paul Eggert *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Critical editing has often been justified, if sometimes complacently, by its parallel with the restoration of discoloured and damaged paintings. But the complacency is easily pricked by a conundrum editors are fond of quoting: if the Mona Lisa is in the Louvre, where is Hamlet ? The question teases the listener into thought about the existential status of the literary as opposed to the plastic arts—of the basically different relationships of the 'work', in each case, to the physical object. 1 The present essay examines some of the practices and assumptions of modern art conservation for the—often refractory—light they throw on traditional editorial beliefs about the boundaries and constitution of the literary work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Among the most important pieces of art restoration in progress at the moment is the work on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Time has wreaked remarkably little havoc since the fifteenth century. Ceiling leaks, candle smoke, and the wine, animal glue, arabic resin and other substances used in the many earlier restorations dating from the sixteenth century are nearly all being removed. The dark and gloomy surface which suffocated the range of Michelangelo's tonality and fed the nineteenth-century myth of his being a black and melancholy artist is being stripped away. Dott. Colalucci, the Senior Restorer, has argued the 'necessity to recover all full chromatic effects intended by Michelangelo . . . without which [the fresco] would appear flat and without modelling'. 2 The aim is a total cleaning. One of the discoveries has been a piece of the original fresco which in 1517 was used to fill a crack which had already developed in the ceiling. The colours of this fragment, which had suffered only a few years of exposure, are extremely close to the colours emerging from the restoration process. Relatively little retouching has been found necessary, and that has been done in watercolour, thus making it easily reversible by later generations of restorers. One result of this ambitious restoration—spanning nine years—is new knowledge about Michelangelo's working methods. In order to make decisions about methods of restoration, the restorers have had to reconstruct how Michelangelo actually went about his work. The surface of the paintings and the subsurface have had to be investigated thoroughly. Very little evidence of co-workers has been found; the ceiling was not therefore a workshop production. Michelangelo painted up to eighteen square feet per day. Painting a fresco , he had to work while the surface was still damp: it has been calculated that he did the whole ceiling in about 450 stints or giornate , each of up to a day in length. An interesting parallel with bibliography emerges. The painting, we learn, has had to be analysed not just as image, for its iconic value and historical interrelatedness to the traditions of the period. It has had to be known, in the words of the title of a recent Australian conference of restorers and curators, as an 'articulate surface'. Restorers (or 'conservators' as they prefer to be called) and curators nowadays have available to them a battery of tests: X-radiographs which seek evidence of pentimenti (revisions) or earlier versions beneath the surface, the use of raking, ultra-violet and infra-red light, the microanalysis of cross-sections of paint, and the many other techniques of chemical identification. The building-up of the layers of paint from the 'ground' coating can be examined. These methods could be said to correspond to the collations and the methods of analytical bibliography employed by editors; and descriptive bibliographies could be paralleled to catalogues raisonnés . Indeed, if curators and conservators are archaeologists of the image—if they can make the surface articulate the painting's history—then editors are archaeologists of the printed or written text, of the history of its writing and production. But in both cases it has traditionally been felt that the primary upshot of this considerable effort is to present to the viewing or reading public a restored painting or a reading text of the literary work—the real thing, or as close to it as we can get. Just as, it is believed, accumulations of dirt and varnish can be removed to reveal the painting as it left the artist's hand, so ought editors to aim at recovering the text which the author (however one construes the term) intended. Through the glass darkly, we can—with conservators' and editors' help—espy, if not know in all its details, the thing itself: the work of literary or painterly art. However, the following consideration of the activity of art-making—and the traces it leaves behind for the conservators to deal with—does not support the traditional assumption. This conclusion might be of only tangential interest for literary editors were it not that the evidence from painting conservation dovetails in some important respects with that provided by editors' examination of the traces of literary production. If the line of observation and argument in this essay is persuasive, then there are implications for editors' understanding of their practice because of the unavoidable questioning of the traditional term, 'literary work'. Rather than a robust existential entity, it emerges as a creature of our own conventions. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II As a professional activity, art conservation has emerged only since the Second World War, but in recent years a critical assessment of the theoretical bases of the activity has been in train. This is evident in the papers given by conservators and curators at recent conferences in Ottawa, London and Canberra. 4 Assumptions about the boundaries of the work of art are being contested—as are the roles which the viewing audience and the exhibition context should have in the definition of the work. Even the case of the Sistine Chapel—which might have been custommade to illustrate the traditional view—has its refractory elements. Minor retouchings from previous restorations are being removed. Dott. Colalucci refers to them as 'unartistic'. But some additions done in 1565 as a result of the Council of Trent's finding the nudity in the painting disgusting are being retained, despite the fact that their removal would be a simple matter. Daniele da Volterra painted some small pieces of clothing over the offending portions. A copy in Naples shows how the painting originally looked in this respect. This, incidentally, is a familiar paradox to conservators: that because of more favourable conditions of hanging or storage, the use by the copyist of superior materials, or a botched restoration of the original, a copy can be closer in some respects to the earlier state of the painting than is the painting itself. 5 But while the copy may repeat faithfully the original image and still approximate its original colours, its surface and subsurface will almost certainly not correspond. They will articulate a different process of production, a different conjunction of historical factors. The decision, in the case of the Sistine Chapel, to retain what critical editors might think of as the Council of Trent's bowdlerisation is being done on the grounds of their historical value, despite the fact that the justification of the entire restoration is based on appeals either to Michelangelo's intention or to the recovery of the original state of the frescoes. This does not seem a consistent application of a principle, if the principle is authorial. If the principle is historical, then it is running together two historical moments within a third: the moment of late-twentieth-century restoration. The effects of time on the painting are not being eliminated; they are being packaged in a superb, though somewhat contradictory, act of artistic editing—an act that is happening in the present. Although there has been a long history of failed restorations of the Sistine Chapel and although Dott. Colalucci envisages the need for successors, the rationale of his team's activities is backward-directed. Yet clearly their restoration, which is an intervention of the most radical kind, eliminates the evidence on which generations of viewings and interpretations of the ceiling have been based. Essentially it refuses to acknowledge the role of the viewer or of time in the work of art. Instead, its authenticity as an act of painterly editing derives, or claims to derive, from Michelangelo—mostly, but with a little bit from the Council of Trent. The shuffle is interesting, acknowledging as it does a contemporary synthesis—an appeal to conventions in the present—while the rhetoric of the justification is an appeal to the past and to authorship (interestingly, curators use this latter term). In other words, the painting in the Sistine Chapel is an ongoing work which continues in the activities of Dott. Colalucci and his team. The conclusion that the Sistine Chapel painting is an ongoing work may be felt provocative—or, at best, teasingly paradoxical. We normally prefer to think of the work and the conservation (or editing) as two separate things: the latter, we believe, is brought to bear on the former. The work is the quarry which, in all its details, the conservator and editor seek out. Such is Dott. Colalucci's aim, and we might assume it to be widely applicable. Leonardo's Last Supper (1498) is, however, an immediate exception. Due to failures of adhesion, there have been extensive losses of pigment and priming across the whole surface. 6 Leonardo's work exists now only in fragments; the current restoration being undertaken by Pinin Brambilla Barcilon is intended to strip off the successive overpaintings to recover what remains of Leonardo's own work. Martin Kemp remarks that the resultant emphasis on 'the ravishing detail that will reveal the hand of the master' (p. 18) is often justified by close-up before-and-after photographs. The conservators' work is aimed at facilitating a form of reading the painting quite foreign to earlier generations of viewers and restorers, many of whom looked at it as a history painting and all of whom, according to Kemp, looked for the overall effect rather than to the fragment. In other words, modern conservational technology, justified by a rhetoric of authorial intent and authenticity, is re-presenting a Last Supper that is very much a product of the present. There can, therefore, be no 'real' Last Supper unrelated to the conservator. Kemp is quietly persuasive on the point: I am not someone who believes that the artist's intentions are either imponderable or irrelevant to the historian who wishes to understand the work and, by extension, to any spectator who wishes to enrich the potential of their viewing. In Leonardo's case we are fortunate in possessing a large body of notes to help us identify his 'intentions'—in the most obvious sense of this term. . . . [But any] artist's intentions, and most especially during the deeply pondered and protracted execution of a work like the 'Last Supper', will be a complex and shifting compound of conscious and unconscious aspirations, adjustments, re-definitions, acts of chance and evasions. It is unlikely that there ever was a stable set of transparently accessible intentions. . . . Any programme of restoration of a badly damaged and extensively repaired artifact which aims to reinstate some measure of the original experience has to make an implicit choice as to which of the artist's intentions or groups of intentions and which of the various spectators' criteria are to be satisfied. (p. 18) The case of the Leonardo painting raises the question of how far the search for authorial traces should go. In the collection of the New South Wales State Library there is a painting of an important colonial figure, Elizabeth Macarthur, by an anonymous journeyman painter. Dating from about 1840, it had been overpainted in the Victorian period. Conservators removed the overpainting, thereby revealing a Regency-style bust but destroying a Victorian painting. The 'original' was uncovered, and it has welcome historical value; but the later work must also have had some which is now lost. Again, there is a large painting by Benjamin West from the 1790s, called Christ Showing the Little Children ; it is in the Foundlings Hospital, London. It was subject to very early deterioration. West repainted it after ten years, and fifteen years later had once again to restore it. There are, thus, three versions of the work painted one on top of the other. All are authorial. Would there be grounds to remove one or both of the top layers? This would involve their destruction, but would reveal the original. Put another way: are there grounds, other than economic ones, not to remove the top layers? Whichever way one answers the question, the need for the conservator and curator to assume an actively interpretative role is inescapable. 7 Conservators then, rather like editors, do not occupy a neutral, ideologically innocent position that is legitimised by their scientific techniques. Post-structuralist theorists have repeatedly argued that we participate in what we know and that power inheres in the ways that we know. The application of this now-familiar argument is clear. Editors and conservators are not simply engaged in other-directed action. The artistic (or literary) work is not an object which of itself necessitates certain criteria in the restorative activity. One such criterion, authorial intention, is, according to Martin Kemp, too slippery a notion to be of use without redefinition in a way that deprives it of its capacity to encompass the wholeness or integrity of the work. Nevertheless, authorial agency remains of prime interest to most viewers and readers, and this factor can offer a justification for certain forms of editorial treatment of visual and printed artifacts where, at the local level, distinctions can often be made between traces that are probably authorial and those that are not. This justification is pragmatic rather than idealist: conservators and editors are interventionists, go-betweens, rather than scientifically disinterested technicians. In and through their activities, literary and artistic works continue to function—and function differently from before: editors and conservators broker workable solutions between documents and new readers, between artifact and new generations of viewers, on the basis of criteria which enjoy a currency and persuasive power in their day. Where this leaves the traditional editorial notion of the work (whose authorial text editors characteristically aim to isolate from the similar but variant texts produced by differently motivated copyists, printers and commercial publishers) is a question the remaining illustrations may help to clarify.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Here is Hogarth on the problem of change in the life of a painting: let us now see in what manner time operates on the colours themselves; in order to discover if any changes in them can give a picture more union and harmony than has been in the power of a skilful Master, with all his rules of art, to do. When colours change at all, it must be somewhat in the manner following, for as they are made some of metal, some of earth, some of stone, and others of more perishable materials, time cannot operate on them otherwise than as by daily experience we find it doth, which is, that one changes darker, another lighter, one quite to a different colour, whilst another, as ultramarine, will keep its natural brightness. . . . Therefore how is it possible that such different materials, ever variously changing . . . should accidentally coincide with the artist's intention. 8 Compare this with a more recent statement by John Brealey: You must be aware, for instance, that the contrast between the lights and darks has often been parodied by time because the darks have darkened but the lights have not changed to the same extent and so the distance between them has become a grotesque caricature of their original relationship. The half tones where all the subtlety of expression lies, have become closer to the lights than to the shadows. . . . If you are going to do the right thing by the artist, you have to consider how, through the removal of oxidised layers of varnish, it is possible to bring back some semblance of the picture's original cohesion. 9 Both Hogarth and Brealey defer to the artist's intention, yet both recognise that its recuperation is likely to be impossible. The unavoidable conclusion is that total cleaning of a painting usually cannot restore the painting as it left the artist's hands even when it is completely intact. All it can do is reveal the present state of the paint beneath the grime. Thus, rightly to appreciate as viewers what we see in front of us at the art gallery, we have to recognise the agency of time in the life of artistic works and to appreciate the limitations which the passage of time imposes on the 'editing' of paintings. The viewer needs to know whether the painting has been totally cleaned, partially cleaned (this is where 'the surface of the original paint is not revealed, but remains covered by a thin layer of varnish' [Hedley, p. 163]), or, thirdly, nuance-cleaned (where differential amounts of cleaning are done in order to 'restore the relationship of values that, it is believed, would have existed in the original' [Hedley, p. 164]). Obviously both partial and nuance cleaning involve critical and aesthetic choices. Partial cleaning seeks to maintain the harmonising function of the first thin yellow layer of varnish and acknowledges its cultural function as a signifier of 'the age, the antique character' of the artifact (Hedley, p. 163). Nuance cleaning stresses the recovery—although it is, unavoidably, the renewed creation—of balance and unity in the painting. Gerry Hedley, whose paper I have been quoting, stresses that where the original painting has undergone significant change (and scarcely any painting survives a century without physical damage) the artist's intention will not be recoverable in full. The best that can be done by the conservator, he argues, is the institution of 'newfound relativities to that intention and to time' (p. 164). The artist's agency was indispensable; but, as far as the work is concerned, that is not the end of the matter. The 'mortal body' of the painting, as one conservator calls it, 10 is always in a state of physical change; and at crucial moments in its history it is, as it were, partially rewritten—re-published in a revised form—by its editor-conservators. Whatever approach is adopted the fundamental artifact is changed, taking on new meanings. If artists are still alive when their work deteriorates then they may, like Benjamin West, act as their own conservators. Taking on this role creates new twists in the definition of the artistic work akin to those created for the literary work by the writer's returning for revision when, some years after publication, a second edition is called for. Take the case of Liz Magor, a well known artist-sculptor in Toronto who acknowledges the influence on her of Walter Benjamin's essay, 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'. For Magor and many other artists in the 1970s the phenomenon of mechanical reproducibility tended to undermine commitment to the individual creation of the unique art-object in favour of transformation of preexisting cultural artifacts. Hence her description of one of her works, Time and Mrs Tiber (1976), which the National Gallery of Canada purchased in 1977: When Time and Mrs Tiber was purchased, we all knew—the curator, the conservators and myself—that it was unstable and subject to slow deterioration. In fact, death, decay, and entropy constitute both the physical and intellectual content of the work—the form being several dozen canning jars filled with various vegetable substances [placed in an old-fashioned kitchen dresser]. These provisions had been put up by a West Coast homesteader in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and it was my intention to honour and preserve the evidence of Mrs. Tiber's rescue of the crop of 1948. 11 Magor says she thinks of 'the life of a work as correlated to my own' (p. 11), but the Gallery (or 'museum', as those in the trade prefer to call them) had longer-term ideas. So when in 1987 three jars were found to contain botulism she suggested that she simply replace them, and she was fortified by the fact that the three had not been among those put up by Mrs Tiber but ones which she had originally prepared herself so that the dresser's shelves would be completely filled. This time she got assistance from an experienced hand at preserves, Mrs Coburn. Another of her works, Dorothy: A Resemblance (1980-81), in the same gallery, consists of four tables, each covered with small objects cast in lead: bottles, pears, slices of bread, books, small loaves, etc. Each object had been cast in moulds which she had made herself, but in rather primitive circumstances: the pears had been produced from one mould, the loaves from another, and so on. Trouble started when light fingers made off with some of the temptingly pocket-sized items on the tables. The Gallery contracted another artist to make new moulds from remaining examples on the table and so to cast replacements. However the replacements turned out to be not exactly the same as the objects the moulds were made from because of the superior equipment and technique which the contractor made use of. Magor's chagrin is evident: 'In spite of the fact that it is a piece made up of many parts, it was [originally] forged as a whole, and any replacement is unable to be part of that moment' (p. 10). Magor's problem is the problem of all conservation, just as the problem of the author's revision is the problem of all editing: the later activity (assuming its presence is established) is unable to be part of the original moment, whether or not undertaken by the same person. Hershel Parker has demonstrated the problems for editors who would attempt to conjoin in a single reading text the results of radically separate acts of composition or revision; and many of us must have questioned the wisdom, even as they marvelled at the execution, of editions such as the Clarendon Tess of the D'Urbervilles which incorporates into the manuscript base-text some revisions made by Hardy more than twenty years after his original writing. 12 This raises the question of textual authority: the right of the author to go on controlling the work's meanings. Editors have traditionally respected the author's right to do that. And the Canadian Art Gallery, in consulting Liz Magor about conservation, was doing much the same thing. But in both cases we are likely to confuse documentary ownership with textual authority. Having sold her pieces—her physical documents, as one may say—Magor no longer owned them. That is uncontentious, but one can go further: although she thinks of the life of her work as correlated to her own, its life goes on predominantly in the viewing and thinking of other people, including the Gallery's conservators. Over these readings—these 'textual' activities—she has little control and no authority. Magor's statements of her intentions and the contexts of those intentions in her life and other work will and should influence those textual activities: but only as part of viewers' efforts to understand and contextualise and conserve. Whether she should have the right to reconfigure or replace aspects of the physical artifacts is moot: she is acting as a conservator rather than artist if she does so. The original moment cannot be recalled, as Claes Oldenburg also found when he replaced the pickle on top of his four-and-a-half feet Giant Hamburger of 1962. The piece is made of sailcloth, foam rubber and newspaper; the original pickle had been destroyed, but Oldenburg had offered to replace it for exhibition in 1967 in Ottawa. He made it in New York, and flew up with it to Ottawa, using it as a comfortable headrest on the way. When it was inspected at the Gallery, the paintwork was found to be significantly different to the original and more characteristic of his recent 1967 work than his earlier technique. 13 Both examples show that the personal and historical locatedness of a work is unavoidable and unreproducible even in works which, in their apparent mechanical reproducibility, embody their creator's rejection of the notion of the unique and inspired work of art.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The moral is straightforward and surprising: whether they date from the twentieth century or the sixteenth, the artifactual remains become, at the moment of treatment, the site of conservatorial participation rather than the object of restoration. In the case of paintings the surface is partially re-made in a diachronic collaboration between artist and conservator which issues in a changed artifact. Conservatorial treatment, then, participates in the ongoing life of the work; and if the two coalesce for a time, they should not be thought of as completely discrete categories. If in addition, as suggested above in relation to Liz Magor, the viewer also plays a role in the work of art—at the level of textual rather than documentary activity—then a notion of the work as participatory begins to emerge. One is immediately led to reconsider traditional conceptions of the work. The usual assumption has been that the viewer plays no role in the painting but only reacts to it. Put another way, the viewer may look at it, but is not part of it. However, this common-sensical appeal to the normal experience of museum art ignores not only the specialised viewing of the conservator at the point of treatment but also the historical fact that the very question of what constitutes a work of art rests squarely within the province of the viewer, including expert viewers. Take the case of J. M. W. Turner's paintings. When he died in 1851 he left his paintings to the British nation. This led to a legal battle about which of his works were finished paintings—'finished' being the term he used in the final form of his will. An inventory taken by the Keeper of the National Gallery in 1859 states that there were 100 finished pictures, 182 unfinished and many thousands of drawings and sketches. 'The wish expressed in the will was fairly strictly observed'; 14 the remainder were consigned to the vault of the National Gallery, uncatalogued, and did not appear in the first catalogue raisonné of Turner's works which appeared in 1902. But by the end of the nineteenth century, the definition of what was considered to be a Turner painting in the full sense was changing, influenced by the new taste for Impressionism and by a nationalist desire to compare late Turner favourably against the French Impressionists. Thus influenced, in the first decade of this century over seventy Turners from the vault were formally accessioned, including such famous ones as Norham Castle, Sunrise and Interior at Petworth . What are now considered towering masterpieces were not considered by Turner or by the National Gallery in the mid-nineteenth century to be works of art suitable for exhibition. With the benefit of Impressionism, curators and the viewing public decided otherwise. With the paintings transferred to the Tate Gallery, the process of accessioning continued, until by 1944 all of his unfinished paintings and his thousands of sketches—almost whatever his hands had touched—had been accepted. The sense in which a work of art is completed only in its viewing, and the contexts of that viewing, was clarified at the Canberra conference by a paper given by Christopher Saines who discussed the Queensland Art Gallery's Resurrection (?1560s) by Tintoretto, then on loan to the Australian National Gallery for its Rubens and the Italian Renaissance exhibition (1992). That exhibition was very consciously contextual in its educational strategy, aiming to demonstrate connections and influences over a couple of centuries. The finished painting in question has its own fascinating context within Tintoretto's œuvre and within the micro-history of its own production. Tintoretto did seven paintings of the Resurrection, and there are a further four workshop examples extant. The same studio prop, a large box representing Christ's tomb, appears in many of them. Analysis of the subsurface of this particular Resurrection has revealed that the composition was worked up on the canvas. In the course of the painting, Tintoretto must have realised that the theatricality of the Resurrection would be heightened if he brought the tomb to the very front of the picture plane, thus having the arising Christ appear to step right out of it into the viewer's space. Perspectivally, the painting was intended to be seen high, as on a church altar, and one would have had to get down on the floor of the gallery to get anything like the originally intended effect. In other words, Tintoretto factored the viewer's position into his painting; he certainly never intended it to be hung in the Queensland and Australian National Art Galleries at eye-level. 15 A painting's size in relation to the viewer's size is important; indeed, trompe l'oeil effects depend on one's physical body and its expectations about space. One's engagement with a painting, that is to say, is not only intellectual, aesthetic and emotional: it is physical as well. Knowledge of it is partly corporeal. A work of art with a still unfolding mission, it comes into being with each new viewing. This is not to say that one's standing in front of it affects the artifact, except in microscopic ways. But, as a physical object, the painting is important—is a work of art—only in so far as it allows these personal encounters to keep on happening. The necessary distinction here is between the painting as physical object (manifesting the agencies of artist, time and conservator) and as meaningful text (the agencies of viewers). The distinction, if accepted, has notable consequences. One is the provision of an answer to the iconoclastic argument that a work of art by a master which is subsequently exposed as a forgery has not in itself changed at all. Therefore, the argument goes, the notion of authenticity is a sham, and reverence of work 'by the hand of the artist' is a plot by auctioneers to keep up the market prices. However, this argument runs together the painting's existence as artifact with its capacity to produce meaning for the viewer. The latter existence (what I am calling 'text') feeds from contexts of understanding, including historical ones, in one's engagement with the painting. These contexts are ineradicably altered by the revealing of the forgery: as a viewer of the forgery one had 'got it wrong'; one has to try again. The second consequence is that, in the case of the literary work, 'text' (defined as before) requires the reader's involvement in raising meaning from what is ink on the page (i.e. 'document'). If seen as a combination of 'document' and 'text', works of literary (or painterly) art cannot be thought of as stable, or stabilisable, things. They function only in time and are never completed unless they become entirely ignored; and they have no unchanging existential anchor—whether in the author or in the historical moment of their creation or reading. Always subject to the processes of authorial reworking and revision prior to their publication or exhibition, they enter into a different kind of process in their public life. 16 This line of argument is about the functioning of artistic and literary works. Concentrating on art as a phenomenon in a constant state of change offers an alternative view of the literary work to the traditional one as an abstraction hovering behind the extant documents (and, as is often said, 'witnessed' by them). Granted, our pragmatic agreements and conventions create the expectation that the work exists in its own right, statically and in isolate singularity. But the evidence suggests a constant state of textual activity on the part of creators, editor-conservators and reader-viewers. All are involved in the work: this is why conservation and scholarly editing must be understood as interpretative rather than scientific or technical activities. Some of this activity results in the alteration of the documents, the artifacts, from which future readings, future textual work, will be done by readers. Editors painstakingly re-configure and re-present a documentary form of the literary work; conservators must alter, even partially destroy, the artifact itself. This last distinction between the dealings of editors and conservators with their artifactual materials might be thought to undo the line of argument about the work as participatory. However the distinction is not quite as it first appears. In part because of the persuasiveness of the editor's textual argument and in part because of the prestige of the press, the series, even at its crassest the amount of public moneys consumed in its preparation and publication, a new critical edition tends at least temporarily to eclipse other editions of the work—just as the newly conserved artistic artifact eclipses the old. Nevertheless, the significant difference remains that the pre-existing literary documents, unlike artistic artifacts, remain available for other editors to work on. In theory, if rarely in practice, multiple critical editions of the same work could be in circulation at any one time. Even if their editors agreed in their essential aim—the establishment of the text of final authorial intention—the editions would in practice be different in many details: the determining of intention is necessarily an interpretative matter, as is the postulation of readings from lost documentary states; and the deciphering of a difficult holograph depends on experience and skill. The various editors would be aiming, as it were, to release the text of the work from the documentary detritus accumulated in successive copyings and printings over the decades or centuries, to have the previously obscured text of the author's communication emerge as clearly as possible, to make their elusive textual quarry available in a reliable form for the first time. If editing has had an allure, this surely has been it. Thus would the 'work' be figured, in actual editorial practice, as something over and apart from the editors and their activities even if (and to some extent because) no one of the editors will have perfectly achieved his or her aim. But what might not be clear to these various like-minded editors is that, as the comparison with paintings shows, they would be not so much 'releasing' the work as—rather like the conservators, though without dire effects on the existing artifacts—participating in its ongoing life, constituting its functioning, for the time being in an influential way. I am entertaining, then, a phenomenological view of the work. Under this approach, principled disagreements about the modes in which editorial and conservatorial interventions should take place would remain as important as ever. But the view enforces the realisation that we would be disagreeing about our conventions for understanding the work, not something inherent in it—for there is no it , as work of art, independent of our understandings. On the other side of the coin, those efforts of understanding have an obligation to deal with what the physical artifacts, the documents, mutely testify to—and the documents, as documents, persist essentially independent of our understandings. In other words, our textual and editorial activity should be linked to, and seek to understand and contextualise, prior documentary activity: oral transmission aside, that is the basis of our access to the past. Accordingly a phenomenological view would abandon any belief in the work as an ideal thing and instead acknowledge (for possible bibliographical analysis) the existence of documents from the past, what people have done with them in the composition, production and reading of them, and the historical locatedness of those acts. In that terrain editing would make its home. Its services would be found just as necessary, but it would figure itself differently from before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This is a revised version of a paper given at the A. E. Housman Centenary Seminar, Monash University, Melbourne, 3 October 1992. I thank the readers of the paper for SB for their comments and suggestions. 1 For a recent, clarifying discussion of the differences, see G. Thomas Tanselle, A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989). The present essay benefits from that discussion but reaches different conclusions (see note 3 and the last pages). 2 From personal notes made at a lecture given by Dott. Colalucci at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 3 May 1992. The Chapel was built in the 1480s, and the frescoes were painted 1508-12. 3 In his recent work, G. Thomas Tanselle seems to clear away many misconceptions associated with the traditional assumption of the singularity of the literary work (including allowing it multiple textual forms) only to reinstall something very like it. In A Rationale , he develops the traditional distinction between document and text by distinguishing between the texts of documents and the texts of works. He acknowledges disagreements about the source of a literary work—about the kinds of authorship editors nowadays subscribe to: whether as the expression of an individual; the collaborative expression of a publisher, printer and author; or just the impersonal expression of the language at a particular historical moment. He therefore allows that there can be several critically edited texts of a work. But—paradoxically—he also seems to see the work as essentially singular, whatever the editors' orientations about its source: intelligent readers of a printed or other document, he observes, seek the text of 'the work that lies behind' it (p. 18). Elsewhere, he gives the work an ideal (and again singular) status: it 'speaks to us across the generations' but 'will forever be a conjecture arising from those time-bound, vulnerable objects', the written and printed documents ('Textual Criticism and Deconstruction', Studies in Bibliography , 43 [1990], 1-33 [p. 22]). See also note 16, below. It should be possible to write a history of the concept of the 'work'. It would inevitably be interlinked with the history of the technology of the book and of the concept of authorship (and of the allied concepts of copyright, forgery and piracy). For copyright, see my 'Document and Text: The "Life" of the Literary Work and the Capacities of Editing', forth-coming in Text , vol. 7. 4 The conferences were: Ottawa, October 1989, Shared Responsibility: A Seminar for Curators and Conservators (proceedings edited by Barbara A. Ramsay-Joliceur and Ian N. M. Wainwright: Ottawa: National Gallery of Canada, 1990); London, June 1990, Appearance, Opinion, Change: Evaluating the Look of Paintings (proceedings edited by Peter Booth et al.: London: United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, 1990); and Canberra, May 1992, The Articulate Surface: Dialogues on Paintings between Conservators, Curators and Art Historians (examples of conservations referred to without citation derive from these papers, so far unpublished). 5 E.g. the copy by a Miss Manton in 1874 of Petrus von Schendel's Poultry Vendor (1865) which was badly restored by chemists of the Victorian Railways, Melbourne. Both are in the National Gallery of Victoria collection. Copying was not only a training technique for students throughout the nineteenth century, it was recognised as a form of art in itself. Copies of Old Masters were respectable acquirements amongst the rich Australian farmers: they were tangible tokens of their owner's taste. When the collection was being formed in the late nineteenth century, in those days before colour photography, it was a real question, discussed in the newspapers of the day, whether copies of European masterpieces should be preferred over the collection of less culturally impressive originals. In the end, the latter view prevailed. 6 Martin Kemp, 'Looking at Leonardo's Last Supper', in Appearance, Opinion, Change , pp. 14-22. 7 There is a painting by Vincent van Gogh in the Fogg Art Museum, Boston, Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin (1888). Van Gogh sent it as a gift to Gauguin who made some alterations to it, not very expertly: 'In this case, preserving acquired historical significance was preferred to returning the work closer to its original aesthetic significance' (Ian S. Hodkinson, 'Man's Effects on Paintings', in Shared Responsibility , p. 67). The decision could easily have gone the other way. 8 William Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty , ed. J. Burke (1955), quoted in Gerry Hedley, 'Long Lost Relations and New Found Relativities: Issues in the Cleaning of Paintings', in Shared Responsibility , p. 160. 9 From J. Hill Stoner, 'John Brealey's Trained and Sympathetic Eye', Museum News , 59, no. 7 (1981), p. 26. Quoted in Hedley, 'Long Lost Relations', p. 163. Hedley goes on: 'Paintings on dark grounds are the most prone to show very dark and very light contrasting regions. The intensity of the shadows and half-tones increases as medium darkens; and the paint becomes more transparent, so the influence of the dark ground is greater' (p. 166). 10 Stefan Michalski distinguishes between the physical attributes of paintings and the non-physical which reside in 'the thing as a whole': 'their creator, their history, their composition, imagery, symbolism, etc., even their market value' ('Time's Effects on Paintings' in Shared Responsibility , pp. 39-53 [p. 40]). Ian S. Hodkinson concurs: 'paintings are in a continual state of physical and metaphysical flux which changes their significance to the particular society that is interacting with them at any given moment in their history' ('Man's Effects on Paintings', in Shared Responsibility , p. 59). 11 Liz Magor, 'An Artist's Thoughts on Conservation and Curatorial Issues' in Shared Responsibilities , pp. 6-11 (p. 6). For Benjamin's essay, see his Illuminations , ed. Hannah Arendt, trans. Harry Zohn (1969). 12 Ed. Juliet Grindle and Simon Gattrell (1983). Parker, Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons (1984). 13 See Brydon Smith, 'Shared Responsibility: Welcome and Introduction', in Shared Responsibility , pp. 1-5. 14 Will Vaughan, 'Hanging Fragments: The Case of Turner's Oeuvre', in Appearance, Opinion, Change , pp. 85-91 (p. 85). 15 The painting has grown away from him also in other ways: through water damage, through being cropped at one stage, and through the normal deterioration associated with aging. 16 Cf. Tanselle's recent advice that 'we must keep in mind the fundamental fact that the artifacts we work with [as readers and editors] cannot be the works themselves and thus that we must constantly distinguish the texts of documents from the texts of works' ('The Varieties of Scholarly Editing' in Scholarly Editing: A Research Guide , New York: MLA, 1994). The term 'texts', though used here in good faith, allows a nearly invisible slippage in the argument. 'Text' can be (and, as I have argued, on occasions needs to be) firmly distinguished from 'document'. The document is a physical object bearing traces of textual activity of author or compositor but is textually inert until a reader raises—essentially creates—text from what, inherently, is only ink on paper. (I do not argue the reader-response position that the reader creates the text in the full sense, for this leaves out the indispensable role of the document and the prior activity it testifies to.) Therefore to use the phrase as we all do out of convenience, 'the text of the document', is to run together two distinguishable elements: the physical object and the textual activity of the reader. A problem arises if the conflation is extended to the work—as in the phrase 'the text of the work'—when the existence of multiple documents offers no warranty at all for the belief that works exist in single texts if only we could reach them. The formulation leaves out the necessary participation of the reader in the textual activity. For an allied argument that the opportunities and accidents of compositional process in literary works defeat expectations that a single reading ('product') text can adequately represent the work, see my 'Textual Product or Textual Process: Procedures and Assumptions of Critical Editing' in Devils and Angels: Textual Editing and Literary Theory , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">Decorated Initials in the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript by Joel Fredell *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Thornton Manuscript (Lincoln, Dean and Chapter Library, MS 91) occupies an important place in Middle English studies not only for the literary value of its texts. Robert Thornton, a gentry smallholder from the North Riding of Yorkshire, was both scribe and patron, producer and audience for this manuscript. Thornton's remarkably full relationship to the design of his miscellanies (one other, similar collection in Thornton's hand is extant) makes this manuscript of particular interest for the analysis of manuscript design as evidence for assessing the response of a late medieval gentleman to literary texts. 1 One feature of this design is the large number of decorated initials and planned miniatures or initials scattered throughout the first two texts of the Thornton MS: in the Prose Alexander (hereafter PA ) one large initial and nine blank spaces, all of similar (ten- to thirteen-line) size; one hundred and three small (two- to five-line) decorated initials also in the PA ; and eighty-two small decorated initials in the Alliterative Morte Arthur (hereafter AMA ). These initials not only provide evidence that Thornton completed and used the quires containing these two major literary texts as separate booklets. 2 The programs of initials in the PA and the AMA also suggest a decorative hierarchy which attaches particular prestige to these two works in the miscellany as a whole. 3 Two questions complicate our understanding of Thornton's reception of the works he reproduced. First, it has long been assumed that Thornton provided the decorated initials himself. The various programs or degrees of elaboration distinguishing the different texts could then be, at least in part, a measure of the amount of leisure time available to him to complete a project rather than an indicator of his responses to particular texts. However, if certain texts were designed to have a higher percentage of relatively costly professional decoration, we would have a much better indicator of Thornton's ideas of hierarchy among and within his literary texts. Second is the matter of decorative choices. Since he was both scribe and patron for his miscellany we may be sure that Thornton decided on the size, number, placement, and content of initials and/or miniatures. What remains unknown is how much his exemplars influenced these choices. If we had Thornton's exemplars for comparison we could easily judge when Thornton was simply following his exemplar or setting up the design himself in ways richly informative about just what he found important in his texts. Although we do not have that luxury, close analysis of the decoration itself provides strong evidence that Thornton had a particular interest in kingship and used a decorative hierarchy to develop this theme in the opening poems of this miscellany. The physical compilation of the Thornton MS has been thoroughly studied, as have the available facts of Robert Thornton's life. 4 Beyond the gathering structure and the ordering of the texts, however, the manuscript's design has been largely neglected. The decorative program in this manuscript still suffers from the charge of "amateurism" leveled at it in 1914, and repeated faithfully up through Derek Brewer's introduction to the revised edition of the Scolar Press facsimile. 5 Also, the kind of foliate initials and penwork decoration the Thornton MS shares with a multitude of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century English manuscripts has remained largely below the notice of art historians. 6 Provincial manuscripts which do not have a high level of workmanship are generally ignored unless a compelling literary interest, such as the classification of Chaucer MSS for the Manly-Rickert edition, attracts the attention of a scholar with the knowledge of Margaret Rickert. 7 The assessment of the Lincoln Thornton decorated initials as Thornton's own work seems to me to be incorrect for a number of reasons. The most compelling is, quite simply, that there are three distinct styles among the decorated initials, and Thornton is unlikely to have produced more than one of those, if he in fact produced any. Placed side by side these three major styles do not look like the work of the same hand. 8 They involve substantially different penwork techniques, ones which are never varied or combined throughout the many examples of each style. Style one uses widely familiar abstract penwork flourishes and conventionalized toothed and trefoil foliage; 9 style two uses acanthus leaf decoration, flower blossoms, and the more elaborate illumination associated with these elements; 10 style three uses a version of the East Anglian "cabbage leaf" with quantities of animal, human, dragon, and hybrid figures. 11 Each of these styles is very competent as well as internally consistent, the equal of most penwork initials in provincial secular manuscripts in this period. 12 All three styles are much more likely to be the work of three penwork initial specialists than the work of one gentry amateur whose scribal talents are, in the first place, admittedly limited. Other explanations might be that Thornton adopted different styles at different points in his life in response to current manuscript decoration fashions, or that he used exemplars for his texts whose decoration prompted Thornton to imitate various styles. However, the incidence of these initials within the gathering structure far more clearly supports their origin as piecework by professionals. Styles one and two occur throughout the "romance" quires (A-K) of the MS except for quires D-F. Style one also occurs by itself in the "devotional" quires (L-P); no decorated initials are used in the Liber de Diversis Medicinis (Q-R). 13 Style three occurs only in quires D-F, which contain the AMA and the first part of Octavyane . 14 The next initial in Octavyane (105r in quire G) is in style one, which is used for the rest of the initials in quire H and all decorated initials which follow except for two more style two initials. A chart may be helpful for visualizing this distribution: Quires Contents Styles Size and Number A-C PA 1, 2 10-13 lines: 1 initial, 9 spaces 2-5 lines: 103 initials (3 of them style 2) D-F AMA ; begin Octavyane 3 2-4 lines: 82 initials G-K end Octavyane ; "romances" 1, 2 2-6 lines: 24 initials (2 of them style 2) L-P Devotional Works 1 2-7 lines: 39 initials Q-R Liber de Diversis Medicinis None None The best explanation for this pattern is that Thornton jobbed out quires D-F to get the AMA properly illuminated, having the beginning of Octavyane done in the bargain. The remnants of Octavyane and the following quires of romance poems were apparently a later (and a lesser) concern for a distinctive, consistent program of initials for a single text. If Thornton were the sole decorator he is not likely to have switched from style three to style one halfway through Octavyane merely because he started a new quire. Other textual evidence supports this explanation. Angus McIntosh long ago observed that the AMA and The Previte off the Passioune may have come from the same miscellany, basing his conclusions on remnants of Lincolnshire dialect in these texts. 15 Since both texts begin gatherings Thompson (1983, 117) and Keiser (1979, 177-179) speculate that these were the first works Thornton copied for the Lincoln MS. The Previte has an opening initial in style one (179r); the rest of the initials are unfinished. If Thornton were copying these two texts during the same period one would expect him to use the same initial style if he were imposing his own rather than following that of his exemplars. Thornton could, nonetheless, be following his exemplars. A mixture of decorative styles in one manuscript is quite possible, particularly if Thornton's exemplar was a miscellany itself. However, the use of style one initials in a wide variety of texts throughout the Lincoln Thornton MS argues strongly for some stylistic independence from most of his exemplars, at least. If we do accept the notion of Thornton as an amateur decorator dependent on his exemplars for models, what strains credulity the most is the idea that Thornton's exemplar for Octavyane should not only have initials in the same style as does the AMA , but that it changes styles conveniently just where Thornton must start a new quire. Thompson (1983, 118) argues that there was a "time lapse" between copying the AMA and Octavyane . The decoration of Octavyane is clearly independent of any such lapse, and looks far more like the work of two decorators applying their own styles to whatever quires were in hand. If Thornton is responsible for any decoration, the most likely candidate is style one. The switch halfway through Octavyane could then be explained as the result of a decision to save on the expense of a professional decorator or the later unavailability of the style three decorator. However, the attribution leaves us with some problems accounting for the presence of style two initials. Style two appears only rarely and sporadically; since it is the most highly colored style (using black, blue, green and brown to decorate the red initials) it may have been the most expensive. 16 Twice it appears as the opening initial for a romance ( Ysambrace and The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyn , 109r and 154r respectively) in the midst of gatherings which otherwise contain style one initials: the lone internal initial for The Awntyrs , a text entirely contained within quire I, is in style one (158r). Only the PA has internal style two initials; these three initials (19r, 19v, 27r) occur in gatherings in combination with style one, as do all style two initials distributed through the "romance" quires. If Thornton were also capable of producing the more spectacular style two initials, why didn't he use them more often? Whether they are the work of Thornton or a professional, their use as internal initials may indicate the higher prestige of the PA in the miscellany, the only text designed to have large initials or miniatures. Style two decorations also may be part of a decorative hierarchy within the "romance" quires, suggesting that Ysambrace and The Awntyres were considered by Thornton to be more prestigious texts. Still, they are very rare, comparatively; if Thornton could make style two initials, money would be no object and these initials might have played a much larger role in the decorative hierarchy of the Lincoln Thornton MS. than they do. Although no positive evidence can be advanced, the complexity and rarity of these initials suggest a professional hand particularly if, as I suspect, Thornton is not responsible for style one either. Two points of evidence suggest that Thornton did not produce the style one initials. Most of the unfinished small initials in the PA are in one block in quire C, a small group of half-bifolia added to accommodate the end of the PA . No other quire in the Lincoln Thornton MS has all undecorated initials. If Thornton were the decorator this lapse in the PA makes no particular sense; but if he were dealing out job lots to artisans, overlooking this little leftover quire is more understandable: quires A and B would have been sent out for decoration before or while quire C was produced. Also, some quasi-armorial references to the Thornton family included in the initials of the PA , and the AMA as well, argue for professional involvement. In the PA one style one initial "A" contains a rebus on the family name: a "thorn" (hawthorn) tree and a tun or barrel (23v). A version of this same rebus is used on the gravestone of a later Robert Thornton, and thorn leaves figure prominently in the arms of the Thornton family at least since the funerary monument of our scribe's father. 17 The rendering of the hawthorn leaf here is pretty incompetent, however; in fact, it looks very much like the conventionalized foliage of all the other style one initials. If Thornton were the talented amateur illuminator for which he is given credit, he probably would have troubled to do a much better job on the top half of the rebus invoking the family arms. In the AMA a bird holds a scroll in its claws bearing the legend "Robert Thornton" next to a style three initial "K" (93v). There is no apparent connection to any heraldic devices of the Thorntons. The bird seems to be looking at two cats inhabiting and flanking an initial "B" across on the facing recto, fitting the general drollery habits of style three far better than it glorifies the honorable name of Thornton. Again this "heraldry" looks more like a professional adapting his style to a client's agenda than a direct armorial invention by Thornton as a socially conscious gentry amateur. The large blanks left in the PA may be explained in terms of piecework, also: waiting until a miniaturist and sufficient funds were available simultaneously. It is, of course, impossible to know whether Thornton intended miniatures, historiated initials, or simply very large initials in these spaces. The only space which is filled (6r) has a large "Q," a penwork enlargement of a typical style one foliate initial, so large initials may have been intended for the other spaces. 18 If so, however, it is unclear why Thornton would have left the other spaces unfinished. It is more likely that the blanks were meant for miniatures or historiated initials since there is evidence of the beginnings, at least, of an illumination program in the PA . Spaces for ten- to twelve-line initials in the PA are inset on every opening of facing pages up to f. 8. With an estimated four leaves missing from the front, Thornton seems to have planned an opening with eight to ten major miniatures or initials. And there is a series of smaller initials inhabited by kings (on five occasions), knights (two) and a dragon. Marginal instructions next to other large spaces provide instructions for miniatures or historiated initials at the point where the series of four- or five-line inhabited initials begins, and at a later point in the text. 19 Despite its unfinished state, the layout, the existing initials, and the remaining instructions establish the scope of Thornton's ambition for this text: a "front-loaded" opening display of large miniatures or initials to create the impression of a deluxe manuscript, assertions of major divisions, and a thematic program of illuminations emphasizing kingship. The text of the PA in this manuscript is lost up to the point when the young Alexander slays his biological father Anectanebus, as the latter had prophesied moments earlier. 20 The large initial spaces which follow mark incidents which anticipate Alexander's greatness. The first (1r) begins the story of the taming of Bucephalus; the next (2r) introduces Alexander's first battle, in which he defeats Nicholas, King of the Arridons; the third (2v) marks Alexander's first exchange with Darius, when Alexander takes the place of his sick father to refuse tribute; the fourth (3v) introduces the burial of Phillip and Alexander's assumption of the throne of Macedonia. After this point small initials (the first occuring at the bottom of 3v) begin to indicate new episodes and emphases. The planned opening program of large initials probably spanned Alexander's youth up to his assumption of his father's throne. Not only would the design assure a splendid decorative opening for a deluxe edition, the planned miniatures or initials would emphasize episodes which anticipate Alexander's legendary attributes: his steed, battle prowess, regal pride, and astonishing ability to win thrones. The remaining large spaces mark six other points in the narrative: Alexander's reception of God's prophecy (based on the Book of Daniel ) from the Bishop of the Jews (6r); Alexander's departure from Jerusalem to meet Darius, his greatest opponent (7r); Alexander's letter announcing his assumption of the throne of Darius (22v); Alexander's letter of challenge to King Porus of India (24v); The Queen of the Amazons' letter to Alexander (26r); Alexander's persuasive reply to the Amazons (26v). These planned miniatures or initials are clearly grouped in the text as three pairs, establishing major stages of Alexander's military advance east and fulfillment of his role as the exemplary conqueror. Yet the program of large initials is not extended to include the final battle with Porus, or Alexander's encounters with the wonders of the east, the gymnosophists, Dindimus the Brahmin, Queen Candace, or the Temple of the Sun and the Moon. Only a small style one initial inhabited by a dragon (38r) opening one set of subcontinental exotica, and one style two initial beginning Alexander's march through the desert to meet Porus (27r), distinguish these later adventures. Two reasons could be suggested for the limitations of this program. The large initials as they were designed are spaced economically throughout the text to maximize their decorative effect: an opening sequence, a pair a short way further along, and two more pairs grouped in the middle of the text. Also, the program as it stands emphasizes Alexander's military victories, assumption of thrones, and Judeo/Christian visions at the expense of Eastern bestiary marvels and pagan philosophical debate. Thornton's tastes or uses for the text may simply run to military, regal, and Christian prophetic material. More simply, one element of the Alexander story which goes into virtual eclipse in the East is Alexander's kingship. Up to his assumption of the throne of Darius, Alexander's regal qualities are being tested in what were by Thornton's time conventional romance topoi: battle, confrontation with didactic spiritual guides, the discourse of challenge and response. After Alexander enters India these tests are largely abandoned in favor of toying with wonders and playing identity games at the court of Queen Candace. Even his last major battle in the PA , with Porus of India, is brief and relatively anticlimactic, and set among the distracting variety of oriental marvels. A program of portrait initials and at least two planned large portrait miniatures or initials supports this apparent slant to Thornton's interests. The evidence we have for an illumination program points to a concentrated interest in the earlier images of kingship. After the "youth" series of large spaces an eleven-line space has a crude square drawn in (7r). Inside the square are the words "hic incipit". Alongside in the margin are the words "rex equitans". This plan for a miniature or historiated initial, what seems to be a conventional portrait of Alexander astride Bucephalus, occurs after Alexander has worshipped Jehovah and seen the prophecy of Daniel in Jerusalem, and marks the beginning of his journey to confront Darius. At this point, a few lines below this planned miniature, a program of king portraits in small initial "D"s and "A"s begins with a "D" (for Darius). Hereafter all "D" initials (always beginning "Darius") have the face of an older, bearded king; some of the small "A" initials have either a beardless man in armor (11v and 16v) or a young, beardless king (17r, again on the same page as a portrait "D"). 21 Later in the text (24r), when Alexander marches against Porus of India, Porus's letter of challenge is headed by a small initial "P" (beginning "Porus") inhabited by a king's face much like the "D" portrait. On the following verso Alexander's response, now using for himself the "king of kings and lord of lords" formula Darius had affected in his self-references, begins with an eleven-line space. This space is paired with the earlier missing blank beginning Alexander's letter to announce his assumption of Darius's throne, where Alexander first takes over the use of "king of kings and lord of lords." 22 In other words, as the large blanks for Alexander on 6r and 7r mark the opening of his movement East to confront Darius, an opponent portrayed in a small initial on 7r, the pair of large initials on 22v and 24v face off against the small portrait of Porus (24r), Alexander's second and last great individual military challenger. The next pair of large spaces also have instructions which suggest a royal face-off. The letter of Talifrede, Queen of the Amazons (26r), begins with a twelve-line space. In the margin is the notation "Regina regalibus cum duabus astantibus." 23 On the following verso Alexander's reply (which convinces the Amazons to submit without a battle) begins with a thirteen-line space (probably for Alexander), the last in the series of what could have been facing royal portraits. Not only do the small initials focus on kingship, then, but the placement and extant instructions for the large spaces reinforce that focus and emphasize the confrontation between Alexander and a sequence of royal figures. Initials and planned miniatures or initials throughout the PA thus expand the theme of kingship and royal challenge and response in the series of small portraits, most emphatically among military challengers: the philosophical challenges of the gymnosophists and Dindimus are given neither large miniatures or initials nor small portrait initials. The instructions left in the margins for initials in the PA (7r, 26r) may be designed for a subcontractor, though they could simply be self-reminders. Thornton always includes the initial letter in small form beginning the lines in the PA ; this habit might have kept the text readable while Thornton waited for its final form, or simply served as the initial. A miniature without an accompanying initial, however, seems unlikely given the importance the miniature would lend to the text division. The AMA , by comparison, has its style three initials frequently inhabited by grotesques and accompanied by drolleries without any sign of a meaningful program attached to these figures, or a hierarchy of decoration within the text. This poem also has a "frontispiece" with crude sketches of knights and a warhorse (52v), but the PA seems to have had a much more ambitious design planned with the same professionals who did all the other decorated initials in the Lincoln Thornton MS. Based on the decorative evidence, I would suggest the following reconstruction: Thornton copied the AMA and Octavyane first among the "romances," then had quires D-F decorated professionally, a luxury in keeping with the elevated subject of the AMA . At some later point he copied the PA , planning an even more lavish decorative scheme into which were incorporated all the remaining texts except the Liber de Diversis Medicinis , so that quires D-F were surrounded by a new, largely unified style one decorative hierarchy in which the AMA , by virtue of its relatively deluxe and numerous initials, was granted second place. In this same vein of what must remain speculation it is interesting to note that Thornton probably completed his miscellanies before his political star rose enough locally for him to be commissioned as a tax collector in the North Riding in 1453 and 1454, associating him with powerful local men apparently not among Thornton's circle of intimates during the time he was producing the Lincoln MS (Keiser 1979, 159-164). Although that same star appears to have fallen rather quickly (Thornton may have been suspected of involvement in North Riding disturbances related to the Neville-Percy rivalry), Thornton may have changed the arena for his assertion of status from literature to politics before the money or opportunity was available to have the PA illuminated. After 1450 the North Riding was clearly becoming a dangerous place to travel. Thornton may have just given up on taking his miscellanies to an illuminating center such as York. There was no lack of available illuminators and initial specialists in York. (Keiser 1979, 165; Thompson, 1987, 62 n. 29) It seems likely that the important market town close by Thornton's home in East Newton, Helmsley, would also have a modest share of professionals. Situated next to Rievaulx Abbey, one of the most important Cistercian monasteries in England (though long in decline at this point); next to the ancestral seat of the Roos, a powerful local aristocratic family ( VHCE: YNR , 1. 485); and possibly next to one of the oldest schools operating in the north of England; 24 Helmsley could have attracted the kind of initial specialists many secular documents of the time required. However, Helmsley is less likely to have been able to support a resident miniaturist so close to a center like York. The unfinished state of Thornton's two miscellanies would correspond to the relative availability and expense of professional services: small initials could be done locally (the single large style one initial in the PA might have been a "trial balloon" for the local talent); the large initials or miniatures would have been reserved for a trip to York with sufficient funds. There is substantial evidence that professional bookshops such as Thornton might have patronized would, in fact, employ separate artists for the tasks of initials and miniatures. 25 Overall the decorated initials in the Lincoln Thornton MS argue for Thornton's use of professional piecework whose provenance and expense would be visible to local society, accepted signs of the prestige of certain texts and the luxury value of the miscellany as a whole. We do not know whether any of the Lincoln Thornton MS decorations followed exemplars in their style, size, number, or placement. The evidence of the decorations themselves, predominantly style one among a wide range of texts, virtually eliminates the exemplars as the controlling force for the initials' decoration; and if Thornton did hire out that work he decided on the costs per text, significant choices in themselves. Whether or not Thornton produced the style one initials, whether or not he followed his exemplars, he clearly prepared the PA for a major, thematically coherent illumination program; he almost certainly gave the AMA a relatively extravagant professional decoration; and he is very likely to have designed the decorations in the other texts of the Lincoln Thornton MS in terms of the hierarchy established in these first two great poems. Despite their low profile among contemporary masterpieces of manuscript illumination, the initials of the Lincoln Thornton MS are rich lodes of information about a medieval provincial gentleman's conception of some of the major literary works of his time.</field>

This observation seems to come down to the point that both are in black ink. See Thompson's more cautious discussion in London Thornton , p. 58, and on p. 62 his discussion of whether one "Willa Frostt" may have had a hand in the decoration of the London MS. 6 Kathleen Scott in MS Bodley 283: the physical composition, decoration, and illustration (Oxford, 1980) provides valuable information for the period; other observations and classification can be found in Marc Drogin, Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique (New York, 1989); and L. N. Valentine, Ornament in Medieval Manuscripts, A Glossary (New York, 1965), 35-40. 7 The only substantial attempt to classify types I have found, concerned exclusively with grouping Chaucer MSS and of little help with less decorated provincial MSS generally, is Margaret Rickert's "The English Tradition in Border Decoration, 1400-1450," 565-583 in The Text of the Canterbury Tales , vol. 1, ed. John M. Manly and Edith Rickert (Chicago, 1940). 8 The TM facsimile adequately reproduces the initials for the basic stylistic comparisons of these very different styles. All observations given here can be confirmed easily by reference to this widely available facsimile. 9 See ff. 3v-49r and 105r-276v for examples; full citations given below. 10 On ff. 19r, 19v, 27r, 109r, 154r; see Rickert's "Group V" in "Border Illustration," p.582. 11 See ff. 53r-102r; full citations given below. On these East Anglian characteristics see Eric G.

These initials were judged "provincial" by Margaret Rickert in "Border Illustration," pp. 574-576, though this vague provenance might well be questioned.

      <field name="heading_text">The Transcription of the "Clerk's Tale" in MS HM140: Interpreting Textual Effects by William McClellan *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HM140, a late fifteenth-century anthology manuscript housed at the Huntington Library, has been prominent in the renewed discussion of the early transmission of Chaucer's work, primarily because it contains an "independent" version of the Clerk's Tale . The tale, according to Daniel Silvia, was the most frequently excerpted of the Canterbury Tales . HM140 has received this attention, in part, because it belongs to a category of manuscripts that have been recently revalued by Derek Pearsall, who has argued that such manuscripts provide us with invaluable information for surmising the moral and aesthetic taste of their audiences. HM140 has already been the subject of a groundbreaking article by Seth Lerer, who applies a codicological analysis of it to his interpretative reading of the tale. Lerer argues that the "excision" of the "Prologue" and two key transition stanzas just before the envoy strips the tale of its dramatic Canterbury context. 1 A major consequence of these changes is to narrow the aesthetic and moral scope of the story, modifying it to fit a conventionally pietistic, Lydgatean "homology" (311). This serious tone is reenforced with the addition of Chaucer's ballad "Truth" as a coda. Lerer thus gives us a useful characterization of the anthology's thematic logic, while presenting a plausible interpretation for the changes he finds in the text of the tale. However, in his discussion regarding the "excisions" Lerer makes certain assumptions about the scribe's editing of the tale. For example, he assumes that the changes in the text of the tale were made by the scribe, and, further, that these changes reveal the scribe's "implicit reading of the Tale" (316). The suppositions that Lerer makes about the scribe's "act" bear further scrutiny because they refer to the crucial issue of "intentionality," in this case, editorial intentionality. 2 Using the approach he initiated as point of departure, I want to examine the question of how we determine the scribe's or editor's "intention" from the remains of the manuscript. I will pursue this through a close analysis of the transcription of the texts in the first booklet of the manuscript, focusing on the Clerk's Tale . Such an analysis will give us insight into the manuscript's production process and will provide us with information for evaluating how the tale was appropriated and read. First, I will give an overview of the transcription of the texts in the first booklet of HM140 through an analysis of the scribal work stints and an examination of its ordinatio . Second, I will analyze the transcription of the Clerk's Tale , with the aim of evaluating possible reasons for the text's "excisions." Third, I will discuss the implications of this codicological analysis for an interpretative reading of the tale. Finally, I will suggest some possibilities for employing codicological analysis in the interpretation of texts from early in our tradition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Transcription of Texts There are two significant patterns in the transcription of the manuscript's text that can help us construct its production history: one is created by the different scribal hands and the other is generated by the different work stints of the scribes. The manuscript as it exists today is comprised of what were three different booklets: the first booklet consists of quires 1-6, the second, quires 7-9, and the third, quire 10. 3 At least eleven different scribes were involved in the writing of the manuscript. In the first booklet, which contains the Clerk's Tale , five different hands are evident in the copying of the text. All of the scribes wrote in secretary hands and their writing is relatively neat and fairly easy to read. The large number of different hands is unusual, and the pattern of alternation they form is even more so, especially in the sixth quire, as even a cursory analysis reveals. 4 The bulk of the writing in the first booklet of the MS was done by three scribes, with over half, 46 folios (the first two quires and quire 4, which contain about 70% of the Life of St. Albon ) written by Scribe 1. 5 Scribe 2 transcribed about twenty folios: all sixteen folios of quire 3 (ff31-46) and the recto side of folio 63 in quire 5. Both quires contain the Life of St. Albon . In addition, Scribe 2 copied almost three folios in three different stints in the sixth quire. Scribe 3 is responsible for all except one folio of the fifth quire, where the first four folios contain the text of St. Albon and the rest, ten folios, hold the Clerk's Tale . He copied virtually all of the Clerk's Tale . In all he is responsible for twenty two folios—fourteen in quire 5 and eight in quire 6. The other three folios contain different shorter works. Scribes 4 and 5 are minimally involved in the copying of the manuscript, and only in the eccentric sixth quire. Scribe 4 has three different stints amounting to about four folios, and scribe 5's total contribution to the transcription is only two lines on f92v. For the most part in the first five quires of the first booklet, the different scribal work stints coincide with the quire divisions. Scribe 1 inscribes the first three quires, and has no more involvement in the copying of the manuscript. Scribe 2 writes the fourth quire. This pattern is slightly modified in the 5th quire: Scribe 2 copies the recto side of f63, the first folio in the quire. Then scribe 3 takes over and continues his stint to f83, line 28, whence scribe 2 finishes up the Clerk's Tale and the ballad, "Truth." In addition, scribe 2 has two more short stints in quire 6. The continuing presence of scribe 2 at key junctures in the writing indicates that he probably functioned in a supervisory role in the transcription of the first booklet, at least in the medial or later stages of it. 6 His initial stint, which includes quire 4, ends on the recto of the first folio of quire 5. Most likely he was marking out the page format for scribe 3, who takes over the copying and completes quire 5 and about one third of quire 6 in his first stint. That scribe 2 was acting as a supervisor gains plausibility because he begins his second stint on line 29 of f83, taking over from scribe 3 to finish up the Clerk's Tale . He also executes two more short stints in quire 6 including the last work in this booklet, Lydgate's Testamentum . So scribe 2 has continuing, if interrupted, involvement in the transcription of the booklet, copying at least some part of five of the eight different works that are in it. These include all three of Chaucer's works in the manuscript, as well as the major works by Lydgate, St. Albon and the Testamentum . And his stints come at key junctures: he ends the Clerk's Tale and begins "Anelida" and completely transcribes the ballad, "Truth." However, scribe 3 also plays a significant role in the copying of the MS. He ends St. Albon , with its elaborate colophon, and begins the Clerk's Tale . He also begins Lydgate's Testamentum , including its title, and the short poem, "Uppone a Cross," which he titles and copies completely. The analysis thus far shows that the two scribes, 2 and 3, who were involved with the transcription of the Clerk's Tale played key roles in the overall transcription of the first booklet. It also shows that they worked in close proximity to each other, probably in the same shop, and that scribe 2 acted in a supervisory role. 7 My analysis also suggests that either the ordinatio was not fully worked out when the copying of the booklet was begun, or, more likely, that the original production plan was abandoned in the course of its transcription. A more detailed examination of the pattern formed by the work stints of the different scribes in the eccentric sixth quire strongly suggests that the latter was probably the case: the production of the booklet was increasingly interrupted and finally halted at the end of the sixth quire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Eccentric Sixth Quire Four of the five scribes who transcribed the first booklet wrote in quire 6. This alone suggests that the production procedure for this part of the manuscript was extremely unusual. Doyle and Parkes state that the usual work stint for a scribe was governed by the quire structure; that is, the smallest customary unit of work was the quire. But what is even more peculiar is that the pattern of alternation revealed by change in hand shows there were no less than twelve changes in the quire: Scribe 3 ff78-83 line 28 Clerk's Tale (5½ ff) Scribe 2 ff83 line 29-84 Clerk's Tale (1 f) "Truth" (½ f [½ of folio is blank]) Scribe 3 ff84v-85 line 16 "Uppone a Cross" (¾ f) Scribe 2 ff85 line 17-85v line 9 "Anelida" (½ f) Scribe 3 ff85v line 10-86 line 20 "Anelida" (½ f) Scribe 4 ff86 line 21-88v "Anelida (1 f [½ f87 blank]) "Midsomer Rose" (1½ ff) Scribe 3 ff89-90 "Midsomer Rose" (1 f) "Song of Virtue" (1 f) Scribe 4 ff90v-91 line 9 "Song of Virtue" (1¼ f) Scribe 3 f91 lines 10-13 Testamentum (4 lines, plus title) Scribe 2 ff91 line 14-91v line 20 Testamentum (1 f) Scribe 3 ff91v line 21-92v line 6 Testamentum (½ f) Scribe 5 f92v lines 8-9 Testamentum (two lines) Scribe 4 f92v lines 10-35 Testamentum (¾ f) This breakdown shows that the stints of the scribes are short and the changes of hand are frequent. The twelve changes, marking thirteen scribal work stints, is a phenomenal number, given that the standard work portion was a quire. The stints range from two lines to five-and-a-half folios with most of the stints (eight) a folio or less. Even more significant is that both the shortness of the stints and frequency of change increase towards the end of the quire, where fourteen stanzas of Lydgate's Testamentum are placed, suggesting that the writing was much interrupted and finally discontinued before the transcription of the work was completed. Although it cannot be absolutely determined from the residue of the manuscript whether or not the transcription of the Testamentum ended at f92v, I suspect that it did. I arrive at this conclusion because the next folio, which was the last of the quire, has been cut, most likely because it was blank, indicating that the copying of the work had been discontinued. 8 A plausible narrative of the booklet's production is one that describes it as moving away from a well organized effort where the ordinatio of the manuscript was known and where the work was being portioned out in the usual fashion. The regular pattern of the scribal writing stints in the first five quires, which follows the standard length, supports this thesis. The exception at the beginning of quire 5 where the second hand writes only the first page of f63 (one half folio) can easily be explained in terms of scribe 2's presumed supervisory role. The execution of the ordinatio in these first quires would also support such a thesis. In these, the writing, format, and decoration of the booklet's relatively plain ordinatio is well done and consistent. Although the ordinatio changes in the fifth quire, from the more elaborate formatting of St. Albon to the plainer layout of the Clerk's Tale , it is not until the sixth quire that the quality control of the booklet's production radically decreases. For example, rubrication ceases at f78v, the second page of the first folio in the sixth quire. At this point, the orderly production process was increasingly disrupted, and the transcription finally was halted in the initial stanzas of the Testamentum . The pattern formed by the different scribal hands and stints thus points to a narrative in which the production of the first booklet moves from a well organized effort to one that is much less so, indeed one that leaves the booklet unfinished. Such a pattern of destabilized and incomplete production can been seen in the booklet's larger organizing structure, its ordinatio .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Ordinatio of the First Booklet The ordinatio of the manuscript, as a whole, moves from the relatively well defined and elaborate to the reduced and indefinite. But even though the ordinatio of the MS in the first booklet is inconsistent, virtually all the works are set off by clear division boundaries and discrete formatting. The exception to this pattern is the conflation of Chaucer's Clerk's Tale and the ballad, "Truth." None of Chaucer's works is attributed to him and none has a title. By contrast, some of Lydgate's works are given titles and attribution, and two of them, St. Albon and "Uppone a Cross," have both. St. Albon , given a short title at the beginning, has an extended colophon that indicates, in addition to the author, the name of the person for whom Lydgate translated the work from French and Latin. 9 The elaborateness and detail of title and attribution are unique in the MS. For other ascribed works, as the poem, "Uppone a Cross," the attribution is by initials only, i.e. "JL," identifying Lydgate as the author. Two other poems that have the monograph "JL" at the end, "Midsomer Rose" and "Song of Virtue," do not have titles. 10 The title of "Uppone a Cross," which follows the Clerk's Tale-Truth , consists of the first two lines of the poem in Latin (f84). The other work that has a title, but no attribution of authorship, is Lydgate's Testamentum . So if one judges by the ordinatio , the works of Lydgate are accorded more importance than Chaucer's, with the Life of St. Albon , the first and longest work in the manuscript, having first place in the hierarchy. An examination of the mise-en-page of the folios reveals even more clearly the changes that occurs in the design and execution of the booklet's formatting. Although the format of HM140 is plain compared with many other manuscripts (such as the richly designed and executed Ellemere MS), the ordinatio of its first booklet changes from the fairly detailed format of St. Albon , where, for example, rubrication is used for marking text divisions and capitals, to a much simpler page format in the other works, as a comparison between St. Albon and the Clerk's Tale will demonstrate. For St. Albon , the layout, rubrication and capitalization are clearly well planned and consistently executed throughout. The first folio has thirty-three lines of text, and there are between thirty-three and thirty-six lines per folio, with an average of thirty-five. The text is organized in a rhyme royal stanza, its form set off by rubricated initial capitals and by spacing between stanzas. Decoration of the text is simple, but the use of rubrication is extensive. Besides the initial stanza capitals, the initial line capitals are ornamented with red. In addition, rubrication is used to underline key words in the text, usually proper names or nouns. There are from twelve to twenty-two of these underlinings per folio, which I think act as a guide to reading the text. 11 Whole words are rubricated as well, usually the divisio markers, highlighting the ends and beginnings of sections within the narrative. For example, on f14, at the end of the first part, a division marker appears in red letters: "Here Endith the First Boke and Begynnyth the Prologg of the Second Lyne of the Conuersion of the Blessid Prothomartir of all Inglond Seint Albone." 12 Occasionally there are marginal glosses in red ink, such as "Verba Auctoris" (f13v). Finally, at the end, the colophon is in red ink. The design and execution of the formatting of the text of St. Albon are done with obvious care. The work is titled and attributed. The stanza form is clearly marked with rhyme, rubrication, enlarged capitals, and spacing. Text divisions are marked in red, as are line capitals, and key words are underlined in red. In contrast, the layout of the second work in the manuscript, Chaucer's Clerk's Tale , is both less elaborate and less clearly marked. The Clerk's Tale begins on f68 and ends on f83v. If "Truth" is considered a conclusion to the tale, as I believe it should be, the ending is on f84. Unlike St. Albon , the tale contains few signals or directions for reading in its formatting. It has no title, no headings, no division markers of its parts, and no attribution of authorship. There is no "Prologue," the text beginning at the opening of Chaucer's Tale, E57 (IV.57): "There is ryght atte the West Syde of Ytaile. . . ." "Truth" is appended directly after the end of the tale's envoy, without title or break in the continuous line format, with an "Explicit" following the ballad. The number of lines per folio page is irregular, ranging from thirty-one lines on f68 to thirty-seven on f77, with the average being thirty-three lines. The initial letter of each line is capitalized and sometimes the initial capital of a page is slightly larger than the rest. The only large rubricated capital in the text is the tale's initial "T," which is three lines high. The other initial line capitals are only splashed with red, and this decoration ends at f78. There is no other rubrication. Except for the rhyme scheme of rhyme royal, which is disrupted, the stanza form is not marked or isolated; consequently, the text runs continuously, without spacings from beginning to end. None of the features which Parkes argues were commonly used to mark a verse format (i.e. spacing, illumination, capitals, rubrication, underlining, or paragraph markers) is present in the format of the tale ("Punctuation" 130). The tale in HM140 thus has a reduced, prosaisized format. Comparison of the formatting of St. Albon and the Clerk's Tale clearly shows that a shift occurred in the book's production between these two works. The well designed and executed format of St. Albon gives way to the much less carefully formatted and decorated text of the Clerk's Tale and the plainer format of the shorter works that follow in the booklet. 13 The modification in the format plan and execution of the Clerk's Tale marks a significant shift in the booklet's ordinatio and reflects a change in the status of the manuscript's production. The most obvious indication of this change is in the decorative detail, the splashing of the initial capitals with red ink, which stops about two thirds of the way through the text of the tale. This downscaling in the priority of the booklet's production might have resulted from a decommissioning of the manuscript's project. But without documentary evidence it is impossible to determine what the causes were for lowering the production priority, and for concomitant changes in the bibliographical text of the booklet. Consequently, the ordinatio or intentional structure of the manuscript remains ambiguous. The alteration in the booklet's ordinatio is also reflected in the transcription of its texts, where we see a similar reduction in the quality of the scribal copying near the end of the first booklet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Transcription of the Clerk's Tale Two different scribes transcribed the text of the Clerk's Tale : scribe 3 copied most of it, from f68 to f83 line 28; scribe 2 completed the tale, including the appended ballad, "Truth," f84 line 11. My own examination confirms Manly's original assessment that the transcription was ". . . a bad copy of a MS of good tradition," and that the writing was much interrupted, with little or no supervision and few corrections (435, 434). The frequent interruptions in the transcription, I think, may account for the many missing lines in the text of the tale. Besides the "Prologue," the two other sections of the Clerk's Tale that others have noted as missing are the seventy-two lines (E189-260) near the beginning of the tale, probably as the result of a lost folio following f69, 14 and, as I have already mentioned, the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas (E1163-1176). I have found seven other major lacunae, totalling thirteen lines, including a complete stanza, as well as several instances of line transpositions, and one repetition. 15 In considering the pattern of scribal "error" I am discounting the absent "Prologue" because none of the "independent" versions of the Clerk's Tale has it, and it is external to the tale. 16 I think that it is highly unlikely that folio 68, between the end of St. Albon on f67v and the beginning of the Clerk's Tale on f68v, was left blank for copying the "Prologue" at a later time, because there is insufficient space here to fit its fifty-eight lines. Except for the line transpositions on f83v in scribe 2's stint, all of the other errors were made by scribe 3. The configuration of missing lines and transpositions forms an alternating pattern between folios where there are no mistakes and those where there are, with the alternations increasing in frequency towards the end of the tale. 17 Comparing the errors in the transcription of quire 5 with those in quire 6 shows even more clearly the decreasing quality control of the scribe's writing. 18 Not only is the frequency of "error" higher in quire 6, but the total number of missing lines is greater. 19 In addition, the kinds of "errors" made in quire 5, such as the three line transpositions, suggest that the scribe was more attentive to his work here than in quire 6, which has only missing lines. 20 This points to a conclusion that the quality of scribe 3's work decreased substantially towards the end of his writing stint of the Clerk's Tale .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Implications for Interpretation of the "Clerk's Tale" Exactly what kind of guidance does a reconstruction of the production process for HM140 provide for evaluating the absence of major sections, the "Prologue" and the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas, from the text of the Clerk's Tale ? These omissions are crucial for constructing any interpretation of the tale in its HM140 context because these sections of the tale provide the reader with a guide for reading the work. I have argued elsewhere that, in The Canterbury Tales , the "Prologue" introduces two of the narrative voices which constitute the tale's dialogic discourse (Multi-Voiced). The two transitional stanzas towards the tale's end also promote the dialogic voicing of the tale because they allude specifically to the performative frame of the Canterbury context. The absence of these passages in the HM140 site has the effect of reducing the complex and contradictory voicing of the tale to a more monologic narrative voicing, which fits a more conventional moral viewpoint. So it is important for any interpretation of the tale in the HM140 anthology to evaluate whether their absence is the result of deliberate editing, omission in the exemplar, or scribal mis-transcription. This analysis shows that it is very probable that the scribe simply missed these two stanzas in his copying. Their omission comes right at the end of his stint, just before the final five lines on f84, and he had just dropped a complete stanza several folios earlier (f81; E1009-1015). This, combined with the fact that the frequency of the line omissions increased towards the end of his stint, makes it plausible that he simply missed the lines, possibly because he was interrupted. The fact that his stint ended just three lines before the end of the folio page strongly suggests that it was not planned but the result of some distracting interruption, which may very well have been the reason for the termination. But my conclusions that the missing stanzas were the result of mis-transcription are also based on an analysis of the tale in other manuscripts. Such a conclusion, however, is not immediately apparent. When I examined the twenty-two manuscripts in the group Manly identified as having a close textual relationship with HM140 I found the following. 21 Virtually all of the manuscripts in this group (except Np and Ra1) have the "Prologue," which is not surprising because all, except Np, contain the tale in its Canterbury context. Most have the "Wife of Bath" stanza (except Ld2, Lc, Mg, Np), and all have the "Lordynges" stanza. One conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that the version of the tale in HM140 is unusual for the group with which it shares a close textual affiliation because it is missing important contextualizing sections of the tale that virtually all others have. In a detailed analysis comparing all the missing lines in HM140 with those of the four other manuscripts that Manly identified as having the closest textual affiliation, I found that none has any of the omissions that HM140 has, and only one has a single set of similar line transpositions. 22 The fact that there are so many missing lines unique to HM140 confirms my conclusion that the omissions in the text, including the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas, could have resulted from disruptions in the copying process itself, and not from editorial changes or omissions in the exemplar. An examination of 6 other manuscripts randomly chosen from the group sharing a close textual affiliation with HM140 (Ry1, S12, Ld2, Np, Cp, La) further confirms this evaluation. Except for La, which transposes lines 456/457, none of these MSS has any of the line transpositions of HM140. And except for Np, none of these manuscripts is missing any of the lines lacking in HM140. 23 But it is possible that some changes in the text of the tale are the result of the tale's new non-Canterbury context. Unlike virtually all of the manuscripts with which it shares a close textual affiliation, HM140 contains an "independent" version of the tale. When we look at this class of manuscripts, a slightly different pattern emerges: none of these manuscripts has the "Prologue" or "Wife of Bath" stanza. Thus we can deduce that the usual ordinatio of the tale in non-Canterbury sites is without the contextualizing frame that the Prologue provided. And the omission of the "Wife of Bath" stanza is not unusual even in the Canterbury context, where it is absent in about twenty manuscripts. So it is possible that the exemplar for HM140 had no "Prologue" or "Wife of Bath" stanza. Both these patterns, which suggest different histories for the tale's transcription, raise serious doubts about the deliberate editing out of the two transition stanzas in the HM140 context. A plausible narrative regarding the omissions is that both the "Prologue" and "Wife of Bath" stanza were absent in the exemplar and that the scribe miscopied the "Lordynges' stanza, as he did the earlier stanza (f81 seven lines [E1009-15] missing between lines 2 and 3). The possibility of a miscopying of the stanza has an even greater plausibility because it occurs right at the end of scribe 3's stint. But an even more important point is that we cannot determine from the manuscript "evidence" whether these omissions of text were intentional "excisions," as Lerer claims (and if they were, at what point in the process of manufacture they occurred) or whether they were a consequence of the problematics of production. These conclusions regarding the poor quality of the transcription and the standard ordinatio of the "independent" versions raise serious doubts that the absent sections of the text were deliberately edited out. What I think this detailed codicological analysis of HM140 makes abundantly clear is that the quality of the manuscript's production was not high, or rather that it suffered a radical decrease in the sixth quire, where most of the Clerk's Tale was transcribed. Consequently, the inferences that can be drawn about the missing parts of text have to be carefully qualified. The analysis shows that the manuscript "evidence" is, at best, ambiguous, throwing real doubt on the definitive status of the "intentional structure" of the tale's ordinatio . The lack of a clear conception of this structure makes it impossible to ground any interpretation of the tale. The destabilization created by the low quality control of the tale's transcription is also advanced by other ambiguous features in the residue of the manuscript: the unfinished state of the first two booklets and the heterogeneous collocation of booklets in the manuscript's compilatio .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Coda: Brief Thoughts on Future Directions for Codicological Analysis in the Interpretation of Texts As the analysis of MS HM140 shows, it is impossible to ascertain the scribe's or editor's "intention," especially when external documentary evidence is lacking as is often the case with texts that have been transmitted to us from early in our tradition. But while the editor's specific "intentions" are not recuperable, I think a codicological analysis of a manuscript can provide us with information which we can use in interpreting its texts. I would like to briefly suggest the direction such an approach might be developed. In addition to analyzing the transcription of texts, this approach would consider the presentational features, such as page layout and decoration, as well as the larger organizing concepts, compilatio and ordinatio , that A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes have shown are important for the interpretation of texts (186). It would also take into account Jerome McGann's argument that the bibliographic text is crucial for interpreting the linguistic text (57). Most importantly, it would have recourse to Bakhtin's general theory of dialogic discourse, which ties together the analysis of presentational features with the social and collaborative aspects of textual transmission. For Bakhtin, who understood discourse as fundamentally social, the formal features of a verbal work of art are a constitutive part of its meaning (259). 24 Such an approach will give us a way of construing an interpretative model that has the virtue of utilizing the precise information generated from an analysis of the manuscript, the material residue of the text's construction site, to help construct an "intentional structure" for reading the texts it contains. Yet it also takes into account the overdetermined, social aspects of textual transmission. While this may make us more aware of the problematic nature of that transmission, it also gives us a more nuanced way of imagining the historical world(s) presented in those texts dispatched to us. Finally, I think the most important issue that HM140's problematic archaeology helps us to confront is that manuscripts are the leftovers of construction sites whose traces and marks have to be interpreted. The manufacture of information about their compositional process constitutes an interpretation, and hence does not stand outside the hermeneutic circle to be used as "evidence." They are not self-explanatory compositions with autonomous set(s) of meaning(s), but residues of communicative structures that we must reconstruct so that they can speak to us. This reconstruction is an on-going, event-ual constituting of their "truth." 25</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I want to thank the Huntington Library, where HM140 is housed, for making the MS available to me and for providing me with a congenial working environment. I want to thank the NEH for supporting the initial stages of this study with a summer grant, and Baruch College and the CUNY Research Foundation for their continuing support of my work. I also want to thank Martin Stevens for his supportive criticism. Finally, I thank Steven Kruger and Peter Hitchcock who read and offered valuable suggestions in the final stages of this essay. The mistakes, however, are mine. 1 One stanza is addressed to the "lordynges" and the other refers to the "Wife of Bath" (E1163-1176). All references to the modern edition of the "Clerk's Tale" are to the Riverside Chaucer . 2 Lerer himself seems to be aware of this difficulty, for early in his essay he suggests that he is using the term "scribes" in the widest construal of those who "read, wrote and rewrote Chaucerian manuscripts for their own purposes" (311). His employment of "scribe" as a metonymy for the whole process of textual transmission covering a period of more than half a century is a helpful and convenient way of specifying agency in the transcription of a text. Yet the way he uses the term in his discussion can be confusing. Sometimes he seems to use it as a marker of "intentionality" to explain textual changes. Consequently, the sense that these changes are overdetermined, which is included in his original formulation, tends to be neglected. I think we always have to be careful to regard these changes as the product of a multiple set of scribal/editorial practices carried out over an extended period of time. Hence, lacking external "evidence," we should always be aware of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of specifying exactly when and why and by whom they were made. 3 Unlike Manly and Dutschke, I consider quires 7 to 9 to be a separate, unfinished booklet that was combined with the other two booklets in the early sixteenth century when the manuscript was bound. I discuss the issue of the manuscript's composite structure in an article, "A Codicological Analysis of the Quire Structure of MS HM140 and Its Implications for a Revised Ordinatio ." 4 I am following Manly and Dutschke in the identification of the hands. I also consulted with Ralph Hanna III about several key junctures, such as the change of scribal hands at the end of the Clerk's Tale . The following is a breakdown of the hands in the first booklet: Scribe 1 : ff1-30v (quires 1&amp;2), ff47-62v (quire 4—i.e. if textual ordination is followed, this should be quire 3, but probably was transposed with quire 4 when the MS was bound). Scribe 2 : ff31-46v (quire 3, but as already noted should be quire 4), f63 (quire 5), ff83 line 29-84, ff85 line 17-85v line 9, ff91 line 14-91v line 20 (quire 6). Scribe 3 : ff63v-83 line 28 (virtually all of quire 5 which ends at f77, and quire 6, ff78-83, ff84v-85 line 16, ff85v line 10-86 line 20, ff 89-90, f91 lines 10-13, ff91v line 21-92v line 7 (all in quire 6). Scribe 4 : ff 86 line 21-88v, ff90v-91 line 9, f92v lines 10-35 (all in quire 6); Scribe 5 : f92v lines 8-9 (quire 6). 5 As I noted above, the order of the third and fourth quires was transposed when the manuscript was bound. As it stands now Scribe 1 inscribed quires 1, 2, and 4. Scribe 2 copied quire 3 which was originally quire 4. 6 Although Manly notes "no supervision; few corrections . . ." (434) in the copying of the Clerk's Tale , his evaluation was probably based on explicit marks of supervision, such as marginal notation, of which there are none. 7 Lerer concludes that the manuscript was probably produced in the household of the "northern gentry" (312). This accords with Ralph Hanna's suggestion to me that production features of the manuscript indicate that it might have been produced in a private household, not a commercial shop. Such a provenance might help to explain the transcription problems in quire 6. But as Parkes and Doyle have argued, scribes often worked in close collaboration on commercially produced manuscripts. From the external evidence we have it is not possible to determine with any certainty where the manuscript was produced. 8 The text of the Testamentum runs to the end of the verso of f92. My examination shows that this folio has been cut away leaving a one inch strip. 9 "Here endith the glorious lyf and passyoun of the blessid martir Seint Albone and seint Amphiball which glorious livis were tranlatid oute of ffrenssh and latyn by dane John Lydgate monke of Bury at the request and prayer of Master John Whetamstede the yere of oure Lorde M CCCC xxxix [1439] and of the said Master John Whetamstede of his Abisse xix." 10 MacCracken thinks the monogram at the end of the poem "Uppone A Crosse" "looks like J L" ( Minor Poems , Part I.254). "Midsomer Rose" ends with an Explicit followed by "JL" and "Song of Virtu" ends with an "Amen" followed by "JL." (See Minor Poems , Part II.785, 838). The point is arguable, but my own examination of the MS confirms this opinion. More to my point, however, is that if these are attributions of authorship they are far less explicit than the full one given to St. Albon . 11 For example, f13v has the following words underlined: Albon, martire, Albot, clerke, Anapt, lybrarie, coffers, poyettis, prudent, phelozyfires, ethiologie, whete, Whete, glenys, phelozifers, memory, Reportery, knyghthod, passion. Towards the end of the work, beginning with f65 the refrain 'O prothomartir of Brutis Albion" is underlined in red. It occurs twelve times in the closing stanzas. 12 Some other examples follow: On f15 the end of the prologue of the second book has a rubricated division marker, "Her Endith the Prollogg. And begynnth the Seconde Boke of the Glorious Prothomartir Seint Albon Howe he was made Gourernour of the Cite of Verolamye." F59 has a rubricated, inter-stanzaic line in Latin repeated four times, two recto and two verso: "Albanus Ver Egregius Martir Extat Gloriosus." On f60 the end of the second book is marked by the following rubric: "Explicit passio sancti Albani Incipit passion Sancti Amphibali sociorumque suorum cum Translatione Sancti Albani." 13 I think that there are a number of reasons for the change in the verse format of the Clerk's Tale to what I call a prose formatting, and that this change reflects more the textual and ideological status of the tale rather than production values per se. I discuss this reformatting in an article interpreting the tale in its HM140 context, "The Consequences of 'Treuth': Reading Two Versions of the Clerk's Tale ." But the changes in decoration do reflect the downscaling of its production priority. 14 The 70 lines that are missing would very comfortably fit into the number of lines per page, which varied from 31 to 37. According to the pattern of the quire structure, this folio would have been of vellum. 15 In my examination of the transcription of the Clerk's Tale I focused on the major "errors" and lacunae, and for the most part noted those variations at the unit level of a line or greater. I did not record variations within the line, though there are many. I did note and record one scribal "correction" where a dropped line was inserted between two already written lines. The purpose of my examination is not to provide an exhaustive description of the copying of the tale, but to generate sufficient information to evaluate the quality of the scribes' work. In the listing of the variations in the transcription of the tale I also give reference to the Riverside Edition of Chaucer's Works , indicating either the missing line or the section where line transpositions occurred. Quire 5 (ff68v to 77; 9 1/2 folios): 1 f68v lacuna: "Prologue" [E1-56] 2 f71 lacuna: line missing between lines 24 &amp; 25 [E353] 3 f71v transposition: lines 19 &amp; 20 between lines 23 &amp; 24 [E379-385] 4 f72v correction: line 6 squeezed between lines 5 &amp; 7 [E399] 5 f72v transposition: lines 31 &amp; 32 transposed [E456-462] 6 f73 repetition: line 1 repeats penultimate line (31) on f72v [E458] 7 f73 transposition: lines 2 &amp; 3 transposed [E459-460] 8 f74v lacuna: line missing between lines 2 &amp; 3 [E558] 9 f74v lacuna: line missing between lines 8 &amp; 9 [E565] Quire 6 (ff78 to 84, line 11; 6 1/6 folios): 10 f78 lacuna: line missing between lines 4 &amp; 5 [E798] 11 f78 lacuna: line missing between lines 22 &amp; 23 [E817] 12 f79 lacuna: line missing between lines 21 &amp; 22 [E886] 13 f81 lacuna: 7 lines (stanza) missing between lines 2 &amp; 3 [E1009-15] 14 f83 lacuna: 14 lines (2 stanzas) missing between lines 21 &amp; 22 [Lordynges and Wife of Bath stanzas, E1163-76] 15 f83v transpositions: multiple line transpositions in Envoy, lines 18 to 24 [18, 20, 22, 23, 19, 21, 24] 16 The six extant manuscripts with "independent" versions of the tale are: Harley 1239 (Ha1), Harley 5908 (Hl4), Longleat 257 (Ll1), Naples XIII.B.29 (Np), Rawlinson C86 (Ra4), and HM140. 17 In the first two-and-one-half folios, ff68v to 70v, there are no major lacunae or line transpositions. In the next four, ff71 to 74v, there are eight major mistakes, at least one per folio (except f73v), and three folio pages that have two each, ff72v, 73, and 74v. In the next three folios, ff75 to 77v, there are none. In the first one-and-one-half folios of quire 6, ff78 to 79R, there are three major errors, two on one page. On the next one-and-one-half folios, 79v to 81v, there are none. On f81 there is a major lacuna of seven lines, followed by one-and-one-half folios, ff81v to 82v, where there are no errors. Finally, on f83, there is the major lacuna of fourteen lines, the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas, and on f83v, Scribe 2, who has taken over the writing at the end of f83, has several line transpositions in the final lines of the envoy. The lacunae increase in frequency and size as the transcription of the tale progresses. 18 I am not counting the error I listed as #4 because it is, as I note, an interlinear insertion of a line, that is, a correction of a missed line. 19 In quire 5 there are three separate lacunae, all consisting of one line each. In quire 6 there are five instances of omission, three of one line each, one of seven lines, and one of fourteen lines, totalling twenty-four lines. 20 There are several possible reasons for transposing a line. The most obvious is that the scribe was following the transposition order of his exemplar, which may be the case in the transpositions in lines 31 and 32 on f72v and lines 2 and 3 on f73. Another is that the scribe just mixed up the lines. But a third may be that the scribe missed a line, realized he had done so, and then added it after the line he had just transcribed. Looking at the one correction I listed in quire 5 and the cluster of errors at the end of f72v and the beginning of f73 will give a good illustration of scribe 3's working procedure and make my conclusion about his practice more concrete. In the first example, the missed line correction on f72, line 6 is squeezed between lines 5 and 7: 5 As in a cote or in a ox stall 6 |But noryshid in an Emprous hall| 7 To euery wyght waxen she is so dere 8 |But| And worshipfull that folke there she was The "But" in line 8 is superlinear and partially erased. This correction is very interesting because it gives us a rare opportunity of "seeing" scribe 3 correct a mistake. I surmise that scribe 3 missed line 6 beginning with, "But noryshid" and later caught his omission. The partially erased superlinear "But" on line 8 indicates that he probably was going to place the omitted line there, but corrected this and squeezed it between 5 and 7, which is the proper order. This potentially missed line shows the scribe correcting himself and suggests that the quality control of the writing was still probably quite good. A second series of textual variations to consider occurs at the end of one folio and the beginning of another, which may account for some confusion. Near the end of f72v, scribe 3 transposed the last lines of the folio, 31 and 32. He then repeated the penultimate line (31) of 72v as the first line of f73 and transcribed lines 2 and 3 on f73: f72v 30 He had assayed here inowe before 31 Her for to tempt and alway more and more 32 And founde here euer goode what nedith it f73 1 Here for to tempe and all way more and more 2 But as for me I say euyll it sitte 3 Thought som men preyse it for asotill witte Here is the passage from the Riverside Chaucer for comparison: He hadde assayed hire ynoght bifore, And foond hire evere good; what neded it Here for to tempt, and alwey mooore and moore, Though som men preise it for a subtil wit? But as for me, I sey that yvele it sit (456-460) Here we have a cluster of three mistakes; the first two, at least, are closely connected. The earlier transposition of lines 31 and 32 probably resulted in the second mistake of line repetition. When scribe 3 started f73 he probably referred to line 32, the last line on F72v, beginning "And founde . . ." (one of the transposed lines). He then repeated the line beginning, "Here for to tempe. . . ." This suggests that his exemplar had the proper line order. The scribe then wrote the next two lines in transposed order, which suggests that the work had been much interrupted. Both these line transpositions were made in the texts of manuscripts that Manly identifies as having a close textual affiliation to that in HM140: lines 456 and 457 in Rawlinson Poetry 223 (Ra3) and lines 459 and 460 in Harley 7335 (Ha5) and Trinity College Cambridge R.3.3. So it is plausible that these transpositions, especially that of lines 459 and 460, were in the scribe's exemplar. 21 Those manuscripts in the group where Manly placed HM140 are: Additional 35286 (Ad3), Harley 7335 (Ha5), Rawlinson Poetry 223 (Ra3), Trinity College Cambridge R.3.3. (Tc1), Cambridge Dd.4.2 (Dd), Egerton 2864 (En3), Additional 5140 (Ad1), Harley 7334 (Ha4), Sion College (Si), Naples XIII.B.29 (Np), Royal 17 D.XV (Ry1), Laud 739 (Ld2), Additional 24178 (Ad2), Hatton Donat (Ht), McCormick (Mc), Rawlinson Poetry 141 (Ra1), Lichfield 2 (LC), Morgan 249 (Mg), Corpus Christi 198 (Cp), Landsdowne 851 (La), and Sloan 1686 (Sl2). 22 I made a detailed examination of the microfilm of these four MSS: Additional 35286 (Ad3), Harley 7335 (Ha5), Rawlinson Poetry 223 (Ra3), and Trinity College Cambridge R.3.3. (Tc1). Except for one set of two line transpositions in the passage E456-460, none of these manuscripts has any of the other omissions or transpositions that HM140 has. All have the Prologue, and three, Ad3, Ra3 and Tc1, have the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas, as well as the envoy. It is not possible to ascertain whether or not Ha5 originally had these stanzas because the text breaks off at E1105, probably because of lost folios. 23 Naples XIII.B.29 is a special case, because its missing lines may very well be the result of folios lost after the transcription of the tale. The text of the tale starts at E92 and is missing lines E1114 to 1194, the section where the "Lordynges" and "Wife of Bath" stanzas are located. Since Np contains an "independent" version of the Clerk's Tale , the prologue may have been eliminated to begin with. Either the "Wife of Bath" or the "Lordynges" stanzas may not have been included in the original transcription of the MS since the 80 lines that are missing add up to about 10 more than the average number of 35 lines per folio in the MS. There are, however, folios of 41 lines in Np so it is entirely possible that they were originally there. 24 To quote Bakhtin: "Form and content in discourse are one, once we understand that verbal discourse is a social phenomenon—social throughout its entire range and in each and every of its factors, from the sound image to the furthest reaches of abstract meaning" (259). For a synoptic overview of his theory of dialogic discourse see my article, "The Dialogic Other: Bakhtin's Theory of Rhetoric." 25 See Gianni Vattimo for discussions of the relation of a work of art and "truth" in the chapter, "Ornament/Monument" (79-89), and of our relation to the classic texts of the Western tradition in the chapter entitled "Hermeneutics and Anthropology" (145-163, especially 161).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Images of the Word: Separately Published English Bible Illustration 1539-1830 by G. E. Bentley, Jr *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What is a Bible?—are the New Testament or the Apocrypha or annotations or illustrations intrinsic to what Christians call the Bible? To whom does the Word of God belong?—to priests or to the king or to all believers? And what is the language of the Bible?—Hebrew (as in Genesis) or Aramaic or Greek (as in the Septuagint) or Latin (as in St Jerome's translation) or English? The answers to such questions have profound consequences not only in theology and politics but in publishing history as well. In particular, for most of the English-speaking world since 1539 the language of the Bible has been English, since 1611 the most frequently reprinted English translation has been that commissioned by James I, and the Crown has claimed perpetual copyright in this Authorized Version of the Old and New Testaments. However, many early Bibles were illustrated with manuscript illuminations or with woodcuts, and, in the period before moveable type was widely used, block-books often gave a maximum of Bible illustration with a minimum of biblical text. The English crown claimed exclusive publishing rights to the verbal text, but did this right encompass editions of the King James translation which were curtailed (say, the New Testament only) or editions with extensive learned annotations or with illustrations? The interpretation of these problems was in general delegated by the Crown to the Royal Printer (sometimes in association with his delegated associates the university presses of Oxford and Cambridge), and the interpretations seem to have changed profoundly between about 1611 and 1802—or at least the publishing practices apparently based upon such interpretations changed profoundly. In this essay I wish to set forth some of the ways in which holy pictures were added to the Holy Word in Britain between 1539 and 1830. Throughout, the phrase "English Bible illustrations" refers to works intended for an audience in England, or perhaps in Britain. I have not looked for works published in the British colonies or in what became the United States of America—but no separate suite of Bible illustrations published in North America before 1830 is known to me. Protestants in general and English Puritans in particular insisted that the text of the Bible should be very widely available, but there was tension between those Puritans, who wanted direct access to The Word of God—and nothing but The Word of God, not cluttered up with Papist and heathen graven images—and readers who wished to rejoice in the glory of God in both word and image. Some of the earliest translators of the Bible into English, such as William Tyndale, felt so strongly about the vital importance of what they were doing that they were willing to give up their lives for it and suffer martyrdom at the stake, but the earliest published English translations of the Bible were largely unadorned. However, when Henry VIII decided to print these translations for his own church in 1540 rather than burning them and their authors, he or his agents commissioned for the adornment of the biblical text graven images not only similar to but identical with those which had appeared in Continental Roman Catholic Bibles printed in Latin. The decoration of the official Great Bible of the reformed Church of England was therefore scarcely distinguishable from that of the unreformed Church of Rome. Naturally this was a grievance to iconoclastic Puritans, particularly since every parish church in England was required to possess a copy of this Great Bible with its graven images. Sculptured saints in British cathedrals lost their heads, stained glass windows in English churches were smashed, and paintings on sacred walls and books were effaced. In official English Bibles—that is, in those printed by the King's printer and by Oxford and Cambridge university presses—illustrations became less and less common, and often they disappeared altogether. The fact of their disappearance is plain, and the cause probably lies in significant part with Puritans in general and iconoclasts in particular. The designs which were allowed to persist longest were those of a strictly exemplary and explanatory character, exhibiting ceremonial details such as Aaron's Regalia and an altar with offerings. But of course these unimaginative designs still offended many Puritans, who deplored the elaborately scripted rituals of the High Church. For over a century, from 1540 until 1659, there was scarcely any innovation or ambition manifested in the decoration of Bibles published in England, and the tradition that the Bible contained The Word of God but not The Image of God was so strong that there were very few illustrated English Bibles between 1660 and about 1740. However, the desire for Bible illustrations plainly persisted, particularly among the prosperous middle classes, and speculative publishers found increasingly ingenious ways of circumventing the profitable Crown copyright in the Authorized Version of the Bible. What they did was, in general, no more publishing piracy, no more against the law, than is, say, the printing of English books in countries which do not recognize English or international copyright law, such as the United States before 1870 or China before the 1980s or Taiwan today. However, it did deliberately test the limits of the authority claimed by the Crown in the King James translation of the Bible. And sometimes what they did was regarded by the copyright holders as being morally reprehensible though perhaps not legally punishable. There was no shortage of Bible illustrations, and entrepreneurs and picture-lovers achieved what the copyright laws and the iconoclastic tradition had combined to prevent: genuinely illustrated Bibles. For about seventy years from 1659, ambitious booksellers who had no right to publish the King James translation of the Bible nonetheless profited from its popularity by issuing suites of Bible-prints which the purchasers could bind with Bibles, even with Bibles purchased from the bookseller who sold them the prints. And beginning early in the eighteenth century, various ways were devised for printing Bible illustrations with the Authorized Version of the Bible without being sued for infringement of copyright. The first authorized edition of the Bible in English, the Great Bible of 1539, which was placed in every parish church in the kingdom, was extensively illustrated with small, generally unimaginative woodcuts. 1 These designs were scattered through the text, but most of them were concentrated in the legalistic sections of Exodus. The woodcuts themselves originated in Paris, but the designs had a long history before they were re-engraved in 1539. 2 They represented An Altar or The Regalia of the High Priest or Pharaoh's Host at the Red Sea, and the images were so highly stereotyped that one warrior or prophet could be used to depict many individuals—82 woodcuts made 97 prints. One of the most piquant (Plate 1) represents Bathsheba surprised while bathing in the public fountain by a servant who politely tips his hat to her and hands her a message, while David eagerly observes the scene from a window about forty feet away. The same scenes were repeated in later editions of the English Bible, sometimes from the same woodblocks and sometimes re-engraved, and a few were added, but the number of plates declined as the blocks wore out, and there were very few additions to the iconographical canon in England until over a century later. While the tradition of Bible decoration was withering in England from 1540 to 1660, it was flourishing on the Continent. Not only were many of the Bibles printed in Italy and France and Germany illustrated lavishly and handsomely, but many suites of Bible illustrations were published separately, 3 to be enjoyed by themselves or added to the text of the Bible. These Continental designs were by artists as distinguished as Hans Sebald Beham (1529, 1533, 1537, 1539, 1551, 1553-54, 1561) and Holbein (1543, 1547, 1549) and Raphael (1649, 1675, 1698), and the publications were clearly aimed at an audience which was international, or at least multi-lingual. Of course the early titles were usually in Latin, but from a surprisingly early date these suites of Bible illustrations had titles in several languages, such as the Imagines et Figvrae Bibliorvm; Images et Figvres de la Bible; Beelden ende Figvren wt den Bybel (1580-82). The most common languages were Latin, German (later Dutch), and French, though a few are in English and Italian; I have found no example from Spain. Many of the biblical scenes represent fighting men in sixteenth-century armour. Of course, the images are often explicitly sympathetic to the Church of Rome; in Holbein's plate for Genesis i, "Adam and Heua ar also created" in The Images of the Old Testament (1549), for instance, Heua is taken from Adam's side by God wearing the pope's triple-tiara. The most ambitious of these works are in folio, of course, but there are many in quarto and even octavo, 4 and the number of plates is often staggering. Biblia veteris Testamenti et Historiae, Artificiosis picturis effigiata (Francfurti: Chr. Egonolphus, 1551) had 281 octavo plates, and Histoire Sacrée de la Providence et de la Conduite de Dieu Sur les Hommes (Paris: l'Auteur, 1728) had five hundred in quarto! Many of these collections of plates were enormously ambitious, expensive, and beautiful, and, until after the death of Oliver Cromwell, there was nothing at all like them in England. The declining emphasis upon visual biblical iconography in England was doubtless due in part to Puritan sentiments concerning Graven Images, 5 but it was also related to the lack of distinguished or even competent designers and engravers in England and to the lack of patronage or of a market for fine printing. In ideas and words the English press was extraordinarily vigorous and adventurous, but technically and aesthetically it was far behind its Continental rivals in Paris and Amsterdam and Venice. The situation in publishing illustrations to the Bible in English was complicated by the fact that the copyright in the King James Translation of 1611 was held in perpetuity by the Crown, and the Authorized Version could be printed in England only by the King's Printer and his delegates, the learned university printers of Oxford and Cambridge. 6 Since, from 1611 onward, the text of the vast majority of Bibles printed in England was that of the King James translation, only these three printers had any significant incentive to produce illustrations to be published in English Bibles. 7 And since they had a monopoly on the most vendible translation with a growing market, they seemed to have little incentive to indulge in the added expense of illustrations. Indeed, the first important new illustrations printed by a Bible patentee (or his delegate) with the King James translation of the Bible were those produced for the great folio Bible of John Field in Cambridge in 1659-1660 (see Plate 2), followed by that of John Baskett in Oxford in 1716-1717. However, there was clearly thought to be a market among the English for Bible illustrations, and in the sixteenth century at least two publications were aimed at it: Storys and Prophesis out of the Holy Scriptur Garnyschede with faire Ymages and wiih Deuoute Praeirs [by Nycholas Coppyn] (Andwarp: S. Cowke, 1536) in octavo, and The Images of the Old Testament (Lyons: Iohan Frellon, 1549), with 96 plates (by Holbein) in quarto. Further, English Bibles were sometimes extra-illustrated by the purchaser with plates from Continental publications; for instance, the splendid plates from Icones Biblicae invented and engraved by Jan Van Luyken (1722 and 1723) were added to a copy (now in Chicago: BS185 f 1717a) of The Holy Bible (Oxford: John Baskett, 1716-17), to a copy (now in Bodley) of The Holy Bible (London: John Baskett, And the Assigns of Thomas Newcomb and Henry Hills, deceas'd, 1722-23) and to a copy (now in the Huntington) of The Holy Bible (Cambridge: Printed by Joseph Bentham; London: Sold by Benjamin Dod, 1762) (see Plate 3). Notice that all these illustrations for English Bibles were printed on the Continent. Beginning in the late seventeenth century, a number of suites of plates were published separately but were intended to be added to the undecorated English Bibles published by the Bible patentees. The earliest of these probably originated on the Continent, but by 1672 English publishers had recognized the profits to be won and began printing separate suites of illustrations of the Bible. The emphasis was always on the narrative sections, 8 the Death of Abel or The Finding of Moses in the Bullrushes or the Birth of Christ, rather than on the more poetical books such as Job and the Psalms. And it was apparently assumed that the plates would actually be added to copies of the Bible rather than being studied or enjoyed by themselves. For instance, The Holy Bible in Sculpture was "Printed for Moses Pitt at the Angel in St. Pauls Church yard 1683 At whose said Shop Bibles Testaments and Common-Prayers in all Volumes are to be sold that are printed at the Theater in Oxford [i.e., the Clarendon Press]", and Boydell's Illustrations of Holy Writ (1813) was said on the title-page to be "Calculated to Ornament All Quarto and Octavo Editions of the Bible, and Sold in Parts without The Text". New suites of illustrations intended to be added to the English text of the Bible were created for over fifty years, from 1671 to 1728. 9 After that there is a long pause, and the next new separate suite of Bible illustrations was published in 1786. The later suites are often very specialized in their purposes, "for hanging up in Nurseries" (1786) or to illustrate "Natural Science, Customs, Manners, &amp;c" (1802) or to exhibit Scripture Costume (1819) or Medals, Illustrative of the Holy Scriptures (1830). The reason why the fashion for separately-published suites of Bible illustrations faded away is fairly plain: it became possible to print integral illustrations to the King James translation of the Holy Bible without being sued by the patent-holders, and this of course was far more profitable than issuing the prints alone. Early in the eighteenth century there was apparently a change in the understanding of the nature of the perpetual Crown copyright in the King James translation of the Bible. Up to 1715, all the illustrated editions of the King James Translation of the Bible were published by the patent-holders, but thereafter scores of illustrated editions of the King James translation were published by booksellers who had no sort of claim on the copyright and who apparently made no financial or legal arrangement with the patent-holders. This circumvention of the copyright may have originated in the illustrated editions in folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, and sexto-decimo of the enormously popular Histoire de la Sainte Bible by the Sieur de Royaumont 10 which was published in French in 1670 (twice), 1680, 1683, 1686, 1687, 1688, 1691, 1697, 1698, 1699, 1701, 1702, 1712, 1713 (twice), 1717, 1719, 1721, 1727, 1735, 1764, 1766, 1770, 1774, 1782, 1802, 1804, 1810 (called La Bible de la Jeunesse ), 1811, 1812, 1815, 1817, 1818 . . .; in Dutch in 1739; and in Portuguese in 1791. The brilliant innovation consists in printing the text of the Bible in order to explain its history. Royaumont's work has an equal number of text-pages and of prints; the text-page is a summary of an action in the Bible which is depicted on the facing plate. In England, the Sieur de Royaumont's work was translated into English as: 1688 The History of the New Testament , tr. J. Raynor 2° 1690 The History of the Old Testament , tr. McCoughen 2° 1690 The History of the New Testament , tr. Samuel Royscroft 2° 1691 The History of the Old and New Testament (Second Edition) 8° 1699 The History of the Old and New Testament (Second Edition, Corrected) 4° 1700, 1701 The History of the Old and New Testament (Second Edition, Corrected and Enlarged) 2° 1703 The History of the Old and New Testament (Third Edition) 4° 1705 The History of the Old and New Testament (Third Impression) 2° 1711 The History of the Old and New Testament (Fourth Edition) 4° 1712 The History of the Old and New Testament (Fourth Impression) 2° 1780 An Abridgement of The History of the Old and New Testament , tr. J. Reeve 12° 1815 Joseph Reeve [actually the translator], The History of the Holy Bible (Fifth Edition) 8° 1826 Joseph Reeve, The History of the Holy Bible (Sixth Edition) 8° The device of a History of the Bible incorporating the text of the Bible could readily be imitated, and the financial temptations to English booksellers were clearly irresistible. There were illustrated editions, usually in folio, called, with minor variants, The History of the Holy Bible —by Samuel Wesley (in verse, 1704 ff), an anonymous writer (1716 ff), Laurence Howell (1716 ff), J. Hamond (1727 ff), Thomas Stackhouse (1733 ff), S. Smith (1735 ff), Laurence Clarke (1737), John Marchant (1761), John Fleetwood (1769 ff), and Edward Kimpton (1781). There were over fifty such editions from 1704 through 1781, and then the fashion dwindled away. 11 The device had demonstrated that, by making additions to the text of the Bible, it was possible to evade the copyright restrictions on the publication of the King James translation. The same thing was attempted in other works with titles which came closer and closer to "The Holy Bible". For instance, the text attributed to S. Smith was variously entitled The Family Companion . . . Being a New and Compleat History of the Old and New Testament (London: J. Wilford, 1735); The Compleat History of the Old and New Testament; or, A Family Bible (London: W. Rayner, 1735, 1737); and Family Companion or Annotations upon the Holy Bible (London: The Author, 1739). A large proportion of these illustrated versions of the King James translation were called The Family Bible , often with the addition of an adjective such as Complete (1761-62), Christian's (1763-67), Elegant (1765-67), Universal (1758-59), Royal (1761), Imperial (1811-14), or Evangelical (1811-14). And as the singular allure of "Christian's", "New", and "Universal" wore off, publishers increasingly tried to refurbish it by cramming in as many fashionable adjectives as possible, as in The Christian's New, Complete, and Universal Family Bible (1794) and The Royal Standard Devotional Family Bible (1812-14). By the end of the eighteenth century, a clear convention had developed with regard to the enforcement of the copyright in the King James Translation. The custom had grown up of permitting, or at least winking at, the publication of the King James translation by booksellers other than the patent-holders if they made significant additions or alterations to it, issuing it with learned notes, or Explained by Way of Question and Answer (1748), or with engravings. The situation was still so obscure late in the eighteenth century that Thomas Macklin felt he had to ask Oxford for permission to print the Authorised Version. According to the minutes of the meeting of the Delegates of Oxford University Press for Friday 29 January 1790, M r Macklin's application for leave to use the priviledge [ sic ] of the University Press, in printing a Bible in three large imperial 4° volumes, being taken into consideration, resolved, that the Board do not think proper to grant his Request, having no Precedent on their Books. . . . 12 Macklin's Bible was eventually printed in six (not three) volumes in folio (not large quarto) in 1793-1800 with enormously ambitious illustrations and with a very small number of notes printed so far down the page that they were often trimmed off. According to the "Case of the University of Oxford upon their Right of printing Bibles and common prayer &amp;. c " (concluding with a legal opinion of 13 April 1797), Very lately, when Macklin printed his Bible He applied to the university of Oxford for the use of their privilege and it was understood that a large Consideration might have been received for it: But the Delegates, not thinking themselves warranted to grant the Privilege whether with, or without compensation, for printing a Bible extra universitatem, Macklin had recourse (for Security) to printing such Notes as have been described, at the foot of the page. The convention was explained in 1802 by "John Reeves, Esq. One of the Patentees of the Office of King's Printer": all our authorized Bibles, published by the King's printer, and the Universities, are wholly without explanatory notes. 13 These privileged persons have confined themselves to reprinting the bare text, in which they have an exclusive right; forbearing to publish it with notes, 14 which, it is deemed, may be done by any of the King's subjects as well as themselves. 15 In general, works which called themselves merely The Bible or The Holy Bible were printed for the copyright-holders; other titles demonstrate the ingenuity with which this copyright was evaded. The most ingenious or devious form of evasion was in The Holy Bible (London: Printed by J. W. Pasham, 1776) uniformly with five lines (3/8") of "NOTES" on each oddly-tall duodecimo leaf. The work was printed with notes, thus adhering to the convention for Bibles printed by those who did not hold a patent, but the notes were normally trimmed off by the binder, 16 so that it was sold as a naked Bible, scarcely distinguishable from copyright Bibles except in its publisher. 17 Reeves protested at what he called this pretence of notes, which I have seen in some editions of the Bible and Common Prayer, placed there merely as a cover to the piracy of printing upon the patentees, as if fraud could make legal any thing that was in itself illegal. In some of these editions the notes are placed purposely so as to be cut off by the binder. 18 However, through a generous toleration, or a timorous uncertainty as to the enforceability of the patent, neither Reeves nor the other patent-holders challenged the practice in the courts. The separately published suites of Bible illustrations are rarely to be found today in their separate state, even though they were issued with their own title-pages, often undated. Instead, they are usually found bound with undecorated Bibles of a somewhat later date. Since the illustrations and their title-page were entirely engraved on copper, with no type-set text at all, it was easy to print them again whenever they were needed, and a few of these suites of prints seem to have been issued, probably reprinted, over periods of fifty to seventy-five years. The separate suites of prints never originated with a Bible patent-holder, but each suite of prints was usually bound with Bibles published by the same Bible patent-holder. It seems likely that the suites of prints and the unillustrated Bible text were often bought at the same time from the same bookseller, perhaps even from the patent-holder, 19 though the dates of the Bibles and of the suites of Bible-illustrations rarely coincide. For instance, the Cole plates published by Ware (c. 1715) were added to Bibles of 1715-63 published by the Basketts, and in one Bible (1726) they are accompanied by a portrait (published by Ware) of George II who did not begin his reign until the next year. There was a symbiotic relationship between the publisher of the prints and the publisher of the Bible, and it was in the interest of each to foster the publication of the other. Since the text and illustrations were printed by different printers, and since the purchaser could choose whether to illustrate his Bible and which illustrations to buy, each copy of the Bible with separately published illustrations is, in effect, unique. There are, of course, patterns of choice related to what the bookseller had to offer; for instance, Sturt's plates are generally found in Bibles published by the Basketts. However, the choice seems to have been up to the purchaser, and the combinations of Bible editions and separate illustrations are remarkably various. The list below records the chief separately published suites of Bible illustrations intended at least in part for an English market. 20 I presume that the date on the Bible indicates the approximate date of purchase (or at least the terminus a quo) of both the Bible and the suite of prints and that the two separate publications were bound together on the directions of the purchaser rather than for the bookseller. At least up to 1826, in England the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament were apparently invariably printed as separate units, each with its discrete signatures and (usually) title-page. A bookseller would ordinarily deal with only one Bible-patent-holder, but he usually had stacks of different testaments (Old, Apocryphal, New), different sizes (folio to duodecimo), and different dates (say, 1672, 1675, 1680, 1682) which he could offer to customers. It might be a matter of chance whether a customer wanting, say, a whole quarto Bible was given Testaments all from the same year or from several years. In the Bibles described below, a duplication of dates normally indicates that the several title-pages bear more than one date, the earlier one generally that in the Old Testament. Note also that by "Bible" I mean the Old and the New Testament together and that I usually do not record the presence or absence of the Apocrypha. The Book of Common Prayer was often bound with copies of the Bible printed by the same publisher, but I ignore these unless they help to date other works within the same covers. The Bibles in English here are all of the King James translation. 1.

But they found themselves cruelly frustrated when they confronted the New Testament.

The imprint in The Book of Common Prayer continues: "A Curious Set of Cuts for all Sorts of House Bibles Engrav'd by I. Sturt to which is added Six Maps of Sacred Geography . . . ." 23 The most prolific English Bible-illustrator of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was probably John Sturt, who made a number of suites of biblical engravings. The Sturt plates are quite distinct from those of Cole (above)—for one thing, they are larger—though some designs are very similar. For instance, in Eve taken from the side of Adam for Genesis ii, the dogs at the bottom and the elk at the left are identical, though in the Cole version the lion, birds, rabbit, horse, trees, &amp;c., are distinctly different. (i) The first of these Sturt engravings was probably the suite of over 330 plates—180 for the Old Testament and 152 for the New Testament, plus title-pages—which were printed integrally with the text, on the same octavo pages as the poetry, in Samuel Wesley, The History of the Old Testament in Verse with One Hundred and Eighty Sculptures . . . The Cuts done By J. Sturt (London: Cha. Harper, 1704)—Vol. II is called The History of the Holy Bible (n.d.); 24 The History of the Old and New Testament Attempted in Verse: And adorn'd with Three Hundred &amp; Thirty Sculptures . . . The Cuts done by J. Sturt (London: John Hooke, 1716; 25 the New Testament title-page of 1721 gives the publisher as C. Harper); The History of the New Testament . . . Attempted in Verse, And Adorn'd with CLII Sculptures The Cuts done by J. Sturt The Third Edition (London: Thomas Ward, 1717). (ii) These 330-some octavo plates of c. 1704 are distinct from Sturt's 150 octavo plates of c. 1715 which appeared in Laurence Howell, A Complete History of The Holy Bible . . . Adorn'd with above 150 Cuts, engraven by J. Sturt In Three Volumes ([London:] E. Nutt &amp; J. Sturt, 1716). 26 Many of the Howell plates are reprinted integrally in J. Hamond, An Historical Narration of the Whole Bible . . . curiously adorn'd with proper Cuts engraven by Mr. John Sturt (London: R. Ware, 1717; 1723; 1727; 27 1749), both octavo; the 1749 plates bear references to the Hamond text. These plates for Wesley (1704 ff) and for Howell (1716 ff) and Hamond (1717 ff) are quite distinct from The Historical Part of the Holy Bible 28 —see below. Sturt also engraved whole suites of plates for The Book of Common Prayer, The Orthodox Communicant , and Sacred Geography (1725—see below) as well as title-pages for The Holy Bible for Moses Pitt (1683, quarto—called The Holy Bible in Sculpture ) and for Charles Bill and the Executrix of Thomas Newcomb (1701, folio; 1706, quarto). His suite of separate plates for the Bible was called: 9. The Historical Part of the Holy Bible, or the Old and New Testament Exquisitely and Accurately describ'd in near Three Hundred Historys Engraven by John Sturt, From Designs of the Greatest Masters ([London:] Sold by Rich d Ware at the Bible and Sun in Amen Corner; all sorts of Bibles and Common Prayers, Adorn'd w th M r Sturts fine Cutts, his Engrav'd Common Prayer, and Orthodox Communicant, etc. [c. 1722]) Sturt's plates for The Historical Part of the Holy Bible were in progress by the time those for Howell's book were published in 1716, for an advertisement in Volume I of that work announced: "There is likewise a new Set of Cuts for the Holy Bible and Common Prayer in Folio, Quarto , and Octavo 29 near finish'd by the said Mr. Sturt, and will be publish'd in a short Time." They were bound with Bibles of 1722 onwards, and they had certainly appeared by 1727, when "A Catalogue of Books: Sold by R. Ware, at the Bible and Sun in Amen Corner", in Hamond's Historical Narration (London: Ware, 1727), offered " A curious Set of Bible Cuts; containing near 300 Histories, adapted to Folio and Quarto Bibles Engrav'd by Mr John Sturt, from the Designs of the greatest Masters". The good plates are octavo size and were printed one to a page in the octavo editions, two to a page above an ornament in quarto editions (see Plate 8), 30 and four to a page above a vignette in folio editions. Sturt's Historical Part plates are four times the size of those in Wesley. Some are essentially the same as in Wesley (e.g., Genesis xviii, 10-15, Jacob's Ladder), but many are quite different (e.g., Genesis iv, 2-8, Cain and Abel). The imprint on the copperplate for the title of The Historical Part of the Holy Bible was slightly altered over the years. In the copy of the title-page with the 1775-76 Bible (below), Ware's name and address (but not the list of what he sold) was changed to Fielding &amp; Walker (n.d.), and some of the plates are similarly altered; and on the title-page with the 1777 Bible (below) the bookseller's name is given as W. Dawson (n.d.). Sets of Sturt's plates for The Historical Part of the Holy Bible are associated with The Holy Bible published chiefly by the Basketts: 1722, 1723 (London: Baskett) &lt;Bible Society 31 &gt; 2° 1722, 1723 with Sturt's Sacred Geography (London: R.

There are also 206 vignettes, a few of which are fine; some are as much as 7" x 4", larger than the full-page plates in some Bibles, and about half (101) are after Picart.

There are 27 numbered plates for the Old Testament, though the text below calls for 31. (The text mentions a companion volume called A Series of Prints of the New Testament .) Another companion volume by Mrs Trimmer was entitled: A Description of a Set of Prints of Scripture [Old Testament] History: contained in A Set of Easy Lessons (London: John Marshall [1786]) &lt;British Library: 03128 e 7&gt;.

Scripture Illustrated by Means of Engravings referring to Natural Science, Customs, Manners, &amp;c . (London: C. Taylor, 1802) This too is a remarkably fugitive work, and in fact I have seen no copy; my information comes from Lowndes. 38 There are also said to be editions of 1803 and 1814. Presumably such prints today survive chiefly distributed through extra-illustrated Bibles with no title-page to indicate their source. 15. Scripture Illustrated; or, A Series of Engravings, taken from the Old and New Testament: Designed by W.M. Craig, Esq. and cut in wood by Bewick, C. &amp; J.

There is a "Description of the Plates" but, of course, no biblical text. The plates are of indifferent quality and are much smaller than quarto size, with wide white margins (see Plate 15). 19.

These works are not really illustrated Bibles but are separate suites of illustrations designed to be combined with separately-printed Bibles. In a few works with "biblical" text, the illustrations are the raison d'etre of the publication. One such work is: [Elisha Coles] Nolens Volens: or, You shall make Latin whether you will or no; Containing the Plainest Directions That have yet been given on that Subject. Together with The Youths Visible Bible: Being an Alphabetical Collection (from the whole Bible) of such General Heads as were judg'd most capable of Hieroglyphicks Illustrated (with great Variety) in Four and Twenty Copper Plates; with the Rude Translation opposite, for the exercise of those that begin to make Latin. The Third Edition (London: T. Basset, and H. Brome, 1675) 8° (There were also editions in 1677 and 1682.) The Youths Visible Bible on pp. 1-156 consists of woodcuts with twelve simple designs (e.g., on the first, Adder, Adversitie, Ants, Age, Almes, Alter, Apples, Arrows, Ark, Asp, Ass, Ax) followed by six pages of parallel passages from the Bible, English on the left, citation in the middle, Latin on the right (see Plate 17). A somewhat similar work was: A Curious Hieroglyphic Bible; or, Select Passages in the Old and New Testaments, Represented with Emblematical Figures, for the Amusement of Youth: Designed Chiefly to familiarize tender Age, in a pleasing and diverting Manner, with early Ideas of the Holy Scriptures. To which are subjoined, A Short Account of the Lives of the Evangelists, and other Pieces, illustrated with Cuts. The Thirteenth Edition (London: Robert Bassam [by Assignment from the Executors of T. Hodgson], H. D. Symonds, Scatcherd &amp; Whitaker, 1795) Price One Shilling Bound. 12° The work is remarkably fugitive, not to say silly. I have seen very few copies, but, as they were entirely printed from woodcuts, they were unlikely to change much from edition to edition except in the title-page. It consists of 126-134 pages with three to four woodcuts per page, crude pictures doing duty for words—e.g., "And the Lord [cartouche with Hebrew IHVH] formed [cartouche of a naked horizontal man]" (p. 4). It was clearly a valuable property, repeatedly reprinted, in at least these forms: 1784 2nd Edition &lt;British Library&gt; 1785 2nd Edition 1785 3rd Edition &lt;British Library&gt; 1786 4th Edition &lt;British Library&gt; 1787 5th Edition &lt;Bible Society&gt; 1788 6th Edition &lt;British Library&gt; 1789 Dublin 1790 8th Edition &lt;Bodley&gt; 1791 9th Edition &lt;British Library&gt; 1792 10th Edition 1792 11th Edition &lt;Bodley, Victoria&gt; 1794 13th Edition 1795 13th Edition &lt;Bible Society&gt; 1796 13th Edition &lt;Bodley&gt; 1812 20th Edition 39 The first eleven London editions were published by Thomas Hodgson, the rest by Robert Bassam. The re-establishment of the tradition of printed Bible-illustration in England was a slow and somewhat devious process, and the tension between Puritans, the King's Printer, and the iconophiles was only gradually relaxed. Apparently it was the development of two innovations which made the relaxation possible or at least acceptable. The first was the idea of separate suites of Bible illustrations which could be combined with the printed Bible at the inclination of the purchaser, and the second was the concept that a Bible which is something more than the King James Translation, with notes or illustrations, was not governed by the Crown patent in the King James Translation. There were, of course, suites of separate English Bible prints after 1830, 40 but the climax of accomplishment in Bible printing and illustration in England was the magnificent Macklin Bible "Embellished with Engravings, from Pictures and Designs by the Most Eminent English Artists" first published in folio Parts in 1791-1800, expanded with the addition of the Apocrypha in 1816, and re-issued in 1816-24 (see Plate 18). Its only rival was the suite of Illustrations of the Book of Job which William Blake designed, engraved, and published in 1826 (see Plate 19). For imaginative ambition, heroic size, dignity, sophistication of engraving, and quality of designs, nothing like them by English artists, engravers, and printers had appeared in England before or would appear again. After 1800, the focus of English Bible illustration frequently shifted from divine and heroic events to biblical (that is to say, oriental) landscape and geography and topography and natural science and costume and customs. From 1549 to 1830 artistic and legal innovation and accomplishment in English Bible illustration flourished vigorously, but by about 1800 most of the changes had been rung. By 1830 the heroic days of English biblical martyrs, iconoclastic Puritans, and publishing pirates had largely passed.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Part of the research for this essay was done in 1989 while I was a Harold White Fellow of the National Library of Australia, for whose friendly staff and generous facilities my wife and I are very grateful. The substance of the essay was given in a lecture entitled "Puritans and Pirates" delivered at the Annual General Meeting of the Oxford Bibliographical Society in April 1993. I am grateful for much advice concerning English illustrated Bibles, particularly from Elizabeth M. Ingram, B. J. McMullin, and Catherine Delano-Smith. 1 The first complete (though unauthorized) English Bible is Biblia: The Byble [tr. Miles Coverdale] ([?Cologne: ?E. Cervicornus &amp; J. Soter,] 1535) which is illustrated with 63 small, anonymous woodcuts mostly copied from those by Hans Sebald Beham in Biblische Historien (Frankfort, 1533). The scene of St Paul writing heads all his epistles. It was reprinted as Biblia: The byble . . . truly and purely translated into Englysch by Thomas Matthew [i.e., Coverdale and Tyndale] ([Antwerp: Printed by M. Crom for Richard Grafton &amp; Edward Whitchurch,] 1537) with 69 woodblocks, mostly c. 2" x 2" (copying those by Beham), first used in Storys and prophesis out of the Holy Scriptur, garnyschede wiih faire ymages, and with deuoute praeirs [by Nicholas Coppyn] [tr. from the Dutch] (Andwarpe: Simon Cowke, 1536), plus many large initials of Death and the Jester. 2 See James Strachan, Early Bible Illustrations: A Short Study of Some Fifteenth and Early Sixteenth Century Printed Texts (1957), which focuses upon the pictorial antecedents of Henry VIII's Great Bible. 3 See the Appendix, "Separate Bible Illustrations Printed on the Continent 1529-1802." 4 Some publishers were willing to print their plates in a variety of sizes for binding with Bibles in different formats. For instance, in the imprint of his Histoire Sacrée (1728), M. de Marne said: "Il fournira les même 500 Planches sur telle grandeur de papier que l'on souhattera"; the copy I have seen (British Library: 7 c 3-5) has two octavo-size prints on a quarto-size leaf. 5 An image of the deity designed by Virgil Solis in a Dutch Bible (Cologne, 1566) was replaced by the Hebrew letters JHVH when the same woodcuts were reprinted in the Bishops' Bible (London, 1568) (according to Colin Clair, "The Bishops' Bible 1568", Gutenberg Jahrbuch [1962], 289). 6 See B. J. McMullin, "Towards a Bibliography of the Oxford and Cambridge University Bible Presses in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 17.2 (1991), 51-71. 7 Note that apparently the only significant illustrated editions of the English Bible between 1611 and 1659 were those published in London by Robert Barker in 1611 and 1616 and the Geneva Bible published in Amsterdam by Thomas Stafford in 1640 and 1644, all in folio. 8 Several were called The Historical Part of the Holy Bible . 9 Their popularity lasted another half-century, for I have found them in Bibles published as late as 1783. 10 The author's name is given variously as le Sieur de Royaumont and Monsieur le Maitre de Sacy (1713) and even, mendaciously in English versions of 1815 and 1826, as Joseph Reeves (the translator), but it apparently should be Nicholas Fontaine. 11 There were new editions of these histories of the Bible, but no new history appeared. 12 "Orders of the Delegates of the Press" (1757 ff), p. 265, in Oxford University Press archives (like the next two documents quoted). Macklin may have applied to Oxford, rather than to the King's printer in London, because his printer Thomas Bensley was one of Oxford's two "Partners in the Bible trade" (according to the "Minutes of the Committee appointed by the Delegates of the Press for conferring with the Partners in the Bible trade"). 13 However, there are a few notes in this edition, both at the feet of the pages and at the back, and other editions by the patentees are similar. 14 Certainly the patentees occasionally published illustrated editions, such as John Field's great Holy Bible of 1659-60 and John Baskett's equally ambitious Holy Bible of 1716-17. 15 The Holy Bible (London: John Reeves, George and William Nicol, 1802), I, ix-x. 16 They are still present in Huntington: 112380 and in my own copy. 17 The device was not, however, new, for, according to the "Account of our [i.e., Oxford University Press] hearing before the King and Council 16 January 1679/80 upon a Complaint of the King's printers of Bibles against the University of Oxford and their printer for printing Bibles and Testaments in small volumes [i.e., in formats smaller than quarto, to which the King's Printer claimed the exclusive right]" (MS in Oxford University Press archives), the London copyright holders claimed that the printers "at Oxford . . . print a Bible in Quarto; and so order it that the Marginal Notes in some of the Copies being left out, if in those the Margin be cut close away, they will not be much larger than a large octavo (and these be those which the London printers complain of as being pretended to be Quartos but being really octavos)". This practice, apparently not denied by Oxford, implies Oxford's recognition at the time that their copyright was only for large-format (i.e., learned) Bibles. However, in later years Oxford printed small-format Bibles without challenge. The 1680 petition was dismissed by the King and Council on the grounds that the case ought to be decided at law, and "Since 1685 no attempt has been made by the Stationers' Company or the King's Printer or any other person to question the authority of the University to print Bibles and all books of every description" (Anonymous summary "Of the Privilege of the University of Oxford to Print Bibles" [Privately printed for the Delegates of the Clarendon Press, January 11, 1898; "Proof" in Oxford University Press archives]). 18 The Holy Bible (1802), I, x footnote. 19 However, Moses Pitt advertised in the imprint of The Holy Bible in Sculpture (1683) that at his "said Shop Bibles . . . are to be sold that are printed at the Theater in Oxford [i.e., the Clarendon Press]," indicating that it was the print-publisher who specialized in the University Printer's Bibles rather than the University Printer who specialized in Pitt's Bible illustrations. 20 In the account of copies, the location symbols are as follows: Australia National Library of Australia (Canberra, Australia) Bible Society British and Foreign Bible Society, now housed in Cambridge University Library (Cambridge, England) Bodley Bodleian Library (Oxford, England) British Library British Library (London, England) British Museum Print Room Department of Prints and Drawings, British Museum (London, England) California University of California (Los Angeles, U.S.A.)

H. Darlow &amp; H. F. Moule, Historical Catalogue of Printed Editions of the English Bible 1525-1961 rev. A. S. Herbert (1968) lists (with very irregular attention to the engravings) "every edition [of the Bible] down to 1824" (p. xvii) plus new editions (omitting reprints) thereafter in the British and Foreign Bible Society supplemented with many holdings of the British Library and the American Bible Society. I have also worked in the American Bible Society but found there no relevant work which I had not previously seen. 21 There were a number of very distinguished engravers named Visscher, and the name appeared in various forms. For instance, Nicholas Visscher is the same as Claes Jansz Visscher and Nicolao Iohannis Piscator. He is apparently responsible for Theatrum Passionis et Mortis Domini ac Servatoris Nostri Iesu Christi (no imprint), with the 1701 Holy Bible below, and for Theatrum Biblicum (Amsterdam, 1674), which I have not seen. 22 The Bible &amp; Sun is at Amen Corner on the Bible title-page with the 1726 Bible (Victoria), but it was altered to Ludgate Hill on the title-pages of The Holy Bible and The Book of Common Prayer with the 1758 Bible (Chicago). The versions in Bibles of 1733 (Bible Society) and 1756 (Bible Society) bear the name of Sturt as the engraver of the Ware Bible title-page. 23 Catherine Delano-Smith, "Maps in Bibles in the Sixteenth Century", Map Collector (June 1987), 2-15, remarks that Latin Bibles, from the first illustrated one in 1455, generally omitted maps, that the first Bible with a printed map did not appear until 1525, and that maps, particularly realistic rather than emblematical ones, were associated with reformist zeal. 24 The Bodley copy of Wesley's Old Testament of 1704 (which bears the signature of "Charles Harper", the publisher) contains only the Old Testament, but it has an engraved title-page for The Old and New Testament (as in 1716, 1721 below) published by C. Harper in 1704 and a half-title (on Ww2) for The Historical Cuts of the Books call'd Apocrypha, Which having been usually admitted into these Collections, are only presented with their several Stories [?i.e., engravings]; the same are denied any Place in the Sacred Canon. 25 The sheets of John Hooke's 1716 Old Testament are the same as Charles Harper's of 1704, including the Errata, the lists of Harper's books, the engraved title-page to Vol. II with Harper's name as publisher, and the now-irrelevant dedication to Queen Anne (d. 1714). 26 There was a Third Edition in 1718, a Fourth Edition in 1725 (published by E. &amp; R. Nutt and J. Hooke, inter alia), a Fifth Edition in 1729, a Sixth Edition in 1752, and much later editions of London (1806-7) and of Philadelphia (1806; 1807; 1807-8). 27 The Bodley copy (Montagu 208) lacks the Sturt plates, but they are present in the British Library copies &lt;3129 d 27 and 1490 b 3&gt;. 28 I compared the Howell plates with those in The Historical Part of the Holy Bible bound with the 1765 Holy Bible (see below). 29 I take it that " Folio ", " Quarto ", and " Octavo " here refer to the size of the paper rather than to the size of the engravings. For instance, in The Holy Bible of 1722-23, there are four of Sturt's octavo-size designs on each folio page. 30 The ornaments in the copy with The Holy Bible (1765) are newly engraved. 31 I have not seen the 1722-23 Bible, and it is reported here only on the authority of Darlow &amp; Moule, no. 965. 32 The copy of the 1765 Baskett quarto Bible in New South Wales &lt;Q220-/1A1&gt; bears the bookplate of Captain Cook and 93 quite different prints. 33 A work called Sacred Geography was also published by Joseph Moxon in 1671 and 1691. 34 I have records of the following Richard Ware Sacred Geography title-pages: 35 See Catherine Delano-Smith &amp; Elizabeth M. Ingram, Maps in Bibles in the British Library, Finding List: 1500-1600 (Nottingham: University of Nottingham, 1988), for extraordinarily detailed information about maps in early Bibles, including which blocks were used in each Bible and whence and where each was copied. They show that, among the sixteenth-century Bibles in the British Library, there were maps in over half (54%) of the English Bibles, in somewhat less than half of the Dutch (42%), French (21%), and German (31%) Bibles, but in less than 3% of those in Latin (p. 21). Almost all the maps in British sixteenth-century Bibles listed there represent (1) Eden, (2) Exodus, (3) Canaan, (4) the Holy Land, and (5) the Eastern Mediterranean. 36 I know the Bible Society copy only through Darlow &amp; Moule, no. 965. 37 In the same volume is a frontispiece (Ludovicus Dempsy Dublini, 1735) and four anonymous double-page maps published by George Grierson; apparently this is the evidence on which the British Library dated The Historical Part in 1735. However, these plates were evidently first issued independently of both The Holy Bible (1740) and The Historical Part (n.d.), and the presence of the three works within the same covers probably indicates little about the date of The Historical Part . 38 It is advertised in Calmet's Great Dictionary of the Holy Bible . . .

A. Clouston, Hieroglyphic Bibles: their origin and history (1894), 8-10, and Darlow &amp; Moule, no. 1299. 40 Some of the more notable suites of English Bible illustrations from 1831 to 1850 were: 1833 John Landseer, A Series of Engravings, illustrating . . .

[?1837] &lt;Huntington&gt; 41 According to Colin Clair, "The Bishops' Bible 1568", Gutenberg Jahrbuch (1962), 287-290, the Solis wood engravings appeared in the folio Lutheran Bible (Franckfurt: David Zopfel, Johann Rasch, Sigmund Feyerabend, 1560) and were copied in the woodcuts first printed in a Dutch Bible (Cologne: The Heirs of Arnold Birckman, 1566), reprinted in England in the folio Bishops' Bible (1568), and again in the folio Biblia Latina (Antwerp: The Widow and Heirs of Jan Steels): "Thus we have the curious instance of a whole series of wood engravings being used to illustrate in turn a German Lutheran Bible, a Dutch Bible, an English Episcopalian Bible, and the Latin Vulgate!" (p. 288). 42 The Holy Bible (London: John Baskett, And the Assigns of Thomas Newcomb and Henry Hills, deceas'd, 1722, 1723) in Bodley (Bib Eng 1723 b 2), extra-illustrated with prints from this work, was evidently the Mortier family Bible. Facing the manuscript Table of Cuts in Vol. I are details of [name cut off] Mortier (born 25 Nov. 1673 in Amsterdam) who married Esther North (b. 1692) on 12 May 1709 and of their children born in London (1711 and 1721 [buried in Chelsey in 1722]) and in Amsterdam (1712 [christened at the Episcopal Church], 1713, 1714 [Peter (sic), buried in Amsterdam in 1719], and 1716 [died in Amsterdam in 1718]). Apparently the family was in Amsterdam in 1712-19 and in London in 1709, 1711, and 1722.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare's Art and the Texts of King Lear by Ann R. Meyer *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The earliest known texts of King Lear exist in essentially two different forms, the 1608 First Quarto (Q) and the 1623 Folio edition (F). 1 Until recently editors interested in preparing critical editions of King Lear attempted to reconstruct a text that reflected the author's intentions more accurately than either surviving text. Editors drew on physical evidence from both texts for assistance when emending errors and when trying to distinguish between authorial and non-authorial alterations. Traditional editorial practice included the consolidation of variant readings from the separate texts if, after examining the physical evidence of those texts, an editor concluded that a judicious consolidation would further the attempt to recover Shakespeare's work. Much of the textual scholarship on King Lear in the last decade, however, has advocated a presentation of two different versions, rather than a consolidation of the early texts. 2 Gary Taylor, Michael Warren, Stanley Wells and others have argued that Q and F are not defective versions of a lost text, but "two separate and successive stages in the creation of King Lear " ( Division v). Q "represents the play as Shakespeare originally wrote it," but having discerned its theatrical shortcomings he "substantially revised it" ( CW 1027). 3 The final version is the theatrically superior Folio Lear . In order to "preserve the separate integrity" of each text, the editors of the Oxford Shakespeare present two versions of King Lear with original spelling and punctuation, one based on the First Quarto and the other based on the Folio text ( TC 510). The Oxford editors do not include a consolidated King Lear in The Complete Works since, as Stanley Wells argues, "conflation muddies our understanding of Shakespeare's artistry" ( Division 17-19). It is my view, however, that conflation on the one hand and a presentation of different versions on the other are not mutually exclusive alternatives. All texts, particularly dramatic ones, are the products of many influences, authorial and non-authorial. In the case of the Lear texts, editors have focused primarily on contributions from the author, the printing-house, and the theater. If an editor's aim is to distinguish authorial material from non-authorial material and then construct one or more critical texts that come closest to Shakespeare's, then, I will argue, a judicious consolidation of major passages from both early texts is still necessary, if those passages show evidence of non-authorial influence. 4 Comparison of readings between Q and F shows that some of the most problematic variants occur in the central and final acts. In this essay I will call attention to sources of non-authorial alterations in these portions of the texts in order to demonstrate why it is necessary for editors to draw on and sometimes consolidate readings from both texts of King Lear when trying to construct an authorial edition. First, I will examine two press variants in sheet G of the First Quarto (sheet G corresponds to III.iii. through III.vii. in Folio Lear ). Second, I will argue for including both the Q version of III.vi. (Lear on the heath, including the mock trial) and the F version of V.iii. (the final moments of the play) in any edition of King Lear that is offered primarily as an attempt to recover Shakespeare's work. The presentation of separate texts by the Oxford editors is one way of attempting to recover the author's intentions and, as they have argued, it is the way that they think is most accurate historically. I will argue, however, that the Oxford editors do not fully account for the possibility of non-authorial influence in their treatment of the central and final acts, so that their presentations of these portions of the texts are more inaccurate than judicious consolidations of them. My call for consolidated presentations of certain readings from Q and F is not incompatible with the goal of trying to reconstruct the historical process of an author's work. 5 Whereas the Oxford editors argue that authorial revision is the primary source of alteration in these scenes, I direct attention to non-authorial influences that have contributed to what we find in the extant texts. My argument does not reinforce the concept of a "definitive" or ideal authorial text, nor does it contradict the concept of the text as a product of many influences, including the possibility of authorial revision. If an editor's attempt to establish an authorially intended text leads to discoveries about non-authorial influences, these discoveries do not rule out, of course, the possibility of authorial revision in other portions of the text or in other works by the same author. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The First Quarto was set seriatim and, as Peter Blayney has suggested, the miserable quality of the manuscript probably accounts for Nicholas Okes' departure from the "more customary," type-saving method of setting by formes, or casting off (184). The text required the imposition of twenty-one formes of type and consists of ten and a half sheets (188). Although Q does not include act and scene divisions, sheet G contains text that Folio Lear and all modern editions designate as III.iii. through III.vii. Sheet L includes the final act. My discussion of these portions of the texts will apply, then, to sheets G and L in First Quarto and the corresponding parts in Folio Lear . The twelve extant copies of the First Quarto differ among themselves in a number of readings. The outer forme of sheet G, for example, contains several press variants which indicate that at some point during its printing the press was stopped and the forme corrected. 7 There is evidence, however, that some "corrections" yield readings different from those that stood in Q's copy. An examination of two press variants in outer G indicates that a Folio reading need not be an authorial revision, but gives evidence of having been a restoration of an original reading. In short, what we find in F ought to have been in Q. A look now at these press variants in Q's sheet G will inform my subsequent analysis of larger passages by calling attention to sources of alteration other than authorial revision, and in so doing, call into question some of the editorial decisions generated by the two-text theory. Furthermore, an examination of these two press variants reveals patterns of misreadings by Q's compositor B and, therefore, provides notable evidence for approaching Q. An editor will often accept the corrected form of a reading unless there is evidence that the proof-reader failed to consult the manuscript copy or that certain "corrections" are, in fact, incorrect. During one of Lear's speeches on the heath, the uncorrected state of the forme (Qa) reads, "this crulentious storme" (Q: G1r). 8 The second, or "corrected," state (Qb) reads, "this tempestious storme" (Q: G1r). Virtually all modern editions, however, adopt the Folio reading, "this contentious storme" (F: rr3r; Riverside III.iv.6). While Qa's "crulentious" is obviously nonsense, Qb's "tempestious" is also incorrect; but what is of more importance, "crulentious" is a conceivable blunder for the "contentious" that later, and properly, appeared in F. Blayney has concluded that two compositors worked on the First Quarto: compositor B set the first half of the play prior to the Christmas holidays in 1607 and compositor C, an apprentice, worked with B to complete the play sometime in early January (85). C worked more slowly and with less competence than B, but misspellings, misreadings, and evidence of faulty memorization throughout Q indicate that B's compositorial ability was not much better than C's (185-187). One reasonable explanation for "crulentious" argues that compositor B, when setting type, read the "on" in "contentious" as "ru." A carelessly written "o" in secretary hand, open at the top, resembles a "u." And an Elizabethan secretary "r," with its many different forms, is often confused with "v" or "u" and, therefore, with "o." Conceivably, then, the manuscript "o" was misread as "r." Similarly, both a secretary "u" and a secretary "n" appear as two minims and are frequently indistinguishable from one another. Further, the downstroke of a secretary "l" curves not from left to right, but from right to left, and is terminated by a small spur to the left across the middle of the upstroke. Since a secretary "t" also contains a cross bar and was generally looped, "l" and "t" were commonly confused with one another (McKerrow 348). Anthony G. Petti, in English Literary Hands from Chaucer to Dryden , confirms such a possibility in his table that lists the letters most commonly confused with one another from the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries. He shows that the secretary "o," "v" and "r" were frequently mistaken for one another, that the secretary "t" and "l" resemble each other, and that minim confusion often made it impossible to distinguish between "m," "n" and "u" (31). With the Folio reading ("contentious") restoring the original word in Q's copy, compositor B's initial error in Qa's outer G ("crulentious") is seen to offer a closer reading of the copy than Qb's "correction" of "tempestious." The alteration in Qb needs no explanation other than a proof-reader's attempt to replace nonsense, the result of compositor B's misreading the manuscript when setting Qa. F's "contentious" need not, then, depend on Shakespeare's revision of Qb's "tempestious" to F's "contentious" for the simple reason that the underlying copy for Qa already contained, for one inclined to discover it, the identical word that stood in the copy for F. 9 In the Oxford edition of Q, Wells and Taylor correctly emend Qa's "crulentious" to F's "contentious" but do not explain their reasons for doing so. Usually, if a variant reading from one text makes reasonable sense, as does Qb's "tempestious," the Oxford editors retain that reading: "We have . . . attempted, as far as possible, to emend Q—where emendation seems desirable—as though F did not exist, seeking in every case the most plausible explanation of the apparent error, and the most economical restoration of sense" ( TC 510). But with their treatment of this press variant, the editors provide an example of why it is necessary to consult both texts and to reject a reading from the first one in favor of a reading from the second in order to restore an original reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II This example demonstrates a case in which the Oxford editors were willing to adopt a reading from F while editing Q, but their treatment of another miscorrection in outer G demonstrates an overly conservative editorial decision in defense of Q's integrity. A Folio reading is rejected and an uncorrected reading in Q is retained because Qa makes "local and contextual sense" ( TC 517). The uncorrected state of Q (Qa) reads, ". . . thou art the thing it selfe, vnaccom-/odated man, is no more but such a poore bare forked Animall / as thou art, off off you leadings, come on bee true." (Qa: G2r-G2v). In the corrected state of the forme (Qb), the last phrase reads, ". . . off off you lendings, come on" (Qb: G2v). Folio Lear renders the passage in the following manner: "Thou art the thing it selfe; vnaccommo-/dated man, is no more but such a poore, bare, forked A-/nimall as thou art. Off, off you Lendings: Come, vn-/button heere." (F: rr3v; Riverside III.iv.106-109). The proof-reader for Q corrected the impossible "leadings" in Qa to "lendings," and F retains that revision. With respect to Qb's "come on" G2v shows ample space at the end of the line for the compositors to insert type and complete the passage. This fact combined with the absence of terminal punctuation in Qb's reading suggests a partially completed correction. The proof-reader recognized the original error, but the correction was never carried out completely. In this case there are at least two explanations for why the original reading, which F undoubtedly preserves, was not restored during the correction of Qa. First, the proof-reader may not have been able to read his illegible copy and therefore failed to complete the correction. Or second, the compositor, failing to carry out the proof-reader's instructions for any number of reasons, simply left the phrase dangling. In Blayney's discussion of this press variant he observes: "It is possible that the proof-reader indicated something a little closer to the presumed reading of the copy (which almost certainly agreed in substance with 'unbutton,' although there is no evidence of 'heere' in the uncorrected Q) but that the compositor somehow forgot to insert it" (246). Usually an editor will remove errors and imperfections such as the one in question for which there is evidence that either a proof-reader or compositor is responsible. While the Oxford editors emend "leadings" to "lendings" in their edition of Q, they preserve Qa's uncorrected "come on bee true," arguing that "come on bee true" makes sense and "leadings" does not. The editors acknowledge their temptation to adopt F's reading, since Qb's dangling "come on" reveals an attempt to correct Qa's "come on bee true" and that this "correction" was instead left incomplete. They choose, however, not to emend Qa with F's "come vnbutton heere," explaining, (a) there is no indication that 'heere' stood in Q's copy; (b) if 'vnbutton' were the intended correction, then 'on' should also have been deleted; (c) the uncorrected reading makes local and contextual sense. Even if the press-corrector did consult the manuscript, and deciphered it more successfully than the compositor had, we have no way of knowing what he found there, and 'vnbutton heere' would hardly recommend itself as a palaeographically plausible conjecture, if it did not stand in F. . . . Even if we assume that Qa's 'bee true' was a simple misreading, possible emendations are many—and the error may not have been entirely palaeographical. ( TC 517) But the presence or absence of "heere" has no substantive bearing on the sense or significance of F's reading—which is the action of "come unbutton" and not the adverbial place of "heere"—and therefore does not support the decision to preserve Qa's "come on bee true." If one is setting out to edit an edition of Q—or any edition of King Lear —and since there are three different renditions of the passage in question, the first two (Qa and Qb) suggesting error, miscorrection, or an incomplete correction, it follows that one should consult F for additional information and, in this case, to restore the original, correct reading to Q. Equally important, the editors' claim that "'vnbutton heere' would hardly recommend itself to a palaeographically plausible conjecture, if it did not stand in F," cannot be supported. Written in a secretary hand, "come on bee true" and "come vnbutton" bear close similarity to one another. Paul Hammond identifies this similarity and challenges the Oxford editors on palaeographical grounds: It is true that 'vnbutton heere' is not a palaeographically plausible emendation for 'on bee true', but that is to misstate the case. Rather, 'vnbutton'—or, in a possible contemporary spelling, 'unbotone'—is a plausible and easy conjecture for 'on bee true'. It supposes that the compositor, struggling with a word which he could not recognize, read 'un' as 'on' (under the influence of the preceding word 'come', quite reasonable); read 'bo' as 'be' (which he then set as 'bee'); and read 'tone' as 'true': all perfectly easy errors. The 'tone' / 'true' error may be the least obvious, but at line 1954 Q reads 'true' where F has 'none', suggesting that Okes' compositor B (who set both lines) was quite capable of reading 'one' in his copy as 'rue' . . . . As for 'heere', it could have been omitted by Q as redundant in the light of what it had made of the phrase, or it could have been added in F. (103) What is especially remarkable is that with this argument come the second and third examples of a misreading by Okes' compositor B of "on" for "ru": first with "contentious" and "crulentious," second with "tone" and "true," and third, as Hammond points out, with "none" and "true." Combined, these examples serve as significant bibliographical evidence for approaching Q. 10 As with the previous example of "crulentious" and "contentious," then, evidence exists to suggest that Qa's "come on bee true" represents the compositor's close but erroneous interpretation of the original reading, "come vnbutton heere." Even if one argues that the textual authority of King Lear is divided between two texts, Q and F, these two press variants indicate that it is still necessary to assess each variant textually, bibliographically, and palaeographically, and when these investigations raise serious doubts concerning the authority of one reading, it follows that we rely on the alternate text for assistance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Let us turn now from compositorial misreadings of individual phrases in Q's sheet G to the matter of a large passage in that same sheet—one that was cut from the corresponding scene in F. Although quite a different matter textually, my essential argument is that what we find in one text—here, the mock trial in Q—belongs in the other text, F. The mock trial appears in Q on the inner forme of sheet G (G3v-G4r). Thirty-one lines of Q's trial do not exist in F (rr4r, III.vi). Unlike the First Quarto, which was set seriatim, Folio Lear was set by formes and in sixes, a method that sometimes resulted in textual disturbances as a result of imprecise casting-off. 11 In rr4r of F, however, there is no indication of crowded text or forced omissions on the page where the lines from Q's mock trial would appear had they not been cut. It has been widely accepted that printing house errors were not responsible for this omission; much recent scholarship on the Lear texts regards the cut as authorial. 12 Shakespeare omitted the thirty-one lines found in Q, as Gary Taylor argues, "to streamline the plot and increase the narrative momentum," thereby improving the play on stage ("The War in King Lear " 28). 13 But does their absence in F prove that Shakespeare made the cut? In his essay "The Folio Omission of the Mock Trial: Motives and Consequences," Roger Warren, arguing for authorial revision in this scene, addresses the issue from a literary and theatrical standpoint only ( Division 45-57). He claims (a) that the mock trial scene confuses the plot, (b) that its thematic function is incomprehensible to an audience, (c) that the scene is far too difficult for actors to perform successfully, and (d) that the one masterful performance of the trial which he has seen, namely Peter Brook's 1962 production at Stratford, does not "alter the general position that its difficulties usually defeat performers," and therefore should not be staged (55). In this line of argument that does not touch at all on textual and bibliographical evidence, Warren contends that Shakespeare is responsible for the omission—it being clear at least to Warren, if not to Peter Brook, that in the theater the mock trial begets nonsense and chaos. Such an argument cannot identify who omitted the passages in this scene. Warren simply dismisses the possibility that someone other than Shakespeare is responsible. Textual evidence suggests, however, that Shakespeare did not make the cut. At the opening of the scene in both texts, Kent informs Gloucester of Lear's altered state of mind: "All the pow'r of his wits have given way to / his impatience . . ." ( Riverside III.vi.4-5). 14 Kent's emphasis here on Lear's "impatience" prepares us for the King's performance during the trial (found in Q), namely his refusal to tolerate the iniquity of his daughters and his earnest yet unavailing attempt to enforce justice. In reply to the fool's riddle, "Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman / be a gentleman or a yeoman?" Lear answers, "A king, a king!" and in his next speech, augments this recognition of his own foolishness with a furious expression of his need to see the daughters punished: "To have a thousand with red burning spits / Come hizzing in upon 'em" ( Riverside III.vi.9-11, 15-16). This statement, together with the mock trial as it stands in Q, follows from Lear's earlier assertion to avenge himself on "those pelican daughters": No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both, That all the world shall—I will do such things— What they are yet I know not, but they shall be The terrors of the earth! ( Riverside II.iv.278-282) Following Lear's statement, "To have a thousand with red burning spits / Come hizzing in upon 'em," in Q we find thirty-one lines that do not exist in F. Only in Q does Lear attempt to enforce justice by devising the courtroom scene. Q reads: Lear . It shalbe done, I wil arraigne them straight, Come sit thou here most learned Iustice Thou sapient sir sit here, no you shee Foxes— (Q: G3v; Riverside III.iv.20-22) In Q Lear appoints poor Tom as his "most learned Iustice," the fool as his "yokefellow of equity," and begins the imaginary prosecution of the "shee Foxes." Disturbed and baffled by Lear's "reason in madness," Edgar responds, "Looke where he stands and glars, wanst thou eyes, at / tral [trial] madam . . ." (Q: G3v; Riverside III.vi.23-24). And in a line so typical of Kent, always devoted to the protection and service of his "King and master," he pleads, "How doe you sir? Stand you not so amazd, will you / lie downe and rest vpon the cushings?" (Q: G4r; Riverside III.vi.33-34). As always, Lear refuses Kent's assistance. He will see "their triall first," and he will begin with Goneril. The fool calls her to the imaginary bench to stand before the "honorable assembly" and initiates the interrogation: "is your name Gonorill?" She cannot answer, of course, for as the fool reminds us, she is inhuman—a mere "ioyne stoole." So Lear calls on Regan, "another whose warpt lookes proclaime, / What store her hart is made an . . ." (Q: G4r; Riverside III.vi.35, 46-54). It is at this moment, when Lear's insanity becomes indistinguishable from his insight, that Regan escapes him. Lear calls, . . . stop her there, Armes, armes, sword, fire, corruption in the place, False Iusticer why hast thou let her scape. (Q: G4r; Riverside III.vi.54-56) The trial in Q breaks with the King in an uproar, disgusted that his revelation of what is true and just will lead nowhere, frustrated by his inability to enforce justice upon people who have no humanity, outraged at those who stand by silently allowing corruption to pass unpunished, and all too aware that truth and justice in the world of this play must be expressed through fools and madmen. F contains none of this. After Lear's statement, "To have a thousand with red burning spits / Come hizzing in upon them," F picks up with Edgar's line, "Bless thy five wits!" ( Riverside III.vi.57). The next two speeches, spoken by Kent and Edgar, also appear in F even though the trial was removed from F: Kent . O pity! Sir, where is the patience now That you so oft have boasted to retain? Edg . [ Aside .] My tears begin to take his part so much, They mar my counterfeiting. ( Riverside III.vi.58-61) Although these lines are not entirely unmotivated in so far as Shakespeare focuses on suffering and madness throughout Act III, they are more powerfully motivated with the mock trial. In F, Edgar's tears especially seem to be an exaggerated response to Lear's reply to the fool's riddle, "Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman / be a gentleman, or a yeoman?" ( Riverside III.vi.9-10). In Q, the King's performance during the trial justifies Kent's statement to Gloucester at the scene's opening as well as the pity and fear Kent expresses here. And it is Edgar, disguised in nakedness and insanity, who can empathize with Lear's condition and "take his part so much." Perhaps of even more importance textually is the line that Lear speaks in both Q and F shortly after Kent and Edgar express concern for the King's health and sanity: "Then let them anatomize Regan; see what / breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature / that make these hard hearts?" ( Riverside III.vi.76-78). Surely the sensitive reader or audience of F hesitates and asks, "Then"? "Regan"? Why not also anatomize Goneril? Without the context of the earlier passages from the mock trial, Lear's exhortation creates a confusion—a stumble—that never occurs in Q. In the earlier text, Lear's words make good sense and follow logically from the preceding events. He had already interrogated Goneril, yet Regan had escaped. In keeping with his character, Lear refuses to tolerate this escape; he will not step down from authority. The King insists she be summoned for examination—or more correctly—anatomization. Moreover, Lear's emphasis here on the hardness of Regan's heart parallels his earlier statements during the trial and reinforces the metaphorical significance of the joint stools. Goneril and Regan have no humanity; they are inanimate objects. Without the mock trial as it is presented in Q, the significance of certain key passages remaining in F is greatly reduced, their effectiveness lost. Clearly, the decision to edit a text of King Lear without the thirty-one lines from Q raises questions: if Shakespeare cut these lines because the scene lacks clarity and coherence with them, why then did he not make further adjustments in the scene to effect a better transition; why did he not alter Kent's and Edgar's expressions to suit the scene with the omission? Why was the text not modified so that both daughters would be "anatomized?" As W. W. Greg observed, authorial revision entails more than simply removing words and passages: In many cases . . . it is impossible to distinguish between corruption on the one hand or revision on the other, but I question whether this is always, or even generally so. Where one reading is metrical and the other not; where in one the thought receives natural expression, in the other forced or inept; or where one shows a misunderstanding of the sense that is clear in the other, we have, I think, good and sufficient ground for judging. ("The Function of Bibliography in Literary Criticism" 255) However relevant the omission of the mock trial may have been for staging, we have no knowledge of how Shakespeare perceived that omission; its absence from F tells us nothing about Shakespeare's intention or preference. 15 The First Folio was printed fifteen years after First Quarto Lear and seven years after Shakespeare died. The copy or copies behind Folio Lear were probably much better than what lay behind Q. Scholarly consensus holds that the F text was set from a marked-up copy of Q2 (see note 1) and a promptbook copy of Q1 ( TC 509, 529). But as Greg pointed out, the prompt-book, whether autograph or not, might also have undergone some modification to suit it to the needs of the theater, the exigencies of the cast, or the prejudices of the censor. The words or even the intention of the author might have been to some extent altered. In a properly constructed promptbook the text no doubt received . . . final revision but we can never be sure at whose hand it received it. ( The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare 156) Roger Warren and others who contend that Shakespeare cut the mock trial while revising Q in order to improve the scene on stage go no further than pronouncing that belief. They provide no evidence that proves Shakespeare cut the mock trial from his play. Yet, comparison of readings in both texts, with particular emphasis on what remains in the cut text, F, indicates that the omission was not authorial. It is my view, then, that those who wish to see Shakespeare's work will read and perform King Lear with the mock trial intact.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV There are two major differences between the textual circumstances surrounding the mock trial scene and those connected with the substantive alterations in the final scene of the play. First, it is F, not Q, that offers the superior reading of the ending. Second, theatrical intervention is generally not held responsible for the differences between the two texts in the last scene. Although there are many differences between Q and F throughout the final scene, my analysis will focus on the concluding moments of the play (Q: L4r; F: ss3r). In both texts, Lear enters carrying the dead Cordelia. He charges the "men of stones" to look upon the horror, for if he had their eyes and tongues he would use them "so that heaven's vault should crack" ( Riverside V.iii.258-260). During this last scene, he turns in torment between hope that perhaps she still lives and conviction that she is "dead as earth" and will come no more—dead for no reason while dogs, horses and rats live ( Riverside V.iii.262, 307). Here, as in the mock trial scene, what an audience may perceive as clinical madness is Lear's display of an intense, undying charge for justice and a profound revelation of what it means to be human. It is at the moment of greatest anguish that the two texts, Q and F, diverge. Q reads as follows (including in the absence of spacing between some words): Lear . And my poore foole is hangd, no, no life, why should a dog,a horse, a rat of life and thou no breath at all, O thou wilt come no more, neuer,neuer,neuer, pray you vndo this button, thanke you sir, O, o,o,o. Edg . He faints my Lord,my Lord. Lear . Breake hart, I prethe breake. Edgar . Look vp my Lord. Kent . Vex not his ghost, O let him passe, He hates him that would vpon the wracke, Of this tough world stretch him out longer. Edg . O he is gone indeed. (Q: L4r; Riverside V.iii.306-316) And Folio, Lear . And my poore Foole is hang'd: no,no,no, life? Why should a Dog,a Horse,a Rat haue life, And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more, Neuer,neuer,neuer,neuer,neuer. Pray you vndo this Button. Thanke you Sir, Do you see this? Looke on her? Looke her lips, Looke there,looke there. He dies. Edg . He faints,my Lord,my Lord. Kent . Breake heart,I prythee breake. Edg . Looke vp my Lord. Kent . Vex not his ghost . . . Stretch him out longer. Edg. He is gon indeed. (F: ss3r) According to the Oxford editors, the Q reading reflects Shakespeare's original thoughts and the F reading his improved revision. Rethinking his initial work, the author added one "no," and two "nevers"; reassigned Lear's line in Q, "Breake hart, I prethe breake" to Kent; substituted "Do you see this? Looke on her? Looke her lips, / Looke there, looke there" for Lear's "O, o, o, o"; and then to end the play gave Edgar the final speech rather than Albany. Textual and bibliographical evidence suggests, however, that what was Shakespeare's reading in Q's copy was something other and longer than what is in Q—perhaps what is extant in F. Furthermore, that same evidence indicates that compositorial error and printing house negligence, rather than the author's second thoughts, are responsible for Q's alternate reading. By studying the First Quarto in conjunction with those works printed by Nicholas Okes before, during, and after Lear , Peter Blayney calculated that the printing of Lear began on 10 December 1607, was interrupted by the Christmas holidays, and was completed sometime in early January (85). It was the first play-quarto Okes had ever printed and, according to Blayney, it is the only play-quarto "which can fairly claim a place among Okes's half-dozen worst-printed books of 1607-1609" (184-185). Blayney compares Okes' work with other seventeenth-century printers and concludes that "there were printers whose worst was worse than Okes's—but not very many, and not much worse" (29; emphasis Blayney's). Moreover, the seriatim method that Okes chose to set Q "caused unprecedented problems of type-supply" (184). 16 The Oxford editors have acknowledged that Okes' inexperience, his shortage of type, the incompetence of his compositors, and an illegible or confusing manuscript may account for peculiarities in punctuation and lineation. 17 They do not go so far as to argue, however, that the variations in the final scene are the result of Okes' printing-house deficiencies—that the reading in F may have existed in the printer's copy for Q but was unintentionally left out due to carelessness or deliberately omitted to save space and conserve type. When setting seriatim, or in reading order, usually the inner forme of a sheet will be printed before the outer forme, since the second, third, sixth, and seventh type-pages of the gathering will have been imposed before the outer forme (which contains the eighth type-page) has been completely set. Peter Blayney shows, however, that in the case of Q the outer forme of sheet L, the final sheet, was printed before the inner forme (217-218). Furthermore, the outer forme of sheet L contains only three pages of text; L4v (the eighth type-page) is left blank. Hence, the play ends on inner L4r, the seventh type-page of the gathering. Blayney also tells us that the ends of L3r, L3v, L4r might have been set by a compositor other than C. In his discussion of sheet L. Blayney adds: There is one textual peculiarity which might possibly be taken to suggest that the end of L3r [the fifth type-page] and the last two pages were set by a compositor other than C . . . while C took over B's case to set from mid-L1v [the second type-page] to mid-L3r, another compositor set the end of the text from the other case. That compositor might have been either B or a third workman. . . . Whether or not the evidence could suggest a third compositor, therefore, there is no good reason to suspect a departure from seriatim setting in sheet L. (141) With this information we can reconstruct the order of events during the imposition and printing of Q's sheet L. First, compositor B set L1r of the outer forme. Next, C set L1v and L2r of the inner forme. C then set L2v and L3r of the outer forme. Having completed the imposition of outer L1r, L2v, L3r (the first, fourth, and fifth type-pages) and seeing no need for L4v—the whole text nearly completed—compositor C decided to go ahead and print outer L assuming that the remaining text could be fitted onto the last two pages of the inner form, L3v and L4r. Whatever the reason, the outer forme was in fact printed prior to the inner forme, leaving L4v blank. 18 The outer forme of sheet L having been printed, a different compositor, perhaps B, finished setting inner L3v and L4r (the sixth and seventh type-pages). The imposition of L1v, L2r, L3v, and L4r having been completed, the inner forme was then printed. The procedure described above proves to be of pivotal importance when deciding who or what is responsible for the variations between Q and F in the final scene. What is most notable about this procedure is the drastic space problems it created when setting the end of the play. The obvious crowding of text in the final two pages of Q shows clearly that when setting inner L3v and L4r, the compositor found himself running out of room. If we examine Lear's final speech as it appears in Q (L4r), for example, we see that verse has been crowded into prose and that the compositors left little or no space between certain words such as "neuer,neuer" and "hart,I." We see also that Edgar's two split lines have been merged with the previous lines. Since outer L had already gone through the press, the compositor, with more text to set than space allowed, had no choice but to make the necessary adjustments to complete the play on inner L4r. It is not surprising, then, that the most substantive variants, such as those in Lear's final speech, occur on L4r, the last page of text. It is altogether conceivable that the compositor omitted one "no," two "nevers," and inserted a simple "O, o, o, o" for Lear's last words, "Do you see this? Looke on her? Looke her lips, / Looke there, looke there." Furthermore, Q's assignment of "Break hart, I prethe breake" to Lear, rather than Kent, must be a compositorial error. Surely Lear has uttered his final words and is probably dead, just as the F text indicates. In the Oxford edition of Q the editors have cleaned up the mess that is illustrated plainly in the extant text. Their version reads: LEAR And my poore foole is hangd, no, no life, Why should a dog, a horse, a rat haue life And thou no breath at all, O thou wilt come no more, Neuer, neuer, neuer, pray you vndo This button, thanke you sir, O, o, o, o. EDGAR He faints (to Lear) my Lord, my Lord. LEAR Breake hart, I prethe breake. EDGAR Look vp my Lord. KENT Vex not his ghost, O let him passe, he hates him That would vpon the wracke of this tough world Stretch him out longer. [Lear dies] EDGAR O he is gone indeed . . . (24.3083-3094) The Oxford editors' reconstruction of this scene in their edition of Q and their claim that it is authorial is incompatible with the physical evidence present in the extant text. They have inserted a "[Lear dies]" where they believe Shakespeare had originally intended the King to die, but it is just as likely—even more likely—that the compositor simply left out the proper stage direction to save space and accidentally assigned Kent's line to Lear; it is illogical for Lear to speak this line after Edgar announces he has fainted. One may argue further that the line in question rightfully belongs to Kent, a character who throughout the play has dedicated himself to the protection and service of the King. In the end that sympathy is expressed in his wish for his master's death: "Breake heart, I prythee breake." Kent's message is clear: death brings peace at last. Edgar resists letting Lear go, just as he kept his father from dying at the cliffs of Dover: "Look vp my Lord," he says to Lear. Remaining loyal to his master, however, Kent insists that Edgar "Vex not his ghost, O let him passe." 19 A textual and bibliographical examination of the central and final acts provides no evidence that Shakespeare is responsible for the alterations I have discussed in this essay—that he revised "come on bee true" to "come vnbutton heere," omitted thirty-one lines of the mock trial, or altered the play's ending. Indeed, a problem in the Lear texts is that we often have difficulty identifying who or what is responsible for many of the variant readings. Recent scholarship has frequently resolved this difficulty by emphasizing authorial revision: we have no clear evidence that alterations are not authorial. But authorial revision is only one possible source of alteration. In this essay, I have argued that even if Shakespeare revised other portions of Lear (and other plays), physical evidence does exist which suggests that he was not responsible for the variations between the early texts in these key scenes of King Lear . The extant texts of King Lear record a history of many influences, including authorial creation and the publication process. But if an editor's aim is to distinguish authorial material from non-authorial material—such as alterations made by a compositor, proof-reader, or through theatrical intervention—and attempt to construct a critical text that comes closest to Shakespeare's, it is necessary to draw on both early texts for physical evidence and to consolidate certain readings. A judicious consolidation of the passages I have discussed in this essay does not falsify Shakespeare's art. Instead, such treatment offers more accurate presentations than does either extant text or the Oxford editions of those texts. In naming their book The Division of the Kingdoms; Shakespeare's Two Versions of King Lear , Gary Taylor and Michael Warren selected the unrevised Quarto reading of Gloucester's words for their title: ". . . the diuision of the kingdomes [plural] . . ." (Q: B1r)—a reading that makes no sense as far as Lear's purpose is concerned. Let us pay closer heed, then, to the rendition of that same passage in Folio Lear : ". . . the diuision of the Kingdome, / it appeares not . . ." (F: qq2). Selected Bibliography Berger, Thomas L.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I wish to thank David Bevington, Douglas Bruster, Robert J. Fehrenbach, Michael Murrin, Bruce Redford, and Francis-Noël Thomas for reading and commenting upon this essay in its various stages. I am especially grateful to Professor Fehrenbach who introduced me to textual and bibliographical studies and to the texts of King Lear . 1 The First Quarto was entered in the Stationer's Register on 26 November 1607 and was published in 1608 for Nathaniel Butter. It is a poorly printed text with sporadic punctuation, incorrect lineation, limited stage directions and several unintelligible readings. Still, Q is not considered a "bad quarto" as are the earliest editions of Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet , and Henry V. A second quarto (Q2) was published in 1619 by William Jaggard for Thomas Pavier. Studies have shown that the copy for Q2 was an exemplar of Q1. But with the exception of the occurrence of a new speech in Q2 sheet I, Q2 is a reprint of Q1 (see, for example, Michael J. Warren's discussion of Q2 in The Parallel King Lear p. XII, published separately as Part 1 of The Complete King Lear 1608-1623 ). Folio Lear contains numerous corrected spellings, clearer punctuation, and improved lineation. F also provides ample stage directions and divides the play into acts and scenes. Although F frequently reproduces obvious errors from Q, editors have typically based their editions on F, turning to Q for assistance in correcting erroneous readings in F and including passages, thought to be authorial, that appear only in Q. There are approximately 300 lines or half-lines that occur only in Q and approximately 180 lines that appear exclusively in F. In addition, there are roughly 850 variations between the texts in wording, punctuation, lineation and spelling. Several speeches are differently assigned between Q and F, the most famous of which affects the final speech: Albany closes the play in Q, while Edgar speaks the last lines in F. 2 See especially, William Shakespeare; The Complete Works , Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, eds. (1986); Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (1987); The Division of the Kingdoms; Shakespeare's Two Versions of King Lear , Gary Taylor and Michael J. Warren, eds. (1983). These frequently quoted works will hereafter be cited in this essay using the abbreviations CW , TC , and Division respectively. See also Michael J. Warren, The Complete King Lear 1608-1623 (1989); Michael J. Warren, "Quarto and Folio King Lear and the Interpretation of Albany and Edgar," Shakespeare: Pattern of Excelling Nature , David Bevington and Jay L. Halio, eds. (1978) 95-107; Steven Urkowitz, Shakespeare's Revision of King Lear (1980); Grace Iappolo, Revising Shakespeare (1991). 3 Other plays that are thought to have undergone considerable authorial revision include 2 Henry IV, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, Othello and Richard II ( CW 17). 4 G. Thomas Tanselle argues that "the attempt to reconstruct authorially intended texts is one of the many activities that readers can engage in as they evaluate the socially produced evidence that survives for their examination" ("Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" 99). Nor does "a concern with authorial intention . . . contradict the idea of textual instability, for authors' intentions shift with time, and our reconstructions of their intended texts can never be definitive" (95). Finally, the attempt to recover authorial intention does not depend upon how recoverable the author's intention is; rather, it is a question of deciding whether the attempt to recover the past is of "interest or relevance." Tanselle writes, "We never know whether anything is recoverable, nor do we know when we have in fact recovered something; all we can do is attempt to move in the direction of recovering whatever we have decided is worth recovering. Deciding that the past can be of interest or relevance is the crucial matter, not how recoverable it is" (94).

Shillingsburg, "Text as Matter, Concept, and Action," SB 44 (1991): 31-82. 5 I have adopted the phrase "consolidated presentation" or "consolidated treatment" from G. Thomas Tanselle, whose essay "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" has influenced the reasoning behind my argument. See especially pages 134-137 of that essay. I use "consolidated presentation" rather than "conflation" since the latter has come to imply an imprudent mixing of distinct authorial versions. To say that editors have "conflated distinct versions" is to suggest that they have "distorted" and "falsified the historical situation" (136). As Tanselle points out further, however, "One is not mixing versions simply by drawing readings from different documents, since the texts of documents cannot be equated with the texts of versions—a fact recognized in the original decision to present a critical text. After all, traditional critical editors interested in authors' final intentions are not trying to mix versions but to recreate one-one that is not present in satisfactory form in any surviving document" (120). 6 Many scholars have proposed arguments to account for variant readings in the early texts of King Lear .

Huntington Library , Michael J. B. Allen and Kenneth Muir, eds. (1981) 664-703. Citations from F are taken from The Tragedie of King Lear, The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare , Charleton Hinman, ed. (1968) 801-817. For the reader's convenience I also cite act, scene, and line designations from The Tragedy of King Lear, The Riverside Shakespeare , G. Blakemore Evans, ed. (1974) 1249-1305. 9 In asking "But why 'tempestious', to which 'contentious' can have borne little resemblance?", Peter Blayney answers his own question with a depiction of proof-reader tactics and the mechanical difficulties associated with correcting type while consulting copy. According to Blayney, memory lapse and faulty hand-eye coordination explain the proof-reader's erroneous emendation (249). One might also have noted that given the context of Lear's speech, "tempestious" offers a sensible correction made by a proof-reader who did not trouble himself to consult the manuscript or who, when he did, could not decipher it. Six lines after "this contentious storme," Lear speaks of the "tempest" in his mind (Q: G1r; Riverside III.iv.12), and ten lines after that, in a passage addressed to his fool, the King continues to develop the storm metaphor: "Prethe goe in thy selfe, seeke thy one ease / This tempest will not giue me leaue to ponder / On things would hurt me more, but ile goe in" (Q: G1v; Riverside III.iv.23-25). In his discussion of press variants, Peter Blayney maintains that the proof-reader consulted his manuscript at all times when correcting outer G. He even argues that F's "contentious" was a later restoration of the original word that stood in Q's copy but claims that the proof-reader for Q did check his copy, and because of the illegible quality of the manuscript at G1r30 he had no choice but to guess at the proper word. Blayney says that the copy was checked carefully throughout outer G, since shortly after his false emendation of "crulentious" the proof-reader successfully corrected "raging sea" to "roring sea" and "the" to "this." Subsequently in his argument, however, Blayney argues that even if we find evidence that a manuscript was consulted during correction, we have no guarantee it was checked line by line or page by page: "The existence of a fussy or trivial correction in any one line of a forme which was elsewhere corrected by reference to the manuscript may or may not show that the correction itself was made after consultation, but it fails to guarantee that no major substantive errors remain in the same line." According to Blayney, we must not assume that, "when consulted at all, the manuscript was consulted with uniform care. Readings which had been deliberately altered by the compositor (or by the proof-reader himself when correcting foul proofs) were allowed to stand, and readings which would have been recognized as errors had they been noticed were overlooked. When consultation of the manuscript showed that a supposed error was in fact the original reading, it was likely to be altered anyway (291)." Blayney's observation here leads one to question his earlier assertion that reference was made to copy during the false emendation of "crulentious" to "tempestious." But this inconsistency in Blayney's discussion is a minor issue in relation to the sound logic of his two main points. First, there are several probable sources of revision and alteration in Q: the proof-reader may not have consulted the manuscript when correcting type and, therefore, introduced his own revision; compositors sometimes failed to carry out or follow properly the proof-reader's instructions, correcting the wrong word, inserting the wrong type, or simply misreading a word. Second, the Folio reading is a restoration of the original reading, and, therefore, what we find in F belongs in Q. 10 The textual notes for III.vi. of King Lear in The Riverside Shakespeare show another example of compositor B's inability to distinguish correctly between "r," "o," and "u" and between the minims "m" and "n." Q reads "Come o'er the broom" (25), but editors agree that the correct reading for "broom" is "bourn," meaning either "burn" or "brook." 11 Setting by formes allowed for greater flexibility of work schedules and a more advantageous supply of type, since the order of typesetting and printing did not depend on the final order of the text. Printing could begin as soon as either forme had been set. In this way more than one compositor, or in some cases more than one printing house, could work on different parts of the same text simultaneously. If, when setting by formes, the printer had overestimated his copy, he would compensate for error by introducing "white space" in the text. If on the other hand he had underestimated his copy, he would make adjustments by crowding verse into prose, neglecting proper punctuation, or by leaving little or no space between words and sentences. The quickest and easiest solution, of course, was simply to cut portions of his copy when he had underestimated the number of sheets necessary to print the text accurately and was therefore running out of room. Deletions under these circumstances were not uncommon. 12 Substantive cuts do not of course always derive from careless proofreading, compositorial error, or improper casting-off. Changes throughout F may have been made through reference to an independent manuscript, which may or may not have contained the author's revisions—although Thomas L. Berger, in his review of The Oxford Shakespeare, points out that for the Oxford editors "may" becomes "does" (145). Or F may have been set up from a copy of an earlier edition that had been altered by others. If the copy had been used as a promptbook, for example, some of these alterations might have been introduced by an actor or spectator from his recollection of performance. And no bibliographical investigation can dismiss the possibility of scribal interference with the manuscript used to annotate the printer's copy for F. In his essay, "Folio Editors, Folio Compositors, and the Folio Text of King Lear ," Paul Werstine measures the influence of editors and compositors on F by examining changes in stage directions and "incidental" verbal forms that affect meaning, tone, and meter such as contractions, elisions, and substitutions ( Division 247-312). Werstine concludes that editors and compositors may be held accountable for only a fraction of the 300 lines or half lines from Q that were cut in F (284). Hinman drew opposite conclusions in his two-volume study of the Folio, summarized in his Introduction to The Norton Facsimile . He did not think the proof-readers and compositors were skilled enough or conscientious enough to produce a text relatively free of accidental or deliberate cuts (xvi). According to Hinman, Jaggard worked with an indifferent attitude toward accuracy—not unlike Okes. His primary concern was to eliminate obvious typographical mistakes, and he often did so without consulting copy, introducing new errors rather than preserving authorial readings or rendering more reliable readings than those originally set. Hinman's evaluation of the Folio compositors was even less optimistic than his view of Jaggard. According to him, two compositors, E and B, set Folio Lear . E set more than half the play; judging from his many obvious errors, Hinman concluded that E was essentially incapable of setting even printed copy accurately. Compositor B's errors are much less conspicuous; he would neglect the authority of his copy and then conceal his inaccuracies by modifying the text (xix). 13 For similar reasons other substantive cuts in III.vi of F, namely the omission of Kent's Oppressed nature sleeps" speech and Edgar's soliloquy, "When we our betters see bearing our woes . . . ," have been considered deliberate cuts, although not necessarily authorial cuts ( Riverside III.vi.97-115). 14 When I cite only from Riverside in this discussion and those that follow, the corresponding quotations are found in both Q and F. 15 G. Thomas Tanselle raises this issue in "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology": "the collaborative character of theatrical production raises in extreme form the question of how authorial intention in a work of language is to be conceived" (122). Following from this observation, he assesses T. H. Howard-Hill's arguments in "Modern Textual Theories and the Editing of Plays" ( Library , 6th ser., 11 [1989], 89-115). Tanselle writes, ". . . the versions that reached the public in performance are obviously of historical interest. What is objectionable in Howard-Hill's presentation is his insistence that the only legitimate critical texts for representing playwrights' final intentions are those based on performance texts (or such textual evidence as there is of what actually occurred in performance). His account is notably unbalanced in not sufficiently recognizing that alterations made for performance (even if agreed to by the playwright) do not always please the playwright" (124). 16 Blayney observes that Okes' customary method was not seriatim, but setting by formes, and that Okes did not own a very large stock of type: "In seriatim work it is necessary to set at least seven pages before the first imposition of each sheet, and if the pages are to have headlines before the second forme of the previous sheet comes off the press, at least eleven are needed. . . . Okes's norm is likely to have been setting by formes. . . . It seems evident that the fount was not really adequate to the task [of setting seriatim]. . . . The shortage of type is another factor which affected the work—and consequently the text—from time to time" (150). 17 The editors write, ". . . type-shortage probably accounts, in part, for some of the text's deficiencies, particularly the peculiarity of the punctuation and lineation . . . Even after every allowance has been made for the possibility that Quarto variants may be authorial alternatives rather than errors, Q remains exceptionally unreliable in its distinction between prose and verse, and in its arrangement of verse" ( TC 510). 18 Blayney suggests that Okes may have deliberately wanted L4v to be left blank. He states, "Okes seems generally to have attempted to end the text either on the final recto of a gathering or on the verso before the final leaf—thus allowing a blank to protect the print when folded or stitched copies were stored without wrappers. For the same reason he preferred to leave a blank leaf before the titlepage where possible" (96). 19 When we consider that there are nine instances of alternate speech assignments in sheet L, many of which have been judged by scholars as compositorial blunders, it is less surprising to find Albany, rather than Edgar, delivering the final speech in Q. The following citations indicate different speech assignments or speech prefix alterations in L. Numbers specify lines in the Riverside edition: 70, Q Gonorill, F Albany; 81, Q Bastard, F Regan; 161, Q Gonorill, F Bastard; 237, Q Duke, F Albany; 252, Q Duke, F Edgar; 276, Q Captain, F Gentleman; 296, Q Captain, F Messenger; 319, Q Duke, F Albany; 324, Q Duke, F Edgar.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Concluding Pages of the Jonson Folio of 1616 by James A. Riddell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some years ago, in their justly admired edition of Ben Jonson, Herford and Simpson 1 established what they thought were the original and the corrected versions of the last two pages of the Jonson Folio of 1616, based on what they considered to be sound bibliographical evidence. The pages in question are those on which are printed the concluding passages of Jonson's masque The Golden Age Restored . Initially, Herford and Simpson suggested that "it is possible that the original ending [of the masque] was used at the court performance and that the revision was an afterthought designed to give a more significant ending to the Folio" (VII, 420). They amplified this observation later in their "Survey of the Text," but in a strangely self-contradictory way. "The Masques , of which Stansby registered a number in 1615," they contend, show no sign of the author's correction except on the last two pages, where he transposed effectively the final speeches, making Astraea decide that she would return to earth in order to bask in the sunshine of King James's court. The text of the entertainments and the masques is often carelessly printed, and the Latin and Greek quotations in the notes are especially bad. Jonson cannot have read the proofs . It is probable that the printer, registering this section of the work in 1615 and producing it in 1616, hurried the printing [emphasis added]. (IX, 72) If the "transposing" of the speeches was a stop-press "correction," as it surely must have been since both versions are extant and the type was not reset, 2 how could it have been made by Jonson—who, we are told, "cannot have read the proofs"? I can think of no answer. What, then, could have led such careful scholars into such a muddle? The answer seems to be that they were convinced that the large-paper sheets of all of the gatherings of the Folio were printed after the small-paper sheets, 3 and since the large-paper copies have the "corrected" version of the masque, Jonson must have been responsible—even though they must contradict themselves to make the contention. But it is a mistake to assume that the large-paper sheets were always printed first. Kevin Donovan has demonstrated conclusively that in the case of the masques large-paper sheets were sometimes the first printed, for instance in gatherings 4M-4P. 4 The same holds true, in fact, for many gatherings in the Folio, which Doctor Gerritsen has been aware of for over thirty years, and which I hope to demonstrate in the not-too-distant future. 5 In the case of The Golden Age Restored , Donovan has also shown that "the version ending with the speech of Pallas and the praise of Jove [is most probably] the revision" and that the other way round "is much less likely." I shall show that the other way is in fact impossible. But first I should like to call attention to some of the directions that commentary and criticism have taken in recent years as a result of the Oxford editors' assumptions about the "original" and "corrected" versions of the two pages. It would, in fact, be fair to say that influential interpretations of the ending, and therefore of the masque itself, have been misdirected because the "original" and "corrected" versions have been wrongly construed. In a note to his edition of the masques Stephen Orgel somewhat extends the speculation of Herford and Simpson by suggesting that The Golden Age Restored was "Performed twice, January 6 and 8, 1615. This precedes Mercury Vindicated . Possibly Jonson printed it out of chronological order because the descent of Astraea and closing paean to King James made The Golden Age a more effective conclusion to the 1616 folio, in which it appears as the final work." 6 Giving due credit to the Oxford editors, he amplifies this a bit by saying that the final speech of Pallas originally followed that of Astraea, and the two "are so printed in some copies of the first folio. Originally, that is, the masque concluded by moving with Pallas from earth to heaven; but Jonson changed his mind while the volume was in the press, and in the revised version Astraea decides to remain on an earth transformed by the excellence of King James." Jonathan Goldberg, interested in demonstrating Jonson's participation in "an age where all is bought and sold," goes beyond Orgel in explaining why Jonson chose to end the collection of masques and thereby the Folio with The Golden Age Restored rather than with Mercury Vindicated . For Goldberg, the changed ending reveals yet more striking insights into Jonson's motives—and want of success—than Orgel had ventured. Jonson wanted the king to give him money ("crassly put, the masque concerns James's largesse, for the simplest terms that translate the restoral of the golden age are monetary ones"); but even though Jonson rearranged the ending of The Golden Age Restored in an effort to press his case, he had but little luck: "[James] went on giving and grudging, and although Jonson revised the printed version of The Golden Age Restored to leave the kingdom of Jove quite firmly 'present here' (line 215), the poet's power in that instance remained something he could only exhibit in his text and not with the monarch he tried to imprint." 7 Joseph Loewenstein takes the process one step further. He omits the "original" printed version. He talks as if there were only the "original" version, the one which was a part of the masque when it was performed at court, and another version, "printed with a text that manifestly scrambles the conclusion as it was performed in 1615." 8 Curiously, Loewenstein may be right about the order of the speeches in the court performance, but for the opposite of the reason he adduces. That is, if the Astraea/Pallas ending is the corrected one, as I am convinced it is, it may very well be that of the court performance. What accounts for the Pallas/Astraea version being machined first I do not know. It has the masque ending with " Galliards and Coranto's ," which might have made sense to a compositor; a couple of pages of Jonson's manuscript may have been mixed up; possibilities for conjecture are numerous. 9 Whatever caused the original setting to be as it was, someone soon intervened to get it right. Although it has been thought that Jonson had relatively little to do with the printing of the masques—unlike the bulk of the volume, in which he took extraordinary interest—he may have been the one who intervened. 10 In any case, Loewenstein builds an argument that depends upon the Pallas/Astraea ending being the "corrected" one, one which reflects Jonson's attempt to make a statement on the printed page that, in effect, subverts the statement he "originally" devised: The performance had been contrived to praise James and then to check and chasten that praise. . . . In performance Astraea points to that bright region beyond the proscenium where sits the king and she does not have the last word; on the page, the deictic insistence—"This, this, and onely such as this"—claims a textual authority without semantic closure. . . . In performance, Pallas ends by pointing heavenward; on the page, Astraea ends by pointing, but in a direction that it lies within the power of the printed page to withhold. (p. 187) Perhaps it is useful to speculate about iconographic meanings that attend Jonson's manipulations of the printed versions of his works. It is unfortunate to base such speculation on a bibliographical assumption that turns out to have been wrong. In the following pages I shall argue that the Astraea/Pallas ending makes much more sense, and, for reasons both bibliographical and literary, must be what Jonson intended. It is the former, of course, that I take to be the clinching argument.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographical Evidence When stop-press corrections are made, they come early in the run, or there is, of course, little point in making them. That is, if the aim of the printer is to have as many corrected sheets as possible, he will begin proofing and correcting as soon as he can. And if one is talking about authorial corrections, or at least an attempt to follow authorial intention, one or the other of which seems most likely in the present instance, corrections would be made early or not at all. Therefore, the mere proportions of copies with the Astraea/Pallas conclusion or the Pallas/Astraea conclusion provide evidence as to which is the corrected version. In the argument I wish to pursue here, this evidence corroborates conclusions that are drawn from a close examination of physical differences in the printing of the two versions. The sequence is this: all of the large-paper sheets of 4Q2-3 v and 1 v -4 were machined with the Pallas/Astraea conclusion 11 and then some of the small-paper sheets (in the neighborhood of ten percent) were. 12 Then someone intervened to reverse the order of the Pallas/Astraea speeches. The sequence is decisively established by a piece of type that was broken during the machining of 1 v -4 after the speeches had been rearranged to Astraea/Pallas. 13 In all large-paper copies and in the small-paper copies with the original arrangement (i.e., Pallas/Astraea), after the word "unsold" in line thirty of 4Q4 (the penultimate line of Astraea's speech) the comma is intact (see Fig. 1). After the type was rearranged, and the line became line eight of 4Q4, for a while the comma remained intact (as in four of sixteen copies with the final leaf present that I have recently examined). Subsequently, however, during the press run of the rearranged forme (Astraea/Pallas), the comma, its face somewhat broken, went adrift. As the broken comma moved, it was pushed into the letter "d," more and more, by stages. A glance at Figs. 2 and 3 (reproduced at twice actual size) reveal that such movement did take place, even to the point of the broken comma subsequently damaging "d." The letter "d" and the disintegrating comma seem to have survived the press run; at least I am not aware of any evidence that they did not. Although one might argue that the Pallas/Astraea ending was machined first, that during the press run, or even after, the comma was broken and subsequently replaced when the speeches were rearranged, the argument will not hold. Even punctuation marks can be distinctive. Depending upon how the comma was inked (there is of course some variation), little or almost no curve can be seen in the concave side; the convex side is flattened at an angle of about forty-five degrees at the bottom. I have taken a sample of commas in the text nearby. Of one hundred successive commas, this one being the last of the lot, none compares with it. Although there could, of course, be more than one comma thus distinctive, the chances are slim, and the chances are exceedingly remote that a compositor replaced the present one with a "duplicate" (if such a thing even existed) when the Pallas/Astraea ending was altered to be Astraea/Pallas, or at any other time. If one compares the (intact but somewhat distorted) comma following "unsold" with the commas in the half-dozen lines immediately preceding, one sees that the "unsold" comma remained the same until it was broken. There are, conveniently, several other details which, though less conclusive, are nevertheless useful in helping to confirm the order of printing that I have just described. Sometime after the Pallas/Astraea speeches were rearranged, another variation was introduced. In line three of 4Q2 a space between the words "fraud" and "and" was pulled to the level of the type face (no doubt by the inking ball) and subsequently inked and printed. 14 The raised space is in itself less conclusive than the broken comma because the space could have been pulled to the "surface" and then subsequently forced back down. However, with the evidence of the broken comma providing the essential underpinning for my argument, the raised inking space serves quite well in support. Another detail is that the Pallas/Astraea version has "The End" in caps and small caps, in rather small type. The Astraea/Pallas version has "The end" in much larger type and in upper and lower case. The font used for the reset "The end" is the same as that used for the words "The Catalogue," on the first page of set type of the preliminary matter, ¶3. 15 It is reasonable to suppose that the compositor, following the customary practice of setting the preliminaries last, was drawing upon that font when the speeches were reversed and that he employed it as a matter of convenience. As it happens, the font is one that was employed but sparingly in the Folio. Aside from "The Catalogue" on ¶3 and "The end" on 4Q4, it appears at most at sixteen places, 16 each time as part of the title of a play or entertainment or masque, but in no instance running for more than two or three words. There is also another connection between the final pages of the volume and the preliminaries. The watermarks in the preliminaries are all grape bunches. I have charted all watermarks in twenty-two small-paper copies and have found only one instance of these grapes in the body of the volume (in 4I2.5 of one copy). This single example, present perhaps by accident, does at least show that the grape-bunch stock of the preliminaries was in Stansby's shop when some of the last quires were being printed. To return to the issue raised at the first part of this section, how many copies, then, were printed with the original Pallas/Astraea ending and how many with the reverse? I have consulted sixty-nine copies of the Folio, and add to that number six of those cited by Greg which I have not yet examined, for a total of seventy-five. Four of those (all small-paper copies) are missing both of the last leaves, and thus provide no evidence. Of the seventy-one remaining, six are large-paper copies, all of which retain the Pallas/Astraea ending. One small-paper copy, the Lowell volume in the Houghton Library, 17 has bound in with the normal small-paper sheets several of large-paper cut down to small-paper size, including all of 4Q. This can be readily determined by examining the watermarks. There are some three dozen different watermarks in the various sheets used for the small-paper printing, but large-paper copies have only variants of one watermark, a shield with three lions. 18 Of the sixty-four copies with the final quire printed on small-paper sheets, six have the Pallas/Astraea ending and fifty-eight the reverse. As the vast majority of the small-paper copies, and therefore a substantial preponderance of all copies, 19 have the Astraea/Pallas ending, the mere probability of there being more corrected copies than uncorrected suggests that Astraea/Pallas is the corrected state. 20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Literary Implications If the bibliographical details determine that the Astraea/Pallas ending is the corrected one, how does this affect our reading? Is the Astraea/Pallas ending, at the very least, consistent with the arrangement of other parts of the Golden Age Restored ? In the first place, there is a great deal of symmetry in the masque, both in its beginning and ending—its "framework"—and within its parts. The masque begins with (stage direction): "pallas in her chariot descending ," to explain the implication of events. Jove intends to restore justice to mankind by returning Astraea to the face of the earth. To ready earth (or at least "this happie Ile") for its new Golden Age, in which "burried arts shall flourish," Pallas calls forth the poets " Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate, Spencer ." At the conclusion of the masque, Jove's intention realized, Astraea once more on earth, Pallas ascends. The conclusion can be seen in three parts: (1) We hear Astraea, who is content with her return to earth, observing: "What a change is here! I had not more / Desire to leave the earth before, / Then I have now, to stay;" (2) "pallas ascending calls them " to tell them that they are now to live with the restored Astraea ("them" refers to the celebrants, the members of the audience, who, in effect, represent mankind); (3) finally, for the restoration of the Golden Age, we hear the Quire declaring that "To Jove , to Jove , be all the honour given, / That thankefull hearts can raise from earth to heaven." Of the symmetries within the masque, the one that bears most on the present argument lies in the various presentations of the Quire. Throughout the masque, the function of the Quire is to moralize ("Let narrow Natures [how they will] mistake, / The great should still be good for their owne sake" [101-102]), to institute action ("Awake, awake, for whom these times were kept" [133]), and to summarize, with the moralizing and summarizing often coming at the same time. The last portion of the masque—about the last two-fifths of the text, though it must have constituted well over half of the playing time—contains the three dances of the masque and the commentary following them, all celebrating the return of Astraea to earth. The dances and their music are introduced by the Quire: But, as of old, all now be gold, Move, move then to these sounds. And, doe, not onely, walke your solemne rounds, But give those light and ayrie bounds, That fit the Genii of these gladder grounds. The pattern of the parts which follow is quite consistent. After " The first dance " there are lines spoken or sung by Pallas, Astraea, Age, Pallas, and the Quire. There follows " The maine daunce ," then lines spoken or sung by Pallas, Poets, and the Quire, and finally " Dance with ladies ," then lines spoken or sung by Astraea, Pallas, and the Quire. The Quire's concluding prayer of thanks is the couplet mentioned above: To Jove , to Jove , be all the honour given, That thankefull hearts can raise from earth to heaven. Which calls attention to one more pattern that suggests one more argument that the Astraea/Pallas ending is the one Jonson intended: all but three of Jonson's masques before The Golden Age Restored end with songs, and all of them that could end with a song do so. 21 Thus, the literary argument that I am suggesting is at the least compatible with the bibliographical one, and, given the strength of the former, may be considered to be compelling.</field>

I am grateful to Adrian Weiss for helpful suggestions he has made. 2 Herford and Simpson correctly note that "the printer unlocked the forme and transposed the stanzas without disturbing the type" (VII, 420). 3 See: V, 148-49; IX, 40. 4 "The Final Quires of the Jonson 1616 Workes : Headline Evidence," Studies in Bibliography , 40 (1987), 119. 5 Johan Gerritsen, "Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio," English Studies , 40 (1959), 54. It is to be regretted that in the last thirty years Dr. Gerritsen has not been able to set out the very promising (and tantalizing) fruits of his investigations into the Jonson 1616 Folio; I earnestly pray that my "not-too-distant future" will be measured in terms of years, not decades. 6 Stephen Orgel, ed., Ben Jonson: The Complete Masques (1969), p. 484. 7 Jonathan Goldberg, James I and the Politics of Literature: Jonson, Shakespeare, Donne and Their Contemporaries (1983), pp. 136, 268, n. 22. 8 Joseph Loewenstein, "Printing and 'The Multitudinous Presse,'" in Ben Jonson's 1616 Folio , ed. Jennifer Brady and W. H. Herendeen (1991), p. 186. This also is the argument that Loewenstein makes in his Responsive Readings: Versions of Echo in Pastoral, Epic, and the Jonsonian Masque (1984), pp. 122-123, although in that volume he does acknowledge two printed versions. 9 I have no confidence that I shall ever be able to resolve the question, although I suppose that someone might. If Jonson's holograph should come to light a logical answer might present itself—but that seems a very dim hope. 10 The extent to which Jonson oversaw the printing of the masques is not clear. Herford and Simpson thought that he had nothing to do with their printing, but this assessment may need to be revised. 11 Jackson was of the opinion that only large-paper copies had the Pallas/Astraea ending (William A. Jackson, The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library, English Literature, 1475-1700 , 3 Vols., [1940], II, 575). 12 These are close to the proportions noted by Charlton Hinman in his examination of the sheets in the Shakespeare Folio of 1623: "We shall find that the earlier of the two states of a given variant forme in the Folio is often represented by about 10 per cent of the copies examined. Commonly, for example, an uncorrected state is found in some six or eight out of seventy-five copies" ( The Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2 vols. [1963], I, 229, n. 1). See, also, Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), p. 353. 13 It is understandable that Greg overlooked this detail when he concluded that for "the reversal of the final speeches in The Golden Age Restored . . . there is no typographical evidence to determine the direction of the changes" (W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration [1939-1959; rpt. 1970], III, 1072). 14 Strictly speaking, there is no significance to the number of occurrences of either the broken comma or the pulled space—one of each would be enough to sustain the argument—but of twenty copies I have recently examined which have at least one of the last two leaves, eight have the raised space. 15 ¶1 is blank; ¶2 recto is the engraved titlepage, verso blank. 16 The number depends upon certain variants; for instance, three words in the font appear on the titlepage for EMO that is printed without a border. 17 Shelf-mark 1479.1. The other large-paper sheets which have been cut down are all of quire 4I and 4P1.6. In the Folger Library there is a large-paper 1616 Folio (14751.2, Copy 2) with one small-paper quire, 3L, bound in. 18 Allan Stevenson deals with this watermark in "Watermarks are Twins," Studies in Bibliography , 4 (1951-52), 57-91. The Jonson Folio contains several varieties of the mark: Stevenson's Figure 4 reproduces one of them, and on p. 81 he describes another. The same paper was also used by Stansby for the large-paper copies of Aaron Rathbone's The Surveyor , which, as Donovan has demonstrated, was printed at the same time as the final quires of the Jonson Folio. 19 One might assume a total of 700 to 1200 copies, of which perhaps fifty or so might be large-paper. 20 Herford and Simpson note that the Pallas/Astraea ending is that reproduced in the (second) Folio of 1640 (VII, 420). All that this means is that a folio (large-paper?) with that ending was used as printer's copy; nothing more can be inferred. 21 Mercurie Vindicated and Golden Age end with—respectively—"Chorus" and "Quire." Do both terms mean that the recitation of each is in song? It is pretty clear that such is the case for "Chorus," as the parts to which it answers are described in the stage directions as songs, and it would answer in kind. As for "Quire" there is no point in calling it by that name unless song is meant. The three masques that do not end in song are The Speeches at Prince Henries Barriers, A Challange at a Tilt, at a Marriage , and Hymenaei . The first two have no songs in them; the third ends with a long, sober speech by "Truth."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Samuel Johnson and the Preface to Abbe' Prevost's Memoirs of a Man of Quality by O M Brack, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward Cave, the founder in 1731 of the Gentleman's Magazine , would have had a larger fortune, Samuel Johnson observed, "had he not rashly and wantonly impaired it by innumerable projects, of which I know not that ever one succeeded." 1 Johnson's extensive involvement in two of Cave's unsuccessful projects, the translation from the French of Pierre François Le Courayer's edition of Father Paul Sarpi's History of the Council of Trent and Jean Pierre de Crousaz's A Commentary on Mr. Pope's Principles of Morality or Essay on Man , is well known. Unknown, however, until discovered by Thomas Kaminski, is that Johnson was involved in another of Cave's publication failures, a translation from the French of Abbé Antoine François Prévost D'Exiles's novel, Memoirs et aventures d'un homme de qualité (1728-31). 2 Entitled Memoirs of a Man of Quality , the first volume of the anonymous translation was published 25 April 1738, "Printed and sold by J. Wilford," and the second volume, "Printed for E. Cave," in November 1741, but dated "1742" on the title page. 3 This essay is an examination of the extent of Johnson's contribution to the Memoirs and its textual history. What is the extent of Johnson's involvement in Cave's Memoirs of a Man of Quality ? He was not responsible for the translation of the first volume of the novel since its printing must have been virtually complete by the time Johnson began visiting St. John's Gate, Cave's office and the home of the Gentleman's Magazine . "Ad Urbanum," Johnson's first contribution to Cave's popular magazine, had appeared in March 1738. The favorable reception this poem received opened the way for Johnson to approach Cave about the publication of London , his imitation of Juvenal's third satire, and during April and early May he visited Cave to complete negotiations. Cave was taciturn, but "if at any time he was inclined to begin the discourse," Sir John Hawkins observes, "it was generally by putting a leaf of the Magazine, then in the press, into the hand of his visitor, and asking his opinion of it." 4 When Johnson visited St. John's Gate it appears not to have been a leaf of the magazine Cave thrust into his hand, however, but part of the first volume of his forthcoming Memoirs of a Man of Quality . Either on his own initiative or at the request of Cave, Johnson added to a preface apparently written by the anonymous translator the eight sentences enclosed in brackets below and, perhaps, touched up the rest. If the passages in brackets are removed, the remainder makes a complete preface in a style lacking overall Johnson's characteristic force and balance. It is on the basis of style that the passage in the preface must be attributed to Johnson—Kaminski calls the style "strikingly Johnsonian" and J. D. Fleeman "certainly persuasively SJ's"—as no external evidence appears to have survived. 5 The first draft of the preface must have been written by the translator. He begins the English translation of the Memoirs proper with the second paragraph of the French, omitting the first paragraph, except for the quotation from Ovid, which he retains for his preface. The preface, it should be noted, does not have a direct counterpart in the French edition, which has instead an "Avis de l'Editeur," written by Prévost to maintain the fiction that " Cet Ouvrage me tomba, l'automne passé, entre les mains, dans un voiage que je fis à l' Abbaye de . . . où l'Auteur s'est retire ." 6 Prévost's "Avis" was omitted in Cave's edition, undoubtedly because the first draft of the preface incorporates many of its ideas on fate, courage, and virtue. Johnson, in a less specific way, also takes some cues for his remarks from Prévost. 7 The preface is here printed from the first edition of volume one (1738), with three emendations from the second edition (1742). 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE The following Memoirs have already been so well receiv'd in the World, that there is no occasion to make any Apology for introducing them to the Reader in an English Dress. A number of People 9 who are now living have seen their Author, and they all own that, as to his Person, he was one of the handsomest Men of his Age. The Reader will find the other Part of his Character described in the following Pages; [ where he will see a brave Man struggling with the Storms of Fate: He will see Virtue oppress'd, but never over-power'd; and Villainy prosperous, but never happy: He will there perceive, that the principal Ingredient of Happiness does not lie in exterior Circumstances, but in the inward Composure of Mind. As this is the great Maxim which this Author lays down, there is scarce a Page of his Book, but what proves this important Truth; and, at the same time, that the best and the most virtuous Passion may border upon Vice, when carried too far, and when not directed by Reason and Religion. The understanding Reader will easily discern, that the Author has been a Man of Passions, so strong, that they have sometimes transported him beyond the strict Bounds of both; but at the same time he will admire how a Man, amidst such a Multitude of Events, and such a Variety of Pressures, should always find Resources in his own Courage, and superior Capacity, which have extricated him out of Difficulties, under which a Man of less Virtue and Patience would have sunk, or, by yielding to the Torrent, have exchang'd the solid Pleasures of Virtue for the gay Trappings of Vice. The Moral convey'd 10 us by every Incident of his Life, is such as may be expected from a Philosopher, and a Christian. We every where find the Satisfaction arising from Villainy transitory and delusive, and the virtuous Man rising in the home-felt Joy of Mind and Conscience, in proportion as he sinks in the Eye of the Vulgar and the Mean .] The Translator has taken the Liberty in several Instances to soften, but never to contradict the Author's Meaning. The Reason of this will appear to an English Reader, who considers the Author as a Man strictly adhering to the Religion in which he was educated, and sufficiently conscious of the Superiority which his Birth gave him over the Generality of his Readers in his own Country: So that the Dress in which the following Memoirs now appear, may suit every Man, whatever be his Religion or Quality. It may be perhaps proper 11 to acquaint the Reader, that in his Introduction to these Memoirs he says, that he had the same Reason for writing them, as Ovid had for writing Verse ; In Verse I seek the calm Content of Mind; Bless'd, if in Verse the healing Balm I find. OVID. And, notwithstanding what is advanced by the French Editor, they certainly were design'd by the Author for the Publick, since we every where find him applying to the Passions, and appealing to the Reason of his Readers. Besides, the Stile is every where chaste, lively and polite; which seldom or never is found, when the Account is no better than a few hasty Notes, put together by an Author . [ In short, the Translator may venture to affirm, That of all the numerous Productions of this kind, no Author has, equally with the Marquis, found the Secret of reconciling the Marvellous with the Probable, the Pathetic with the Noble, and Variety with Use. The Great may here view how transitory their State may prove; the Oppress'd may learn, that there is no Condition of Life so abject, but what Virtue and Patience may soften and retrieve; the Lover may here find, that nothing but Merit can lay a solid Foundation for Happiness; and every Man, be his State and Condition of Life ever so low or high, may perceive that nothing is so valuable as Sincerity and Truth.] The extent of Johnson's contribution to Cave's edition of Memoirs of a Man of Quality may be determined in part by an unsigned letter which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for May 1740 (10:252), two years after the publication of the first volume of Memoirs on 25 April 1738, calling attention to proposals allegedly issued for printing a new translation of Prévost's novel. 12 SIR, I hope for the Sake of Justice that you will give Room for a few Lines, which I imagine in some Measure relate to the Publick as well as concern your humble Servant. I shall state the Matter as short as it is possible. Proposals I am told are published for Printing by Subscription MEMOIRS of the Life and Adventures of a FRENCH Nobleman retired from the World. Written Originally in French, and now done into English . The following Character of the Work is given in the said Proposals. This Book may be compared to the Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus, with this Difference, that Mr. Fenelon conducts his Hero through a Course of imaginary Adventures; whereas our Author "the Marquis de Bretagne" (after many Singular Adventures of his own) is at last prevailed upon to abandon a Retirement, where he had resolved to pass the rest of his Days, in order to accompany the Duke of Harcourt's Son in real Travels, which present us with such Variety, that scarce any Accident can happen to a Traveller but what he may find a parallel Case, and a Pattern set before him to regulate his Conduct. After a few new introductory words ("In our Author's own Adventures, the Reader [will see a brave Man]"), it reprints as a continuous paragraph, enclosed in double quotation marks, Johnson's two passages from the 1738 preface, with revisions that tighten the wording and better fit the passage into a new context. The Preface reads, for example, " he will see a brave man . . . Fate: He will see Virtue oppress'd "; the letter places a comma after "Fate" and eliminates the second " He will see . In another instance the preface reads, " The understanding Reader will easily discern, that the Author "; the sentence is revised in the letter to indicate the author: "It will easily be discerned that 'the Marquis de Bretagne.'" Altogether there are about a dozen substantive changes. 13 After reprinting the passages by Johnson from the Preface, the letter to the Gentleman's Magazine concludes: I take leave to add, the Reader may see that the foregoing Character is taken almost Verbatim from the Preface to the first Volume of this Work, which is already Publish'd in large 12mo. pr. 3 s. 14 bound, by J. WILFORD behind the Chapterhouse, London , With this Title, MEMOIRS of a Man of Quality. Written Originally in the French Tongue by himself, after his Retirement. Now first Published in English . The Remainder is to be brought into one other Volume of the same Size: Whereas the Undertakers above propose to make their Edition, if it goes on, double the Price, viz. three Volumes in Octavo . This letter of May 1740, obviously written to puff Cave's Memoirs of a Man of Quality and to attempt to dissuade readers from buying a rival edition, raises a number of interesting questions. Although a rival translation began to be published in March 1742, no edition ever appeared with the title Memoirs of the Life and Adventures of a French Nobleman retired from the World , or in an octavo format, and there is no record of an edition issued by subscription at this time, at least in England. Had proposals been issued for a rival edition or had only a rumor reached St. John's Gate that a new translation was underway? Note that the correspondent says, "Proposals I am told are published" (italics mine). This suggests that he has not seen them, yet he goes on to say that "The following character of the work is given in the said proposals." The second paragraph, enclosed in double quotation marks, "is taken almost Verbatim from the Preface to the first Volume" of Cave's edition, as the correspondent alleges. What is most curious is that it splices together two sections of the preface which include Johnson's entire contribution. Johnson would seem to be the most likely candidate to have incorporated his own contribution into the letter, although it is possible that someone on the staff of the Gentleman's Magazine , Cave, for example, may have retained the manuscript of Johnson's separate contribution or knew what his contribution was. But the passage, it will be recalled, is alleged to have appeared in proposals for a rival edition. Were there proposals? Although it is impossible to say with certainty, it is unlikely that a rival publisher just happened to splice together the two passages by Johnson for new proposals. When it is considered that the stylistic revisions in the passages resemble those made by Johnson in other works, the likelihood of separately printed proposals containing the two passages is further diminished. The paragraph comparing Prévost's novel with François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, archbishop of Cambray's Les aventures de Télémaque , also shows signs of Johnson's hand, and is undoubtedly an attempt to couple Cave's publication with one of the most popular works in Europe during the eighteenth century. During this period Cave frequently turned to Johnson, not only to defend the Gentleman's Magazine , but also to promote various publishing projects, such as his edition of Jean Baptiste Du Halde's Description of China . 15 The most curious statement of all I am at a loss to explain. In the opening paragraph the correspondent states that the subject of his letter will "concern your humble Servant." In what way would the announcement of a rival edition affect Johnson? Was he at work translating the second volume of Memoirs ? Although there is no convincing evidence that Johnson had a hand in the translation, he may have worked on it, nonetheless. Kaminski has shown that during the early years of his employment by Cave, Johnson worked primarily as a translator. Sir John Hawkins observes of Johnson's translation from the French of Father Jerome Lobo's A Voyage to Abyssinia that "Were we to rest our judgment on internal evidence, Johnson's claim to the title of translator of this work would be disputable; it has scarce a feature resembling him." 16 Cave's edition of Prévost's novel, Memoirs of a Man of Quality , had languished after the publication of the first volume on 25 April 1738. Word that a new translation was about to appear seems to have alarmed Cave enough that he asked Johnson to write a letter puffing his edition in the May 1740 Gentleman's Magazine , concluding with a reminder that the first volume was available and that the "Remainder is to be brought into one other Volume of the same Size." But there were further delays. A year later, in the May 1741 issue of the magazine, readers were told that volume one was " Now first Published in English " and that volume two " is in the Press, and almost finished " (11:280). In fact the second volume was not announced in the magazine as published until November 1741 (11:614). The first volume had been published with the imprint "Printed and sold by J. Wilford, behind the Chapter-House in St Paul's Churchyard." The second volume, however, bears the imprint "Printed for E. Cave, at St. John's Gate," with a notice underneath: "Where may be had Volume I." At the beginning of the volume, in an advertisement not written by Johnson but which includes an awkward paraphrase of his comparison of the works of Fénelon and Prévost, the reader is told that "the first volume of the translation of these Memoirs was published some time ago, and so well received, that the continuation was very much desired, particularly by the ladies," adding, "but though the publication of it has been long retarded by unforeseen impediments, it is hoped their curiosity is not abated." The nature of the "unforeseen impediments" can only be conjectured. If Johnson was responsible in some way for all or part of the translation of the second volume, as suggested above, this might have caused a delay in its publication. Johnson was notoriously dilatory in producing copy for his translations but also was out of Cave's employ from June 1739 until at least April 1740. 17 Perhaps, as A. D. Barker suggests, "it was the congestion in [Cave] and [Thomas] Gardner's affairs in 1738-40" that "delayed the appearance of the second volume." 18 A more likely explanation for a delay was the low sales of the first volume. Unwilling to invest additional money in a failure, Cave may have stalled on publishing a second volume until a rival translation threatened his investment in the first volume. Evidence for the low sales of the first volume of Memoirs is the reissuing by Cave of the first edition sheets of volume one with the two preliminary leaves containing the title page and preface reset. On the new title page he changed the imprint to read "London: Printed for E. Cave, at St. John's Gate. M DCC XLII," and called it the "SECOND EDITION." The only portion of the book that is a second edition is the preface. In the process of resetting the preface, three textual revisions are introduced which may well be by Johnson. 19 Although there is no external evidence, the first volume was probably reissued about the time the second volume was published in November 1741. In the February 1742 Gentleman's Magazine Cave published a second letter puffing the Memoirs . The letter, which shows no sign of Johnson's hand, is signed "F. S." and recommends the work highly (12:95). Cave's attempt to forestall a rival with the publication of the May 1740 letter in the Gentleman's Magazine ultimately failed, although it may have allowed him time to complete work on his second volume. A new translation was published in Dublin in early March 1741/42: The Memoirs and Adventures of the Marquis de Bretagne, and Duc D'Harcourt. Written Originally in French; and Now done into English, By Mr. Erskine , Dublin: Printed by Oli. Nelson, at Milton's Head in Skinner-Row, For the Translator, M DCC XLI. 20 Mr. Erskine includes a "Preface by the French Editor," translated from Prévost's original, and a "Preface by the Translator." The first paragraph of this preface begins by quoting from the 1740 letter in the Gentleman's Magazine beginning with "In our Author's own Adventures" through "the Vulgar and the Mean," with several revisions: "observe" is changed to " perceive ," "discerned" to " observed ," "he has been sometimes transported" to " he was often transported ," "should always have found resources" to " should have found Means ," "which have extricated him" to " to extricate himself ," and "would have sunk" to " must have sunk ." Erskine's concluding sentence to this first paragraph is representative of his style: " In short, to sum up his Character in one Word, never was there a more loving Husband, a more tender Father, a more faithful Guide, or a Man more solidly virtuous ." He begins his second and final paragraph with a revised version of Johnson's comparison between the works of Fénelon and Prévost in the May 1740 letter: " His Travels with the Duc d'Harcourt' s Son may be justly enough compared to the Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus, with this Difference, that Mr. Fenelon makes Mentor conduct his Hero through a Course of imaginary Adventures, whereas our Author accompanies a young Nobleman in real Travels, attended with such a Variety of Events, that scarce any Accident can happen to a Traveller, but what he may find a parallel Case . . . ." That Erskine's source for the passages by Johnson is this letter and not the preface to the Memoirs is clear. He not only uses the passage on Fénelon and Prévost but incorporates variant readings not found in the preface, right down to following the letter's spelling "villany" instead of "villainy." 21 Was this the new translation for which the proposals were written? It would seem not. Often the account of a work in the proposals is included with little change as a prefatory piece to a work when published, as Johnson does for both the Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae and the Harleian Miscellany , for example. 22 Having already written an account for the proposals which would serve well as a preface, why chop up the account and rewrite it in an undistinguished style which would scarcely disguise that it had been plagiarized? As might be expected from Johnson, he emphasizes, especially in the final two sentences of the preface, that the appeals of Prévost's novel are virtue, patience, sincerity, and truth. Both Erskine's preface and the advertisements in the newspapers, however, play up the Protagonist's youthful adventures and the love interest. This explains why Erskine omitted Johnson's two concluding sentences from his preface. A new edition, "Translated from the original French By Mr. Erskine," with his preface, appeared in London 13 November 1742, although the imprint says 1743: The Memoirs and Adventures of the Marquis de Bretagne, and Duc D'Harcourt: or, The Wonderful Vicissitudes of Fortune, Exemplified in the Lives of Those Noblemen. To Which is Added, The History of the Chevalier de Grieu and Moll Lescaut, an Extravagant Love-Adventure , "Printed for T. Cooper, at the Globe in Pater-noster-Row." 23 Cave continued to have difficulties selling the Memoirs of a Man of Quality . In April 1744 he began to use Joseph Collyer as his publisher and gave him unsold sheets of old publications to sell in fascicules, often under different titles. 24 The Supplement to the Gentleman's Magazine for 1744 (published in January 1745), under a running head of "Books publish'd periodically, January 1745," has the following entry: "XVI Memoirs of a man of quality. Giving an account of many surprizing adventures, in his travels thro' England, France, Germany, Turkey, Spain, Portugal and Italy . The whole about fifteen numbers, at 4 d. each. Collyer ." 25 This effort at promotion also failed and Cave was still advertising the two volumes as late as 1753. 26 Editions of various translations of Prévost's novel continued to be published in the eighteenth century. The General Advertiser for 28 April 1747 announced a new translation, Memoirs of a Man of Honour , printed for John Nourse. In fact, the translation and the preface are different from those found in the Cave and Erskine editions. 27 Then in 1770 a "second edition" of the Erskine translation was published in Dublin, printed for James Williams. 28 More importantly, in 1770 "A NEW EDITION" of Memoirs of a Man of Quality , was published in London, printed for Francis Newbery. 29 This is the translation originally published by Cave, with the preface to which Johnson contributed reprinted from the 1738 first edition, thus omitting the three revisions made for the 1742 second edition. This "third edition" of the preface has the usual compositorial variations: many of the capitals on substantives reduced to lower case, the "'d" of the past tense changed to "ed," and an occasional punctuation mark altered. Also in the 1770 edition, the third sentence of the first paragraph is changed from " this " to " our " in " Maxim which this Author lays down ," and in the first sentence of the second paragraph " to " is omitted in " but never to contradict the Author's Meaning ." None of these changes in the "third edition" need be attributed to Johnson. In summary, Johnson's contributions to the Memoirs were the additions and, perhaps, revisions to the 1738 preface; the May 1740 letter to the Gentleman's Magazine , including the revisions to the passages from the 1738 preface quoted in the letter; and the revisions to the 1742 preface.</field>

The second volume was listed in the November 1741 Gentleman's Magazine (11:614). John Wilford was one of the founders of the Gentleman's Magazine's chief rival, the London Magazine , and until his bankruptcy in 1735, he owned a one-fifth share and managed another one-fifth share for the magazine's printer, Charles Ackers. See D. F. McKenzie and J. C. Ross, eds., A Ledger of Charles Ackers Printer of the London Magazine , Oxford Bibliographical Society Publications, n.s. 15 (Oxford, 1968), 5-9. Cave used Wilford as a trade publisher from September 1737 until 1741. For Cave's relationship with John Wilford, see A. D. Barker, "Edward Cave, Samuel Johnson, and the Gentleman's Magazine " (D.Phil. thesis, Oxford University, 1981), 68-71. The evidence of the type ornaments indicates that the volumes were printed by Cave, or perhaps by Thomas Gardner to whom Cave gave some of his extra printing (Barker, 68 and Appendix K). 4 Life of Samuel Johnson , 2d ed. (London, 1787), 47-48. 5 Kaminski, 198, and Fleeman's forthcoming bibliography of the writings of Samuel Johnson. There has been a continuous tradition of attributions of works to Johnson on the basis of style since his own lifetime. When James Boswell came to compile his list of attributions for his Life of Samuel Johnson which, rightly or wrongly, has served as the basic guide to Johnson's canon, his work was greatly assisted by previously published accounts. See The Early Biographies of Samuel Johnson , ed. O M Brack, Jr. and Robert E. Kelley (1974), passim. For an overview of attributions of works to Johnson from the beginnings until 1962, see Donald J. Greene, "The Development of the Johnsonian Canon," in Restoration and Eighteenth Century Literature: Essays in Honor of Alan Dugald McKillop , ed. Carroll Camden (1963), 407-427. 6 Memoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité (Amsterdam, 1735) in the British Library. 7 Kaminski, 256 n.7. 8 The text is taken from the first edition and sight collated with the second edition; both copies are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Copies of the first edition in the British Library and the Huntington Library and copies of the second edition in the British Library, Beinecke Library, Yale University, and the Loren and Frances Rothschild Collection, Los Angeles, have also been bibliographically examined and the prefaces sight collated. No variation was discovered within copies of each edition of the preface. 9 The 1738 edition reads " A great many people ." 10 The 1738 edition reads "Moral that is convey'd ." 11 The 1738 edition reads " convenient ." 12 The letter, which fills a column and a half, has as a running head: "Character of the Memoirs of a Man of Quality ." The announcement in the General Evening Post (31 May-3 June) that the May 1740 issue of the Gentleman's Magazine had been published 2 June lists the table of contents, which includes "Character of the Memoirs of a Man of Quality." I have been unable to locate a copy of the proposals, and a search of the April and May 1740 issues of the following newspapers has failed to turn up an advertisement for them: Daily Gazetteer, Daily Post, General Evening Post, London Daily Post and General Advertiser, London Evening Post , and London Gazette . Also, no mention of a new translation is made in the London Magazine , the Gentleman's Magazine's chief rival. 13 A full list of variants appears at the end of the letter, published as "Character of the Memoirs of a Man of Quality . 1740" in The Shorter Prose Writings of Samuel Johnson , ed. O M Brack, Jr. (New York: AMS Press, 1994). 14 In fact, both volumes are duodecimos in half sheets. A full description is forthcoming in J. D. Fleeman's bibliography of the writings of Samuel Johnson. 15 Johnson's editorial contributions to the Gentleman's Magazine are canvassed by Kaminski and many of the items will appear in The Shorter Prose Writings of Samuel Johnson . 16 Kaminski, 61-82; Hawkins, Life , 22. Johnson's translation of Crousaz's Commentary would probably have gone unrecognized had he not added footnotes. Any attempt to identify a work as Johnson's on the basis of translation technique is fraught with difficulties. Most of his techniques are those used by other professional writers, such as Tobias Smollett. For a discussion of some of the problems in identifying Johnson as a translator, see O M Brack, Jr., and Thomas Kaminski, "Johnson, James, and the Medicinal Dictionary," Modern Philology 81 (1984), 378-400. 17 See Letters of Samuel Johnson , ed. Bruce Redford (1992), 19, 21; Kaminski, 106-108. 18 Barker, 62. See n. 3 above. 19 The three variants are given in the notes to the preface. Although the stylistic revisions cannot be attributed to Johnson with certainty, this is the kind of editorial tinkering he was doing on the lives of Blake and Drake about this time. See O M Brack, Jr., "The Gentleman's Magazine , Concealed Printing, and the Text of Samuel Johnson's Lives of Admiral Robert Blake and Sir Francis Drake," Studies in Bibliography , 40 (1987), 140-146. 20 The Dublin News-Letter of 27 February—2 March 1741/42 advertised as "Just Published. The Translation of the First French Volume of the Memoirs and Adventures of the Marquis de Bretagne and Duke d'Harcourt ." A new "French Volume" was advertised at regular intervals and then the Dublin News-Letter for 13-17 July 1742 announced the publication of "three volumes, Price 9s." I am grateful to Laurence and Jonathan Avery for bibliographically examining the 1741 Dublin edition in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library and supplying me with photocopies of relevant pages. 21 In one instance, the change of "observe" to " perceive ," Erskine restores a reading found in the preface but not in the letter. This is probably a coincidence since all other readings which appear only in the letter are followed. The variant readings between the preface and the letter are included in the Shorter Prose Writings of Samuel Johnson . Although beyond the scope of this study, it would be interesting to know if Erskine used Cave's edition to assist him in making his translation. 22 Tobias Smollett includes the accounts written for the proposals for his Complete History of England, Continuation of the Complete History of England , and the Present State of All Nations as introductions to these works. See O M Brack, Jr., "Tobias Smollett Puffs his Histories," in Writers, Books, and Trade , ed. O M Brack, Jr. (New York: AMS Press, 1993), 267-288. 23 London Evening Post , 11-13 November 1742, "Beautifully printed in three pocket volumes, 12mo." It was also listed in the catalogue of new books in the London Magazine for November 1742 (11:572). It was advertised in the London Evening Post for 3-5 March 1743 as "Beautifully printed in Three Volumes Twelves . . . Printed for M. Cooper." Thomas Cooper died 9 February 1743 and his widow, Mary, had taken over the business. See Michael Treadwell, "London Trade Publishers 1675-1750," Library , 6th ser., 4 (1982), 111. What seems to be the same edition is listed as the first item under the heading "Lately Publish'd, Printed for C. Hitch, at the Red-Lion in Pater-noster-Row" in the General Advertiser for 22, 23, 24 April 1747. For purposes of collating the texts, I have used the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. I have also bibliographically examined the copies in the British Library and the Huntington Library. 24 For Cave's relationship with Collyer, see Barker, 209-214. 25 This is the only edition sold in numbers listed by R. M. Wiles in Serial Publication in England Before 1750 (1957), 342. Wiles identifies the Collyer edition as identical to Cave's. 26 The work appears as item 23 in an undated advertisement, "Books Printed for E. Cave at St. John's Gate," bound at the end of A General Index to the First Twenty Volumes of the Gentleman's Magazine (London, 1753) in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Although the advertisement is a separately printed gathering, it could not have been printed earlier than 1753, as it advertises the third edition of The Entire Works of Dr. Thomas Sydenham , to which Johnson's life was prefixed, published that year. 27 It was also the seventh item in the register of books in the May 1747 issue of the Gentleman's Magazine (17:252). I have examined the copy in the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, Los Angeles. A facsimile of the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, appears in "The Flowering of the Novel Series" of Garland Publishing (1975). 28 Although this was the "second" edition published in Dublin, it was the "third" edition of the Erskine translation, as one had been published in London. I have examined the British Library copy, available in the ESTC microfilm series. 29 S. Roscoe, John Newbery and His Successors, 1740-1814. A Bibliography (Wormley, Herts.: Five Owls Press, 1973), A426. I have examined the British Library copy, available in the ESTC microfilm series. The query on Oliver Goldsmith as translator in this copy should be ignored.

      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Love Peacock's Manuscript "Poems" of 1804 by Nicholas A. Joukovsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Love Peacock began writing poetry as a schoolboy at Englefield Green, submitted a prize-winning poem to a juvenile magazine as a fourteen-year-old clerk in the City of London, and published his first volume of poetry in November or December 1805, shortly after his twentieth birthday. 1 Although most reviewers treated Palmyra, and Other Poems indulgently, the volume was a financial failure, and Peacock later dismissed it as "a very juvenile production." 2 When he published a combined "Second Edition" of The Genius of the Thames, Palmyra, and Other Poems in 1812, he included only the two longest poems from his first volume, and even these were heavily revised. On 11 November 1811, he remarked in a letter to his friend Thomas Forster: "Ballantyne is printing a second edition of the Genius of the Thames, Palmyra, and Fiolfar, together with an Inscription for a mountain-dell, being its first appearance on any stage. Palmyra is quite a new thing, about half as long as before, and containing little more than a fifth of the original lines. The King of Norway too stalks forth in a new suit of armour. All my other poems I consign to the tomb of the Capulets." 3 If nearly all his earliest published poems were thus consigned to oblivion, it is hardly surprising that the same fate should have overtaken Peacock's unpublished juvenilia, the bulk of which remained wholly unknown until the 1920s, when two important manuscript collections came to light. Unfortunately, only one of these sources was available for inclusion in the standard Halliford edition of Peacock's Works , which was in progress from 1924 to 1934. The first of these manuscript collections was appended to a copy of the first edition of Palmyra, and Other Poems in a contemporary calf binding, purchased by Michael Sadleir from a "country bookseller" in August 1923 and now in the Robert H. Taylor Collection of the Princeton University Library. Bound at the back of this volume are 104 extra leaves, the first thirty-seven of which contain transcripts of twenty-three "Additional Poems | by | Thomas Love Peacock | Chiefly written at an | early age"—all dated in a list of "Contents." Since the additional poems are dated from January 1801 to January 1804 and the extra leaves contain an 1806 watermark, it seems likely that the transcripts were made within a few years of the publication of Palmyra by or for someone in Peacock's family who had access to a large quantity of his early verse in manuscript. 4 From this volume the Halliford editors derived texts of twenty previously unknown poems by Peacock. However, their satisfaction with the discovery was somewhat dampened by their inability to gain access to another manuscript volume that was advertised by a Southend bookseller in the Publisher's Circular on 4 February 1928, and "promptly bought by a London dealer, who refused to let it be seen, but stated in May that he had sold it to an American customer." 5 This manuscript book—which has now been available to scholars for more than half a century in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library, but has not hitherto been described in detail—contains twenty-eight early poems in Peacock's own hand, all arranged in chronological order and carefully dated from June 1798 to September 1804. While only four of the poems are hitherto unpublished, the Berg MS makes valuable additions to our knowledge of the canon, chronology, text, and literary antecedents of Peacock's juvenilia. 6 The Berg MS is a large quarto manuscript book entitled "Poems, | by | T. L. Peacock." The entire volume consists of seventy-eight leaves measuring 11 5/8 inches by 9 3/16 inches, bound in full diced calf, with gilt tooling, gilt edges, and marbled endpapers. The title "POEMS" is stamped in gilt on the spine. Peacock's original manuscript evidently consisted of sixty-eight leaves of wove paper containing the watermark "John Hays | 1803". To these the binder added ten leaves of laid paper (five at the beginning and five at the end) with the watermark "Russell &amp; Edmeads | 1799". The recto of the second leaf of wove paper contains the title, followed by an epigraph from Martial. The first and third leaves of wove paper are blank, as is the verso of the title leaf. The text of the twenty-eight poems is written in Peacock's neat copperplate hand on both sides of the next forty-one leaves, which are paginated from 1 to 82. Each poem begins on a new page, and each is dated at the end. The handwriting resembles that of Peacock's fair copy of his contemporaneous verse drama "The Circle of Loda," which is also written on both sides of the leaf, with similar page numbering. 7 The remaining twenty-four leaves of wove paper were left blank by Peacock, though he may at first have intended to reserve them for additional poems. The style of the binding and the date of the watermark in the binder's leaves both suggest that the manuscript was bound at an early date—probably not long after Peacock finished copying the poems in September or October 1804. The subsequent history of the volume is obscure. Almost the only thing that can be concluded with certainty is that the Berg MS was not available to the copyist of the Sadleir-Taylor MS. A pair of brief penciled notes on pages 34 and 35 appear to have been added by someone familiar with the neighborhood of Chertsey, for one of them identifies the subject of Peacock's poem "On the Death of M r Pembroke" as the father of the Rev. Charles Pembroke, who became Rector of Weybridge and Curate of Chertsey in 1827 and died around 1847. 8 Some time after 1847, an unidentified antiquary used eleven blank leaves at the end of the book—turning it upside down and beginning from the back on the third binder's leaf—for a manuscript index to Michel-Ange de La Chausse's Romanum Museum, sive Thesaurus Eruditae Antiquitatis , originally published in 1690, followed by transcriptions of the title pages of two books: an edition of Tasso's Aminta published at Oxford in 1726 and the second edition of Thomas Forster's Original Letters of John Locke, Alg. Sidney, and Lord Shaftesbury , privately printed in London in 1847. The handwriting—or rather hand printing—of this second set of additions is very different from that of the penciled notes; it does not appear to be Forster's, and it is certainly not Peacock's. While the strict chronological arrangement of the poems makes it seem most unlikely that the Berg MS was prepared with a view to publication, it would appear that the volume was intended as a more or less comprehensive collection of the poems that Peacock thought worthy of circulation and preservation in September or October 1804. Its contents include two-thirds of the poems he is known to have written during the period that it covers, and most of the omissions are relatively easy to explain. The "Answer to the Question, 'Is History or Biography the More Improving Study?'" was a mere exercise, and in any case it had been published in The Monthly Preceptor, or Juvenile Library for February 1800. The two "Epigrams" (January 1801) might have been rejected as too trifling, the verse letter "Liberty" (January 1801) as too full of personified abstractions or too politically outspoken, the verse letter to his grandfather Love (11 August 1801) as too topical or too crudely patriotic, and the fragment "From the Revelations" (? 1801) as too enthusiastic—if, indeed, they were not simply deemed inferior work. More personal considerations are likely to have influenced the omission of all eight of the poems that may be associated with Lucretia Oldham, "the beauty of Shacklewell Green," with whom Peacock appears to have been in love at least from November 1802 to November 1803. 9 Perhaps Peacock looked back on his adolescent infatuation with some degree of regret or embarrassment, or perhaps he merely wished to avoid any exposure of his personal feelings or personal relationships. In any case, it is worth noting in this connection that even the four verse letters in the Berg MS contain almost no personal information about the writer or the unidentified recipients. The twenty-eight poems that Peacock included in the Berg MS contain almost nine hundred lines of verse in a variety of genres as well as a variety of metrical and stanzaic forms. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the collection is the high proportion of satirical and humorous pieces—about a third of the total number, including most of the longer poems. In this respect, the Berg MS contrasts sharply with the Palmyra volume, in which the only two humorous pieces are relegated to a section of "Nugæ" at the end. Although the presence of three imitations of Ossian should not surprise anyone who has read Byron's Hours of Idleness , it is surprising to find no imitations or translations of the classics—which may be a sign of diffidence in the young self-educated scholar. Of the four new poems, the earliest—a schoolboy effusion entitled "Midsummer Holidays. | Written at twelve years of age."—is the most revealing, for it is the only poem Peacock is known to have written between the ages of nine and fourteen. Apart from this specimen of very early work, all the poems were written between his fifteenth and nineteenth birthdays. As an independent collection in which the poems are chronologically arranged and carefully dated, the Berg MS is the only contemporary document that allows us to trace the development of Peacock's versification. Each poem is dated at the end, at least with the month and year, but in seven cases with the day of the month as well. Since more than half its dates are not recorded elsewhere, the Berg MS makes an important contribution to the chronology of Peacock's early work. For eleven of the poems the Berg MS confirms the dating of the Sadleir-Taylor MS or some other source, and for two more its dating differs only slightly from that of other manuscripts. On the other hand, for fourteen of the poems the Berg MS provides the only available evidence, or in two cases the only precise evidence, for dating. It also gives the correct date for "Peace," which is obviously misdated in the Sadleir-Taylor MS. 10 Perhaps the most important contribution of the Berg MS to the chronology of Peacock's verse is its establishment of early dates for seven of the eight poems that he later included in Palmyra, and Other Poems . With the exception of "To a Young Lady Netting," which is dated October 1803 in a separate manuscript in the Pforzheimer Collection, 11 the remaining poems in the Palmyra volume are all likely to have been written between October 1804 and October 1805, after the completion of the Berg MS. The dating of two of the latest poems in the Berg MS also has significant implications for dating the manuscript of "The Circle of Loda" and the private printing of The Monks of St. Mark . An "Ancient War-Song" dated August 1804 in the Berg MS also appears as the opening "Chorus of Bards" in Peacock's undated verse drama "The Circle of Loda," which is written on paper with an 1801 watermark. 12 Since it seems unlikely that Peacock would have included one, and only one, of the lyrics from a finished drama in a collection of his shorter poems, it is reasonable to suppose that the "Ancient War-Song" was originally written as an independent work and only later incorporated into "The Circle of Loda." This would suggest that "The Circle of Loda" was written late in 1804 or early in 1805, before Peacock recast some of the material from the drama in the narrative form of "Fiolfar, King of Norway," which was published with Palmyra . The appearance of "The Monks of S t Mark" in the Berg MS plays an important part in a more complex argument for redating the rare private printing of that poem. 13 The octavo half-sheet containing The Monks of St. Mark has always been dated 1804 because at the end the poem is dated September 1804. But Peacock often dated his manuscript poems in this manner, and the Berg MS confirms that September 1804 was the date of composition—not necessarily the date of printing. Indeed, if Peacock had printed the poem at that time, it is unlikely that he would have taken the trouble to copy it into the Berg MS. Moreover, the fact that The Monks of St. Mark was printed by Thomas Bensley, the printer of the Palmyra volume, in the same typographical style, on the same size paper, with the same font of type, the same measure, the same page length, and the same kind of headline strongly suggests that The Monks of St. Mark was printed at the same time as Palmyra , in the autumn of 1805. Since the typographical similarities are too striking to be a matter of coincidence, there would appear to be three possible ways to account for the relationship between the two works. (1) The Monks could have been set in type as a specimen of the typographical style to be employed in the Palmyra volume. (2) The Monks could have been originally intended for inclusion in the Palmyra volume but removed from the book after the poem had been set in type. (3) The Monks could have been deliberately printed in the same style as the Palmyra volume, either while the volume was being printed or shortly thereafter. The third supposition seems somewhat less plausible than the others, mainly because the lack of a separate title page, with the consequent odd placement of the printer's imprint at the bottom of the first page of text, suggests that The Monks of St. Mark was not planned as a separately printed work. In addition to the texts of four wholly or partially unpublished poems, the Berg MS provides substantive variants in the text, title, or epigraph of all but one of the twenty-four previously published pieces. For the eight poems published with Palmyra , as well as for The Monks of St. Mark , most of the textual variants in the Berg MS are early readings that Peacock subsequently rejected, but in the case of "Levi Moses" the Berg MS has two or three dialect spellings that are likely to have been unintentionally normalized, either by Peacock himself or by the compositor of the Palmyra volume. The textual situation is very different for the fifteen posthumously published poems, only three of which have survived in any other holograph manuscript. For the remaining twelve—and especially for the ten that are otherwise available only in the carelessly copied Sadleir-Taylor MS—the Berg MS offers many textual improvements, both in substantives and in accidentals. In several cases the Sadleir-Taylor MS appears to have been copied from early versions, if not rough drafts. Its texts of the satirical verse letters "Sir Peter Bohea" and "The Alarmists" are often corrupt, and its text of "Paddy's Lamentation" normalizes most of the dialect of the comic Irishman. The superiority of the Berg MS is particularly evident in the consistent texture of its accidentals, including its underlining for emphasis and its characteristically heavy punctuation. Although it has its share of errors incidental to copying, most of these involve such minor matters as omission of underlining or quotation marks. The Berg MS should, then, provide the copy-text for at least sixteen of the poems in any future edition of Peacock's poetical works. At least a few of the dozen variant titles throw some kind of new light on the poems in question, most notably the subtitle identifying "The Monks of S t Mark" as "A Tale of Wonder." But perhaps the most interesting additions to the existing text are thirteen otherwise unrecorded epigraphs. Taken as a group, these new epigraphs not only reflect Peacock's literary taste but also suggest that the range of his early reading may have been more limited than has often been thought. Of the nine new Latin epigraphs, six are from the first book of Horace's Odes , while two more are from Virgil's Eclogues (the other one is an anonymous tag). The only Greek epigraph is from the Anacreontea , the two Italian ones are from Ariosto and Metastasio, and the only English one is from Pope. Since most of the poems in the Berg MS survive in other manuscript or printed versions, it is surely surprising that only two of its fifteen epigraphs appear elsewhere: the passage from Juvenal that introduces "Levi Moses" in the Palmyra volume and the line from Il Pastor Fido that identifies the source of the "Translation from the Italian of Guarini" in the 1875 edition of Peacock's Works . The Palmyra volume is, to be sure, somewhat more sparing than the Berg MS in its use of epigraphs, but the omission of all epigraphs from the Sadleir-Taylor MS suggests that the copyist simply ignored them—either because she did not consider them important or because she did not know Latin or Italian. Even if many of the new epigraphs are more decorative than functional, they clearly testify to the care with which Peacock prepared the Berg MS. Since it would be impractical to reproduce the entire text of the Berg MS, I instead provide a poem-by-poem description of its contents, including a detailed collation of the previously published poems with the texts in Volumes 6 and 7 of the Halliford edition of Peacock's Works . The entry for each poem contains the following details, to the extent that they are applicable and/or available. (1) The title, followed by the page(s) of the MS on which the poem appears. (2) The epigraph, if any, with a line reference and a translation. (3) The date which appears at the end of the poem. (4) Details of other manuscript or printed texts, including variants in title, epigraph, or date. (5) Reference to the text in the Halliford edition with which the manuscript has been collated. (6) Substantive variants, followed by separate lists of variants in capitalization, underlining or italics, hyphenation, elision, or spelling—but only the most significant variants in punctuation. 14 (7) The full text of the poem if it is wholly or substantially unpublished. (8) Miscellaneous notes on sources, analogues, influences, quotations, or other matters of literary interest. In the case of substantive variants, the reading of the Berg MS follows a lemma containing the reading of the Halliford edition. In the separate lists of non-verbal variants, all readings are those of the Berg MS. The only silent changes I have made in quoting Peacock's MSS have been to omit the dots under superscript letters, to omit the superfluous quotation marks at the beginning of each new line of a quotation, and to regularize the number of ellipsis points to three.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Contents of the Manuscript General title: "Poems, | by | T. L. Peacock." Epigraph (below title): "Nos hæc novimus esse nihil. | Mart:" [ Epigrams , XIII.ii.8: "I know these things to be worthless"]. John Cam Hobhouse, who became one of the closest friends of Peacock's later years, used the same epigraph on the title page of his Imitations and Translations from the Ancient and Modern Classics, Together with Original Poems Never Before Published (1809). Both Peacock and Hobhouse would have expected their readers to remember that the passage in Martial continues for two more lines: "non tamen hoc nimium nihil est, si candidus aure | nec matutina si mihi fronte venis" ("and yet they are not absolutely worthless, if you come to me with a just ear, and not with an early morning frown"). (1) "Midsummer Holidays. | Written at twelve years of age."—pp. 1-2. Date: "June 1798." Previously unpublished. The happy day at last is come, We're ready all to hasten home, We all in uproar are: French Greek and Latin! all adieu! We now no more remember you. We fly away from care. The boxes bring: the stage is here: To London now our course we steer, Devoid of grief and sorrow; We think not of our future fate, But joyfully anticipate Where we shall be tomorrow. When now at last arriv'd in town, Deliver'd from the master's frown, We haste to meet our friends; No more we cry, no more we fret; We seem entirely to forget, That holidays have ends. The reference to "our future fate" is reminiscent of Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College," 51-60. Biographically, it is interesting to note that Peacock was taking the stagecoach to London rather than some local conveyance to his grandfather's cottage at Chertsey, where he is said to have spent his vacations. Apparently he did not realize, when he wrote this carefree poem, that his schooldays, as well as his holidays, would soon come to an end. According to his own account in a letter to Thomas L'Estrange of 23 June 1862, he left John Harris Wicks's private school at Englefield Green before he turned thirteen on 18 October 1798 ( Works , 8:259).

It is not clear whether this verse letter was written a month before it was sent to Peacock's grandmother, or whether the 16 June date in the Berg and Sadleir-Taylor MSS is a slip for 16 July taken over from earlier MSS. The text of the Berg MS is much closer to that of the letter than to that of the Sadleir-Taylor MS, which contains a number of corrupt readings and appears to have been based on an early version or rough draft.

Brett-Smith recognized that the January 1801 date in the Sadleir-Taylor MS was too early and suggested that it was an error for January 1802— Works , l:xxviii, note. However, the October 1801 date in the Berg MS is certainly correct, for preliminary articles of peace were signed in London on 1 October 1801, leading eventually to the Treaty of Amiens on 27 March 1802.

The Berg MS reveals a number of textual corruptions in the Sadleir-Taylor MS, which may have been copied from an early version or rough draft. (10) "From the seventeenth chapter of Isaiah."—pp. 30-31. Date: "May 24: 1802." Transcript titled "Paraphrase from the 17 Chap r Isaiah | May 24, 1802." in the Sadleir-Taylor MS, pp. 12-13.

Within quotation marks, but not underlined: "Like Autumn's leaves the present race decays, | Another race succeeds." (16-17). I have not identified this quotation, which is strongly reminiscent of Homer, Iliad , vi.146-149. After the title, Mr. Pembroke is identified in pencil in an unknown hand: "(of Chertsey) | (Father of the Rev. Charles Pembroke)". An obituary notice in the Gentleman's Magazine for October 1802 indicates that "Charles Pembroke, esq. attorney at law" died on 25 September 1802, at Chertsey, "in his 45th year" (72:979). Peacock's change of title may have been prompted by Mrs. Sewell's poem "On the Death of Charles Pembroke, Esq. of Chertsey. 1802," published in her Poems , pp. 247-248 (see no. 16, below). (13) "Slender's Love-Elegy."—pp. 37-39. Epigraph: Xαλεòν Τò —ὴ øιλῆσαι, | Xαλεòν δέ Καί øιλῆσαι, | XαλεπΤερον δέ i áνΤων | A i οΤυγχáνειν øιλοῦνΤα. | ANAKPEΩN.

Quotation marks around the refrain in lines 16, 32, and 40. The refrain is, of course, from The Merry Wives of Windsor , III.i.70 and 114. However, Peacock's poem also owes something to William Shenstone's "Slender's Ghost," with its similar refrain, "O sweet! O sweet Anne Page!"— The Works in Verse and Prose of William Shenstone, Esq. , 2 vols. (1764), 1:216-217. (14) "Translation | From the Italian of Guarini."—pp. 40-41.

The village of Shacklewell, near Hackney, was the residence of Lucretia Oldham—"the beauty of Shacklewell Green"—for whom Peacock wrote a number of poems between November 1802 and November 1803. The "friend at Guernsey" was also the addressee of "Letter to a friend" (no. 20, below), which is titled "To a friend at Guernsey" in the Sadleir-Taylor MS. Since he was evidently a member of Peacock's circle of friends in the vicinity of Hackney, I have speculated elsewhere that he may have been William de St. Croix, whose father was born in Jersey—see my "Peacock before Headlong Hall ," pp. 13-14.

Jack Allspice late in Wapping dwelt, In coffee, tea, and snuff he dealt, And all before him carried: He saw, and lov'd, a blithsome maid, With joy he found his love repaid, And little Jack was married.

"Friend Jack! amongst the sons of men, These things will happen now and then, Repine not thus at fate: But learn this truth, you silly loon, The child came not at all too soon , Your marriage came too late !"

See Works , 6:71-72. Last two stanzas previously unpublished. Rosalia . . . farewell! Fate has doom'd us to part; But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart; No longer is love with my reason at strife, Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life. As together we roam'd, I the passion confess'd, Which thy beauty and virtue had rais'd in my breast; That the passion was mutual, thou mad'st me believe, And I thought my Rosalia could never deceive ! My Rosalia! no! false one! my claims I resign; Thou can'st not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine! I now scorn thee as much as I lov'd thee before, Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more. Thou love! no, Rosalia! debase not the name, Not in bosoms like thine glows so noble a flame; Thine was felt without pleasure, was lost without sorrow, Thou could'st love me to-day, and forget me tomorrow! Thy breast swells with joy at the thought of my pain, But I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain , Though I once thought it death from Rosalia to sever, With a smile I can leave thee, and leave thee for ever! The interchangeability of the names Rosalia and Matilda—both of which were common in Gothic novels—suggests that they have no biographical significance.

The name Tlamín is accented in the title and the first heading, but not afterwards. The readings of the Berg MS almost always agree with those of the Pforzheimer MS. Peacock's source—misidentified in Shelley and His Circle —is the note to Temora: An Epic Poem , Book VIII, beginning "Tla-min, mildly soft . . ." ( Ossian , ed. Jiriczek, 2:146).

The subtitle is helpful in establishing the literary origins of Peacock's poem, which is evidently an experiment in the comic vein of Matthew Gregory Lewis's Tales of Wonder , 2 vols. (1801). Lewis's celebrated collection contains a good deal of humor and self-parody, most notably in his parody of his own "Alonzo the Brave and Fair Imogine" in "Giles Jollop the Grave, and Brown Sally Green" (1:26-30), and in the anonymous parody of "The Erl-King" and "The Cloud King" in "The Cinder King" (2:416-418). The six-line anapestic stanza of The Monks of St. Mark is found in only one poem in Lewis's collection: H. Bunbury's "The Little Grey Man" (1:113-121). (28) "Maria's return to her native cottage."—pp. 78-82. Epigraph: "Che debbo far, che poss'io far qui sola? | Chi me da ajuto, oime! chi me consola? | Ariosto."

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Although Palmyra, and Other Poems was dated 1806, it must have been published in November or December 1805, for the frontispiece is dated November 1805 and the volume was reviewed in the Literary Journal for December 1805 (5:1326-27). 2 Letter to Thomas L'Estrange, 3 July 1860, in The Works of Thomas Love Peacock , ed. H. F. B. Brett-Smith and C. E. Jones, 10 vols. (1924-34), 8:250—hereafter cited as Works . For Peacock's disappointment over the sale of Palmyra , see his letter to Edward Hookham, 18 August 1810, in Works , 8:188. 3 MS letter in the possession of John Storms, quoted in my "Peacock before Headlong Hall : A New Look at His Early Years," Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulletin , 36 (1985): 24. 4 For a detailed description of the Sadleir-Taylor MS, see Works , 7:460-462. Most of the transcripts are in an unidentified feminine hand, but five poems on pages 39-47 are copied in another hand that the Halliford editors take to be Peacock's. I find this ascription doubtful, partly on account of the appearance of the handwriting and partly on account of the uncharacteristic carelessness of the transcription. See, for example, the evidence of the copyist's insensitivity to the dialect of the comic Irishman in "Paddy's Lamentation," as revealed below in the collation of that poem with the text in the Berg MS. 5 Works , 7:462. 6 The Berg MS texts of four poems have been collated in Shelley and His Circle , ed. Kenneth Neill Cameron and Donald H. Reiman, 8 vols. to date (1961- ), 1:251-253, 277-284, 332-334, 374-377. The titles and dates of all twenty-eight poems have been listed in a note to my "Peacock before Headlong Hall ," pp. 15-16. Otherwise this interesting manuscript has been wholly ignored by Peacock scholars. It is here quoted by permission of the authorities of the Henry W. and Albert A.

Brett-Smith, Works , 1:xxviii, note. 11 See Shelley and His Circle , 1:314-317. 12 See Works , 7:523. 13 The only two known copies of The Monks of St. Mark are both in the New York Public Library: one in the Berg Collection and the other in the Pforzheimer Collection. The argument that the poem was printed at the same time as Palmyra is here developed more fully than was possible in my "Peacock before Headlong Hall ," p. 16. 14 A full record of the punctuation variants in the Berg MS would practically double the length of the collation, without making much difference in the way we read the poems. Even Peacock's exclamation points are used so liberally as to greatly weaken their force of emphasis. In general, the punctuation of the Berg MS is not only heavier but much more logical and consistent than that of the Sadleir-Taylor MS, many of whose worst defects have been supplied by the Halliford editors. Peacock's only unusual practice in the Berg MS is his frequent use of ellipsis points in place of, or in addition to, some other punctuation mark.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Last Gleanings From The Critic : Clemens, Whitman, Hardy, Thackeray, and Others by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the subtitles of The Critic , a literary periodical published in New York from 1881 until its merger with Putnam's Monthly Magazine in 1906, was A Weekly Review of Literature, Science, The Fine Arts, Music and The Drama . The magazine's wide purview naturally led it to pay special attention to contemporary literary figures; the resulting riches are now available for researchers who have the patience to glean. With this article I close my own series of investigations; 1 I meanwhile suggest to others with various interests that it will repay further study. In what follows I offer hitherto unrecorded materials by and about both American and English writers. Unless otherwise stated, the pieces quoted are not, to the best of my knowledge, in the standard editions of these authors. With volume 4 the periodical began a new series; my references cite the concurrent numbering according to the old series.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Samuel L. Clemens. The Critic of November 28, 1885 (vol. 7) had featured a celebration of Clemens's "Semi-Centennial" with tributes from Oliver Wendell Holmes (a poem), Frank R. Stockton, Charles Dudley Warner, and Joel Chandler Harris (letters). Clemens responded on December 5 (p. 271): My Dear Conspirators: —It was the pleasantest surprise I have ever had, and you have my best thanks. It reconciles me to being fifty years old; and it was for you to invent the miracle that could do that—I could never have invented one myself that could do it. May you live to be fifty yourselves, and find a fellow-benefactor in that hour of awful need. Sincerely yours, S. L. Clemens Hartford, Nov. 20, 1885 The following issue (Dec. 12, p. 283) quoted from an undated letter of Clemens on the same topic to an unnamed correspondent: Every mail brings me letters from people who seem glad I'm fifty years old. I do not see what I have done to have so many enemies. I have never congratulated a person for being fifty years of age. It is true I have shot at people in the dark when I have had something unusual against them, but I have drawn the line there. Another reference is of value for establishing the first printing and early text of a Clemens poem. Arthur L. Scott has reprinted Twain's verses "Contract With Mrs. T. K. Beecher, July 2, 1895," which he describes as "First printed in Munsey's Magazine , October, 1895." 2 But two months before that "The Lounger" column of The Critic (27 [Aug. 3, 1895], 79) quotes a "current paragraph" for the text of the verses and the circumstances that gave them rise. As not many readers will have ready access to The Critic and/or the verses themselves, I quote the whole entry: A current paragraph reports Mrs. Thomas K. Beecher as having concluded a conversation on immortality, in which Mark Twain had "taken the agnostic side," by asking him whether he would confess his error, if he should meet her in Heaven a million years hence. Mark promised that he would, and sealed the promise by writing appropriate stanzas on three stones found on the banks of the Chemung River, the three stones being fragments of what once was a single rock. The "contract" is dated Elmira, N. Y., 2 July 1895; and here are the terms of it:— "If you prove right and I prove wrong, A million years from now, In language plain and frank and strong, My error I'll avow. (To your dear mocking face)." "If I prove right, by God His grace, Full sorry I shall be, For in that solitude no trace There'll be of you and me, (Nor of our vanished race)." "A million years, O patient stone! You've waited for this message. Deliver it a million years— Survivor pays expressage." In line 5 of Scott's version, the word "mocking" has been changed to the possibly puzzling "waking." In line 11, "years" becomes "hence." Scott notes only that the poem was "Written on three leaves of stone"; the circumstances and details in The Critic make its origin more understandable. A final reference (31 [July 3, 1897], 8) reprints a letter of Clemens in response to a benefit fund that had been established for him. Mark Twain lost a fine opportunity to add to his reputation as a humorist in his letter declining the Hearld's fund for his benefit, after first having accepted it. His letter is one to make his many friends weep rather than smile. Here it is:— "To the Editor of the Herald:— "I made no revelation to my family of your generous undertaking in my behalf and for my relief from debt, and in that I was wrong. Now that they know all about the matter they contend I have no right to allow my friends to help me while my health is good and my ability to work remains, that it is not fair to my friends and not justifiable, and that it will be time enough to accept help when it shall be proven that I am no longer able to work. I am persuaded that they are right. While they are grateful for what you have done and for the kindly instinct which prompted you, it is urgent that the contributions be returned to the givers with their thanks and mine. I yield to their desire and forward their request and my indorsement of it to you. I was glad when you initiated that movement, for I was tired of the fact and worry of debt, but I recognize that it is not permissible for a man whose case is not hopeless to shift his burdens to other men's shoulders. "London, 19 June 1897. S. L. Clemens." In his biography Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain (1966) Justin Kaplan describes this project of the New York Herald (p. 349), but he does not mention Clemens's letter to the newspaper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Walt Whitman. The October 13, 1888, issue of The Critic (vol. 13) had published Edmund Gosse's provocative essay "Has America Produced a Poet?" Among those who responded in the November 24 number were John Greenleaf Whittier, John Burroughs, Julian Hawthorne, Julia Ward Howe, Charles Dudley Warner, and Walt Whitman, whom Gosse had met three years earlier, in 1885. (Gay Wilson Allen, who described the meeting in The Solitary Singer [1960; pp. 520-522], evidently did not know of Whitman's letter in response to the essay.) Whitman's letter (p. 521) was prefaced by editorial comment: Walt Whitman's views are, naturally, more radical than those of any other contributor to the discussion: Briefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct: 19—to answer the question whether I think any American poet not now living deserves a place among the thirteen "English inheritors of unassailed renown" (Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspere, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley and Keats,)—and which American poets would be truly worthy, &amp;c. Though to me the deep of the matter goes down, down beneath. I remember the London Times at the time, in opportune, profound and friendly articles on Bryant's and Longfellow's deaths, spoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and confusion on America (her poets and poetic students) "coming in possession of a great estate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn"; and the further contingency of "the English language ever having annexed to it a lot of first-class Poetry that would be American, not European"—proving then something precious over all, and beyond valuation. But perhaps that is venturing outside the question. Of the thirteen British immortals mentioned—after placing Shakspere on a sort of preëminence of fame not to be invaded yet—the names of Bryant, Emerson, Whittier and Longfellow (with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or other writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the baker's dozen of that glorious list.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oliver Wendell Holmes. Holmes is represented first by a letter of literary comments to Joseph Gilder, one of the editors of The Critic (21 [Sept. 10, 1892], 134): The following personal letter, written in answer to a question, is printed by permission of the writer:— Beverly Farms, Mass., Aug. 28th, 1892. My dear Mr. Gilder:— I have been interviewed already and got off as cheaply as I could, for it has become rather monotonous answering birthday questions—a little too much like 'What is your name? N. or M.', if I remember the Church Catechism correctly, as I used to see a stray copy of it now and then, in my boyhood, wondering what 'M. or N.' stood for. I have received two poems in advance, and my dear and honored friend Whittier, whose heart is a cornucopia of blessings for his fellow-creatures, has remembered me in the pages of The Atlantic , where we have found ourselves side by side for so many years. Long may the sands of his life keep running, for they come from the bed of Pactolus. I shall very probably have a few visitors to-morrow with whom I shall interchange kindly words, but I have really no news of myself which can interest. ------ Sept. 1. Here I was interrupted, and from that moment I have been in a perfect storm of letters, poems, flowers, fruits, gifts of various kinds; one of them a silver-framed chambered Nautilus from a Chicago lady—an exquisite piece of work, fit for a young prince's heir-loom rather than an old poet's. I have forgotten almost everything in the crowd and crush of these pleasant interruptions. But I must not forget to thank you for your kind remembrance, for which I am truly grateful, only regretting that I cannot reach all the kind and generous friends who have sent their cheering remembrances to one whose most notable virtue is that he is the survivor of so many of his betters. ------ Another interruption, and ah! how sad a one. A reporter calls at my door and tells me that George William Curtis died this morning. His death eclipses the cheerfulness of a great reading public. He has not left a sweeter nature or a fairer record behind him. The lovable quality of his bright intelligence showed in his features, in his voice, in every line he wrote. No American writer came so near taking the place of Washington Irving in the affections of his countrymen, no one has been more generally missed and lamented than he will be. Peace to his gentle memory! This is a day of mourning to all who love what is purest and best in letters and civilization. Believe me, dear Mr. Gilder, Faithfully yours, O. W. Holmes. Two years later a correspondent provided another letter (25 [Oct. 27, 1894], 273): To the Editors of The Critic:— Boston, Oct. 15, 1894. Since the following letter was written, I have enjoyed many a conversation with the genial Autocrat, but then I knew him only through his writings. It so aptly illustrates the uniform courtesy of the man as a man that I add it to The Critic's repertoire of tributes. The "magnifier" was a choice little magnifying-glass, set in solid silver, marked "O. W. H." W. C. W. "296 Beacon Street, July 9, 1872. "My Dear Sir:— "I am particularly obliged to you for returning my little magnifier with such promptness that I had not even time to miss it. I shall always value it more hereafter for having passed through the hands of a finder who proved not only honest but courteous. There may be a hundred or more honest men in Boston, but there are not many who would be so attentive. "I hope you blessed my instrument of research, as the Pope blesses a coin or a medal—at any rate you have conferred new value upon it. The bread that was cast upon the waters was to return "after many days," but my little estray cannot have been wandering from the pocket where it belongs many hours. "I truly wish I could lose something every day, if I were sure to have it so swiftly returned with a pleasant word for the owner to make him contented with himself and grateful to the friend who restores the lost possession. "Very truly and especially yours, "To Rev. W. C. Winslow, Boston. O. W. Holmes." I have found no reference to this little incident in the biographies of Holmes. Is it generally known that he used a "magnifier"?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Dean Howells. Among those writing letters on the occasion of the seventieth birthday of Leo Tolstoy were Edmund C. Stedman, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and Howells (his published in 33 [Oct. 1898], 288). Howells's letter, dated August 21, 1898, from York Harbor, Maine, is listed in the Bibliography of his works by William M. Gibson and George Arms (1948; p. 127) and was reprinted in part in the Bookman of New York in October 1898 (8: 107). It is not, however, one of the Selected Letters of the sixvolume Twayne edition. The passage included in the Bookman is the third of four paragraphs of the letter printed in The Critic , which I quote in its entirety. York Harbor, Maine, August 21, 1898. I am sorry that I shall not be able to join with his other friends in keeping the seventieth birthday of Leo Tolstoy. His writings and his life have meant more to me than any other man's; and if I could be with you I should try to express my deep sense of the import of his philosophy to such an age as this, and to a people who have been the latest, as I wish they might be the last, to make war. It seems to me that Tolstoy's greatest word is peace; and in this as in everything he appeals to the intellectual and spiritual reality within the official and social simulacrum which hides each of us from the others. It has been his mission to give men a bad conscience, to alarm them and distress them in the opinions and conventions in which they rested so comfortably. He repeats to us the divinely simple truth which the good and wise have known from the beginning, in terms which the most modern intelligence cannot refuse as trite. He arrives at a moment of civilization when no one any longer contends that the evils which war sums up in itself are justifiable apart from it, and he asks us to refrain from them by refraining from war, which makes imperative things essentially and immutably wrong. Tolstoy's literature, his matchless art, his fiction, which makes all other appear so feeble and false, is merely the flower of his love of men, his desire to be true to them. All that he has written, so far as I know it, is of one effect with all that he has been since he came to his moral consciousness. I cannot separate his aesthetics from his ethics, for he has himself known no difference in them. But it seems to me that in his fiction he works more instinctively and vitally, and I believe that in this he will work longest. As a teacher he has put in contemporaneous terms the wisdom which has always been in the world for the conduct of men; but as an artist he has divined things concerning their nature and character in mystical heights and depths unreached before, and has portrayed life with an unexampled truth and fullness. Such a man was sure to come when he was needed most; and in order that he should perform his office to the generation to which he was sent it was not necessary that his own life should be perfect, or his whole doctrine unerring. One perfect life and one unerring doctrine we had already, and it is praise enough for Tolstoy to say that he teaches these with all his heart and all his mind; and however he falters or wanders, he worships them by a constant endeavor for their goodness and beauty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Fenimore Cooper. In James Fenimore Cooper (1949), James Grossman devoted some four pages to the relationship of Cooper and Edward ("Ned") Meyers (pp. 183-186). A letter from Cooper in The Critic (37 [Sept. 1900], 200) amplifies that account. Mr. E. R. Mason, of Binghamton, N.Y., has kindly placed the following letter at our disposal: Hall, Cooperstown, Jan. 12, 1850. Dear Sir: During the last session, a law granting a pension to Edward Myers. passed to Hou. Rep., but was not taken up in the Senate. Myers was the old seaman whose life and services I have recorded in "Ned Myers." I feel quite confident of the justice of his claims, having the facts from eye-witnesses, as well as from his commander, the late Comm. Chauncey. There is no doubt that his energy, coolness, and skill were the principal means of saving some ten or twelve lives, the night he received the hurt for which the pension is asked. Alas! Poor Myers can now never be benefited by the grant. He died of dropsy a few weeks since, leaving a widow and several children. The arrears of this pension is all he had to bequeath. He made a will leaving everything to his wife during her life, and then to the children. I do not know whether the law will have to be taken up again in the House, but I suppose a claim once looked into, and in-so-much granted, will be regarded as sacred. May I ask your good offices in this matter. It is for a widow and orphans that the grant will now be made. It might interest them were this letter shown to Messrs. Calhoun, Cass, Seward, Cooper, and others of the Senate. I think I can safely say that the claimant well deserved all his family will get, and more too. I remain very truly Yours, J. Fenimore Cooper. D.S. Dickinson, Esquire, U. S. Senate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Russell Lowell to Edgar Allen Poe. According to M. A. DeWolfe Howe, James Russell Lowell wrote to George Woodberry on March 12, 1884, that "[I saw Poe only once] and that must have been, I think, in 1843 when I was in New York sitting to Page for my portrait." 3 Whatever the date of the meeting, it is known that in 1843 Lowell wrote at least four letters on various literary matters to Poe. A letter of September 27, 1844, was printed in Richard Henry Stoddard's Recollections Personal and Literary , ed. Ripley Hitchcock (1903; pp. 101-102). The Critic (42 [April 1903], 319) prints a facsimile of this letter, revealing a phrase not present in Stoddard's text. Referring to his biography of Poe that he will send Poe, Lowell says, "It is not half so good as it ought to be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Thomas Hardy. In its issue of July 9, 1892, The Critic had begun its review of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by noting that the American edition lacked Hardy's preface (pp. 13-14). Hardy responded with a letter in the issue of September 10, 1892 (21: 134): Max Gate, Dorchester, Aug. 26th, 1892. To the Editors of The Critic:— A complaint has reached me from your pages to the effect that even in the revised and enlarged American edition of "Tess of the D'Urbervilles' I have thought fit to suppress the explanatory preface which appears in all the English editions. I find it to be quite true that the preface is omitted; but you will perhaps allow me to assure your readers that such omission was not intentional on my part, but arose from circumstances of publication over which I had no control at the time. I am now taking measures to attach to the American edition both the original preface and a new preface which is in preparation for the fifth English edition. I may add in this connection that the necessity for (at least) simultaneous publication in America of English books, to secure copyright, renders it almost impossible that the latest addenda of an author should be incorporated in the foreign imprint. Could even a fortnight's grace be allowed, final touches, given just before going to press on this side, would not be excluded from American copies as they now are in so many cases. Yours faithfully, Thomas Hardy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Carlyle on Ralph Waldo Emerson. The June 13, 1891, number of The Critic (18: 318) conveys Carlyle's views on the "rural hermitship" that some followers of Emerson's ideas had adopted. —In a recent London sale was a letter from Carlyle on a lecture by Emerson that had been sent him, in which he says:— Thanks for your gift of Emerson's lecture. Mr. Ballantyne had already sent me two copies; that was my first sight of the performance. It is an excellent discourse, greatly wanted on both sides of the Atlantic, and cannot be too widely circulated. Probably you are not aware that in New England a certain set of persons, grounding themselves on these ideas of Emerson's, are already about renouncing this miserable humbug of a world altogether, and retiring into the rural wilderness, to live there exclusively upon vegetables raised by their own digging. Three hours' daily work they say will produce a man sufficient vegetables, and he can live there according to his own mind, leaving the world to live according to its. An American was here lately, as an express missionary of all that, working for recruits, for proselytes; naturally finding none. I was obliged to express my total, deep, irreclaimable dissent from the whole vegetable concern, not without great offense to the missionary, and that, perhaps, is the reason why he sent me no American copy of this lecture. Emerson does not yet go into vegetables, into rural hermitship; and we hope never will. Thomas Ballantyne (whose name does not appear in the index of the Duke University edition of Carlyle's letters) was a friend of Carlyle's who wrote a memoir of him and edited some of his writings. Emersonians may be able to suggest a date for Carlyle's letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Makepeace Thackeray. On September 17, 1892, The Critic (21: 150) reprinted a letter from Anne Ritchie's "Chapters from Some Unwritten Memoirs, VIII," MacMillan's Magazine , 66 (Sept. 1892), 349-349, in which Thackeray praised Carlyle's work. Thackeray was a great admirer of Carlyle. In a letter to his mother, written in 1839, he says:—"I wish you could get Carlyle's miscellaneous criticisms. I have read a little in the book. A nobler one does not live in our language, I am sure, and one that will have such an effect on our ways of thought and prejudices. Criticism has been a party matter with us till now, and literature is a poor political lacquey. Please God we shall begin, ere long, to love art for art's sake. It is Carlyle who has worked more than any other to give it its independence." A month later (21 [Oct. 15, 1892], 212) "The Lounger" column reported that "In a letter to Dr. Henry Van Dyke some time in 1889 he [Thackeray] said:—'I think it wisest in a man to do his work in the world as quickly and as well as he can, without much heeding the praise and dispraise.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles Reade. In his column titled "Boston Letter," the miscellaneous writer William Henry Rideing quoted some letters of Reade (12 [Feb. 11, 1888], 68). Reade had gone to Cannes in early September 1883 and returned to London late in February, 1884, where he died on Good Friday, April 11. Rideing thought that presentation of the letters was timely because they mention a posthumous work on "Biblical Character" announced for publication in London. 'The subject is old,' he writes in one letter, The subject is old, but it is as good as new and better; because up to this date the treatment of such subjects by French, German and English writers has been all a mistake and a truly wonderful one. I cannot in the compass of a single letter explain the many vital blunders in their treatment. I must confine myself to saying that it is so; and that everybody will see it when my manuscripts are printed. I have already written a short preliminary discourse, and described two Bible characters who pass for small Bible characters only because the divines who have handled them have literally no insight into character whatever. In the same letter he complains of the Canadian publishers. The Canadian publishers are a thorn in the side of American publishers: they do you harm in all manner of ways; they are ungrateful knaves. . . . In spite of bronchitis and some strange disorder in the intestines, I am fulfilling an engagement to write a serial story in Harper's Weekly and I hope to publish it in a month, but I do not think I shall ever again undertake to write a story of that length. After all, condensation is a fine thing, and perhaps a story long enough to excite an interest and paint characters vividly, a story in which there is no conversation but only dialogue which rapidly advances the progress of the action, is more likely to be immortal than those more expanded themes which betray us nto diffuseness. In another letter he maintained the impossibility of writing a good story without making love the foundation of it. The truth is that Fiction is a more severe mistress than people think. An imaginative writer often begins his career with subjects independent of sexual love, but his readers, and especially his female readers, soon show him that they won't stand it, and so they drag him out of the by-paths of invention and force him into the turnpike road, until at last their habit becomes his, and I suppose his mind accepts the groove. These letters were written from Cannes, and each complained of his sufferings. A week or two after the date of the last he returned to London and died in the little house at Shepherd's Bush, which he took after leaving 'Naboth's Vineyard' in Knights-bridge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arthur Conan Doyle. In The Critic of December 21, 1893, Conan Doyle wrote asking a favor (23: 362): I have seen reviews in American papers of a collection of stories under my name, entitled 'My Friend the Murderer.' Would you have the goodness to allow me to state in your columns that the book is published without any sanction of mine, and that the tales in it were written many years ago, and were meant to have the ephemeral life they deserve? It is a matter of very little interest to anyone else no doubt, but it is slightly annoying to an author when work which he has deliberately repressed is resuscitated against his wish. Reform Club, London, 13 Nov. 1893. The publishers of My Friend the Murderer wrote to The Critic to the effect that they, Lovell &amp; Co., had bought the stories from "an agent" of Conan Doyle's named "Mr. Hogg" for "twenty-five pounds" (Dec. 23, 1893). Conan Doyle's answer, dated January 7, 1894, from Davos Platz, states in part, "I have no doubt that Messrs. Lovell &amp; Co. have as much to complain of as I, but I would suggest to them that an agent should be asked to furnish some credentials. I have never employed any agent of that name, and my first intimation of the appearance of the book was a review in an American journal" (24 [Jan. 27, 1894], 65). I have not found an account of this contretemps in the literature on Conan Doyle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edmund Gosse on John Keats. On June 9, 1894, The Critic (24: 388) reprinted a letter from Edmund Gosse to the Times of London, where it had appeared on May 24. To the Editor of The Times:— Sir, —As the centenary of the birth of John Keats approaches, it will doubtless be of importance to a wide circle of lovers of English poetry to be informed of any steps which it may be intended to take in the direction of honoring so beloved a memory. . . . The American Committee, which has been engaged for some five years past in preparing for an English memorial of Keats, has done me the honor to communicate to me its intentions, and has asked me to make them known in this country. The movement is due to the piety of Mr. F. Holland Day of Norwood, Massachusetts, who is a great Keats enthusiast. As early as 1889, Mr. Day began to suggest to certain men-of-letters and artists in America that a monument to the poet should be presented by the United States to England. He consulted Mr. Lowell in particular, and received the warmest encouragement from him. There is no doubt, indeed, that, if the life of Mr. Lowell had been prolonged, he would to-day be found at the head of this generous movement. Among those, however, who, on the failure of Mr. Lowell's health, continued to urge forward the execution of the scheme, were Prof. Charles Eliot Norton, Mr. T. B. Aldrich, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, the late Dr. T. W. Parsons, and, indeed, most of those who are now prominent in American poetical literature. . . . Mr. Day has arrived in this country with a marble bust of Keats, which, through the kindness of the vicar, the Rev. Mr. Burnaby, will shortly be unveiled in the parish church at Hampstead. It now merely awaits the carrying out of the accepted design for a bracket, upon which the advice of Mr. E. Onslow Ford, A.R.A., was desired. Lovers of Keats—and this is but a synonym for lovers of poetry—will presently receive a formal announcement of the date when the little ceremony of presenting and accepting the bust will be performed at Hampstead. So far I obey the duty which has been laid upon me by our American friends. Will you permit me to add one word for ourselves? Surely, while we accept this gracious gift from our Transatlantic kinsfolk, we shall not be able to do so without some sense of shame at our own negligence in rites so appropriate and seemly. How long are we to be contented to accept from others monuments to those men of genius who are, after all, not theirs, but ours? In a few months a hundred years will have passed since the birth of one of the most illustrious and original of the long line of English poets, yet if there is any scheme on foot for the celebration of that event by Englishmen on English soil, I have not been fortunate enough to hear of it. There is no other country in the world that could have produced a Keats a hundred years ago, and yet could still point out no public monument to his memory. It is fortunate that America, at least, is sensitive about those national glories to which we seem perfectly indifferent. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, Edmund Gosse. 29, Delamere-terrace, London, W., May 24. In her biography Edmund Gosse, A Literary Landscape, 1849-1928 (1984) Ann Thwaite notes that Gosse gave an admired oration at the "unveiling of the Keats Memorial at Hampstead, a splendid present from his American admirers" (p. 352). She does not mention Gosse's letter or his regret that the English themselves could not erect a monument to one of their great poets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">H. G. Wells on George Bernard Shaw. After the Academy of London had published a list of "Forty Immortals of Contemporary English Literature," the editors of The Critic reprinted letters of reaction. On November 27, 1897, they wrote (31: 326): "Mr. H. G. Wells says, among other things:— 'There is a lot of overdone Heine about George Bernard Shaw; but eliminate that, and there is a sufficient literary residue to put beside or a little above, Bryce or Trevelyan." There is little need for an obvious conclusion, but I shall state it anyway: The Critic has served me well and will reward other students who take the time to pore over its pages.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Shaw's Forgotten Lecture (And Other Matters Shavian) by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the course of my grubbing in periodicals I have come upon some unrecorded items of interest to students of the life and writings of Bernard Shaw. The Cambridge Review, a weekly review of university life and thought , reported in the October 17, 1907, number that "Mr. G. B. Shaw will lecture under the auspices of the Cambridge University Fabian Society on 'Socialism and the University Man' on October 24th. There will be a limited number of tickets for which application should be made to E. H. Dalton, King's College." The report of the lecture and the letters that followed have been overlooked by Shaw's biographers. The lecture was briefly reported in the Cambridge Review for October 31 with an anecdote involving a postcard written by Shaw. Mr Bernard Shaw gave us a most exhilarating lecture in the Alexandra Rooms on the University Man and Socialism. Those who study our Correspondence columns will see that his economics did not convince every member of his audience. . . . The Chairman, Mr Wedd of King's College, introduced Mr Shaw by relating a history which should not be buried in the obscurity of lapsing time. He told the story of Mr Shaw's first visit to lecture in Cambridge, and of the influence his fiery eloquence had upon a little old Professor in the audience, who thought much and long on Mr Shaw's ideals, but was not sure of his 'Ethical Basis.' The little old Professor was afterwards better known as Bishop Westcott: and Mr Wedd delighted his audience by telling them of the post-card which Mr Shaw sent at the Chairman's request to allay Professor Westcott's doubts. It was delightfully simple—we hope a sancta simplicitas which will condone its reproduction here—'You know the old boy better than I do: tell him my E. B. is the same as his.' The anecdote about the postcard goes back to Shaw's 1888 visit to Cambridge where he spoke on "Socialism: Its Growth and Necessity." Nathaniel Wedd, Fellow of King's College and secretary of the Cambridge Fabian Society, had arranged for that visit. A different version of the postcard was recorded by G. Lowes Dickinson; here Shaw's answer to Professor Westcott, later Bishop of Durham, was, "Ask the old boy what his is, and tell him mine's the same." 1 The same number of the Cambridge Review printed a letter by Charles R. Webster of King's College, which throws a little more light on the content of the lecture. Webster reported that Shaw "denied that capital could be made to leave this country by onerous taxation of the rich, although he admitted that 'saved income' (the only source of capital) can very readily and easily leave the country." Webster's letter prompted two others, one by Frederic Keeling of Trinity College and one by Dudley Ward of St. John's College, both in the November 7 number. Keeling disagreed with Webster and maintained that the "advance of Socialism" would not "drain capital out of the country." Ward tried to mediate between Webster and Shaw: Taking Mr Shaw's statement that at present capital can 'very readily and easily leave the country' as intended, also the future, he triumphantly suggests that Mr Shaw has given away his case. It was rather unfair, however, to overlook the speaker's proposal for meeting this difficulty by an income tax graduated to the disadvantage of incomes derived from foreign investments. These letters give some idea of the tenor of Shaw's lecture. Webster replied to both Keeling and Ward the following week, writing that Shaw "wished the middle classes to join the labour classes in a systematic attempt to obtain a large portion of the incomes of the rich by means of taxation. He distinctly maintained that, once the control of the taxing power was obtained, there was nothing to prevent this. But he entirely disregarded the effect of such taxation on the supply of capital." All of which culminated in Shaw's reply to Webster in the November 28 number of the periodical. This letter has also been overlooked. I quote it in its entirety. Mr Charles R. Webster has made a curious mistake. He thinks he has put a difficulty to me. It is I who have put a difficulty to him; and he has not yet got over it. Far from 'minimising the importance of the fact that capital can leave the country,' I point out that capital can and does leave the country at present. All the capital I have myself invested is invested abroad, with the exception of certain sums which I have invested in England in concerns which present the special attraction of having ventured on what may be described as limited socialism. What has Mr Webster to say to this? His position is founded on the assumption that a system which drives capital out of the country is thereby condemned. Therefore the existing system is out of court as far as he is concerned. I have been kind enough to try to save him from the consequences of his own argument by suggesting that even within the limits of the present system, emigration of capital could be discouraged by a special tax on imported dividends. He replies in despair that 'the easy way in which such a tax could be evaded makes it a practical impossibility.' This shews that Mr Webster has no practical experience of foreign investments. They are taxed almost automatically: the revenue suffers much less from evasions in their case than in that of income made at home. However, if Mr Webster will not have it so, his difficulty is all the greater. Mr Webster quotes Professor Marshall as saying 'In recent years we have suffered much from schemes which claim to be practical, and yet are based on no thorough study of economic realities.' I entirely agree with Prof. Marshall. There is nothing more appalling in English public life than the way in which politicians of all parties appeal to popular ignorance for permission to lay hands on our industrial system without the most elementary knowledge of economics. Fortunately, that is a reproach which neither Professor Marshall nor any other expert is likely to level at the Fabian Society. Mr Webster, by ascribing such a blunder to Professor Marshall, is committing felo de se; and I leave it to King's College to bury him with the ceremonies appropriate to the manner of his decease. Yours truly, G. Bernard Shaw. 10, Adelphi Terrace, London, W.C. 23rd November, 1907. All this may be added to Michael Holroyd's account of Shaw and Fabianism in Volume II, 1898-1918, The Pursuit of Power of his Bernard Shaw (1989). The November 11, 1916, number of The Cambridge Magazine , a periodical which boasted the "Largest Circulation of any University Weekly in Great Britain," contained the statement, "We imagine that our readers will be interested to see the following extracts from some of the letters which the Editor has received during the past few weeks." Extracts from five letters are quoted, the writers of the letters being, in order, Thomas Hardy (two sentences), William Archer (one sentence), Bernard Shaw (which I quote below), John Masefield (two sentences), and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (two paragraphs). All the letters praise the periodical, Hardy admitting "a liking for the lighter paragraphs," Archer urging wide reading of the Foreign Press section, and Masefield terming it "an excellent piece of work." Quiller-Couch, Professor of English at Cambridge University, commenting on the course of the war, also praised the Foreign Press section. Shaw also sided with Archer and Quiller-Couch: "The Cambridge Magazine is, as far as I know, the only paper which attempts to do for the public what has to be done every morning by our official departments; that is, supply a conspectus of the foreign press. The ordinary papers supply what they call Sidelights, by which they mean One Side Lights, which are much more dangerous than no lights at all when driving between the devil and the deep sea. The consequence is that there has been, throughout the war, a dangerous discrepancy between the instructed official and executive opinion and public opinion. Ministers are compelled to talk to the public according to its ignorance instead of according to their own knowledge; and thus the gulf between them is widened. Some day the Government will be forced by military necessity to propose some step for which the nation is unprepared and against which it is violently prejudiced. The Government will be overborne by public opinion; and the military authorities will be compelled, not for the first time, to ignore the Government and to coerce the nation. The only available precaution against such a schism at present is a conscientious study of the Cambridge Magazine ." In November 1914, when his Common Sense About the War appeared, Shaw's public reputation was at its nadir, so it seems strange that in November 1916 a journal would value a statement of praise from him. Perhaps by then (after the Battle of the Somme) people were becoming more aware of the truth of Shaw's objections to the Great War. 2 I have come upon a few pieces that have escaped the efforts of J. P. Wearing, editor of G. B. Shaw. An Annotated Bibliography of Writings About Him. Volume I: 1871-1930 (1986). Two are from The English Review , the periodical started by Ford Madox Ford; the first appears in the section titled "The Month" in an anonymous discussion of realism in the drama, particularly about Shaw and J. M. Barrie. I quote the passages pertinent to Shaw: It is certain that neither Mr. Barrie nor Mr. Shaw come with any frequency at all near to the life we live to-day. Regarded philosophically each of Mr. Shaw's plays resolves itself into a variety entertainment in which character after character does his brilliant verbal "turn" and then retires into the background. . . . Subtlety of speech is impossible upon the stage, for you cannot turn back the leaf to read the speech before the last, and whilst you are reflecting upon the hidden meaning of one speech you will miss the significance of three more. . . . For subtlety Mr. Shaw substitutes half-truths in startling aspects. How Mr. Shaw would come off if it were considered bad taste to laugh in theatres, so that speech after speech was uttered without the break and the pause for the inevitable Shavian laughter, we hardly dare to speculate. . . . His speakers overspeak, his actors overact, and we are delighted. But a touch of realism will disturb our delight. * * * But both Mr. Shaw, who gives us real speeches producing an effective unreality, and Mr. Barrie, who gives us speeches in one evening more sentimental than any collection of real characters could utter in the course of a year—who convinces us in fact by a very unreal means—both Mr. Shaw and Mr. Barrie do render some service to the Republic. The one quickens our emotions, the other our thoughts. And it is possible that the drama cannot do more than this, for are not to think and to feel the converse of necessary qualities of a proper man? (1 [Jan. 1909]: 321—322) An essay titled "The Critical Attitude" with the sub-title "English Literature of To-day" begins with a long paragraph on Shaw, Granville Barker, and John Galsworthy. Of non-commercial English Dramatists three names at least are worthy of consideration. They are those of Mr. Granville Barker, Mr. John Galsworthy and Mr. Bernard Shaw. . . . They attempt to present us with really human figures caught in the toils of vicissitudes really human, acting as human beings really would do in a world such as these Dramatists, each after his kind, may chance to see it. This is most particularly true of Mr. Granville Barker and least so of Mr. Bernard Shaw. The attraction of Mr. Shaw is that of unreasonable brilliancy. The sallies of his characters hold our attentions but they do not engage our sympathies. We are delighted with his figures whilst they talk, but all the while we are subconsciously aware that we do not believe that any human beings so ready with their tongues ever existed. The consequence is that Mr. Shaw's plays—and it is with this purpose that he sets out to write—may very well awaken thought. But it is as to the ideas expressed by his characters rather than as to their human and personal problems that we are set thinking. . . . And just because ideas as to ideas are relatively valueless in comparison with the ideas aroused by human problems, so the effect of Mr. Shaw's work is comparatively transitory. Not one of his plays will leave as much mark upon the emotions as, let us say, The Playboy of the Western World , by Mr. Synge, now so untimely dead. (3 [Nov. 1909]: 655-666) Although Wearing's bibliography does list thirteen pieces from The English Review , these two items may have been deemed inappropriate for inclusion because they are only parts of pieces not wholly devoted to Shaw. Two other pieces appeared in The Egoist , for which there is no listing in Wearing's "Index of Periodicals and Newspapers." The first was a facetious essay by Huntly Carter, "The Re-Incarnation of Mr. Bernard Shaw," in the September 1, 1914, number of the periodical (1: 337-338). Carter had devoted a few pages (Wearing, p. 145, no. 1196) to Shaw in his The New Spirit in Drama and Art (1913) and was to expand on his remarks in The New Spirit in the European Theatre 1914-1924 . . . (1925; Wearing, p. 307, no. 2518). Carter's essay was prompted by a recently published Supplement "with that Shaw-ridden journal, 'The New Statesman', on the subject of the 'ModernTheatre'." He deals first with Shaw himself. This theatrical blue-book not only starts off with Mr. George Bernard Shaw, but it reeks of him. One is simply bewildered by his re-incarnations. There are Bernard Roger Fry, G. B. Desmond MacCarthy, George Bernard Ashley Dukes, G. Bernard William Archer, George Granville Barker Shaw, and so on, and so on, and so on, till one staggers with the shrieks of the Shavian spooks. The real Shaw is the only one worth a moment's notice. Having nothing better to feed on, he appears feeding on the Cinema as the nearest he can get to the sublime in the theatre. . . . Take this statement for instance:—"Now, the cinema tells its story to the illiterate as well as to the literate; and it keeps its victim (if you like to call him so) not only awake but fascinated as if by a serpent's eye. And that is why the cinema is going to produce effects that all the cheap books in the world could never produce" (nor all the cheap Shaw plays). If this means anything, it means that the cinema has revealed to Mr. Shaw its amazing aesthetic-dramatic possibilities. . . . —Whether the effect of the cinema noticed by Mr. Shaw, does not conclusively prove that Mr. Shaw and his disciples have led the drama off the right line of development? Whether, therefore, the cinema is not likely to provoke to revolt the indestructible dramatic instincts of mankind? And whether, in drawing attention to the cinema and its dramatic possibilities Mr. Shaw is not in danger of confirming a suspicion which says that Mr. Shaw has a reputation as a playwright but no one supposes that he wishes it to be remembered. But these questions do not occur to Mr. Shaw. He is far too busy evolving Shaw the chastiser with scorpions from the picture show. He then dispatches Mr. Roger Fry-Shaw, Mr. Desmond MacCarthy-Shaw, Mr. Granville Barker-Shaw, Mr. Ashley Dukes-Shaw and Professor William Archer-Shaw, with nary a kind word for any of them. Mr. Dukes-Shaw, he writes, "is not one of the Supreme Intelligences. He is a Shavian, and a very little and ugly one." I quote only the first sentence of Carter's concluding paragraph: "Considered as a whole the Supplement has an air of ephemeralism, petrification and putrefaction." He may be alluding to Shaw's playlet, Passion, Poison, and Petrifaction, or The Fatal Gazogene (1905). In the 1913 New Spirit in Drama and Art , Carter wrote, "Ibsen, for example, has never recovered from Mr. Bernard Shaw's victimisation of him. Together with Shakespeare, he was butchered to make a Fabian holiday" (p. 36). He had no sudden volte face in the Egoist essay: "It was William Archer who discovered the literary Ibsen; Bernard Shaw, the economic Ibsen; between them they murdered the spiritual Ibsen." And by 1925 he was still belaboring Shaw, although five years later he asked Shaw's opinion on the cinema as an art form. Shaw answered on January 1, 1930, quite politely. He wrote that "Art for art's sake is rather like fox hunting or skating, which have no sense except as ways of procuring food or moving from place to place, but are continued for fun by people who don't eat foxes and also, after hours of skating, take off their skates at the spot where they put them on, without having travelled in the meantime further than the opposite side of the pond." He concluded, "In short, I don't quite see why you should boggle at the description of the cinema as an art form." 3 The second piece on Shaw in The Egoist was by M. Montagu-Nathan, better known as Montagu Montagu Nathan, a musicologist who wrote much on Russian Music. "'Shaw—' (From the Epilogue, Fanny's First Play )" appeared in the August 1916 number (3: 121-122). The essay deserves to be read in its entirety, but I shall only quote parts. For many many years George Bernard Shaw has been preaching Christianity, but—perhaps because until lately the name God has not occurred in his discourse—even his parishioners appear to have been unaware of his theme. . . . First came "A Little Gospel of Redemption for a Little Theatre." Its hero, a duke's brother, expiates his sin, committed when a master, by serving a parvenu. There was an odd thing about Fanny's First Play , namely, that its author neglected to demonstrate what should be the attitude of the Superman towards the slapper of his cheek. . . . It seemed plain, in short, that Shaw had not yet finished with Christianity. And when Androcles came, it was proven. . . . In Androcles there is none of the destructive satire of France's Procurator of Judœa , but its fault lies in that Shaw is not content with his long-pursued constructive scheme of making people laugh at themselves, and thus build up a happiness that none can destroy, but descends with his dancing lion to court the guffaws of the gallery. In his long Preface on The Prospects of Christianity his lion dances again. At times Shaw is deliciously flippant. . . . At others, both in the play and in the preface, he risks the easily incurred displeasure of the snippet-readers who have never inquired what he is talking about but know him only by these detached things he happens to have said. . . . Only the Philistine will object to his having called Christ an artist, and only the fanatic will feel hurt by the implication that the believer is drunk and the sceptic sober, while the fool alone—accompanied possibly by the conscientious objector—will take exception to the mild Nietzscheism in his exposition of the Divine character. This was inevitable in a man accustomed to examine every question, even those affecting himself, from all points of view. Therein lies Britain's debt to Shaw. He has attempted to teach the beefy Broadbent to think impersonally. . . . In Androcles he sets out to show us that Christ never meant us to receive a blow on the second cheek, but to disarm our adversary either by displaying an exquisite sense of humour or, like Dostoieffsky's immortal Mwishkin, a baffling ingenuousness. But in the play this, and almost every point, is so prepared, so coquetted with that it is gathered by the audience without the shock that alone can compel the mind to retain its essential truth. So it is with Pygmalion . It has not been given to every one to write, talk and debate convincingly about art and pugilism, drama and medicine, music and sociology, to consort, as he once did, with the artistic aristocracy of the future, to speak in plays both like "the man of the world" and like him "of the world to come," and who else in Britain perceived that the accent of "educated people" has so much in common with Cockney that a flower-girl may, with a little training in manners, represent a duchess, so long as the manners are remembered? All this too, was foretold when, in the Dramatic Essays, he rebuked Irving for his ridiculous vowels. There is one idea absent from the Preface to Pygmalion that would perhaps have brought home the importance of the study of phonetics . . . but he does not say in what the importance of phonetics lies. And to the present writer it seems to lie in that, once versed and practised, one can tell not where a parson was born, but the particular parish in Heaven he wishes to occupy, by the way he pronounces the name of the Deity. What a tale of Gards, Guds, Gords, Higgins could have made! He would have found one for each of the jarring sects. Why a specialist in Russian music should have written on Shaw's plays remains a mystery. Ivor Brown, the foremost English dramatic critic for more than thirty years, wrote much on Shaw. One minor piece, tangentially about Shaw, has been overlooked and should be added to the literature on Shaw. The short piece, "Shaw's First Manager," was published in the New Statesman and Nation , July 6, 1935 (N.S. 10, no. 228, 12-13). The manager was J. T. Grein, of whom Brown wrote, after giving biographical information about him, that if he "had done nothing more for the English century than open its doors to G—B—S, he deserved of our country, which he made his by adoption, the recognition which foreign governments delighted to give him." A major oversight is the failure of bibliographers to remark W. J. Turner's long article "G.B.S. as Music Critic" in the August 6, 1932, New Statesman and Nation (N.S. 4, no. 76, 154-156). Turner is described in the DNB as poet, musical critic, journalist, and playwright, and he knew whereof he wrote. The article is too long to quote in its entirety. Turner is reviewing the three volumes of "musical criticism contributed to the World week by week during the years 1890-94" and writes in his second paragraph, Mr. Shaw was the best and most brilliant professional journalist London had known since the days of Hazlitt and De Quincey, and if we of the present generation are apt to look askance at Mr. Shaw and even to detest what seems to us a superficial omniscience, we have only to dip once more into his dramatic criticisms or to read these three volumes of his musical criticisms to discover again what a great intellectual force he was and what a large part he has played in the development of the mental activity of this country. A good deal of the rest of the article is given over to quotation of Shaw's criticism, with Turner's comments. He quotes Shaw on his attitude as a critic, on Wagner and on Gustav Mahler as conductor of Wagner, on Chopin and George Sand, on Brahms and Beethoven, and on Verdi. Of this last Turner notes, "Even more astonishing [than his criticism of Brahms] is his perception of the greatness of Verdi, not only the Verdi of Otello and Falstaff , but of the early Verdi," and then he quotes Shaw on Verdi's Ernani . Turner briefly notes Shaw's appreciation of Yvette Guilbert, Richter, Mott, and Joachim and his wrong-headed view of Schubert. And he concludes: "Sometimes reading his musical criticism I wonder what had happened to Mr. Shaw. He has grown old, but has not grown old like Verdi." Wyndham Lewis, in his short-lived periodical The Enemy, A Review of Art and Literature (1927-29), appended some "Notes" to the third and last volume, dated First Quarter, 1929. The first of the six notes bears the title "My disciple, Mr. Bernard Shaw" and was prompted, as will be seen, by an article in Time and Tide for November 16, 1928. I quote in part. At the time of Mr. Bernard Shaw's letter in favour of Fascism, I thought from extracts that found their way into the Press, or comments, that I would henceforth have to reckon with a new disciple. . . . "It is a convention to assume that there is nothing people like more than political liberty. As a matter of fact there is nothing they dread more. Under the feeble and apologetic tyranny of Dublin Castle we Irish were forced to endure a considerable degree of compulsory freedom. The moment we got rid of that tyranny we rushed to enslave ourselves. We gave our police power to seize any man's property and to put upon him the onus of proving that it belonged to him. We declared that as prison would not deter Irishmen from evil-doing they must be savagely flogged; and when the evil-doers were flogged they were imprisoned for long periods lest the flogging should provoke them to commit fresh crimes." . . . What concerns me of course is this: the Art of Being Ruled , as interpreted by Mr. Shaw, will probably find itself involved with a motley of doctrines. . . . One thing I am sure about, however: that is that my new disciple will always be upon the winning side, or sides (and so to some extent he will be a security for my opinions): also that he will never commit any gaffe or make any scandal (so through him my teaching will never get into trouble but remain eminently respectable as far as he is concerned). With him my doctrine is safe and that is something. But still I am doubtful whether I should repudiate him, or, on the other hand, allow him silently to take his place in proximity to a book that contradicts so flatly what he has taught himself all his life. The Art of Being Ruled is by Lewis; in it he devotes some four pages (55-58) to adverse criticism of St. Joan and Back to Methuselah . He seems not to have had anything further to say about Shaw. A long, anonymous (editorial?) review of Shaw's Too True to be Good, Village Wooing , and On the Rocks was the second offering in the New Statesman and Nation for February 24, 1934 (N.S. 7: 250-257). It, too, has gone unremarked despite its title, "Fascism and Mr. Shaw." The review is made up of four long paragraphs; I quote part of the second, the most pertinent for analysis of Shaw's views. In the play On the Rocks Mr. Shaw paints a picture of the existing political situation: a national Government headed by a Prime Minister attractive and likable, a master of phrases once spell-binding but now void of meaning, eternally busy with no time to think; a Cabinet of party men thinking in terms of general elections, attempting to ignore the surging discontent of the masses who are increasingly contemptuous of Parliament, party politics and "old men"; a head of the police professionally concerned with keeping order by whatever means come to hand; Labour leaders who know that something must be done, but who are frightened of new ideas; Communists whose doctrines are as dogmatically held as they are poorly adapted to existing circumstances. Mr. Shaw makes fun of the lot. When the Prime Minister, after a fortnight's thinking over the works of Karl Marx, returns with a new energy, the policy he launches is a very un-Marxian hotch-potch which, it is suggested, might prove attractive to the multitude if put forward by a leader who was young and energetic and able to combine an armed nationalism with an authoritarian determination to put everything to rights without any nonsense about liberty. No wonder that Mr. Shaw is accused of advertising Fascism. The joke is that when he gets down to thinking seriously about the problem raised in his play, the result is a Preface which completely smashes the Fascist case. . . . And for the first time he seriously argues the problem of liberty, reaching the conclusion that economics must be the business of experts, everybody doing his share of work—he says we must all be "slaves" in our working hours—while leisure should be completely free, and, finally, the right to criticise sacrosanct. The reviewer added that "It is a good thing that Mr. Shaw has at length realized his own importance. He has been muddle-headed enough in the past to praise Mussolini's oppression of personal freedom, though it was always enough that if Mr. Shaw had been an Italian he would either have been in exile or in prison." Another oversight of some consequence is the failure to list C. H. Rickword's "Bernard Shaw" ( Scrutinies 5) in The Calendar of Modern Letters for September 1925 (2: 50-54). Rickword was the cousin of Edgell Rickword, coeditor with Douglas Garman of the periodical. Wearing, incidentally, does not list The Calendar in his "Index of Periodicals and Newspapers." As with most of the other resurrected pieces Rickword's essay should be read in its entirety; I shall quote only enough to reveal his preoccupations. In respect, then, of the destructive side of his work, Mr. Shaw would seem to be in danger of the usual ironical fate of the artist who bends his art to the direct improvement (by flogging) of his age. The more successfully such an artist diagnoses and lashes the follies, which are commonly the ephemeral manners, of his time, the more swiftly and completely does his value to posterity depend on his purely literary virtues of wit in arrangement and language. . . . Even his technique is an adaptation to the purposes of the theatre of the methods of the revivalist preacher, who, seeking to turn men from their wickedness, contrasts their sin and wretchedness with his own inner vision of happy righteousness, seasoning the whole with threats of hell. . . . The charge that to Mr. Shaw actors are puppets to be put up to spout Shavians ideas and oratory is familiar. . . . Whenever possible, he employs the purely mechanical method of collecting his persons from as many different social strata as possible. (51) Rickword remarks that "jocosities punctuate nearly all Mr. Shaw's elevated passages. That, beyond irritating by their cheapness, they do not jar, proves not their aptness, but the justness of Mr. Shaw's suspicion of the quality of the preceding heroics" (52). He concludes, after some more remarks about Shaw's unfortunate jokes and his tendency to write melodrama with his tongue in his cheek ( The Devil's Disciple , for example), with his comparison of Shaw with Shakespeare. Shakespeare approached reality unprejudiced by any ethical conception, whereas Mr. Shaw approaches it with a scale of values founded on an abhorrence of human nature and a conviction of its original and unredeemable sinfulness. The dramas that result, far from attempting a reconciliation of life in the classical manner, are purely romantic flights from reality. In his revulsion, Mr. Shaw has constructed a universe as purely in his own image as Shelley's. But whereas Shelley is enabled to secure acceptance by his literary equipment as a poet and by the preservation in his universe of many human qualities in a etherialised form, Mr. Shaw has on his side only oratory and the puritanical conscience. So that, when we are offered the alternative of serving God in Mr. Shaw's way or of being scrapped by the life force (or in other words, being sent to Hell), it is excusable if we regard the choice as being between assasination and suicide—and decline to comply either way. One final, minor, note. The June 18, 1932, New Statesman and Nation (N.S. 3, no. 69, 794) carried an "Appeal" on behalf of Councillor W. G. Ballinger who went to South Africa as technical adviser of a native Trade Union organization. Ballinger had been financed by grants from individuals and by the international and British Trade Union movements. The trust fund was now depleted and the signatories to the appeal asked for contributions to afford Ballinger £100 a year salary and £100 a year for expenses. Shaw's name headed the list of signatories, H. G. Wells's was second, and there were fourteen others, including Archbishop William M. Carter and three noblemen. 4</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dreiser's " Genius " in the Making: Composition and Revision by Louis J. Oldani</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Inauguration of the Pennsylvania Edition of the complete works of Theodore Dreiser, which promises to rival such projects as the Mark Twain edition centered at Berkeley, is prompting explanation of the genesis, the composition and revision, and the printing and publishing history of each work in the Dreiser canon as needed to establish the definitive version of each text. The present paper accounts for the protracted stages of composition and revision that textual critics must assess to produce such an edition of The "Genius" . The aim of this paper is to shed light on the first edition of The "Genius" , published in October 1915, beginning with the earliest but abortive draft of 1900, proceeding to the complete holograph of 1910-1911, successive typescripts and revisions, and, finally, key differences between galley proofs and the published novel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holograph Rereading the extensive correspondence between Dreiser and himself, H. L. Mencken inquired on 23 February 1943: "[O]n August 8, 1911, you speak of 'The Financier' as your fourth book and hint that there was a third running ahead of it, just after 'Jennie Gerhardt'. Did this so-called third book ever have any real existence?" 1 "In 1903," Dreiser replied, "while dreaming of doing Jennie Gerhardt, I wrote 32 chapters of what was to be The 'Genius', and in 1907 or 1908, tore them up and burned them in order to do Jennie Gerhardt, etc. etc." ( Dreiser-Mencken 2: 684). In December 1910 Dreiser had begun a second version of The "Genius" . In a letter to Mencken of 24 February 1911, Dreiser had stated, "I have just finished one book—Jennie Gerhardt—and am half through with another [ The "Genius" ]" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 63). He added that he expected to continue "this book game" until he had written four or five, "after which unless I am enjoying a good income from them I will quit." "Give the game a fair trial: you have got the goods," Mencken advised, "and soon or late the fact will penetrate the skulls of those who have anything within. . . . The money be damned" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 64). Dreiser answered, "I sometimes think my desire is for expression that is entirely too frank for this time—hence that I must pay the price of being unpalatable. The next book [ The "Genius" ] will tell" (10 March 1911, Dreiser-Mencken 1: 65). 2 On 24 March 1911, Dreiser wrote Mary Annabel Fanton Roberts, who had helped to edit Jennie Gerhardt , that The "Genius" was "nearing completion." 3 On 10 April, he wrote Mencken that he hoped to conclude the manuscript by 1 May, noting on 17 April that it "draws to a close. Its grim, I'm sorry to state, but life-like" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 67). On 28 April he mentioned to Mencken that he was "finishing" The "Genius" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 71). "I completed the third book sometime ago— The Genius — 425,000 words," he wrote Mrs. Roberts on 26 June (UPDC). And to Mencken on 8 August he wrote, "Yes, book three is done &amp; being typewritten slowly" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 73). The typing must have progressed at a glacial pace. Though in a 15 October letter to William C. Lengel, formerly an editorial assistant of Dreiser's on the Delineator , Dreiser claimed that The "Genius" was "now lying on ice, all nicely typewritten," on 17 October he informed Margery Dell that he was still awaiting part of the typescript and on the same day assured Mencken that the full typescript would soon be ready for him. 4 After the abortive start which Dreiser later recalled as an event of 1903, he had begun again to write The "Genius" late in 1910, shortly after his calamitous affair with Thelma Cudlipp. 5 According to his letter to Mrs. Roberts, he completed the holograph draft before 26 June 1911, probably in May. And during the summer of 1911 Decima Vivian set to work on the typescript.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prepublication Reactions Wishing to sample responses to his first completed draft of The "Genius" , Dreiser got Eleanora R. O'Neill, Barbara Langford, Lillian Rosenthal, and, later, Anna P. Tatum to read the typescript. O'Neill, the Boston book reviewer, praised Dreiser's portrayal of characters "in broad master stokes," but complained of a surfeit of details. 6 "[M]erely suggest things with your vigorous strokes—don't explain and draw every line," she advised. Langford and Rosenthal, who had influenced Dreiser's reshaping of Jennie Gerhardt from a happy to a tragic ending, acclaimed The "Genius," which Rosenthal nonetheless believed could be "cut to advantage." 7 She remarked further: "I think you need to introduce . . . a reason for this man's peculiar passion for a certain type of woman." This time, however, Dreiser did not follow Rosenthal's suggestion. On 20 December 1912, Dreiser arrived in Chicago for a stay lasting until 10 February 1913, to investigate the phase of Charles Tyson Yerkes's career pertinent to his writing of The Titan . During that visit, according to Lengel's 1962 testimony, Dreiser gave Lengel a carbon copy of The "Genius" typescript "to read and pass on to [Floyd] Dell, Lucian Cary [participant in the Chicago literary revolution], and Ray Long," editor of Red Book (Swanberg 166, 549 n. 9). Moreover, Donald Pizer mentions, Dreiser left behind the typescript brought especially for Lengel's perusal "to be read by Edgar Lee Masters . . . among others" ( Novels 133-134). A question occurs about Lengel's 1962 recollection inasmuch as on 14 February 1913 Lengel wrote asking Dreiser for a copy of The "Genius" so that he could begin excerpting a serial as Dreiser had requested (UPDC). Shortly thereafter he informed Dreiser: "Have worked over 'The Genius' all day and think I've got the line on the serial. Hope I can get the remaining chapters soon" (undated, UPDC). After cursory examination of the story, Lengel turned over the typescript, as Dreiser wished, to Cary and to Dell (Lengel to Dreiser, 21 Feb. 1913, UPDC). Apparently Lengel had received this duplicate copy of the typescript through Ray Long, whose estimate Lengel inaccurately summarized in a letter of 21 February: "Long says you have produced a master piece that will in itself make you famous, if nothing else will (UPDC). In a letter of 7 March, however, Lengel expressed concern following a meeting with Cary and Dell, each of whom promised to send Dreiser a "complete outline" of his opinions on The "Genius" , opinions "of such a nature that I do not think that I had better do any work on the book until I hear from you after you get these communications" (UPDC). On 15 March, Lengel wrote Dreiser that Dell had returned The "Genius" ; and on 20 March, "I am reading 'The Genius' with painstaking care and want to finish it before writing you fully" (UPDC). By 28 March, Lengel had completed his reading and, as Dreiser had instructed, given the copy to Masters (Lengel to Dreiser, 29 March 1913, UPDC). On 31 March, Lengel reported to Dreiser his reaction to "The Genius," noting that his "brash statements" were "written with honesty and sincerity" and also anguish. 8 Lengel had recognized living originals in the various characters as well as the troubled state of mind in which Dreiser wrote the story. "When I think of . . . the pain it caused you in chronicling the story, . . . I am tempted to say, publish it." But Lengel expressed the conviction that a five-year delay in publication might enable Dreiser to gain "a different perspective" on the subject. Furthermore, Lengel found that the plot "lacks cohesiveness" as events of life do, that the characters seem bereft of purpose and relationship, that Witla is neither an admirable nor a sympathetic figure. Dreiser rejoined that most reactions so far had been favorable (see Lengel to Dreiser, 19 April 1913, UPDC). On 9 April, however, Dreiser received Long's critique: namely, that "The Genius" seemed "too much a blue print," "went into details of life in a country town . . . which could not possibly grip a reader," then "was told in a sort of brutality" after Witla reaches the city (UPDC). This most autobiographical of Dreiser's novels evoked responses of approval from women who read the first full draft even as it wakened objections from the earliest male readers. When Dreiser sought the judgment of Anna P. Tatum, she commended the "form of the book," which struck her as "identical" with its message (Tatum to Dreiser, 12 April 1913, UPDC). She described the novel as the most "searching . . . portrayal of an unhappy sex relationship . . . in any literature" and credited it with "'laying bare the human heart' . . . with a kind of shameless primitive Biblical solemnity." The opinion of the handsome Miss Tatum, "a scholar who could quote Verlaine in French, knew all the great novels (putting his own near the top)," carried weight with Dreiser (Swanberg 162). Decima Vivian, too, must have sounded convincing when she commented to Dreiser that in "The Genius," by his focus on "the usual, the typical" in American life, he might fulfill a prophecy attributed to Arnold Bennett that Dreiser would write the great American novel. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ancestral Descent of the Text Whether with dissent or praise, readers of the typescript were reacting to a different version of The "Genius" than was published in 1915. Yet, as Dreiser remarked in 1943, neither the typescript nor the extant holograph contains the original form of the story. In situating the first attempt in 1903, however, Dreiser's memory may have been approximate. Early in the summer of 1900, elated by Frank Norris's advocacy and Walter Hines Page's promise to publish Sister Carrie , Dreiser had begun an autobiographical novel called "The Rake" and by December had written thirty or more chapters. 10 Sometime in July 1900, uncertain that Doubleday, Page and Company would keep its promise, he confided to Arthur Henry the hope that "my forthcoming book ["The Rake"], (which, if I can raise the money I shall write this winter)," might induce Doubleday to "publish Sister Carrie and preserve my credit" ([23] July 1900, Letters 1: 53). Dreiser added that he would leave no room for queries in this next novel: "Those who have feelings may prepare to have them shaken. It shall be out of my heart truly." After having completed thirty or more chapters by the end of 1900, Dreiser stopped work on "The Rake" and turned to creating Jennie Gerhardt and to other writing. Correspondence and other records of 1903 contain no hint of a return to work on "The Rake" or the start of another autobiographical novel. Only after a decade, in December 1910, did Dreiser direct his energies to another version of the autobiographical novel. In 1972 Robert Elias commented on Dreiser's original version of The "Genius" , but did not conjecture, as did the writer of a dissertation of the same year, that the small yellowed sheets of paper on which Dreiser wrote this version "lend probability to the 1903 composition date" recalled by Dreiser or, perhaps more precisely, to 1900: "The small yellow[ed] sheets are the kind of paper on which Sister Carrie was written." 11 "The Rake" of 1900 survives, Thomas P. Riggio points out, "on the small yellow sheets . . . in the manuscript of The History of Myself , vol. 2," A Book About Myself , for the most part written in ink on 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheets of white paper but "contain[ing] as well," Donald Pizer has observed, "lengthy sections on small yellow sheets, written in pencil, which are pasted in the larger, white sheet holograph." 12 "Dreiser used these yellow sheets, on which he wrote Sister Carrie and the chapters of Jennie [ Gerhardt ] he finished in 1901-2, only in this period," Riggio explains. "When he returned to Jennie in 1910, he began using the standard-size typewriter paper he would continue to write on for the rest of his career." These penciled portions are to such a degree autobiographical that Dreiser inserted them into A Book About Myself with no other revision than substitution of the first-person pronoun in place of "Eugene." Thus Dreiser did not feed the chapters of "The Rake" to the fire as he reported in 1943, but incorporated most of them into the account of his newspaper days. The extant typescript of The "Genius" , like the holograph copy and the published text, has as its hero Eugene Witla, the artist. Unlike the published version, but in accordance with the holograph, it contains the reconciliation and marriage of Witla and Suzanne Dale. Whether any part of the two complete typescripts of The "Genius" in the University of Pennsylvania Dreiser Collection is a remnant of the 1911 typescript or whether they date in full from 1913 or 1914 is a matter of debate. Elias posits a 1913 typescript prepared after Dreiser had supposedly revised the one typed by Decima Vivian in 1911, but no longer in existence ("Bibliography" 31). Citing Dreiser's letter to Mencken of 22 June 1914, Joseph Katz has stated: "If Dreiser was not simply stalling Mencken, 'two complete typewritten copies' of the novel had been lost and were slowly being replaced in June 1914, when they were 'nearly recopied.'" 13 Loss of the typescript read in Chicago by Long, Cary, Dell, and Lengel was the complicating incident in the ancestral descent of The "Genius" from manuscript to published text. When Lengel had read the typescript, he turned the copy over to Edgar Lee Masters before 29 March 1913 (Lengel to Dreiser, 29 March 1913, UPDC). But owing to his wife's illness, Masters had no opportunity to read it. Masters "wants to read it badly, but says if you are in an especial hurry he will let me have it to return to you at once," Lengel wrote Dreiser on 27 April 1913 (UPDC). On 2 May, Lengel mailed the typescript to Dreiser, mentioning in a note on 3 May, "Masters seemed surprised that you should want it back, as he said you had told him you have another copy of the book in N.Y." (UPDC). The mailed copy did not reach Dreiser. Lengel had the Post Office attempt to trace the package, laying the blame to his own "carelessness" in not having sent it express (Lengel to Dreiser, 15 May 1913, UPDC). Dreiser graciously accepted this loss both of his typescript and of Lengel's serial editing. "The Post Office made a careful search," Lengel recalled, "and Dreiser decided that it had been received by his wife and destroyed. She hated the work, as well she might." 14 Dreiser assured Lengel that the loss "was not vital because there was a copy in the safe at Harper's." However, Dreiser's letter of 24 February 1913 to Major F. T. Leigh, vice president of Harper and Brothers, then Dreiser's publisher, raises the question of when, if ever, a typescript was entrusted to the firm: "As I told you, the ms. of The Genius is now in Chicago but will be back in a month. When it comes back I will turn it over to you" (UPDC). Nine months later, on 6 December 1913, Dreiser gave a typescript of "The Genius" to the Century Company as security against a small loan (Swanberg 170). One can only guess where the first typescript was in mid-July 1913, when Dreiser wrote the following ambiguous note to Mencken, who was awaiting a script of "The Genius": "The second &amp; only remaining copy (type) of the Genius was lost in the mails. Loss $135 0 . A recopying is necessary. When it is done will let you know." 15 To Mencken's queries of "What progress with 'The Genius'?" Dreiser replied on 25 March 1914: "I am preparing The Genius of which more later." 16 Since November 1913, Mencken had been urging Dreiser to publish The Titan as soon as possible after A Traveler at Forty ; "And let that story of the artist (When am I going to see it?) follow quickly" [16 November 1913], Dreiser-Mencken 1: 125-126). "Let me see 'The Genius' as soon as possible," Mencken pressed (10 June and 26 June 1914, Dreiser-Mencken 1: 142-144). "The Genius of which I lost two complete typewritten copies worth $175 0 all told is nearly recopied," Dreiser explained on 22 June 1914 ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 144). "I am to try to edit it next month—and I am such a poor editor." "All of this 2nd typing of The Genius isn't here yet," Dreiser added on 2 July ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 145). "When it comes and I have had a chance to run over it myself I will send it on. I am most anxious to know what you think and that long before I publish it." "Send on The Genius whenever it's ready," Mencken requested. 17 "Is there any chance of getting a few chapters of 'The Genius' for our Dec. no.?" Mencken asked shortly after he and George Jean Nathan had got editorial control of The Smart Set . 18 On 17 September 1914, Dreiser responded: Did you write [J. Jefferson] Jones [American director of the John Lane Company, now Dreiser's publisher] to hurry up the copying of the remaining chapters of "The Genius"? I doubt whether anything can be done about that for the the Smart Set. If I could cut a salable serial out of it I would want to get a reasonable price for it. ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 157) Mencken replied: "It's too bad we can't get a hack at the Genius. We don't want a serial, but merely an episode." 19 In fact, Dreiser had already arranged for serial editing by Lengel, who had written Dreiser on 18 April 1914: "I am very enthusiastic about the prospects of doing that work on The Genius" (UPDC). Mencken insisted on publishing an episode from The "Genius" because he envisioned it, in contrast to Dreiser's recent plays, as "a return to C major—that is, to the Sister Carrie-Jennie Gerhardt—The Titan style." 20 On 8 November 1914, Mencken reminded Dreiser, "Don't forget that I am to get a reading of 'The Genius'" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 164). Lengel's serial cutting was under way on 10 November 1914, when Dreiser commented to Mencken: I have on hand chapter 1 to 61 inc of "The Genius"—rather badly pencil marked because (for serial purposes), certain things were marked to be left out. I am promised 62 to 104 this Saturday—marked in the same way. Now I could wait until I get all of this stuff in hand and having turned it over to Lane for safe keeping send you the unmarked copy they have, but Jones rather objects to that. 21 In this letter, Dreiser expressed hesitation about sending Mencken the copy marked "for serial purposes" ("Nothing is cut out—only portions marked out") because he had not yet done his own editing for book publication: "I have been going over one copy but I am not near done and when I am it will be somewhat better pulled together than it is now and better written." "Let me have the pencilled copy, by all means," Mencken replied, promising to bear in mind its provisional character (12 November 1914, Dreiser-Mencken 1: 165). "By Adams express, today," wrote Dreiser on 30 November, "prepaid I sent you chapters 1 to 66 (I believe) of the typewritten mss—of "The Genius', 2nd carbon, unrevised." 22 "In all likelihood," Joseph Katz inferred, "the marked-up script Mencken did not get to see is the one surviving in the Van Pelt Library [of the University of Pennsylvania]" ("Dummy: The 'Genius'" : 337). Dreiser's use of "unrevised" refers here, however, not to serial cutting, but to Dreiser's own projected editing for book publication, as he indicated in the letter of 10 November. That Mencken received the typescript penciled for serial publication is clear from Dreiser's letter of 8 December: By Adams express tomorrow I expect to send you the remainder of the marked mss of "The Genius" I hope you manage to retain an unfixed state of mind as regards the ultimate technique of this thing. I am pruning and editing all the way through taking out a number things which, in the mss you have, stand as severe blemishes. I wonder if you would care to give me an opinion on the 100,000 word serial which has been cut from this. . . . 23 "Surely I'll be glad to go through the proposed serial," Mencken answered (9 December 1914, Dreiser-Mencken 1: 168-169). "The crude cuts, of course, leave the thing as it stands rather disjointed, but I think I grasp its general drift." And on 10 December, Dreiser responded: You seem to be under the impression that the cuts which appear in the mss you are examining have something to do with its preparation for book form They have nothing to do with it whatsoever. I merely sent you that because the clean mss which is being edited for book purposes is in use. Those cuts . . . relate to a 100,000 word serial which was cut out of the mss. In reading that mss read through cuts and all. Disregard all changes except where they are made in my own hand. 24 On 12 December, Dreiser sent Mencken the second half of the marked typescript. 25 By this halfway point, Mencken had offered two "criticisms": first, "Witla's artistic progress is under-described . . . down to his New York days"; second, "there is no such word as 'alright'" (9 December 1914, Dreiser-Mencken 1: 168-169). In fact, the misspelling was a corruption introduced, not by Dreiser, but by the typist. Dreiser wrote "all right" in the holograph. As a remedy for what he considered insufficient development of Witla's artistic growth prior to his New York days, Mencken suggested: "Start him in Chicago, cutting out the Alexandria part, and then go back to it briefly later on, a la Joseph Conrad" ( Dreiser-Mencken 1: 168-169). Shortly before receiving Mencken's "criticisms," Dreiser had alerted Mencken to the distinctive punctuation of the title, not yet, however, in its final form. "Please note that the title, 'The Genius' is quoted," Dreiser wrote on 30 November 1914; In some reference to it in Town Topics it was mentioned as The Genius—unquoted. This reference has been going the rounds as my clippings show. There is another book, still on sale in old book stores called The Genius—a Russian locale. To avoid being bothered by the author and to convey the exact question which I mean to imply I am quoting my title. 26 This appears to be Dreiser's first written statement to account for use of quotation marks in the title. On 5 January 1915, Mencken personally returned the typescript to Dreiser. 27 It was then that he orally delivered his preliminary "kicks and suggestions" regarding The "Genius" , but no record of his comments was made. Nor did Dreiser carry out the restructuring suggested in Mencken's 9 December 1914 letter. Such was the context of circumstances immediately preceding revision of the typescript for publication by the John Lane Company. At the center of these events was the text of The "Genius" , extant in several forms in the Theodore Dreiser Collection of the University of Pennsylvania: the complete holograph copy, on white paper 8 1/2 by 11 inches ("Handwritten MS." [Boxes 156 through 159, formerly 79 to 83]); two typescripts ("First Typed Copy" [Boxes 162 and 163, formerly 84 and 85] and "Complete MS.—First Carbon Copy" [Boxes 160 and 161, formerly 87]; and a third typescript, "from which [the] first edition was printed," but missing Chapters 1 through 31 ("Revised Typescript [Incomplete]" [Box 164, formerly 86a and 86b]). The notation on the third typescript is in Dreiser's hand, including "(Chapters 1 to 31—missing)." In the case of any given chapter, the three typewritten copies are the result of the same typewriting; but the whole is not necessarily the product of a single typist and clearly not of the same typewriter. The type is pica in Chapters 1 through 31, becomes elite in Chapter 32 and remains so until Chapter 81, in which it again becomes pica. As insertion of their initials in the holograph copy testifies, at least two typists produced the 1911 typescript of The "Genius" : D. V. (Decima Vivian), who began the task and whose initials appear in notes in the first thirty chapters; and E. H. W. (unidentified), whose initials appear in notations in later chapters. Owing to the lack of additional evidence, it is impossible to establish that either or both typists produced the 1914 typescript. For the 1914 typescript, the change in typeface suggests either the hand of more than one typist or extensive changes exacted by Dreiser during the course of one typist's work: for example, Angela's hair is "red" in the manuscript, "bright" in the first thirty chapters of the typescript, and "red" in subsequent chapters. A word on the correspondence between contents and labels of Boxes 160, 161, 162, and 163 (formerly 84, 85, and 87). Boxes 162 and 163 (84 and 85) do not contain, as indicated, entirely a ribbon copy of the text, nor do Boxes 160 and 161 (87) contain simply a carbon copy. 28 In stacking the three copies of The "Genius", Dreiser or an assistant probably was not concerned about keeping separate the ribbon copy from the first and second carbon copies, but indifferently mixed the three forms. The designation of Boxes 160 and 161 (87) as "Complete MS." is correct, however: copy of Chapters 19-21 and 28-31, missing from Box 162 (84), is not lacking in Box 160 (87).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Revision of the Manuscript Dreiser did not use the typewriter in composition. 29 He wrote in ink, the lines of legible words evenly spaced on white paper. Multiple revisions, by himself and by others, were part of his method, stemming, perhaps, from the practice learned in journalism of turning over one's writing to be reworked by an assistant city editor. 30 Comparison of the manuscript or holograph copy of The "Genius" with the typescript in Boxes 162 (84) and 163 (85) and, when necessary, in Boxes 160 and 161 (87) reveals a large number of changes. On the holograph and also the "First Typed Copy," the title appears without quotation marks. A second cover sheet only in the holograph copy bears Dreiser's handwritten note: "Alternate Titles. Would those who read this manuscript kindly indicate here any other title which may occur to them as appropriate and forceful. Or check the one they prefer. This Matter of Marriage, Now. The Story of Eugene. Eugene Witla. The Hedonist. The Dreamer. The Sensualist." Like the holograph, the "First Typed Copy," but not the "First Carbon Copy," contains Dreiser's cautionary word following the title-page. The author asks of each reader of "this story" that she or he not pass it "indiscriminately into the hands of the too young. Its psychology and philosophy should forfend it against general and immature reading but there are those who read only for suggestive incidents." Of "the elders" who might be offended by action diverging from current conventions, he appeals that they "suspend judgment until the last page is reached." 31 Many variants in the typescript resulted from errors, omissions, or alterations by the typist. 32 One of the most pervasive variants in the typescript is the alteration of Dreiser's paragraphing in the holograph, either by dividing a single paragraph into two or more or by combining separate paragraphs into one. 33 In addition to the misspelling of "all right," the typist introduced the incorrect "Strathmeyer" for "Shottmeyer" and "Smith" for "Smite." 34 The order of items in a series is sometimes transposed in the typescript, words and phrases omitted, punctuation replaced. 35 Such changes are usually of minor significance; but in instances in which the altered passage was not excised in subsequent revision, the original form is well-nigh always restored in the published version. Weightier changes also appear in the typescript, however, as a result either of Dreiser's penciled revisions in the holograph or of his supposed revisions of the 1911 typescript (see Elias, "Bibliography": 30-34). A striking instance of such revision occurs in Chapter 34 of the typescript and of the holograph (Book 2, Chapter 3, of the published text). The typescript incorporates material penciled by Dreiser on the holograph concerning the relationship of the newly married Witla and Angela—namely, the expression of his worry and of her dissatisfaction over Witla's not having informed his family and friends of the wedding. In Chapter 40 (Book 2, Chapter 9), the typescript omits Eugene's contemptuous thoughts about Angela's knowing little outside conventional rules, a passage which Dreiser had marked for deletion on the holograph. The typescript omits from Chapter 43 (Book 3, Chapter 11) three brief paragraphs, crossed out by Dreiser in the holograph, which present Angela's wish that Witla be morally impeccable as well as Witla's problem of how long he can endure his failing marriage. The typescript similarly omits from Chapter 48 (Book 2, Chapter 17) a paragraph cancelled by Dreiser which expresses Witla's reflection that it will be easier to bear the siege of breakdown alone, without Angela to feel sorry for, and his sense of relief that there are no children to care for. Another alteration from the manuscript is the supplying in Chapter 104 (Book 3, Chapter 28) of Witla's rumination on his recent conduct, including his rueful attitude toward Suzanne. Pointing out discrepancies between the holograph and what he calls "the 1913 typescript," Elias cites in the manuscript further conversations between Witla and Althea Johns, the Christian Science practitioner, further letters between Witla and Suzanne, etc. ("Bibliography": 34-44, especially 38). Elias interprets such deletions mainly as authorial comment containing no dramatic or thematic force. Yet some of the revisions which Elias notes and each of the changes cited from my own investigation involves Dreiser's characterization of Witla and of Angela either by clarifying motive or by striking out an explanation or too close an autobiographical parallel, the latter seemingly a step in the transformation of lived experience into literary form. More salient than the discrepancies between typescript and holograph, however, is what they hold in common, in particular the happy ending of Witla's story. For one thing, they present Witla's personal acceptance of Christian Science and the spiritual nature of reality. For another, remaining haunted by the image of Suzanne, herself still deeply affected, Witla at first resents her for having abandoned him in the climax of passion. Later, as his practice of art distracts him from bitter feelings, he writes to Suzanne to explain his altered view of life, his recognition of his selfishness, and his realization that desire is not everything. He also asks that she either return or destroy his letters. Subsequently, they meet on Fifth Avenue at Thirty-Fourth Street. Smiling but aloof, Witla "had himself well in hand." As they part, he aches a little; Suzanne is left wondering about his feeling for her. A month afterward, she visits his studio in Montclair, where "unregenerate, love-tortured" Witla asks, "'You love me then?'" "'Ah, yes! yes! yes!'" Suzanne replies, and "with that old time cry that brought back a lost paradise to him she yielded herself to his eager . . . arms." 36 Witla and Suzanne marry six months later and achieve unity also of soul ("L'Envoi"). His interest in idealism has become part of his pursuit of beauty. Life for him "was no longer the thing it had once seemed. It was calmer, sweeter. 'There is a ruling power,' he said. 'It rules all—is all, and it is not malicious.'" Comparison of typescript and holograph yields information on a further matter. In letters, Dreiser mentioned his deficiency in knowledge of grammar and syntax. To May Calvert Baker, a former teacher, he wrote on 15 February 1917: "Do you recall that I couldn't learn grammar? I don't know a single thing about it yet" (UPDC; also Dreiser to Baker, 23 July 1917, UPDC). To Robert James Ullman, who complained of grammatical errors in the published "Genius" , Dreiser wrote: In regard to grammar and syntax I write as some people play—by ear. Grammar was ever a mystery to me and I never mastered its rules. Yet, of course, some of them I understand very well and adhere to their commands. . . . Personally I wish it were possible to find an editor whose grammatical and stylistic decisions would be acceptable to all,—the critics especially. (6 October 1921, Letters 1: 384) Yet Dreiser's slips in grammar and spelling during the writing of the holograph seem inconsequential. In Chapters 10 and 33, for instance, he uses "your" for "you're," fails to use the possessive case in Chapter 13, and misspells "across" with two c 's in Chapter 20. In Chapter 79, he misspells "divine" "devine"; in Chapter 80, he uses e instead of a in "thousand"; in Chapters 80, 90, and 91, he punctuates with a period when a question mark is needed. In sum, this is evidence that Dreiser was maladept neither at spelling nor at grammar, though his typists were. The typescript contains several times the number of errors in the holograph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sequential Revision of the Typescript Tracing the chronology of revision, one notes that Dreiser's editing appears not only in the holograph, but also on the typescript altered for publication of the first edition of The "Genius" (Box 164, formerly Boxes 86a and 86b). In addition to Dreiser's, however, other revisory hands can be identified on this typescript, notably those of Frederic Chapman, English reader for and confidential adviser to John Lane, the British publisher, and Floyd Dell, formerly an editor of the "Friday Literary Review" of the Chicago Evening Post and then an editor of The Masses . Since this typescript lacks Chapters 1 through 31, comparison of the text of those chapters in the holograph and in the other two typescripts with that of the galleys of The "Genius" , which reproduce the revised typescript of Box 164 (86a and 86b), enables one to infer the general pattern of changes made, though not, in the absence of Chapters 1 through 31, the specific roles of the revisors of those chapters. The rest of the revised typescript, on the other hand, from Chapter 32 through "L'Envoi," permits one to eavesdrop on a group effort in revision. To one familiar with his handwriting, Dreiser's alterations, made mainly in black or blue pencil and blue crayon, are most easily identifiable, but least extensive. Chapman's alterations, in small clear letters, often singly inscribed, are uniformly in red ink. The content of some of Chapman's comments makes them unmistakably his: "This side at any rate pastels are not done on canvas" (381); "The sentence in brackets is incomprehensible, to an Englishman at any rate" (675); "Simile meaningless to an English ear" (744). Dell's alterations, made in separate instances in green ink, black pencil, and typewriting, can be identified (as can Chapman's) by reference to the handwriting in his letters to Dreiser. 37 A great deal has been said about Dreiser's method of revising his work. But the services of editors who excised thousands of words to improve the novel is a point usually stressed, sometimes with the claim that Dreiser restored most of the deletions. Collation of the revised typescript with the galleys and with the published text of The "Genius" shows that Dreiser accepted the majority of cuts recommended by Chapman and by Dell. "Being a prolific and voluminous writer with a tendency to repetition," remarked Helen Dreiser, "Dreiser was convinced of the need for cutting, and although he himself had had wide experience as an editor, he often said a fresh eye . . . was . . . helpful to him." 38 But, she added, Dreiser was not quick to make or accept changes in his style or structure. Dreiser's own editing of the "Revised Typescript [Incomplete]," most of it carried out from fall into winter in 1914, is more abundant than his manuscript editing and has greater effect on theme and structure. 39 His typescript revisions most notably include a large number of additions and deletions of words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs; numerous substitutions of words and phrases; frequent combination or restructuring or division of paragraphs (sometimes restoring them to their shape in the holograph); and, most important, such rewriting as transformed the original happy ending into Witla's grim experience of losing Suzanne and being at last, not converted to idealism, but "only hardened intellectually and emotionally—tempered for life and work" (734). When textural, these alterations seem attempts to conserve words and details, to supply more accurate diction, and to make blocks of sentences coincide with blocks of meaning, without modifying the overall design of the novel. When architectonic, however, as in the reshaped ending, they represent Dreiser's effort to bring fictional experience into closer relationship with life as he understood it. Dreiser's revisions of the title occurred after those of the typescript. He originally spelled the title without quotation marks, as in the holograph and the "First Typed Copy" of 1914. He used no quotation marks in the title until around 30 November 1914, when he enclosed both words of the title in a pair of double quotation marks. 40 The final version of the title he adopted by 4 August 1915, when he wrote on the verso of page 576 of what he inscribed as "Revised Typewritten Copy from which 1st Edition was printed": "Received, J. J. Little &amp; Ives Co., Aug. 4 12:55 PM 1915" (Box 164, formerly 86b). The "Genius" was published on 1 October 1915. 41 Instances in the revised typescript of Dreiser's effort to employ more precise diction are found, for example, in his penciling in "canvas" for "drawing" and "painting" for "pastel" (as Chapman advised). 42 More often, Dreiser added to the text some corroborative action or illumination of motive: renewed push in Angela's drive to improve her husband's conduct; presentation of White's open-armed reception of Witla's disaffected staff members and his hostile attitude concerning Witla's position in the United Magazine Corporation; Witla's remark to Suzanne that her love has made him "the artist again," but her failure to understand his meaning. 43 After the affair with Suzanne is under way, Dreiser added a sentence to clarify Witla's decision not to desert Angela financially, but to live with her no longer. After two chapters calling for little revision—Chapter 84 (Book 3, Chapter 9), in which Angela discovers Suzanne in Witla's arms in the Witla apartment, and Chapter 85 (Book 9, Chapter 10), the resulting verbal and emotional tug of war between Witla and Angela—Dreiser added a sizeable handwritten passage at the beginning of Chapter 86 (3, 11). The insertion indicates that by dawn of the morning following Angela's discovery, none of the three is further along the way toward sorting thoughts, that each dimly anticipates tragedy looming ahead. It also probes the attitude of each: Witla's terror lest Suzanne undergo a change of heart; Suzanne's easier cast of mind, believing that such situations ameliorate of their own accord if one lets them and that, "if it must be," she can live without Witla; Angela's sense of shock and despair. In Witla's misapprehension, upon finding Suzanne in her coat, that "she had been intending to slip away without seeing him any more," Dreiser reveals how little Witla knew Suzanne. In other additions, Dreiser emphasizes Witla's intimation of the folly and danger of his marital infidelity and elucidates Witla's double financial jeopardy in the set-back to his real estate investment. He added vivid detail to the scenes of Angela's Caesarean section as well as a note of relief in the sentence, "But the child was crying too, healthily." Each addition seems to carry its charge of meaning and feeling, each designed to prepare the reader for the newly darkened ending of the story. On the other hand, Dreiser made numerous deletions from the typescript. 44 But more evident than concern about economy of words is attention to credibility, as in Dreiser's removal of several sentences indicating the respect in which celebrated persons held Witla's early art work. He crossed out the names of Howells, Twain, William James, and others. Again, he excised such authorial comment as "Pages and pages . . . might be devoted to just such tirades as these," to begin a chapter instead in medias res : "For hours that night . . . the storm continued." He rejected comment explaining once again the breakup of Witla and Angela's relationship: a retrospective view, for example, of how Witla had learned through his sister's accidental discovery that Angela is older than he, of Angela's pleasing traits but failure finally to harmonize with Witla's moods and feelings, of Witla's past amours and weakness for girls of eighteen, and of Angela's mistaken belief that Witla would feel irrevocably tied by the marriage vow. The list could be extended. Though in many instances the reshaping was minor, it was Dreiser's rewriting that made the most determinative impact on The "Genius" . 45 He recast a paragraph, for example, describing Witla's reactions to London and to Paris by sharpening his sense of contrast between the cities. He rewrote a scene, making Witla weigh more cautiously the disquieting image of Suzanne in a photograph, a medium that Witla viewed as too often deceptive in capturing only a flattering surface. In Chapter 95—a scissors-and-paste chapter with a narrow majority of the copy in typescript, the rest in Dreiser's hand—he changed Witla's firm determination to regain Suzanne into a drifting and temporizing attitude about how to cope with obstacles to that goal. But his transformation of the novel's ending was the decisive alteration, rescuing the story from the experience of marital bliss for a man who had inexplicably converted from skepticism, antinomianism, and hedonism to belief in Christian Science and a style of behavior about which one can only guess. This major revision brought the final events and characterization into accord with the realistic perspective of the foregoing chapters and of Dreiser's theory of fiction. "I am for the type of fiction that confines its attempted interpretations to not only the possibilities but the probabilities," he explained in "The Scope of Fiction," "and I have no reading patience with anything that does not compel me by the charm of its verisimilitude." 46 After Dreiser, the next major revisor of the typescript of The "Genius" was Frederic Chapman. Chapman wrote Dreiser on 26 May 1914 thanking him for "an advance copy of The Titan with such a flattering inscription" and asking to see copy of Dreiser's next book "before it goes to the printer" (UPDC). He added that he valued "getting the sense of a great personality" and "its environment" rather than "comparative trifles," but placed at Dreiser's disposal his extensive knowledge of "minutiae, little side things that tell in the matter of truth to period." On 8 July 1915, Chapman returned to Dreiser the first fifty chapters of the typescript of The "Genius" with his revisions, and on 15 July, Chapters 51 through 75, with the promise that the next mail would bring the remainder. "I have not altered . . . expressions put in the mouths of your characters," Chapman stated in the letter of 8 July (UPDC). "But when the text is purely narrative, . . . I have endeavoured to bring it more into accordance with traditional English with the fewest possible changes." One of Chapman's duties for John Lane was to insure that English readers not suffer bemusement in encountering The "Genius" . The text had to be so edited as to be intelligible to British as well as American readers. That achieved, the British publisher could print an overrun of sheets, publish the novel in the United States, and ship the overrun to England for binding and publication there. Chapman's red-ink revisions appear on nearly every page of the typescript and include a multiplicity of spelling corrections, frequent substitutions of words and phrases, and deletions of sentences, paragraphs, and series of paragraphs. Having "corrected" a correctly spelled word on the typescript, he noted in the margin (499): "See what a pass your typist has brought me to!" A great number of passages in the script are enclosed in square brackets, "passages," wrote Chapman on 15 July, "that I suggest you should cut out altogether." Chapman wished that he could have marked additional passages for deletion, but it is very difficult to know (for anyone except the author of the book) whether an apparent irrelevancy has any bearing on subsequent events. Your principal failing . . . is a tendency to deal too elaborately with entirely subsidiary characters. . . . The pictures . . . display your complete realization of your various individuals. But they are out of scale. And so they distract attention temporarily, and to no useful end, from the important characters. Key objects of Chapman's pruning included Dreiser's authorial rumination and interpretation. He pared such passages so that in given instances characters' words and actions must speak for themselves. Sometimes Chapman merely subtracted a useless sentence like "A chronicle of Eugene's experiences here would make a book in itself, interesting and valuable, though they would have little place in this story" (553). Often, it seems, he was carrying out the aim stated in his letter: reducing Dreiser's "too elaborate" presentation of peripheral characters, as in a description of Loomis Cathcart (1084). "What's Hecuba to me?" Chapman jotted in the margin. Often, too, his suggested deletions involve development of main characters, as in the bracketing of a passage that portrays Angela's refusal to let Witla forget his infidelities (809). Deletion of the latter point seems aimed at an Angela with whom the reader can more readily sympathize and, by the same token, deprives Witla of one of the irritants that underlay his growing resentment at her need to control him. A further consequence is that Witla's words to Angela upon learning of her pregnancy seem doubly cruel. In a few instances, Chapman's recommended cut was dictated by his sense of propriety: "Cut this: It would offend thousands," he commented in the margin next to a description of "the great wooden cross" with "the bleeding Christ" hanging in Witla's studio (811). But Dreiser retained this object d'art. Wherever feasible, Chapman "eliminated the word 'sex', with which your story is positively peppered." In sum, Chapman's deletions totaled slightly more than one third of the alleged 50,000 words. 47 Chapman's wide vocabulary was of special service in revision. 48 He corrected, for example, the malapropos "retroactive" to "retrogressive." He substituted "basis of suspicion" for "basis of proof," "on probation" for "probationally," and hundreds more. As with the word "sex," he sought to reduce the number of occurrences of the words "conservative" and "conservatism," replacing them with "quiet," "prudent," "cautious," and other equivalents. He pressed for consistency: M. or Mr. Charles. He rectified Dreiser's attempt at quoting Hamlet and his misattribution to Keats of a line of Longfellow's. He futilely offered the emendation Anadyomene, a title for Venus, for Dreiser's fabricated Dianeme, which found its way into the published text. He called for the active voice of the verb rather than the passive. Of Dreiser's "Rossetti Gallery" and reference to Rossetti's portraits of Elizabeth Siddal, he cautioned: "There is not and never has been such a place , or even a private collection that could be so styled. And Rossetti's portraits and studies of Elizabeth Siddal numbered nearer the hundred than the score." In addition, Chapman recast passages in the typescript. 49 A single example must serve to represent several instances. Dreiser's "For one thing Mrs. Hibberdell had been more and more impressed with the fact that Carlotta was not only interested or content to stay all summer but once having come that she was fairly determined to remain" became ". . . the fact that Carlotta was not merely content to stay but once having come she was fairly determined to remain." By these and other alterations, Chapman sometimes supplied a smoother texture to Dreiser's prose. In the letter of 8 July, Chapman acknowledged that as John Lane's reader this was his role. Chapman's massive cutting of passages of authorial comment and explanation as well as of some facets of character depiction also made a contribution to the final shape of the novel. Chapman appreciated the validity of Dreiser's need to document event and character with a full measure of supporting details. He succeeded in understanding Dreiser's concern to present clearly even the most subsidiary characters, but urged greater selectivity. Following publication of The "Genius" , he paid Dreiser the compliment, "You could teach most of your contemporaries to observe, to co-ordinate, and to deduce" (1 March 1916, UPDC). The next revisor was Floyd Dell, but only after he had undergone a change of heart regarding The "Genius" . Having had access to the 1911 typescript of the novel subsequently lost in the mail, Dell asserted early in 1913 that Dreiser had "written a very bad book" (undated, UPDC). He at that time admitted, however, that his opinion "was formed upon only part of the book," which he had not had the "chance to finish," and that his estimate might change after a complete reading. But in 1913, this was Dell's judgment: . . . no amount of cutting could improve it—it would have to be rewritten from first to last. I do not think its erotic aspects count against it. . . . But there is passage after passage, incident after incident, in which you have got everything but the soul of the action—something I have never known you before to miss. Still, Dell did not doubt that Dreiser had "a story to tell . . . which would move me." I can see how a change of half a dozen lines in a couple of pages would turn the scene of Witla's first home coming (for instance) into a real thing . . . and a reworking of the whole book (with liberal cuts) would presumably turn it into a fine thing. Dell, who in the fall of 1913 had moved to Greenwich Village, had by then "warmed up to the story." 50 When Chapman had returned the full typescript to Dreiser in July of 1915, Dell next set to work to "turn it into a fine thing." Dell embroidered the facts, however, when he later wrote about his role in editing The "Genius" , for which Dreiser had "hired" him: I would take a large hunk of that mountainous manuscript, and go through it, crossing out with a light lead pencil such sentences, paragraphs and pages as I thought could be spared; and when I returned for more, there sat Dreiser, with a large eraser, rescuing from oblivion such pages, paragraphs and sentences as he felt could not be spared. ( Homecoming 269) Dell's principal contribution, it is true, consisted in cutting and reshaping passages with the aim of giving the story, written by Dreiser in a spontaneous flow, more exact meaning and more graceful form. Dell seconded most of Chapman's suggested deletions, sometimes adding a paragraph for removal, but here and there Dell retrieved one of Chapman's bracketed passages. Dell's editing for economy occurs on the majority of pages of the typescript. For example, he revised the following: Although in the main [fame] has no substance outside of envy and all uncharitableness, it is yet the lure, the ignus [ sic ] fatuus. . . . Then and then only the substance and not the shadow of fame is truly known—those deep, beautiful illusions . . . [382] to It is yet the lure, the ignus fatuus. . . . Then most of all does there seem substantial reality in the shadow of fame—those deep, beautiful illusions. . . . This instance can serve to represent many. A rewritten passage contrasting Witla's and Angela's outlooks appears in Dell's handwriting (420 and 428-430). Following Chapman's suggestion at the beginning of Chapter 37, Dell excised four paragraphs. The first consists in an explanation that human society, having left behind the instinctual "morality" of beasts, has entered upon a path of sexual indulgence while opposing any open discussion of sex. In the second, faced with contrasting views of matrimony—from sexual athleticism to the Christian Science emphasis on spirit, Witla estimates that sexual license is within the limits of his strength, in keeping with the principle of self-preservation. In the third, Witla admits, however, that there is a case for chastity and for exclusively reproductive use of sex. In the fourth, observing that chastity is a cardinal point urged by great religious teachers and lust and adultery condemned as a root of sickness that besets body as well as soul, the fatalistic Witla can nonetheless see no possibility of his observing the injunction against license. In addition to the four paragraphs bracketed by Chapman, Dell cut out the fifth paragraph, which treats sustained intense sexual activity of Witla and his wife, a passage which Chapman had extensively revised and which Dreiser ultimately used elsewhere in the novel. Taking exception to Chapman, Dell deleted the sentence "It would be useless to describe the details and difficulties of a persistent decline" (461) and restored the preceding five paragraphs, removed by Chapman, who relied on the sentence Dell deleted as a substitute for tracing Witla's decline. On more than one occasion Dell advised Dreiser on resolving questions noted by Chapman in the margins. Beside Chapman's "'It's all day with the Wickham Union': idiom that hardly explains itself" (689), Dell jotted, "'All day' was succeeded in US by 'good night!'—meaning done for, dismissed!" Beside Angela's "'I won't let you marry her'" (1106), Chapman had written, "But how could she? . . . or is 'marry' her euphemism for 'live together'?" Dell modified the line to read "'I won't let you have her.'" Beside "She could get no line on his temperament now" (1173), Chapman had noted, "Meaningless to an Englishman, and I can't hit on a substitute." Dell revised the line to "She could get no clue to his temperament now." To a great extent Dell's revisory role paralleled that of Chapman. But, whereas the latter concentrated on deleting what he judged ineffective passages and on substituting a more serviceable diction, Dell did not hesitate to alter structural elements. "When at one spot," Dell recalled, "I complained that a short passage was needed for structural reasons, [Dreiser] said with gigantic tolerance, 'Well, if you think it's needed, go ahead and put it in.' I was being paid, so I . . . put it in" ( Homecoming 269). Since the bulk of Dell's deletions consisted of paragraphs already marked for removal by Chapman, their combined cutting included, by my extrapolation, little more than 20,000 words. The nature of Dell's and of Chapman's revisions and Dreiser's cooperation with each calls into question the claim that though Dreiser "often allowed others to edit the style of his books, he fought bitterly when their content was questioned." 51 As Helen Dreiser observed, Dreiser welcomed a fresh eye on work he had completed and, from wide experience as an editor, realized the value of reworking one's prose. Though Mencken had offered suggestions that he believed might improve The "Genius" , Dreiser had declined to accept them and inscribed the presentation copy, "Without change but with best wishes just the same." 52 In contrast, Dreiser abided by almost every cut suggested either by Chapman or by Dell along with most of their other editing, as comparison of the revised typescript with the galleys makes clear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Final Revision The typescript as revised first by Dreiser, then by Chapman, next by Dell, and again, finally, by Dreiser was not the setting copy for the galleys. Although Dreiser marked this typescript as that "from which [the] first edition was printed," it could not have been the setting copy: it bears no telltale signs—no typesetter's markings, no inky fingerprints, no spike-holes, no printer's notation of galley takes, no notations by the copy-editor and the compositor. How galleys were prepared thus poses a mystery. The galleys themselves display a few minor alterations beyond the revisions of the typescript. The galleys do not, however, present the final form of the novel. Comparison of the text of the galleys with that of the published edition shows that considerable revision was introduced after the galleys had been printed, introduced perhaps into printer's proof sheets which must have been destroyed by the John Lane Company after the final typesetting had been completed. Since there are no page proofs of The "Genius" in Pennsylvania's Dreiser Collection and since the extant galley sheets bear no trace of editing, little can be inferred about the circumstances of final revision. No evidence tells us who made the cuts or why they were made. The change instantly seen in the published novel is replacement of one sequence of chapters numbered without a break from 1 through 104 with a postscript ("L'Envoi") in the holograph and through 105 with "L'Envoi" in the typescript and in the galleys. The published text is divided into three parts with a total of 91 chapters: Book I, "Youth," Chapters I through XXVIII; Book II, "Struggle," I through XLIV; and Book III, "Revolt," I through XXIX and "L'Envoi." The decision must have been made after scrutiny of the galleys to fix the format of page proofs in three books, perhaps, as Pizer offers, "in order to divide a very long novel into shorter parts" ( Novels 136), perhaps on advice of an editor habituated to English novels in three volumes. In addition, one finds in the published text alteration in some chapter units, usually a combining of two chapters into one, an instance of which is noted in the following paragraph. Shortening constitutes the pervasive difference between the published version and the galleys—the deletion of sentences, paragraphs, and even larger portions further accounting for the disparity in length between the holograph of, by Dreiser's count, 425,000 words and the published book of 350,000 words. Omitted from Book 2, Chapter 4, for example, are two paragraphs from the galleys which present Angela's reflection on obstacles to fidelity for husbands (Chapter 32 of the galleys) as well as one paragraph conveying her absolute trust in Witla's estimate of the National Academy, which she hopes will recognize him. Book 2, Chapter 11, omits a paragraph on Angela's feeling that Witla does not love her and also her process of educating him in matters of dress and social conduct (galleys Chapter 40). Book 2, Chapter 14, omits a passage expressing Angela's remembrances of Witla courting her grandly and her determination not to share him with other women (galleys Chapter 42). These deletions seem representative of an effort to eliminate details in the characterization of Angela and of lesser characters, perhaps for increased emphasis on what is retained. But some passages portraying Witla's own experience were also judged expendable. From Book 2, Chapter 6, for example, eleven and a half paragraphs are omitted. They present Witla's excitement at receiving a letter from M. Charles and Witla's visit with Smite and McHugh, from whom he secured assurances that an exhibition at Kellner's would establish him in the art world and from whom he accepted advice to do less illustrating and more serious painting (galleys Chapter 34). Book 2, Chapter 9, omits a lengthy passage which traces Witla and Angela's period of adjustment in their Washington Square days (galleys Chapters 37 and 38). Like other passages cut in the final revision, this excised section sometimes underscores points already made clear in the story. Omitted from Book 2, Chapter 15, are three paragraphs which communicate Witla's trapped feeling in marriage to a wife who shares the conventional idea of a husband as property (galleys Chapter 43). Book 2, Chapter 41, omits fifteen such paragraphs. These treat the Witlas' social connections in Philadelphia, Eugene's enhanced reputation in holding a position with the Kalvin Company, his help to struggling artists despite efforts by his staff to ward off appeals, the development of his business personality together with his progressive views toward social reform, Angela's failure to broaden her outlook, their private quarrels at the same time that they give a public impression of being the ideal couple, and Witla's dreams of freedom from the burden of marriage. Finally, such extensive cutting seems a stunting of the action and character of Dreiser's protagonist. Yet deletions from the galleys are much less extensive than those made in the revised typescript. The final result is not an art of conciseness and suggestion, however; it retains Dreiser's distinctive demonstrative and cumulative style held in closer limits. Attempting to explain his art of fiction, Dreiser stated that "creative writing has more to do with emotion than any other single factor": "Generalized and intensified feeling for life is what is expressed." 53 He added: When a writer traces the course of a complete emotional cycle, what you might call a selected causal chain, . . . he has his work laid out, and the name by which it is called, novel, short story, play or poem, or whatever, really comes after the fact. It is the amount of material which is involved in the feeling which determines the form of the work. His words point in elliptical fashion to his own initial experience prompting creation of a novel. Key stages in the process of construction include drafts and multiple reworking by the author, sometimes after fallow periods of concentration on matters other than the novel, prepublication critiques by respected acquaintances leading to modification of plot, and revisions by writers and editors other than the author as well as his own. The present paper has attempted to trace these stages in the evolution of The "Genius" toward its final form and meaning.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Watermarks and the Dating of Old Russian Manuscripts: The Case of Poslanie Mnogoslovnoe by Nancy Yanoshak *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poslanie mnogoslovnoe is an anonymous and undated polemic traditionally attributed to the sixteenth century Novgorodian monk Zinovii Otenskii. 1 In conjunction with Zinovii's magnum opus, Istiny pokazanie, Poslanie provides our chief source of information about Feodosii Kosoi, long considered the principal representative of the Radical Reformation in Russia. 2 Elsewhere I have shown how the watermarks 3 in the manuscript copies of compositions ascribed to Zinovii help to solve a number of questions about the origins of those documents, to establish that Poslanie should not be included among Zinovii's writings, and to lay the basis for a revised interpretation of both him and his heretical opponents. 4 Using filigranological and other evidence, I was able not only to identify the oldest extant manuscript of Poslanie , K-B 31, 5 as an autograph text (of its still unknown author), 6 but also to estimate its date as 1567, a time that coincides with a 1565 terminus post quem suggested by the text itself. 7 In the following discussion I will extend this analysis by attempting to determine when the paper varieties found in K-B 31 were used. Though the results are of immediate consequence for Poslanie itself, the methodology of this consideration of runs and remnants may also be of wider bibliographical use. Few students of paper would fail to acknowledge that the mere identification of a watermark with one from an album reprinting handmade tracings from dated manuscripts is virtually useless for dating purposes, since such a procedure can hardly establish "identity" of the mark in question with the original. 8 However, even when a mark has been correctly matched with a dated analogue, there still remains the problem of ascertaining how long before or after the latter the paper containing the former was used. One of the more notable attempts to devise a method of dating watermarks which deals with this difficulty was made by the celebrated pioneer of watermark study, Charles M. Briquet. In his most famous work, Les Filigranes , Briquet endeavored to ascertain the amount of time that could elapse between the production and use of the paper made during the thirteenth- through sixteenth-century period covered in this album. Only in rare cases during this era did watermarks themselves directly indicate when they were made. But, Briquet inferred, because the wire designs that produced them deteriorated rather quickly, identical filigranes must have been made virtually at the same time. Thus, finding them in documents dated a number of years apart will give an indication of the time lag between their fabrication and employment in manuscripts and books, the assumption presumably being that the earlier date represents paper used immediately, and the later, the time limit within which the stock of paper in question can be expected to be found in use (Briquet, Les Filigranes , vol. 1, pp. xviii-xx). On these principles Briquet calculated the use-period of 2558 marks and their identical dated variants covering a period from the late thirteenth through the late sixteenth centuries, and found that for virtually all of the cases considered, the maximum time-span was fifteen years or less. 9 A work containing a watermark identical to that in a dated document could thus be assumed to have been produced fifteen years before or after the dated work (i.e. since it would not be known whether the dated document represents the paper at the beginning or end of its use-period). This thirty year period could be reduced if the undated document contained a number of marks which could be matched with those in dated works, since in this case the various use-periods would mutually limit each other (Briquet, Les Filigranes , vol. 1, pp. xx-xxiii). In 1920 the noted Russian paleographer V. N. Shchepkin produced a critique of Briquet's method, and an approach to dating watermarks which he thought yielded a narrower time-period. Shchepkin suggested that the use of the maximum of plus/minus fifteen years as a corrective is unsatisfactory, since in more than half of the cases Briquet himself considered, the production/use timelag was five years or less, while the average figure was a decade. 10 Moreover, Briquet limited himself to a comparison only of identical marks, which Shchepkin implied did not take sufficient account of the fact that watermarks do change in shape very quickly during the short life of their wire designs. Thus, apparently working on the assumption that "very similar" as well as "identical" marks were produced at nearly the same point in time, Shchepkin devised a dating formula designed to be accurate to within a decade, based on a comparison of the use dates of both the former and the latter. What Shchepkin sought to obtain was the average of the known use dates of a given mark, which were then corrected by a margin of error assumed to be plus/minus five years. For a manuscript with one watermark, a simple average would be sufficient; for a work containing several different marks with various use dates, the average taken is that between the use dates of the two chronologically closest marks (since the various use dates again would mutually limit each other). 11 Shchepkin's critique of Briquet's method is well-founded, and although his own procedure was expressed somewhat ambiguously, 12 his approach might seem a serviceable guideline for the calculation of an approximate watermark date. 13 However, both Shchepkin and Briquet seem to have been insufficiently aware of certain peculiarities of watermarks and their behavior which can have an important bearing on the use of watermark evidence in dating a manuscript. These factors can best be explained in terms of the way they have been studied by Allan Stevenson, who has been perhaps the most outstanding student of paper as bibliographical evidence to have written in recent decades. 14 One major implication of Stevenson's research has been that watermarks do not have to be "identical" or even "very similar" in order to have been produced virtually at the same time, and he has pointed out a number of ways by which the researcher can determine the nature of the chronological relationship with which he or she is dealing. Stevenson seems to have been the first scholar to analyze the implications of the fact that watermarks are "twins." That is, pairs of wire forms with essentially the same designs were used to speed up the paper-making process, and the duplicate marks that result can be found together, thus denoting one consistent stock of paper. These twins would never be fully identical to each other, but will nevertheless be exact contemporaries with regard to time of manufacture. 15 Moreover, using guidelines which Stevenson has provided on certain recurring variations displayed by twin marks, the researcher can distinguish these pairs from other marks which may also appear very similar (perhaps having been produced by the same artisan), but of a different age (Stevenson, "Twins," pp. 64-68). Relatedly, Stevenson has shown that the distortion which watermarks undergo as their wire designs are used is a regular and in part measurable process, so that earlier and later stages or "states" in their brief lives can be distinguished. 16 Thus again, filigranes which might once have seemed only typologically related will be identifiable as different states of the same mark, very close to each other in age. Briquet was clearly aware that double moulds were used in paper production, Shchepkin at least recognized generally that more than one "form" could be employed in making the same kind of paper, and both knew that the marks changed shape during the lives of their moulds. 17 However, neither studied these phenomena systematically, or really took account of them in their dating formulae, which were applied only to "identical" or "very similar" marks. Thus many filigranes intimately related to each other, the analysis of which could clearly have a bearing on the dating of the paper stocks, and hence of the works in which they appear, would be ignored by such formulae. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the ability to identify twins and their variant states is that it facilitates the recognition of the presence of long series or "runs" of contemporaneously produced marks, which Stevenson considers to be the most significant for dating purposes. What Stevenson essentially argues is that these substantial runs denote a stock or stocks of paper procured expressly for a specific major project, which thus can be assumed to have been used shortly after their purchase. 18 Stevenson's research on early European printed books amply demonstrates a correlation between dating and the presence of long runs of homogeneous paper, and the idea is reenforced by the fact that paper was expensive to produce, which, as Stevenson points out, meant that a manufacturer did not undertake to make a large stock of paper until he had a definite order for it. 19 Thus one inference which might be drawn from all of this is that paper in a substantial run in an undated work could be presumed to have been used at about the same time as it was in a dated volume, where it also constituted a major stock. Concomitantly, Stevenson also noted other types of paper use, such as those represented by personal documents, or single sheets found scattered in large volumes, both of which may have remained in use for a number of years. That is, since paper was expensive to purchase as well as to produce, extra sheets left over from any project would be likely to be saved, rather than discarded. Stevenson suggested for example that a small but costly stock of paper might be passed from father to son, which could explain those exceptional cases noted by Briquet of the same mark turning up twenty or thirty years after its first recorded appearance. 20 Perhaps more importantly, Stevenson's research again demonstrates that odd sheets in the middle of large volumes tend to be left-overs or "remnants" of earlier projects, used where needed to fill gaps in later tasks. 21 Thus the dating of the major stock or stocks of paper represented by long "runs" should not be influenced by the long use-period which might obtain for "remnant" sheets scattered among its leaves; the former can be presumed to have been used as they were procured, and dating calculations, such as those of Briquet or Shchepkin, which have given equal weight to runs and remnants must of necessity have been distorted. Stevenson was concerned primarily with western and central European printed books, and his approach implied that virtually no time-corrective was needed if one were dealing with considerable amounts of homogeneous paper in a large volume, whose remnants were essentially irrelevant for dating purposes. However, in applying these ideas to dating manuscripts, especially those produced on paper imported into Rus', where conditions affecting the paper trade are still inadequately known, it would seem unwise to apply no corrective at all to a suggested use date. Thus I would propose the creation of an additional category of paper use, interspersed between those suggested in Stevenson's work, which would apply to long manuscripts characterized by substantial runs, but also containing remnant sheets. Because paper even in a lengthy manuscript constitutes a smaller sample of the evidence involved (i.e. the stock of paper it represents) than does a printed book existing in a number of exemplars, its odd sheets may not be as insignificant for analysis as they would be in the printed work. Thus, while the long runs in such a volume will still be given prime consideration, as Stevenson suggests, the evidence provided by its remnants will not be entirely disregarded. Rather they will be used as a check on the date indicated by the main stock of paper, which is when that particular document was putatively inscribed. When the use dates of these remnants do not coincide with the date of the latter, they should, again following Stevenson, be presumed to be at the end of their use periods. Thus adding the latter figure (five years or less for the majority of marks in Briquet's sample) to their use dates should produce a limit beyond which that particular manuscript could not have first appeared. 22 Conversely, if the remnants do have use dates later than the major stock, the date of the latter might reasonably be called into question. In this way, the testimony of the remnants would be utilized, but would not disproportionately influence the choice of the dating period for a given stock of paper. The most significant watermark match-ups in K-B 31 are with filigranes found in two other Russian works both written in 1567: Muzeiskoe 4056, a Mineia chetiia ("Reading Menology"), 23 and OIDR 328, a Triod tsvetnaia (a service book for fast days from Easter until Pentecost). 24 Before turning to the specifics of my analysis, a word of caution is in order: While in the Soviet Union in 1977-1978 I was able to make a first-hand inspection of all three of these manuscripts (i.e. K-B 31, Muzeiskoe 4056, and OIDR 328), but was given time only for a hurried examination of the latter two, and was not permitted to trace any of the marks involved. Thus my findings cannot be considered conclusive until they are verified by some more accurate means of reproduction and comparison than the fallible human hand and eye. K-B 31 contains sixteen watermarks—ten "gloves" and six "spheres" of varying shapes and sizes, which together appear a total of seventy-one times, throughout the manuscript's 290 folios. 25 All of these marks will be shown to date from the 1560s, and all, with one possible exception, can be found in manuscripts of Russian provenance written during this decade. The filigranes which are found most often in K-B 31 are two small ruffled gloves, each topped by a crown, with a letter "F" on the palm, and corresponding to Likhachev's nos. 1878 (in very good/excellent likenesses and distorted variants or later states), and 1879 (in good/excellent likenesses and close variants, perhaps later states). 26 They occur in twenty-four of the thirty odd quires of the manuscript, and together account for more than half of the total number of its marks. Their design features, frequency, and distribution suggest that they might be twins, but even taken separately, they stil constitute the longest runs of homogeneous paper in the work. 27 The second longest run in K-B 31 is represented also by two gloves—these topped by a star and marked with the letter "B" on the palm. They correspond to Likhachev 1901 (excellent likenesses) and 1902 (good/very good likenesses), and may also be companion marks, as each is found six times distributed in six consecutive quires, in four of which they occur as matched pairs. 28 The originals of 1878 and 1879 are found in Muzeiskoe 4056, where they are not the most frequently occurring marks, but still do appear a significant number of times in both earlier and later states, and again are distributed in relatively short runs in a frequency which implies that they might be twins. 29 Significantly, there are runs of 1878 and 1879 in later, but still recognizable states, and still behaving as twins, in OIDR 328, from which 1901 and 1902 are taken (viewed as twins, the latter two marks also constitute runs in this manuscript). This is something which Likhachev failed to note, despite the fact that in OIDR 328, 1878 and 1879 are among the more frequently occurring marks. 30 Next in frequency in K-B 31 is still another crowned glove, which is a fairly close variant of Likhachev 1872, and is again taken from Muzeiskoe 4056. It appears three times in K-B 31 (see Table 1). The rest of the marks in the manuscript occur only once or twice each, and ought clearly to be classified as remnants. As has been indicated, such sheets should not unduly influence the choice of a date for the main stocks of paper, but nevertheless it could be noted that these remnants support the suggested 1567 date for K-B 31. Five of them do so more or less directly in that they match two spheres from Muzeiskoe 4056 and one glove which may also appear in that manuscript (good likeness of Likhachev 1892; fairly close variant of 1888; close variant of 3356), 31 and two gloves from OIDR 328 (good/excellent likeness of Likhachev 1905; very close variant of 1907). 32 A third sphere is at least typologically related to one (Likhachev 1920) in another Russian work dated 1567. 33 The remaining five remnants can be matched with marks in documents dated before 1567, and thus if we assume that, like most remnants, they represent marks nearing the end of their use-periods, again they would not contradict the 1567 date implied by the main stock of paper. Naturally most significant here are the two marks in this "non-1567" group which could be identified with any certainty: a glove which is a good/very good likeness of Likhachev 3146, 34 and a sphere which is a fairly good likeness of Likhachev 1856 or close variant of Likhachev 4090 (these may be variants of the same mark). The earliest use-dates which could be found for these marks are 1562 and 1561/1562 respectively, 35 which, corrected by the most common use-time limit, produces a terminus of 1567. The remaining three "non-1567" marks are in states difficult to match with any found in watermark albums, and thus are all but useless for dating purposes. However, the data they do provide again can be seen as support (at least indirectly) for the 1567 dating of K-B 31. They all resemble marks in use in the 1560s, none of which dates beyond that year. Meanwhile the earliest filigrane which any of them vaguely resembles is dated 1560. 36 Thus, finding such a mark in a later state in a manuscript written near the end of the decade (i.e. K-B 31) would imply a perfectly acceptable seven year use-period. Thus it would seem that the available data clearly and consistently supports the idea that K-B 31 was inscribed in 1567 or very close to that date, and that the principle that a manuscript may be dated by its main stock of paper, using remnants as a check on the date of the latter, is valid, at least in this one case. Not only do all of the marks in the manuscript have analogues dating to the 1560s, but eleven of them, including both runs and remnants, can be identified with marks in Russian works dated 1567. Moreover, at least nine of the latter, which account for 88.7% of the total number of filigranes in K-B 31, closely match marks found in either Muzeiskoe 4056 or OIDR 328. Furthermore, these two manuscripts both contain significant runs of Likhachev 1878 and 1879, which undoubtedly constitute the longest runs in K-B 31. 37 The remaining five marks are all themselves remnants with use dates in the early 1560s, and thus likewise do not contradict the 1567 date posited for K-B 31. Clearly one reason that the dating procedure suggested here could be applied to K-B 31 is that all but one of the dated analogues of its marks were on manuscripts of Russian provenance; thus an allowance for "travel-time" for the importation of its paper into Muscovy did not have to enter into the calculation. There are of course other aspects of paper-use and watermark behavior which need further study before this approach can be adopted with any confidence. For example, "runs" and "remnants" are still relative terms, at least with regard to manuscripts, which, as noted, represent a much smaller sample of a given stock of paper than can be accounted for in several exemplars of the same printed book. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the basic idea of dating manuscripts by their main stock and checking that date by their remnants, is worth the testing and refinement it requires, and I hope that the conclusions presented here will provide the impetus for such further work to be done. Table 1 Distribution of Watermarks in K-B 31 The gatherings signed with a Cyrillic letter are here designated as gatherings 1-33, those not included in that count as A-D, and folios lacking both text and numeration as ff. 01-010. Three leaves are foliated with Roman numerals (f. I is attached to the front cover of the manuscript), and the leaves in the gatherings here designated B through 33 are paginated 1-277 in Arabic numbers. Watermark designs are cited according to their entry numbers in Likhachev's Paleograficheskoe znachenie or (when preceeded by "B") Briquet's Les Filigranes . The references for possible dated variants are recorded in parentheses; alternate identifications of a mark are separated by a virgule. References for marks that appear a second time in the same quire are followed by a parenthetical "2." The manuscript contains 71 watermarks, 63 of which imply a use date of 1567.

When reference is made to parts of Briquet's and Likhachev's albums other than their watermark reproductions, the author's name, short title, and appropriate volume and page numbers are given. 4 For surveys of the scholarly literature on Kosoi and other figures in the Russian "Reformation movements" of the mid-sixteenth century, see Kalugin, Zinovii , pp. 44-52, and Zimin, Peresvetov , pp. 143-153. The principal implications of my research are that Kosoi was more conservative theologically than has previously been thought—he did not question the fundamental dogmas of Christianity, as charged in Istiny —but did adhere to the pacifist and communist social-political views ascribed to him in Poslanie ; that Zinovii was a trusted contributor to the Orthodox anti-heretical campaigns of his time, while the Poslanie author was a suspect one from the point of view of the established church; and that neither of these clerics can be linked clearly to an identifiable party of followers of Iosif Volotskii, the chief ideologist of Muscovy's "church militant." Among other things, watermark analysis helped me to identify the autograph copies of Istiny and Poslanie , sort out the relationships between the constituent parts of the latter, and establish an accurate date for its composition, information which formed the basis of the interpretive conclusions outlined above. For further information, see my "The Author of Poslanie mnogoslovnoe : A Fontological Inquiry," Slavic Review , 50, no. 3 (Fall, 1991), 621-636, and idem, "Zinovii." 5 My abbreviation for Gosudarstvennaia ordena Trudovo Krasnogo Znameni Publichnaia biblioteka imeni M. E. Saltykova Shchedrina (Leningrad) (GPB), Sobranie Kirillo-Belozerskogo monastyria No. 31/1108 (4°, 277 fols. of text, 12 blank fols.), which was the basis of the published version of Poslanie . Only one other copy of the manuscript is extant (GPB, Novgorod-Sofiiskoe sobranie No. 1241, 4°, 258 fols.). It was made in the nineteenth century from the K-B 31 copy. 6 My arguments on the question of whether K-B 31 is an autograph text are summarized in Yanoshak, "The Author of Poslanie mnogoslovnoe ," and presented in detail in idem, "Zinovii," 133-178. 7 The 1565 terminus post quem for Poslanie is provided by its reference (PM, p. 238) to the existence of a homily attributed to Zinovii on St. Nikita of Novgorod. The evidence for its 1565 date was convincingly analysed by Kalugin, who coordinated information it contained on the timing of St. Nikita's Day, St. Thomas' Week, and the Easter celebration (GPB, Sofiiskoe 1356, fols. 307-308) with the dates given for these holidays in a sixteenth-century Paschal table ( Zinovii , pp. 321-322, 22 n.16; on the manuscript tradition of this as yet unpublished homily, and its relationship to Poslanie and Zinovii's works, and to other versions of Nikita's Life, see Yanoshak, "Zinovi," pp. 217-265.) 8 The inadequacies of identification made by matching a given mark with a reproduction of a hand tracing are fairly obvious: the original tracings themselves are products of the fallible human hand and eye, vary much in quality, and their common form of album reproduction is itself a further distortion. On these weaknesses of tracings and the desirability of more accurate methods of reproduction, see Allan Stevenson, The Problem of the Missale Speciale , London, 1967, pp. 65-68, and the same author's introduction to Charles M. Briquet, The New Briquet. Jubilee Edition , 4 vols., Geneva, 1907; reprint of Les Filigranes with supplementary materials, Amsterdam, 1968, vol. 1, p. * 17; see also Daniel C. Waugh, "Soviet Watermark Studies—Achievements and Prospects," Kritika , vol. 6, 1970, pp. 91-92, 109. The most promising method of reproducing watermarks developed thus far is by betaradiography, which produces an image virtually free of distortion, and is superior to ordinary photographic methods in that it eliminates the lines of script or type which have obscured details of the watermarks reproduced by such older procedures. 9 Ibid., pp. xix-xx. Briquet's figuring produced approximately the same results for each century. For paper of "ordinary" size format (i.e. paper measuring 35cm x 50cm or less—by far the most common in use), the maximum use-period of approximately 55% of the marks for all three centuries combined, was one to five years; for approximately 25%, it was six to ten years; and for approximately 10%, eleven to fifteen years. For the sixteenth century, the time-frame most pertinent to the analysis in this article, the figures were 55% (one to five years) and 24% (six to ten). For paper of the rare large-size format, the useperiod might be as long as thirty years. 10 V. N.

Shchepkina; rpt. of 1920 edition entitled Uchebnik Russkoi paleografii , p. 203. This piece was also published as a separate article: V. N. Shchepkin and M. V. Shchepkina, "Paleogra-ficheskoe znachenie vodianykh znakov" Problemy istochnikovedeniia , vol. 6, 1958, pp. 325-346. My citations are from the essay as appended to Russkaia paleografiia . 11 Shchepkin, Paleografiia , pp. 205-207, 209. Shchepkin expressed his approach in the formula X = M ± 5: where X equals the sought-for time period in the undated manuscript, and M equals the mean in years between the use-dates of its watermarks. For an undated manuscript with several marks, the procedure for finding M apparently would be to locate the two chronologically closest marks and calculate the mean between the use dates for each mark that, when paired, encompass the shortest period of time (M = D + D1 divided by 2). Shchepkin's choice of a decade as a corrective for his average use-date seems to be based in part on the observations of his Russian predecessors in the study of watermarks, the Muscovite engraver K. Ia. Tromonin, and the historian, paleographer, and archaeologist, N. P. Likhachev. The former suggested that for foreign paper used in Russian manuscripts, a decade should be added to the use-date; the latter argued that there were too many variables to justify a correction in the case of a single mark appearing in a manuscript, but that for manuscripts with many marks, the use-dates would mutually limit each other, which could produce a date accurate to within a decade (Shchepkin, Paleografiia , pp. 203, 206, 207). Shchepkin also produced a limited sample comparing marks that indicated their manufacture dates with their use dates for the end of the sixteenth/beginning of the seventeenth centuries, which indicated an average of twelve and one-half years for the use of foreign paper in Russia, and he suggested that further research might narrow this average to a decade (ibid., p. 205). Additionally, Shchepkin noted that even one of Briquet's examples of dating a manuscript with several marks with his mutually limiting fifteen-year corrections resulted in a dating period spanning a decade (ibid., p. 208). And finally it may be inferred that Shchepkin was also influenced by his interpretation of Briquet's statistics of paper use through the sixteenth century, which indicated that only rarely did the production/use-time lag extend beyond a decade (ibid., pp. 206, 202-203). The percentage figures Shchepkin derives from Briquet's statistics are not quite accurate, but his principle of a ten-year corrective is supported when they are corrected: 79.9% of all the marks Briquet considered were used within this time period. (See Les Filigranes , vol. 1, p. xx.) Tromonin's work was published in 1844 as Iz"iasnenie znakov, vidimykh v pischei bumage, posredstvom kotrykh mozhno uznavat' kogda napisany ili napechatany kakii libo knigi, grammaty, risunki, kartinki i drugiia starinnyia i nestarinnyia dela, na kotorykh ne oznacheno godov . Moscow; reissued in facsimilie, with supplementary materials by S. A. Klepikov, as Tromonin's Watermark Album , Monumenta Chartae Papyraceae Historiam Illustrantia, vol. 11, Hilversum, Holland, 1965. 12 See for example, Paleografiia , p. 209, where Shchepkin explains the choice of watermark dates to be used in applying his formula to the dating of one of the manuscripts Briquet had attempted unsuccessfully to date by his own method. 13 Waugh recommends Shchepkin's essay as a "useful appendix on dating by means of watermarks" ("Watermark studies," p. 78 n. 3). Additionally, Waugh says he assumes a potential error in dating of at least plus/minus five years, where he has identified a mark with one in an album, although he does not seem to employ any specifically formulated dating procedure. ( "De Visu Description of Manuscripts Containing the Correspondence," in Edward L. Keenan, The Kurbskii-Groznyi Apocrypha: The Seventeenth Century Genesis of the 'Correspondence' Attributed to Prince A. M. Kurbskii and Tsar Ivan IV , Cambridge, Mass., 1971, pp. 103-104; cf. idem., The Great Turkes Defiance: On the History of the Apocryphal Correspondence of the Ottoman Sultan in its Muscovite and Russian Variants , Columbus, Ohio, 1978, pp. 222-223, where Dr. Waugh takes a somewhat more agnostic position on the time corrective that ought to be applied). 14 Perhaps Stevenson's most spectacular achievement in the use of watermark study to solve bibliographic problems is his analysis of the Missale Speciale , considered by a number of scholars as being possibly the oldest western printed book in existence, i.e. dating from the early 1450s. Using watermarks, typographical evidence, and other bibliographical features, Stevenson demonstrated that the book should actually be dated to 1473; in the course of his research he located the city in which it was printed (Basle), identified the names of its likely printers, and narrowed the printing date to July-August 23, 1473. (On the dating of the work, see Missale , p. 166; on its printers, see Chapter 10, especially p. 222.) 15 Allan H.

See also Likhachev, Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, pp. LXXIV-LXXVI on the use of paper in Muscovy. Only rarely, in Likhachev's opinion, could a manuscript be finished without the purchase of a stock of paper. 19 On Stevenson's evidence that paper in long runs was procured for a specific task, implying an immediate or shorter use-period, see Missale , chapter 6; on the operations involved in early European papermaking, and on some of the expenses incurred, see Dard Hunter, Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft , 2nd edition, New York, 1947; rpt. edition, New York, 1978, chapters 6, 8 passim. 20 Stevenson, Missale , p. 91; cf. idem., New Briquet , vol. 1, pp. * 19, * 33. See also Likhachev's inferences on the high prices paid for paper imported (in the sixteenth century, primarily from France) into Muscovy, where domestic manufacturing was not established until the mid-seventeenth century. ( Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, pp. LXXIV-LXXVII, LVII, LXVIII; cf. Shchepkin, Paleografiia , pp. 97-98). 21 Stevenson, Missale , passim, especially chapter 6, "Runs and Remnants," pp. 94-96. See also Likhachev, Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, p. LXXVI for an example of a sheet left over from the paper supply used for a Russian manuscript written in 1456, turning up in another written three years later at the same scriptorium. 22 Both Shchepkin and Stevenson criticized Briquet for a lack of rigor in the application of the term "variété identique" to the marks he found, which would imply that his statistics on the use time for the 2558 marks and their dated variants that he so designated cannot of course be relied on absolutely. (Shchepkin, Paleografiia , pp. 205-206; Stevenson, Missale , pp. 61-64, idem, New Briquet , vol. 1, pp. * 32-* 33, cf. the same author's introduction to Charles M. Briquet, Briquet's Opuscula , Hilversum, Holland, 1955, p. xxvi). Nevertheless they surely can be accepted as serviceable guidelines. Stevenson himself indicated that a remnant may be contemporary with the main mark in a work, or may be as much as five or ten years older than the latter ( Missale , pp. 94-95), and as noted earlier (note eleven), Shchepkin provided information on a small sample of late sixteenth-/early seventeenth-century manuscripts on European paper whose date of manufacture is indicated in the watermark itself, and found that on the average, foreign paper was used in Rus' not much longer than a decade after its production ( Paleografiia , p. 205). See also Likhachev, Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, pp. LXXII-LXXIV, on the idea that European paper in its country of origin and in Rus' was used within about a decade of its manufacture. 23 Gosudarstvennyi istoricheskii muzei (Moscow) [hereafter GIM], Muzeiskoe sobranie No. 4056 (10, 554 fols.; formerly Obshchestvo Liubitelei Drevnei Pis'mennosti [hereafter OLDP] F VII 380). This manuscript is described in detail under its former designation in Kh. M. Loparev, Opisanie rukopisei obshchestva liubitelei drevnei pis' mennosti , 3 vols., St. Petersburg, 1892-1899, vol. 1, pp. 9-59. 24 Gosudarstvennaia ordena Lenina biblioteka SSR imeni V. I. Lenina (Moscow) [hereafter GBL] f. 205, Sobranie Obshchestva istorii i drevnostei rossiiskikh No. 328 (10, 420 fols.). This manuscript is described very briefly in P. M. Stroev, ed., Biblioteka imperatorskago obshchestva istorii i drevnostei rossiiskikh , Moscow, 1845, vol. 1, otdelenie 1, p. 148. 25 The texts in K-B 31 are preceeded by six blank folios (fol. I, pasted to the inside front cover; fol. II [both numbered in pencil]; and four unnumbered blank folios that I designate fols. 01-04). The next 279 folios in K-B 31 contain: "Skazanie mnogoslovnomu poslaniiu" (an introduction to the text, written by a different author); the body of Poslanie ; two blank unnumbered folios (fols. 05-06); and a homily by Basil of Caesarea, meant by the Poslanie author to be integrated into the polished version of his text in some fashion. Five more blank folios follow (fol. III, numbered in pencil, and fols. 07-010, no numeration). Arabic numbers in ink mark the folios containing the three texts, occasionally appearing also in pencil to correct a mistake in the ink numbering whereby two folios were assigned the number 91. When folios after no. 91 are referred to, two numbers will be given—the first representing the original pagination, and the second, the correct folio count. Thirty-three Cyrillic signatures, in ink, mark the thirty-two eight folio quires, and the one twelve-folio quire on which Poslanie and the Basilean homily are written. (For a detailed description of K-B 31, see Yanoshak, "Zinovii," pp. 483-494. On "Skazanie," the Basilean homily, and the relationship of each to Poslanie and the K-B 31 manuscript, see idem, pp. 160-172, 179-209). 26 The degree of resemblance which the marks being dealt with bear to the album reproductions are described according to the following categories, based, with slight modifications, on those proposed by Waugh (" De Visu , p. 104): of the type; 2) similar; 3) variant; 4) close variant; 5) likeness (fair, good, excellent). 27 1878 appears twenty-four times (nineteen as a distorted variant/later state, five as a very good/excellent likeness), and 1879, eighteen times (twelve as a very good/excellent likeness, six as a close variant). In a quarto such as K-B 31 it is theoretically possible that each of the eight-folio quires could contain one set of companion marks, and thus in the twenty-four gatherings in which 1878 and 1879 are distributed, each might appear matched together twenty-four times. There are however other marks interspersed among these gatherings. Nevertheless, 1878 is at least found often enough times to have been once a part of each quire, while 1879 comes close. Moreover, in eight of their gatherings, 1878 and 1879 do appear together as matched pairs. Viewed as twins, these marks denote a consistent stock of paper occurring nearly without interruption from gathering 7 (i.e. of those numbered by Cyrillic signatures) through 25; 27 through 30; and also in 32. Viewed as separate marks, they still constitute the longest runs in the work, 1879 running through gatherings 8-19, 21, 24, and 30, and 1878 in gatherings 7-8, 11, 13, 17-23, 25, 27-30, and 32. (See Table 1 for more details). 28 1901 is found in Cyrillic-numbered quires 1, 3, 4, 5 (twice in this gathering), and 6, and 1902 is in nos. 1, 2 (twice), 3, 4, and 6. 29 Muzeiskoe 4056 is the source of Likhachev nos. 1870-1900. In Likhachev's album (1: 177), its number (OLDP F VII [380]) is mistakenly given as 389 (VII). According to my inspection, its most characteristic marks are varieties of 1874 or 1875, and 1880 or 1881. 1874, apparently the most frequently appearing mark, is found sixty-eight times; 1878 appears twelve times and 1879 eleven, matched together on fols. 345-348, and, with three other marks interspersed, on fols. 378-399. (See Yanoshak, "Zinovii," pp. 130-132 for further details). 30 OIDR 328 is the source of Likhachev nos. 1901-1913. Its most frequent mark is 1906 (26 times). In this manuscript I found 1878 and 1879 together distributed nearly equally (13 instances of 1878, 10 of 1879) on fols. 340-360 and 367-383. 1901 (12 times) and 1902 (6 times) alternate on fols. 271-298 and 303-304. (See Yanoshak, "Zinovii," pp. 130-132 for further information.) 31 The source of Likhachev 3356 was listed as a letter dated 30 April 1567 by G. I. Zabolotskii, a voevoda of Rugodiv (Narva) ( Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, p. 394); although identification is not certain, a variant may also be found, unnoted by Likhachev, in Muzeiskoe 4056. 32 The K-B 31 mark resembling Likhachev 1907 is also a close variant of 3450, taken from the celebrated Muscovite Apostol' of 1564, printed by Deacon Ivan Fedorov, and traditionally considered the first book printed in Muscovy (See Table 1), although several anonymous works may actually antedate it (A. S. Zernova, Nachalo knigopechataniia v Moskve i na Ukraine , Moscow, 1947, pp. 7-46, 79). 33 The source of Likhachev 1920 was a Margarit , or collection of the homilies of John Chrysostom (see Table 1). 34 This was the only mark in K-B 31 which could not be identified with one in a work of Russian provenance. Its source was a letter written by Marshall de Montluc, dated 11 October, 1562. (See Likhachev, Paleograficheskoe znachenie , vol. 1, p. 367, and Table 1.) 35 The source of 1856 is a Trefoloi , a service book for holidays, dated 1561/1562; that of 4090, a Sbornik (Collection) of Saints' Lives, written in 1565 (see Table 1). 36 One of these marks is a glove which shares design features with three marks encompassing the period 1560-1567 (Briquet 11028, dated 1566; Likhachev 1878 or 1879; Briquet 11017, dated 1561; Likhachev 3343, dated 1560), and appears twice in K-B 31. The other two doubtful marks are spheres, each appearing once in K-B 31. One shares features with three marks whose dates range from 1563 to 1567 (Likhachev 3440, dated 1564; Briquet 14029, dated 1563; Likhachev 1913, dated 1567) and is perhaps closest to Likhachev 3440, but even here the resemblance is rather vague. The other sphere vaguely resembles two marks (Likhachev 1853, dated 1561/1562, and Likhachev 1892, dated 1567), but again, identification is extremely uncertain (see Table 1). 37 Thus, K-B 31 shares, as runs or remnants, at least five marks with Muzeiskoe 4056 (Likhachev 1878, 1879, 1872, 1892, 1888, and, possibly, 3356), and six with OIDR 328 (Likhachev 1878, 1879, 1901, 1902, 1905, 1907).</field>
