      <field name="fulltext">At a recent conference on "Shakespeare: Text and Deconstruction" 1 I suggested it was no accident that the current "revisionist" textual view of certain Shakespeare plays 2 had occurred during a period of post-structuralist unease with the fixed, determinate text of literary criticism, or, similarly, that the hegemony of New Criticism—despite its ostensible rejection of intention —had corresponded with the domination of the single, eclectic text reflecting auctorial intentionality. 3 I was not supposing that textual and literary critics had been in conscious emulation of each other, but rather that a specific intellectual climate made some critical and textual assumptions more likely or plausible at some times than at others. 4 In other words, that particular critical and textual practices were promoted and sustained by a general theoretical disposition. Like it or not, we live in a period of theory. Courses taught in graduate schools, books published by young scholars, sessions held at professional conferences—all reflect the literary concentration on theory as something distinct from, (although perhaps dependent on), the empirical, evaluative, or historical criticism of earlier decades. Inevitably, there is resistance to this movement—from both literary critics and from textual critics. Among the literary folk are those "humanists" who regard structuralism, post-structuralism, marxism and the rest as arid, if not immoral, 5 and among the textuists Shakespearians who wish to retain the securities of a single text, mediaevalists who seek the one Chaucer among the many, modernists who want their Joyce clear not synoptic. And, equally inevitably, the quiet business of "traditional" literary criticism still goes on, as, of course, does the business of textual criticism and editing. However, the textual-critical business has in recent years confronted some of the issues raised by literary theory, beginning with the pioneering work of Bowers in his Textual and Literary Criticism (1966). 6 To cite just two exemplary cases: Tanselle's 1979 article on final intention used Wimsatt, Beardsley, Hancher, Hirsch, and T. M. Gang in its analysis of the theoretical problem of intentionality, 7 and James McLaverty's 1984 article on intention 8 employed evidence drawn from literary theorists and critics (Hirsch), behavorial psychologists (Skinner), structuralist linguists (Saussure), and philosophers (Collingwood). More recent studies by, for example, Peter Shillingsburg, Hershel Parker, Jerome McGann, Louis Hay, and Hans Gabler 9 have confirmed that practising textual critics are prepared to engage the literary theorists and to make use of some of their concepts. And sessions at textual conventions (indeed, entire conferences) 10 have investigated the interplay between literary and textual dispensations. As we might have anticipated, the literary theorists have, in general, not returned the favour. Some "theoretical" journals have published articles by textual scholars, 11 and the more adventurous literary critics have, on occasion, included textual problems in their consideration of theory 12 or have taken part in the public debate. But for the most part, the literary theorists have continued their work as if there had been no advances in textual-critical theory in the last few decades, 13 and—on our side of the fence—the editing of texts has sometimes continued without a full or articulated investigation of the theoretical choices involved in each separate editorial task. 14 But despite the general lack of territorial engagement, it is clear that textuists need a theory (or theories) of textuality as a medium for dialogue—with each other or with those from different disciplines. A purely empirical approach—a recital of the specific circumstances of specific texts and the story of the editorial resolution of the problems they engender—can perhaps have a useful role in the accountability of editors for what they have done, and will, of course, be cited in the textual introductions for any responsible textual edition. But some synthesis of various individual and exemplary experiences is necessary to make them comprehensive and comprehensible, and Tanselle's occasional encyclopaedic surveys of the field in Studies in Bibliography in part fulfill this function, 15 although they also illuminate textual argument at large and frequently tie this argument to the theoretical postures employed in other disciplines (as in the "Final Intentions" article). But local empiricism ("this is what we did and why we did it") has, because of its concentration upon experience, little to offer those who have not yet had, and are perhaps unlikely to have, the same or a similar experience. 16 What theory does offer is (in the words of W.J.T. Mitchell in the introductory essay to Against Theory ) "reflection, fundamental principles, models, schemes, systems, large-scale guesswork, metaphysics, speculation, intuition, and abstract thought" in parallel series to an "empiricist" list of "immediate perception, surface phenomena, things in themselves, small-scale certainty, physics, traditional wisdom, discursive reading, and concrete experience." 17 It is not, of course, that theory is better than empiricism (or vice versa), nor that empiricism (particularly in such items on the list as "small-scale certainty" and "traditional wisdom") is not necessary to the editorial task (most of the qualities in Mitchell's "empiricist" list are indeed justifiably prized by editors)—but rather that theory provides a matrix for the plotting of the "certainties", small or otherwise, since it delineates a schema for the measurement of editorial attitudes and "reflections". And, of course, textual criticism has not been shy of theory. From Alexandrian "analogy" through to Lachmannian stemmatics, Greg-Bowers intentionalism, and McGann social textual criticism, theories of how authors work, (even of who or what authors are ), how texts are generated and transmitted, and how they should be represented to an audience, have been used to define, defend, and proselytise a theoretical view of the nature of composition, production and transmission—an ontology of the text, if you will. Thus, when Lachmann declares that the archetype of the Lucretius can be reconstituted and shows how this is to be done by the charting of "truth" and "error" in a genealogical table of witnesses, extant and inferred, he is inevitably privileging that archetype as the major desideratum of the textual scholar, and incidentally but forcefully invalidating the significance of the codices descripti lower down the family tree. Within the matrix of possible privileged positions, he is endorsing the relative chronological "superiority" of the archetype (although, note, not the fair copy, which remains unplottable and therefore without privilege) against inferior "copy", scribal reinscription etc. This seems obvious enough—and quite proper—to most classically-trained textual scholars, but it needs saying for two reasons: first, because no dictum should be implicitly and permanently accepted without continual demonstration of its validity (and what might have worked as a model in the transmission of classical texts need not be immutably pertinent in other periods), and second, because the theoretical grounds for an empirical assertion should be understood as a part of its evidentiary status. In other words, there is no "natural" or "self-evident" ontology of the text, but rather a series of alternative "metaphysics" displaying "fundamental principles" (to return to Mitchell's terminology) which will involve some degree of "speculation", some "intuition" and even, as most textual critics are willing to admit, some "large-scale guesswork". As Tanselle notes, all editing requires a measure of critical judgement (or, in Mitchell's words, speculative "guesswork") which might have "large-scale" implications. 18 Why belabour all of this if it ought to be obvious to the practitioner? Well, the major reason for raising the issue now, for an audience of bibliographers old and new, is that the matrix I spoke of has been very largely redrawn by our neighbours in literary criticism, in history, philosophy, even sociology and mathematics, and if textual criticism is to remain one of the major intellectual disciplines of our culture, it must at the very least be aware of this redrawing, at those parts of the matrix that bisect the accepted or acceptable notions of "text" and "author". Developments in, say, structuralist linguistics and anthropology, or in the new science of "chaos", 19 no longer keep to their neat disciplinary boundaries, but on the contrary, they create new disciplines in the gaps left by the retreating older ones. This tendency (noted in the very recent history of chaos in particular) has broad institutional implications. As the work of legal scholars like Rawls or anthropologists like Clifford Geetz shows, there has been a movement towards finding the centre of the humanist and social science ethic in the "textual variance" of the "texts" studied. 20 Philosophers like Richard Rorty (and literary critics like Robert Scholes) have even suggested that the typical research university will eventually reformulate itself to contain "textual departments" (rather than departments of English, history, philosophy, sociology etc.). 21 Such a possible institutional redefinition—if it ever happens (and Scholes we should note heads not an English department but a Center for Culture and Media at Brown) will be a direct product of the redrawing of the map of the text and its author and reader, and on this new map textual scholarship—as we have traditionally understood that term—must find a place, indeed a central not a marginal place. It would be a lost opportunity, and a major intellectual tragedy, if textual scholarship were not to seek a role in future "departments of texts", but it cannot achieve this status if its practitioners remain resolutely unaware of, or even hostile to, the disciplinary and institutional changes which have caused the map to be redrawn. As I have argued elsewhere, literary critics have all too often assumed that in the new textualism (or even in the old evaluative criticism) "any text will do". 22 No reader of Studies in Bibliography would accept such a dismissive retreat from textual responsibility, and it is thus our job to know where we stand, almost literally, in the redrawing of the terrain. The rest of this article, after this somewhat polemical introduction to the problem, addresses the question of the new matrix and the new drawing. It attempts to show where textual editors do indeed stand, by their work and their theories, in the interstercial choices that are now available. It is genuinely a prolegomenon, for it offers only the outlines of how our editorial and textual practices share certain natural affiliations with the positions of textuists of a different stamp. It does not produce anything, for I doubt that immediate or local editorial decisions will change as a result of the plotting I suggest; but it may give a local habitation and a name (and thereby another level of coherence and identity) to our textual enterprise. One final methodological caveat : in order to keep the basic outlines of the new matrix clear, much of the supporting—or conflicting—argument is embedded marginally in explanatory notes, where the curious reader can follow up particular aspects of the critical or literary theories under discussion. I begin with a (mis)quotation, which can be a brief exercise in critical attribution. "I start then with the postulate that what the [critic] is concerned with is pieces of paper or parchment covered with certain written or printed signs . With these signs he is concerned merely as arbitrary marks; their meaning is no business of his." (emphases mine) This sounds like one of the "hermeneutical mafia" pontificating again—perhaps Eco or Culler (given the concentration on signs), Derrida, de Man, Hillis Miller, or Hartman—we may all have our favourite candidates. But the mis quotation is instructive in this case. The first sentence should read: "the bibliographer " [not critic ] is concerned with . . . signs" etc. And the author of this espousal of the arbitrariness of signs and the impropriety of meaning? Not a refugee from the École Normale Superieur nor even from Geneva, Konstanz, or New Haven, but that stalwart of Anglo-American "strict" bibliography, W. W. Greg. If bibliographers disdain mere meaning, what chance for those toiling in both literary and textual fields? But the apparent coincidence of view (culled, I admit, from Greg's more polemical writings in defence of bibliography as a "science" of "forms") 23 can be valuable, as I have suggested: literary and textual critics and theorists may not have spoken to each other directly in the last half-century or so, but there may be parallel conceptual or methodological issues at stake in their attitudes to that mysterious immanence—the "text". The following brief survey attempts to construct a few possible models where such parallels may be observed in operation. We may find some strange bedfellows, and some of the supposed paradigms may look strained on first acquaintance, but I would hope that a general loosening of the strict territorial imperatives could be of benefit to both parties. I would like to use a very familiar structure: the writer-, text- and reader-based theories of both literary and textual dispensations. The familiarity of this tripartite division of the textual spoils may modify the apparent heterodoxy of my other suggestions by framing them in a system that offers comparatively little contention. From a critical point of view, one would expect to encounter, for example, intentionalist theories, phenomenological theories, historical-critical "objectivist" theories in the first (writer-based) division; formalist, New-Critical, textual-analytical, structuralist theories in the second (text-based) division; and reception, deconstructive, jouissance (or "readerly-play") theories in the third (reader-based) division. It is obviously an over-simplification, but it will do to give a rough orientation to the textual and critical dispensations to be covered. Let us first admit that some of the possible theoretical filiations are more honestly (or perhaps more directly) stated than others. For example, Steven Mailloux's suggested revision of the Hancher-Tanselle line on intention in his Interpretive Conventions (1982) 24 acknowledges the presence of Stanley Fish in his title, his method, and his documentation. (Ultimately, I think his argument responds more to Poulet and a phenomenological reading of intention than a Fishian, but that is another question.) 25 On the other hand, Jerome McGann's assault—in his Critique of Modern Textual Criticism 26 —upon the Greg-Bowers definition of (and apparent need for) intention makes no such attempt to place itself in the general inheritance of critical speculation, and therefore has appeared more contentious (and revolutionary) to other textual critics than it really is. The Geneva and Konstanz schools, Fishian affective stylistics and interpretive communities, even the good old textus receptus —one of the hoariest of textual données —may all lie behind McGann's position in the Critique , but they are not an informing part of his argument as they have been in some of his other historical and critical works. And this is particularly important, given the sweeping political arguments that underlie McGann's book. Some textual critics would simply consign McGann's work to the demesne of "literary criticism" and therefore ignore it (interestingly, the Critique was reviewed in TLS 27 under the rubric of "literary theory", not "Textual Criticism" or "Bibliography"), but as the very rationale of this survey suggests, I believe that all textual or literary arguments, even the least valuable in practice, rest upon certain theoretical assumptions which must be questioned and made to give an account of themselves. But on to the first stage: writer-based theories. As already suggested, the dominant phase of an intentionalist textual theoretical school in this last half-century has clearly been the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle promotion of "original" intentions for form (accidentals) and "final" intentions for content (substantives). This distinction between form and content is obviously not perfect or absolute, (and would not be accepted as such by the major proponents of the theory) 28 but it shows the relative direction of the historical values inherent in the theory (i.e., the "dual" or "divided" authority of two different manifestations of intention, often at two or more different historical moments). The theory is compounded or reinforced by—and draws much of its evidence from—an admixture of history of technology usually shown in a reliance on data drawn from analytical bibliography, with which the school is also associated. As McLaverty has already demonstrated, this general ideology is most closely allied with Hirsch's definition of an auctorially intended "meaning" 29 —an historically determinable objective context which is yet another resuscitation of supposedly moribund historical criticism. In fact, in his recent survey of Bowers' contributions to textual criticism ( PBSA 30 , on the occasion of Bowers' eightieth birthday celebrations), Tanselle makes much of this historical rationale for the Greg-Bowers jurisdiction. (Whether Greg could have foreseen that his essay on copy-text would have led to such wide-ranging contention in textual criticism is obviously beside the point: both his disciples and his apostates seem to agree on the basic terms of the debate, and disagree primarily on their specific applicability to fields beyond Renaissance drama.) Thus, I think it was no accident that the related school of New Bibliography was pertinently so called as an historical antidote to the New Criticism (as well as in reaction to the old , belletristic, bibliography), for the New Criticism had an avowed ahistorical bias. Parker's and Higgins' " New Scholarship", short-lived as a critical and political term, might have been trying to make a similarly reactive and polemical point, but since the term was withdrawn soon after its coinage, it never achieved a coherent body of demonstration. 31 The more significant observation for our paradigmatic purposes is that such an historical/intentionalist emphasis lies not only within Hirschian auspices but also within phenomenological (and even some aspects of hermeneutical) as well. Thus, Husserl's "intentional" theory of consciousness, whereby the text is seen as an embodiment of auctorial consciousness, 32 Gadamer's partial—and early—espousal of the varying relevance of "meaning" to auctorial intention, 33 and most persuasively, Hans Robert Jauss' defining of the literary work within its individual historical "horizon", 34 leading to the concept of the cultural and chronological "alterity" or "otherness" of the work 35 —all of these share a reliance upon historical intention for their definitions and methodologies. Now, there are obvious refinements to be made which mar the paradigms to some extent—so, for example, Gadamer's insistence on the hermeneutical "relativity" of meaning, supportive as it might be initially of historical criticism (and therefore intention), also allows by extension the continuity of meaning through time which McGann endorses in the Critique . 36 But, despite such reservations, I think the basic model holds up clearly enough. One might argue that any intentionalist school is ultimately a product of the old Germanic philological dispensation of Altertumswissenschaft ; in textual theory, for example, most of the dissenters from the Greg-Bowers principles of copy-text (one thinks of Thorpe and Gaskell 37 as prime instances) would probably still regard themselves as practising a form of intentionalist, historical criticism—it is merely that the historical focus is placed elsewhere, say, on printed editions rather than on auctorial manuscripts. In this speculative tour of paradigms, we move next to text-based theories, where the mid-century influence of Formalist/New-Critical decontextualisation of the text is well-attested. The orthodox Formalist concentration on defamiliarisation 38 (of which more anon) shows a predisposition to respond to particular types of inter- (or perhaps, more correctly, intra -) textual relationships (particularly multi-layered ironies), and this intra-textual layering, albeit under objective bibliographical principles) can be observed in the synoptic text of Gabler's Ulysses (and perhaps in any "texte génétique" as well—although that's a more problematical question). 39 I am not convinced that genetic editors—despite their generally phenomenological assertions—belong automatically in the intentionalist division; it depends on the use made of the genetically-derived material. Perhaps paradoxically, Gabler's "clear-text" reading page could be seen as a "New-Critical" resolution of the structuralist ironies present in the synoptic text (i.e., as the critic/editor's selection of readings which remove or explain or fulfil the layers of meaning in the text, in the manner of a formalist's objective codification of the linguistic tensions in the work); or , the clear text might represent auctorial "final" intention as well as, or in place of, a merely critically -resolved final structure. Stated bluntly, the problem in any joint synoptic/clear text edition is how far does the latter stage correspond to final intention, insofar as that can be delineated in any single , eclectic text? But with or without clear text, a synoptic text—where multiple authority exists, of course—is a sort of "scrambled" (but presumably decodable) version of the Lachmannian filiative system, except that the synoptic text may eschew the hierarchical format of variants on which the Lachmann method depends. (The distinction is not entirely apt, as I recognise, for even a synoptic text must have a "base" text on which the diacritics can map the dynamic of textual growth, but the formal arrangement of a synoptic text is not inevitably genealogical or stemmatic, as the Lachmann system always is.) 40 This Lachmann system McGann (mistakenly, I believe) regards as the unfortunate progenitor of modern intentionalism 41 —as a part of his general case against the intentionalist inheritance of the Greg-Bowers school. On the contrary, I would hold that Lachmann was primarily a sort of proto-structuralist, for even the potential embarrassment of the circular logic represented by the definition of "error" does not fundamentally detract from the Lacmannian's insistence on the structuralist descriptiveness of filiation (i.e., the stage identified by recensio , not by emendatio or divinatio ). And, of course, the structuralist system of bipolar oppositions 42 (on/off, night/day, good/bad) is seen most tellingly, and used most compellingly, in the Lachmannian insistence upon the determination of vertical transmission by the opposition of "truth" and "error", a dualism which also surfaced in the bipartite stemmata for which Bédier had such scorn. 43 In fact, it was this very putative (and in his view spurious) structuralist "objectivity" which so enraged Housman and led him to claim that the Germans had confused textual criticism with mathematics! 44 Similarly, it is the social and literary structuralists' reduction of society and literature to a series of positive or negative equations and their resultant denial of subjective evaluation which in these later days has so enraged the humanist critics. 45 While McGann does acknowledge that there is an intellectual disjunct between Lachmannian stemmatics and twentieth-century intentionalism, it is, I think, a mischaracterisation of the history of textual theory to place the Lachmannian method and its aims (as he does) in a linear relationship with the Greg-Bowers school. The problem with McGann's "schematic history" is that, despite the noted disjunct, he fails properly to recognise the very limited status of the archetype in the Lachmannian system—an acknowledgedly corrupt state of textual transmission which does not respond to intention. Housman saw this weakness in the Lachmannian argument, when he accused the school of relying upon hope rather than judgement in their acquiescence to what amounted to a "best-text" theory, 46 although it was not so called. (There are, of course, several ironies in the terms of this conflict.) A separate, and much fuller, study would be required to argue the problem of whether a filiative theory of textual criticism is analogous to the sort of geneticism practised by so many contemporary European textuists—Hay, Lebrave, Zeller—or whether Soviet textology, with its emphasis on the "unintentional", "non-authorial" remaniment, is similarly structuralist. 47 As my general tone would indicate, I believe they probably are. There is one possibly valid methodological distinction which might be raised, however. If the concentration is on the process of creation as an indication of intention (e.g., Lebrave, or Gabler in the assumed relations between his synoptic and clear-text phases), 48 then the textual theory and practice may be deemed phenomenological, as Mailloux has already implicitly recognised. 49 If, on the other hand, the concentration is seen primarily as a vehicle for the mere mapping of alternatives (auctorial and non-auctorial)—i.e., a critical variorum of variant "states"—then the theory and practice is primarily structuralist. 50 It depends on whether the analogy is what Frye claims to have done for genre in the Anatomy 51 (descriptive, non-evaluative criticism) or what Barthes does for Balzac 52 and advertisements (descriptive, analytical, and reader-defined). A charting of the particles of a text (Slavic textology and perhaps Zeller and Hay) will be polysemic almost malgré lui (and therefore semiotic and therefore structuralist) rather than primarily intentionalist. The difference in emphasis may be significant, for an intentionalist, writer-based theory would attach no inherent value to these later polysemic structures, except insofar as they could be shown to represent "coded" or "embedded" auctorial intention—at presumably a "post-textual" (or at any rate a "post-auctorial" stage of transmission). But a structuralist or semiotic text-based or reader-based theory would obviously find the major interest in the variety of structures, whether or no this represented the intentionality of a single consciousness. 53 It would be either the interaction of these structures (their intertextuality , if you like), or the reader's play on their polysemic array, which would be the main focus of the activities of such critics. I would also hold that the earliest formal structuralism (even though occasionally intentionalist as well) is Third Century BC Alexandrian analogy , whereby an analysis of remaniement structures could be used to determine the nature and content of the phenomenological "gaps" in the documentation of intention. (If the reader will forgive the play, a very convenient modern analogy for analogy would be the non-analog digital method of a CD player, which can be programmed to eradicate transmissional "errors" and to leap over "gaps" in the surface of the CD.) The irony of this ancient Alexandrian system is that it begins to sound rather like the phenomenologist Ingarden's schemata , 54 used to fill "gaps" in the contextual "frame of reference" of the work, and similar to Wolfgang Iser's "strategies" or "repertoires" of themes and codes which again form phenomenological structures for the resolution of intentional cruxes. 55 The Alexandrians' promotion of an ideology of the "Homeric" (or "non-Homeric") line could lead either to a subjective play reminiscent of Barthian jouissance (under the "creative" textual emendations practised by Zenodotus of Ephesus) or (under the more austere "coding" of variants without implicit status practised by Aristarchus of Samothrace), 56 to a conservative reticence reminiscent of Zeller or the Slavic textologists. The principle is the same; it's the practice that varies. And this principle, made notorious by Bentley's infamous edition of Paradise Lost , is very much alive and well in what I believe to be the equally post-structuralist jeu of Kane/Donaldson's Piers Plowman , where the editors, under the guise of intentionality—of constructing what Langland wrote, or ought to have written—playfully (and successfully) fabricate a writerly ( scriptible ) text which responds to the needs of the reader (and the editor) for "perfectability" in the alliterative line, and not, so David Fowler argues, to the cumulative documentary evidence. 57 Concluding the triad, we encounter reader-based theories (which, as I have implicitly suggested, can derive very conveniently from apparently text-based theories, as the Kane/Donaldson edition demonstrates). The clearest statement in recent textual theory is, of course, in McGann's Critique —the endorsement, in nineteenth-century editing at least, of the so-called "social" school of textual criticism. 58 Intentionality evaporates in the historical continuum of interpretive communities, for, as in later Fish, there is a shifting of focus from the nature of auctorial consciousness through the nature of the text to the nature of the reading and reconstruction of books. As I have already noted, this position is related to the ancient doctrine of the textus receptus , the cumulative history of the text beyond auctorial control, and is nothing terribly new, even on the "textual" front. On the "critical" front, it is even less startling, for Heidegger's insistence on meanings as "situational" (i.e., fluent and relativistic) 59 and Gadamer's and Jauss' charting of the passage of meaning from one cultural context to another 60 can both be seen to anticipate McGann's position. Ironically, so could Hirsch's acceptance of the fluctuating "significance" of the work, 61 although I recognise that Hirsch is really talking about other than the formal features of the text in this case. Furthermore, I would hazard that Bakhtin's concept of the linguistic community as a battleground over meaning (where "ideological contention" may achieve resolution through such processional devices as the "carnival" of language), 62 might also be observed behind McGann's "new" position. Competing views over "continuity" versus "determinism" have been seen recently in our Attorney General's endorsement of "a jurisprudence of original intention", which Justice Brennan regards as the unfortunate result of minds having "no familiarity with the historical record." 63 Brennan's "relativistic" view of interpretation appears in, for example, Bruce Ackerman's affective theory of constitutionalism, which is frankly based on a Fishian method. 64 "Relativism" versus "Originalism" was, of course, the focus of the debate over the nomination to the Supreme Court of the historical conservative Robert Bork. The most notorious demonstration of the post-textual game is the Barthean and Derridean jeu , 65 the "play" on the elements of the text, the purpose of which is the gradual exposure of the inherent aporia , the "central knot of indeterminacy", which is the death-knell not only of auctorial intention and of structuralist system but of codifiable or historically consistent reading as well. Since both reading and writing are temporal media (processional, indeed), we should not be surprised that such indeterminacies are rampant, and some major authors (and critics) have been justifiably brought to book for them. Was Eve created together with Adam or from his rib? What sex was Robinson Crusoe's goat? Did Beowulf have a misspent youth or didn't he? Such textual indeterminacy may be a product of post-auctorial intervention (see, for example, Steven Urkowitz's and others' claims about the history of the conflated editing of Lear , 66 or the sectarian editing of the New Testament) or, it may result from a combination of internal and external (i.e., auctorial and editorial) "de-construction". Hershel Parker's recent textual career 67 has been dominated by a concern for such self-contradictions in American fiction of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, where the argument is that these texts cannot be read as if they were single creative entities. However, Parker's "knot of indeterminacy" could presumably be avoided with enough auctorial and editorial care and control, whereas (according to Hillis Miller at least), 68 the deconstructor merely demonstrates the native aporia of the text—he does not create it, and it is, in fact, inevitable. But Parker's and Derrida's concerns, while differently motivated, are not dissimilar in their application: both tend to take the specific image, scene, or fragmentary moment, and to work the implications and ambiguities of this moment in its reflective qualities throughout the text (back and forth), to allow it to accomplish the dismantling of the logic of the text as a whole. 69 Both are interested in the "traces" of meaning left in a text, and both are concerned with différance , the reader's continually having to "defer" a conclusive, closed interpretation of a text. To both critics, texts are embarrassments, embarrassments of narrative and of logic. Where does this leave us? I had a neat and superficially plausible conclusion for this survey, full of tropes of balance and dialectic, historicism and relativism, but since this prolegomenon really offers only a descriptive challenge rather than a synthetic resolution, such a conclusion would probably be unjustifiable at this stage of the debate. So, instead, I have a specific, rather than a general assertion: it is not exactly an example , for both Hillis Miller and Tanselle have proclaimed, from their very different textual positions, 70 that good theories are not necessarily proven by the weight of demonstration, but it is an illustration, maybe even an illumination. The Formalist Shklovsky proclaimed that "defamiliarisation" ( estranje ) was an essential function of literary language, and the implication of this assertion is that the intention of a truly "literary" author is to evoke a sense of the defamiliar. 71 As has often been observed, this emphasis on the defamiliarisation of language tends to promote a criticism of texts for their ironic qualities, and therefore tends to favour texts with linguistic or metaphorical tensions which may appear inaccessible or paradoxical but which can be resolved by the formalist critic's elucidation. Thus, the power of formalist criticism is to describe the auctorial defamiliarisation of language while ultimately rendering it accessible. I would hold that the "classical" textual theory of lectio difficilior probior/potior est (the more difficult reading is the more "correct" or "moral" or "powerful") 72 operates under the same assumption that auctorial intention will be embedded in the least "familiar" (to scribe and reader) of the variants available. In fact, the textual dogma may go further than this, and in the hands of conjecturalist critics it might suggest that a "difficult" reading representative of auctorial will must be created where documentary evidence yields only an accessible variant or variants. Used as a technical device in charting stemmatic filiations (i.e., the direction of "error"), the lectio difficilior is, like estranje , an endorsement of an ideology of literariness that shows itself primarily in its disjunctive nature (i.e., disjunctive from the norm, the expected, and the derivative). Both theories emphasise originality of mind and linguistic usage as the primary means of the recovery of auctorial intention, and both rest upon a definition of literariness that is assumed rather than tested. And both (ironically) claim to be purely formal, objective, analytical methods of approaching the text while in fact depending upon highly problematical evaluative positions. My contention for this occasion is simply that the conceptual and methodological premises of such ideological pairings of literary and textual theory could benefit from a simultaneous investigation. Much work needs to be done to suggest how differing theoretical perceptions would result in differing texts, and I have elsewhere sketched some of the evidence that might be used to determine whether an edition is "formalist" or "structuralist" or "deconstructive". 73 But, as the various and several appearances in this survey of such complex editions as Gabler's Ulysses and Kane/Donaldson's Piers Plowman demonstrate, two or more competing theoretical dispensations might lie behind the practice of editors: there might (as in Kane/Donaldson) be a divergence between announced editorial purposes and the "performance" of the editors on the textual page, or (as in Gabler) a potential theoretical disjunct between the two facing pages of the text. These delicacies—and contradictions—need a subtler articulation than is possible here, and I am now engaged on such a large-scale study; but for the moment my aim is more modest—descriptive and paradigmatic rather than practical or empirical. I do believe that an awareness of the theoretical assumptions behind an edition—even when these assumptions might seem multiple and perhaps contradictory—can be helpful to an understanding and evaluation of the results of the editing, but I do not yet suppose that this initial fragile matrix will hold the entire history of textual scholarship and the debates thereon. And Greg? Are we to place him among the prescient post-structuralists rather than among the strict and pure bibliographers? Probably not, for his insistence on the inaccessibility of inherent meaning can be accounted for historically by a dogmatic bibliographical reliance on the technology of textual analysis, where intended meaning as an aesthetic predisposition on the part of the textual critic (see Bentley and Kane/ Donaldson) might indeed be seen as a liability to the practising historian of technology or to the "objective" textual critic. Greg provides the provocation for this paper, but I do not regard him as a forerunner of Jacques Derrida.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A preliminary version of this article was presented in Atlanta, Georgia, at a SAMLA convention (1985) in a session on "Editing and Recent Literary Theory". 1 "Shakespeare: Text and Deconstruction" (December, 1985), CUNY Graduate Center. The paper was an attempt to draw together recent developments in Shakespeare studies as described in conference papers by both textual critics (Steven Urkowitz and T. H. Howard-Hill, and literary critics (Annabel Patterson and Jean Howard). 2 I.e., the growing insistence that the variant states of such plays as Hamlet (1603, 1605, 1623), King Lear (1608, 1623), Romeo and Juliet (1597, 1599), and Merry Wives of Windsor (1600, 1623) demonstrate the hand of Shakespeare the "reviser", rather than a single "authoritative" version with corrupt variant states, created, for example, by "memorial reconstruction" or inept piracy. 3 The influence of the New Criticism and eclectic, single-intention texts is, of course, not perfectly co-terminous, for the principles of the eclectic text were formed over several centuries of experimentation and of a gradual increase in the early twentieth-century knowledge of the technical circumstances of the transmission of Elizabethan drama, whereas New Criticism was a much more recent (and local) phenomenon. However, each achieved a dominant academic position in the first few decades after the Second World War, with New Criticism ceding to structuralism and other theoretical persuasions and eclecticism being challenged by revisionism in the early and mid-1970's. 4 There is inevitably some irony in the New Critics' having rejected intention as a motivating force for their analysis (indeed, in having disdained it as a "Fallacy"), while using the concept of the single, informing, consciousness as a unifying and unitary vehicle for their poetics—the "well-wrought urn" was a single, static, artifact. The point, I think, is that intention identified with a specific, historical, validating individual (and the citing of this intention as a privileged means of "explaining" the poem) was a contextual embarrassment to the New Critics, but that the New-Critical reliance on cohesion arising from a reconciliation of the multiple ironies in a poetic utterance unavoidably rested upon the unacknowledged concept of an intentionalising consciousness. Thus it was necessary that, for political reasons (a rebuttal of both belletristic and historical criticism) the New Critics had to abhor the ideology of intention while still relying upon the implied consciousness behind it. 5 Perhaps the most unsavoury event (for both sides) in this moral conflict was the recent revelation that one of the founders of deconstruction, Paul de Man, had contributed to a fascist journal during the war years. To the "humanist" critics of post-structuralism, such an historical discovery seemed to vindicate their charge that deconstruction was at best an amoral, anti-humanist enterprise, and at worst, a socially pernicious one. To the deconstructors, this "history" was just another example of the figurative ineluctability of language and perhaps of the basic contradictions that underlie all utterances—including the life of the critic. The debate has not rested, but for a long and measured estimation of the problem, see Jacques Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War," Critical Inquiry , 14 (Spring, 1988), 590-652. 6 Based on his Sandars lectures at Cambridge University (1958), this collection of essays placed the onus for self-education and change clearly on the shoulders of the literary critics. Noting that "We should be seriously disturbed by the lack of contact between literary critics and textual critics" (p. 4), Bowers cites what have become famous examples (by, for example, Matthiessen and Empson) of textual errors—even outright textual misrepresentations—being used by literary critics to promote aesthetic theories which an accurate text would not support. Unfortunately, Bowers' assertion (thirty years ago) that "it is still a current oddity that many a literary critic has investigated the past ownership of and mechanical condition of his second-hand automobile, or the pedigree and training of his dog, more thoroughly than he has looked into the qualifications of the text on which his critical theories rest" (p. 5) is perhaps even more relevant in these post-structuralist days, when an active "misprision" of texts is encouraged by such critics as Harold Bloom. 7 G.

The proceedings (with essays by, for example, Shillingsburg, James L. W. West, Steven Mailloux, Gerald Graff, and response by Greetham) will appear in a special issue of Critical Exchange (1988). The 1987 conference of the Society for Textual Scholarship (9-11 April) included a special session on textual and literary theory ("Where Worlds Collide: The Contact Between Literary Theory and Literary Artifacts"). The 1989 conference of STS (April 6-8) includes three sessions on textual and literary theory—a plenary session with McGann and Jonathan Goldberg, and two member-organized special sessions. 11 For example, the "theoretical" journal Critical Inquiry first published part of chapter 1 of Parker's Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons under the title "Lost Authority: Non-Sense, Skewed Meanings, and Intentionless Meanings," reprinted in Against Theory , ed. W. J. T. Mitchell (1985), pp. 72-79. This collection, which is used later in this essay to provide some of the terms for the theory/empiricism debate, included, appropriately enough, contributions by Hirsch, Mailloux, Fish, and Rorty. Another recent article is John Sutherland's account of "Publishing History: A Hole at the Centre of Literary Sociology," Critical Inquiry , 14 (Spring, 1988), 574-589, a reading of the careers of Robert Darnton, Jerome McGann, and D. F. McKenzie. While the estimation might be salutary for 'critical' readers unused to confronting 'textual' problems, several of Sutherland's assertions (e.g., that McGann is essentially a Marxist) obviously need a fuller debate than is given. In general, 'critical' readers seem concerned with textual issues only when they provoke controversy or contention (e.g., John Kidd's attack on the Gabler Ulysses in The New York Review of Books , 30 June 1988, 32-39). 12 For example, Steven Mailloux, Interpretive Conventions: The Reader in the Study of American Fiction (1982), includes a chapter on "Textual Scholarship and 'Author's Final Intention.'" The example is rare, however, of a critic who is primarily a theorist being concerned about "textual" matters (none of the contributors to Against Theory , for example—with the exception of Parker—raise textual problems). It was, typically, Mailloux who convened the SAMLA session on "Editing and Recent Literary Theory" that occasioned the first version of this present article. 13 See the previous note and the following anecdotal illustration of the problem. At a 1987 Minnesota conference (sponsored by the Modern Language Association and the Ford Foundation) called to determine "the Future of Doctoral Programs in English", Richard Lanham gave what he considered to be a cautionary paper, warning literature departments that new kinds of texts not necessarily reflecting a simple, uniform intention might one day be produced. He (and the other literary theorists on the panel and in the audience—e.g., Wayne Booth, Jonathan Culler) were unaware that such "multiple" texts either already existed or had already been conceived by textual critics. Lanham simply assumed (as Bowers sadly noted of literary critics in 1958) that there had been no advances in textual criticism in the last few decades. During the question period, he conceded that the minatory moment was riper than he had imagined. 14 In the editing of mediaeval texts, for example, there is often the tacit (or expressed) suggestion that recension is the first and major order of business. Alfred Foulet's and Mary B. Speer's On Editing Old French Texts (1979) poses the typical situation: "If the text to be edited has been preserved in three or more manuscripts, the editor should attempt to classify these manuscripts and diagram their relationships by means of a stemma (genealogical tree). The purpose of the stemma is to depict, in graphic form, the affinities of the various manuscripts and their kinship with their lost common ancestor, the archetype" (p. 49). This spare statement assumes that the concept (if not the reality) of "archetype" is always theoretically viable in multi-witness works, and that the establishment of a putative or fixable "kinship" is always a desirable editorial endeavour. Even the radical Kane/Donaldson editions of Piers Plowman (see below) went through the motions of recension before rejecting it, recognising that mediaevalists would have expected the editors to adopt this procedure. (Rarely, indeed, has so much of a textual introduction to a scholarly edition been devoted to describing a process which is not to be followed in the actual editing. But Kane and Donaldson were obviously aware that this gesture was necessary.) In his survey of "ancient editing" ("Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 36 (1983), 21-68, Tanselle notes that editors of older material almost inevitably turn to "transmission" and "genealogy" as the primary task of editing, rather than such "later phases" as the selection or emendation of readings, or the treatment of accidentals. And, in later periods, the well-known public debates on the validity of modernisation of accidentals (between, for example, the American historians and literary editors) or on the applicability of Greg's copy-text theory to non-Renaissance works edited under the CEAA or CSE programs are refreshing in that they have aired disciplinary differences, but illustrative of the tendency of scholars in particular fields of study to make common cause with each other and to institutionalise (the historians through the Association for Documentary Editing) theoretical issues. The current Franco-German move towards the enshrinement of the "texte génétique" in opposition to the earlier hegemony of the Anglo-American eclectic edition (or, in France, of the "best text" school) displays such ideological entrenchments at the national, rather than the disciplinary, level. 15 Two particularly striking recent examples of Tanselle's synthesing coverage include "Historicism and Critical Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 1-46 (reprinted in his Textual Criticism Since Greg [1987], pp. 109-154), and "Bibliographical History as a Field of Study," Studies in Bibliography , 41 (1988), 33-63, the first a thematic and historical survey of recent textual scholarship and the second a history of a history; together they exemplify the role of scholiast and commentator which Tanselle has assumed for the discipline. 16 An exemplary, if anecdotal, illustration of the problem: at the 1987 convention of the Association for Documentary Editing (Boston, 5-7 November), a session on "The Presentation of Manuscript Texts" produced three papers of the "what we did" type (James Buchanan on the Documentary History of the Supreme Court, Peter Drummey on "A Librarian's Point of View", and Ralph Carlson on "Manuscript Facsimiles"—the latter from the publisher's perspective). All were solid, scholarly, and well-documented, and offered in their very variety a series of different professional attitudes to the question of manuscript presentation. But because they had no theoretical underpinning—they were practical "hands-on" accounts—their implications extended only marginally beyond the projects they described. However, Albert von Frank's paper "Genetic Versus Clear Texts" (subsequently published in Documentary Editing , 9, No. 4 [December 1987], 5-9), while it selected its examples from a specific author (Emerson), explored the principles at stake in the decision to produce a genetic or clear text, asserting (for example) that literary critics might be better persuaded of the "poetics of editing" from having to confront a genetic text edition. It is, I believe, something like the Frank approach which Tanselle was describing in his call for a discussion of "the basic issues that we should consider from an interdisciplinary perspective" instead of the presentation of "watered-down versions of what we are already doing in our individual fields", "Presidential Address," TEXT , 1 (1981), 5. 17 W. J. T. Mitchell (ed.), Against Theory (1985), p. 6. 18 In his various writings, Tanselle has repeatedly insisted on the role of critical judgement; perhaps the most direct statement occurs in his short essay on "Textual Scholarship" for the MLA's Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. Joseph Gibaldi (1981), where he argues that [editors'] "work is a critical activity, and a critical edition , by virtue of the textual decisions it contains (and any discussions of those decisions), is also a critical study " (p. 50). It is sadly true, however, that these words are frequently unacceptable institutionally in our profession, for (except for certain noted textual centres such as Toronto or Virginia), academic departments often assign a lesser inherent "value" (and invariably a lesser "critical" status) to editions and works of textual scholarship than to flashier books on criticism and theory. 19 The interdisciplinary science of chaos, developing first in mathematics, but then moving into physics, geology, astronomy, sociology, art history, and economics, has begun to predict new types of constant, new patterns of order, beneath the apparent unpredictability of, for example, the weather, the stock market, and the formation of snow-flakes. Its applicability to textual problems is potentially enormous (e.g., in stylometrics, auctorial accidence, collation and filiation), but, to my knowledge, no textual critics have yet taken advantage of its interdisciplinary implications (see James Gleick, Chaos: Making a New Science [1987]). 20 Geetz suggests that the function of anthropology is "to unpack the layers of meaning in the conceptual world". John Rawls regards the entire body of the law—written and unwritten—as a "text" for moral and epistemological interpretation, with "variants" having significant ethical, cultural, and semiotic value. For a discussion of the interdisciplinary importance of such textual establishment, recording, and interpretation, see W. J. Winkler, "Interdisciplinary Research: How Big a Challenge to Traditional Fields?" in Chronicle of Higher Education , 7 Oct. 1987, 1, 14-15. 21 Rorty's "textualism"—the investigation of any text, legal document, historical paper, or literary work for differential or variant "meaning"—would be one of the studies contained in Scholes's vision of the new university. "I think that the humanities and some of the social sciences are shrinking into one large department. . . . Divisions between, for example, literature and philosophy are not as great as they used to be. It would be very easy, if you didn't have all the traditional department names, to put together a single department—call it a textual department" (cited in Winkler, p. 14). 22 This problem—of our academic colleagues being unfamiliar with, and disdainful of, textual scholarship—is addressed briefly in my article "A Suspicion of Texts," THESIS , 2 (Fall, 1987), 18-25. 23 W. W. Greg, "Bibliography—An Apologia," The Library , 4th. Series, 13 (1932), 121-122. The quotation is, of course, used here as a partial mis representation of Greg's position on theories of meaning and the critical interpretation of intention. However, the same article might be instructive to both formalists and deconstructors, for Greg notes that theoretically "the study of textual transmission involves no knowledge of the sense of a document but only of its form; the document may theoretically be devoid of meaning or the critic ignorant of its language" (p. 122), concluding, therefore, that it might be "a very interesting exercise . . . to edit a text that had no meaning" (p. 123). This sounds like the precepts of extreme defamiliarisation and deconstruction having been anticipated by bibliography, and one might note that the algorithmic mapping employed by Vinton A. Dearing, one of Greg's more ardent "scientific" adherents, uses symbolic logic and a somewhat dense rhetoric in the establishment of the argument for the "principles of parsimony" and "rings" which are to be the vehicles for an essentially non-verbal "textual analysis", displayed with great mathematical rigour but little substantive content. Dearing's Principles and Practice of Textual Analysis (1974) is highly dependent on Greg's algebraic argument, especially his Calculus of Variants . 24 Mailloux, for example, suggests that Hancher-Tanselle's definition of "active intentions" ("active intentions characterize the actions that the author, at the time he finishes the text, understands himself to be performing in that text"—Michael Hancher, "Three Kinds of Intention," MLN , 87 [1972], 830; Tanselle, "Final Intentions," 175) should be redefined to "active intentions characterize the actions that the author, as he writes the text , understands himself to be performing in that text" (p. 97)—a change of focus from product to process that one might expect in a reader-response critic. 25 While Mailloux aligns himself with the "interpretive community" school (and therefore with a reader-response ethic in the text), his analysis of, for example, the rationale given by the editors of the Northwestern-Newberry Melville for having emended nations to matrons (Mailloux, pp. 114-115) relies upon the reader-critic's mind having been subsumed into the consciousness of the author, and is therefore closer to Poulet's suggestion that the reader becomes the author/narrator, than it is to Fish's insistence that the reader creates the author. On Poulet, see below, fn. 49. 26 See especially chapter 3 of the Critique ("The Ideology of Final Intentions"), where McGann claims that the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle line of final intentions is founded on a "Romantic ideology of the relations between an author, his works, his institutional affiliations, and his audience" (p. 42), and cites, in its stead, the position of James Thorpe ( Principles of Textual Criticism [1972], p. 48), that "The work of art is . . . always tending toward a collaborative status." McGann extrapolates from this to declare that "literary works are fundamentally social rather than personal or psychological products . . . . [they] must be produced within some appropriate set of social institutions" (pp. 43-44). 27 Review by T. Davis, Times Literary Supplement , 617 (21 September, 1984), 1058. 28 Indeed, Tanselle ("Textual Scholarship" p. 40 and elsewhere) regards Greg's very choice of terms, especially "accidentals", as "misleading" and "unfortunate" (largely because the division suggests—inaccurately—that accidentals do not contribute to "meaning"). However, the terms have stuck and have, at least in popular usage, come to embody the divided—and differing—authority I cite here. 29 McLaverty, "Intention," esp. p. 124, "Hirsch is much the most important figure [among literary theorists] as far as textual criticism is concerned"—a statement I would question given the wider-ranging compass of my survey. Note, further, that McLaverty suggests that textual critics (who use the word "intention" in its first OED sense—"a volition which one is minded to carry out") may have misappropriated Hirsch, who generally uses "intention" in the second OED sense—"the direction or application of the mind to an object" (122-123). 30 G. Thomas Tanselle, "The Achievement of Fredson Bowers," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 79 (1985), 3-18, esp. p. 13 (of Bibliography and Textual Criticism ), "One might perhaps take from it (once again) the conclusion that bibliographers are historians, confronting the same problem that all historians face: how to weigh the preserved evidence in order to reconstruct past events." 31 See, for example, Hershel Parker, "The 'New Scholarship': Textual Evidence and Its Implications for Criticism, Literary Theory, and Aesthetics," Studies in American Fiction , 9 (1981), 181-197. 32 The slogan of Husserl's phenomenology, "Back to the Things Themselves!" suggests the concrete, historical, value of this stage of the theory. As a science of consciousness, early phenomenology seemed to provide for the mind the objectivity which historical critics sought in the event —hence its importance to the theoretical discussion of textual intentionality and historicism. See Edmund Husserl, The Idea of Phenomenology (1964). 33 While Gadamer uses Heidegger's rejection of Husserl's "objectivist" view in the study of literary theory ( Truth and Method [1960]), he does allow that the varying levels of intention are just as much a part of the "historical" situation as is interpretation. Different aspects of both Gadamer's and Heidegger's reflexive stance between Historie (objective "events") and Geschichte (meaning-full narrative) can, of course, be employed to place them on a linear development from "historicity" to "reception". 34 See Hans Robert Jauss, Toward an Aesthetic of Reception , tr. T. Bahti (1982) and especially "Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory," in Ralph Cohen, ed., New Directions in Literary History (1974), pp. 11-41. 35 Jauss, "The Alterity and Modernity of Medieval Literature," New Literary History , 10 (1979), 181-227. 36 For example, in rejecting ( Critique , p. 112) Tanselle's claim that regularizing and modernizing are "ahistorical" ("Every literary production is ahistorical in the sense of Tanselle's usage"), McGann asserts that Tanselle's limited view of an immediate historicity "does not recognize the historical dimension of all literary productions, including modernized editions, and so forth" (p. 112). Like Gadamer, McGann sees history not as specifically local to the author, but as a continuum on which later (even modernized) editions, even editions showing the collaboration of later hands, can be plotted in a linear extrapolation of "authority" and "meaning". Tanselle and McGann both appeal to history, but their appeal reflects two very different ideological assumptions. 37 See Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), esp. 339-340, for the argument that "[m]ost authors even today expect the printer to normalize their spelling and capitalization", that "the actual writing of the manuscript . . . is a means of composition, not an end", and that, unless the work was not intended for publication at all (e.g., letters, diaries) or unless the editor can prove that the "author disapproved of the printer's normalization", then the first edition will normally best represent "the text the author wanted to . . . be read". Thus, Thorpe, with his support of the "collaborative" nature of literary composition (see fn. 26), and Gaskell, with his removal of intention from manuscript to print, can both be invoked by textual and literary critics desirous of diluting the authority of author and original intention. But Thorpe and Gaskell are still basically historicists. 38 For a wide-ranging consideration of the literary and linguistic nature of defamiliarisation, see R. H. Stacy, Defamiliarization in Language and Literature (1977). 39 James Joyce, Ulysses , ed. Hans Walter Gabler with Wolfhard Steppe and Claus Melchior, 3v. (1984). Tanselle ("Historicism and Critical Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 39 [1986]) argues that there is a methodological distinction to be made between genetic and synoptic texts: "A genetic text aims to show the development of the text or texts present in a single document by providing a running text that indicates cancellations, interlineations, and other alterations. Gabler's synoptic text, on the other hand, aims to bring together in a single running text the authorial readings from all relevant documents. The symbols in the synoptic text, therefore, have to serve two functions: to indicate (as in a genetic text) the status of alterations within documents and also (as the sigla in a list do) to identify the various source documents and show their sequence. Furthermore, the synoptic text contains editorial emendations, for it is concerned only with authorial revisions, not with "corruptions"—which are therefore to be corrected and recorded 'in the type of subsidiary apparatus best suited to the purpose, i.e., an appended lemmatised emendation list'" (fn. 72, 38-39). Tanselle draws an important practical distinction here for the specific problems of the Gabler edition, but it is a distinction which is not automatically inherent to synoptic and genetic texts. For example, it is surely possible to envisage a so-called "genetic" text which does cite variants from several documents, and to imagine a "synoptic" text without editorial emendation, or one in which non-auctorial historical collation were also included (this latter question has, indeed, been one of the main contentions between Gabler and some of his critics—see fn. 50). Louis Hay, in his study of genetic texts in general (see fn. 9), describes works (including the Gabler Ulysses ) which are extant in more than one document. The important point for the present discussion is that both synoptic and/or genetic texts represent structural "layers" of text, document, and "meaning": as Hay puts it—"the stress is no longer on the author's intentions but on the structure of the text; the whole set of permutations of variants is taken into account with all its potential for textual filiation and convergence; and synoptic display assumes its position alongside lemmatized listings, or 'steps'" p. 119). 40 For an account of the Lachmann system, see S. Timpanaro, Die Entstehung der Lachmannschen Methode (1971), rev. transl. of La genesi del metodo del Lachmann (1963). See also the more recent estimations in E. J. Kenney, The Classical Text (1974), esp. pp. 98-112, and Paul Oskar Kristeller, "The Lachmann Method: Merits and Limitations," TEXT , 1 (1981), 11-20. 41 McGann's "schematic history" (chapter 1 of the Critique ) of modern textual criticism draws a direct line of descent from Lachmannism to Greg-Bowers intentionalism: [of Bowers' treatment of Hawthorne]—"though the textual problems are far removed from those faced by Lachmann, the influence of the classical approach is clear" (p. 20); [of Bowers' "theory of a critical edition"]: "Bowers's views, then, continue to show the influence of the textual criticism developed in the field of classical studies" (p. 21). McGann does note that the usual "monogenous" textual history of, e.g., Shakespeare versus the "polygenous" transmission of classical literature required "some adjustments of the Lachmann Method by Shakespearean scholars" (p. 17), and that the problem of final intention was a "third area" added by modern textual critics to the two "classical" problems of the critical edition and the copy-text (p. 23); but McGann's enlistment of Lachmannism as a precursor of "Greg-Bowersism" stresses a continuity which is, in my view, chimerical, and does not delineate between classical and modern (Greg-Bowers) textual criticism in the appropriate theoretical terms. The distinction between, on the one hand, the Lachmannians' (and especially the post-Lachmannians') acceptance of the corrupt arche-type and consequent avoidance of intention as a theoretical issue and, on the other, the Bowers-Tanselle concentration on "intention" as a motivating force for textual criticism is a distinction between a structuralist and a "writer-based" theory. Editors of classical authors may have talked a good deal about "stripping away" the "corruptions" of textual transmission (see Kenney, p. 25 for some account of the prevalent metaphor of emaculare in classical textual scholarship), but stemmatic theory—because of its fundamental text-based structuralism—never achieved the relative writer-based certitude of the modern intentionalists. Housman (see fn. 46, and his prefaces to Manilius) saw the conceptual limitations of the post-Lachmannian archetype, which effectively placed him closer to the intentionalists than to the structuralists). 42 It is the difference which creates the opposition, so that "on" is "on" precisely because it is not "off". This is a directly comparable operation to the Lachmannians' conceptual—and methodological—distinction of difference between "text" and "variant", "truth" and "error", and creates, like structuralist anthropology, linguistics, and poetics, a "grammar" of meaning, all produced by the wide applicability of the relationships discovered as a result of these oppositions. See, e.g., Roland Barthes, Mythologies (1957), Elements of Semiology (1967), Ferdinand de Saussure, Course in General Linguistics (tr. 1974), Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics, and the Study of Literature (1975), Claude Lévi-Strauss, Structuralist Anthropology (tr. 1968). 43 See Joseph Bédier, "La Tradition manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre : reflexions sur l'art d'editer les anciens textes," Romania , 54 (1928), 161-196, 321-356, repr. as pamphlet, 1970. 44 See esp.

I. Fennell, "Textology as a Key to the Study of Old Russian Literature and History," TEXT 1 (1981), 157-166; on geneticism see Hay (fn. 9 and 39), Jean-Louis Lebrave, "Rough Drafts: A Challenge to Uniformity in Editing," TEXT , 3 (1986), 135-142, and Hans Zeller, "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," Studies in Bibliography , 28 (1975), 231-263 and Zeller and Gunter Martens' Texte und Variationen. Probleme ihrer Edition und Interpretation (1971). 48 That is, a clear text can be thought of as embodying "final intentions" only , and the synoptic text similarly looked on as showing the "growth" of an artist's mind. Such a relationship would suggest that phenomenology can lead (methodologically, at least) to intentionalism, rather than vice versa. Tanselle ("Historicism" p. 39) asks the pertinent question (of Gabler's synoptic and clear texts): "But why, one is bound to ask, should there be a separate 'reading' text if all the variants are an essential part of the work? Why should 'the object of scholarly and critical analysis and study' (which is the 'totality of the Work in Progress') be seen as 'opposed' to 'a general public's reading matter'?" I share Tanselle's unease, but I offer in this paper two different theoretical grounds for looking at synoptic and clear texts which might provide an answer to the question. 49 That is, Poulet's insistence that the phenomenologist is "thinking the thoughts of another" might seem to be exemplified textually by the reversals, changes of mind, ellipses, and intellectual detours charted by the genetic text. But this is so only if the genetic text is used to recover intention (e.g., in a clear text)—a somewhat problematic assertion, as Hay and Zeller note (see fn. 39). Georges Poulet, "Criticism and the Experience of Interiority," tr. Catherine Macksey, in Reader-Response Criticism , ed. Jane P. Tompkins (1980), p. 44. 50 That is, the synoptic apparatus becomes the focus of the reading, not the clear text, which is seen as a mere "concession" to readability. The function of the synoptic apparatus (and in fact any critical apparatus sufficiently dense and clear) is to display a series of "on/off" or "truth/error" switches: each time a variant is cited, it can be cited precisely because it is not a different one. The structuralist analysis (i.e., x ≠ y) of multiple-witness texts would, of course, be an enormously complex enterprise, since each variant would need to be charted independently and in every possible relationship with every other, but it is not dissimilar to the principle of distributional analysis championed by Dom Henri Quentin and others. If the synoptic apparatus does contain all variants (with no separate historical collation for non-auctorial variants), then it could indeed represent that "universe of the text" which the structuralists sought. In the case of the Gabler Ulysses , there is apparently some question whether the distinction between auctorial and non-auctorial variants, and their respective placing in the synoptic apparatus or the historical collation, has been perfectly observed. John Kidd's New York Review article (fn. 11) asserts (as only a part of his general attack on the methodology, scholarship, and ideology of the Gabler edition) that the division of authority between authorial and non-authorial variants is imperfect or blurred in the synoptic edition (and that there is at times a conflation, or a confusion, of intention and structuralism—although he does not use those precise terms). The case awaits further debate, with a fuller account of Kidd's findings in PBSA . 51 I.e., a reduction of literary genre to its inherent structural form —a series of relationships deriving from absolute or invariable models outside the work. One of the inevitable criticisms of such an approach is that the imposition of a universal system, often inherited from folklorists like Propp, does not allow for a distinction between, say, Verdi's Otello , Shakespeare's Othello , or the Italian sources (Cinthio/Ariosto), since they all display similar "syntagms" (narrative segments) yielding similar structural features even though they are in different genres. Despite its concentration on "difference", structuralism is paradoxically often more concerned with similitudes, especially formal ones. For a critique of the major North American proto-structuralist of literary genre, Northrop Frye, and his The Anatomy of Criticism (1957), see Frank Lentricchia, After the New Criticism (1980), pp. 3-26. 52 See the post-structuralist style of Barthes' work (represented comparatively early by the dissolution of structuralist system in S/Z [1970]), where Balzac's novel Sarrasine is first reduced (according to structuralist linguistics) into its basic titular phoneme s/z (unvoiced/voiced sibilant), and then into 561 lexias (or reading units), whereby the realistic novel is dismembered into a series of elemental, ambivalent units, each one susceptible to independent "reading", and each capable of bearing a different and changing relation to the others. 53 Derek Pearsall, for example, grants a particular privilege to this variety in composition, when he accords special value to those Chaucerian manuscripts "where scribal editors have participated most fully in the activity of a poem, often at a high level of intellectual and even creative engagement." "Editing Medieval Texts," in Jerome J. McGann, ed., Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation (1985), p. 105. 54 See Roman Ingarden, The Literary Work of Art (1931), where it is argued that all texts display "indeterminacies" or "gaps" which can be filled, to form a completed "harmony" for the work, by the reader's active employment of "schemata" —the patterns of understanding derived from a careful critical engagement with the authority of the work. The same argument—of a gradually acquired "familiarity" with textual and auctorial usage being the editorial determinant for successful emendation and filling of lacunae —has, of course, often sustained a critical, eclectic, edition. 55 Wolfgang Iser, The Art of Reading: A Theory of Aesthetic Response (1978) allows the reader to make use of the "strategies" or "repertoires" redolent but not immediate in a work, and by continuous negotiation with the resultant "networks" or matrixes, to achieve a phenomenological wholeness of understanding. It was just such a wholeness of understanding which the Alexandrians sought, and by roughly similar intellectual processes. 56 For an account of analogy and the Alexandrians, see J. E. Sandys, History of Classical Scholarship , 3v. (1908, repr. 1958), and Rudolph Pfeiffer, The History of Classical Scholarship , 2v. (1968-76). 57 Kane-Donaldson's desire for a "perfect" line (criticised in David C. Fowler's review-essay "A New Edition of the B Text of Piers Plowman ," The Yearbook of English Studies , 7 [1977], 23-42, a review of Piers Plowman: The B Version. . . . An Edition in the Form of Trinity College MS B. 15. 17 . . . . ed. George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson [1975]) could perhaps be regarded as a phenomenological "completion" of the auctorial consciousness. However, Fowler's strictures (and Kane/ Donaldson's clear awareness of the un-documentary license they were taking) lead me to place this important—and highly contentious—edition on a cusp leading into a post-structuralist dispensation, where "meaning" is not simply a matter of the completion, but (where it exists consistently at all) is ephemeral, local, and negotiated most productively in a text which, like Piers Plowman , is overtly scriptible (that is, a text which is not closed or final or "readerly"— lisible —but open-ended, productive, and elusive). In fact, this latter description of the inherent characteristics of Piers Plowman would seem, from its textual history, to have been shared by the extremely creative, and inventive, scribes who participated in its transmission. The ambivalence over the placing of this text and this particular edition in our matrix simply confirms that the divisions of current literary and textual theory are not absolute, and that one dispensation may gradually slide into another. The careers of such protean theorists as J. Hillis Miller and Jonathan Culler exemplify this tendency. 58 I am aware that Professor McGann might reject the idea that he founded a "school" of textual criticism with the Critique (and he has continually to struggle against literary and textual critics' having erroneously co-opted or misappropriated his ideas), but there can be little denying the wide influence of his slim book. Like it or not, "social textual criticism"—after McGann's enunciation of its principles— is now a major focus for debate, some of it contentious. 59 See Heidegger, Being and Time (tr. 1962) and fn. 33. 60 See fns. 33 and 34. 61 E. D. Hirsch, Validity in Interpretation (1976). As noted above, Hirsch distinguishes between "significance", which can vary in history, and "meaning", which is invariable and is "put" into the work by the author's intention—it is a willed quality in the work. The critic (and reader) discovers this meaning (according to Hirsch) by continually narrowing the "intrinsic genre" of the text, down to units which are apprehensible and absolute. Hirsch's theory is thus as much an ideology of genre as it is of intention. 62 Bakhtin's insistence on "polyphony"—multiple and subjective voices in the battle over meaning, together with his rejection of the univocal, organic, and integrated meaning of the Formalists, accords well with McGann's similar rejection of a monodic intentionalism and an espousal of historical multiplicity. See Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics (tr. 1973), and (with P. N. Medvedev) The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship (tr. 1978). 63 "Administration Trolling for Constitutional Debate," The New York Times (28 October, 1985), p. A12. 64 Ackerman began his investigation of Fish's method as an analog for constitutional history while a professor in the Yale Law School. Later moving to Columbia (and now back to Yale), his collaboration with Fish was more direct (particularly since Fish himself had begun to publish in law journals, and was beginning to read legal history from an "affective" point of view). Ackerman's study of constitutional history through reception theory is (I believe) still forthcoming. 65 The reader's "play" in the text is best exemplified in Barthes' The Pleasures of the Text (1975), where jouissance is whatever exceeds a simple, unambiguous meaning. The Derridean jeu —punning, figurative, non-denotative play in and on language—can be seen in his critical terms as well as in the substance of his writing (e.g., différance —from "differ" and "defer", a "resultant difference" which can not be heard in French, but only read). As a perfect example of his "play" in argument, see his reduction of his rival the Speech Act theoretician Searle to SARL ("Société à responsibilité limitée) in Limited Inc abc (1977). 66 See Steven Urkowitz, Shakespeare's Revision of King Lear (1980), E. A. J. Honigmann's The Stability of Shakespeare's Text (1965), and Michael Warren and Gary Taylor, eds., The Division of the Kingdoms (1983). 67 Parker produces examples of "maimed" texts in Norman Mailer, Henry James, Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, and others, claiming that the typical circumstances of composition, censorship, publication and revision in American fiction of the period created texts which are inconsistent and "unreadable". 68 "Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself." J. Hillis Miller, "Steven's Rock and Criticism as Cure, II", Georgia Review , 30 (1976). 69 Examples of the reflexive (and irreconcilable) contradictions introduced into the revised versions of American fiction include, according to Parker, the excision of the encounter with the huge fat man in Crane's Maggie , the "unjoined" twins in Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson , and the change in the character of Stephen Richards Rojack in Mailer's An American Dream . Parker's general position is that such indeterminacies are so widespread that they can collectively be brought together as a theory of fiction (or at least American fiction of the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries). Tanselle ("Historicism", pp. 27-36) finds the generalisation implausible, and notes that, despite Parker's apparent endorsement of auctorial intention, he has in effect moved the aesthetic prerogative to the editor, or (as I would hold, claiming Parker as a deconstructor) to the reader. 70 Tanselle: "I am always impatient with persons who ask, upon hearing a theoretical statement which is clearly undeniable, how often it proves to be relevant in practice—as if the quantity of such occurrences has anything to do with the validity of the statement."

      <field name="heading_text">Reproductions and Scholarship by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Parker Winship, reporting in 1913 on the activities of the John Carter Brown Library during the preceding year, said, "A purchase which has had an unexpected influence upon the development of the Library is that of a mechanical photographing machine." It may be hard for us now to imagine how the role of photocopying—once a process for it was readily available—could ever have been "unexpected," for the present academic world is a place that Gore Vidal has with justice called "Xerox-land." 1 Many, perhaps most, scholars in the humanities today would say that the widespread access to inexpensive copying facilities has transformed—for the better— their manner of working. Some have even been heard to name the Xerox Corporation along with two or three inspiring teachers or seminal thinkers in their field as the dominant influences on the way their own work has developed. Although few voices have been raised in complaint, the advent of cheap photocopying is not an unmixed blessing. One of the pejorative implications of Vidal's phrase is obviously that photocopying has enabled scholars increasingly to pack away endless bits of information without digesting it. Unquestionably for some scholars the act of placing material in a file gives them a sense of control over their subject matter; and a bulging file of xerographic copies is likely to provide them greater satisfaction than the smaller file of supposedly less reliable hand-written or typewritten notes that could have been produced in the same amount of time (even though the latter would at least have necessitated reading the material). But there have always been scholars who do not know how to make constructive use of their accumulated data and others who clearly do know how: the ubiquity of copying machines does not change that. In any case, the disturbing aspect of Xerox-land that I wish to address is quite different, but equally fundamental: the total lack of understanding of the nature of documentary evidence that is exhibited by most scholars in their use of photocopies. Even so thoughtful a bibliographical and historical scholar as Winship could say in that 1913 report, "The machine does accurately and more quickly what the human copyist transcribes with constant likelihood of error." 2 Winship would certainly have understood that photography is not error-free, but he chose not to weaken his enthusiastic endorsement of the new machine by mentioning any of its limitations. Later commentators, speaking both of photocopying a few pages and of microfilming entire books, have usually taken the same line, though we may be less inclined in many instances to believe that any reservations had occurred to them. One outspoken critic, however, was William A. Jackson, who addressed the Bibliographical Society of America in 1941 on "Some Limitations of Microfilm." He began by asserting that there is really nothing to say except that "microfilms are microfilms and not the original book or manuscript, and [I could] then sit down, my case being stated, and allow the implications of that statement to be worked out by each one of you according to your own experience." But, he added, "I am down for fifteen minutes and so I shall employ the rest of them in elaborating this point." 3 He was right that nothing more ought to need saying; but I, too, shall make some further comments, not because I have an allotted number of minutes or pages to fill but because so many people behave as if they do not understand the differences between reproductions and originals. I shall be speaking specifically of reproductions of documents (manuscript or printed sheets or books) containing verbal texts, but the points I shall make are of course applicable to documents containing musical or dance-notational texts as well, and they are further applicable to reproductions of works of visual art. 4 When I use the word "reproduction" (and, more loosely, "photocopy," "photofacsimile," and so on), I mean the product of any chemical or electrostatic process that aims to represent with exactness (though perhaps on an enlarged or diminished scale) not only the text of a given document but also the details of its presentation, insofar as they can be duplicated on a different surface. Sometimes—in the past more than now—the text of a printed document is reset in the same typeface as the original and with spacing and lineation intended to imitate the original, and the result is called a "type-facsimile"; 5 but such a "facsimile" is not a reproduction as here defined because it involves a new typesetting. Most people, I believe, recognize why this kind of "facsimile" cannot be regarded as the equivalent of the original, whereas they frequently do not see why the same is true of photographic and xerographic copies. I should like to explore both the practical and the theoretical reasons for maintaining that reproductions are not substitutes for originals and then examine a few prominent recent instances of confusion on this point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The bulk of the writing about microfilms and other photocopies of manuscript and printed material (and there is a considerable literature of the subject) 6 does not allude to the possibility of inaccurate or misleading reproduction. Indeed, what is often stressed is the absolute fidelity of photographic copies. For example, Charles F. McCombs, in his widely circulated pamphlet The Photostat in Reference Work (first published in 1920), 7 speaks of the "unlimited possibilities" of photostats because of "the advantages of an absolutely accurate copy" (p. 4), a copy "free from errors and omissions to which the most careful copyist or typist is at times liable" (p. 5). The next year the Bibliographical Society of America devoted a whole issue of its Papers to the subject of "Photographic Copying" (the title on the cover label, though the primary topic was the photostat), and in the course of 53 pages 8 there are only two brief references to any limitations of photocopies: Henrietta C. Bartlett is quoted as saying that the photostat "should not be considered of equal value to the student with the original" (p. 15), and in the discussion of the acceptance of photostats in court "Mr. Winship and others spoke of the possibility of altering or faking photostat copies" (p. 50). Otherwise it is all praise, far less perceptive bibliographically than one would expect in the publication of a bibliographical society. Thus George Watson Cole (Huntington Library), in his survey of "valuable and interesting . . . information" from the responses to a questionnaire, quotes Frederick W. Cook (Archives Division, Commonwealth of Massachusetts) as saying that "the machine makes no mistakes" (p. 5); Alexander J. Wall (New-York Historical Society) writes in his reply that "photostat reproductions answer every purpose for the student of American history and we bind them the same as any pamphlet and treat them as an original publication in their classification" (p. 10); James Thayer Gerould (Princeton University Library) says, "In many cases the photograph is more satisfactory for the scholar's use than the original" (p. 11); and Cole, in his concluding remarks, states as a fact that a photostat "requires no reading back" to check it for accuracy (p. 16). Such blind faith in the virtues of photography, on the part of those who should know better, has continued. Keyes D. Metcalf reported uncritically in 1938, "It is generally conceded that it [microphotography] will be used extensively by librarians in the place of the original of books and MSS." He added, even more astonishingly, that in photographs "books and MSS. which could not otherwise be found in libraries will become available and may be studied from a bibliographical point of view"—and this statement (like the ones cited by Cole earlier) appeared in the journal of the Bibliographical Society of America. 9 A quarter-century later the same journal published a piece by Richard W. Hale, Jr., who took as his starting point "the simple thought that a photographic reproduction of bibliographical information is textually trustworthy." 10 In between, Library Trends published an article by Herman H. Fussler implying that microfilm eliminates the necessity of seeing the original: it "permits the historian in Athens, Georgia, for example, to have access, without leaving Athens, to an important collection of manuscripts in the Bancroft Library at the University of California. The cost is clearly less than that of going to California to consult the originals (unless the number of manuscripts required is very large)." 11 And James G. Hodgson, in an early pamphlet on xerography (which, its subtitle predicts, "may be a tool of great importance to libraries"), welcomed the process by asserting that "the final form is a very exact reproduction of the original." 12 There is no need to multiply examples, for everyone knows that such statements abound—though it is disturbing to find that at least one bibliographical society and several rare-book librarians (on whom one might expect to rely for carefully considered views on this subject) have endorsed the common belief that photocopies do not lie. The reasons for being suspicious of reproductions have not gone entirely unexpressed, however; and one should not be surprised that the essential points were made at a meeting of the London Bibliographical Society as early as the mid-1920s. The March 1926 number of the Library , which prints the papers delivered at the December 1925 meeting and a summary of the ensuing discussion, 13 contains two statements that together make the primary case against reproductions and suggest how copies may appropriately be used. W. W. Greg, in his paper, said simply that "no process but in some measure obscures what it reproduces" (p. 321). And the president of the Society, Frederick George Kenyon, said in the discussion that photographic copies "should be regarded not as substitutes for the originals, but as approximations only helpful in suggesting points which must subsequently be verified" (p. 327). A decade later the Bibliographical Society published, as the tenth of the Supplements to its journal, R. B. Haselden's Scientific Aids for the Study of Manuscripts (1935), which was considered the standard treatment of its subject in the years that followed. Because the book is largely concerned with the examination of the physical characteristics of manuscripts, it naturally begins from the premise that one is studying the originals; but Haselden does say explicitly, in his chapter on photography, "No authoritative conclusion regarding a manuscript can be based on the examination of any known form of reproduction thereof; the original must always be consulted" (p. 70). Six years later came W. A. Jackson's forceful paper, mentioned above, asserting flatly that "no photograph can take the place of the original" (p. 287). In the next decade Jerry McDonald's "The Case against Microfilming," 14 although it deals with the filming of business firms' archives (and partly from the economic point of view), 15 makes many of the points that one would have to make in evaluating the reliability of film for scholarly research: McDonald comments on the necessity for "inspecting" microfilms (by which he implies collation and spot-checking for legibility, if not full proofreading), the loss of detail in them, the drawbacks of not seeing colors or embossings, the errors produced by fluctuations in the electric current supplied to microfilming machines, and the distortions produced by variations in the temperature of the places where microfilms are stored. In 1961 Laurence A. Cummings, writing on "Pitfalls of Photocopy Research," 16 added to this catalogue of problems: photographers omit material through oversight or the assumption that it could not be significant enough for the customer to wish to pay for; 17 pictures may not be in sharp focus if the leaf photographed does not lie flat or if adjustments are not made when the lens-image distance shifts because of the thickness of the book being photographed; and erasures, show-through from the reverse side of a leaf, uneven surfaces, and spots on the paper or on the lens all can cause photographs to be misleading. 18 Cummings concludes, "any serious editorial work based on examination of microfilms, photostats, and other reproductions without first-hand consulting of the original must be tentative. The camera lens cannot replace the scholar's eye." The word "editorial" could be omitted from this statement, of course, because the problems enumerated would affect any serious work, whether textual or not. The same point could be made about a 1968 comment of Franklin B. Williams, Jr.: "no one questions the principle that an editor must work finally with the originals." 19 For "an editor" one could substitute "all serious readers"—though the idea that "no one" questions such a statement, or even the more limited original one, is far from being literally true (the phrase really means "no one who has thought the matter through with logical rigor"). Williams has provided the best historical survey of the production of facsimiles of pre-1641 English books, 20 accompanying it with what he calls a "cautionary" listing of photofacsimiles and indicating many instances of faulty reproductions, ranging from those based on defective copies to those that mistake type-facsimiles for originals. Most of the criticisms of reproductions, including some of those just cited, have focused on specific examples, and it is worth mentioning several of them here to suggest the kinds of problems that actually occur. One large class of problems consists of errors arising in the planning or production of photocopies. Sometimes such mistakes are inadvertent, but at other times they result from misguided attempts to be helpful by tampering with the images. Instances of the former are the omission of the dedication leaf from the 1931 Country Life facsimile of Tusser's Good Husbandry (reported by Williams) and that of the last page of text from the Garland facsimile of William Biggs's Narrative (reported by David Vander Meulen). Besides omitting material, reproductions can also present material in incorrect order: Glenn H. Blayney reports that the Huntington Library microfilm of A Yorkshire Tragedy presents the facing pages B3 v /B4 r where A3 v /A4 r ought to be (and vice versa)—because it was made from photostats, not directly from the original, and two of the photostats got switched. Williams calls attention to the use of Smeeton's type-facsimile of Kyd's Solimon and Perseda and Ashbee's hand-traced facsimile of Jack Jugeler , rather than the originals, as the bases for Farmer's collotype facsimiles of these titles; and he notes that Farmer's collotype of Rastell's Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte reproduces the British Library copy without indicating that four leaves in that copy are in type-facsimile, just as the Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints series includes, without notice, a pen-facsimile title page in its reproduction of Palladis Tamia . The 1977 Arno Press facsimile of Donne's Biathanatos represents a compounding of errors (discovered by Ernest W. Sullivan II): it reproduces not the original but Hebel's 1930 facsimile (for the Facsimile Text Society), which in turn incorporated opaquing (to eliminate show-through) that wiped out more than a hundred punctuation marks (some of which were replaced by pen). 21 The intentional creation of errors by opaquing and retouching is widespread. Of course, those responsible do not think of themselves as creating errors; but if a facsimile purports to represent an original as closely as possible, any alteration that removes distracting marks present in the original (as opposed to those introduced by the camera lens or the surface of the copying machine) produces by definition an error—to say nothing of the inadvertent erasures that often accompany any cleaning up. One of the most famous examples of what opaquing is likely to lead to is the 1954 Yale facsimile of the First Folio of Shakespeare, which contains an errata list in its second printing and some restored readings in its third and which, as Fredson Bowers reported in his thorough review, contains an enormous number of additional errors, especially erasures of line-end punctuation. Colin McKelvie's 1976 facsimile of the Armagh Public Library copy of Gulliver's Travels (for Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints) contains, as Donald Greene has shown, alterations that go beyond erasures in the reproductions of pages with manuscript revisions in what may be Swift's hand: on one page of the original, "Red" and "Green" are entered side by side in the margin, whereas in the facsimile "Red" appears below "Green"; on another page the marginal words "Horn and Crown" are much reduced in size from the original; and on a third a large blot in the original is replaced by a seemingly hand-lettered "and" in the facsimile. The first two changes were made because the leaf size of the facsimile would not otherwise have accommodated the annotation (and there are instances of marginal notes that do not show up at all); the third was made on the assumption that the blot was accidental, though it was arguably Swift's way of deleting the "and". Greene concludes, "It is clear that with a little judicious airbrushing and a sharp pen, and photographic enlargement and reduction, a 'facsimile' can be made to say the thing that is not." That facsimiles, like other printed books, can vary from one printing to another is illustrated not only by the Yale Folio but by the Scolar Press reproduction of Pope's 1729 Dunciad Variorum : in the first printing of this facsimile (1966) two superscript footnote letters are properly present on pages 14-15, but in the second printing (1968) a thorough cleaning of marginal spots has taken away these letters. David Vander Meulen has found still other instances of tampering in this facsimile: the errata leaf is placed in its conventional position at the end of the book, although it occurs in a different location in the British Library copy, which the facsimile claims to reproduce; three blank leaves are inserted without comment, apparently to mark divisions, where the original has none; and the pages bearing ornaments or plates are slightly enlarged, suggesting that they may have been produced by a different process. 22 If all such intentional and inadvertent departures from the originals constitute one category of problems that reproductions present, the other large category consists of those instances in which reproductions that cannot be called inaccurate are nevertheless misleading. There are many places in manuscripts, for example, that cannot be properly interpreted unless the various inks or pencils involved can be distinguished and unless the marks that have bled through a sheet from the other side can be recognized for what they are. Yet most reproductions do not offer a broad enough range of gradation in tone to make such discriminations possible; and frequently the photographic adjustments necessary to make the faintest inscriptions show up cause distortion in the heavier inscriptions. Almost everyone who has ever used reproductions of manuscripts is likely to have misinterpreted them at one point or another, either by thinking something is illegible when it is not or by investing something with an unwarranted significance. We should not be surprised when Jerry McDonald says that "the chief engineer's 'hen scratchings' are much easier to decipher in the original than they are on film" (p. 348), or when Laurence Cummings reports that what he thought were Sir Walter Ralegh's initials in a Renaissance manuscript examined on film turned out to be "a few random pen scratches and an interesting pattern of wrinkles" (p. 101). A prominent instance of scholarly work vitiated (among other reasons) by reliance on photocopies that exhibit such problems is Hans Walter Gabler's edition of Joyce's Ulysses . John Kidd has demonstrated that time after time the errors in Gabler's text can be explained by comparing the published facsimiles in The James Joyce Archive (1978-79) with the originals. Gabler prints "Captain Culler" at a point where Joyce's inscription on a surviving proof sheet clearly reads "Captain Buller", presumably because the high-contrast reproduction in The James Joyce Archive makes a printer's pencil mark at this spot look something like a "C". At another point on a surviving proof, Joyce wrote "crême de la crême" in ink, and at a later stage the circumflexes were changed in blue pencil to grave accents; Gabler does not report the circumflexes, which in the facsimile are hidden by the heavy pencil marks. Kidd shows the considerable significance of these particular misreadings for interpretation, but even those of less importance demonstrate the point that facsimiles can be misleading. It is crucial for studying the development of Joyce's text to distinguish two types of black-lead pencil as well as the colors of both ink and lead markings; but the facsimiles do not permit such identification, and it is not provided by Gabler—though he does try to record erasures and inevitably misses many and invents others. Kidd concludes that the Gabler edition "is a study not of Joyce's manuscripts but of inadequate facsimiles." 23 Reproductions of printed material can be equally misleading. Sometimes light inking or worn spots on a printed page cause type impressions not to show up at all in reproductions, and such reproductions can then give rise to the belief that variants exist where in fact there are none. Williams mentions that three facsimiles of the 1597 Richard III show no paragraph sign beginning the imprint because they used the Devonshire (now Huntington) copy, in which the title page is worn and the paragraph sign faint. Sometimes type impressions, like handwriting, are unclear even in the original, and a facsimile interposes yet another barrier in the way of interpreting such ambiguous spots. A case in point is William Biggs's Narrative (cited in another connection above): the title-page date is unclear (1825 or 1826), particularly so in the Newberry Library copy used for the Garland facsimile, in which the volume is identified as representing an 1825 edition. Uncritical users of this facsimile will assume that the 1825 date has been definitely established and that the indistinct date on the title page probably reflects a flaw in the photography, whereas in truth this book is regularly catalogued (following Cecil K. Byrd's A Bibliography of Illinois Imprints, 1814-58 [1966]) as from 1826. An even more common situation is that reproductions of printed matter are misleading because the copy chosen is defective or contains variants that make it a poor representative of an edition as a whole. According to Ernest Sullivan, the Hebel facsimile of Biathanatos is based on "a probably unique and textually suspect copy"; and Franklin Williams discovered that the title-page date is missing from the Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints reproduction of The Beggars Ape because it was made from the British Library copy, which is cropped. Rollo Silver has reported that the Readex Microprint reproduction of the first English Bible printed in America was apparently made from an imperfect copy that does not contain the Congressional resolutions authorizing the printing. And Charlyne Dodge describes a photocopy of Harold Frederic's "Preface to a Uniform Edition" in In the Sixties (1897) that fails to show Frederic's initials at the end because it was made from a copy that had been printed on a torn sheet: the flap created by the tear was turned back during printing so that one of the initials fell on it and one struck the hole; when the flap was later put in place, no initials therefore appeared on the recto (and one askew initial was on the verso). Without seeing the original one would have no way of knowing that this photocopy of the "Preface" does not represent a variant state or impression. This printing error is unusual, but the lesson it teaches applies to every use of a reproduction. 24</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II These examples show a few of the ways in which erroneous and misleading reproductions occur. Clearly it is difficult to imagine a situation so far-fetched that it cannot be seriously considered as the cause for one or another problematic photocopy. Accidents do happen, and reproductions do mislead. Everyone knows that; and everyone knows (though many people act as if they do not know) that every form of reproduction can lie, by providing a range of possibilities for interpretation that is different from the one offered by the original. What is less well understood is that even if the production of copies were always accurately handled and even if the reproductions themselves were never distorted or misleading in their representation of the originals, they would still be unsatisfactory. The reciting of examples is actually irrelevant, because even if no one had ever found any problem in any previous reproduction, there would still be no reason to trust reproductions or to let them serve as substitutes for originals. The essential fact one must come back to is that every reproduction is a new document, with characteristics of its own, and no artifact can be a substitute for another artifact. This point is more widely recognized in some fields than in others; as far as verbal compositions are concerned, many people think that the words can easily be transferred from one physical surface to another with no loss, because they do not understand the role of physical evidence in interpreting what communications in fact consist of. Any reproduction, whether clear or indistinct, must be suspect simply because it is not the ultimate source: documentary texts, like all other artifacts, must be examined first-hand if one is serious about approaching them as historical evidence. Even those persons who have shown themselves in print to be critical of photocopies have generally not alluded to this underlying reason for the inadequacy of all reproductions; instead they have often suggested that copies could indeed replace originals if only the technology of copying could be improved so as to eliminate its present defects (though how the possibility of error can ever be eradicated is hard to see). Frank Weitenkampf, for example, discussing facsimiles of all kinds, says that despite the advent of photographic processes "there is still some need for caution in accepting results, particularly those of the earlier years of these processes." 25 The last nine words suggest that the growth of technology can make reproductions respectable. Weitenkampf's next sentence reinforces the point: "Even some of the later ones may not quite come up to the mark"—in other words, a mark does exist (even if it has not been reached) at which copies can be substitutes for originals. At the end he asserts, "We cannot carry on certain studies with copies that are not 'exact'" (p. 130). He places "exact" in quotation marks, recognizing that no copy reproduces every feature of the original, and yet he seems to believe that copies can reach a level of exactness adequate for "certain studies"—those studies apparently being the more demanding ones, whereas less exact copies are seemingly satisfactory for other studies. The same misunderstanding of the nature of documentary evidence is shown by another class of critics of reproductions: those who complain that reproductions, particularly microfilms and microfiche, are difficult to use. Indeed, most people who raise objections to photocopies are thinking not of the accuracy of the reproduction but of their own discomfort in sitting in front of a microfilm or microfiche reader. The triviality of this point of view would make it scarcely worth noting if it were not for the prominence of many of the people who have expressed such sentiments in recent years. Their comments suggest that there is nothing wrong with microfacsimiles except the awkwardness of using them; but that is enough (since research should presumably be comfortable) to provide grounds for protest. The shallowness of this general line is well represented by a 1958 statement of Lawrence S. Thompson's: it must always be remembered that microfacsimiles will always take second place to the codex book, at least until some genius developes a way for reading them everywhere that books can be read: in the subway, in the bathtub, in a fishing skiff, and the various other places whence readers are wont to repair. Microfacsimiles can never provide the feels, the smells, or the good bookish dust and dirt that made bibliophiles of most of us. 26 There is no hint here of the serious reasons for preferring original books to photocopies or of why bibliophily is important. An almost equally superficial view of the relation between book collecting and photocopying had much earlier been expressed by Willard Austen, librarian at Cornell: For practical use for scholarly purposes the photostat copy seems to give all that is desired. It does not of course satisfy the collector's desire, which only the original can do, but as original copies are limited and transportation is risky at best, research is greatly helped by the copies and the possessor of the original is none the poorer by sharing the substance with the world. 27 Such a comment trivializes both historical research and book collecting, showing no recognition of how the "substance" of a verbal artifact is connected to its physical form. Unfortunately the problems inherent in this statement would not be noticed even today by many people. Over the years discussions of photocopying have intermittently addressed the question of the admissability of photocopies in courts of law, and in the process they have exhibited yet again a failure to focus on basic issues. In 1921 both John Clement Fitzpatrick (of the Library of Congress Manuscript Division) and John S. Greene (of the Photostat Corporation) stated that photostats are accepted as evidence in court, whereas photographs are not, because (in Fitzpatrick's words) "nothing intervenes between the original and the photostat print, which is not the case with a photograph, which has the developed plate between the original and the finished reproduction" and therefore (in Greene's words) "it is an easy matter to rearrange a photograph." 28 Greene was so rash as to say that "the photostat print cannot be changed," but there are now millions of users of xerographic copying machines who would understand why that statement is not the whole truth. 29 Jerry McDonald, in the course of his critical discussion of microfilm, says, "The legality of microfilm is pretty well established," although judges can decide in individual cases what is acceptable: "If you encounter one who has had a bad experience with film, he may reject it as primary evidence." All one can say is that any judges who do accept reproductions are lowering the evidentiary standards of their courts; certainly no reproduction can offer "primary evidence" unless the reproduction itself is the document at issue. Nor does certification help: Edward Tweedell noted in 1921 that the Crerar Library had provided many photocopies in patent cases, "for which certified copies are furnished"—as if certification were what gave them legal standing. 30 But certification only means that the person doing the certifying believes the copy to be faithful; if the original exists, second-hand testimony is unnecessary. That courts sometimes accept photographic and xerographic copies should affect no one's thinking about the appropriateness of reproductions as evidence; the definition of primary evidence ought to be the same in scholarly research and in courts of law, but neither scholars nor judges are immune from lapses in logic. All the comments I have quoted here about the legal uses of photocopies miss the essential point: that photocopies are different documents from the originals. It is ironic that legal procedure, which is founded on a critical approach to evidence and which does not tolerate a confusion of hearsay and primary evidence where human witnesses are concerned, can sometimes fail to recognize the same confusion when the witnesses are documents. 31 That this confusion does occur in court is a measure of how deeply seated is the belief in the transferability of documentary texts from one document to another—a belief that has probably intensified with the increase in the use of copying machines, in spite of the undeniably wide recognition of the alteration of documentary texts that takes place in copying centers everywhere. 32 Although different methods of reproduction may offer different opportunities for error and for intentional alteration, all are alike in producing new documents that in one degree or another are not identical with the documents supposedly being copied. And whether those documents contain handwritten or printed texts is of course irrelevant. I have therefore made no distinctions here among the various copying processes or between manuscript and printed materials. There is one way, however, in which printed materials do pose a special problem. Nearly all such materials were originally printed in editions of more than a single copy; and, if more than one copy of an edition survives today, anyone wishing to make a reproduction of that edition must decide which copy to use. Copies of an edition (that is, copies printed from the same type-setting) cannot be assumed to be identical to each other for the same reason that reproductions cannot be assumed to be identical to the originals: they are separate physical objects, separate documents. Indeed, as analytical bibliographers have been showing for a century or so, copies of printed editions from the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries can be expected to vary as a result of stop-press alterations made during the course of printing; and copies of later editions often vary because of the excision and substitution of leaves or entire gatherings and because of changes made between press runs. A reproduction of any one copy of a printed item represents only that copy, not the edition as a whole; yet both producers and users of photofacsimiles of printed material often assume that the facsimile can stand for the edition. This problem, to be sure, is not limited to reproductions, for the same people would obviously not realize that in using an original they would need to collate it against other copies. Whenever one needs to talk about an entire edition—as in a scholarly critical edition, or a descriptive bibliography, or a critical essay—one must be aware of the differences among copies of the edition. 33 If a published facsimile is to be of service to scholarship, it ought to be accompanied by a record of the ways in which the copy photographed varies in text from other copies. When a reproduction of printed material does not include such information, one therefore has further reason for being cautious, in addition to the reasons that apply to all reproductions. It is in fact not necessary for a photofacsimile of printed material to be limited to the pages of a single copy of an edition, unless the aim is to reproduce a particular copy. Fredson Bowers, who has given this question its most thoughtful treatment, believes that "the ideal photographic facsimile—containing the necessary apparatus—should consist of a collection of formes from any number of copies, these formes being chosen first according to the principle of their textual state, and second according to clarity and fidelity of the inking." 34 The most prominent use of this approach thus far is Charlton Hinman's The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare (1968), in which the corrected state of each forme is represented. Hinman's apparatus identifies the copies used, as well as the "substantive and semisubstantive" variant readings of the uncorrected states. Such a reproduction does in a sense represent the edition as a whole because it draws on evidence present in a large number of the surviving copies and rises above the idiosyncrasies of individual copies, with their fortuitous assemblages of sheets. It is a product of scholarship and serves a purpose that no unannotated facsimile of a single copy, and indeed no single copy in the original, could serve. As a collection of photographs, it cannot escape the problems inherent in all reproductions; but, given that limitation, it shows how the difficulties presented by printed editions can be responsibly accommodated in a facsimile. Reproductions do have their uses, as long as one understands why they must always be approached with caution and why they can never be thought to obviate examination of originals. 35 There is an enormous difference between the attitude underlying the careful production of facsimile editions, involving thorough proofreading and the writing of notes commenting on potentially misleading spots, 36 and the frame of mind exhibited by persons who order photocopies and proceed to use them as the equivalent of the originals, never making any direct comparisons. Some of the large commercial projects for supplying extensive series of microfilm, microfiche, or xerographic copies are unfortunately much nearer to the latter than the former. If one Los Angeles company, after examining the results of its order for the microfilming of 2,300,000 documents, had to require the refilming of 35,000, 37 one can imagine how often the microfilms that scholars use may be defective, for they are not always subjected even to the kind of inspection (which presumably did not include proofreading) that this company undertook. Every reproduction of a written or printed text, whether prepared by a publisher for public distribution or by an individual for personal use, should be proofread against the original just as carefully as if it were a newly typeset text, and notes should be made describing the original at those places where the reproduction misrepresents it enough to cause a reader possibly to misinterpret the text. 38 Even a reproduction of a manuscript that is to be used, or published, with an accompanying transcription should be supplemented with such notes, which in effect explain how some of the words or punctuation marks in the transcription were arrived at. Handled in this way, reproductions can serve as a useful stopgap, until one can return to the originals for a final check. They can thus be a true convenience, whereas without these precautions their helpfulness is illusory. There is no way that reproductions—regardless of what technology is developed in the future 39 —can ever be the equal of originals as documentary evidence, for there is no way of getting around the fact that they are one step (at least) removed from those originals. And there is no way that the existence of reproductions, however high their quality, can justify the destruction of originals. No one seems to have trouble understanding why a reproduction of a vase cannot replace the original for any serious study; but many people apparently fail to see that a paper with written or printed words on it is also an artifact, containing an unreproducible assemblage of clues to its own genesis. 40 Originals are clearly necessary for the study of the distribution or publishing of verbal works; but they are also essential for the study of the texts contained in those distributed objects, whether manuscripts or printed books. The words that come to us from the past, transmitted by paper and ink, cannot be assumed to reflect accurately what their authors intended; in order to assess how the words that are present in documents came to be there, and indeed to try to make sure that we know what words are in fact there, we must avail ourselves of all the evidence that comes with them. The study of the past requires artifacts from the past; reproductions are the products of a different time from that of the originals they attempt to duplicate, and they therefore transport us to a different time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III That these considerations have not always been understood by those to whom we ought to be able to turn for guidance in such matters has been repeatedly demonstrated in recent years. For example, in A Guide to Documentary Editing (1987), written by Mary-Jo Kline for the Association for Documentary Editing, the principal discussion of the use of originals consists of the following: "Whenever possible, transcriptions should be perfected against the originals of their source texts, not merely against photocopied versions. When this is not feasible, the edition's introduction should make this omission clear" (p. 178). 41 The second sentence is certainly true: readers of an edition should always be informed when a transcription has not been read against the original. But the first sentence, prescribing a reading against the original "Whenever possible," fails to convey a sense of the importance of the procedure, suggesting only that it is desirable, not that it is essential. A fuller statement on this matter is a conspicuous lack in a book that places considerable emphasis on the use of photocopies. 42 Near the beginning we are told, "Modern scholarly editing was made a practical possibility by technological advances in one area—photoduplication" (p. 23); and the book treats in some detail the collecting and cataloguing of photocopies in the editorial office. The equivalence of originals and copies is implied by such statements as this: "The manuscript or a reliable photocopy is to be preferred over any later scribal copies or transcriptions as the source text" (p. 82). In the section on "Microform Supplements" (i.e., to letterpress editions), the choice between film and fiche is addressed (pp. 70-71), but nothing is said about the proofreading that such facsimile publications require. There is even the assertion that the "fathers of expanded transcription," Julian Boyd and Lyman Butterfield, did not record in letterpress editions certain kinds of details from manuscript texts because they assumed "that microform editions of their projects' archives would make facsimiles of these source texts available to a wide audience" (p. 128). Perhaps they did; but surely some further comment is called for, in an introductory guide of this sort, explaining not only the limitations of microfilm but also the contribution made by a full record in print. The term "source text," rather than "source document," is repeatedly used, implying that the text is easily extractable from the artifact that preserved it. In the context of this book, the absence of a detailed warning about the problems presented by reproductions is positively misleading. The treatment of reproductions in this Guide should be contrasted with that in an earlier comparable guide, the 1967 Statement of Editorial Principles of the Center for Editions of American Authors. This Statement insists at the outset that "if the editor is using photocopies of manuscripts, he must read his working copy against the originals to be certain that he has not missed changes or additions or cancellations that do not show up in photocopy" (p. 2). A few pages later a more detailed and forceful directive is issued: If the copy-text is manuscript or author-corrected proofs, the editor or someone trained in reading the author's hand must prepare typed working copy, normally from photocopy. . . . But photocopy is unreliable in that marginal correction or addition may not be included, that light pencil may not show up clearly, that erasures in the original which are readable against the light will fail to show in reproduction, and that variations in color disappear. The basic requirement therefore is that the typescript, fully corrected against everything recoverable in the photocopy, must be read against the original manuscript at least twice. There is some advantage in a second reading at a later date; but the editor may be able to visit the manuscript only once, and will therefore necessarily perform this double check during the course of his one visit. If the editor has not made the double check on his original visit and is dealing with manuscripts that are widely dispersed, such as letters, a single editor named by the general editor may travel to perform this second check for other editors, or a competent local scholar may make it. The name of the traveling editor or the local scholar should be cited in each volume where his help has been enlisted. (pp. 5-6) Both these statements are repeated in the revised edition of 1972 (entitled Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures ), with the first one expanded to include a warning against reading "as punctuation in the photocopies what are actually smudges, specks, or holes in the manuscript" (p. 1). The Committee on Scholarly Editions, which succeeded the CEAA, endorses the same procedures and issued a set of "Guiding Questions" for testing editions, including the question (quoted here from the April 1977 version), "Where copy-text is manuscript, how have the transcriptions or copies of manuscript been verified against the original?" The CEAA/CSE requirement of checking transcriptions against originals, which had thus been in effect for twenty years at the time A Guide to Documentary Editing was published, is of course the out-growth of a longer scholarly tradition. Against this background the statements about photocopies in the Guide appear particularly weak and disappointing, and the Guide in this respect takes a large step backward. Another egregious recent instance of misunderstanding the nature of reproductions is provided by a policy of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas. Decherd Turner, a few months after he became its director, proclaimed his views in "An HRC Decalogue," published in the personal newsletter he had established ( HRC Notes , No. 3, Thanksgiving 1980). The sixth item in his decalogue reads in full as follows: Changing technology raises some dramatic questions for HRC. With the advent of Xerox and other cheap copying techniques, the uniqueness of the HRC holdings becomes threatened. The purpose of the 9 million literary manuscripts at HRC has been to gather in one place materials not available elsewhere as a support to full research. Such research at this time results in the publication of approximately sixty books per year—with no way of fully knowing how many periodical articles. We will not purchase materials which have already been Xeroxed and/or microfilmed. Why should we? If copies exist elsewhere, why should we spend the dollars and the talent to purchase and classify them? These technology-instituted issues are immensely critical to HRC. The patent absurdity of this statement is compounded when one reads the second item of the decalogue: HRC has the highest stake in the field of conservation of any major library in the world. The preeminence of our manuscript collections brings with it the preeminent threat of destruction. Since most of the manuscript holdings are of nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature, we are, in this sense, a self-destruct library. If the conservation issue is not solved at this time, in sixty years a goodly portion of HRC can be swept up with a broom and dustpan. Each day's delay in the establishment of a full and operative conservation laboratory is a day courting the disdain of history. When one puts these two statements together, the incredible incoherence of the position becomes apparent. If it would be a waste of money to buy manuscript materials of which "copies exist elsewhere," then the copies must be fully the equal of the originals. In that case, why spend money on the conservation of the original documents already on hand, when inexpensive photocopies of them could be made? Indeed, why should good money be spent on originals at all, even virgin documents that have never been violated by camera or copying machine? Let other libraries, foolish enough not to object to materials that have been reproduced, buy the originals; Texas could then for comparatively little money build up a magnificent collection of photocopies. 43 It is difficult to believe that, once Turner's decalogue was in print, there was not enough forceful opposition to this stand on reproduction to result in an alteration of the policy. But the stand continued to be enunciated. In the ninth newsletter, dated 31 March 1984, one section is entitled "The Copy Machine." After asserting, "Perhaps no development like the Xerox copy has so identified the distinctions between the needs of the librarian and those of the private collector," Turner makes his principal point: For the private collector, his love of his original letter by James Joyce is not diminished by the fact that fifty Xerox copies exist, since after all, the collector has the original. For the librarian, an entirely different perspective prevails. The existence of the copies, or even publication of the letter, has fulfilled the librarian's basic motivation—the letter has been saved. To spend institutional dollars on manuscript materials which have been copied and are thus available is dubious wisdom. Turner here places "the librarian" in the unenviable position of believing that the existence of a Xerox copy of a document—or a published text of it!—drains the original of scholarly value. Yet a few sentences earlier he had said, "The object of a librarian's dollar is to gather unique materials into one place for purposes of research." To insure that they are unique, one must insist on certification that they have not been copied: "Without certification, the librarian is in serious jeopardy of spending resources for materials which are not unique, thus calling into question his judgment." But if copies are as good as originals, what is the point of assembling "unique materials" instead of encouraging their multiplication? 44 And if anyone is ever allowed to publish the texts of the "unique materials," was the "librarian's dollar" well spent after all? Does not this approach to a research collection lead to a situation in which materials are gathered to be hidden from view rather than made available for scholarly dissemination? 45 Turner's position is by no means representative of that of other special-collections librarians; indeed, it is so extreme that it is perhaps not taken seriously by any of them. Yet the belief from which it springs—that copies can take the place of originals— is widespread, and the implications of it are frightening, as is the fact that even one director of a major library can hold it. From the point of view of the number of people involved, the most significant recent instances of misunderstanding the relation between copies and originals have occurred in connection with the book-preservation movement. The immense problems posed by the deterioration of books printed on acidic paper in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are finally being addressed seriously by many institutions and individuals, and we must be grateful for that. But the public statements by the persons active in this effort nearly always fail to recognize the limitations of photocopies as documentary evidence. The debates over the usage of the two terms conservation and preservation at least call attention to two distinct kinds of activity: operations intended to extend the life of the original physical book and operations intended to transfer the text to a new physical object. In the library world the treatment of originals is increasingly coming to be called conservation , with preservation used as the broader term that encompasses the transfer of texts. One person who has been vocal in making this distinction is Pamela W. Darling, but in the process she illustrates a common confusion. "In the museum world," she says, "where every item is unique, con servation is—quite properly in my view—the dominant term since physical care is virtually the only option. Microfilming the paintings or recording the appearance of woven baskets on an optical disc and discarding the originals would hardly do!" 46 The implication is that books are different: that, in contrast to all other human products, they are not unique and that, once their texts have been copied, nothing is lost by discarding them. Verbal works are indeed different from paintings in that they do not exist on paper in the way paintings exist on canvas, for language is an abstract medium; but those who believe that verbal works can simply be copied on film are failing to recognize the contribution physical evidence makes toward assessing the reliability of a given text as a representation of a particular verbal work. In addition, of course, every book is a piece of evidence for the study of publishing history. 47 Preservation is much in the news, and librarians have frequently been interviewed on the subject, very often with unfortunate results. For example, the Yale Alumni Magazine for Summer 1987 reported on the preservation program in the Yale libraries in these terms: "The decisions on what to save and what to reformat aren't made lightly. As an overall rule, books valued for their information are given a new format. Books and documents valued as objects are conserved." 48 This distinction is in fact nonexistent: all books are potentially valuable for their "information" (their texts), and all are worth saving as artifacts, as evidences of past human activity directed to the transmission of texts. What this statement is in practice likely to mean is that books of high market value will receive expensive conservation treatment, and other books will be microfilmed or photocopied and then thrown out. Such a policy is not worthy of a research library. A few months after this article on Yale, a similar piece about Columbia appeared in the Columbia alumni magazine, with the same false distinction between "intrinsic value" and "content": "For the most part, Columbia conserves only books that have some intrinsic value, such as those with marginal notes, elaborate bindings, or excellent illustrations that would not microfilm well. Works valuable only for their content and for which replacement copies are not available are usually given a new format, such as microfilm, microfiche, or photocopy." 49 Microfilm is several times referred to in such terms as "the only proven medium" (p. 16) or "a technology that we know works" (p. 18); what should have been said instead is that we know it does not work. Librarians admit, according to the article, that "few scholars like to use microfilm" (p. 18); but the basis of the complaint is the expected one, that microfilms are not as easy to use as books, and nothing is said about the status of reproductions as secondary, not primary, evidence. To raise these issues is not to object to the microfilming of endangered books: there is no question that vast quantities of books are crumbling apart and that having texts on microfilm is better than not having them at all. But the widespread misunderstanding of documentary evidence leads to the unnecessary destruction of books in the name of textual "preservation." An article in the New York Times describes the usual procedure: The New York Public Library's microfilming division is the second largest in the country after that of the Library of Congress. Dozens of times a day, books are "guillotined"—the leaves are severed close to the spine—then microfilmed two pages at a time. Ten full-time camera operators snap more than two million frames a year. The remains of the books are tossed into the trash unless a collector claims them, and any valuable maps or illustrations are, of course, saved and placed in protective Mylar sleeves. In special cases, the book itself is spared: the pages are shot unsevered, and the volume is encased in a custom-made box of acid-free cardboard. 50 The "special cases" referred to are by definition uncommon, and the general rule in preservation-microfilming operations is to discard what is left of the books after microfilming. An article in the Washington Post describes the fate of a 1909 book by the American explorer Fanny Bullock Workman after a reader at the Library of Congress called for it and thus brought its condition to the attention of the library staff: "Once the filming was complete, the physical remains of the book were taken to the Exchange and Gifts division where they were boxed up with other library waste paper and shipped to a pulping company in Baltimore to be turned into pulp." 51 Although this article takes more seriously than it should the complaints about the inconvenience of microfilm, it is unusual in being generally critical of the aftermath of microfilming and puts the problem concisely when it says, "Spines are still being split and pages pulped as books disappear into information." 52 The determination of which books to microfilm (or to microfilm first) and then to destroy is a central issue in preservation-microfilming circles, and the thinking about it further illustrates the confusion between documents and "information" (or "statements," or "works"). The mentality that does not distinguish copies from originals is likely also to treat different editions of a work as unnecessary duplications of information and is ready for the next step of believing that some works, having apparently been superseded by others, need no longer exist. Deciding to microfilm great quantities of material in a given field during a particular period "saves time"—according to the article on Columbia quoted just above—"but risks wasting resources on books that will never be used" (p. 19). What will be used, of course, can never be predicted. But this way of thinking has led to the formation of groups of scholars to select the most important titles in their fields for microfilming. In 1984 the American Philological Association began a project to place on microfiche the texts of the most important classical studies published between 1850 and 1918, and a 1987 report of this undertaking 53 states near the beginning that we must not "waste our resources on materials that are unimportant." Commenting on the alternative "vacuum cleaner approach" ("preserving on a wholesale basis everything from a particular range of dates or place of publication"), the authors recognize the argument that "there might someday be a use even for materials whose importance is not evident at present"; but they proceed to say in the next sentence, rather incoherently, that the major weakness of this approach is "that materials which may never be needed by scholars take up time and money and thus displace more important materials that aren't in the chosen group" (p. 141). If titles must be selected, asking a group of scholars for advice is appropriate; but the committee should not fool itself by thinking that some works lack usefulness, for there is no product of the past that is not useful in studying the past. The APA report is noteworthy for showing that even a group of specialists in an important area, giving protracted thought to the details of a large microfiche project, can neglect entirely the question of the status of reproductions as documentary evidence. Although, the authors say, the "involvement of scholars in preservation decision making has sharpened our sense of some of the key issues in preservation, both philosophical and pragmatic" (p. 144), the philosophical considerations do not include this most basic one. When the authors report that "most preservation programs concentrate on preserving the contents of brittle materials with little artifactual value" (p. 140), there is no criticism of the last phrase; and although the project policy allows for the retention of some books after filming, it "aims at minimizing the retention of badly damaged books" (p. 145). Rather than saving books for scholars who dislike fiche, a "deliberate strategy" of the project is to work to overcome "scholarly resistance" to microforms—with the result that "scholarly attitudes toward preservation filming will be improved" (p. 142). This goal seems so important to the authors as to constitute the subject of their final paragraph: The reasons for and consequences of preservation microfilming need to be made clear to scholars. The active involvement of scholars in the design and execution of preservation projects can help in this slow task of education and lead to greater acceptance by the colleagues of those involved, thus making scholars participants rather than obstructions in the task of developing the scholarly information systems of the next century. A different program of education would seem to be needed. Scholars should not be scolded for being "obstructions" to the discarding of artifacts, but they should be taught that there is a far more important reason for fighting that battle than the mere discomfort of having to sit in front of machines to do their reading. That scholars are in need of this lesson is clear from a February 1988 "Summary Report on Preservation Initiative among ACLS Societies," based on responses from constituent societies to a request for information from the president of the American Council of Learned Societies. It seems apparent from this report that only two of the responding societies, the American Antiquarian Society and the Bibliographical Society of America, called attention to the connections between "physical form and intellectual content"; and the report treated their concern as applying to a special category of material rather than to all material. 54 An appropriate mechanism for the education of scholars (and other readers as well) regarding the relation of copies to originals would now seem to exist, in the Commission on Preservation and Access. This Commission was established in 1986 by the Council on Library Resources to confront on the national level the problem of "capturing and making accessible the content of brittle books" (in the words of its report for the year ending 30 June 1987). The goal is, "in effect, to form a new national collection of preserved materials" by coordinating the filming of at least three million volumes over a twenty-year period. This ambitious effort has already achieved a great deal of visibility, and its active program of public education includes a widely distributed film, Slow Fires , that aims to help form a "cohesive sense of a preservation ethic for the product of mankind's accumulated learning and experience." 55 The undertaking is a noble one, but thus far the Commission has not made an emphatic statement about the importance of the physical evidence present in every artifact. 56 This project could be nobler still if it included in its educational objectives the teaching of this fundamental truth. The value of the Commission's microfilming program would not be undercut—quite the reverse—by a frank acknowledgment of the limitations of microfilm and a careful explanation of the meaning of documentary evidence. If the Commission would then put these ideas into practice and direct that the remains of every microfilmed book be saved for whatever bibliographical evidence it still offers, the result would be an even greater contribution to the avowed goal of preserving our intellectual heritage. 57 A central repository could be established for receiving the books, if the libraries that possessed them before microfilming did not wish to keep them. By these actions the Commission could be a powerful influence in demonstrating to the general public and scholars alike that every scrap of artifactual evidence is worth saving, that all books (not just "rare" books) are important as objects, even to persons who are not particularly concerned with publishing history and whose only interest is in understanding the texts in books. No one has ever before been in such a favorable position as the Commission on Preservation and Access for publicizing these ideas, and by doing so it could contribute immeasurably to the cause of historical scholarship, without adding greatly to the cost of its endeavor as a whole. If this moment is not seized, the nightmare vision of microfilming that William A. Jackson depicted nearly fifty years ago may become a reality: To all the classic "Enemies of Books" has now been added this devouring monster of the microfilm pressure table. By cajolery, threats, exhortation, and constant vigilance the librarians of today must guard their treasures against this danger which lurks in the distant corner where, amid his livid lights and chemical smells, the photographer has his lair. (p. 288) Jackson might be surprised—but, on second thought, probably would not be—by the significance that his phrase "devouring monster" has taken on as the years have passed. Microfilming equipment need not be the monster it sometimes is, and books need not be abandoned after their encounter with it. But if librarians are to protect those books, they must come to understand that their treasures are all the books in their charge, not just those in "treasure rooms." Microfilms and other reproductions can be helpful to scholarship if their proper use is recognized; but equating them with originals undermines scholarship by allowing precision to be replaced with approximation and secondary evidence to be confused with primary. The texts of many documents that once existed are now lost forever, and the texts of others are known only in copies. We use whatever there is; but when there are originals, we must not let substitutes supplant them as the best evidence we can have for recovering statements from the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Letter ("Placing Oscar Wilde") to the Times Literary Supplement , 30 October-5 November 1987, p. 1195. 2 Report to the Corporation of Brown University, June 19, 1913 , p. 8. Another use of the machine, he says, is "furnishing a convenient and relatively inexpensive means of copying for our own files pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers of which we do not possess the originals, and which we are not likely to have an opportunity to buy." In the following year's Report (dated 18 June 1914), Winship returned to the subject (pp. 11-12): "The photostat has been in steady use during the year," he said; and the "principal service upon which the Library is now engaged is an attempt to furnish experimental evidence of the practical usefulness of our photographic copying machine for reproducing colonial newspapers." Although these statements do not suggest that copies can fully substitute for originals, they imply no question about the accuracy of photographic copies. 3 Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 35 (1941), 281-288 (quotations from pp. 282-283). 4 Even though the relation of the work to the artifact is very different: in the case of paintings, watercolors, engravings, and the like, the work and the artifact inhabit the same physical space, since the work uses tangible media; in the case of literature, music, and dance, the texts embodied in artifacts do not constitute the works but only attempts at conveying instructions for recreating the works. (I have elaborated this point in my Rosenbach Lectures, A Rationale of Textual Criticism , forthcoming from the University of Pennsylvania Press.) 5 The best study of type-facsimiles is Allen T. Hazen, "Type-Facsimiles," Modern Philology , 44 (1946-47), 209-17. For an early criticism of such facsimiles, see Henry Wilson, "Remarks on Facsimile Reproductions," Library Association of the United Kingdom Monthly Notes , 1 (1880), 33-40. 6 See, for example, Carole Louise Morley, Xerography: An Annotated Bibliography (1970); and Michael R. Gabriel, Micrographics, 1900-1977: A Bibliography (1978). A brief pamphlet, Microform Information: First Sources was published by the Reproduction of Library Materials Section of the American Library Association in 1973 and has since been revised. Most of the literature of this field naturally deals with technical matters. Some historical accounts of the growth of the field (with references to other writings) can be found in Frederic Luther, Microfilm: A History, 1839-1900 (1959); Robert F. Clarke, The Impact of Photocopying on Scholarly Publishing (Rutgers diss., 1963); Xerography and Related Processes , ed. John H. Dessauer and Harold E. Clark (1965); H. R. Verry, Microcopying Methods (1954; rev. Gordon H. Wright, 1967); "Sources for the History of Micropublishing," in Studies in Micropublishing, 1853-1976: Documentary Sources , ed. Allen B. Veaner (1977), pp. 79-150; Jack Rubin, A History of Micrographics in the First Person (1980). 7 It originally appeared in the Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 24 (1920), 535-540; a revised edition of the pamphlet form appeared in 1925. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the early comments display an enthusiasm that seems determined to avoid recognizing problems. Richard Garnett, speaking on "Photography in Public Libraries" at the 1884 conference of the Library Association of the United Kingdom, eloquently advanced the view that national libraries had a responsibility to establish photography departments and in the course of his remarks said: "Though, as recently pointed out by Dr. Hessels, the photograph may not be absolutely unerring in the reproduction of minute facsimile, if made with due care it is practically adequate in the vast majority of instances." He then added, as if this statement were too cautious, that "save as a matter of sentiment" it would "be almost indifferent" whether a library had an original or a facsimile ( Transactions and Proceedings , 1884, pp. 66-73, 142-144; quotations from pp. 66-67). Even A. W. Pollard suggested in 1893 that photocopies of early books be used for permanent exhibitions in libraries that did not possess originals ("On the Exhibition of Facsimiles of Rare Books in Public Libraries," Library , 1st ser., 5 [1893], 260-264). (An exhibition of photostats was held in 1916 at Princeton University Library.) In 1916, Walter T. and Maude K. Swingle ("The Utilization of Photographic Methods in Library Research Work, with Especial Reference to the Natural Sciences," American Library Association Bulletin , 10: 194-199) believed that photography would enable American scholarship to come of age: "There is no longer any need for any competent scholar to be hampered for lack of material provided arrangements are made to install photostats in Old World library centers" (this statement occurs in the last section of their article, entitled "Every Book and Manuscript in the World Placed Within the Reach of the Investigator by Photographic Means"). Earlier they declared, "In the copying of ancient manuscripts the photostat method is absolutely necessary to secure accuracy" (p. 196). 8 Consisting of five articles and the reports of two meetings: George Watson Cole, "The Photostat in Bibliographical and Research Work—A Symposium," pp. 1-16; Chester March Cate, "The Photostat and the Huntington Library," pp. 17-21; Edward D.

Shaw, "Should Scientists Use Microfilm?", Library Quarterly, 14 (1944), 229-233. (Another article with a promising title, but dealing only with the duplication of titles in microfilming projects, is Robert B. Eckles, "Some Problems in Scholarly Uses of Microphoto Publication," American Archivist , 27 [1964], 565-567.) 16 Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 65 (1961), 97-101; reprinted in Veaner (see note 6 above), pp. 290-294. 17 Blank leaves, for example, are often skipped, even in published facsimiles. Franklin B. Williams, Jr. (see note 19 below) properly observes, "A facsimile reprint should be bibliographically complete, with notice of blank leaves regardless of their presence in the base copy" (p. 117). David Vander Meulen has shown ( Scriblerian , 17 [1985] 178-180) how the omission of some blank pages and an insufficient commentary on physical structure affect the interpretation of the evidence presented in the photographs in Maynard Mack's The Last and Greatest Art: Some Unpublished Poetical Manuscripts of Alexander Pope (1984). (Some reviewers of this work implied that the inclusion of blanks did not serve much purpose: James McLaverty [ Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography , n.s., 1 (1987), 89] and Howard Weinbrot [ Studies in English Literature , 25 (1985), 696] expressed their readiness to exchange the blanks for reproductions of other material, Weinbrot calling the blanks "curious" and describing them as having been "superstitiously reproduced.") 18 Another problem, often encountered in xerographic copies, is that the copy is not identical in size with the original; some discussion of the reproduction ratios of xerographic machines appears in the Wall Street Journal , 24 September 1984, p. 1, col. 4. 19 "Photo-Facsimiles of STC Books: A Cautionary Check List," Studies in Bibliography , 21 (1968), 109-130 (quotation from p. 109). At about the same time, Frederick Anderson provided a concise statement of the "Hazards of Photographic Sources" for the first number (March 1968) of the CEAA Newsletter (Center for Editions of American Authors). "It appears to be inevitable," he said, "that the person filming or xeroxing material will omit some of it" (p. 5), and he commented on the difficulty of reading cancellations in photocopies and on the likelihood of interpreting stray marks as punctuation. 20 Other historical accounts appear in the articles gathered in the Library in 1926 (note 13 above). 21 The examples in this paragraph are from Williams (note 19 above), p. 117; Vander Meulen, letter to me; Blayney, "An Error in Microfilm," Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 126-127; Williams, pp. 111, 114, 114, 117; Sullivan, "Bibliography and Facsimile Editions," PBSA , 72 (1978), 327-329. 22 The examples in this paragraph are from Bowers, "The Yale Folio Facsimile and Scholarship," Modern Philology , 53 (1955-56), 50-57; Greene, in The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography , n.s., 3 (for 1977), 283-285; Vander Meulen, letter to me. 23 "The Scandal of Ulysses ," New York Review of Books , 30 June 1988, pp. 32-39. Another example from Joyce material, furnished to me by Kidd, illustrates the point that different facsimiles of the same material may read differently: the first page proof for page 153 of Ulysses is reproduced both in The James Joyce Archive (23: 115) and in Philip Gaskell's From Writer to Reader (1978), pp. 231, 242; in the former, where the photograph has a line around it, the word in the upper right corner appears to be "fivebarred", but in the latter, which shows the uneven edge of the proof, it seems to be "fivebarre". 24 The examples in this paragraph are from Williams (note 19 above), p. 114; Vander Meulen, letter to me; Sullivan (note 21 above); Williams, p. 117; Silver, Writing the History of American Printing (American Printing History Association Award Lecture, 1977), p. 7; Dodge, "Photographic Copies vs. Original Documents," PBSA , 71 (1977), 223-226. 25 "What Is a Facsimile?", PBSA , 37 (1943), 114-130 (quotation from p. 126). 26 "The Microfacsimile in American Research Libraries," Libri , 8 (1958), 209-222 (quotation from p. 221). 27 Quoted by George Watson Cole in his survey of responses to his questionnaire (see note 8 above), p. 10. Surprisingly, Randolph G. Adams seemed to take this sort of point more seriously than it deserves: "The matter of facsimiles vs. originals will always be argued between booklovers and mere scholars" ( Three Americanists [1939], p. 26). (He added, however, "All of us use facsimiles, photostats, or even films, when we cannot get the original. . . . But we do not prefer facsimiles, we simply use them when we cannot have ready access to the original" [pp. 26-27].) Gordon N. Ray comments briefly on the problems photocopies can cause in the relations between collectors and scholars on pp. 56-58 of his Clark Library seminar talk, "The Private Collector and the Literary Scholar," published in Louis B. Wright and Gordon N. Ray, The Private Collector and the Support of Scholarship (1969), pp. 25-80. 28 Quoted by Cole (see the preceding note), pp. 11, 14. 29 Is it this widespread understanding of how easily reproductions can be doctored that has led New York Telephone to ask its customers to return the " original payment document, not a reproduced copy" and has caused Time Incorporated to issue checks with a line at the top reading, "The face of this document has a colored background—not a white background"? One film that has given publicity to the legal questions posed by reproductions is The Verdict (1982). 30 For McDonald, see note 14 above (quotation from p. 351); for Tweedell, see note 8 above (quotation from p. 22). 31 Of course, if the authenticity of a document is questioned, an expert in the forensic examination of documents may when testifying wish to use photographs (such as enlarged photographs of segments of documents). For a thorough discussion, see Wilson R. Harrison, Suspect Documents (1958; with supp., 1966). Ways of recognizing some well-known reproductions (including some produced with intent to deceive) are detailed in Leonard Rapport, "Fakes and Facsimiles: Problems of Identification," American Archivist , 42 (1979), 13-58. 32 One manifestation of the general failure to differentiate photocopies from originals was described by the songwriter Sammy Cahn during an interview regarding the copyright protection of popular songs: "You'd be surprised how many people have asked me to autograph a Xerox of the sheet music for one of my songs!" (New York Times , 16 January 1984, p. C10). 33 In descriptive bibliography an argument has often been made (since Henry Stevens's Photo-Bibliography in 1878) in favor of substituting photographs of title pages for quasifacsimile transcriptions. Among other problems raised by this argument is the fact that a photograph records a single copy, whereas a bibliographical description (unless it is in a catalogue of a collection) aims at describing a whole edition. See my essays on "The Concept of Ideal Copy ," SB , 33 (1980), 18-53, and "Title-Page Transcription and Signature Collation Reconsidered," SB , 38 (1985), 45-81. 34 "The Problem of the Variant Forme in a Facsimile Edition," Library , 5th ser., 7 (1952), 262-272 (quotation from p. 263). Bowers's view is that uncorrected formes should normally be reproduced, because corrected formes are likely to have more compositorial spelling and punctuation, as well as errors in substantives made in the process of correcting other errors. 35 I have made some comments on the production and significance of facsimile editions in "Textual Scholarship," in Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. Joseph Gibaldi (1981), pp. 29-52 (esp. pp. 34-37). 36 The Center for Editions of American Authors in 1972 prepared a "Guide for Vetting Facsimile," which included these points: "the editor of the facsimile will be required to make a final collation of the sheets of the facsimile against the manuscript to determine if anything has been lost in the printing process. It is the vettor's responsibility to satisfy himself . . . that anything (i.e., colors of paper and writing) that has been lost in the reproduction process is noted in the apparatus" ( CEAA Newsletter , No. 5 [December 1972], pp. 9-10). 37 McDonald (note 14 above), p. 351. 38 If the reproduction is to be published, any page containing such spots should be rephotographed to see whether a more faithful reproduction of the original can be obtained. 39 Some hint of the sophistication of present technology can be found in "Facsimile Publishers," Abbey Newsletter , 11 (1987), 81. 40 As Kevin S. Kiernan says at the end of the preface to "Beowulf" and the "Beowulf" Manuscript (1981), "paleographical and codicological facts must ultimately be evaluated, as they can only have been gathered, by direct and prolonged access to the MS, not to the FSS, no matter how faithful or reliable they may seem" (p. xiii). He is able to present a considerable amount of new evidence because, remarkably, "the Beowulf MS has scarcely been studied at all. . . . most editors of the poem have relied on photographic FSS of the MS, and, often enough, modern transcriptions of the FSS, rather than on the MS itself" (p. 3). 41 Two pages earlier this statement occurs: " Perfection is the term used by some editors to describe checking editorial transcriptions made from photocopied source texts against the originals for each text." The passage does not go on to say that such checking is imperative. 42 Perhaps the strongest statement about originals in the book has a similar failing: "The age and condition of the manuscripts that bear the auhor's script may make even a rough transcription of their contents difficult. In such cases, the editor must verify his transcriptions against the originals before even beginning his assessment of the importance of each detail of inscription. And he may have to refer to those originals again and again during the period in which he labors to establish their texts for his edition" (p. 90). The phrase "In such cases" suggests that reference to originals is not a basic routine but an exceptional practice for unusual situations. 43 A plan similar to this has actually been proposed. Winston Broadfoot, in "How Inflation Affects Institutional Collecting," Manuscripts , 31 (1979), 293-296, claims that academic libraries "are not in the business of preserving artifacts," their function being "to supply the scholar with reliable data for his research." "Until the recent technology in photo-duplication," he goes on, "the scholar had to see original documents. This is no longer necessary, as proved by the great outpouring of substitute forms (film, fiche, and xerox) of library resources, including manuscripts . . . We are still paying thousands of dollars for original documents and giving away the information at ten cents a page. . . . Propelled by inflation and protected by reliable copies, private academic libraries should begin to sell their valuable manuscripts. . . . Perhaps the need for ambience will require the retention of some display pieces" (pp. 295-296). This foolish argument was fittingly replied to by Stanley Wertheim, who said, among other things, that photocopies "are in no way adequate substitute forms, and for purposes of textual and bibliographical research they are most often useless" ("Libraries as Conserving Institutions: A Reply to Mr. Broadfoot," Manuscripts , 32 [1980], 120-124). 44 This newsletter, like the earlier ones, also emphasizes conservation and does not recognize the contradiction at the heart of the argument. Three years later, in his twelfth newsletter (1 April 1986), Turner reiterated the same muddle. On the one hand, "The biggest issue facing the rare books world today is the need for an overwhelming involvement and investment in conservation." On the other, the HRC "will not purchase materials which have been copied in any form, and requires certification to the effect that they have not been copied; or, if copies have been made, a certification is required that all such copies are being surrendered with the originals." 45 The HRC has achieved some notoriety for being difficult in the matter of giving permission to publish the texts of materials in its collections. Most libraries do not control the literary rights to such texts; in some instances authors or their heirs have relinquished their literary rights to the libraries holding their papers, but generally libraries control only the access to the physical items in their collections, not the decisions regarding publication or republication of texts. Turner, however, says that the HRC acquires, along with "the physical property," the "full academic rights to its use." Such rights are, he says, "interpreted as unlimited use by accredited scholars and students for papers, dissertations, teaching, and publication in learned journals, up to and including publication of books by a University press" ( HRC Notes , No. 9). Whether or not this "unlimited use" includes publishing texts in their entirety is not clear, and further doubt is cast on the matter by the way the point is stated in a later newsletter: "Full academic rights are defined as the right of all students, faculty, and scholars to examine, make notes, prepare papers, write dissertations, and publish their conclusions in learned journals or through a university press" (No. 12). Given the frame of mind reflected in Turner's newsletters, one is not surprised (only further saddened) to note that an act passed by the Texas legislature in 1987 contains this provision: "Rare books, original manuscripts, personal papers, unpublished letters, and audio and video tapes held by an institution of higher education for the purposes of historical research are confidential, and the institution may restrict access by the public to those materials to protect the actual or potential value of the materials and the privacy of the donors" (70th Legislature, Chapter 408, H.B. 2136, amending the Education Code, Section 51.910). Respecting "the privacy of donors" is unobjectionable: donors have the right to require that certain material be closed for a time. And if protecting "the actual or potential value of the materials" means protecting them from destruction or mutilation ("value" referring to historical and scholarly value), there can again be no objection. But if, as unfortunately seems more likely, "value" refers to monetary value, the idea that a state or one of its institutions would classify materials (including published books) as "confidential" on the assumption that their market value was thereby being maintained is deplorable: such a practice would be antithetical to the aims of any institution truly devoted to the encouragement of scholarship. 46 "Preservation vs. Conservation," Abbey Newsletter , 9 (1985), 96-97. 47 Discussions of "intrinsic value" in the preservation literature take the position that some materials have it and some do not. I have not seen any discussion of preservation acknowledging that every artifact has intrinsic value. See, for example, "Intrinsic Value in Archival Material" (National Archives and Records Service Staff Information Paper No. 21, 1982), reprinted in part in Abbey Newsletter , 6 (1982), 66-67; and R. Gay Walker, "The Book as Object," in Research Libraries Group Preservation Manual (2nd ed., 1986), reprinted in Abbey Newsletter , 11 (1987), 4. Another aspect of preservation is the attempt to alleviate further deterioration of materials recognized to have intrinsic value by asking readers to use facsimiles instead of originals. This practice is unobjectionable as long as those responsible for administering it recognize the situations when use of the original is essential. Frederic Vergne, curator at the Condé Museum, is reported to have said that everyone will henceforth have to use the facsimile of "Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry": "I suppose some visiting head of state might be shown it if he asked, but the public and scholars no longer have direct access." Bernard Meehan of Trinity College Library, Dublin, plans to ask scholars to use the facsimile of the Book of Kells when it is completed: "Research into pigments and writing techniques are about the only reason anyone needs access to the original."

Two other approaches are mentioned: (1) "Searches are made to see if the same edition of the book can simply be replaced" (as if all copies of an edition are alike); (2) "Some of the most difficult decisions involve only slight differences among volumes. Is it worth the effort, for instance, to save several translations of the Greek classics?" (as if textual variants make no difference and the history of translation is unimportant). 49 Barbara L. Mount, "Save the Books," Columbia , 13, no. 3 (December 1987), 14-19 (quotation from p. 17). 50 Eric Stange, "Millions of Books Are Turning to Dust—Can They Be Saved?", New York Times Book Review , 29 March 1987, pp. 3, 38. 51 Joanna Biggar, "Our Disappearing Books," Washington Post Magazine , 3 June 1984, pp. 12-15; reprinted in condensed form in Abbey Newsletter , 8 (1984), 84-85. The reader who asked to purchase at least the photographs and maps from the guillotined Workman book was told that government property could not be sold or given to individuals, and these parts of the book were also destroyed. 52 A report in Abbey Newsletter (12 [1988], 2) of an International Symposium on Newspaper Preservation and Access (London, August 1987) states, "There was concern expressed by a number of participants that U.S. institutions discard very brittle newspapers after filming. The consensus was that one copy of every newspaper published should be preserved in the original, by somebody, somewhere, somehow, and should be accessible; but who will pay for it?" Proposing to save one copy of every number of every newspaper is a move in the right direction, but one copy can scarcely stand for an edition as a whole, which may well have included variant issues. 53 Roger S. Bagnall and Carolyn L. Harris, "Involving Scholars in Preservation Decisions: The Case of the Classicists," Journal of Academic Librarianship , 13 (1987), 140-146. 54 The New York Document Conservation Advisory Council has mounted a vigorous campaign to arouse public interest in the state's historical records, both manuscript and printed, and has published an impressive booklet, Our Memory at Risk (1988). But the booklet takes the usual line on intrinsic value: "Institutions should survey their holdings to identify material with intrinsic value" (p. 21). Another recent publication destined to be widely read, the American Library Association's Preservation Microfilming: A Guide for Librarians and Archivists (ed. Nancy E. Gwinn for the Association of Research Libraries, 1987), unfortunately perpetuates the same misconception. Wesley L. Boomgaarden, in the chapter on "Selection of Materials for Microfilming" (pp. 26-60), says, "Even though most items in a research collection are valued primarily for their intellectual content, certain items may possess intrinsic value as artifacts or objects and should be preserved and retained in their original or near-original forms" (p. 55). In her review of this book ( Rare Books &amp; Manuscripts Librarianship , 3, no. 1 [Spring 1988], 59-63), Cathy Henderson usefully points out that Boomgaarden's chapter "reinforces some prevalent biases that should at least be questioned" (pp. 61-62). The first, she says, is "to allow very real economic pressures to cause you to view the decision to retain an item or collection after microfilming as a necessary evil"; and she cautions against an easy acceptance of the "film-and-destroy habit" (p. 62). 55 Peter Winterble in National Preservation News (the newsletter of the National Preservation Program Office in the Library of Congress), No. 7 (May 1987), p. 7. Issues of this newsletter (along with those of the Abbey Newsletter ) offer a good way to keep abreast of preservation activities. 56 In its early booklet (when it was called "Committee on Preservation and Access"), Brittle Books (1986), it made the usual kind of statement: "Many individual volumes of intrinsic value (e.g., those with important marginal notes; those that are exceptional examples of bookmaking) should be safeguarded as artifacts" (p. 8). 57 The argument that other copies of these books still exist carries no force: the microfilmed copy may differ in various ways from other copies; and the destruction of any copy (no matter how large the edition) carries away with it part of the evidence for generalizing about the edition as a whole.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">An Inquiry into the Social Status of Texts and Modes of Textual Criticism by Peter L. Shillingsburg</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The main purpose of this paper is to ask questions about what an editor owes to the "social contract" when preparing a scholarly edition. A survey of specific issues in editorial debate preceding these questions can be found in Textual Criticism since Greg, A Chronicle, 1950-1985 by G. Thomas Tanselle. 1 In what follows I assume readers to some extent familiar with the history of that debate through the early 1980's as it applies to editing modern works. A historical background is important because various spokespersons for new social theories of textual criticism claim to be proponents of a "new historicism" replacing the principles of New Criticism underlying much textual criticism of the 1960s and 70s. 2 But many spokespersons for traditional historical criticism claim never to have lost track of history and think the new historicism is valid primarily because it returns to old principles, rejecting in the process some of the "aberrations" of recent critical theories, deconstruction particularly, in which history, including the author, seems to have disappeared. In dealing with the history of textual criticism and the newer ideas, I mention theorists by name occasionally, but I am not trying to survey any particular person's ideas; rather I am attempting to sort out different possible ways of looking at and using evidence in textual criticism—particularly along lines that might be regarded as a social theory of texts. Only God does not need to learn from experience (though my wife points out Eve was made second), and many writers to whom I refer, especially those exploring ideas of social influence, have changed their minds or modified their theories. I daresay they will again. As Morse Peckham has recently observed, "we have after all learned a great deal about something that has turned out to be a more difficult and confusing problem than was originally thought." 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The roots of modern textual criticism lie in classical and biblical textual scholarship which generally speaking assumes an ur-text, most often no longer extant. The editorial task in such situations is to reconstruct this ur-text, which is usually conceived to have been single and completed. If variant readings occur in competing modern editions of classical or biblical works, they usually reflect the difficulty editors have in sifting the evidence of extant derivative source texts and their differing assessments of the importance of specific problems. The differences seldom represent disagreements about the aim or purpose of editing, which is to recover or reconstruct the archetype or ur-text. When editors turned to textual criticism of modern works for which authorized texts were extant and for which even authorial materials such as manuscripts survived, the idea of an archetype or ideal text was not easily discarded. The comparative richness and authenticity of materials merely made it seem more likely that success could be achieved in editorial work. The concept of definitive texts seemed plausible. Generally speaking, the evolving editorial principles in the mid-twentieth century all assume that the literary work was the product of an author whose wishes concerning the text were to be paramount, and that the work should be edited in such a way as to produce the "established" text. The purpose of critical apparatuses was to show what the editor had done to produce the "established" text and to show what historical authorial forms of the text had been used as a basis for establishing the new text. 4 The editorial discussions of the twenty years preceding 1980 did not seriously question these assumptions, concentrating instead on issues related to "final intentions" (exploring distinctions between artistic and commercial intentions and debating whether the terms "final intentions" and "last intentions" were synonymous), 5 and on issues related to the treatment of accidentals (exploring distinctions between purely formal elements and "semi-substantives" 6 ). Some potentially interesting questions were raised about fulfilling authorial expectations (as opposed to authorial intentions), but even these did not clearly challenge the underlying assumption that the work belonged to the author and that the task of the editor was to serve the author. Most of the arguments on the side of serving the reader (objections to "barbed wire" editions, encouragement of modernized editions) 7 were dismissed as corrupting influences that pandered to popular audiences. Only one "reader service" principle has found general acceptance in American scholarly editing—the clear reading text, uninterrupted by footnotes or note indicators in the text. It is probable that this principle reflects more than anything else the result of belief in the established definitive text, the recovery of Pure Virgin Text. 8 A few relatively serious but largely unsuccessful attempts were made in that period to legitimize the role of publishing and production crews in the eyes of scholarly editors. That is, there were some attempts to show that secretaries, editors, compositors, and advisors often enough gave "good" advice and that sometimes their good effects had to be carried out in spite of the author's wishes or, in the case of absent or dead authors, without any indication of the author's wishes. One of the first such efforts, by James Thorpe, defined the work of art as merely "potential" until it was published. 9 The effect of this definition was to acknowledge the production process both as an aid to the author in finalizing the work and as a necessary fact of life enabling works of art to be known to readers. To support the first of these propositions, Thorpe argued from specific cases in which the author received needed help for which he was grateful. 10 The second proposition received its best support from Donald Pizer in a series of objections to the editing of texts (particularly Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage by Henry Binder and the Pennsylvania Edition of Dreiser's Sister Carrie ) in which the pursuit of purely authorial forms produced a text so different from the "cultural" artifact that had been known so long that, Pizer thought, serious confusion resulted about what the "real" text was and what it meant. 11 Philip Gaskell generated a considerable amount of press for Thorpe's basic premise in the editorial advice appended to his New Introduction to Bibliography and in his discussion of textual problems in Writer to Reader . Nevertheless, these editorial arguments remained author-centric, for they argue from the belief that the production process was an extension of authorial intention and merely fulfilled expectations for improvement of the work. Discussion of the "critical" nature of editing did, however, dethrone the concept of definitive texts. Its most visible manifestation was in the emblem of approval designed for CEAA sponsored editions, which reads "An Approved Text." The point was made that the emblem did not say " The Approved Text." To emphasize the point, the Committee on Scholarly Editions, the Modern Language Association's replacement for the CEAA, redesigned the emblem to say "An Approved Edition," a label meant to indicate that the editorial work was definitive, though the text itself was not necessarily so. However, the arguments about critical editions and about what part of them was or was not definitive did not go beyond an acknowledgement that different editors attempting to produce a text that best represented the author's intentions were confronted from time to time with inconclusive evidence and might exercise their judgment differently in those instances. 12 Whatever else they might disagree about, G. Thomas Tanselle wrote, scholarly editors were in general agreement that the aim of editing "is to discover exactly what an author wrote and to determine what form of his work he wished his public to have." 13 Most editors are well aware of the difficulties the idea of intention represents. Much of editorial debate, as well as the generation of new approaches to editing, is fueled by the problem of identifying intention and of using the concept responsibly in practical ways. Some editors are attracted by theories which attempt to avoid the problem of intention altogether. 14 It is not my purpose to rehearse any of these arguments. Nor do I mean to imply, in quoting Tanselle's remark about the general agreement among editors about the aim of editing (that it is to recover the author's intentions), that he was unaware of the underlying problem; indeed, he has written the most detailed discussion of it. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In the 1980s the tenor and range of editorial discussion suddenly changed and broadened. The changes have taken three primary modes, but all three derive impetus from the newer critical theories and particularly from new attention to the act of reading as well as social theories of communication. Morse Peckham had tried something similar in the early 70s with a behavioral model of communication, but it had little influence in the editing community. 16 The three new modes have certain things in common, but the differences lead to radically different editorial results. Two of the modes remain author-centric; the third is socio-centric. Ultimately, it is upon this third, the social view, that I wish to focus. The first of these new modes dubbed itself The New Scholarship; its most frequent spokesman has been Hershel Parker. 17 The reading and editing principle for this approach is to see the work in the context of its creation in order to best understand what the author was trying to do and to see that effort in relationship to what the author did do—the text which he produced. Parker questions a basic assumption of the New Critics, that works of art are unified and make sense and that the critic's job is to discover and reveal that unity and sense. Exploring examples of works in which he believes the author did not fulfil his own intentions, or where a decently fulfilled intention was marred by the author's own later revisions, Parker dethrones the text as the verbal icon. He argues that textual criticism pursued with the diligence and methods of "The New Scholarship," can reveal flawed texts with "adventitious" meanings resulting, not just from corruptions imposed by editors, but from the author's failure to embody a coherent intention in the produced text. While this approach is wide-ranging in its search for evidence of all sorts that may have influenced the creative process and while it is equally wide-ranging in its awareness of influences on reading and interpreting the work, it remains an author-centered approach. As such it is primarily a refinement of the more traditional (CEAA) modes, the primary difference being that it eschews "final intentions" per se as a touchstone for determining the authenticity of the text. Often, in the examples Parker provides, initial intention is preferred to final intentions, since by the time of "final" intentions, Parker says, the author may have ceased the creative mode and adopted an editorial mode. 18 The approach does bear a similarity to the other two new editorial modes in that it emphasizes a concept of the author in a social continuum that includes economics, politics, the psychology of creativity, and book production. It represents, however, a refinement of an authorial concept of authority, not a dismissal of it. 19 The second new editorial mode reacts strongly against that "single adequate established text" idea. The "multiple text" editors are not really new, but much new editorial debate emanates from their point of view. It is represented by Hans Gabler, editor of Joyce's Ulysses , and has roots in German editorial traditions as expressed early on by Hans Zeller. 20 I have adopted a good deal of this approach in my own editing of W. M. Thackeray. Its primary difference from previous editorial principles is its insistence on multiple or fluid texts. Authorial intention is recognized as less frequently monolithic than it is developing or changing—not only in a continuous progression but reaching stages of supposed completion or being transformed by conflicting or mutually exclusive intentions. In theory no particular preference is given to the final-intention text, as was the stated goal of CEAA editions, or to the text best representing the author's creative involvement with the work, as advocated by Parker in Flawed Texts . This position insists that the editorial aim is to present the multiple authorial texts—representative of developing or changed intentions—in such a way that the work may be read radially, each version in relationship to its other manifestations. Each authorial version of the work adds to the whole critical perception of what the author was doing and therefore of what the work means. Further, it allows for the view that a new authorial intention does not deprive an original or intermediate intention of any "authority"—it is merely different; all authorial intentions may be equally authoritative. It is much easier to think of the multiple-text concept in theory than it is to construct a multiple-text edition. "Everybody knows" texts are linear, not multiple, and "everyone" seems to want a text to be comfortable with. 21 But comfort and the practical problem of how to present the work of art are secondary to the significant issue here—that, except for unrevised texts, a single text does not adequately represent the work for scholarly study and that no single text can best represent the work for a critical reader—other single texts may be equally successful or useful. There have been several efforts to make practical multiple-text editions. In Hans Gabler's edition of Ulysses 22 one can see the "synoptic text" on left-hand pages tracing the development of authorial intention through a sequence of variant texts preceding the final fair copy used to set the first edition. The synoptic text superimposes all the preceding texts on one page through an elaborate, but decipherable, coding system. On the facing page the reader sees a linear text (clear reading text) representing the final manuscript version. The reader is encouraged to read the right-hand linear page in tandem with the synoptic or radial left-hand page. Michael J. Warren's Complete King Lear reprints two basic variant texts in parallel on facing pages with further variant versions indicated in marginalia. The idea is that the editor's critical preference, if he has one, is submerged in the arrangement of competing documentary textual forms. That the linear text is a limitation which scholarly editions can, to some extent, overcome was clearly apparent from the many iterations of the idea at the 1987 meeting of the Society for Textual Scholarship in New York. 23 As different as these various approaches to editing may seem, they have certain things in common. In each the work of art is seen as an authorial communication normally reaching its verbal form with minimal reference to book production, which is seen largely as an enabling process owing its allegiance to the author but frequently defaulting in that allegiance. Given this set of assumptions the critic is likely to see the interference of the publisher, editor and printer as legitimate only if it does not violate authorial intention or authorial practice. The production crew, from publisher to binder, is entrusted with translating the author's manuscript into print—or in more characteristic terms, entrusted with enabling the author's communication to be seen by many in the form of a printed book. The production process is necessary but is always on notice that it may fail its handmaiden role.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The third new approach is sociological; it is both radically different from and blandly similar to traditional approaches. Its primary spokesmen are Jerome McGann and D. F. McKenzie, whose writings on the subject have generated a good deal of excitement and confusion. The idea that authors live, breathe and have artistic being in a social complex that includes more than the words surviving on pages of manuscripts and printed books is not new. Most editors consider themselves historical researchers—it goes with being a textual critic. It is the arguments of the social contract, not the new evidence, that make the theory worth considering. But the confusion of argument has been and may for some time continue to be a major block to its influence. There are five and possibly six distinct arguments involved in the sociological approach. The first three are old and ultimately irrelevant if not contradictory; for years they have failed to influence the mainstream of scholarly editing. The fourth and fifth have grown out of critical theory and are sophisticated and well worth attention regardless of whether one adopts the conclusions of their present proponents. Most discussions of social texts, including the first three, have focused on the role of the production process in creating the work of art, but the concept is not limited to that subject, as the fourth and fifth arguments will demonstrate. Earlier I mentioned attempts by Thorpe, Gaskell, and Pizer to legitimize the production process. It will help to begin with another look at the basic arguments they use, for the first three arguments are really theirs, though McGann occasionally uses them, too. The first line of reason focuses on the idea that the production process is a necessary and desirable finishing or completion process in which the author turns to the publisher for help—and usually gets it. The argument is supported with examples of felicitous collaborations, all tending to show that the normal process of book production is a happy one. 24 I oversimplify somewhat, but the result of this argument is that, normally, the printed text is preferred as copy-text and, normally, the editor restores "pre-copy-text" forms only when demonstrable errors marred the process. Notice, however, that the justification in this argument is based on a critical assessment of the effect of changes. Regardless of whether the editor acknowledges it, such assessments depend on the aesthetic principles of the critic/editor. This is true even when the editor sets aside his own preferences and pursues what he takes to have been the author's. A basic premise of this argument is that the author's intention is only tentatively or provisionally recorded in the manuscript and that the collective experience and judgment of publishers and editors help the author fulfil his intentions—thus, authorial intention and editorial judgment combine for a better end product. The counter argument, that editorial interference is detrimental introducing corruptions, is often laced with examples of the silly results of production errors or angry remarks by disgruntled authors. 25 It leads to Greg's rationale of copy-text, so that authorial forms will be more likely to survive without these "corruptions." Later printed forms are adopted only where they are demonstrably authorial or are more than plausible corrections of manuscript errors. Though many editors would want to deny it, the basis for this counter argument is also a critical assessment of the effect of production crews (proofreaders, editors, compositors, and/or any other persons who help or hinder in the production of the published work). Scholarly editors who recognize the critical bases for judgment tend to say that rules cannot be made and each textual situation should be judged on its own merits—after all, they say, what is critical editing if it is not critical? A second argument for social texts, one used by both Donald Pizer and McGann, is very different because its logic denies the relevance of either authorial intention or critical judgment. The argument is that production and the resulting book is a part of history which has integrity of its own regardless of the author's or the readers' assessment of its success. Thus the fact that William Faulkner's Sartoris was published as it was becomes more important than might be the work that was to have been Flags in the Dust . In that particular case the enormous difference between the two versions, combined with the changed title, makes it easy to consider the two forms as completely different works for which it is silly to ask "which is the real X---." But when the difference is not so great and the name remains the same, as with Crane's Red Badge of Courage or Dreiser's Sister Carrie , the historical product, the first edition, has a validity or status that seems to some people to be threatened by editorial efforts to undo or redo the work of the original publication process. Hence the argument for the historical integrity of the first edition. In this argument many will recognize what has often been called documentary integrity. Historical integrity and documentary integrity need not, however, be the same thing. Tanselle, for example, describes the work of eclectic critical editors as historical, though they do not confine themselves to the readings of any single document. In addition, one might distinguish between the integrity of the document as it represents a historical event and its integrity as it is a physical unit connected to the author. 26 In the former the text of a document may be thought inviolable, while in the latter, the document itself is the important unit. The third argument asserts that the published texts have become culturally validated by the decades or centuries of readers who have known the work in that form. Readers and critics have come to know and in many cases love the work in this socialized form. If an editor changes the text so that the work means something new or different, these people and their sense of the cultural heritage will be confused, if not absolutely violated. This is true even though the changes are "restorations" of previously unpublished authoritative forms, which perhaps should have been a part of the original work save for the interference of "unauthoritative" influences. 27 Although, to my knowledge, literary editors do not use the second and third arguments (about the historicity and the cultural validation of texts) to support the idea that NO emendation should be undertaken, that is, strictly, the logical conclusion of both arguments. That a first edition is a historical document, that it was the basis for the work's first readers' acquaintance, and that it can still so serve new readers are unquestionable propositions. That an emended edition would misrepresent the integrity of the historical document is also true—though not necessarily important. It would be ludicrous, however, to expect all students of a text to read only the first edition or some other "authoritative" edition that had comparable legitimacy—such as "the author's revised edition." One could, with the argument concerning cultural validation, opt for editions that were straight reprints (unedited) with the idea that the linguistic text, more or less as it was first published, is what has been validated. But as soon as emendations are introduced, the center of this argument for "historical integrity" is weakened and, in fact, some other notion of integrity has replaced it. Social contract theorists, or editorial theorists inclined to accept a social validation for texts, such as Thorpe, Pizer, McGann, and McKenzie, may have tended to attack the "Greg/Bowers" or authorial intention editorial theories in order to make room for their own. In a sense, editors are in competition for the attention of readers—each wants readers, scholars, and critics to think his edition is the "standard" edition. Sometimes, therefore, arguments are used against other propositions instead of for an alternative proposition. The idea of historical integrity and cultural validation may be primarily arguments against the authority of authorial intention rather than for a social theory of texts. It is unfortunate that these arguments are used in this way for it confuses the issue to argue that the production process is good because it helps (i.e., authors need help and textual critics can judge when that has happened) and that the production process freezes and or validates whatever came out (i.e., authors get what they get, sorry, judgment has nothing to do with it). The fourth and fifth arguments for social texts are much more interesting and sophisticated and provide the proper ground for serious consideration of a social contract theory. The fourth argument focuses again on the production process. But rather than saying that editors and publishers help authors to implement their intentions in a physical book, or that there is an antiquarian integrity to the document containing the text, this approach sees the production process as a cultural phenomenon without which books do not exist. The influence of production on the book does not begin when the author hands a completed manuscript to the publisher; it begins when the author raises his pen for the first word of a work intended for publication, because of a consciousness of the way books gets published. Publishers, too, are only part of an even larger phenomenon that includes language and usage and everything that forms the sociological context within which authors are enabled to write and can hope to be understood. Any legal contract which the author signs with a publisher is, in this view, merely a confirmation of a predetermined contract that exists, whether acknowledged or not, among authors, publishers, and readers. Publishers, therefore, are not primarily handmaidens to authorship exercising helpful servant roles, which they may fail to do well; they are, instead, part of the authoritative social complex that produces works of art. They are a fact of life that cannot be "edited out" of the text any more than the effects of an author's breakfast and subsequent indigestion can be edited out. There is no tangible support for this point of view. We are asked to acknowledge a higher order of historical determinism that operates regardless of individual intentions. We all know this in our bones, perhaps. We all see it working in "movements"—be they political, moral, social, or aesthetic. The author becomes the pawn of time—as we all are. If one does not feel this argument in his bones, I suppose it will not be very convincing. There is a fundamental shift in the concept of authority involved in this argument. Rather than judging the effect of publication on the author's words, this argument simply vests authority for the text in a socio-economic environment which "contains" the author's initiating creative activity and the publisher's ongoing process of moving composition into production. The textual changes introduced by the production process are accepted by the editor, not because they are better, not because they are historical, not because they are sacred, but because they are social—representing a necessary bio-socioeconomic relationship between author, publisher, and audience (including the editor). The result of this argument is that the printed text is preferred as copy-text, emendation is discouraged but allowed to complete or correct the socializing process, and the critical apparatus is seen as an important record of social/cultural dynamics. 28 Intrinsic to this argument, with its redefinition of textual authority, is a concept of transferring authority from the author to the publisher. Different theorists would argue in different ways about how this transfer takes place; it is different, perhaps, for every author and work and, therefore, looks different to each editor. The evidence of transfer is not new, though the conclusion that the author transfers authority over the text to the publisher when he "submits" the manuscript is, perhaps, new in editorial theory. It is, of course, a quite old idea in commercial practice. Editors who use this argument are, however, usually comfortable with it only as long as the production process changed insignificant details or "improved" the work. When actual damage resulted from the publication process, the theory ceases to be appealing and recourse is taken to another. A very interesting discussion of the various attitudes toward the author's "submission" to the publisher and the relationships that they represent was presented by James L. W. West at the Society for Critical Exchange. 29 He made a potentially useful distinction between attempts by the production crew to enhance the author's "active" intentions and its attempts to enhance the "programmatic" intentions, terms borrowed from Michael Hancher. 30 West's position was that only limited transfers of authority may occur and that it is part of the scholarly editor's duty to determine which were legitimate fulfilments of active intention and which were illegitimate attempts at programmatic changes. It is clear that the details of an individual case would influence any editor's assessment of the process. The argument in the hands of a "social contract" theorist would tend, however, to acknowledge the authority of the production process in all cases. McGann uses this argument to deal with Byron's works, in A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism , but he is reluctant to apply it to Shelley's works in which the author was judged to have been more clearly in control of the effect of punctuation and the publication process was judged to have marred that control rather than enhanced it. 31 The fifth argument adds several new dimensions. Rather than focusing on the production process and its socializing influence, this argument focuses on the physical artifact that results. It does not argue that the "known" text is part of our cultural heritage to which we have become accustomed and which has influenced so much critical debate in the form it was produced. Rather it says that the physical object is a version of the work that itself generates meaning. It argues that the linguistic text generates only a part of the meaning of a book; its production, its price, its cover, its margins, its type font all carry meaning that can be documented. 32 In short, the physical book, of which the linguistic text is but a part, is important not because we have become accustomed to it, and not merely because it is a part of history, but because its form and historical entry into the culture determined the cultural acceptance it received. For example, the elegant first edition of Byron's Don Juan was received as a witty and spirited performance, but reviewers of the cheap pirated editions called it an immoral travesty. The same verbal text in differing physical formats meant different things. 33 When the fact that the pirated cheap "immoral" texts were the ones that most people read and that made Byron's "literary reputation and popularity," is added, we have a very complex textual situation. The implications of this phenomenon to the social contract editorial school is that the physical books, as products of the social context and contract, are physically the works of art. There is a basic validity to this argument that I think few persons would deny. One's reaction to a work is conditioned by his knowledge of a variety of factors having little if anything to do with the linguistic text itself. Book designers know this well; cheap literature in small type and double columns is printed on newsprint or other inexpensive paper. Lurid covers indicate something about how the publisher hopes readers will react to the text and may also indicate what kind of reader is being addressed. Likewise, hard covers, ample margins, generous leading, and heavy paper often imply the social status of the publisher and of the readers. They may also imply the literary value or durability of the "work of art" thus produced. N. N. Feltes, in a recent discussion of W. M. Thackeray's Henry Esmond pursues this line of investigation. He argues that, by its physical format (a Victorian three decker), its price (36 shillings—out of the reach of most ordinary book buyers), its genre (historical fiction), and its publisher (George Smith, an executive member of the Bookseller's Association) Esmond represents "the establishment" and is unlike Thackeray's earlier parts-issued Vanity Fair and Pendennis which, by their price, formats, and publisher represented the proletarian economic revolution. 34 This is a very interesting approach to the meaning of Esmond , bringing into serious question the effect of reprinting the novel in modern dress (one volume, modern type font) and obscuring by that process these meaningful elements of the first edition. This is true even though Feltes' conclusion, that Thackeray's hand was limited by these "establishment" forces and that the meaning of Esmond is "determined" by the social contract over which Thackeray had no control, is not convincing. 35 It is one thing to recognize the implications of the physical embodiment of a linguistic text, quite another to identify the text in its physical format as the work of art, and still another to say that the social and economic context within which the work was published determined what the author would or could do. There may be some truth in all of these propositions, but it would be very hard to make a rule out of them that would apply well to many texts. In some ways this argument sounds rather familiar; in 1952, for example, Gordon Ray made much the same case in "The Importance of Original Editions" but drew a different conclusion, since Ray saw the cultural history of books as external to authorial intention and as an added, rather than substitute, interest. 36 The concept that physical books have integrity and meaning in themselves bears more thinking about. The meanings referred to can be not only in addition to the linguistic text, but separate from or unified with that text. They can be meanings of which the author was unconscious or meanings the author consciously exploits or manipulates. There are many well-known instances of authors consciously seeking to enhance their text by controlling the physical form of the works: the green cover of Leaves of Grass , the shaped lines of George Herbert's "Easter Wings," the private limited printing in 1926 of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom , Blake's lithographed combinations of text and illustration. Other cases are known of authors manipulating or taking advantage of reader reactions to physical formats: Thackeray's references to the jaundiced yellow covers and Trollope's remarks about the third volume of the novel. But for the most part authors do not control these matters and the "meanings" or implications of the physical text, if anything, reveal unconsciously things about the author or publisher—rather like dramatic irony where the physical book is the situational context of the linguistic text, though sometimes the implications may not be ironic. Readers, by and large, of classic texts in new editions are taught to ignore the extra-linguistic contexts of the physical books in the same way that theatre goers are taught to ignore the stage relation to the audience through a willing suspension of disbelief. Thus we read Tennyson's In Memoriam in the cut version in the Norton Anthology and "understand" the poem as if its placement had nothing to do with how we read the poem or what the poem means (willing suspension of disbelief, indeed). The social contract theory asks readers to pay attention to the physical setting of "authoritative" versions (not the Norton Anthology ) of the physical work. Before proceeding, let us summarize for convenience the five arguments: 1. Production crews improve works of art—the editor and critic recognize this improvement by judging the results. 2. Publication is a historical fact—emendation would violate the historical event represented by the published text. 3. Years of use have validated the familiar text, it has been appropriated by the cultural heritage—emendation would confuse people. 4. Publication is an integral and necessary part of the social act of producing works of art; production influences pervade composition from its inception and should be accepted as a social fact—part of the definition of "literary work of art." 5. The physically produced work is the work of art, its physical form reflects social contexts revealing the true character of the work. The most important difference between the social contract approaches to textual problems and previous editorial principles lies in the radically altered definition of textual authority that they offer. Whereas earlier principles for critical editing accepted without question the authority of the author, differing primarily in determining what the authorial intention was, the social contract principle denies the author the pride of place and substitutes the social event that produced the book as the authority. In that complex, the author is merely one of several authorizing forces; authorial intention may still have relevance to editorial practice but it is no longer the central focus; other "larger" issues enter the equation. At first, looking primarily at the first three arguments for "social texts," it would appear that the principle of social contract would eschew critical editing because those arguments identify the work of art with the commodity offered for sale, the socialized product. Perhaps some of its adherents would make that identification. In its most rigid form, this principle would require that printed texts should be chosen as copy-texts and that emendations should not be allowed. But if those two arguments are disposed of, as perhaps they should be, and the last two arguments assessed critically, we can see that a concern for authorial meaning is merely different from the concerns emphasized here, not a concern denied by them. There is, perhaps, a sixth argument relevant to a social theory of texts, though in some ways it may be merely the extrapolation of the fourth. Its summary for the chart above would be: 6. The social determinism of texts . It may be that this concept has nothing to do with a social contract theory of editing, but it does seem to underlie a good deal of the thinking behind the other five arguments I have been trying to sort out. I try to approach it merely from the point of view of a scholar wanting to know everything I can about the work, its author, and its historical and linguistic context in an attempt to understand it as a whole. This idea concerns the importance of the entire bio-socio-economic context in determining the work of art. If we do not understand this idea thoroughly, it may appear to have unqualified power or authority over texts, leaving us to conclude simply that whatever text was produced by the publishing contract is the right text. That conclusion appears contrary to any editorial principle in which authority is defined as author-centric. This idea is alluded to by McGann when, in reviewing McKenzie's 1985 Panizzi Lectures, he speaks of "the people who belong to the text." 37 The usual approach is to see things the other way round: the text that belongs to the author or to the publisher or to the reader. That has been the conventional way of seeing "authority." That is the "old" way of shaping editorial policy—by reference to those persons who authorize or determine what the text should be. McGann and McKenzie seem to make the text and the social forces it represents larger than any person. They include the text itself as a part of the "contract" or the complex of social, political, and economic forces that determine life. Social determinism becomes literary determinism. The language speaks the author; the social complex makes the book. The book is not "a container or transmitter of meaning"; it is "a meaningful agent itself." 38 And what it has come to mean is not within the author's or any other person's control. N. N. Feltes, in the discussion of Esmond mentioned above, concludes from his study of the "establishment" elements in the book that Thackeray was forced into uncharacteristic, reactionary meanings—that authorship is largely determined by economic forces and that these forces reduce or replace the play of individual judgment. 39 The idea of socially determined texts may best be understood by asking several related questions designed to clarify the way in which a definition of authority controls editorial decisions and to highlight the difference between author-centric and socio-centric approaches. What happens when the contracted socializing process violates the confidence or trust which the author unwittingly placed in it? Is the social contract or the author's wishes of greater authority? Similarly, what is the status of the "contract" when the socializing process takes place without the author's consent, as in posthumous publications? Is there to be a presumption that the socializing process is proper, legitimate and good unless something can be shown to be wrong with it? If the answer to this last question is yes, it follows that publisher's punctuation would be preferred to author punctuation. One could ask why that must be so—what is the applicable rationale for copy-text and what distinction is made in that rationale between accidentals and substantives. None of the theorists proposing arguments on behalf of the social contract seem to have a well-developed or convincing rationale for dealing with accidentals. What happens when the succession of reprints that perpetuates and validates the cultural heritage perpetuates demonstrable flaws? 40 Is a restoration of text which creates an unfamiliar version disallowed because it violates the cultural artifact? What happens when the authorial intention is weak or flawed but is substantively improved by editorial advice? 41 Is the social contract, or in this case collaboration, acceptable only when the results are judged acceptable? Similarly, what happens when the authorial intention was strong and unorthodox but is substantively weakened by the publication process? Does that prove that no contract exists? If the results can be judged unacceptable, then the criterion is aesthetic not contractual; there is no contract. And what if that impoverished text makes a cultural impact validated by large sales and broad influence? What happens when a text considered as a cultural object with meaning and significance derived from its physical form becomes re-objectified in new editions? Is each re-objectification a new version of the work worth editorial attention? No one, I think, would deny that each is worth attention as a fact of cultural history, but does that make each publication a part of what the work of art is from a critical point of view? If the answer is yes, how does it affect editorial policy? Listing out these questions and contemplating their possible answers suggests that the "social contract theory" is just as complex and variable as the author-centric approaches have been. It would therefore, I think, be short-sighted and narrow-minded to try to persuade editors that a social theory of texts with a definition of authority marginalizing the author is the only responsible way to edit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The common link of all these questions and of the theories available with which to answer them is the concept of authority. Authority is not something "out there" to be discovered and analyzed. It is a concept brought to the situation by the observer. It is whatever it is defined to be. The hesitation one has in answering these questions—and, therefore, of knowing whether authorial acts are determined or free—comes from the different definitions of authority implied by the way the questions state the supposed conditions. The idea that authority is not intrinsic or discovered in the textual problems but is, instead, brought to the problem by the editor to help evaluate the problem is not one I expect most persons to recognize immediately. 42 It is worth, therefore, a separate discussion of authority before we can get on properly with the questions I have just posed. The greatest obstacle to understanding differences in editorial principles and in particular to understanding the claims of the social contract is the word "authority." I think this is so not only because it is used to denote several different things, which users suppose to be clear from the context, but because it is an emotionally loaded word that grants approval; it is not cleanly descriptive. I would like to sort out various definitions of the word derived from its use to describe textual phenomena, show that it is used to indicate concepts at various levels of thinking, show that sometimes it is used as a specific description (as we use the word "yellow" in the phrase that is a yellow schoolbus) and other times as a comparative word (as we use the words "clear" and "clearer" with an eye-doctor to indicate which lens clarifies the eye chart better), and show how those things can be thought of separately from the approval or disapproval indicated by the words "authoritative" and "nonauthoritative." One meaning of authority is "deriving from the author." This usually means that a word, phrase, or point of punctuation can be shown to have been written or dictated by the author. Melville's "coiled fish" has authority; the compositor's "soiled fish" does not. Such words are said to have authority because we know they came from the author. One could call this specific kind of authority "primary authorial authority," which may sound redundant but is not when we consider other meanings for authority. An author's manuscript, of course, has primary authorial authority. So do the autograph alterations in proofs or setting-copies for revised editions and instructions in letters or notes to secretaries, compositors, or publishers. Another meaning for authority is "having a demonstrable, though not precisely known, relation to the author." This usually means that it is generally known that the author did revise or proofread the text which is said, therefore, to have authority. The specific words, phrases or punctuation that have "primary authorial authority" are not known. One could call this "secondary authorial authority." Instances of secondary authorial authority can be seen in a scribal copy or typescript made from a lost manuscript or a magazine publication made from a lost revised carbon typescript where the fact of authorial revision is not in dispute but the details of specific revisions cannot be recovered. Another meaning for authority is "deriving from a document with 'primary' or 'secondary authorial authority.'" This usually means that the text referred to is the closest known text to one the author wrote or otherwise supervised. It does not mean that the author necessarily had anything to do with the typesetting of proofreading. This could be called "primary documentary authority" to distinguish it from later editions. Instances of "primary documentary authority" would be the so-called good quartos of Shakespeare's plays or any first published appearance of a book for which prepublication forms have disappeared and for which it is reasonable to suppose that setting copy was the author's manuscript or fair copies made from documents with "primary authorial authority." Another meaning for authority is "having a precedent in a historical document." This usually means that the text, as preserved in physical documents that may be (and probably are) corrupt, has an unknown relation to the author and may or may not preserve the authorial forms as successfully as other documents with similar characteristics. An instance of this kind of authority would be the existence of say three syndicated magazine versions of a story no longer extant in manuscript. The differences between the versions probably originated in the composing rooms of the various publications. There is no other "authoritative" source for the story, hence these three documents are the authorities. This could be called "radial documentary authority." Supposing that one of the three documentary authorities corresponds in the pattern of punctuation more closely to the patterns familiar in the author's surviving manuscript, that document may be said to have "more authority" than the other two, at least with regard to punctuation. Notice that this brings into play the word "authority" in a comparative rather than a descriptive sense. Here the word is used evaluatively and reflects critical judgment in analyzing punctuation patterns. It would be more accurate to say that this one document is "more likely to be authoritative in its punctuation than the other two" than to say that "it is more authoritative," and it would be better yet to have a word other than authority or authoritative to describe what is being said. Perhaps it would be wise to revert to the terms "more or less sophisticated" and "more or less corrupt" to indicate our sense of the relative amount of intentional and unintentional alteration introduced by compositors or other production personnel. Another instance of "documentary authority" illustrates yet another way in which the word authority is used evaluatively. If one has a "difficult" reading in a text with "secondary authorial authority" or even with "primary documentary authority" which has been altered to an "easy" reading in a purely derivative "nonauthoritative" text, editors sometimes resist the temptation to adopt the easier reading by "sticking to authority." This use of the word places value on the tangible text over the critical conjecture of later compositors or modern editors. The possibility that the physical text may be wrong can never be proven, though there are some difficult readings that no one (so far) has tried to defend; but "Mne Serephim" in Blake's "The Book of Thel," "spitting" rather than "splitting" in Shakespeare's Henry VIII (2.4.181), and the auctioneer who "repeated his discomposure" in Thackeray's Vanity Fair are just a few of myriads of cases where the editor is tempted to supply conjecture rather than "stick to authority." Just as the documentary reading cannot be proven to be wrong, so the conjecture can never be established to be correct (if it could it would cease to be conjecture). The point here is that the word authority is used evaluatively to defend an action taken rather than descriptively to indicate the nature of a situation. It would be just as accurate to say of the editor who "stuck to authority" that he knuckled under to the tyranny of copy-text or that he is a very conservative editor or even that he is an unimaginative editor. All these terms are evaluative and not indicative of anything demonstrable. What can be said specifically and objectively of "Mne," "spitting," and "repeated his discomposure" is that they occur in texts with "primary" or "secondary documentary authority"— that and no more; anything else would be a matter of judgment. All of the foregoing definitions reflect an author-centric view of textual criticism. Especially in the use of "authority" comparatively, one can see the controlling influence of an attitude of respect for authorial autonomy with regard to txets. There is nevertheless considerable room for disagreement within these views. Depending on the stress one puts on the authority of one document over another, depending on the sense of historical or documentary integrity one espouses, one can within these definitions be a documentary editor or a critical editor. 43 Hershel Parker invokes yet another definition of authority when he limits it to the product of the act of creativity during the time that creativity as he defines it is in fact going on. As the author works he imbues the work with his intention and perhaps finds within the work the work's intention, which then takes over and becomes the controlling force of the work. That controlling force becomes the "authority" of the work and its intention— and it therefore becomes the editor's aim to edit the work in accordance with that authority. To do so, he may have to reject a good deal of editorial tinkering that the author may have done to the text after he had lost the creative urge that produced the work. A totally different level of meaning is invoked when one asks "by what authority does the editor emend the text?" Here the word "authority" has no direct reference to the source of a specific reading; whether a word began with the author or a compositor or whether it is in a text with primary or secondary documentary authority are irrelevant questions. What this question asks is, what is the critical theory about works of art that leads you to believe that the author is the ultimate source of authority? Why, for example, is it that the text you are trying to present need not have "better" readings, why is it sufficient that they be authorial? Until a person is willing to consider the definition of authority at this level there is no point in wasting words about social theories of text or about the aesthetics of textual criticism. As long as the author-centric view is the only legitimate view, James Thorpe and Jerome McGann will remain outsiders whose editorial principles need not be taken seriously. It is painful to consider the question, "by what authority does the editor emend the text?" because a serious consideration of the answer requires examination of fundamental assumptions about things that turn out to be problematical rather than solid and objective. As long as one remains settled inside the author-centric world of ideas, the concept of authority is very useful practically in the business of producing scholarly editions, documentary authority is a firm resting place, primary authorial authority is like being in clover. The problem with new editorial discussions is that they are successfully forcing thought to be expended on this higher level of authority. They are succeeding because it has become de rigueur to be self-conscious about our critical theories. In order for it to be acceptable to consider McGann's or McKenzie's editorial theories, one must put in abeyance the definitions of authority I have surveyed above (put them on hold, so to speak), shift gears so as to consider the larger questions of authority which a "social theory of texts" demands, and anticipate the possibility that one's author-centric definitions of the materials of textual criticism will have counterparts reflecting a different higher level concept of authority. It appears to me, therefore, that the major question, the question of authority, may usually be argued and settled before the evaluation of specific evidence concerning the composition and production of a given text takes place. Editors may approach a text with preconceived ideas, about the authority of the author or the social contract or the roles of publishers, that will predispose them to interpret the evidence in certain ways. In general terms the evaluation of specific evidence may not be determined by its intrinsic meaning—that which "the facts cry out"—but rather by some previous determination concerning the nature of the work of art. For example, it could be argued that Dreiser's friend Arthur Henry gave him bad advice about Sister Carrie that was designed to avoid problems Henry himself had encountered but were not designed to help Dreiser fulfil his own artistic intentions with regard to the novel. One editor will say, "save Dreiser from his misguided friend," another will say, "Henry is a fact of life, his advice was taken, the book that Sister Carrie would have become without his intervention is not recoverable." It could further be argued that Mrs. Page, the publisher's wife, influenced the book even more significantly than Henry, since by her insistence Sister Carrie was suppressed, though technically it was published. She did to the book something that can be measured in the circulation and reception of the book. Our first editor would say, "rescue Dreiser's book from the publisher's influence"; the second might say, "the publisher is a fact of life without which Sister Carrie would never have become a suppressed book—along with all the meaning that condition adds to the book." My point is not to say which is right but to question the proposition that the facts of publication history "cry out" for a specific treatment. What an editor will see as appropriate treatment will depend on a prior commitment to a definition of textual authority. Seen from a sociological perspective, the specific evidence of the social context will "cry out" for attention and recognition as legitimate operants or influences in the production of texts. Those facts will cry equally loudly for a place in the reader's interpretation and appreciation of the work as representation not only of the aesthetics of its time but of the economics and politics of its time. The word "legitimate" is not exactly right; the fact that production (the world of publishers, editors and printers) is an acknowledged, normal part of the creation of book texts makes the participation of production staffs an integral part of the creation of the book, of the work of art. It is argued that authors write with the expectation of receiving production help in completing their art; therefore, the help they get is a "legitimate" operant or influence. Further, given this essentially marxist orientation and principles, an edition that systematically eliminates the influences of all contracting parties but the author (such as was goal in the Pennsylvania edition of Dreiser's Sister Carrie ) will be seen as partial, distorted, and misrepresentative of the historical, socio-economic and political event that produced it. Marxist critics take the social implications of texts more seriously than most critics. In so far as they recognize the implications of editorial principles aimed at recovering the author's final intentions by eliminating the "external influences," they can be nothing less than disappointed and will more likely be enraged by what they will see as the desecration of texts. For the marxist critic, the editor's pursuit of the pure virgin text is a hypocritical, evil coverup, unless it be an ignorant naive game. The general rules or orientations that tend to predetermine how the evidence will be used often are forced upon the evidence. One can have rules, said A. E. Housman about editors nearly 100 years ago, but they will lead you wrong. That is, when an a priori set of principles leads to a mechanical or rigid manipulation of the facts of a given case, the potential provided by the overall view for generating exciting new insights is hobbled by an unexciting tyranny. A look at specific cases will illustrate the uses and potential abuses of the fact that a general orientation predetermines the use of evidence. But first let me reiterate the basic questions that stimulated this discussion and encapsulate the competing and apparently irreconcilable general principles involved. The questions are, what is textual integrity (the unity and honesty and authenticity of the text of a work of literary art)? Is it possible for there to be more than one "legitimate" integrity for a single work? What is meant by textual authority? What should it be? Do editors influence interpretations (how do they do it, should they do it, can it be avoided)? These questions arise because traditional consensus about the real nature of works of art has been challenged by a competing notion that appears antithetical, and may in fact be antithetical, to it. Persons in our profession can no longer assume that everyone sees the work from a common point of view, but many of us act as though we still should be able to agree. I do not mean we can no longer count on standard interpretations; I mean we no longer agree about the nature of the thing we call a literary work. I also do not mean we no longer agree on the canon or on which works are literary; I mean we no longer agree about the foundation of words and linguistic meaning. One of these notions, the more traditional one, is that the work of art is a personal communication from an author to an audience. The assumption is that when the author writes he has something he wishes to communicate; when he puts words on the page he is trying to create certain effects in readers; when an author has developed the artistic and technical skill to create works of art, he is in control and does things deliberately. These assumptions I would call a commonsense approach because generally speaking people think that way about their own speech acts and because that is what I am trying to do right now. This view accords with the editorial principle of pursuing authorial intention and with the critical hermeneutical principles discussed by E. D. Hirsch, Jr., in Validity in Interpretation . And this general notion of authorship views the production process of turning manuscripts into books as a service to the author helping him get his creative effort into a form for general dissemination. The apparently antithetical competing notion is that the work of art is social rather than individual. Rather than the artist using language to create a new work of art, the language speaks the artist. Rather than the production crew being assistants in the author's effort to communicate, the publishing world is a cultural agency which employs authors to aid them in providing society with works of art. The actualizing or domesticating of art for society is the production function. Both the author and the production personnel are to some extent cultural puppets, products of their time producing inevitable art. The way we know that what came out of the process was inevitable is that something else did not materialize instead. The function of criticism in this view is to interpret the texts as cultural artifacts in their historical settings. If nothing else, this survey of competing views of editing has convinced me even more that editing is a critical enterprise that not only involves criticism but is in fact a form of literary criticism. Criticism is interpretation; editions, like other interpretations, can be supported by evidence and argument, but they cannot be proven or validated. They are not definitive. Consequently, the interpretation of the work, which an edition is, must have its literary critical basis clearly acknowledged by the editor for the edition user. I believe no theorist should say that his method is the only responsible one, though I think it is possible to discover that some methods are irresponsible. One very interesting idea arising from D. F. McKenzie's remarks about the object that is the work of art is that the physical object that is the scholarly edition changes and enriches the work much more than it preserves or restores it. In critical editing, not only is the edited text itself one which never existed before, it is surrounded by alter-texts and related historical materials which have never before been attached to it physically. Scholarly editions invite a kind of reading no other textual form comes close to suggesting. As McGann has put it, scholarly editions invite the reader to read linearly, radially, and spacially all at the same time. 44 Scholarly editors like to think of themselves as historians and preservers when in fact they are the most progressive innovators of new texts and new contexts in the profession. More questions become possible now: What is the textual editor's responsibility to the author and to the social contract? Is that one responsibility or two? If two, how can the editor balance them? I would like to think it is possible to identify and respond to both responsibilities. But an extended examination of a specific actual case is the only way to demonstrate how that can be done. To do so will lead to assessments of a related question: What is the importance of authorial intention and of the social contract to literary criticism? I originally intended to include a lengthy discussion at this point of Thackeray's Henry Esmond as an editorial problem to be considered from both the authorial and the social points of view as a trial answer to these questions. I believe, however, this discussion is long enough without that attempt. My essay on Esmond is in my nearly completed book on Thackeray and his publishers. I believe most editors can develop their own answers just as well in reference to specific editorial problems with which they are familiar—provided of course that as A. E. Housman stipulates they have brains not pudding in their heads. One way to balance awareness of cultural context, including the ministrations of production crews, with a respect of authorial intentions was suggested by Fredson Bowers in his address to the Society for Textual Scholarship in 1987: "As a textual critic I am inclined to suggest that awareness of this phenomenon should encourage an editor to remove from the text as much as possible of this non-authorial accretion when it is actually of no material aid in assisting the latest original authorial intention " (my italics). 45 The suggestion is worth pondering though there may be some contortion involved in believing original authorial intentions to be also final intentions and though the process limits critically the force of any supposed "social contract." There are serious, legitimate differences in point of view in these matters. We may need, for certain important and rich works of literary art, several scholarly editions: the edition representing the author's final intentions, the edition representing the historical event of first publication, the edition representing the thorough revision—each would possibly affect the student in a different way. None would of itself be THE work of art. At the very least, the facts of controversial cases point to the need for editors to be clear-eyed and honest about the particular principles they follow and to clearly identify those principles and the kind of edition they produce. It is not enough to call it a scholarly edition—even if it is approved by the MLA. Ultimately, it is an impossible quest to produce "the edition that conveys the author's most comprehensive intentions"; what we can hope to do is produce "the edition that conveys the author's intentions most comprehensively." 46</field>

I (1987), 171-172. 4 There is no clear or universal notion about what an "established text" is or what has been established by a "scholarly" edition. Sometimes it means no more than "standard" edition, identified as such in the literary histories and general bibliographies. "Establishing" what the relevant documents are for editing a text (the bibliography), or "establishing" what relation exists between the documents and the author or other "authorizing agents," or even "establishing" what textual cruces remain problematical even after much research are all relatively straightforward concepts. But to "establish" a text, meaning to determine what words and accidentals constitute the "real" text of a work, is not very clear at all. 5 See particularly Tanselle's survey of "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 34 (1981), 23-65. Tanselle groups these ideas slightly differently, but the point he made in 1981 remains valid, that editors tended to return to these "small number of basic problems" (p. 59). He adds, more recently, that regardless of how much they have been rehearsed, there "will be no end to debates over these issues, because they are genuinely debatable; and the process of debate is the way in which each generation of editors thinks through the questions for itself" ("Historicism and Critical Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 39 [1986], 45). 6 See Tom Davis, "The CEAA and Modern Textual Editing," Library , 32 [1977], 61-74, esp. 63-69; and Peter Shillingsburg, "Key Issues in Editorial Theory" Analytical and Ennumerative Bibliography , 6 [1982], 3-16. 7 See Lewis Mumford, "Emerson Behind Barbed Wire," ( New York Review of Books , 18 January 1968); Peter Shaw, "The American Heritage and Its Guardians," American Scholar , 45 (1974-75), 733-775; and Herbert Davis' review of Studies in Bibliography , 15 in Review of English Studies 12 (1961), 324-325. See also James Thorpe's comments on the subject in Watching the P's &amp; Q's, Editorial Treatment of Accidentals (University of Kansas, Library Series, 38, 1971), pp. 21-23. 8 This principle was pushed very hard by the CEAA: "Whenever possible, clear text is to be preferred, since in many editions it can then serve the interest of both scholars and general readers" ( The Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures [New York: Modern Language Association, 1972], p. 8). English scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page, indicating, tacitly, a greater modesty about the "established" text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text. 9 Principles of Textual Criticism (San Marino: Huntington Library, 1972), 37-38. 10 "The Treatment of Accidentals" in The Principles of Textual Criticism , pp. 131-170. Thorpe quotes confessions by the following authors to the effect that they did not know or did not care about punctuation and appealed to others, including their publishers, for help with punctuation: Thomas Gray, Wordsworth, Byron, J. F. Cooper, Charlotte Brontë, Sherwood Anderson, Timothy Dexter, and W. B. Yeats. He does not ask whether an author's plea for help in these matters is sufficient proof that the author's own system is in fact inadequate, misleading, or less preferrable than the augmented or regularized punctuation received—he merely assumes it to be so. In the same year, the CEAA Statement of Editorial Principles , assessing the same kind of evidence, also fails to discuss this question but merely assumes the opposite: "what an author wrote is to be preferred in most circumstances to what a publisher or printer imposed upon that writing" (p. 4). 11 Review of the Pennsylvania Sister Carrie , in American Literature , 53 (January 1982), 731-737. 12 It is not always simple to make categories of variants according to who is responsible for them. Corruptions, demonstrable errors, naturally need to be weeded out. Authorial revisions usually are adopted. But what is to be done with feasible variants not clearly authorial? When the evidence for their "authority" is equivocal, the variants are said to be "indifferent." In such cases editors are faced with an arbitrary decision to be explained in a way similar to this note from Edgar F. Harden's edition of Thackeray's Henry Esmond : "Although 'was numerous' can be interpreted as a compositorial misreading or correction [of 'very handsom' which is squeezed in nearly illegibly in the margin], this edition accepts the changed reading as authorial. Similarly, it accepts the change from 'her newly adopted son' to 'the newly adopted son' as authorial." There is no elaborate explanation of the reason for this decision; indeed, what would be the point? There is no overwhelming reason to choose one way or the other—only that a choice had to be made. 13 "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," Studies in Bibliography , 29 (1976), 167. He repeats this idea in "Recent Editorial Discussion and the Central Questions of Editing," p. 67, where he says the aim of editing is "to emend the selected text so that it conforms to the author's intention." 14 McGann, for example, seems attracted to the social contract because it sidesteps the problem of authorial intention ( A Critique of Modern Textual Editing [1984], pp. 28-94, passim). Some documentary editors reject the principles of critical or eclectic editing for the same reason. 15 "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," pp. 167-211. See also Morse Peckham, "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," Proof , 1 (1971), 122-155; Peter Shillingsburg, Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age (1986), pp. 31-43; and James McClaverty, "The Concept of Authorial Intention in Textual Criticism," Library , 6 (1984), 121-138. 16 Morse Peckham, "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," pp. 122-155. 17 Hershel Parker, "The 'New Scholarship': Textual Evidence and Its Implications for Criticism, Literary Theory, and Aesthetics," Studies in American Fiction 9 (Autumn 1981): 181-197. 18 Parker's arguments are interesting and important because of the thorough research and sheer quantity of detailed information he brings to bear on his analysis of the genesis of texts. (See, however, the thoughtful queries about his conclusions raised in Paul Baender's review, "Megarus ad lunam: Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons ," Philological Quarterly , 64 [Fall 1985], 439-457. 19 See also the discussion of authority below in section IV. 20 Hans Zeller, "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," Studies in Bibliography , 28 (1975), 231-264. 21 Edmund Wilson wanted one to take in his pocket on a plane trip. Peter Shaw wanted Emerson's journals "just as they were." A reviewer of my Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age claims I don't address the question of whether "readers will be comfortable" with a multi-text edition. 22 3 vols. (1984.) 23 The idea of multiple-texts or "versions" is not necessarily author-centric, though until recently it has been supported primarily by the argument that multiple or developing authorial intentions cannot be adequately represented in a single text. Jerome McGann, reviewing Gabler's edition of Joyce's Ulysses , (" Ulysses as a Postmodernist Text: The Gabler Edition," Criticism , 27 [Summer 1985], 283-305) calls for an additional edition that would represent the "continuous production text" of the work in a way similar to Gabler's "continuous compositional text." Gabler, in the "synoptic" left-hand page, provides a genetic record of authorial revision during composition leading up to what would be fair copy. On the facing right-hand page, he presents the "established" text, described as what should have been printed in the first edition. McGann would like to see an edition beginning with the actual first edition text and tracing the "version" created by subsequent publications. 24 These include Charlotte Brontë's letter of thanks to George Smith for taking care of the punctuation of Jane Eyre (C. Brontë complained of Thomas Newby's very shoddy handling of the punctuation of Wuthering Heights two months later). Byron apparently received significant and appreciated help from his publisher, John Murray. Other help in the form of editorial advice is educed either in favor of good working relations or against, depending on the writer's evaluation of the results: Maxwell Perkins' influence on Hemingway and Wolfe, George Meredith's influence on Thomas Hardy, Bulwer Lytton's influence on the ending of Great Expectations , Dickens' influence on Elizabeth Gaskell—Meredith and Dickens in these cases working as publishers. 25 These include John Dryden's remark, "The Printer is a beast and understands nothing I can say to him of correcting the press," Tennyson's milder remark to his publisher, "I think it would be better to send me proof twice over—I should like the text to be as correct as possible," Mark Twain's remark to W. D. Howells about a proofreader improving his punctuation, that he knew "more about punctuation in two minutes than any damned bastard of a proof-reader can learn in two centuries." (These examples are quoted by James Thorpe in Watching the P's &amp; Q's , pp. 4-7.) Examples of nonsense readings abound in the apparatuses of most scholarly editions, though one should note that while production crews can make silly mistakes they may also make corrections. The main question here, however, is whether they have a legitimate role in suggesting or imposing revisions or "improvements." 26 Robert Taylor, quoting Max Beerbohm, refers to the latter when he describes the desire of book collectors to own first editions of works by authors they admire because "they give one a sense of nearness to him . . . 'this is the binding he chose—perhaps. This—perhaps —is the fount of type that he insisted on. Here certainly is a typographical error that his eye overlooked—bless his noble spirit!'" ( The Common Habitation Princeton, n.d., n.p.). That is to say, the document has integrity or authority as historical relic or icon, not because of the purity or inerrancy of its text. 27 I have seen this argument most frequently in the writings of Donald Pizer, but I have not seen him consider the decades and centuries of readers yet to come who, perhaps, should not be forced to read mangled texts because a few decades or centuries of readers already have. 28 It seems to me, at least on the surface, that a lot of the appeal of these arguments derives from their high-falutin vocabulary and the quasi-philosophical high ground they assume. In fact they do not address matters that have been unknown to editors in the past, though it may be true that their importance has been misjudged. 29 University of Miami of Ohio, March, 1987. 30 Michael Hancher, "Three Kinds of Intention," Modern Language Notes , 87 (1972), 827-851. By "programmatic" intentions Hancher refers to the intention to have certain effects on readers, to cause them to react; by "active" intentions Hancher refers to the author's intention to mean certain things, to convey certain understandings, feelings or actions. Thus Dreiser's active intention to delineate certain sexual experiences may have been interfered with by an editor's programmatic intention not to offend. 31 Critique , pp. 102-109. 32 "Meaning" may be the wrong word to use here. "Implication" may more accurately indicate the significance of design and price which is at least part of what is referenced by this argument. The social, political, and economic implications of being published by a certain publisher or in a certain series, or in a recognizable format, condition the reaction to the linguistic text for those persons able to recognize these implications. 33 Jerome McGann, "Theory of Texts," London Review of Books (forthcoming, 1988, [Professor McGann kindly sent a copy of proofs for this review; the remarks on Don Juan are on the third page]). I do not know by what means McGann has determined that the difference was actually caused by the physical appearance of the books and not by the moral character of the reviewers. If a single reviewer reacted differently to both editions, the case would be strong. If contemporary readers of Henry Esmond in old-fashioned Caslon type in three volumes read the book differently from those reading it in "modern" type in one volume, there is no record of it, though there were reviewers of both formats who found it immoral and others who found it a thoroughly good book. 34 N. N. Feltes, Modes of Production of Victorian Novels (1986), pp. 24 and 32. 35 There is not room here to go into a detailed analysis of the social forces operating on the composition and production of Esmond , but I am providing that discussion in a book, Pegasus in Harness: Thackeray and His Publishers which is nearing completion. In that analysis I argue that Thackeray, operating within the confines of these forces, produces an anti-establishment work—a wolf in sheep's clothing and that the "determining" forces of the social contract are not more restricting to authorial intention and individual meaning than the "determining" forces of genre are, for example, to the poet who "frets not in the narrow cell" of the sonnet. 36 Nineteenth Century English Books (1952), pp. 3-24. Ray notes, for example, the reception of Zola's works being reflected in the succession of physical formats in which they became available—from colorful, lurid paper covers to a "respectable" collected edition. 37 "Theory of Texts," London Review of Books (forthcoming, 1988). 38 "Theory of Texts." 39 Modes of Production , pp. 3 and 13. 40 It is usually not the case that a text once available publicly is changed non-authorially in subsequent texts in ways that substantially change its meaning, such that a restoration of the originally published form would confuse a reader who expected the text to correspond to received interpretations. But two famous cases of restoring unpublished manuscript versions, Crane's Red Badge of Courage and Dreiser's Sister Carrie , have stirred considerable controversy and prompt this question. 41 Works such as Look Homeward, Angel by Thomas Wolfe (and Maxwell Perkins) and The Wasteland by T. S. Eliot (and Ezra Pound) come to mind. 42 Fredson Bowers, in his Presidential address to the Society for Textual Scholarship (NYC, April, 1987) discussed at some length the question of authority, but did so from the point of view of a definition he wanted everyone to apply to that word. "We shall not get very far in examining any textual proposition," he said, "unless we can come to some understanding on what is meant by authority ." And then, "The moment that some agent like a typist, compositor, or copyreader interposes himself between the holograph and the disseminated document, the print, a diminution of authority occurs." Given his definition of authority, that is true; the issue now, however, is whether that definition should be the standard. (Quotations from Bowers' typescript, by permission.) 43 See G.

      <field name="heading_text">Regularization and Normalization in Modern Critical Texts by Fredson Bowers *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A critical text differs from a diplomatic reprint, or the modification that historians call a documentary edition, in that the editor in various specified and usually recorded details has altered his chosen copy-text in order to correct error; to impose some degree of conformity by reducing inconsistency of spelling, punctuation, and other accidentals; or to insert authorial revisions from another document. 1 Such alteration is of course emendation, for strictly speaking any change that an editor makes in his copy-text comes under the head of emendation. But some emendations are more equal than others. Obviously those that concentrate on the words, the substantives, of a text are of prime importance, and the success with which an emending editor deals with these is usually taken as the ultimate test of his expertise. His treatment of the accidentals—the texture clothing these substantives—so long as it does not attract attention by eccentricity is largely taken for granted and is seldom given notice in a review. The difference in specialized attention allocated by many editors of modern texts to the reconstruction of authoritative substantives as against the accidentals can be accounted for by reference to the history of editing. For earlier literature there exists a clear line of demarcation between modernized editions and what are known as old-spelling texts. Yet whether modernized or unmodernized, the critically adjusted substantives of either genre should be identical; thus the distinction lies in whether the editor has preserved unmodernized the older forms of spelling in all their irregularity, erratic capitalization, and early rhetorical system of punctuation, or whether all accidentals have been modified to agree with presentday usage. When an old-spelling edition is planned, an editor is forced by the nature of his copy-text to pay scrupulous attention to the critical treatment of these accidentals on a par with the substantives. For nineteenth- and twentieth-century writing the question of modernized versus unmodernized accidentals is not one of such practical import as to require two different types of edition, as is necessary with Shakespeare for example. Spelling has become largely codified although with some trans-Atlantic variation, the so-called emphasis capitals of the eighteenth century and earlier have almost wholly dissolved into concepts, a generally recognized syntactical system has replaced the older rhetorical punctuation, even though different varieties may be seen in its progress such as heavy or light, parenthetical or fluid, formalized or informal and flexible. And if some aspects of this punctuation, spelling, and other accidentals are not entirely current in our year of 1989, yet a presentday reader has little or no difficulty in adjusting to what is a perfectly intelligible system for the transmission of meaning even though its surface may appear to be slightly quaint. In these circumstances once the copy-text has been selected the editors of modern writers have been inclined to neglect the accidentals except for the correction of misprints and other positive manifestations of error. This benign neglect, with its acceptance of the view that editorial attention has been satisfied in these matters by a relatively faithful reproduction of the copy-text, means that in effect an editor is applying a double standard: critical analysis of the substantives but diplomatic reprinting of the accidentals. Yet depending upon the textual situation—as whether an editor is faced with a single authority or with multiple authoritative documents—at least as many opportunities (if not more) are likely to exist for critical treatment of the accidentals texture as are found among the substantive building blocks. Thus despite the lesser claim that accidentals may have on the transmission of absolute meaning, 2 their full inclusion in the process of critical editing is as important to the authenticity, the "definitiveness," of the text of an edition as is any other factor. 3 My overall concern is with the recovery of authorial accidentals within transmitted documents in whatever detail is possible and their controlled restoration in the copy-text as replacements for non-authorial forms produced in the process of transmission. I hope to be concerned with a few principles that evolve from the need to deal with the evidence, and their possible application, moving from an originally conservative position to what I suppose we must call a liberal extension. For my present narrow purpose I dismiss from consideration the various editorial problems both of copy-text and its treatment that arise when an authorial manuscript and its printed result compete for general as well as specific authority. Instead I propose to deal at the start only with what can be done to reconcile variant accidentals within the same text, one form of which would seem to represent the author and the other the compositor or, later, the copyreader. The purpose of this critical attention is to achieve an authoritative uniformity in certain details of the texture, a smoothing-out of non-authorial inconsistencies that are usually not positive error but are instead simple transmissional irregularities. 4 Why should an editor trouble himself with the copy-text's variant accidentals when positive error is not in question? One answer concerns editorial integrity. It is accepting the double standard if an editor does not engage himself to recover whatever authority he can from the available evidence in the accidentals with as much care as he devotes to the substantives. Another answer concerns the effect of irregularity on the reader. I suggest that an important distinction between a diplomatic reprint of a document and a critical edition even of that one document can be the difference between the reader's apprehension of raw material and his apprehension of an intelligently and purposefully shaped text that in distinctive characteristics reflects as much as possible the author and not the publisher's intermediaries. The one is chiefly for specialized reference; the other is chiefly for reading and general information as well as pleasure. A scholarly text is no less scholarly if it takes as its ideal the form of a reading edition that appeals as much as it legitimately can to a user's sense of pleasure as well as profit. The days are long since gone when it is practicable for a publisher to issue an edition that is designed only for the professional scholar (medieval literature necessarily excepted) and does not seek among its purchasers the general literate reader with an interest in the work being printed, including collegiate students at an early stage in their training. I conceive that a reading text must attempt the delicate balancing act of simultaneously appealing to both audiences without loss of scholarship but also without arbitrary and sometimes pedantic barriers to general intelligent appreciation. 5 That this compromise is both desirable and practicable may be illustrated by the growing tendency of publishers to issue a critical scholarly edition with all its accompanying apparatus, and then to abstract the text alone, by offset, for a general audience. The Harvard University Press has done this with William James's Pragmatism and his Principles of Psychology and proposes a paperback of Varieties of Religious Experience . With some modifications, the Library of America has also adopted this formula (except for one or two in-house editorial misjudgments), with acclaim from reviewers and one hopes from purchasers. It is important that a reader trust the text he is using, that he should feel a symbiotic relationship with its editor. In this matter scholars of course emphasize accuracy of transcription and the full record in apparatus of departures from the copy-text so that editorial intervention can be checked and analyzed. The nearer the text approaches the methods of diplomatic transcription, the more a scholar is prepared by his training to accept the faithful reproduction of the warts usually found in documents that are close to their original source. On the contrary, the nearer a text approaches the methods of a reading edition, the more it contrives to make uniform certain accidentals features that in their irregularity may create some unease in a user who is unaccustomed to accept without momentary interruption of concentration what are surface inconsistencies in the text. If in the fringes of his consciousness a reader is even slightly distracted by wondering whether he is faced with a misprint or whether there is a hidden significance he has missed in various anomalies—and whether these are authorial or transmissional—then the interruption of unselfconscious absorption diminishes his confidence, and certainly his pleasure, and may affect his future use of such texts. I agree that a reading edition need not and should not require the rigorous mechanical smoothing-out that the usual professional copyreader is likely to apply to a commercial manuscript about to be sent to the printer. But a critical editor can learn a lesson from those intelligent, though rare, examples of copy-editing—in Britain often by persons who may themselves be writers—which attempt to make the presentation uniform in terms of the particular author and his idiom and idiosyncrasies of style with a minimum of housestyling. Sympathetic assistance of this kind (sometimes found in The New Yorker magazine) does not impose an alien texture on a writer's work. But neither does it allow potentially troublesome variance in the accidentals that is not part of the authorial design. A critical editor as enlightened copyreader is not an immediately appealing concept, but within rational (meaning flexible) bounds it is not only true but even desirable. The two means by which a critical editor creates some order from anomalous irregularities I label regularization and normalization . I apologize for the jargonistic flavor of these terms but can think of no better ones. I construe regularization as the bringing of inconsistent elements in a text into conformity by the adjustment of variants to some one regular form already present and assumed to be authorial. Normalization I conceive as imposing an external standard of regularity without the evidence of some specific precedent in the text being edited, but one that is guided by evidence derived from similar authorial documents. Insofar as by definition nothing in a text (except perhaps analogy) encourages normalization by offering a precedent as does regularization, normalization is usually less required for readability in modern writing than in older literature, and as a consequence it is to be used with greater caution. 6 Publishers' housestyle, the imposition of which copyreaders are paid for, is normalization with a vengeance and has no place in critical editing, of course. (In an edition of older literature it would be called modernization.) Variant spelling and word-division bulk large among the inconsistencies one may find in uncopyread texts, especially those of the turn of the century. The origin of such variation is usually compositorial even though authors were not always themselves consistent. 7 Especially after Webster developments were in progress in which certain spellings characteristic of the United States broke off from the older-fashioned ways derived ultimately from Samuel Johnson's Dictionary through British models. Words such as honour or colour with the - our ending were being changed to the alternate spelling with - or . The x -spelling in connexion was giving place to connection , and the e -spelling in develope and developement or in judgment was being dropped. Words like towards and forwards were becoming toward , forward , and the like. I am no historian and so cannot date the popularization of these changed conventions, but I am conscious of a growing irregular transition in the United States from one system to another as the nineteenth century wears on and the twentieth comes into being. Although progressive printers adopted the newer forms earlier than many authors, not all of the compositors were in agreement or were able to make their styling uniform. Moreover, the influence of copy and thence of an author's older-fashioned spelling and word-division habits might occasionally tilt a compositor toward a variant spelling or division he would not consciously, let us say, have set. I suggest that within a literary unit there is no reason for a critical reading text to perpetuate transmissional variant spelling and word-division systems, and every reason not to trouble a reader by requiring him to adjust and then re-adjust his sensibility to variance between what he becomes accustomed to in a particular text and what is at odds when this variance has no point and is generally unauthoritative. Given a choice between two spellings or word-divisions in a unit it seems obvious that a critical editor should select as his accepted form that variant that agrees with the authorial preference whenever this can be established from his manuscripts, including letters. 8 The authorial form chosen as the basis for regularization will ordinarily be less current and more idiosyncratic than the compositorial alternative, but this uncommonness is actually an argument in favor of its adoption. 9 As remarked, it is the duty of a critical editor to do his best to preserve authorial characteristics in the accidentals of a print with as much care as he devotes to establishing the authority of the substantives. In respect to a reading edition, moreover, it is psychologically true that if a system is uniform within a text, the reader will readily adjust to less familiar though recognizable spellings and compoundings. It is inconsistency alone that is troubling. The question arises of the limits within which an editor can regularize certain inconsistent accidentals. The conservative view is that regularization can best be defended when it is confined to some unit that is complete in itself, like an article, an essay, a short story, or a self-contained book, whether of exposition or of fiction. Obviously, chapters of a unified book should not be held to represent independent units that may be variously treated: the evidence from one chapter is transferable to every other. On the other hand, if the principle of regularization be upheld rigorously, the conservative view would require that an after-the-event collection of essays or short stories be allowed different sets of accidentals characteristics from units to unit on the ground that the copy was almost certain to vary. A more liberal view would offer an editor the right to regularize, at least, throughout a collection sponsored by the author. The theory of limitation by unit is based on what documentary evidence is present to suggest the nature of the accidentals in whatever happened to be the copy underlying the print. If this is known or hypothesized to be a holograph or authorial typescript, the problem is solved. But in most circumstances an editor can reconstruct only the copy directly underneath the print. If this is, say, a lost professional typescript, the odds are minimal that all of the authorial accidentals will have been preserved. When to this distorting layer of transmission is added compositorial styling, the only documentary evidence that can be trusted for emendation back to authorial forms is variation in the print, one form of which should be compositorial but the other the reading of the copy. It is then a separate problem requiring collateral evidence to establish whether either form is or is not authorial. Except when the print reproduces marked authorial eccentricities like William James's simplified spelling or Stephen Crane's adjectival punctuation, coincidence with established authorial preferences may be only fortuitous even though the most plausible assumption is that they have been directly transmitted. The nature of the copy therefore defines and limits the nature of the unit. Units set from different copy are likely to exhibit different inconsistencies, the evidence of which, in such circumstances, cannot usually be transferred from one unit to another except by the different process of normalization. When regularization is strictly reserved for units, some may be so uniform that regularization is impossible in the absence of the variation that permits choice from among internal precedents. (In such cases whether normalization or extended regularization is appropriate is a separate problem to be considered later in connection with The Scarlet Letter .) A not untypical example of a smallish unit where the internal uniformity offers only limited opportunity to regularize a word according to its authoritative form is William James's "Human Immortality" (the copy almost certainly holograph), which was printed as a pamphlet in 1893 by Houghton Mifflin (edited in Essays in Religion and Morality , 1982). 10 We know from manuscripts that James almost invariably did not divide words like some one and any one but here they appear divided, and since nowhere in this essay are they undivided as evidence of the forms in the printer's copy, an editor who rejects normalization must accept them as printed. Similarly this essay contains non-Jamesian forms such as naïvely with a dieresis that James never used, connection where he preferred connexion , and fullness where he usually wrote fulness . But none of these are variant, and hence a strict editor would leave them untouched. We may be thankful that the printer did not filter out James's characteristic whilst , farther , develope , and especially his lowercase christian , an idiosyncratic treatment of certain capitals. We may be thankful, also, for the single opportunity offered by a compositorial slip. Although the printer twice set preëxist with a non-Jamesian dieresis, in the same footnote (89, fn.5) comes the true Jamesian form with a hyphen, preexists , which gives a regularizing editor his evidence on which to alter the two forms with dieresis. 11 Another opportunity to emend the uncharacteristic dieresis comes in James's "The Sense of Dizziness in Deaf Mutes" ( Essays in Psychology , 1983). Here at 138.4 the journal printed the conventional coördination , which James must have missed in proof since within a few lines we find three times (158.10, 18, 21) his characteristic co-ordination with a hyphen. Similarly, in Principles of Psychology (edited 1981) the various times in which revery appears with a y , as in James's manuscripts, permits an editor to regularize the variant reverie (548.6) to the spelling revery which in fact comes only a page later (549.11). One of James's quirks was his custom, remarked on by his brother Henry, of reducing to lower case the normal capital in adjectives derived from proper names, his practice also in the corresponding nouns though less frequently. This eccentricity was, of course, subject to housestyling almost completely, but every once in a while the copy form will slip through and on its evidence one can regularize. For instance, in Lecture I of Pragmatism (edited 1975) we find Darwinism with a capital (16.22) passed on to the book from its copy in the Popular Science Monthly ; but an editor should emend to James's characteristic darwinism after this form is observed in Lecture II (39.27) in the same transmission. One does not need the extra confidence to make the emendation, but it is useful to observe that in this book James thought enough of preserving his practice to alter magazine Hegelian to hegelian either in copy or proof in the same Lecture I (16.15), and so with euclidean and aristotelian in Lecture VI (107.6). Interestingly, in Lecture VII, set from manuscript, James inadvertently wrote Latin with a capital, but (surely in proof) it appears in the book as lower-case latin (116.6) and in lower case both in manuscript and book a few lines later (116.10). These are just a few examples from single-text regularization in which the evidence is self-contained and internal. Something of a halfway house between regularization and normalization comes in the fortunate instance of multiple authority when one or other text reveals the true Jamesian preferences as against housestyling in the other. The classic case exists whenever the setting manuscript for the print is preserved, although a precedent draft manuscript, and even a collection of notes, is not to be ignored. For instance, Lectures VII and VIII of Pragmatism were set in the first edition of 1907 from a preserved holograph that not only demonstrates authoritative forms for certain words but also illustrates how the book compositor(s) altered copy away from James's characteristics. As examples, in these chapters the book altered manuscript everyone to every one , anyone to any one , englishman to Englishman , italian to Italian , russian to Russian , french to French , european to European , greek to Greek , naively to naïvely , cannot to can not , and criticizes to criticises , as well as a range of variants in compounded words. 12 Lecture III (in part) and all of Lectures IV and V must have existed in similar manuscripts, now lost but written at substantially the same time in series. As one would expect, the book text exhibits the same non-Jamesian forms that had been altered from the manuscript of Lectures VII and VIII. It follows that on the unitary evidence of Lectures VII and VIII, all identified Jamesian spellings and word-division forms found in the manuscript should be regularized throughout Lectures III-V set from the lost section of the same overall manuscript. But one should logically carry this principle further (or as James would correctly say, farther ). Lectures I and II were set in the book from annotated pages of essays published in the Popular Science Monthly in March and April of 1907, and Lecture VI was similarly set from an essay printed in March in the Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods . The manuscripts sent to these two periodicals would have been written in series with the manuscripts used to print the other lectures in the book and would therefore have had the same characteristic accidentals. That an extra layer of housestyling was added by pre-publication prints used later as book copy does not alter the principle that the evidence from Lectures VII and VIII is as valid for I, II, and VI as it was for Lectures IV, V, and part of III. This being so, it would be splitting hairs to assert that the part of Lecture III that was set in the 1907 book from a few annotated pages of a printed lecture in 1898 should not also be made to conform by regularization, even though no holograph manuscript for it existed in 1907 as was true for the other lectures. 13 In sum, a fair number of accidentals in the book when it serves as copytext can be regularized by starting with the demonstrable evidence of the manuscript copy for VII and VIII, then enlarged by internal variation of other forms not present in the lecture manuscripts but one of the options identifiable as Jamesian from other sources. In this manner, with every emendation supported by documentary evidence within the unit of the book, a clean texture of spelling and word-division according to Jamesian authority can be reconstructed throughout the whole of Pragmatism . Similarly, the setting manuscript for Chapters XIX and part of Chapter XX has been preserved for The Varieties of Religious Experience (edited 1985). In this area the book compositor(s) housestyled away from James's characteristics in the manuscript as follows: encrusted to incrusted , everyone to every one , anyone to any one , someone to some one , excentric to eccentric , connexion to connection , criticize to criticise , and farther to further . This evidence permits regularization in the parts of Chapter XX where the manuscript is missing of eccentric to excentric , any one to anyone , connection to connexion , and every one's to everyone's . Since there is reason to suppose that the earlier chapters of the book were set up from copy containing (at least ultimately) these same preferential forms, one can regularize the forms of the eight words throughout (with analogues) as well as what can be derived from different forms of compoundings. 14 To this extent, small as it is, a critical editor can reconstruct the authoritative original and repair these specific accidentals from the book's intrusive housestyling. If an editor chose (and why not?) this list could be extended from a draft manuscript for Lecture I in which we have the typical Jamesian whilst , centre , forever , the lower-case hegelianism and scottish , a number of spellings in z instead of s such as baptize , characterize , philosophize , and verbalizing (sufficient by analogy to remove all other s -forms in the book), 15 as well as the important distinction James made between so-called with a hyphen when used as an adjective preceding a noun as in so-called philosophy and without the hyphen when placed in such verbal phrases as logic commonly so called . Extending the list from a draft for Lecture II, we should have, with some duplication, greek , symbolize , centre , kantian , hegelian , german , christian , and anyone . Among the evidences for James's preferences that appear in a series of notes for the lecture series are colour , connexion , pre-existent , and cannot as well as more lower-case adjectives from personal names and various spellings in z . Multiple authority as a source for regularization is not confined to the evidence of manuscripts, however. When one document served in whole or in part as annotated printer's copy for another, we may have a situation in which the text being edited could be consistent in the non-Jamesian form but the other text, set from this copy, printed the known Jamesian characteristic. In reverse, if the original text has the proper form but the reprint the housestyled variant, we may put this change down to the printer away from what had been earlier set from James's copy. A better case, of course, comes when a revised text by its frequent use of preferential forms indicates that James had annotated the copy with some care to secure what he wanted. An interesting example comes in the essay "Brute and Human Intellect" (edited in Essays in Psychology , 1983) in which the word imbedded in its American spelling is invariant in the original printing in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy . James's own spelling was the older-fashioned British embedded , which we find in his Principles of Psychology irregularly mixed with imbedded . However, in his Principles Chapter XXII, "Reasoning," where the annotated "Brute and Human Intellect" served in part as copy for the book, we find that journal imbedded appears as James's known spelling embedded , almost certainly by annotation (971.8-9;974.18). Despite three cases in this same chapter where James apparently did not annotate and the Principles repeats the journal imbedded (982.14;987.15;988.36), the significant double occurrence of embedded offers the opportunity to emend the journal in reverse when the article is separately edited and from these emended readings to regularize the remaining words in places where the Principles did not utilize annotated pages from the journal. Also, the evidence here for the annotation in the copy for the Principles to secure the spelling embedded more than justifies the regularizing throughout the Principles to the embedded Jamesian spelling. In the same manner the Jamesian forms in the Principles can be used to emend (and thence to regularize) in various other journal articles used as copy such words as further to farther ("Brute" 30.17), for ever to forever ("Are We Automata?" 43.8), some one's to someone's ("The Spatial Quale 75.37), outward to outwards ("The Feeling of Effort" 96.6), paralysed to paralyzed ( ibid. , 96.8), while to whilst ("The Hidden Self" 255.38;256.17;257.4; 262.37;263.38;264.17,19,22), upward to upwards (ibid., 256.16), toward to towards ( ibid. , 259.26), nowise to no wise ( ibid. , 259.32), and reverie to revery ("What the Will Effects" 220.39). Admittedly debatable but nevertheless logical are special cases when the actual text of the Principles repeats the non-Jamesian form throughout the section where the journal article is the copy, but on evidence elsewhere within the Principles the critical editor has been enabled to regularize by emendation to restore the Jamesian forms of these particular words. In such circumstances, one may argue, the emended Principles may serve as authority to restore Jamesian forms to the separately edited underlying journal texts. Examples from Essays in Psychology would be toward to towards ("Brute and Human Intellect" 50.33), any one to anyone ( ibid. , 31.29, and "Are We Automata?" 40.5, and "The Feeling of Effort" 87.32;93.23), fore finger to forefinger ( ibid. , 96.4), some one to someone ( ibid. , 105.2), every one to everyone ("On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology," 155.11) and some one's to someone's ( ibid. , 156.13). A more speculative but still logical procedure would be to group in a collection of essays, or the like, those pieces that had appeared in the same journal or magazine and to emend non-Jamesian forms by reference to the occurrence of their Jamesian counterparts in different articles but from the same journal and therefore subjected to the same housestyling. If this were done, one would then emend as partial regularization the imbedded spelling in "The Spatial Quale" (65.2) by reference to the two embedded spellings in "Brute and Human Intellect" regularized from imbedded on the authority of the alteration to embedded when this section was reprinted in the Principles . Or if this example seems too remotely authorized, one could, say, take a stray towards or anyone that had slipped through in some one journal article and regularize these particular words throughout other articles printed in the same journal. It could be argued that there is documentary authority, even though at one remove, for such changes and that they may thus be regarded as regularizations (not normalizations) on the ground that the journal would then be the unit and not the individual essay. An analogy would be an authorial collection of previously unpublished works which, being set from manuscript, could be viewed as a single-unit book and therefore subject to regularization throughout. As the examples of Pragmatism and The Varieties of Religious Experience illustrate, the preservation of the manuscript for even one of such essays would be highly useful and would add to the number of regularizing forms that could be extended to the others. But these two books also provide examples of variants from internal evidence elsewhere than in the manuscript sections that an editor was able to take advantage of in the process of regularization; hence in a collection of the kind envisaged some precedents would be found to serve as the basis for limited regularization even though no manuscripts were known. 16 The authority of a holograph manuscript is of course greater for accidentals than that of a print. But holographs are not necessarily uniform in all respects of accidentals, and their inconsistencies while authoritative in a technical sense should be subject in a critical edition (not a diplomatic reprint) using a manuscript as copy-text to the same process of regularization suitable for a print. In such manuscript variants needing regularization the number of precedents is useful for determining the norm to which variants of any word should be made to conform; but in case of doubt, and especially when numbers are ambiguous, an editor needs to assure himself that his selection agrees with the authorial preference in similar but not identical forms. When evidence in the copy-text is still insufficient for certainty, the forms in other manuscripts of roughly similar date will need to be consulted. Simple regularization may be illustrated by an example from Nathaniel Hawthorne's Blithedale Romance . At 148.32 the setting-copy manuscript reads buttonwood tree without the hyphen supplied in the first edition. Authority in the print as against the manuscript could result only from authorial proofreading, the likelihood of which in this case is minimal. Fortunately, buttonwood-tree with a hyphen comes in the next paragraph of the manuscript (149.6) and again in the next (149.29). In the same paragraph as the unhyphenated word comes hyphenated apple-trees (148.15), peach-trees (148.16), and shortly fruit-trees (149.29) and pine-trees (156.20). This accumulation of evidence that Hawthorne strongly preferred to hyphenate the names of trees can also be applied as the decisive factor in The House of the Seven Gables as between the manuscript's unhyphenated pear tree (88.2) and its precedent pear-trees (87.3), aided of course by hyphenated damson-trees in the same sentence. Likewise, current bushes in Seven Gables (153.9) can be regularized to the hyphenated word not only on the evidence of current-bushes earlier (87.4) but on such analogues as hyphenated grape-vine . Analogy again is useful when the only precedent for ambiguous manuscript white pine-tree in the Romance (208.11) is the same hyphenation earlier (98.4). The book corrects both to white-pine tree and an editor should do the same, recognizing how the force of Hawthorne's preference for hyphenating tree names led him into a situation from which he should be extricated. Numbers are of little use in Seven Gables where in the manuscript unhyphenated Pyncheon house occurring four times (153.28;173.3;184.11;192.5) is surrounded by the hyphenated form five times (5.6;6.5-6;28.28;38.26;182.25). Thus it is helpful that we have hyphenated Pyncheon-street , Pyncheon-elm , and Pyncheon-garden . By good analogy, the single unhyphenated Pyncheon bull (231.2-3) can be normalized to Pyncheon-bull . Hawthorne's Marble Faun poses some difficult problems in regularization in the spelling, owing to his attempt in the copy-text manuscript to assist the British printer who set the book by spelling certain words in what he took to be the English form instead of in his native American style. Unfortunately, his intentions were better than his practice, for his ordinary usage often peeps through the self-imposed alien system. The problem for a critical editor is which system he should choose as the basis for his regularization. At first sight it might seem that one could flip a coin. Convenience and presentday readability suggest the reversion to Hawthorne's normal American preferences. On the other hand, authorial intention (even though imperfectly carried out) suggests regularizing what are clearly his lapses and adopting on a regular basis the system he was trying to achieve. 17 For better or worse that was the decision of the textual editor of the Centenary edition. Thus the -our spellings of such variants as colour-color , favoured-favored , honour-honor , endeavour-endeavor , and even terrour-terror , errour-error , and inferiour-inferior (rejected by the printer) were regularized according to Hawthorne's intention. 18 In this manuscript Hawthorne's spelling of some words was in transition, so that (the anglicizing aside) his own preferences wavered between the older-fashioned and the more modern forms that mix in this document, as in canvass-canvas where regularization seemed desirable to canvas as the spelling that he was beginning to adopt. Also in The Marble Faun Hawthorne used as part of his normal practice the doublet subtle-subtile interchangeably; but since no trend could be discovered (as in canvas ) regularization was not attempted (see Textual Note to 45.13). Hawthorne wrote Signor and a few Signore without regard for their distinction in Italian. Since he was not writing in Italian, regularization to conventional Signor seemed more logical than an attempt to correct him. In the absence of a manuscript, Hawthorne's early Fanshawe (edited with Blithedale Romance , Centenary 1968) with its numerous inconsistencies of accidentals poses an odd problem in determining the base for regularization, a problem requiring bibliographical analysis to solve. Nine spelling, capitalization, and punctuation variants, with a few extra minor matters, break down to definite pages assignable to five different compositors: endings in -our or -or , the spelling gray-grey , the doublets Doctor-doctor , Widow-widow , Dame-dame , Master-master , Inn-inn , Heaven-heaven , and the presence or absence of quotation marks about the epigraphs for each chapter, plus a punctuation formality or so. In addition, the use or non-use of dashes at the end of sentences of narrative prose to justify the lines at the right margin was valuable as well as the variable placement of a final quotation mark in relation to other punctuation. Without manuscripts there might have been problems with the spellings, but external evidence readily provided the information to regularize them. With an editor's knowledge of Hawthorne's strong preference for hyphenating tree names, it needed only the single appearance of hyphenated elm-tree in order to hyphenate elm , birch , and oak elsewhere with confidence. A clue to the capitalization of Inn as authorial was contained in the printer's error the Sun set by Compositor C, corrected to an Inn in the errata list. It seems evident that C misread Inn as Sun , and that only an ill-formed capital I could have been mistaken for a capital S. Capitalized Doctor was authenticated as the manuscript form since of the five workmen only Compositor D used lower case. Three of the five workmen set capitalized Widow . A number of accidentals variants yielded to authority by linking the evidence of compositorial preferences with the forms in Hawthorne's manuscripts. Thus in the end internal evidence authenticated by external produced a relatively uniform and authoritative texture that replaced the mishmash that would have come from a social-contract faithful reprint of the first edition. 19 The regularization of punctuation is perhaps the most difficult and least successful, the more especially because authors themselves are not likely to be consistent. For example, William James often employed the English system of omitting a comma before the and in a series of three or more, but his manuscripts have it often enough to make an attempt so dangerous to regularize that any copy-text diversity must be preserved. Stephen Crane deliberately avoided separating by commas adjectives in a series before a noun with enough frequency that it can be marked down as a definite idiosyncrasy that must be preserved; on the other hand, his manuscripts do sometimes contain the conventional commas so that any attempt to remove all such commas in prints would be speculative normalization not to be ventured. The only exception would be if in a series of three such adjectives he wrote a comma after the first or the second but either carelessly did not insert the other, or else the comma itself was carelessly inserted by the printer. Regularization here, according to the main custom in the copy-text, would seem to be permissible. In general, regularization of punctuation can deal with some authority only in the more formal features of punctuation that are most subject to compositorial styling. One example would be the compositorial custom of putting a dash after James's colon introducing an inset quotation. But in some years James himself wrote-in such a dash, rather at random; thus regularization when precedents are available within a printed unit is possible but may in a few instances be unauthoritative. Nevertheless, when the opportunity comes, with James the effort is worth while, and when a manuscript is the copy-text regularization to remove compositorial dashes will usually have the benefit of numbers. Another styling is generally resolved with ease. During the time that the present American system of placing punctuation in relation to quotation marks was slowly coming into being, old-fashioned compositors would set a semicolon ending a quotation inside instead of outside the quotation mark. For instance, Compositor A of Fanshawe twice set the closing quotation mark inside the semicolon, the only two occurrences in the book. Some authors agreed, but most seemed to have used something like the present system though with such carelessness that they were as likely to place punctuation outside as inside quotation marks and often in their manuscripts the mark is directly above the punctuation, leaving it up to the compositor to straighten out according to the accepted styling that had actually been intended. In such circumstances it may seem best to impose the modern system on the prints of American authors after the eighteenth century whether or not a manuscript is the copy-text. Hawthorne illustrates another problem of placement. In his manuscripts he regularly puts a comma before an opening parenthesis and another comma before the closing. The compositors of The Scarlet Letter agreed, so that we read at 65.30-32, for example, 'But he opposes to me, (with a young man's oversoftness, albeit wise beyond his years,) that it were wronging the very nature of woman', just as the lost manuscript must have had it. The compositors of another printinghouse who set up the Seven Gables from a manuscript with similar characteristics ignored the manuscript and regularly placed the comma after the closing parenthesis. In Fanshawe compositorial inconsistency in this matter offered the opportunity to regularize according to the occasional occurrence of Hawthorne's own preference. Similar to this problem is the varying use of commas before the parenthetical use of dashes. William James, as one example, usually set off parenthetical matter by simple dashes although the compositors of his works almost invariably added the conventional commas of the time even if irregularly. Moreover, compositors were likely to insert a comma before a single dash that was not internally parenthetical but that marked a syntactical break at the end of a sentence. It is a moot point how far an editor should go in regularizing this comma-dash convention. If an author's manuscripts show that he is invariable in one or other system, any precedent in the print (no manuscript being preserved) may be used as the evidence for regularizing. These commas are often found when they have no syntactical purpose, that is, when the matter between the dashes being removed no comma would be natural or, at least, required. Thus any editorial attempt to regularize according to the interpretation of the syntax is almost sure to end in failure. When an author seems to have no marked preferences, it would be conservatively wisest to follow the vagaries of the print (and more certainly of a manuscript copytext) unless an editor is prepared to act as copyreader in this respect. But an author without any preference must be rare. If like William James a writer at some period develops a preference but occasionally slips, even a manuscript copy-text could be regularized with some confidence. Given a printed copytext, and an intimate acquaintance with the author, regularization will probably reconstruct the lost manuscript more often than it sophisticates it. With Hawthorne the problem slightly clarifies. Hawthorne habitually wrote parenthetical dashes without commas: in the whole Marble Faun manuscript I doubt there are more than one or two such commas. 20 Under these circumstances it was probably timid in the Centenary Scarlet Letter to reproduce the compositors' variable mixture of commas versus no commas accompanying dashes. 21 If it had been possible to break down the compositorial shares in this book with any exactitude and so to identify the true characteristics of each workman, regularization would have had a firmer basis. Nonetheless, it should have been done, anyway, for Hawthorne's preference was clear from his manuscripts intended for publication and the book text followed this preference often enough to indicate that sentences with the comma-dash combination were compositorially styled. 22 Doubtless editors will discover other formal features of punctuation that can legitimately be regularized on sufficient evidence. Unfortunately, ordinary syntactical punctuation in discourse is subject to so much inconsistent authorial variation that no writer can be regularized by second-guessing the probabilities that he would punctuate a particular passage in any precisely recoverable manner. Marked idiosyncrasies can be utilized from time to time, of course, although with caution, as for instance in Crane's inclination not to punctuate an adjectival series before a noun. But it would be a bold editor who would regularize by removing conventional commas without evidence from an underlying manuscript of some sort. I conclude with an illustration that may be of interest as dealing with a problem set by dialect in narrative. Readers of Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage when edited from the book-text must have been puzzled ever since the first edition by patches of singular incongruity in the speech of the tall soldier (Conklin), the loud soldier (Wilson), and even the protagonist youth. In Chapter I Conklin speaks in a heavy dialect (3.18-20). He is answered by Wilson in correct English (3.28-4.2). Conklin responds (4.19-23) in dialect to the questions of other dialect-speaking common soldiers, but when he next appears his dialect has been dropped and he speaks good English (10.26-29), this correct normal speech continuing through Chapters II and III. On the other hand, following Conklin's first non-dialect speech he is answered by Wilson who has shifted to dialect (10.31-32), but shortly (12.04) Wilson returns to correct speech, which is continued in Chapter II and again in Chapter III (18.25 et seq. ; 21.19 et. seq. ). When he next appears, in Chapter XIII (75.24), Wilson speaks dialect, which is then invariable to the end of the novel. Similarly, after Chapter III Conklin, who had continued correct speech in Chapter III (21.26-28.34), returns to dialect in Chapter IX (55.7 et seq. ) until his death (58.5). The youth has spoken ordinary English in Chapters I-III, but beginning with Chapter IX he has patches of dialect, as in his speech to Conklin at 57.9 although normal speech resumes in the next line (57.10). In Chapter XIII the youth incongruously shifts to dialect in his dialogue with Wilson (75.31-76.5;76.18) and so continues to the end of the chapter (79.24-29) but with one interlude of normal speech (76.25-26). In Chapter XIV, at the start the youth's speech reverts to normal but he lapses into dialect again (83.3-6), immediately returns to normal speech (83.9-11), and then back to dialect to end the chapter (83.13; 84.8-9). Beginning with Chapter XV the youth speaks ordinary English consistently. 23 To summarize: Conklin begins with dialect in Chapter I, but toward the end of the chapter and throughout Chapters II and III his speech is normal. Dialect returns in Chapter IX. On the other hand, Wilson starts off in Chapter I with proper English, changes to dialect, and then back to English, which is then maintained in Chapters II-III, until dialect starts again in Chapter XIII. In contrast, the youth begins by speaking ordinary English in Chapters I-III but inconsistently falls into dialect in some passages in Chapters IX, XIII, and XIV. Obviously something is wrong, and a reader should be baffled why Conklin and Wilson sometimes speak like the rest of the common soldiers and sometimes like educated men. Similarly, there is no apparent reason why the youth should arbitrarily turn to dialect and then back to proper speech. By any standards this is a flaw in a matter in which consistency is important to establish, but editors without a sense of regularization have ignored the problem. Fortunately, an editor need not invent dialect for the soldiers' normal speech although by normalization he must translate the youth's uncorrected dialect into ordinary English. Examination of the manuscript used to make a lost typescript from which the first edition was typeset in 1895 24 demonstrates that the non-dialect speech of all three characters is the result of alteration that Crane started as a result of Hamlin Garland's disapproval of dialect-speaking characters. With typical carelessness Crane not only did not consistently alter all the dialect in Chapters I-III, as he intended, but also after he had decided that Conklin and Wilson should retain dialect speech he did not go back to remove the interlineations of normal speech in these chapters. Correspondingly, although he tried more successfully to revise the youth's dialect throughout the manuscript, he inadvertently skipped some passages. As a result, the typescript and then the first edition faithfully reproduced the faults of the manuscript. Crane's intentions are clear, however, and an editor should observe them. (For an account of Garland's reading the manuscript, the alterations, and the transmission to print, see "The Text: History and Analysis," in the University Press of Virginia edition, 1975, especially pp. 199-234.) Normalization, as suggested in this paper, can be defined as emendation not from documentary evidence directly bearing on the text in question such as is used for regularization but instead from the imposition of an external standard without specific precedent in the text or its associated documents. The most obvious example, which no critical editor could employ, would be the modernization of all accidentals according to the current system. Necessary normalization is applied more often by the critical edition's publisher (one hopes with the knowledge and consent of the editor) in respect to various typographical details and other mechanics of presentation. For instance, heading capitals are usually normalized in the first line of any section or chapter, headings may be set in different fonts from the original and have their periods removed. In fact, all fonts are normalized (preserving of course emphasis italic or words set all in capitals). The fonts of punctuation are normalized, especially punctuation in relation to italic. It is convenient to set all punctuation in italic within italic passages. On the other hand, careless printers (and authors) may italicize punctuation after any italic word(s) immediately followed by roman text. The only proper printing practice is to set such punctuation in roman to agree with the following word. Authorial preference is not involved in these matters, and it is conventional for such alterations to be made silently. Authors are traditionally careless about or ignorant of conventions applied to ellipsis dots. Some authors may string five or six of these dots when three or four would be correct; silent normalizing to the conventional three or four again involves no authorial preferences. Spacing between the dots may vary in different prints, but it is conventional to separate dots by an enor em- space also placed before and after the sequence. Printers (and authors) are also likely to be careless about a matter that has some relation to meaning. If occurring in mid-sentence ellipsis to be indicated by dots is normalized to three. If the ellipsis ends a sentence and the next text begins a sentence, the first of the four dots should be placed closeup to correspond to the period that it is. The following three dots then follow, perhaps after a double space as an option. If instead the ellipsis begins in mid-sentence and the resumed text starts with a capitalized new sentence, then the four dots are evenly spaced, the first and last treated in the same manner as three mid-sentence dots, except that the fourth in this case is the period that ends the elided sentence. Whether a dash should be printed closeup both fore and aft or else spaced is a typographical convention that varies without significance. It would seem easiest to normalize in the modern manner to closeup. An editor needs to mark his copy for the printer in these respects at the minimum and to observe the proofs carefully lest he in turn be the victim of housestyling where it is unwanted. This is particularly true for the font of quotation marks and of question and exclamation marks, italic or roman. Some odds and ends of normalization may trend toward regularization. Correction of misspellings, for instance, could be called either, as could the linking of the digraph ae or oe in classical words. If the copy-text is consistent, the indication in German of umlauted ü by ue , for example, is worth preserving, but otherwise the umlauted form may be the basis for regularization. Idiosyncratic spellings ought to be preserved so long as they are not positive misspellings. Authors like William James who may at some period use various assorted simplified spellings ought not to be normalized; whether regularization is indicated may be determined by the document being edited. However, if tho or tho' are frequent enough to be regularized, normalization to the more correct tho' with an apostrophe should not interfere with authorial preference for simple tho . Among the odds and ends one must mention the convention of spacing contractions like did n't or didn't . This can be partly an authorial preference and partly compositorial styling. My own view is that it is simplest to regularize or if necessary to normalize to the modern forms. This treatment may seem ruthless and insensitive to historicity, but it will save problems of consistency, such as whether did n't is consistent but doesn't equally so in the same unit. Almost certainly analogous forms will vary in their treatment in a copy-text, authors might space some contractions but not others, and in short it could be a mess. If it is not a mess, then an editor might well preserve this convention. Otherwise, a note in the textual introduction could take care of the matter. Hyphenated words broken at the end of a line in the copy-text need regularization or normalization, depending upon the circumstances, when transcribed, and an editor should be careful to clarify the status of hyphenated words after the printer has set his own edited text. William James was often sketchy in the forms of his footnotes, abbreviating titles at will, providing cited authors with initials, or full names, or surnames only, not always indicating the date and especially the particular edition used for citations, and at various times incomplete in the notation of pages cited. Normalization here is particularly of service to a reader, the editor identifying the exact edition quoted from and providing full and accurate bibliographical information, especially since James's memory sometimes betrayed him and his spelling of authors' names was not always exact. What to do about normalizing quotations has become something of a contentious matter. When a writer like James does not indicate ellip es by dots but prints continuous text, correction by dots would seem to be indicated in fairness to the author quoted. But even that may be denied by critics who believe that quotations should be handled precisely as if they were the author's own text with no editorial intervention save for misprints. As I understand it, the argument goes that changes, whether deliberate or inadvertent, are a part of the authorial complex being presented and that interference with his treatment of quotations is as serious a matter as editorial interference with his own text. In high theory I agree with this proposition but in practice I query it except in certain circumstances. For instance, a writer reading a misquotation from his works is not necessarily pleased at having his punctuation and his syntax altered, if British his spelling americanized, and even his own words sometimes replaced by others without notice so that what he reads in a quotation may not, he feels, fairly represent him to the world—which may indeed know no more of him than is represented by the quotation. I believe that it is usually possible to distinguish between inadvertent faults in transmission from original author to printed quotation and the quoter's deliberate changes. Except to show that a particular writer was a careless transcriber (or employed amanuenses who were careless) the point of reproducing a distorted version is obscure since the reader cannot know what differences exist except by consulting the record in the apparatus (which may or may not list the accidentals differences). If so, the same information is transmitted if the quotation is brought into conformity with the original and the author's inadvertent changes are, instead, the subject of the apparatus listing. Moreover, since it is as possible for the compositor to alter the accidentals of a quotation by introducing his own styling, what one reads in print is not necessarily what the author transcribed in the printer's copy. 25 This is one side of the coin. As for the other, we may note that James, who quoted extensively, was likely to speed up the quoted matter by small omissions or paraphrases that he did not trouble to indicate; occasionally he felt he could phrase a point he was making by quotation more felicitously than the original, especially in the matter of sharpening the idea he was concerned with. These are legitimate authorial differences and may be viewed as so integral a part of the argument being presented as to be retained in the text, the apparatus of course doing justice to the quoted author by noting what he had in fact written. Even when the sense has not been deliberately altered in this manner James might condense a quotation by a combination of omissions here and there, perhaps only a sentence apart, and changes to link such omissions, as well as paraphrases to speed up or get over the hump in a quotation. For an editor to sprinkle a quotation of this sort with ellipsis dots to indicate every such omission, and not just the major ones (legitimate emendations) would be to annoy a reader more than to enlighten him. The apparatus is the proper place for such disruptive notation. A critical editor may well try to strike a balance between justice to the writer quoted and to the writer quoting and treat quotations critically in a manner least confusing to the reader and as fair as possible to all parties. The principles involved are not very complex. 26 One other contentious question of normalization may be mentioned briefly since it has complex reasons for which elaboration here would prove too lengthy. Roughly, it concerns the normalization chiefly of spelling but also of a few punctuational conventions when an American author is published in England and it is advisable to choose the English print as the copytext. Stephen Crane offers a number of examples, but the following are typical. Between July 31 and August 14, 1897, Crane published eight "London Impressions" (collected in Tales, Sketches, and Reports , 1973) in the English Saturday Review and, of course, styled in the English manner. The only American version was the unauthoritative reprint that Cora collected for Last Words from the Review copy in her own typing made from the print. This situation emphasizes the problem whether an American author should be presented to a reader in a dress completely alien to his nationality and one that could not possibly represent the printer's copy. Yet no authority exists in the proper sense of the word for the re-nationalizing of his spelling, at least, and possibly other conventions. Rigorous adherents to the theory of copy-text would reprint the English version as the only authority we know. Others may agree with the editor of Crane that recorded normalization here does no harm except to surface authority, and that an American author should wear his native clothes in the matter of spelling, as indeed Crane did in the unauthoritative American edition. A more complex case comes when multiple authority is involved. Crane's "Price of the Harness" was simultaneously printed in England in Blackwood's Edinburgh Review and in the United States in the Cosmopolitan Magazine . The copy for both was a professional typescript and its carbon made up from Crane's now lost manuscript. Crane was in Havana and had no opportunity to check the typescript or to read proof. Technically, each print has equal authority, and under these conditions a critical editor may attempt to reconstruct the lost typescript (which is as far back as he can go in the line of transmission) by his selection from one or the other according as the readings reflect his acquaintance with Crane's accidentals as well as substantives, although in the matter of spelling the American Cosmopolitan was obviously the superior authority. On the other hand, a critical assessment of the text indicated that on the whole the English text was more faithful to Crane's substantives and to many of his characteristic accidentals (spelling aside) than its heavily styled American counterpart. Either copy-text, thus, needed relatively frequent emendation from the authority of the other. It was probably the tyranny of the copy-text—in a manner of speaking—that dictated the choice of the Cosmopolitan in the collection printed as Tales of War (1970) simply because it was the American publication. In fact, so much emendation was required from Blackwood's that the apparatus might have been shorter if the copy-text had been reversed and Blackwood's modified by what seemed more authoritative (including the spelling) in the Cosmopolitan . When multiple authority is involved, even though not international, as in the newspaper syndication of Crane's stories, the eclectic text that results from a critical analysis of the relative fidelity of the various equal authorities to what is established as Crane's general system of accidentals—with due regard for the nature of the basic copy from which the authorities derive—this pure reconstruction of the lost copy might be called regularization or normalization according to one's point of view. Whatever it is, it may seem to represent some sort of sophisticated blend of the two, and in such special circumstances definition is of no major importance. However, one must recognize the much more common circumstance of multiple authority where both manuscript and its print are preserved, and a combination of regularization and normalization seems to be required to sift the evidence for imperfection and inconsistency in the manuscript accidentals needing attention as set against the attempt to separate the authority of the writer's proofreading alterations from the unauthoritative printinghouse or copyreader's styling as represented in the accidentals of the print. This is to assume the simplest case when the preserved manuscript is the setting copy. Instead, when the manuscript or typescript is collateral or farther back in the direct line of transmission, the case for copy-text and for the treatment of the accidentals by regularization of this copy-text from other authoritative sources becomes more complex and less subject to generalization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper retains the form of public address of its abbreviated version read before the Society for Textual Scholarship in New York City on April 10, 1987. 1 Critical edition is a more comprehensive term than critical text since to the edited text it adds such important accompaniments as an analytical textual introduction and various series of apparatus. For the moment I am not concerned with these appurtenances to the text and so for convenience may use the term edition and text interchangeably when in fact I am concerned strictly with the text. However, the presence in a scholarly edition of an apparatus that records editorial alterations in depth is an essential factor behind my views of the manner in which texts may be emended. 2 In modern texts the effect on meaning of the different forms of accidentals varies considerably. It is true that spellings are an essential part of the philological historicity of a text and not just a means for imparting an agreeable flavor of the past. But compared with punctuation, capitalization, emphasis italic, and paragraphing, for example, spelling as such has little effect on the direct transmission of meaning. Punctuation as it illuminates the contextual modification of word, phrase, or clause, may sometimes be as vital to the meaning as the substantives, the words themselves; and insofar as capitalization may distinguish concepts it can be of more than casual significance. Structural paragraphing marks meaningful progression within discourse. Normally, punctuation when not setting off syntactical boundaries in the interest of clarity enables an author to direct the flow of his style as if he were reading aloud, with the pauses and emphases that he felt when writing and that he wants to transmit to the reader. It is not by chance that Nathaniel Hawthorne, for example, utilizes a heavy parenthetical punctuation whereas Stephen Crane, with an entirely different purpose, omits some of what are usually considered to be normal punctuation divisions. 3 Once an appropriate copy-text has been selected, many single-text modern works may seem to offer little need for critical attention other than the weeding-out of error. For some of these texts seeming may be true; for others it may represent only neglected opportunity. On the other hand, the frequent preservation of multiple authority in the form of drafts, completed manuscripts, typescripts, proofs, as well as variant publication, challenges a critical editor to create an eclectic text that selects the truest authorial characteristics for accidentals from among a body of documents that attest to a variety of possible non-characteristic as well as characteristic forms, not always in series and not always authoritative in the preserved documents of their transmission. A professional typescript, for instance, is less authoritative than a holograph manuscript or authorial typescript. 4 Very strictly speaking, any compositorial departure from copy is an error, a statement that would include all housestyling. But when the setting copy is not preserved, the presence of such "error" can only be inferred, sometimes with near certainty as with the appearance of an alien for an idiosyncratic authorial characteristic, often with mere suspicion, but more often with complete uncertainty whenever neutral details are involved. For our purposes, therefore, it will be convenient to enlarge error from its technical to its popular sense, that is, of something wrong, not just something altered by another hand from the original in detail that has little or no exact application to the sense. 5 For example, in recent editions of Elizabethan dramatists an attempt has been made in old-spelling editions to reach out to a more general audience by removing unessential barriers to a general reader's, or early-student's, approach. One now finds most editors substituting the short s for the old long s, modernizing from an only slightly later period the old u-v and i-j conventions, normalizing speech-prefixes, making stage-directions more consistent, and slightly adjusting the more ambiguous and potentially confusing examples of freewheeling early punctuation. Even undergraduates, I am told by an experienced teacher, seem to respond to this approach when they are properly introduced to it. The means for dealing in this manner are treated in my "Readability and Regularization in Old-Spelling Texts of Shakespeare," Huntington Library Quarterly , 50 (1987), 199-227. 6 The problem of regularization and normalization in manuscripts is usually more acute than with prints, which willy-nilly have already gone through some resolution of inconsistency at the hands of compositors or copyreaders, a process only imperfectly to be isolated by an editor when a work is preserved in a single authoritative document. This is no place to expatiate on the differences between the two media in respect to the editorial problems they individually present. In fact, the principles are identical for both in the matter of regularization, and the difference consists mainly in the larger amount of attention ordinarily required for the presentation of a critical reading edition of a manuscript as copy-text in comparison with that needed for a print unless the manuscript is being treated in a diplomatic, or documentary, manner where inconsistency must be preserved as a virtue. 7 I do not know when copyreading became standard in commercial book publishing. Certainly the preserved manuscripts of books by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Stephen Crane, or William James (my chief acquaintances) show no signs of copyreading. On the other hand, the results suggest that attention was paid to styling by the editors of various magazines that published these authors, but how far this pre-print styling extended to the accidentals is uncertain. On the whole one is probably safe in earlier printing in assessing variation as mainly compositorial. Nevertheless, even when copyreading became the rule and compositors were expected strictly to follow copy, variation could result from oversight in preparing the manuscript. A copyreader may not have been letter-perfect and might miss variation or could inadvertently create variation himself by memorial lapses. Strange things could and did happen which the average author was powerless to prevent or repair, given the present custom in commercial publishing of not resubmitting copyread manuscript to the author for approval before typesetting. When my wife, Nancy Hale, came to read galleys for her biography of Mary Cassatt, published in 1975 by Doubleday, she discovered that about halfway through the typescript a second copyreader with quite different styling had replaced the original reader so that two divergent and inconsistent systems separated the halves of the book's typesetting. 8 In the event that insufficient holograph material is preserved, it is more likely that the less familiar or conventional form will be the author's and not the compositor's, and so choice can proceed on that basis. 9 One may cite William James's excentric , canvass (as a noun), or hindoo (for Hindu ). In The Marble Faun Hawthorne out-Englished the English in preparing his manuscript specifically for an English publisher, especially in the extension of -our endings beyond custom. The English compositors were sometimes irregular in restyling this copy to normal British usage. Moreover, the copy itself was inconsistent when Hawthorne inadvertently forgot to write according to his self-imposed system. Like the early James neccessary , true misspellings are not to be preserved, of course, no matter how characteristic provided that they are indeed genuine misspellings. But an editor is faced with Hobson's choice about Hawthorne's regular cieling since this is not a misspelling proper but an old-fashioned holdover from an occasional eighteenth-century spelling apparently affected by an earlier seeling spelling. The Centenary editor of Hawthorne was no doubt mistaken to flinch at reproducing cieling from the copy-text manuscripts and to substitute the compositorial normalization ceiling from the prints. 10 All references are to the separately titled volumes and the page-line numbers of The Works of William James (Harvard University Press, 1975-88). Hawthorne is cited from the Centenary edition (Ohio State University Press, 1968-74) and Stephen Crane from the multi-volumed Works (University Press of Virginia, 1969-75). 11 It must be regarded as a pedantic distinction mistakenly based on a too scrupulous definition of unit when the textual editor of the James edition retained preëxistent in his reprint of an added preface prefixed to the second edition, presumably on the ground that the printer's copy differed between second-edition preface and that behind the first-edition text. 12 The following manuscript compounds differ from manuscript in the print: school-room, class-room , turning-down, belly-band, straw-hats, gold-background, earthborn, offhand . 13 In fact, this statement is truer in theory than in practice since in this part of Lecture III the only non-Jamesian form for which we have evidence in VII-VIII is the book's repetition twice of any one . However, the evidence of Lecture VII is still useful in regularizing these two occurrences to anyone even though for this word the printed lecture of 1898 and a typescript made at that time from James's rough manuscript also read anyone : each is an independent witness to the lost manuscript but one cannot guarantee that each had accurately copied the form of this word (although apparently they did). 14 The following manuscript compounds differ in Chapters XIX and XX of the book: burnt-offerings , marlin-spike , beggarlike , re-awaken , and re-assert . 15 In the process of regularization, as here, it may seem legitimate to extend specific evidence to that of analogues. However, an editor must be prepared with evidence that such analogues are legitimate ones. For instance, although James spelled connexion with a x , his spelling for reflection was conventional with the ct. James invariably spelled colour but for similar words he always wrote -or . 16 It must be admitted that in a posthumous volume of editorially collected essays of different dates from manuscript (possibly mixed with printed copy) an attempt to cross-regularize might well be pushed over into the field of normalization. In such circumstances it might sometimes be better for a regularizing editor to confine his emendations to the evidence of precedents within any individual essay, thus treating each essay as a separate unit. In such a collection different accidentals systems ought to be accepted with equanimity by any reader. It must also be admitted that the examples of Pragmatism and the Varieties are not necessarily exact parallels to a hypothetical authorially collected volume of essays. In both books the sections of lectures were written in sequence and in what were essentially similar manuscripts; hence it was possible to extrapolate the evidence of the preserved part of such an overall manuscript back to the lectures set from lost manuscripts. (The only exceptions to this neat pattern are the three Pragmatism lectures set in the book from annotated journal copy, but in turn these journals were set from the same set of manuscripts and so the end is the same.) However, an author's own collection of unpublished units set from manuscript (perhaps mixed with previously printed units) would very likely derive from less consistent copy which if written over a substantial period of time might have slightly different personal characteristics, to say nothing of transmissional. One's general desire would be to regularize, but subject to special circumstances. 17 Some linguistic specialist may find it interesting to inquire into the details of Hawthorne's attempt as well as the details of the printer's rejection of various of his putatively anglicized spellings such as liquour . There is also the problem of unique or consistent spellings that would need to be normalized without the documentary evidence within the book's unit available for regularization. Analogy would need to be called on heavily. 18 An exception was made for neighbor , which was so far in the majority—with only a scattering of neighbour spellings—that it was retained. Whether this regularization on the basis of numbers was wise may be put in doubt: even the few neighbour spellings attest to Hawthorne's general intention in a case where otherwise habit proved too strong for him. It is unlikely that he felt that neighbor should be excluded from the -our spellings that he was trying to adopt. 19 The details of this investigation are elaborated in the Centenary Textual Introduction, pp. 319-329. 20 I notice at 128.14-15 that in the Faun manuscript a comma comes before the first parenthetical dash but none appears before the second. It is a commonplace in William James's manuscripts to see him interline parenthetical dashes where he had written commas in the text. But almost invariably he did not delete the commas at the time he was interlining the dashes. Whether this was simple negligence or whether he intended the comma-dash combination in these circumstances (although simple dashes are common in the same manuscript) is moot. The odds would seem to favor negligence. 21 In 1962 the textual editor of The Scarlet Letter grasped the significant point that regularization should be confined to evidence within the unit (p. xxxv), and he was prepared to alter to Hawthorne's preferences three spellings that were variant in the print. But he was not prepared to regularize punctuation except in error and felt that compositorial pointing otherwise had to be preserved faut de mieux (p. lxiv). At that time, however, the differentiation had not formed in his mind between certain formal aspects of punctuation that can be regularized to what would almost certainly have been in the manuscript as distinct from ordinary syntactical pointing so subject to authorial mood or indifference that editorial regularizing could seldom guarantee a plausible reconstruction of the manuscript in any given case. Since the evidence of the variable comma-dash in the Letter may be assigned as a general compositorial styling and Hawthorne's habitual practice without commas was known, The Scarlet Letter text might safely have been regularized in this formal feature by removing the commas. In the matter of spelling, the housestyling was consistent for certain words in -or (Hawthorne's spelling) but also consistent for others in -our (compositors' spelling). Since there was no deviation in any of these words, the lack of specific inconsistency did not seem to allow regularization: the alteration of the consistent -our forms to -or seemed to be normalization and thus highly debatable. Consequently, in 1962 the editor felt there was no choice but to follow copy, even though this meant reproducing what was demonstrably a compositorial and not an authorial divergence. I am inclined to agree that for better or worse the rules work so logically that usually they ought to be kept, within flexible limits. But the results can be illogical, as in The Scarlet Letter . Thus the temptation is strong to apply normalization to these -our spellings since we can be certain the compositors in them departed from the manuscript setting copy. Unless it is weaseling, in the end we may come down to a definition of what is meant by variation within a unit. The Centenary editor applied the definition narrowly to each individual word. But if one were to argue that in this case the general classification of compositorial -our versus authorial -or should be the basis and not specific words, then it might just possibly—and with some stretching—be considered as regularization (and not normalization) to alter the various -our words to -or on a more broadly viewed concept of what constitutes variation within a unit. Since this distinction of the two kinds of variation within regularization is highly debatable, an editor need not be faulted if he chooses one or the other: there is a logical principle behind each. I sympathize with the broader view— even if it is close to normalization—but must confess I have not experimentally worked out all of its ramifications if generally applied to other texts. Certainly the kinds of differences to be treated broadly as classes would need to be chosen with care and with the utmost regard paid to what should be the almost total invariableness of the author's usage. With suitable restrictions I rather fancy it might work. Something of a paradigm comes in James's Varieties of Religious Experience . From the manuscript for Chapters XIX and XX and the drafts for two other chapters, plus notes, we can see that the book compositors regularly changed James's -z spellings in words like criticize to the s -spelling like criticise . It would seem to be utter nonsense to restrict emending the s to z spellings throughout the book only to the words found in the partial manuscripts, leaving anomalous and inconsistent s spellings as in the book whenever there was no specific precedent. Clearly all s words must be changed to z as part of a general classification. This is surely an example that works. 22 It is no doubt a distinction without a difference to note that regularization in printed texts endeavors, on some documentary evidence of compositorial variance, to restore the hypothetical authorial reading in the lost manuscript from compositorial interference, but that regularization within a holograph manuscript—no matter how necessary—cannot restore demonstrable authority. Strictly speaking, the vagrant comma in The Marble Faun mentioned in footnote 20 above is authoritative since it comes in holograph and is the only evidence we have. Thus an emending editor cannot assert restoration of an authorial reading here in the Faun but only restoration of a firm authorial characteristic from the author's own thoughtless lapse—in this case an actual error on his part. Since the comma-dash combination is practically unknown in Hawthorne's manuscripts one might speculare that in writing out the Faun fair copy he made an incomplete alteration of what could have been parenthetical commas in the draft. 23 In Chapter XXI the youth and Wilson have one speech together jumbled without differentiation of speaker (120.37-39), all of this in dialect. But which part is the youth's and which Wilson's (if Crane himself ever differentiated them) is moot. The youth's last line in Chapter XXIV (132.17) is probably to be taken as unrevised dialect. 24 It is difficult to understand the basis for recent statements that it was Crane's editor Hitchcock and not Crane himself who deleted the endings of certain chapters scored through in the manuscript and absent from the book. (1) Most tellingly, certain of these deletions were made in the same blue pencil in which Crane in his own hand wrote some further alterations. (2) Plenty of textual evidence of coincidences in typist's errors as well as in indifferent readings between newspaper and the book against the manuscript demonstrate the same basic copy—a typescript and its carbon—was used to set both newspaper and book. (3) Hitchcock accepted the Red Badge after reading the clippings of the previously printed newspaper version that Crane brought him. (4) The newspapers—which admittedly contain a vastly cut version—do not print any of the material deleted in the manuscript. (5) All facts indicate that the deletions in question were made before the final typescript was ordered which in turn was in back of the newspaper version printed before Hitchcock came into the picture. (6) No scrap of evidence is preserved that Hitchcock ever saw the manuscript. (7) The deleted chapter endings thus were initiated solely by Crane and represent his last intention before he ordered the pre-Hitchcock final typescript and carbon. (8) Every piece of evidence indicates that the manuscript was not touched in any way after the typescript and its carbon were made from it except to abstract a few pages of a battle scene for separate magazine publication. A recent edition of the Red Badge trumpeting the reprinting of these repetitious chapter endings as the restoration of Crane's true intention from Hitchcock's requested deletion is just plain wrong. The evidence of the manuscript clearly shows that it was Crane who on his own initiative deleted them, and wisely so. 25 Comparison against the originals in quotations in James's manuscripts used as setting copy, or journal articles used as copy for books, and then against the final printed accidentals, shows that compositors had no especial respect for reproducing copy in quotations as against their treatment of regular text but that they imposed housestyling on quotations as freely as on the quoting author. 26 The problem of quotations is discussed in various volumes of the James edition, but special reference may be made to "A Note on the Editorial Method" in Essays in Psychical Research (1986), pp. 449-450. Questions of regularization and normalization are treated briefly in pp. 446-449.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Visions and Revisions: A Further Look at the Manuscripts of Julian of Norwich by Marion Glasscoe</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Showings of Julian of Norwich is one of the most remarkable texts of the Middle Ages. The personal experience of God which underlies the exposition of ways of living in Rolle, Hilton and the Cloud -author, is right at the centre of Julian's reason for writing. It was a visionary experience where visual imagery and language serve an awareness of God as a living reality and a transforming dynamic. This is manifested in Julian's own personal circumstances which encapsulate the visionary experience. In the early 1370s at the critical point of an illness which she desired in order to understand more deeply the sufferings of Christ, she felt herself dying. It was about four o'clock in the morning and a priest was called who set a crucifix before her face which, she says, was a source of light in surroundings which were dark to her. Suddenly her experience of pain was miraculously transformed to one of well-being and she had a series of visions on the nature of redemption which lasted until noon. They started with Christ crucified and ended with a visionary assurance of the metaphysical reality behind her own experience of release from sickness and pain: that ultimately she would be released from the process of suffering in time to a complete and lasting joy. She then experienced another return to and remission of her sickness before the final sixteenth showing of Christ ruling endlessly in the soul which appeared to her as having immense space—that of a kingdom. It is as if her experience in physical sickness of suffering and relief is both the initial condition for the understanding of the redemptive process and emblematic of it. Her visionary experience swings between two manifestations: that of God and sin: God as the ground of all things 'ther is no doer but he' (c.11, p. 14), 1 and sin as the ultimate in negation 'for I beleve it hath no maner of substance ne party of being, ne it myght not be knowin but by the peyne that it is cause of' (c.27, p.29). This experience, through the image of Christ's passion, illuminates for her the reality of a love which works by the means of time, suffering and failure to prove itself. 2 Her own suffering and deliverance from it stands as a witness to this process. Indeed, her sickness, which she experiences not only as physical pain but as alienation and self-doubt (c.66), is just part of a cosmological process: the firmament, the erth faledyn for sorow in hyr kynde in the tyme of Crist's deyng; for longith it kyndely to thir properte to know hym for ther God in whome al ther vertue stondyth; whan he faylid, than behovyd it nedis to them for kyndnes to faylen with hym as mech as thei myght, for sorow of his penys (c.18, p.20). But this failing process does not run its course: Julian recounts that as she contemplated the ebbing of the life-giving processes in Christ's passion: sodenly, I beholdyng in the same crosse, he chongyd his blissfull chere . . . I understode that we be now, in our lords menyng, in his crosse with hym in our peynys and our passion, deyng; and we wilfully abydyng in the same cross with his helpe and his grace into the last poynte, sodenly he shall chonge his chere to us, and we shall be with hym in hevyn (c.21, p.23). For Julian the most crucial element in her visionary experience is her identification with the reality of pain and sin (witnessed to in c.19, p. 21, where she refuses to raise her eyes from the cross and chooses 'Iesus to my hevyn, . . . in al this tyme of passion and sorow') and her growth during this experience in assurance that, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, 'al shal be wel' all shall be redeemed: "than shall non of us be stirid to sey in ony wise 'Lord, if it had ben thus, than it had bene full wele', but we shall seyn al without voice 'Lord, blissid mot thou ben! For it is thus, it is wele'" (c.85, p.101). Our understanding of this remarkable account is circumscribed by factors concerning both the history of its transmission and the present state of scholarship. An examination of the evidence provided by the extant manuscript sources points to problems in establishing a Julian text of which perhaps those who love to read her are insufficiently aware. The aim of this paper is to highlight these difficulties by presenting some conclusions which follow from further study of the nature of the extant manuscripts and an analysis of significant variant readings they provide. There exist two basic accounts of her experience, one very much more extended than the other. The shorter version is extant in a single manuscript copy, British Library Additional MS.37790(A). The fuller text is complete in three manuscripts: 1. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Fonds Anglais No. 40(P); 2. British Library Sloane MS.2499(S1); 3. British Library Sloane MS. 3705(S2). Since Julian tells us in the longer text that she had inward teaching for twenty years save three months after the original experience (c.32 p.56), and since in the chapter headings recorded in the Sloane versions that for 86 says 'the good lord shewid this booke shuld be otherwise performid than at the first writing', 3 it is generally assumed that A represents an early version of Julian's experience and that the other longer manuscripts contain an account which includes the insights and understanding accumulated over the twenty odd years she speaks of. There is no external evidence to prove that the short version is not in fact excerpts from a longer account—indeed it occurs in a manuscript where such excerpts from other works appear—but the passages in A which do not occur in the long version are of such a kind as to render it unlikely that they would have been either added to excerpts, or extrapolated from the longer text like a précis. Some of these passages are concerned with personal details—for instance that her mother was present at her sick bed (c.X, p.54) 4 or that the priest who brought the crucifix had a child with him (c.II, p.41). It is reasonable to suppose that the long version represents Julian's enlarged understanding of her original experience which she is now anxious to make more available to her fellow Christians and in which personal details are no longer necessary. The longer version is also much more confident in tone than A, for example, she leaves out her protestations about her wish to declare what she has been shown despite the fact that she is a woman (c.VI, p.48), leaving in only those experiences of weakness which are integral to the visionary experience. There are, however, differences between the manuscript copies of the longer version which raise further questions. Of the three complete versions, since S2 is simply an eighteenth-century modernisation of S1 it is not generally germane to these considerations. But between Paris and S1 there are differences which need to be taken account of. These need to be seen not only in relation to each other, but to A, where the short and long versions coincide, and also to two other early manuscript copies of excerpts from the extended version. The first of these is Westminster Treasury 4 (W), a collection of devotional pieces to promote meditation—commentaries on Psalms 90 and 91, extracts from Hilton's Scale and the pieces from Julian. It is written throughout in a very legible secretary hand of the early sixteenth century and the excerpts, which are taken from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 9th, 10th and 15th showings and Julian's understanding of them, seem chosen to illustrate the intimately close relationship between man and God both in man's very being and in the work of redemption. This relationship is a source of joy to man and God: it is accessible to man through prayer, and can be expressed and understood in terms of God as a mother who nurtures a child to maturity, which signifies for man his fulfillment in heaven. The second collection of excerpts is very short and comes from the 12th and 13th showings, chapters, 26, 27, 28, 30 and 32. They are concerned with God as the fullness of glory and with the barrier between us and this glory formed by sin which will itself ultimately be transformed through the work of redemption when 'al shal be wel' through the compassion of Christ. They occupy folios 114-117 of a seventeenth-century manuscript from the Upholland Northern Institute (formerly St Joseph's College) in Lancashire (U). Of the two earlier manuscripts of the complete account, S1 is rather messily written in an early seventeenth-century cursive hand; it contains only Julian's showings and preserves linguistic forms which are closer to Julian's own time (late fourteenth century) than those in P. It also contains chapter contents at the heading of each chapter which are not present in P; furthermore not all the chapter divisions in S1 entirely correspond with those in P. P itself also contains only Julian's text. It is deliberately calligraphic, written in a simplified bastard hand with some elements of italic style, and belongs to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. Its language is modernised—it also contains occasional passages omitted from S1 which itself contains a few passages not in P. Many of these passages in both manuscripts may be attributed to scribal carelessness but there is a residue which cannot be thus accounted for. In the main W and U follow P. U, however, is modernised and glossed in the body of the text which lessens its value as a contributor to establishing Julian's text. Interestingly, though, W occasionally agrees with S1 in preserving earlier, medieval word forms. The following section concentrates on an analysis of representative variations, whether by commission or omission, between S1 and P in order to illustrate the pitfalls in presenting a clearly conclusive case for either: (1) adopting either S1 or P as preferred copy-text for Julian's work; or (2) arguing the validity of establishing a text eclectically. At the same time a case will be made for recognising qualities peculiar to S1 which have been overlooked by those who concentrate on the rhetorical superiority of P. 5 For the sake of the reader all references for quotations from P will be to the critical edition of Julian's showings by E. Colledge and J. Walsh. 6 The readings have been compared with the manuscript to which on occasions it will be necessary to refer directly. All italicised emphasis in the presentation of specific examples is mine to clarify the issues under discussion. Since substantiation of the argument depends on the presentation of a rather dense mass of textual detail it may be helpful to outline its main stages in advance. It falls into three parts. The first will compare variants between P and S1 in those passages of the text which the short and long versions have in common so that comparison can be made with A in any attempt to determine their significance. The second will analyse different kinds of variation between P and S1 chiefly in passages peculiar to the long text. In both of these sections reference will be made to the relationship between the evidence afforded by the manuscripts and its availability to the reader in the text and annotations provided by Colledge and Walsh. The third section will concentrate on examples which develop this aspect of the investigation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I A comparison between the short and the two longer texts in passages common to both show that on the occasions where P and S1 differ from each other, one or other may agree with A. Where A and S1 agree against P it is usually in the use of an older form of a word, e.g.: A (c.I, p.40, l.20) Lorde, thowe woote whate I wolde etc. S1 (c.2, p.3) Lord, thou wotith what I would etc. P (c.2, p.288, l.36) Lord thou knowest what I would etc. or again: A (c.X, p.55, l.4) the mykillehede of hir payne etc. S1 (c.18, p.20) mekylhede of hyr payne etc. P (c.18, p.366, l.4) the grettnes of her peyne etc. Where A and P agree against S1 it is often in the coincidence of a passage omitted from S1, e.g.: A (c.XXII, p.73, l.22) He sittes in the saule euen ryght in pees &amp; reste, and he rewles &amp; ʒemez heuen &amp; erth and alle that is. The manhede with the godhede sittis in reste, and the godhede rewles and ʒemes withowtyn any instrumente or besynes; and my saule is blisfullye occupyed with the godhede that is sufferayn might , sufferayne wisdome etc. S1 (c.67, p.82) He sitteth in the soule even ryte in peace and rest. And the Godhede ruleth and gemeth hevyn and erth and all that is; sovereyn myte etc. P (c.68, p.640, l.9) He syttyth in þe soule evyn ryghte in peas and rest, and he rulyth and ʒevyth hevyn and erth and all that is. The manhode with the godhed syttyth in rest, the godhed rulyth and ʒeveth withoutyn ony instrument or besynesse. And þe soule is alle occupyed with the blessyd godhed þat is souereyne myghte etc. On the other hand there is no absolute consistency about this phenomenon: thus P sometimes adds a passage which interrupts the sequence common to S1 and A: A (c.XXI, p.72, l.20) Bot I couth telle it na preste, for I thoght, 'Howe schulde a preste leue me? I leued nought oure lorde god'. This I leued sothfastlye etc. S1 (c.66, p.81) . . . but at that tyme I cowde tell it no priest, for I thowte: 'How should a priest levyn me? I leve not our lord God'. This I levid sothfastly etc. P (c.66, p.633, l.24) But I cowlde telle it to no prest, for I thought, how shulde a preste belieue me when I by seaying I raved, I shewed my selfe nott to belyue oure lorde god? Nott withstanding I beleft hym truly etc. It is also clear that there are intermediary versions of the long text between S1 and P and the original extension of the shorter version of the showings. Thus for instance: A (c.XVII, p.65, l.22) . . . and than com verrayly to my mynde, David, Peter &amp; Paule, Thomos of Inde and the Maudelayn etc. S1 (c.38, p.39) . . . God browte merily to my minde David and other in the old law without numbre, and in the new law he browte to my mynd first Mary Magdalen, Peter and Paul, and those of Inde and Seynt Iohn of Beverley etc. P (c.38, p.446, l.13) . . . and then god brought merely to my mynde David and other in the olde lawe with hym with ouʒt nomber; and in the new lawe he brought to my mynde furst Magdaleyne, Peter and Paule, Thomas and Jude , Sent John of Beverley etc. Here it looks as if the original expansion of the short text to distinguish between the old law and the new has been misread in various ways by the scribes in both the P and S1 traditions. Although in this particular case it is obvious that the reading should be Thomas of Inde in both S1 and P, since all the texts are distanced from Julian herself in time there are no clearly consistent lines of procedure for establishing preferred readings in the long texts. However, S1's consistency in preserving an older syntax and vocabulary is something which has to be given serious weight. More fundamental questions arise when the differences between P and S1 lead to theological differences in interpretation. There are occasions when this happens and the coincidence of the passage with A gives some control on the situation. For instance a straightforward example can be seen in the following where the sentence is referring back to a showing of Christ sitting in the midst of man's soul: A (c.XXII, p.73, l.31) This was a delectabille syght &amp; a restefulle, for it is so in trowth withowten ende, and the behaldynge of this whiles we ere here es fulle plesande to god etc. S1 (c.68, p.83) This was a delectable syte and a restfull shewying: that it is so withouten end etc. P (c.68, p.644, l.46) This was a delectable syghte and a restfulle shewyng that is without ende etc. The phraseology in A and S1 make it clear that it is Jesus' presence in the soul which is without end whereas P implies that it is the showing that is without end. Similarly: A (c.XXIII, p.75, l.11 (. . . my bodeleye eyʒen I sette on the same crosse that I hadde sene comforth in before that tyme etc. S1 (c.69, p.84) My bodily eye I sett in the same cross wher I had ben in comfort aforn that tyme etc. P (c.70, p.650, l.2) Mi bodely eye I sett in the same crosse there I had seen in comforte afore that tyme etc. A and S signify that it is her beholding of the cross which provided comfort whereas the inference in P is that she had been in comfort when she saw it. In the light of the context S1 is the preferred reading, but matters are seldom so straightforward. In A Julian sees three essential qualities in her vision of a nut-sized world in the first showing—that God made it, loves it and preserves it. She then appears to ask how that relates to her and gives the answer that it means that God is her maker, lover and keeper and that she will have no true fulfillment until she is united with him. A (c.IV, p.44, l.12) In this lytille thynge I sawe thre partyes. The fyrste is that god made it, the seconde ys that he loves it, the thyrde ys that god kepes it. Botte whate is that to me? Sothelye the makere, the lovere, the kepere . For to I am substancyallye aned to hym I may nevere have love, reste ne varray blysse: that is to saye that I be so festenede to hym that thare be ryght nought that is made betwyxe my god &amp; me. P reads (c.5, p.300, l.17) In this little thing I saw iij properties. The first is þat god made it, the secund that god loueth it, the thirde that god kepyth it. But what behyld I ther in? Verely the maker, the keper, the louer . For till I am substantially vnyted to him I may never haue full reste ne verie blisse; þat is to say that I be so fastned to him that ther be right nought that is made betweene my god and me. This reading is obviously similar to that of A but the use of the verb behyld is less precise than the question and answer sequence of A, for whereas that clearly links visual showing with its more abstract significance the verb behyld blurs this to no good purpose. It seems superfluous after 'I saw iij properties' and the sentence which follows ('for till . . . me') does not relate very obviously to this assertion. The Westminster manuscript follows A (f.74 v ): But what is þis to me? Sothly þe maker þe keper and the louer. For tyll I am substantially oned etc. S1 is subtly different: (c.5, p.5) In this littil thing I saw iii properties: the first is that God made it, the second is that God loveth it, the iiid, that God kepith it. But what is to me sothly the maker, the keper, and the lover I canot tell ; for, till I am substantially onyd to him, I may never have full rest ne very blisse; etc. Although Colledge and Walsh remark on the differences between the manuscripts in their footnote to the Paris reading thus (p.300, n.18): ". . . SS and W have retained A's reading. It is not that Julian saw her creator—she saw a small spherical object—but that the object's spiritual significance for her is the Trinitarian work of creation, love and preservation. The P scribe's lapse of the pen suggests that the variant was created in this manuscript', and although they note S1's inclusion of 'I canot tell' in their textual variants, they make no mention of the fact that this variant changes the meaning. S1's 'But what is to me sothely the maker' etc. could well be accounted for as simply scribal error leaving out the 'that' in A, but the addition of the phrase 'I cannot tell' involves a change of meaning. Although she can see three characteristics peculiar to the nut-world—that God made it, loves it and preserves it—she cannot tell truly what the reality of this is for her until she is one with him. She lacks experience of complete fulfillment and is partially cut off from God by her very creatureliness. In S1 the rest of the sentence follows on sensibly from this caveat. S1's reading also chimes with the development of thought in both long versions, but further difficulties arise here. P continues: This little thing that is made, me thought it might haue fallen to nought for littenes . Of this nedeth vs to haue knowledge, that vs lyketh nought all thing that is made, for to loue and haue god that is vnmade. For this is the cause why we be not all in ease of hart and of sowle, for we seeke heer rest in this thing that is so little, wher no reste is in, and we know not our god, that is almightie, all wise and all good, for he is verie reste. S1 reads: It needyth us to have knoweing of the littlehede of creatures and to nowtyn all thing that is made for to love and have God that is unmade. For this is the cause why we be not all in ease of herete and soule etc. In S1 'It needyth . . . creatures' replaces P 'This little thing . . . littlenes' which is found in A further on in chapter IV of that text: (p.45, l.4) This lytille thynge that es made that es benethe oure ladye saynt Marye, god schewyd it vnto me als litille as it hadde beene a hasylle notte. Me thought it myght hafe fallene for litille . In the face of textual differences of this order it is no easy matter to establish a text without a high degree of subjective interpretation. All that can be said about the texts themselves is that where A, S1 and P coincide, S1 and P may each on occasion agree with A against the other. Sometimes there may be grounds for emendation, for example: S1 (c.11, p.13) And I saw truly that nothing is done be happe ne be aventure, but althing be the foreseing wisedome of God. P (c.11, p.337, l.1) . . . alle by the forsayde wysdom of god. A (c.VIII, p.49, l.31) has: forluke of the wysdome etc. W (82 v ) follows S1 with foreseeng etc. Since this is the first introduction of the subject there would be grounds for keeping the reading of S1 (Colledge and Walsh have emended their text of P accordingly). However, there can be no general rule about emending either S1 or P to agree with A since there can be no certainty of how Julian expanded her short text. Interestingly, however, it may be observed that where there are discrepancies P frequently not only modernises but is theologically less subtle. For instance: A (c.XIV, p.62, l.3) reads: In this wille oure lorde that we be occupyed, enioyande in hym, for he enioyes in vs. And þe mare plentyuouslye that we take of this with reuerence and mekenesse, the mare we deserve thanke of hym and the mare spede to ourselfe. And thus maye we saye, enioyande, Oure parte is oure lorde . S1 (c.30, p.31) has: . . . and thus, may we sey, enioyeng our part is our lord . P (c.30, p.414, l.11) And thus may see and enjoye our parte is oure lorde . The Upholland manuscript reading (f.116) is interesting here; it follows P but modernises it: In this our Lord's will is to have vs occupyed and exercise to ioy in him for he ioyeth in vs. And þe more plenteously þat we take of this (ioying in our salluation) with reuerence and humility þe more thankes we deserve of him, and þe more speedy and expedient it is to our selues. And thus we may see and enjoy or reioyce in that our part is our Lord . In both S and A there is an ambiguity: we see with joy that we share the work of salvation with Christ and Christ joys in it too. This sense is in keeping not only with other parts of the text (e.g. c.22 of the long version) but it echoes a sentence just before which is present in all the texts, I quote here from A: 'In this wille oure lorde that we be occupyed, enioyande in hym, for he enioyes in vs'. However, P (and U) take out this identification of joy—highly appropriate to a text which identifies Christ and the saved (c.51, p.59 'for Iesus is al that shal be savid and al that shal be savid is Iesus') in favour of 'And thus may we see and enjoye our parte is oure lorde'. Since we know that the Upholland manuscript was modernised and glossed in the main body of the text it is possible that something similar has occurred in P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II We should now look at some examples of differences between the two long versions in passages peculiar to them. There, the criteria for establishing preferred readings are even less certain. One method—and that often used by Colledge and Walsh—is to rely on scriptural echoes or the formulations of dogmatic theology to determine readings, but this may be at the expense of the integrity of the text itself. A comparison between a selection of variant readings will highlight the kinds of considerations that need to be taken into account in editing Julian's text. Sometimes it is the case that readings from either manuscript are justifiable without a great deal of remark, for example: S1 (c.83, p.100) reads: . . . and in clerte of light our sight shall be full; which light is God etc. P (c.83, p.725, l.24) has: . . . and in clernes of syght our lyght shalle be fulle, which light is god etc. The whole chapter is concerned with the light of God which operates in man through his reason and his faith which can light him through night to God's endless day. P implies that then, as we see clearly, our light will no longer be partial in darkness but total, perhaps an analogy to our seeing 'through a glass darkly' in this life as opposed to 'face to face' in heaven (1 Corinthians 13:12). S1 infers that we shall only see (understand) fully in the light of God, the contrast being between that state and our 'blindhede here' (c.85). There is a case for preferring S1 because it seems more consistent with the imagery in c.83 where Julian says that the light of God is only partially and fitfully seen in this life—hence our clouded reason and the need for faith—but that it will become fully revealed: 'at the end of wo, sodenly our eye shal ben openyd' and we shall see fully [understand] in clarity of 'light'; it would, however, be hard to argue that P is not also in keeping with the thought of a contrast between partial light here and full light hereafter but it conveys less coherently the depending of our seeing [understanding] on the light of God. On some occasions where the texts differ it is the case that either S1 or P are obviously superior. Thus in the following example from c.46 P obviously has the edge. S1 (c.46, p.48) But our passand lif that we have here in our sensualite knowith not what ourself is; than shal we verily and clerly sen and knowen our lord God in fulhede of ioy. Here there seems to be something missing between 'ourself is' and 'than shal we verily' etc. The sense has to be inferred. P, however, reads: (c.46, p.490, l.1) . . . knowyth nott what our selfe is but in our feyth. And whan we know and see verely and clerely what oure selfe is, than shalle we verely and clerly see etc. The awkward reading in S1 looks like scribal carelessness mistaking the first 'ourself is' for the second. Again, in c.12 where Julian sees Christ's blood overflowing the earth and descending to hell in the work of redemption S1 continues: (p.15) his dereworthy blode ascendid up into hevyn to the blissid body of our lord Iesus Christe etc. whereas P has what seems to be a happier reading: P (c.12, p.344, l.27): . . . ascendyth vp into hevyn in the blessed body etc. Conversely, in the following variants from c.13 the scribe of S1 seems to be more intelligent: S1 (p.15) God shewid that the fend hath now the same malice that he had aforn the incarnation; and as sore he travilith and as continually he seeth that all sent of salvation ascappyn him worshipply be the vertue of Cristes pretious passion; and that is his sorrow etc. P (c.13, p.347, l.13) . . . all sowles of saluacion eskape hym worshyppfully by the vertue of his precious passion. And that is his sorow etc. S1's use of Cristes passion is superior to P's use of the genitive pronoun his which obscures the distinction between Christ and the devil. Even the sent of salvation is not so awkward as it appears. Sent , here, is used in a common medieval context of divine dispensation and refers to those ordained by God to salvation. In this case though, there is no way of establishing which is closer to any original, it is simply that S1 provides a better text at this point. Similarly in c.75 (p.91) S1 reads: I saw iii maner of longing in God, and al to one end; of which we have the same in us, and of the same vertue, and for the same end . The ist is for etc. P (c.75, p.679, l.9) stops after one end and continues on, The furst etc. This looks like scribal carelessness on the part of P. This example also serves to develop further the discussion of the theological implications of P's variations. Here the reading in P blunts the sense of a theological dynamic which is one of the distinguishing features of Julian's text and which S1 often conveys more trenchantly. In this passage S1 articulates a sense of spiritual activity common to God and man: the longing in God to have us secure in his love and our longing to reach this state—a spiritual energy which Julian explores in her development of her showing on prayer. It is this aspect which renders S1 superior here, not the fact that its reading provides greater rhetorical sophistication so often found in P. 7 This kind of sensitivity to a continuum of active being between God and man which, rightly entered into, can redeem the consequences of the fall is also evident in the following passage where P and S1 offer differing readings. Julian is talking about her showing on prayer and says: S1 (c.42, p.45) Fayling of our bliss that we ben kyndly ordeynid to makyth us for to longen; trew vnderstondyng and love, with swete mynd in our savior , graciously makyth us for to trosten. P (c.42, p.473, l.56) Saworyng or seyng oure blysse that we be ordeyned to, kyndely makyth vs for to longe; trew vunderstondyng and loue with swete menyng in oure savyoure graciously makyth vs to trust. Colledge and Walsh are so confident of this reading that they emend savyoure to savoure in the text and comment (p.473, n.58): 'the emendation is self-evident, as we see from this sentence's opening, Saworyng or seyng ; and it is surprising that . . . the SS scribes copied such an error'. But it is not of course surprising that the scribe of S1 copied savior since his sentence did not begin 'saworyng or seyng'; and is it so evident that the reading of P is correct? It is true that such a reading follows on from the previous sentence: 'For prayer is a ryʒtwyss vnderstandyng of that fulhed of joy that is for to come, with tru [S1 wel] longyng and very [S1 sekir] trust', and so it would be understood that seeing this joy that we are created for makes us to long for it. But at the heart of Julian's showings is an experience not just of fulfillment and certainty in a joy that 'passyth al that herte may willen and soule may desire' (c.26, p.28) but of a feeling of grief and loss. (c.15, p.17) And in the same tyme of ioy I migte have seid with Seynt Paul: 'Nothing shal depart me fro the charite of Criste'. And in the peyne I migte have seid with Peter 'Lord, save me, I perish'. She understands that what separates her from the joy is sin (c.27). The end of chapter 42 (p.45) shortly following this disputed reading, has: But do we as we may, and sothly aske mercy and grace, al that us faylyth we shal fynd in hym; and thus menyth he wher he seith; 'I am grounde of thy besekyng'. And thus in this blisful word, with the shewing, I saw a full overcomyng agens al our wekenes and al our douteful dredis. Later, in c.43 (p.46), she says: 'And wel I wote the more the soule seeth of God, the more it desyrith hym be his grace' (which would buttress P's reading); but she continues: 'But whan we sen hym not so, than fele we nede and cause to pray—for fayling—. . .'. In the light of this evidence it does not seem clear beyond doubt that S1's 'fayling of our bliss' is an error. Further confirmation of the validity of S1 comes from a study of the continuation of this passage in both texts. S1 has: . . . than fele we nede and cause to pray— for fayling—for ablyng of ourselfe to Iesus etc. whereas P (p.478, l.29) reads: . . . for feyling and for vnablenes of oure selfe to Jhesu etc. It is interesting that in this case S1's reading is confirmed by A (c.XIX, p.69, l.19) and W (95 r ), which coincide with the long version in this passage. In addition to the fact that the reading in S1, praying out of a sense of separation from God, to close this gap, balances the opposites that follow in both texts (here quoted from S1 p.46): . . . for whan the soule is tempested troublid and left to hymself be onrest, than it is tyme to prayen to maken hymselfe supple and buxum to God etc. it continues the preoccupation with working to close the gap between God and man opened by the wedge of sin, which work is the work of redemption. Another example where S1's reading conveys a greater sense of religious experience as a dynamic reality is in c.11: (p.14): . . . me behovyd nedis to assenten with gret reverens, enioyand in God. P (c.11, p.341, l.57) reads: . . . my behovyth nedys to assent with great reverence and joy in God. The verbal formulation in S1 conveys a greater sense of participation in the 'knowyng' of God's immanence and transcendence. This ability to convey the psychological reality of theological statements can also be seen in another variant between S1 and P. In c.44 (p.47) S1 reads: God shewid in al the revelations oftentymes that man werkyth evermore his will and his wership lestyngly withoute ony styntyng. And what this worke is was shewid in the first, and that in a mervelous grounde, for it was shewid in the werkyng of the soule of our blisfull lady Seynt Mary, treuth and wisdam etc. P has (c.44, p.483, l.5): 'werkyng of the blessydfull soule of our lady sent Mary by truth and wysedom' etc. By placing 'treuth and wisdam' in apposition to what was showed in the working S1 implies that the working that God will show in Mary's soul is that of truth and wisdom; P, by the use of the preposition 'by' implies that the working was shown by truth and wisdom. Working is a key word in Julian's text running a whole gamut of shades of meaning, from labour necessary in the effort to discipline the self in spiritual life (c.41) to a working which, like that of yeast in dough, is a transforming, a rising agent: 'mercy werkyth turnyng to us althyng to good' (c.48, p.51). 8 In the first reference to the showing of Mary in c.4 of both texts Julian says that she saw that: (p.5) 'God shewid in party the wisedam and trueth of hir soule' and this was manifested in her loving relationship to God and her acceptance of his will which enabled the Incarnation. 9 The attitude of Mary at the Annunciation becomes the pattern for all men: they are the vehicles through whom the transforming dynamic of love can work, and that in man which activates this process is his truth and wisdom which is God-given and naturally beholds its source with love. This is the working of the soul (both in the sense of the way it is created and of its activity) of 'our blisfull lady Seynt Mary'. P is theologically innocuous but far less trenchant. A very similar example of a textual variant which alters emphasis can be found in c.31: S1 (p.32) reads: . . . this is his [Christ's] thirst: a love longyng to have us al togeder hole in him to his blis etc. P (c.31, p.418, l.18) has: . . . this is his thurste and loue longyng of vs, all to geder here in hym to oure endlesse blysse etc. S1 by putting love-longing to have us al togeder hole in him to his blis in apposition to Christ's thirst again gives a reading which is all of a piece with the rest of the work which stresses Christ's joy in the work of salvation 10 and also the fact that his longing to have us 'al togeder hole in him', and our longing for him (which comes from 'fayling of our blis'), are part of one continuum, 'and thow some of us fele it seldam, it passith never fro Criste till what tyme he hath browte us out of all our wo' (c.80, p.97). Colledge and Walsh render P's reading as 'Therefore this is his thirst and his love-longing for us, to gather us all here into him, to our endless joy' (n.19) and rightly refer the reader back to c.28 'I shal togeder [omitted P] gader you and make you mylde and meke, clene and holy, by onyng to me' (reading from S1, p.30), to which they footnote a scriptural parallel from Matthew 23:27 (p.410, n.19): 'How often would I have gathered together your children'. This example is argued here not to discredit P but to point to the particular qualities in S1 which P seems to dilute. It is interesting in this case to note that although there is no exact corresponding passage in A, there is in its c.XV (p.63) a definition of Christ's thirst which favours S1 in this case: 'Therefore this is the thyrste, the fayling of his blysse, þat he has vs nought in hym als haelye as he schalle thanne haffe' [i.e. at domesdaye ]. In the edition by Colledge and Walsh, the scriptural, theological or editorial authority with which they buttress readings in P are interesting and unarguable but they do not therefore prove the inadequacy of S1. Examination of further examples will also point to the validity of S1. In c.72 (p.87) Julian speaks of man cut off from the bliss of fully knowing God in 'cleerty of endless life '; P (p.659, l.7) reads lyght . This is a more predictable coupling with cleerty , but clarity of endless life, especially as glossed in the text as a fullness of experience 'him verily seand, him swetely feland, all perfectly haveand in fulhede of ioy' has a sharper metaphorical edge to it. She continues (S1, p.87): And thus was the blisfull cheere of our lord shewid in pite ; in which shewing I saw that synne is most contrarie, so ferforth that as long as we be medled with only part of synne we shall never see cleerly the blisfull cheere of our lord. P on the other hand reads (p.660, l.8): 'and thus was þe blessydfulle chere of oure lorde god shewde in perty '. Colledge and Walsh comment (p.660, n.9) that the reading of Sloane is attractive; 'but it is clear that Julian is making again the point she explains in the previous chapter: his blessyd chere lyke in perty as it shalle be in hevyn ' (c.71, p.658, l.37). Here (in c.71) Julian distinguishes between three ways in which Christ bears himself to us: 1, his passion which is relevant to us in our suffering; 2, his pity and compassion which is relevant to us in our sin; 3, his bliss that we have in part here: it is the light that informs our faith and love. She then goes on (in c.72) to talk about the mutually exclusive states of God's bliss and of sin and continues with the statement in the extract above. P's reading is unexceptionable: the fullness of bliss is only partly seen here and this prompts the realisation that sin prevents us from clearness of sight. On the other hand it is a perfectly acceptable reading that what is shown of God's bliss is shown to us in pity. Julian says (c.71, p.86) that the 'chere' of pity which preserves us in our sin is mingled with the 'chere' of bliss that informs our faith. Earlier in the text (c.28, p.29) she says: . . . I saw that our lord ioyth of the tribulations of his servants with reuth and compassion etc. At the end of c.71 (p.86) she writes concerning this, what she would call, chere of our lord: . . . that is a gracious touchyng and swete lyteyng of the gostly lefe wherby that we arn kept in sekir feith, hope and charite, with contrition and devotion and also with contemplation and [alle manner] 11 of true solace and swete comforts. The blisfull chere of our lord God werkith it in us be grace. It is the full creative joy of God which longs 'to have us al togeder hole in him' (c.31, p.32) which works in man through the Incarnation by means of compassion enabling him to work through suffering and sin to the bliss of God to which he was born. P's reading is perhaps the most immediately acceptable in this instance but one must not reject S1 too lightly. A more clear-cut example is in c.51, in the long account of the lord and the servant which does not appear in the short version. She tells us that she did not at first understand it 'and yet cowth I not taken therin ful vnderstondyng to myn ese at that tyme' (p.55) but that some meanings within it gradually unfolded for her although she still feels at the time of writing that she has not yet plumbed them all. At the point of the variant reading to be discussed she has just given an account of the basic elements of the showing and before going on to elaborate on the meanings she has understood from it she says that three things were significant in connection with these (p.55): 'and therefore me behovith now to tellen iii propertes in which I am sumdele esyd': the first is what she understood at the time; the second what she has understood since; the third the fact that this is inextricably linked with all the showings which are essentially part of one revelation. Having described the showing she says that it vanished but that she could not get it out of her mind although she could not fully understand it. She then continues in S1 (p.55): And thus in that tyme I stode mekyl in onknowing ; for the full vnderstondyng of this mervelous example was not goven me in that tyme; in which mystye example iii propertes of the revelation be yet mekyl hidde etc. P, however, reads (c.51, p.519, l.71): . . . and thus in that tyme I stode mykylle in thre knowynges , for the full vnderstandyng of this mervelouse example was not gevyn me in that tyme. In whych mysty example the pryvytes of the reuelacyon be yet moch hyd etc. Colledge and Walsh (p.519, n.70) comment that the reading thre knowynges is 'a clear example of P's superiority to SS'. It is, however, difficult to be so assured when one looks at the text. If in P the thre knowynges is referring forward to the three elements in her understanding which she then elaborates, there is an inconsistency to be noted in what she reports. She says in P that she 'stode mykylle in thre knowynges' in 'that tyme' referring to the time of her original showing. She then continues with the three things concerning her understanding of it the second of which is 'the inwarde lernyng that I have vnderstonde there in sythen'. Surely she would not in this case refer to thre knowynges at the time of the showing ('in that tyme') before the 'inwarde lernyng' had developed. The reading in S1 'mekyl in onknowyng' is more consistent with what she is saying about her original experience and the clause which follows 'for the full vnderstondyng of this mervelous example was not goven me in that tyme'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The above examples argue for greater attention and respect to be paid to S1 and it might be argued that the variant readings provided in Colledge and Walsh enable the reader to do this and to make his/her own text. However, whilst in no way wishing to appear curmudgeonly about a text produced with so much erudition, it has to be said that it is very difficult to use and in the absence of access to copies of the original manuscripts it would not be easy to be sure of readings in S1 from the footnotes provided by Colledge and Walsh. The last group of examples to be analysed demonstrate this difficulty. a). In c.34 Julian is talking about the identification between Christ as teacher and Christ as the wisdom which is taught, one way, and that a traditional one, 12 of expressing understanding of the full process of growth in Christian spiritual life to an experience of union or 'onyng' with God. S1 (p.35) reads: . . . he is the ground, he is the substance, he is the techyng, he is the techer, he is the leryd , [taught] he is the mede wherſor every kynd soule travellith etc. P (c.34, p.431, l.18) has ende instead of leryd . S1 thus not only identifies teacher and teaching, means and end, but taught, teacher and teaching. This is theologically consonant with Julian's identification of Christ and Adam in the example in c.51 which is formulated (p.59) 'Iesus is al that shal be savid and al that shal be savid is Iesus'. Such a reading is in keeping with S1's dynamic sense of theological understanding and an important variant. In their variant readings for l.18 (p.431) Colledge and Walsh suggest that S1 reads 'lend' altered by the scribe from 'leng' without any suggestion that this is at all ambiguous and despite the fact that, as they note, S2 has leryd in the text with 'lend' in the margin. In fact, a very careful comparative study of the letters of this word, which is not clearly written in S1 shows that although an r and an n are similar in this scribe's hand, the down stroke of the n is longer than that on the r. This fact, combined with a study of other instances of y d and g individually and the combinations ng ry yd elsewhere in the text, together with close scrutiny of the pen strokes in the disputed reading lead me to conclude that leryd is a reading which I would prefer to see and which certainly ought at least to be offered as a possibility. b). In c.36 Julian talks about her perception of how finally the work of redemption is to be accomplished. She sees that it is begun here and will continue until the end of time, but that then another act will take place with regard to the judgement of sin which it is not yet given to man to understand. She says that when we are tempted to speculate about this God responds: S1 (p.38): 'Lete be al thi love my dereworthy child. Entend to me, I am enow to the etc. P (p.439, l.47): Lett me aloone etc. S2 follows S1 but has me added in the margin to denote let me be all thy love etc. P's reading is easier with the implication of 'leave it to me in this matter'. S1's reading looks forward to the following 'I am enow to the' and implies that all other concerns are secondary to this trust. Colledge and Walsh register that for me aloone S1 has be al thi love but in the notes to that line (47) they comment: ' Lette me aloone , suggests the superiority of P to SS's "me be all thy love" which seems to derive from a misdivided and misread allone'. But this is not the reading of S1 and the me in the margin of S2 may simply be the emendation of a puzzled scribe, it is not grounds for emending S1 or for suggesting that this is its reading. c). In c.43 Julian talks about the experience of prayer where God is experienced as a living reality—what in conventional terms might be described as the contemplative experience of illumination; S1 (p.46): and than we can do no more but behold hym, enioyeng, with an hey migty desire to be al onyd into hym, centred to his wonyng , and enioy in hys lovyng and deliten in his godeness. P (p.480, l.42) has: . . . to be alle onyd in to hym, and entende to his motion etc. Colledge and Walsh register the variant reading in S1 as entred to his wowyng . It is easy to see in the manuscript how the third letter of wonyng might possibly be read as a w even though it is certainly not altogether like w used medially elsewhere in this text. Interestingly the Westminster manuscript reads and entende to his wowyng but the second w has been underlined and corrected above the line to n to indicate the reading wonyng . 13 This Westminster correction confirms the reading wonyng in S1 and certainly it ought at the very least to be registered as a strong possibility especially as Julian does not use the imagery of wooing or sexual love in her text. The Colledge and Walsh reading of and entred for centred depends on interpreting the more than usually open c in this scribe's hand as a very small and untypical ampersand which actually joins up with entred —the P and W readings of and entende would encourage this. In fact either entred or centred to his wonyng is consonant with Julian's understanding of the relationship between man's soul and God; thus in c.54 (p.65) she says: "Our soule is made to be Gods wonyng place, and the wonyng place of the soule is God, which is onmade". The full experience of this is the height of contemplative prayer. Colledge and Walsh (p.480, n.42) dismiss the attempt made by some commentators to interpret the reading of S1 entred to his wowyng as a reference to Julian's teaching on 'our dwelling in God' because they argue that it is tautological after 'onyd in to hym' whereas wowyng reflects the promptings of the holy spirit referred to a line or two later as 'privy tuchyngs'. But the interpretation they dismiss is at the heart of the reading of S1 as centred to his wonyng and is no more tautological than other readings in the text common to both S1 and P: S1 (c.42, p.44): . . . and in this grownd he will that we taken our stede and our wonynge [P dwellyng] etc. S1 (c.44, p.47): . . . man werkyth everymore his will and his wership lestyngly [P duryngly] withoute ony styntyng . d). In c.79 (p.96) Julian says that when we fall through weakness: "our curtes lord touchith us, stireth us and clepith us etc. " P (c.79, p.705, l.32) has: ". . . steryth vs and kepyth vs." Colledge and Walsh list the variant clepyth for S2 only. In c.80 (p.97) Julian talks of man's reason and the teaching of the church and the inward processes of the holy spirit as all from God and in S1 it is formulated that they 'werkyn in us continualy all to God' . P (p.708, l.9) has ' alle te geder '. There is another occasion on which P has to geder for S1 to God in c.72 (S1 p.87, P p.659, l.4). The implications of this last variant will not be examined here; it has been raised because on both occasions Colledge and Walsh list the variant for S1 as god yet on both occasions the manuscript capitalises the G as it does when meaning 'God' as distinct to 'good'. In c.80 the reading to God in S1 is in keeping with the sense of the constant activity of redemption at the heart of Julian's mystical understanding of Jesus being 'al that shal be savid' (c.51, p.59). The reading from P, although it is in itself unexceptionable, dilutes this sense and Colledge and Walsh deny the unwary reader the opportunity to understand what is actually written in S1. In conclusion, it would thus seem to be the case that the present state of scholarship encourages commentaries on Julian's long text which scarcely begin to recognise, if at all, that there are interpretative differences depending on which version is referred to. It is also the case that the critical edition based on P does not provide clear information about alternative readings. The lateness of the manuscripts and also the evidence provided by their collated readings together point to the unviability of any eclectic text because such an exercise involves too great a degree of subjective editorial interpretation. In accordance with the long-proven tradition of textual scholarship the conservatism and lack of concern for appearances on the part of the S1 scribe suggest that his copy may well be more reliable as a copy-text than the carefully worked over and modernised P. The more conventionally correct rhetorical structures in P may also even be attributable to scribal editing. 14 S1 bears all the evidence of a scribe trying to make a quick and straightforward copy of his source, the odd unsatisfactory reading being simply attributable to human error. Clearly there is a strong case to be made for greater recognition of the variant readings in the Julian manuscripts and for more serious attention being paid to the readings of S1 which so often convey a greater sense of theology as a live issue at the heart of human creativity. After all, this is a sense which should not be wholly unexpected in a writer seeking to directly convey her mystical experience, though it might easily have become blunted at the hands of scribes, early or late, with theologically oriented editorial ideals.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Scribe of Huntington HM 114 by Ralph Hanna III *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Medieval scribes are most appreciated when utterly anonymous. Since it is generally editors who are concerned with scribal behavior, the ideal scribe is a pellucid medium for his text. 1 Assiduously (and dully) such a person copies what he sees before him, neither adding nor (excepting inadvertence) subtracting. His errors are those of inattention and mechanical fatigue, and the text he produces is a relatively faithful representation of the exemplar from which he copies. In the context of textual criticism, where slavish fidelity is a virtue, woe be unto the scribe who thinks. For editorially, the gravest sin a copyist can perform is to wilfully refuse to transmit the text of his exemplar. Worst of all are those scribes who not only change the exemplar but who rewrite it or who conflate it by comparison with a second source. Such unfair practices, in which the scribe arrogates to himself the powers of a modern eclectic editor are, in the modern view of scribal conduct, substantial breaches and earn for the enterprising medieval copyist the greatest opprobrium. He cheated—broke faith with his authors—by not attempting to pass on what he should have believed they wrote. That individual who has become known as "the scribe of Huntington HM 114" has a certain notoriety as such a guilty fellow. Skeat examined his Piers Plowman in preparing his great edition; he rejected the text as "Not of much value," refused to collate it, and recognized that it conflated the B and C traditions of the poem. But the actual extent of the scribe's transgressions became clear only when R. W. Chambers visited the Huntington Library in the 1930s. Chambers dismissed this copy of the poem as not simply conflated (as it is) but riddled with scribal substitutions and indifference to Langland's sense and metre (as it also is). 2 Chambers's initial chagrin has since hardened into a critical dogma: all appeals denied, this scribe is an inhabitant of that peculiar purgatory reserved for those untrue to their exemplars. 3 Yet I hope, through analysis of his work, to argue that this scribe's copying procedures show far more extensive and complex features than his simple piecing together of the three texts of Piers . In fact, study of this copyist may prove instructive, not because he is a devious and conflating scribe, but because of the variety and combination of responses to Middle English texts which he exemplifies. For his stints of copying, of which three separate samples survive, range from the bizarrities of the Piers through some copies of moderate fidelity and on to others of the kind thought almost ideal—a slavish attention to the exemplar. The scribe of HM 114 is in fact responsible for two full manuscripts and a fragment of a third extended by later hands. He copied: 1. San Marino, Huntington HM 114 2. London, British Library, Harley 3943, ff. 2-7 v , 9-56 v , 63-67 v 3. London, Lambeth Palace 491, part 1 (ff. 1-290 v ) 4 This surviving output includes a certain amount of overlap—two copies of Chaucer's Troilus , a copy of a version of The Three Kings of Cologne along with a brief excerpt from that piece. Particularly outstanding, the scribe is one of the most prolific known copyists of alliterative poetry—in every case of poems which one would guess on the basis of manuscript survival to have been among the most popular such works: Piers, The Siege of Jerusalem, Susannah, The Awntyrs off Arthure . 5 The surviving codices offer substantial evidence for placing this scribe. He can be dated in two ways—by his script and, more narrowly, by the paper stocks on which he worked. The single hand which wrote all three manuscripts, a rather splayed anglicana formata, cannot be dated very precisely; it belongs to s. xv med., i.e. c. 1430-60, perhaps to s. xv 2/4 . Although none of the papers used in the Huntington and Lambeth manuscripts can be associated absolutely with precise watermarks cited by Briquet, the marks do frequently resemble types which apparently had limited periods of popularity. Thus the Lambeth manuscript appears on three papers which resemble those produced in the teens of the fifteenth century; the Huntington manuscript includes two papers probably from the early 1420s. Given that individual paper stocks had to be transported from their continental places of manufacture and that they would require a substantial period to become exhausted, each manuscript might have been produced as much as fifteen years after the date assigned the paper. 6 Thus the scribe's activity should probably be placed in the later 1420s or early 1430s. The relative dating of Lambeth before Huntington is confirmed by disposition of contents. Huntington includes a brief excerpt from The Three Kings , probably inserted to supplement a copy of Mandeville's Travels in that typically defective English form which lacks much of the description of Egypt. 7 For the excerpt to be supplied, the scribe or his director had, first, to know Mandeville and to recognize that parts of the French text were not reflected in the English version at hand. Second, they had to know an English source for some of this omitted material; the logical inference is that the scribe knew Three Kings because he had earlier copied it in Lambeth. Similarly, Harley must have preceded Huntington. The latter text presents a version of Troilus so meticulously similar to Harley that it is hard to conclude anything except that they were copied from the same archetype. But Huntington, after the copy was complete, was apparently collated against a different exemplar: in addition to a very few minor corrections, some substantial omissions of the original archetype, omissions traditionally seen as typifying the alpha version of Chaucer's poem, were corrected on inserted leaves. Knowing the defects of the archetype, it is difficult to imagine the scribe copying the text a second time without adding corrections: on this basis, Harley probably preceded Huntington but cannot be dated relatively vit à vis Lambeth. 8 The scribe can also be placed geographically. Three kinds of evidence prove useful for this purpose: dialect information inherent in his spellings, evidence of early manuscript provenance, inferences from the form of the manuscripts themselves. These in combination suggest a person from southeastern Essex probably employed in the London booktrade. The scribe's language appears fairly consistent and allows one to place at least his original training. The spellings point to a small area along the Thames estuary in southeastern Essex. However, that the scribe shows such an origin does not necessarily imply that his manuscripts were produced in that area. 9 In fact, both the appearance and contents of the codices themselves, especially Lambeth and Huntington, suggest that the manuscripts were produced after the scribe had migrated to the metropolis. Both, although large in their current numbers of folios, are composites, put together from booklets of various sizes. These range from four quires (the "oriental" materials which comprise Huntington, ff. 131-92) 10 to the thirteen quires necessary to hold the prose Brut in Lambeth (ff. 1-205). Moreover, the booklets look cheap and as if produced in the expectation that they might remain unbound for a protracted period: the paper leaves which form most of the texts are protected from outside wear and from ripping out of any interior stitching by single vellum sheets folded in quarto to provide the outermost and central leaves of each quire. These small packets of quires, minimally decorated (the scribe did nearly all his own rubrication, including running titles), look as if they might form a small in-house bookseller's stock—cheap copies of popular items in heavy demand. One has difficulty conceiving of any locale with so consistent a demand for Middle English texts as to merit even so modest productions except for the capital. Moreover, contents suggest that either the scribe or his director was intensely aware of textual contents and capable of assembling a number of archetypes with ease. The conflated Piers Plowman presupposes a scribe who knew that there were three versions of the poem, who knew how to recognize them with some facility, and who knew where to find copies of them. Similarly, the added materials in the Huntington Troilus indicate someone in a position to acquire two different archetypes of Chaucer's poem. And the effort at filling the "Egypt gap" in Mandeville implies that the scribe may not have been limited to a knowledge of English literature (although he might have known the "Cotton Mandeville ") but also perhaps knew French. The scribe's work bespeaks an extraordinary literary sophistication that one would expect within a cosmopolitan environment. This urban localization is confirmed by the Lambeth manuscript, for which there is extensive evidence of fifteenth-century ownership. Many leaves bear the repeated fifteenth-century scrawls of a very few people, among them Thomas Patsall, John Patsall, Thomas Sharp, and John Pysant. Particularly noteworthy is Thomas Patsall's inscription on f. 22 v : "in the tone of barakyng," a probable reference to Barking, Essex. 11 At some point in the first sixty or seventy years of its existence the manuscript was still owned by persons in the metropolitan area. This metropolitan localization challenges some venerable commonplaces of Middle English literary history. The scribe's access to a substantial range of alliterative texts should lead one to query conventional assumptions about the "provinciality" or the "regionalism" of this poetic mode. In fact, the scribe provides an outstanding early example of what may be termed "the fifteenth-century East Midland trickledown" of alliterative verse. Since Angus McIntosh's demonstration that Robert Thornton received his exemplar for the alliterative Morte from a south Lincolnshire source, 12 the theory that alliterative poetry was an exclusively western movement has been untenable. But whereas McIntosh hypothesized a northerly movement of alliterative materials in the east—Thornton in north Yorks. received an archetype which had migrated from a north-central Midlands locale—the abundant evidence for north to south movement of alliterative verse in the east has remained undiscussed. Indeed the manuscript popularity of the texts this scribe copied rests on the fact that they seem to have escaped "regional" circulation to become part of the literary canon generally. Two of the poems which the scribe copied are stanzaic, a type of alliterative verse which seems to have circulated with greater persistence than poems in long lines. So far as one can tell, this thirteen-line stanza first appeared no later than 1375-85 and probably in south Yorks. or north Lincs.; such at least is the best provenance one can assign to the earliest of these poems, Susannah . 13 Such an identification allows one to generalize about the dissemination of all the alliterative verse copied by the scribe, excluding Piers Plowman : all of it relies, so far as one can trace it back, on Yorkshire archetypes which gradually penetrated southward through the east Midlands. The dissemination of The Siege of Jerusalem is fairly typical, both of this history and of the scribe's handling of alliterative poetry—which is considerably more careful than the published accounts, which concentrate on the Piers , would have one believe. The scribe of HM 114 received The Siege in a form which had been current since the turn of the fifteenth century, a quite debilitated scribal version which extends from the opening at least up to line 900 of the text. Readings which generate this version first appear in the Yorkshire Petre MS., now in the Robert Taylor collection at Princeton. In the Petre/Taylor MS., the scribe either stopped his textual distortions around line 900 or shifted to a better exemplar. This same split form of the text with readings more advanced in error than Petre, and resembling those of yet other manuscripts, was also available to the most dishonest and latest copyist of The Siege , the central East Midland scribe who prepared Cotton Caligula A.ii. 14 This version of lines 1-900 with extensive errors derived from readings like those of Petre provided a koine used by other copyists. Beyond the scribes of Caligula and Lambeth 491, Cambridge University Library Mm.v.14, copied by the known London scribe Richard Frampton, shows this form of the text. 15 And so does Huntington HM 128, which introduces an entertaining fillip in this narrative: this rather complicated manuscript was apparently copied (this portion perhaps as late as the 1440s) in a Warwickshire religious community. Such a provenance suggests that later western circulation of The Siege (the earliest copy, Laud Misc. 656 is appropriately western, from north Oxfordshire) went on only after the text had made a circuitous journey from the north, down the eastern side of the country, through London, and thence to what has usually been considered the alliterative homeland. Similar transmission histories can be constructed for the other poems. Although Susannah shows signs of Yorkshire origin, no northern copy survives. The earliest texts are those in the Worcester Vernon and Simeon manuscripts, but these, as A. I. Doyle has suggested for other works included in these codices, may derive from exemplars acquired from the metropolis. 16 Otherwise, Susannah shows only an East Midland circulation—not just HM 114, very closely related to the Vernon-Simeon archetype and again a relatively faithful copy, but Morgan M 818 from south Lincs. and again the ubiquitous Caligula A.ii. 17 And the Lambeth 491 copy of The Awntyrs off Arthure clearly came to the scribe of HM 114 etc. from Yorkshire; it is palpably (and again relatively faithfully) related to that used by Robert Thornton to produce his copy in Lincoln Cathedral 91. Although it carries one some distance away from considering the actual behavior of the HM 114 scribe, it is worth pausing a moment to consider some further evidence for the East Midland alliterative connection. First, there is simply the vast amount of surviving alliterative verse from clearly eastern locales and composed in stanzas. As any reader of The Castle of Perseverance or the "Ludus Coventriae" will recognize, verse in the thirteen-line stanza with greater or lesser alliterative decoration is a common métier of fifteenth-century East Anglian drama. 18 In that context it persisted throughout the century and as far south as Essex, the locale where someone composed a few odd stanzas in the unpublished moralities of Winchester College 33. Moreover, eastern transmission of alliterative verse and metropolitan interest in this transmission extend past the end of the middle ages. Wynkyn de Worde published versions of two alliterative poems; for one of these, William of Palerne , probably a Gloucestershire poem and one which we know otherwise only from a mid-fourteenth-century western copy, he apparently commissioned a prose redaction. 19 But the second alliterative publication shows a by-now familiar pattern: it is a full text of The Quatrefoil of Love , another stanzaic poem. 20 Moreover, it is again a stanzaic poem earliest traceable in Yorkshire (Thornton's Additional 31042) and again a text with at least some later Northeast Midland distribution through the second known manuscript, Bodleian Additional A.106, probably from more southerly parts of Yorkshire. Such an East Midland dissemination has substantially affected the quality of the alliterative texts presented by the scribe of HM 114. But textual quality and fidelity of transmission are not altogether the same things, for scribes may be precluded from transmitting good texts by the nature of those archetypes available to them and yet they may reproduce those archetypes with some care and accuracy. The Lambeth 491 text of The Awntyrs , which is conceivably older than Thornton's copy, must remain an open question: there the denorthernizing of the text may be the activity of this scribe. But in the case of the other, more widely attested texts, collation indicates that the scribe transmitted the archetypes with which he was working with some care, and perhaps more care than colleagues with access to similar copies. 21 Quite simply, the East Midland pre-circulation of the archetypes available to the scribe had a disastrous effect on textual quality. This tradition of copying was of a predictable sort, primarily concerned with normalization of lexicon, occasionally with recasting misunderstood lines. In the case of The Siege of Jerusalem , the agreement of all four East Midland manuscripts in readings (and their frequent agreement with the Petre/Taylor copy) can establish fairly accurately the readings of the debilitated archetype available to the scribe. Thus the correct version of Siege 50, "Ouer þe Grekys grounde myd þe grym yþes" was subjected to three substitutions of synonyms and emerged in all these copies as "Ouer þe Grekys see wiþ þe grym wawes ," a nonmetrical form. (Petre reads "grounde," "on," and "waghes.") But if the scribe's archetype allowed him only limited access to a genuine text, he remained generally fastidious about the text he did receive. Especially when compared to the copyists of HM 128 and Caligula, he is frequently careful and retains readings probably archetypal which other scribes had no qualms about suppressing. Thus at Siege 248, he preserves apparently authorial (and archetypal) diol , while HM 128 and Caligula substitute sorwe and Cambridge drede ; in the next line, Cambridge and Lambeth retain correct authorial vis/visage , while Caligula reads face and HM 128 nose ; and at Siege 258 Cambridge and Lambeth preserve the northernism garte , but Caligula and HM 128 substitute made it . Moreover, on some widely spaced occasions, the Lambeth scribe shows himself capable of decent innovation. Unlike many East Midland copyists, he did understand the metrical and stanzaic conventions of the works he copied; and he did make some efforts at correcting archetypal deficiencies to preserve these conventions. 22 That these are frequently wrong guesses (and further examples of that tinkering which has merited opprobrium in the past) should not lead one to minimize their potential intelligence. Thus at Siege 118, "To take careyns kynde of a clene mayde," the East Midland archetype had rendered the sense absolutely irrecoverable through two stages of error. First, as Petre and Thornton's Additional 31042 indicate, "careynes kynde" was converted to the compound "carlemannes kynde." The four East Midland manuscripts reduce this reading still further and provide only "To take mannes kynde . . . ." The Lambeth scribe alone worried over the failure of alliteration in the line and was aware enough of alliterative style to hypothesize "To cacche mannes kynde." Again, at Siege 680, six of the seven surviving copies present a nonmetrical line "As sone as þe rede day ros on þe schye." Given the universality of the wrong reading, the Lambeth scribe is almost certainly emending; but he emends to the otherwise hypothetical authorial reading, "As rathe as þe rede day . . . ." Further testimony to the scribe's frequent interest in fidelity comes from his most extensive copying stint, his two reproductions of Chaucer's Troilus . Once again, one here needs to distinguish textual quality from textual fidelity. The two texts, HM 114 and Harley 3943, deviate from all other copies of Chaucer's poem; R. K. Root believed their version of the text so distinctive that he identified it as a Chaucerian early draft, which he called alpha. 23 But these distinctive scribal errors (for there seems to me little likelihood that Chaucer is responsible for much, if any, of this variation) are almost certainly not the product of the scribe himself. First, they can be partially parallelled in the slightly earlier copy in Cambridge University Library Gg.iv.27. 24 Second, neither HM nor Harley was copied from the other since each has unique, although usually very minor, readings not in the other. 25 But in the overwhelming majority of instances, in excess of ninety percent, where the texts vary from Robinson's or Windeatt's textus acceptus, they vary together. These two facts suggest that the scribe again had access to a relatively poor archetype; the persistent agreements of the two copies demonstrate how scrupulously he tried to reproduce it. Some further proof of this accurate rendition, and of a general interest in accuracy on the part of the scribe, comes from corrections in the HM 114 Troilus . The text was read over, perhaps twice—if so, once from the archetype also used to produce Harley, as well as (that deviousness taken as typical of this writer, once again) from a second source not textually related to the first. A first layer of corrections generally makes Harley and HM 114 more alike and presumably attends to passages the scribe had botched in his original copying. For example, words accidentally omitted are supplied (so "me" I:714, "nay" I:770, and "more" I:819). Given the triviality of the errors corrected, however, one cannot be sure of their source, whether free guesses, from the original archetype, or from an independent source. 26 The remaining corrections are more interesting. This sporadic group of readings is probably the result of spot consultation and corrects minor errors (although very few of the distinctive variants Root called alpha) which HM 114 shares with Harley. These are converted to the correct readings of other copies. For example, both manuscripts omit the word "loue" in I:436; HM 114 interlines it. (Similarly the shared omissions II:529 "syche" and II:1074 "were" are corrected.) On both copyings the scribe seems to have found no line in the archetype corresponding to II:509 but recognized the loss on the basis of disruption of the stanza form; in HM 114 he supplies the line later in the blank he left for it. (In contrast, at II:250 the archetype lacked a line, a fact the scribe failed to recognize in either copying; he added it marginally in HM 114, and another scribe similarly corrected Harley.) The act of substantive correction itself indicates an unusual fastidiousness about the text; what is striking is that this care and interest here takes the form modern editors regard as their own prerogative (and thus as a scribal sin), the consultation of extra copies. This is especially true of the major correction effort undertaken by the scribe. That is, he (and not R. K. Root) discovered that the alpha archetype did not include Chaucer's entire poem. Root distinguished alpha, at least initially, by its failure to provide three extensive passages, Troilus's hymn to love (III:1744-71), his temple speech on predestination (IV:953-1085), and the description of his apotheosis (V:1807-27). 27 These were not originally included in HM 114; either the scribe learned informally of parts of the poem he hadn't copied or in his use of a different archetype for corrections, he discovered these. 28 He carefully copied them out on leaves from the same paper-stocks used elsewhere in the volume and inserted them into his already completed quires. 29 At this point, I should think, textual scrupulousness and infidelity to the received text have perplexingly merged. Rather than being a figure guilty and immoral, as traditionally perceived, the scribe of HM 114 proves to be immoral (if that is the right term) precisely because he is so fastidiously committed to the accurate presentation of his texts. Yet in every instance, such fastidiousness is qualified: the scribe is not a modern editor. Thus, although he corrects many features of his received alpha version of Troilus , it never occurred to him to correct them all, to do a full collation and enter it in his copy. Similarly, however conscious of alliterative mannerism and alliterative requirements, he left many palpably unsatisfactory lines in his copies of those poems. The main charge which might be leveled against the scribe, then, would not be unscrupulousness, but inconsistency. Although he often attends to details of the texts, that attention never achieves the status of a principled and persistent scrutiny. The scribe's prose copying offers support to this finding. There the copyist displays the same variable responses to the received texts already discussed, although efforts at fidelity to the larger textual tradition are lacking. The Brut of Lambeth 491, for example, appears a generally faithful copy; so far as I have collated it, its readings correspond with those printed by Brie as the textus acceptus, and variation is minimal and minor. The less extensive Lambeth Three Kings text seems to be unique. 30 When the scribe copied an excerpt from the archetype into what became HM 114, he began with much the same scrupulousness as he exercised on the Brut , but, as the copying proceeded, he grew more and more prone to paraphrase and summary; the concluding pages come to resemble his rendition of Mandeville's Travels , as described by Seymour. Possibly, the scribe felt that prose did not demand the same attention to ipsissima verba as poetry did; in any event, none of the works shows anything comparable to the various efforts at textual recovery and recuperation involved in the verse texts. The scribe of HM 114's various approaches to his texts suggest that conceptions like fidelity and independent error, the tools of the editor, do not provide absoute ways of judging scribal behavior. Certainly, insofar as scribes are merely the vehicles for transmitting literary texts, the frustration which modern editors experience may extenuate, if not justify such attention as the HM 114 scribe has received. But clarity of transmission is not, after all, necessarily the raison d'être of scribal behavior. Scribes are also directly implicated in literary history. The forms in which they choose (or are directed) to transmit texts reflect conscious choices and thus inherently attitudes toward or readings of the works they receive. Certainly completeness of reproduction is one favored textual response of the scribe under discussion. He apparently found versions of texts he knew incomplete and went to some lengths to fill them out into composite versions. This is not such an unusual response; it can be widely parallelled in A-Text manuscripts of Piers , where B- and C-Texts are often subjoined. The HM 114 scribe perhaps most resembles the copyist of Bodley 851: both share an awareness of deviant textual detail which needs to be concorded to produce a full and thus acceptable text. 31 But elsewhere, the scribe shows other sorts of judgements, often ones highly inconsistent and perhaps text-specific in their operation. Thus the scribe retains, so far as he is able, certain contours of alliterative poetry which one might label "provincial." At the same time, he modernizes the text of Piers with some rigor and there seems to desire a standardized and familiarized readable text. Attention to all these features (and to their inconsistency) is lost by concentration upon the scribe as simply a textual vehicle. He becomes uncollatable and untrustworthy. Moreover, since editors typically deal with only single texts, they lose any overall sense of the scribe as a transmitter. He becomes unrecoverable, since his procedures are fragmented into the dispersed collations of separate critical editions. Attention to scribes as the creators of literary history is a desideratum, but it can be accomplished only by studies which look over a broad cross-section of a total oeuvre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix: Manuscript Descriptions London, British Library, Harley 3943 This manuscript is quite adequately described in Robert Kilburn Root, The Manuscripts of Chaucer's Troilus , Chaucer Soc. 1 ser. 98 (1914; rep. New York: Johnson, 1967), pp. 17-24, with photographs of all four hands. I would make only the following additions to Root's account: Page size 255 x 135 mm (writing area 204 x 86 mm). Catchwords regular at quire ends; leaf signatures are almost universally cropped, the only survivors being f i-iiij, in two different inks (brown for quire, blue for leaf number) on ff. 41-44. Unlike the scribe's other manuscripts, where he used wire lines of the paper to guide his writing, this manuscript is pricked (esp. visible on ff. 19-32, 34-48), fully bounded (in purplish-brown crayon), and ruled. The portion copied by the scribe under discussion is a fragment, presumably found some years later and extended (with supply of a lost bifolium (quire 1, leaves 1+8, ff. 1+8) and quire (quire 8, ff. 57-62) to make a full text. The three hands responsible for this extension I would date s. xv med. or s. xv¾. Ff. 56 and 63 (the end of quire 7 and the head of quire 9) show particularly heavy wear, a fact which suggests an extensive period as an unbound fragment. San Marino, Huntington Library HM 114 Again described quite accurately by Root, Manuscripts , pp. 35-36 (with photograph of the hand); and by M. C. Seymour, "The English Manuscripts of Mandeville's Travels," Transactions of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society 4, v (1965-66):167-210, at 188-189. I would add the following information: Page size: 295 x 140 mm. (writing area 165 x 100 mm.). The manuscript is fascicular, comprised of three booklets—ff. 1-130 (quires 1-8, Piers Plowman ); ff. 131-192 (quires 9-12, orientalia: Mandeville's Travels, Susannah , an excerpt from The Three Kings ); ff. 193-325 (quires 13-20, Troilus and a unique translation of Peter Ceffons of Clairvaux's Epistola Luciferi ad Cleros ). The scribe clearly produced the text in three sections to be joined, since at the foot of the final verso of each booklet what is probably his informal hand gives a count of the quires: "quaternus (?) 8 quarus" on f. 130 v , "q—4 quares" on f. 192 v , "ad 8 quares summa 20" on f. 325 v . Catchwords regular at quire ends within booklets; leaf signatures (when not cropped) are simply arabic numerals, apparently regular for the first half of all quires. The manuscript is of mixed vellum and paper; typically in each quire a single vellum sheet was folded in quarto around three paper sheets. Five different paperstocks occur, with quires often mixtures of the various stocks, and occasionally mixtures of half- and full sheets. These marks include: a Monts, like Briquet 11872 (Pisa 1420-21), somewhat less like 11876 (Trévise, 1437). This stock is the exclusive form used in quires 1-5 (although quire 3 includes an unwatermarked sheet, ff. 38+39+42+43), 9, and 13 (with an unwatermarked sheet, ff. 196+197+204+205); with single sheets from other sources, it also appears in quires 6, 7, and 20. There are single examples in quires 15 and 16 (the mark on ff. 229+236, 247+250), and two examples (one perhaps a half-sheet) in quire 17. b Joug, not in Briquet but most resembles 7873 (Sion 1410). A single sheet of this stock appears in quire 6 (the mark on ff. 82+95). c Hache, like Briquet 7505 (Tirlemont 1378, with variants to 1412). Single sheets of this stock appear in quires 7 (the mark on ff. 99+112) and 20 (the mark on ff. 312+ 320); there are two sheets in quire 15 (the mark on ff. 226+239, 231+234). d Cloche, like Briquet 3982 (Udine 1420-23). This stock is the exclusive form used in quires 8, 10-12, 14, and 18 (including one of the insert leaves). There are two sheets in quires 16 and 17 (one example in this quire perhaps a half-sheet), and a single example in quire 19 (the mark on ff. 297+302). e either Basilic or Griffon, not clearly identifiable with any Briquet stock. This stock appears only in quire 19, probably two full sheets and a half-sheet. London, Lambeth Palace 491, part 1 Because of some serious (and quite unexpected, given the author) mistakes in the published description—Montague Rhodes James and Claude Jenkins, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Lambeth Palace (1930-32), pp. 681-684—I offer more extensive details. Booklet I (ff. 1-216) 1. ff. 1-205 v The English prose Brut , acephalous and ending with the reign of Edward III. 2. ff. 206-216 v The alliterative Siege of Jerusalem , lines 1-632. Collation: [quire 1 lost] 2 16 (lacks 7, 10) 3-5 16 6 16 (lacks 5, 7, 10, 12) 7 16 (lacks 2, 15) 8 16 (lacks 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) 9 16 (lacks 7, 10) 10 16 (lacks 7, 10, 14) 11 16 12 16 (lacks 7) 13 16 (lacks 9) 14-16 16 . I have discussed the logic for a split in production in mid-text at Studies in Bibliography 39 (1986):105-106. Booklet II (ff. 217-74) 1. ff. 217-227 v The Siege of Jerusalem concluded. 2. ff. 228-274 v A unique English prose translation of The Three Kings of Cologne . Collation: 1 16 2 16 (lacks 2, 15) 3 16 4 16 (lacks 3, 14, 15, 16). Booklet III (ff. 275-90) 1. ff. 275-286 v The alliterative Awntyrs off Arthure . 2. ff. 287-290 v The verse Book of Hunting , breaking off at line 349. Collation: 1 16 , with remainder lost. 291 ff. (150 repeated in the numeration); after four leaves of modern paper (ff. 291-94), there follows a separate codex (ff. 295-329), described Robert E. Lewis and Angus McIntosh, A Descriptive Guide to the Manuscripts of the Prick of Conscience, Medium Ævum Monographs n.s. 12 (Oxford: Society for the Study of Medieval Language and Literature, 1982), pp. 80-81. Page size 222 x 141 mm. (writing area 175 x 80/85 mm.). Catchwords at quire ends. There are two sets of leaf signatures. (a) In first halves of quires, rectos are signed at page foot with letter and arabic numeral, although most have been cropped; in this system, ff. 1-274= b-v. (b) Each recto in ff. 1-205 is signed in the upper right corner with a quire and leaf number, both in arabic (these run 2.1-16.5). The manuscript is on mixed vellum and paper, prepared as HM 114. Excepting two unwatermarked sheets (ff. 4+5+10+11 in quire 2 and ff. 202+203+212+213 in quire 16), the sheets appear in large blocks of the same stock, all, so far as one can determine, full sheets. The watermarks include: a Monts, like Briquet 11685 (Trévise 1405, with variants to 1414); one might also compare 11687 (Padua 1408-15) and 11689 (Florence 1411-21). With the exception of the unwatermarked sheet mentioned above, this stock is the exclusive form in quires 2-13. b Lettre N, not in Briquet, most like 8431 (1414-20) but on the chain-line and lacking the cross. With the exception of the unwatermarked sheet mentioned above, this stock is the exclusive form in quires 14-16. c Ciseaux, like Briquet 3656 (Perpignan 1397, with north Italian variants to 1413); one might also compare 3656 (Aix-en-Provence 1426). This stock is the exclusive form in quires 17-21.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I am grateful to the Committee on Research, the University of California at Riverside, which has helped defray transportation costs so that I could examine all three manuscripts. Derek Pearsall first suggested to me that HM 114 might be an object worthy of study; A. I. Doyle has been constantly encouraging and generous with his wealth of information about Middle English manuscripts. 1 See E. T. Donaldson's good-humored yet derisive summary of such views, "The Psychology of Editors of Middle English Texts," in Speaking of Chaucer (1970), p. 110. 2 See Walter W. Skeat, The Vision of William Concerning Piers the Plowman (2 vols., 1886), II:lxx; and R. W. Chambers, "The Manuscripts of Piers Plowman in the Huntington Library and their Value for Fixing the Text of the Poem," Huntington Library Bulletin 8 (1935): 1-27, esp. pp. 2, 15. Interestingly, Chambers believes in the necessary stupidity of the "good" scribe and cites Housman for support; see pp. 7-8. George Kane and Donaldson refuse to collate the manuscript for their edition, Piers Plowman: The B Version (1975), because of the frequency of textual deviation, not limited to conflation; see pp. 14-15. 3 G. H. Russell and Venetia Nathan, "A Piers Plowman Manuscript in the Huntington Library," Huntington Library Quarterly 26 (1963):119-130, do not speculate on the agent responsible for the Piers , the conflations in which they describe with care. M. C. Seymour, "The Scribe of Huntington Library MS. HM 114," Medium Ævum 43 (1974):139-143, gave the scribe a name and an individuality. 4 Descriptive information follows in the appendix; there I make use of the concept of the "booklet" as developed by P. R. Robinson; see "The 'Booklet,' a Self-Contained Unit in Composite Manuscripts," Codicologica 3 (1980):46-69. 5 See A. I. Doyle, "The Manuscripts," in David A. Lawton ed., Middle English Alliterative Poetry and its Literary Background (1982), pp. 88-100, 142-147, esp. pp. 94 and 144, nn. 22-23. 6 For probable identifications of the paper stocks, see the Appendix. On the life of papers, see the discussion of Jean Irigoin, "La Datation des filigranes du papier," Codicologica 5 (1980):9-36, esp. pp. 21-22. 7 For a description of the so-called "Egypt gap," see M. C. Seymour, "The Irish Version of Mandeville's Travels," Notes and Queries 208 (1963): 364-366, at p. 364. The excerpt lifted from The Three Kings describes the garden of balm in Egypt, a sight which appears in ch. 7 of the Cotton version; see Seymour, Mandeville's Travels (1967), pp. 35-37. 8 Although other explanations are possible, they seem generally less plausible. For example, Huntington could be considered earlier than Harley, were one to assume that the correcting archetype did not remain available to the scribe when he came to copy the latter. Or the manuscripts might have been simultaneous productions, but only the completed Huntington ready for corrections when the manuscript containing them came to hand. 9 I am grateful to the generosity of Angus McIntosh for material on the scribe's dialect. See McIntosh, Michael Benskin, and M. L. Samuels, A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English (4 vols., 1986), 1:194, where the scribe is placed in the Rayleigh area (scribe 6030, grid 578 190). There is a developing literature on scribal migration; see my "The Origins and Production of Westminster School MS. 3," Studies in Bibliography 41 (1988): 197-218; M. L. Samuels, "Langland's Dialect," Medium Ævum 54 (1985):232-247; and A. I. Doyle, "Remarks on Surviving Manuscripts of Piers Plowman ," in G. Kratzmann and J. Simpson eds., Medieval English Religious and Ethical Literature: Essays in Honour of George Russell (1986), pp. 35-48. 10 Conceivably the final booklet of Lambeth was shorter, only two quires, but all material after f. 290 has been lost. 11 Carol Meale of York is pursuing research on the Patsalls and their ownership of Lambeth 491. 12 "The Textual Transmission of the Alliterative Morte Arthure ," in Norman Davis and C. L. Wrenn eds., English and Medieval Studies Presented to J. R. R. Tolkien (1962), pp. 231-240. 13 The localization is based upon features preserved in rhyme—Old English ā both retained as ā and raised to q̄ (thus close to the border between these features) and OE ēag/ēah rhyming as ē (see lines 271 and 337), a highly restricted feature in northern areas. 14 In addition to the Kölbing-Day edition of the poem (EETS 188), J. R. Hulbert has discussed the relations of the manuscripts; see "The Text of The Siege of Jerusalem," Studies in Philology 28 (1931):602-612. I am grateful to Jean Preston for providing me a microfilm and an opportunity to examine the Petre/Taylor MS. 15 Frampton also copied two Duchy of Lancaster coucher books (now PRO D.L. 42, 1 and 2), Glasgow Univ. Library, Hunterian T.4.1 (two Latin historical texts which also appear in the Cambridge manuscript), a two-volume breviary for Henry IV (now lost), and Huntington HM 19920 ( Statuta ). See A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes, "The Production of Copies of the Canterbury Tales and the Confessio Amantis in the Early Fifteenth Century," in Parkes and Andrew G. Watson eds., Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts, and Libraries: Essays Presented to N. R. Ker (1978), pp. 163-210, esp. pp. 192-195 and nn. On the manuscripts of The Siege , see Doyle, "The Manuscripts," pp. 93-96, 143-144 (nn. 17-29); on HM 128 and Morgan M 818 (mentioned in the next paragraph), see Doyle, Piers , pp. 40, 42. The Morgan manuscript provides further evidence of south to north transmission in the east: it eventually returned to Yorkshire, where it belonged to the Ingilbys of Ripley Castle. 16 See "The Shaping of the Vernon and Simeon Manuscripts," in Beryl Rowland ed., Chaucer and Middle English Studies Presented to Rossell Hope Robbins (1974), pp. 328-341; and "University College, Oxford, MS. 97 and its relationship to the Simeon Manuscript (British Library Add. 22283)," in Michael Benskin and M. L. Samuels eds., So meny people longages and tonges (Edinburgh: privately, 1981), pp. 265-282. For a similar example of London exemplars making their way to the provinces, cf. Harley 7333, based in part on John Shirley archetypes but copied by the Austin canons of Leicester. 17 This manuscript contains a further alliterative poem, the unique copy of Chevalere Assigne . 18 For the fullest listing, see Thorlac Turville-Petre, "'Summer Sunday', 'De tribus regibus mortuis', and 'The Awntyrs off Arthure': Three Poems in the Thirteen-Line Stanza," Review of English Studies 25 (1974):1-14, esp. pp. 12-14. To these uses, one can add, depending on the extent to which one chooses to take specific line-lengths and persistent alliteration as typifying the form, a number of other examples. Dux Moraud , in addition to the examples cited, contains at lines 46-54 a fragment of a full stanza. Turville-Petre's listing from "Ludus Coventriae" ignores seventeen further examples of the stanza, in a variety of metres, line-lengths, and rhyme-schemes: the entire "Proclamation" play; "The Creation and Fall" 1-91, 100-138, 143-272, 365-416; "Cain and Abel" 1-13, 32-44, 79-91, 105-195; "Noah" 1-117; "The Betrothal of Mary" 1-91, 116-141, 146-154, 171-183, 203-228, 242-254, 259-297, 354-408, 474-486; "Joseph's Return" 21-46, 49-61, 71-83, 147-159, 180-192; "The Adoration of the Shepherds" 1-13, 90-102; "The Adoration of the Magi" 69-94, 216-229; "Herod" 9-21, 28-40, 129-284; the entire "Baptism" play; the entire "Temptation" play; "The Passion I" 183-221, 462-513; "The Passion II" 17-29; "The Ascension" 18-43, 57-95; "Pentecost" 14-39; "The Assumption" Prologue 1-26, and play 1-80, 127-139, 149-161, 343-460, 468-494; the entire "Doomsday" play. In addition, two of The Digby Plays , generally in syllabic verse, include a number of stanzas—"Mary Magdalene" 114-126, 313-325, 381-393, 602-614, 938-949, 979-992, 1336-348, 1754-766, and a few fourteen-line variants, e.g. 452-465; "Christ's Burial and Resurrection" 1-13, 1147-1236, 1608-620. There are also a few stanzas, some fully alliterative, in the unpublished dialogue or morality play "Occupation and Idleness" ( Index of Middle English Verse Sup. 3430.5), in Winchester, St. Mary's College 33A, ff. 65-73 v ; these occur at lines 1-26, 32-44, 192-204, 218-229 (with a line dropped). See Norman Davis, "Two Middle English Dialogues and their Language," Revue des langues vivantes 35 (1969), esp. pp. 464-465, with quotation of lines 1-13 and 192-195. Further, three brief alliterative poems deserve at least notice here; because of differing handling of the "bob and wheel" at stanza end, they have fourteen lines to the stanza, rather than thirteen: "St. John the Evangelist," "St. John the Baptist," and Richard Spalding's "St. Catherine." Turville-Petre has printed two additional alliterative poems composed in the East Midlands; see "The Lament for Sir John Berkeley," Speculum 57 (1982):332-339 (associated with Wymondham, Leices., c. 1375); and "The Battle of Brackonwet," in Derek Pearsall ed., Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England (1983), pp. 137-138 (associated with the Notts.-Derbys. border, fifteenth century). 19 See G. H. V. Bunt, William of Palerne (Groningen: Bouma's Boekhuis, 1985), pp. 23-26 (for discussion) and pp. 328-331 (for a text of the fragment, now lost). 20 See N. F. Blake, "Wynkyn de Worde and the Quatrefoil of Love," Archiv 206 (1969):189-200. de Worde's editorial alterations of the text, which Blake neatly categorizes, show considerable continuity with earlier scribal behavior and thus provide a useful introduction to both the East Midlands dissemination of alliterative verse and to the HM 114 handling of textual detail in Piers Plowman . 21 The raw materials for a study of Susannah parallelling that of The Siege below are available in the collations of A. A. Miskimin's edition (1969). Generally speaking, Vernon and Simeon are derived from the same archetype as HM 114, but with at least one intervening copying. HM 114 retains a substantial number of archetypal readings rejected in this process; cf. among many others, 303 "a senek," retained in HM, but Vernon-Simeon "askede." But the archetype common to all three manuscripts, like that behind East Midland copyings of The Siege , already contained a number of errors which rendered it less satisfactory than the copies available to the Morgan and Caligula scribes; cf. 289 "fonned," but "fendes" in HM, Vernon, and Simeon. For fuller information on the variants of The Siege , see the collations in EETS 188 (although the Petre/Taylor manuscript was not available for the edition). 22 Thus the scribe was persistently aware of repetition as a formal device in The Awntyrs and occasionally intensified it beyond what other manuscripts would suggest was in his archetype. 23 The Textual Tradition of Chaucer's Troilus , Chaucer Society 1 ser. 99 (1916; rep. New York: Johnson, 1967). 24 This manuscript, as I hope to show elsewhere, derived its copy of Troilus by the quire from several different dismembered manuscripts; as a consequence, only portions of the text represent what Root called alpha (and are thus comparable to HM 114 and Harley 3943). 25 The majority of these variants are metrical in nature—retention or loss of - e , often with concomittant supply or suppression of compensating syllables, y - and - en , for example. 26 That some of the readings cannot have come from the archetype shared with Harley may imply only a single act of correction against an otherwise unrelated manuscript. For example, II:530 appears in both copies in the same non-metrical form "As likith the but from desperaunce"; in HM 114 "derke" is interlined after "from." HM 114 omitted II: 26; it is supplied, but in a form which includes "sped," not the erroneous "did" of Harley. 27 See Textual Tradition , pp. 155-157, 216-222, 245-248. 28 Harley lacks the hymn to love, the only one of these passages which occurs in the portion of the manuscript copied by this scribe. 29 The scribe had already signed the quires, and the inserted leaves disrupt the signature sequences. For example, in quire 17 (ff. 257-273), f. 264 is signed "7," although the addition of the hymn to love on f. 261 renders this now the eighth leaf. 30 Frank Shaer of the University of Adelaide is investigating this text and other versions of The Three Kings . 31 I find unconvincing the arguments for Bodley 851 as an authorial version put forward by A. G. Rigg and Charlotte Brewer, Piers Plowman: The Z Version (Toronto: Pontifical Institute, 1983). Certainly, that the HM 114 scribe was capable of similar textual concordance undercuts considerably the uniqueness of the activities Rigg and Brewer describe and would attribute to the author.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">F. N. Robinson's Editing of the Canterbury Tales by Roy Vance Ramsey *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After its appearance in 1933, F. N. Robinson's text of the Canterbury Tales steadily took the place of W. W. Skeat's as the one scholars taught from and cited in their professional articles. 1 This continued to be true despite the appearance in 1940 of The Text of the Canterbury Tales , ed. by John M. Manly and Edith Rickert (Manly-Rickert), with full collations and analyses of and a text based upon all of the manuscripts (Robinson had avowedly based his text upon ten), and despite data and analyses in Manly-Rickert which proved the faultiness of earlier analyses of manuscript relations to which Robinson had subscribed in his textual introduction. Not only have that first Robinson text and the little-changed second one of 1957 been cited as standard for well over fifty years, but the appearance in 1987 of a very lightly emended "Third Edition," under the general editorship of Larry D. Benson, makes the continued scholarly use of it as the standard text of the Canterbury Tales a possible, if not a likely, prospect. Such past, present and possible future uses of this text make particularly urgent a better and more general understanding of the methods by which Robinson edited because, as the present study will seek to indicate, careful analysis fails to support the belief of others and of Robinson himself in his textual methods and in his text of the Canterbury Tales .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A. The Initial Reception of Robinson's Text As George Reinecke noted of the reviews of the first edition, "the Chaucer student who has grown up in a world where Robinson is something of a fixture may well be surprised at the inconclusive nature of these evaluations, the rather small number of which is also surprising." 2 The one who wrote of the text in the friendliest terms, J. S. P. Tatlock, lauded the editor for choosing the via media between the eclecticism of "the literary man," Skeat, and the automatic registration of the consensus of the best manuscripts by the textual genealogist, John Koch. But in his lavish praise of the text, Tatlock clearly came down on the side of the habit by 'the literary man' of overbearing manuscript testimony; nonetheless, he raised a question about Robinson's full knowledge of the manuscript evidence, noting "that the editor shows little awareness of the inaccuracy in minor details of the Chaucer Society's printed editions of the manuscripts," 3 the avowed primary sources of Robinson's decisions. What Tatlock himself failed to note was the role played in Robinson's text by the manuscript which Tatlock had earlier attacked so vehemently, Harley 7334 (Ha 4 ). 4 In a much less sympathetic review, Dorothy Everett noted how very large metrical considerations had loomed in Robinson's decisions: ". . . he has frequently adopted readings because of their greater metrical regularity, even making use for this purpose of the suspect MS. Harleian 7334. This practice will appear a dangerous one to many Chaucerians in view of the uncertainties which still exist in regard to Chaucer's metre and in view of the fact that some medieval scribes certainly 'corrected' their texts in order to produce smoother lines" ( YWES [1934]: 103-105). In a more extensive "review" published five years later, Everett focussed upon "deficiencies . . . connected with what may be called the 'linguistic' side of Mr. Robinson's work" ( MA 7 [1938]: 204-213). Thus, in her two pieces on Robinson's edition, Everett was the only reviewer to remark at length upon the two guides which, as Reinecke pointed out, seem to have loomed much the largest in Robinson's editorial decisions: "Robinson . . . had marked preconceptions about Chaucer's meter and did not view the poet's grammatical usage either as tolerant or as marked by flux" (242). As did the few others who ventured to write about Robinson's textual method at all, Everett surmised, "In the case of the Canterbury Tales . . . like the Globe editors, he has used the Ellesmere manuscript as his basis. . ." (104). Everett and others who have shared this surmise have had to read between the lines because Robinson's discussion of his textual method was very sketchy indeed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B. Robinson's Discussion of His Editorial Method In an otherwise friendly review, M. B. Ruud complained of Robinson's failure to note all of his departures from the text of Ellesmere (El) ( MLN 50 [1935]: 329-332), and in noting this criticism Reinecke attempted to put the best possible face upon the scarcity of textual notes and the guardedly brief description of textual method: He is doubtless right in sensing that Robinson's thin selection of text notes requires us to take more on faith than would be ideal beyond the undergraduate level. In this connection, however, one ought to review Robinson's own explanation of why he abandoned his original intention of publishing a full apparatus criticus (Preface, p. vii). Beyond the mere question of bulk, there was the fairly recent appearance of Root's Troilus and the expectation of Manly and Rickert's Tales . This last must have been the chief factor; every time Robinson explained his reasonings on the basis of the eight published Chaucer Society texts, the Cardigan manuscript and the Morgan, he was leaving himself open to embarrassment when the Chicago monument superseded all previous textual opinions. (235) In this Reinecke does seem to have fathomed at least a part of the reason both for the very guarded explanations which Robinson provided of his editorial method and for his "thin selection of textual notes." If this is the principal part of the explanation, however, it is hardly a defense. After all, those who use a text which claims the title of "critical edition" have the right to know the critical methods by which the editor arrived at it. Furthermore, they need enough of such evidence as alternative readings and textual notes which explain the reasoning behind the choices to be able to follow the editor's methods in their execution. We may first turn to what we may gather from what Robinson said about his achievement and methods and then proceed to what can be learned from charts comparing his choices with those of other editors. With a very minor reservation, Robinson claimed for his entire text of Chaucer's works the status of a critical edition: The entire text has been made afresh by the editor. . . . In fact the text may be called a critical edition, with one reservation. In the case of some of the more important works, including the Canterbury Tales , the manuscript materials accessible to the editor have not been exhaustive. But the best copies of all the works have been available for use as the basis of the edition, and enough others have been compared to make possible, in the editor's belief, the establishment of trustworthy texts. (xxxiii) Reinecke's comment after quoting this passage certainly seems just: This is a little disconcerting, because of the ambiguities and subtle guardedness of "due regard to critical principles," "best copies," and "enough others." It is just this paragraph that the reviewers tended to fall upon. Surely Robinson knew that when he spoke of archetypes and critical editions nearly all would take him to mean what the German textual-criticism tradition had meant for a century. (238) The passage alluded to about "archetypes" will be discussed after a look at Robinson's expansion of his one reservation about having produced a critical edition. In alluding to the forthcoming Manly-Rickert "great critical edition," Robinson showed how little he was concerned by his reservation that "the manuscript materials [of the Tales ] accessible to the editor have not been exhaustive." He initially pointed to the textual knowledge which the publication of Manly-Rickert would make available: "Their work, which is eagerly awaited by all Chaucerians, will shed new light on doubtful readings, and will probably make it possible for the first time to reconstruct the successive stages in the composition of the Canterbury Tales " (xxxiii). Yet Robinson quickly undermined the force of this and implicitly reasserted his claim to having produced something very close to definitive by his next sentence: "But it does not appear likely that a text based upon the complete collation would be materially different from one that can be constructed from the eight published manuscripts which include the best copy, the Ellesmere MS., and are so distributed as to represent all the important groups of authorities" ( Ibid. ). The remainder of the two and a half pages of introduction devoted to the text of the Tales is taken up primarily with the claims of two manuscripts, Ha 4 and El. The role of Ha 4 in Robinson's text provides important information about his editorial method. Moreover, the exact relation of El to his text lies at the heart of the question of his method. Reinecke's allusion to Robinson's speaking of "archetypes" referred to a passage less noted by reviewers than the one about presenting a "critical edition" but no less important: In textual method the present editor does not belong to the severest critical school. When the readings of the "critical text" or of a superior archetype appeared unsatisfactory or manifestly inferior, he has accepted help from other authorities more often than the strict constructionists might approve. He has seen no way of avoiding the exercise of personal judgment. But he has not practiced mere eclecticism, and in making his decisions he has endeavored to give constant attention to the relation of the manuscripts and to all relevant consideration of language, meter, and usage. (xxxiii) Probably the chief reason that this passage has drawn less comment is that Robinson clearly was not using the word "archetype" in its usual sense. In textual studies the usual meaning of "archetype" is that given by those who practice the genealogical method of Lachmann, yet, as Reinecke noted, the review of Alois Brandl "praises the editor for his introductions and explanatory notes, only to attack him severely for not having been possessed by the spirit of Lachmann and pretending to a 'critical edition' while his true basis of textual judgement was his common sense" (235). Scholars who have attempted to understand what Robinson meant by an archetype or archetypes that might contain readings superior to those in the "critical text" have quite naturally turned to the best-text method, the chief rival to the genealogical method when Robinson edited his text. In a section called "The Text (Theory)," Reinecke followed the most general surmise about Robinson's method from the first reviewers to the general editor of the "Third Edition": "Was Robinson aware of Joseph Bédier's devastating critique of the strict Stammbaum method in the Introduction to his Lai de l'ombre (1913)? This French scholar's analysis of the German method led him to adopt a procedure very similar to that which Robinson actually used for his Chaucer : choose a 'best' manuscript and edit it in the light of the others, using common sense and scholarly knowledge and experience" (239). Reinecke did not specify that El was this "best" manuscript, but because El was the only one which Robinson discussed at any length in positive terms (as opposed to Ha 4 in negative ones) and because he said that he generally followed it in "mere matters of orthography" (xxxv), Reinecke clearly took for granted that El was Robinson's base, as did others who attempted to understand his method, such as Everett. For example, in the textual introduction to the "Third Edition" of Robinson, its general editor, Larry Benson, first noted of the "over 160 changed readings" in Robinson's Second Edition, "That there were not more shows that Robinson was not convinced by Manly and Rickert's theory that the Ellesmere is an 'edited' manuscript whose scribe (or 'editor') frequently 'corrected' the meter. That theory has now been refuted by George Kane in his essay on the Manly-Rickert edition, which appears in Editing Chaucer (ed. Paul G. Ruggiers, 1985)" ( Ibid. ). Although a comparison of the discussions of El by Variorum editors such as Thomas Ross and Derek Pearsall with the critique by Kane will show how far Kane is from having refuted the theory of editing in the production of El, 5 what is important about this quotation for the present study is that in defending the text of El, the editor of the Third Edition of Robinson seemed to believe that he was defending the basis of Robinson's text. A look at Robinson's own discussion of El shows some warrant for this general belief about his having used El as his base-text but also presents (especially when taken with other comments and the charts to be discussed below) stronger grounds for thinking that Robinson had another procedure in mind. After noting that he had "no such means of testing" the variants of El "as was afforded for the Harleian manuscript by Professor Tatlock's study" and looking to the forthcoming Manly-Rickert to "show just how much scattered support such readings may have," Robinson continued, But from the evidence furnished by printed texts and the editor's collation of the Cardigan and Morgan manuscripts it does not appear that they are to be accepted without scrutiny on the bare authority of Ellesmere. That manuscript, though superior to all others, has its proportion of errors, some of which it shares with other manuscripts of the a group. It therefore cannot be regarded as an independent witness to the original text; nor do its peculiar readings look like revisions by the author. (xxxv) Particularly in its rejection of El "as an independent witness," such a description gives very little support to the notion that Robinson used El as his substantive base; however, there is perhaps a little in his closing comment upon the El accidentals: "In mere matters of orthography, when verbal variants are not involved, the Ellesmere copy has been followed, as representing a good scribal tradition. But throughout all Chaucer's works . . . the spellings of the manuscripts have been corrected for grammatical accuracy and for the adjustment of rimes" ( Ibid. ). Although Robinson's discussion of El might arguably offer a little support to the very widespread assumption that he used El as base, his rejection of it as an independent witness and his discussion of such matters as "a superior archetype" seem to argue otherwise, as does the evidence of charts to be discussed below. The key to Robinson's conscious editorial method seems to be in just what he meant by the phrases "the 'critical text'" and "a superior archetype." The usual meaning of "critical text" is that which an editor aims to construct on the basis of extant or reconstructed documents thought to be the most authoritative (though subject to emendation). In the absence of the copy from which extant ones derive, the usual meaning of "archetype" is that which a textual critic aims to reconstruct by his studies of descendant copies. Since there is nothing in his discussions nor in such analyses as that of Reinecke to indicate that Robinson himself attempted such a task as reconstructing an archetype and since he seems to refer to a "critical text" apart from his own, the question must arise of where Robinson turned to find "the 'critical text' or a superior archetype" whose readings at times "appeared unsatisfactory or manifestly inferior." Whatever Robinson may have meant by putting the article "a" before "superior archetype" (seemingly allowing for the possible existence of multiple 'superior archetypes,' perhaps of the so-called 'Type A' and 'Type B' manuscripts), the remainder of his discussion seems to hint that he believed he found something like one of them in the agreements of what he called the "A type of manuscripts": In the Canterbury Tales . . . the A type of manuscripts, represented by Ellesmere, Hengwrt, Cambridge Dd, and Cambridge Gg—whether or not they all go back to a single archetype below the original—is generally accepted as of superior authority to the B type, which includes Harleian 7334, Corpus, Petworth, and Lansdowne. They are the basis of the present text, as of all recent editions. In the Pardoner's Tale , for which nearly all the authorities have been printed and compared, there seems to be no case where the reading of the more numerous manuscripts of type B is preferable. But elsewhere in the tales there are a few passages where the B readings seem to the editor superior to the A readings, and he has not hesitated to adopt them. (xxxv) Any resort to Manly-Rickert or to the Variorum discussions will show how various are the manuscript traditions lumped together in the two categories of "Type A and Type B," particularly the former. 6 In the event this is hardly surprising: one of Bédier's most trenchant challenges to the genealogical method was that far more often than credible it resulted in bifid stemmata, and Manly-Rickert's much more rigorous than usual application of the method showed how thoroughly misplaced had been earlier analyses which had resulted in a bifid stemma for the manuscripts of the Tales . 7 Because the Manly-Rickert data and analyses so thoroughly disproved the earlier bifid stemma of the 'A type-B type' sort and because Robinson's second edition appeared seventeen years after Manly-Rickert, we might have expected a revision of this description of method and of the method itself; however, in the Preface Robinson showed the opposite of an awareness of any conflict: . . . since I have seen no reason for changing my general method of dealing with orthography, grammatical rectification, and such matters, often not to be settled simply by comparison of manuscripts, I am republishing, practically without change, the introductory chapter on the text. Fortunately, although I had only some dozen more or less complete authorities to work with, the manuscripts provided by the Chaucer Society had been so well selected from different groups that they made possible when supplemented by textual studies then available, the application of critical method. (vii) Such an apparent unawareness of the degree to which the Manly-Rickert data and analyses had shown the opposition of the full manuscript evidence to the earlier bipartite grouping reinforces the point made by Reinecke about Robinson's neglect of manuscript relations: "Robinson's emphasis on 'the relation of the manuscripts' often in application seems secondary" (240). Reinecke illustrated the point with reference to the role of Ha 4 in the text. Well over half of Robinson's textual introduction was devoted to a discussion of the defects in Ha 4 with the following explanation: Some editors, among them Professor Skeat and Mr. Pollard, have held it to contain Chaucerian revisions, and they have consequently felt free to draw upon any of its readings that seem intrinsically attractive. Other scholars have doubted the special authority of the manuscript, and, in the opinion of the present editor, it has been virtually disproved by Professor Tatlock in his study on the subject. (xxxiv) In illustration of Robinson's neglect of manuscript relations, Reinecke pointed to the way he nevertheless "tended to cling to this manuscript [Ha 4 ]," including at times accepting some of its unique readings. Because he focussed, as others have done, upon the relations of Robinson's text to various manuscripts, Reinecke had no way of recognizing the full import of Robinson's neglect of 'the relation of the manuscripts" (240) nor of the source of his Ha 4 readings. In the next section, charts showing the relations of Robinson's emendations to those of earlier printed editions will help to clarify the matter. Because of the critical mysteries in Robinson's description of his method, because he was editing in the heyday of the best-text method, and because he joined earlier editors in calling El "superior to all others" (xxxv), it is small wonder that, from the first reviewers to the editor of the Third Edition, many have thought that Robinson meant that he had used El as something like a base text. After much study and correspondence with others, George Reinecke gave this description of Robinson's method: "It is therefore best to define Robinson's text as conservative, highly informed, and eclectic, though arrived at after much of the procedure for establishing a critical text had been performed. He was careful about his choice of copy text; he rarely accepted unique readings. When he did depart from his copy, it was usually for a reading connected either with grammar or with metrics (241). Reinecke and others who have understood Robinson's editorial method in this way have taken for granted that for the text of the Canterbury Tales Robinson used El as his base text or base copy (depending upon what Reinecke means by "copy text"). Also, Reinecke spoke for many in approving Robinson's "utilization of only ten manuscripts" as "a sensible decision": ". . . this number included all the manuscripts commonly termed 'good,' and going further would mean competing with Manly and Rickert, though it promised ever-diminishing textual returns" ( Ibid. ). The problem with this is that it neglects the manuscript relations discovered by Manly and Rickert as completely as Robinson did in his second edition. Furthermore, there is evidence that the text which Robinson emended was not that of a manuscript at all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">C. Robinson's Emendations With the reservation that the text which Robinson emended is very much in question, what Reinecke says of Robinson's editing of the minor poems can also be applied to the Canterbury Tales : "When he did depart from his copy, it was usually for a reading connected either with grammar or with metrics" (241). What Reinecke says of Robinson's general neglect of the Manly-Rickert analyses in his second edition applies to the neglect of manuscripts and studies in the first: "His chief preoccupation was the printing of regularly scanned, craftsmanlike, artistically significant lines conforming to his already determined opinions about Chaucer's grammar and meter" (250). As mentioned, a good part of the reason that Reinecke and others have been puzzled about Robinson's method of editing has been because they focussed upon the manuscripts containing the readings he chose. Two charts to follow will show how the relations of the Robinson text to the texts of earlier editions are much more illuminating than such manuscript relations, including the supposed basic one with El. Skeat's text (SK) was widely regarded as standard throughout the years Robinson was editing, and Manly's edition (ML) appeared in 1928, five years before the first edition of Robinson and four years after Manly and Rickert had begun to gather and analyze all of the manuscripts. Manly chose El as base for his 1928 text in keeping with the general belief in its superiority (this belief, shared by Rickert, who also helped with the 1928 text, steadily eroded as their collations and analyses progressed). The first chart presents an analysis of the relations of the Skeat, Manly and Robinson 1 editions in three tales which they share: Chart No. 1. Relations of the Skeat, Manly and Robinson i Editions General Prologue Nun's Priest Prioress All SK-ML-RB1 together 72 44 24 140 ML-RB1 (—SK) 27 15 2 44 SK-RB1 (-ML) 27 25 9 61 SK-ML (—RB1) 3 5 2 10 Totals 129 89 37 255 Unlike the much fuller charts upon which are based those in the present study (and for which there is no space), this study's charts list Robinson's editorial choices with those of other editors of the Tales only under the three categories of "El," "Hg," and "Others" for the following reason: with the exception of revisions of earlier texts based upon Ha 4 , since the publication in the mid-nineteenth century of the Six-Text Edition with transcriptions of the El and Hg texts first and second in the perceived order of their quality, the basic questions for most modern editors have been (1) which of the two to choose as having the best text, (2) when to emend the chosen base (usually El), and (3) whether to choose for such emendations the reading in the other manuscript of the pair (Hg or El) or in some other manuscript. 8 The first point to be made about the chart above is that the editors' agreement that El has the best text is not the only reason that the readings of the three editions coincide in 129 of 255 cases. In the General Prologue , for example, the three editions agree in preferring the reading of Hg to that of El 13 of 72 times and in preferring the reading of other manuscripts 7 times. In the Prioress's Tale , the three editors chose the Hg reading over one in El 4 times and a reading different from either 6 of 24 times. Then, in the Nun's Priest's Tale occurs the most dramatic agreement of all: in only 19 of 44 times of manuscript conflict did the three editors choose the El reading over Hg and others; 17 times they chose the Hg reading, 5 times they chose from other manuscripts, and 3 times they chose a shared El-Hg reading where other modern editors have chosen one from other manuscripts. Sheer probability quickly rules out coincidence in such cases because the agreements in readings other than those of the base-text are too regular to admit of coincidence: rather than simple decisions to emend the base-text reading in a particular locus, in all but a very few cases under the category "Others," they are decisions to emend it in exactly the same way . Most of the times when Manly and Robinson chose differently than Skeat, they chose a reading shared by Hg and El where he had chosen a reading from another manuscript, most often from Ha 4 . Because he had started with a copy of El as base-text, Manly's decisions to emend were much more independent of Skeat's text than were those of Robinson: Manly chose differently from Skeat in 105 of 255 cases, 41%, whereas Robinson's text differed in 54 cases, 21.2%. When we remember the sequence of Skeat-Manly-Robinson, an even more striking fact emerges: in 44 of those 54 cases where he differed with Skeat, Robinson chose as Manly had done. In other words, in only 10 cases, 3.9% of the 255, does the Robinson text differ from the texts of both Skeat and Manly. The next chart involves three tales either entirely absent from Manly's edition or else, in the case of the Miller's performance, limited to a few lines carefully selected for his high-school readers; however, the Globe edition came out in 1898, four year's after Skeat's Oxford one, and contains them complete: Chart No. 2. Relations of the Skeat, Globe and Robinson i Editions Miller Physician Manciple All SK-GL-RB1 together 76 21 36 133 GL-RB1 (—SK) 10 8 8 26 SK-RB1 (—GL) 21 2 6 29 SK-GL (—RB1) 10 5 5 20 All separate 1 0 0 1 Totals 118 36 55 209 As did Manly later on, the Globe editor, A. W. Pollard, began with a copy of El; however, he was more like Robinson in being influenced by Skeat: of 209 variants involved, the Globe text differs from Skeat's 55 times and Robinson's text does so 46. Robinson was not quite as influenced by Pollard's decisions as he had been by Manly's; still, 26 of his 46 emendations in opposition to Skeat agree with Globe readings. Once again underlining the smallness of Robinson's allegiance to what others have taken to be his base is the fact that of the 20 readings which differ from both earlier editions, 12 also differ from the text of El. In his editing Skeat demonstrated the eclecticism which characterized the nineteenth-century editing, even of a text with one manuscript deemed much superior, by choosing readings away from El more often than did later editors; yet in the Miller's Prologue and Tale , Robinson's text is away from El only one time fewer than is Skeat's, 50 to 51. Of 117 variants, the three editions are together 76 times; then, Robinson's joins Skeat's minus the Globe in 21 others and joins the Globe apart from Skeat's in 10 others, leaving only 10 instances where Robinson chose apart from these two editions preceding his. Striking evidence that he was not departing from either or both by a preference for the text of El are the two facts that (1) in 20 of the 21 cases where Robinson joined Skeat and parted from the Globe edition, the latter has the El reading whereas Skeat and Robinson have that of Hg, and (2) in 7 of the 10 instances when he differed from Skeat and the Globe, they chose the El reading and he the Hg. All editors tend strongly to prefer the text of Hg in the Physician's Prologue and Tale , but the Globe editor, Pollard, still managed to remain a little closer to El than either Skeat or especially Robinson, preferring Hg readings by only an 11 to 8 ratio compared with Skeat's 12 to 8 and Robinson's 15 to 4. Of 36 variants, Robinson's text is with the other two 21 times, with Globe apart from Skeat 8 times, and with Skeat apart from Globe 2 times, leaving 5 times when his first edition differs from both: twice he chose with Hg when they chose El, once with other manuscripts when they chose the shared Hg-El reading, and twice with Hg-El when they chose readings from other manuscripts. With the exceptions of the texts of Manly-Rickert and of Pratt, modern editors have tended by a slight margin to prefer the text of El in the Manciple's Prologue and Tale to that of Hg. Even so, the Globe ratio is closer to El than those of Skeat and Robinson: 18 to 9 vs. 18 to 15 and 18 to 16 respectively. Of 55 variants, Robinson is with both others 36 times, with Globe apart from Skeat 8 times, and with Skeat apart from Globe 6 times, leaving five times apart from both. The comparison here once again shows Pollard's closer relation to the text of El and Robinson's very indifferent one: in the 6 cases when Globe is apart from the other two, it is with El against Hg in 5 and with the shared Hg-El reading once when Skeat and Robinson choose a reading from other manuscripts; on the other hand, in the 5 cases where Robinson is apart from the other two, he has the Hg reading twice, a reading from other manuscripts twice, and only once has the shared Hg-El reading when Skeat and Pollard have a reading from other manuscripts. Such close correspondences with earlier editions in choosing apart from the text of El raise particular questions about the general belief that Robinson began with El as his base, particularly given the contrast between his text's lack of great preference for El readings and the very different performances of other modern editors who clearly stated that they did use El as base, Manly, Pollard and Fisher. 9 As we have seen, Robinson's introduction is not really clear about his use of El, though he calls it the best text. Still, he does claim to have given an important role in his editing to the Chaucer Society transcriptions and to subsequent studies of the manuscripts; furthermore, those claims not only have been generally accepted but now have been greatly reinforced by the publication of Robinson's text of the Tales with very few emendations as part of the Third Edition. As we have just seen, however, the relations of Robinson's first edition with those immediately preceding prove much more illuminating about his procedures than those with the manuscripts, including El. A last chart comparing the major editions of the Tales will show something of their relations to the manuscripts and to each other: Chart No. 3.

Third, the unavowed relation of Robinson's editions to Skeat seems manifest in the figures for El-Hg-Other: Skeat 181-152-109, Robinson 1 179-157-66, and Robinson 2 173-162-66 (the disparities in the totals stem from shared El-Hg readings accepted by one or the other, usually by Robinson). And finally, when the General Prologue is omitted from the list, the trend begun in Skeat's edition of favoring Hg readings as much as those from El becomes even clearer: Skeat 131-114 El-Hg, Robinson 1 124-123, Manly-Rickert 64-183, Robinson 2 120-126, Pratt 85-161, Fisher 150-98, and Riverside 119-128. 11 One last comparison of the first Robinson edition with an earlier printed text should put to rest any lingering doubts about his primary reliance upon earlier editions and not upon manuscript evidence. The data in Charts 1 and 2 left 30 instances when Robinson 1 was apart from all three of the editions which immediately preceded his, 10 apart from Skeat and Manly and 20 apart from Skeat and Globe. Following the affiliations of Robinson 1 with Trywhitt's edition of 1775 (the best one to appear before Skeat's) accounts for most of the 30: 26 of the 30 times when Robinson 1 differs from the three editions immediately preceding it, it agrees with the reading in Tyrwhitt. Although Tyrwhitt did not have access to Hg, he used as his base an earlier printed text with readings going back to manuscripts related to Hg, so that, given his use of the other editions, the seeming Robinson choices of Hg which differ from immediately preceding editions over the seven other manuscripts of the Chaucer Society transcriptions very possibly owe much to like readings in Tyrwhitt: 16 of the 26 times when Robinson 1 coincides with Tyrwhitt apart from the other editors, the reading is that of Hg in preference to those of the other seven Chaucer Society manuscripts, and 5 times is the shared Hg-E1 reading in place of a reading of the other six. Tyrwhitt listed Dd as a manuscript of "most credit," 12 and a Dd reading accounts for 3 of the 5 remaining times when Robinson 1 is with his edition. Although he accepted the general consensus about Robinson's use of El as base, Reinecke had several insights which anticipated the conclusions of the present study. One of the most illuminating is his discussion of why "the spellings in [Robinson's] Glossary do not always match those in the text": My own observation is that the glossarial entries do sometimes match Skeat's. It is a fair guess that Skeat was utilized as a sort of secondary copy text during the early stages of work on RB1 and that his spellings thus crept into the Glossary. (248) Here and elsewhere, either "base copy" or "base text" (depending upon exactly how he envisioned the process) would have been preferable to Reinecke's "copy text"; however, his discovery is illuminating and fits with what the charts and other data strongly suggest was Robinson's actual way of editing. Two decisions by Robinson to differ from Skeat's practice shed a great deal of light upon his use of Skeat's Glossary: he decided systematically to respell the Canterbury Tales following El practice, and he decided to put the Tales at the beginning of his edition. Thus, some of the words in Skeat's Glossary are spelled differently from their first occurrence in the Canterbury Tales because earlier works in Skeat such as Troilus and Criseyde had different spellings. Differences in spelling between the first Tales occurrence in Robinson's text and in his glossary can have no such explanation, however, because he put the Tales first and because he changed the spellings to those of El. Skeat Skeat Robinson Robinson Line Glossary Text Glossary Text A 41 aray array aray array A 2046 arayed arrayed arayen arrayed I 567 areise areysen areisen areysen A 2602 arest arest arest arrest B 4090 areste areste arest areest I 580 aretten arretteth aretten arrette Because he was glossing generally and not by first occurrence, Robinson added an 'n' for the infinitive to the verbs, and he removed the 'e' from the second "areste"; otherwise, however, he left the spelling as it occurred in Skeat's glossary—despite having respelled in the text to fit El practice. A striking example of his practice in this regard is the word "bisinesse." Both Skeat's and Robinson's glossaries spell the word "bisinesse" in the same way, and Skeat's glossary cites the first occurrence of his first definition at B 1415 of the Tales . Although Skeat has the same spelling there and in the other 31 Tales occurrences as in his glossary, Robinson spells it "bisynesse" all 32 times. This systematic spelling of the word in Robinson's text is in keeping with his claim to have followed El "in mere matters of orthography" (xxxv) in the Tales . Still, Robinson did not regularize the spelling of other texts, so that the various texts exhibit a total of 7 ways of spelling "bisinesse" (e.g., "bysynes") in the total of 61 occurrences of the word in the Tales and elsewhere; however, only one matches the glossary spelling ("Fortune," 75). Such an identity of spellings with those in Skeat's glossary and such differences between Robinson's own text and glossary suggest that Robinson's use of Skeat's glossary was akin to his use of Skeat's text of the Tales . Putting the two glossaries side by side should convince anyone of the great debt which Robinson's glossary owes to Skeat in definitions as well as in spellings. Because Skeat attempted to cite the first occurrence of a difference in meaning of each word and because Robinson listed rather the most usual meanings of a word, Skeat's is a much fuller glossary. Still, the likenesses in definition are quite regular. For example, Skeat glossed the word "thakketh" as "strokes, pats"; glossing generally and not by first occurrence, Robinson changed to the infinitive "thakken" but kept the gloss "stroke, pat." That they were not sharing the same source in this seems clear in turning to the likely alternatives. Bosworth-Toller glosses Old English "þaccian" "I. to pat, clap, strike gently, with the open hand or the like," and the O.E.D. glosses "thack" "1. trans . To clap with the open hand or the like; to pat, slap lightly." 13 While all agree on the definition "pat," the agreement of Skeat and Robinson in "stroke" is striking because this seems a different action from such as "strike gently" and "slap lightly." This and other evidence strongly suggests that, rather than beginning fresh with either, Robinson used as bases for emendation both Skeat's text and his glossary. 14 In constituting his text, it is clear that Robinson did look at the Chaucer Society transcripts from time to time, just as he implied. But, just as the earlier charts made it clear that Robinson did not start, as Pollard and as Manly had done, with a transcription of El as base, it seems equally clear that he did not systematically collate the published transcripts of the eight Chaucer Society manuscripts or he would have been much clearer about the relations of the El, of the Hg, and especially of the Ha 4 readings to his emendation decisions (compare Tatlock's point that Robinson showed "little awareness of the inaccuracy in minor details of the Chaucer Society's printed editions of the manuscripts"). Similarly, Robinson could hardly have studied the Manly-Rickert data and analyses very deeply for his second edition: (1) as noted, his reprinting the textual introduction of his first edition virtually intact showed that Robinson misunderstood how completely Manly-Rickert had exploded the earlier bipartite analysis of manuscript relations accepted there; (2) his reprinting of readings with little or no support beyond a single manuscript, as in the continuance of unique readings from El and even from Ha 4 , showed a lack of systematic collation akin to his practice earlier with the Chaucer Society transcripts; and (3) the smallness of the number of Robinson's emendations of his earlier text, the fact that much the greater portion of them were from Hg, and his apparent unawareness of how his decisions were continuing a trend begun by Skeat of moving from the text of El toward that of Hg all demonstrate how little attention he paid in his emendations to the manuscripts and their relations as revealed in Manly-Rickert. With regard to the last, Reinecke showed the surprise of one who assumes "Robinson's dedication to Ellesmere" when he noted of the second edition, ". . . fully two-thirds of the new readings (excluding those not manuscript-related) follow Hengwrt" (250). Thus, various ways of comparing Robinson's editions with manuscripts and with other editions all agree in the same conclusion: the evident relationship of his glossary definitions and spellings to those of Skeat, the lack of regular, consciously derived nearness in text of either Robinson edition to a manuscript, and the neglect in both editions of manuscript relations all conjoin with the greater closeness of Robinson's text to that of Skeat in substantive emendations to argue very strongly that for much the greater part of the time that Robinson worked upon his first edition of the Canterbury Tales , the de facto physical base upon which he made his changes in substantives and accidentals was Skeat's printed text. When we remember how Robinson's misunderstanding of the Manly-Rickert data and analyses in his second edition fits evidence in the first of his lack of interest in the manuscripts and their relations, and when we also remember that he spent the greater part of his career in working upon his edition of Chaucer, we can see how Skeat's edition could play such a large role in Robinson's own edition. In the first third of the century, anyone interested in questions about the text of the Canterbury Tales would have been engaged in something like an informal version of the process of comparing Skeat's text with other information because his was much the most used in classroom and in study; thus, a man such as Robinson spending twenty-nine years in his editing (Reinecke 231), all the time teaching from Skeat's text, could hardly have avoided such a procedure. Pollard himself had a high reputation as an editor at the time, so it would have been natural for Robinson to compare the readings of the Globe text with those of Skeat. Also, Robinson would have been aware of Lounsbury's praise of Tyrwhitt as an editor of the Tales : "No more thorough and conscientious editing had ever before been applied to the elucidation of a great English classic." 15 And finally, as he mentioned in his introduction, Robinson was aware that Manly (and Rickert) had been studying all of the manuscripts in the years just before the publication of Manly's own edition of 1928. These facts and the data in the preceding charts seem to show that, while Robinson pointed in his introduction to manuscripts and to textual studies and while he tried to take them into account (particularly the division of the manuscripts between "type A" and "type B"), his heaviest and most regular reliance must rather have been not upon manuscripts and manuscript studies but upon the printed texts which were the result of previous editors' studies of the manuscripts. His actual editorial practices and certain hints in his textual introduction seem to show that Robinson followed this procedure because he believed that among them previous editors had reconstructed something very close to the 'A archetype' in their editions, thus pointing to their collective results as the "critical edition" to which he alluded as well as the primary sources of his information about a "superior archetype" (with the Chaucer Society transcriptions of such manuscripts as Lansdowne and Petworth representing the 'B archetype'). Such a belief, together with the fact that Skeat's edition was universally accepted as standard throughout the twenty-nine years that Robinson worked on his own edition, help to explain his very heavy reliance upon that edition. Thus, whatever Robinson consciously meant in his textual introduction about his responses "when the readings of the 'critical text' or of a superior archetype appeared unsatisfactory or manifestly inferior," his actual way of editing seems to have been (1) to begin with Skeat's text, (2) to compare its readings with those of other editions, particularly those published since Skeat, (3) then to compare alternative readings of the published transcriptions of Chaucer Society "Type A" manuscripts with those of "Type B," and (4) to favor a reading from one of the A group (especially one in El or Hg) over a B reading which other editors had chosen (usually from Ha 4 or Cp) only when it could be reconciled with his own ideas about Chaucer's meter and grammar. Since the earlier editors had shared less rigid forms of the same ideas, Robinson could almost always find support from their own decisions in such matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D. Flaws in Robinson's Editorial Method and Why They Matter Because for more than fifty years Robinson's text has been Chaucer's text for almost everyone, resistance to the idea that it is basically flawed is inevitable. While one reader of an earlier version of this study pointed out that Robinson's editions "have presented a sanitized, smoothened Chaucer to too many generations of students and scholars," two others spoke for what will likely be a majority in their doubts that any material gains would be made if Chaucer's text were edited in a different way. I have only the space to respond to such doubts by the description of method given above and by a brief discussion of why an alternative is preferable. Fortunately, however, ample materials are available now, as they were not in 1933, to anyone who honestly wishes to resolve the question for himself. In closing I shall briefly address the question of a preferable method. In response to my conclusion that Robinson's text "indicates a heavy dependence upon earlier editions," a critic might ask, "Why necessarily bad?" If the editors of those editions had been in full possession of the relevant manuscript evidence, if those editors had been primarily responsive to that evidence rather than to earlier editions, if further the editor who used those earlier editions had taken both the manuscript evidence and the editions fully into account, and if finally that editor had given a full and accurate account of his procedure, then that way of editing might at least be arguable. I believe that I have presented enough evidence that such was not the case with Robinson's edition, but I would argue that such a procedure is not desirable in any case. In the first place, the editors who published before Manly-Rickert possessed only a fraction of the manuscript evidence. Furthermore, they worked with a reading of the manuscript evidence which any resort to Manly-Rickert or to one of the Variorum fascicles will show was badly flawed. And finally, those editors were influenced by much faultier editions published earlier which further vitiated their work. Skeat very eloquently conveys the shock of learning how the editors before him had done their work: All who have been accustomed to former (complete) editions have necessarily accepted numberless theories as to the scansion of lines which they will, in course of due time, be prepared to abandon. In the course of my work, it has been made clear to me that Chaucer's text has been manipulated and sophisticated, frequently in most cunning and plausible ways, to a far greater extent than I could have believed to be possible. (xvi) The accretion of such changes is, after all, a version of what happened in the descent of the manuscripts themselves: not only did scribes inevitably make inadvertent errors in copying, but their suspicions that such errors existed in their exemplars led some of them to make deliberate changes of just the kinds made by later editors with similar suspicions, the changes accumulating through the years so as to move the text progressively away from what Chaucer wrote. While editors of the Tales such as Robinson who have based their editions upon earlier ones have removed some of the accretions to Chaucer's text of earlier editions, they have brought forward many others, as in Robinson's acceptance of very questionable Ha 4 readings adopted by Skeat. Furthermore, when, as with Robinson, they have worked not inductively from the manuscript evidence but deductively from such grounds as rigid notions about grammar and meter, then they have necessarily added their own accretions to the 'cloak' of editorial changes which Chaucer's text wears. Thus, this way of editing by primary resort to earlier editions performs in a way effectively the opposite of the genealogical method which strives to work back through the layers of change to the archetype. The principal reason for an initial attempt to work out the relations of the manuscripts is that by doing so an editor can have objective help in detecting and removing the changes to which an author's text has been subjected since he wrote it. By choosing among earlier editorial choices of readings with little regard for their bases in the manuscripts and their relationships, Robinson piled his own particular set of choices upon those made by earlier editors, in their turn based upon others, often in a chain all the way back to the earliest editions. 16 If nothing else, an editor who begins with the testimony of fifteenth-century manuscripts will have to deal with the accretion of only a few decades of changes in Chaucer's text rather than five centuries of them. One very important reason that the editor's starting-point usually has such great influence upon his decisions and thus upon his completed text is simply the influence of use. A look at the hold which the very erratic Ha 4 text had upon the nineteenth-century understanding of the text should be cautionary for all: as the basis of the printed texts which scholars learned from, taught from, and cited in their studies, that manuscript and its readings gained so much credibility from sheer use that some of them labored long and hard after the appearance of the Six-Text Edition to explain the vagaries of Ha 4 (in clear opposition to the testimony of the six) as revisions by Chaucer himself. Robinson's text has been a like case for this century, with the added confusion that the supposed basis of his text in El has not been as most have thought: this belief has led some to argue for El's superiority without reference to the evidence in Manly-Rickert and in the Variorum fascicles that the text of El was carefully changed in its making in much the way a modern editor might do, and despite the evidence of collation that in the great majority of cases of conflict the evidence of independent lines of manuscript descent favors the Hg reading. Thus, the latest edition of Chaucer, the Riverside or "Third Edition" of Robinson's text, follows and perpetuates a very unfortunate example. The first flaw in Robinson's way of editing is that it neglected the all-important first step of inductively examining the manuscript evidence. Rather, Robinson's first steps were deductive and based upon untenable assumptions: that the manuscripts are related by a bifid stemma, that among them Skeat and other early editions adequately represented the better branch of that stemma ("type A"), and that Robinson possessed virtually unerring guides in his ideas about Chaucer's grammar and meter. Also, Robinson's primary resort to editions rather than to manuscripts caused patterns in his choices which were at odds with his own theories: Ha 4 readings adopted by Skeat persist in Robinson's text despite his acceptance of Tatlock's critique of its testimony; also, because his primary points of reference were the editions, he failed to note how his textual decisions continued the movement from El to Hg readings begun by Skeat, despite the assertion of both editors that El was clearly the superior (a matter to be developed in a separate study). Because manuscript testimony had only secondary importance for Robinson, and because he believed that his very neat and rigid ideas about Chaucer's meter and grammar fully matched Chaucer's own throughout the fifteen or more years that Chaucer worked on the Tales , those ideas served as much more constant guides for his decisions than the manuscript testimony. Space is too limited to demonstrate the effects of Robinson's imposition of these ideas upon the text, but materials are readily available for anyone to make the comparison: for reading an 'unsanitized, unsmoothened' Canterbury Tales , the First Fascicle of the Variorum Chancer 17 presents a facsimile and transcription of the Hg text with marginal collation of El, so that anyone with a copy of Robinson's text can compare it with one copied by a scribe who consciously changed nothing (Hg) as well as with one copied by a careful scribe given to a certain amount of "smoothing" of the meter and occasionally to coming up with a 'better' word (El). Alternatively, those who wish to compare Robinson's way of editing with that of other editors and with the available manuscript evidence may turn to the other Variorum fascicles of tales which have been published to date (with collations below the text). In either case, because of the influence of the texts of El and especially of Robinson, the reader's initial tendency may be to lean toward the 'smoothened' version. Before long, however, a preference should emerge for the more lively verse, freed from five centuries' encasement in editorial decisions and supported by the best manuscript evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * As are other Chaucerians of the twentieth century, I am deeply indebted to F. N. Robinson's editions, especially their introductions and notes. If the present study seems poor recompense for that debt, I can only plead a greater debt to Chaucer's text, and I would hope that Professor Robinson would have agreed that the greater obligation of each scholar is to insure that modern editions, insofar as present knowledge permits, present the closest possible versions of what Chaucer originally wrote. I am also indebted to Fredson Bowers and his readers for helping me to clarify my purpose and to spell out matters which I too often took for granted.

Ruggiers, and the Associate Editor, Donald C. Baker. In earlier years my knowledge steadily grew as I corresponded with other editors, including Thomas Ross, editor of the Miller's Tale fascicle.

      <field name="heading_text">Chaucer's Revision of Troilus and Criseyde by Kevin K. Cureton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The theory, once axiomatic, that the manuscripts of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde preserve revision states of the text has been brought into question in recent years. In his new edition of the poem, 1 Barry Windeatt dismisses the view of the text developed by William McCormick and Robert Root. In Root's formulation, the bewildering manuscript relationships, which had proved impossible to classify in a fashion suitable for editing by recension, would be explained by recourse to the hypothesis of a single manuscript, a fair copy of the first draft in Chaucer's possession, successively corrected and revised by the poet. 2 Early copies made from this manuscript would preserve the unrevised form of the poem, what McCormick and Root called the alpha text; copies made after Chaucer had performed some or all of his revisions would preserve beta or gamma texts. McCormick, who made the original classifications, held that beta represented the intermediate and gamma the final forms of the text. In Root's hypothesis the beta manuscripts would derive from the authorial copy in its finally revised form and the gamma manuscripts from a single copy made from Chaucer's working text at a time when most but not all of his revisions had been incorporated. His hypothesis not only provided Root with the means to explain the genesis of three authentic, authorial versions of the poem; it would also account for the confusion of agreements between unrelated manuscripts and the shifting of individual manuscript affiliation from one textual tradition to another, without recourse to coincident variation and contamination. All could be explained by the confusing Chaucerian exemplar, with its additions and cancellations. Root's account of the textual tradition of the Troilus has not met with complete acceptance. In particular, the privileged status he accords the beta variants has largely been repudiated, and most subsequent scholars have preferred to edit and cite from gamma texts. 3 But the evidence for the earlier, unrevised form of the poem had until recently gone unchallenged. In discussing the text, Windeatt minimizes the importance of the alpha variants, treating the vast majority of them as scribal in origin and the rest as chance preservations of alternative readings present in Chaucer's draft. Windeatt goes to great lengths to demonstrate that certain passages absent from or added later to various alpha manuscripts—Troilus's Hymn to Love in Book 3 (1744-71), his predestination soliloquy in Book 4 (953-1085), and his ascent to the spheres in Book 5 (1807-27)—are not the evidence for revision Root claimed them to be but are, from context, an integral part of Chaucer's original conception of the poem. 4 Indeed, Windeatt's discussion of these passages is central to his attack on Root's theory of revision, and his conclusions are accepted without further demonstration in Ralph Hanna's highly critical evaluation of Root's textual work. 5 Hanna goes far beyond Windeatt in attacking Root's conception of the poem as inherently flawed. In his view, Root's depreciation of the extent of scribal responsibility for variation allowed him to recognize all variation as possibly authorial, and his selective analysis in The Textual Tradition of Chaucer's Troilus provided him with what he sought, a means of identifying authorial readings "scientifically" and so of generating a text free of editorial interference. Many of the criticisms levelled by Windeatt and Hanna are well-founded. Certainly coincident variation and contamination play a larger role than Root would allow, and his fanciful hypothesis explaining the confusion of manuscript relationships is more convenient than credible. Much of his enthusiasm for detailing revision states rather than identifying and eliminating scribal error may be explained by the fact that his was the first full account of the new textual theory to be published. 6 But if Root's enthusiasm for revision went too far in one direction, the skepticism of Windeatt and Hanna goes too far in the other, and there is a real danger that a new orthodoxy will simply replace the old. Since the appearance of Windeatt's edition most writers who mention the question of revision in the Troilus seem to regard Windeatt's as the final word, and only Charles Owen has come to the defense of Root's theories. 7 In the new Riverside Chaucer, Windeatt and Hanna are said to have "persuasively undermined Root's argument," 8 and if this new edition of the Robinson text has anything like the influence of its predecessors, this is the sum total of what many future Chaucerians will come to know and believe about the textual tradition of the Troilus . With this much at stake, a more thorough reexamination of the textual situation is clearly warranted. The three extended passages mentioned previously, those which Root took to be late additions to the text, have been discussed more extensively by textual critics than any other part of the poem, and because Windeatt's reinterpretation of this evidence underlies his rejection of revision, these passages may serve as a convenient starting point. Troilus's Hymn to Love in Book 3 (1744-71), adapted from Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy Book 2, metrum 8, was originally omitted from Ph and H2, two of the four manuscripts attesting alpha for this part of the poem, 9 although the scribe of Ph has supplied the passage on an inset leaf. The other alpha manuscripts, Gg and H5, give the song in its normal position. As Root comments, the omission in PhH2 might seem to have been accidental, particularly since these manuscripts are related genetically by a long series of common errors and so in agreement have the authority of only a single witness. 10 But there is nothing about the passage that might have led a scribe to omit it; the opening and closing lines of the song contain no verbal similarities to the textual environment that could induce an eyeskip error, and the passage is too short for its omission to have been caused by the loss of a leaf in an antecedent copy. Nothing about its subject matter would seem likely to provoke a scribe to suppress it. There is evidence, moreover, to support the view that Chaucer's composition of the song may have been independent of his writing of the narrative here. Throughout the latter part of Book 3 (1310ff) Chaucer has been following Filostrato 3, but the song Boccaccio gives his Troiolo had already been used by Chaucer in the Proem to Book 3. In its place Chaucer supplies a different song adapted from the Boethian meter generally taken to have been the source of Boccaccio's inspiration. It is not inherently unlikely that such passages as Chaucer added to the narrative of Boccaccio were composed separately, especially when, as here, the textual evidence suggests independent composition. This much Windeatt will concede: "What may survive at this point is a randomly preserved trace of the process of Ch's composition of the poem. . . . Such an expansion perhaps existed originally in the form of a physical addition to the draft which has been confused by certain scribes" (p. 38). Windeatt thus agrees with Root concerning the separate composition of the Hymn; he takes issue only with Root's theory that the poem circulated in an early version without the passage. Chaucer always intended to include a song here, he says, for "the context is, and must always have been, utter nonsense without it" (p. 38). To be sure, the context is better served by the inclusion of the song, but its omission does not make "utter nonsense" of the passage: And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take This Pandarus, and in-to gardyn lede, And swich a feste and swich a proces make Hym of Criseyde, and of hire wommanhede, And of hire beaute, that, with-outen drede It was an heuene his wordes forto here; And thanne he wolde synge in this manere. In alle nedes, for the townes werre, He was, and ay, the first in armes dyght. . . . (3.1737-1743, 1772-1773) It is at least possible to take "this manere" to refer to the "wordes" Troilus exchanges with Pandarus about Criseyde and her beauty and womanhood (Owen, p. 158, makes a similar point). Certainly Chaucer does not introduce the song with words as unambiguous as those of Boccaccio, who says that Troiolo sang "qual qui sanz'alcun mezzo si divisa" (3.73,8). 11 It is also instructive to compare Chaucer's handling of the other songs and letters whose words he reports. Troilus's first song, a lament adapted from Petrarch's Sonnet 132, is introduced by the comment that "who-so list it here, / Loo, next this vers he may it fynden here" (1.398-399). The song of Antigone is followed by the line "And of hir song right with that word she stente" (2.876). Troilus "gan synge as ʒe may heere" (5.637) his third and final song. And in their letters to one another in Book 5, both Troilus and Criseyde "seyde as ʒe may here" (5.1316 and 1589). In these cases the reference to the verbatim report of the song or letter is unambiguous. The same cannot be said about the Hymn to Love. The weight of the evidence, then, supports the independent composition of the Hymn. The only circumstance indicating that its omission might be scribal in origin is the inclusion of the passage in the alpha manuscripts Gg and H5, and even this discrepancy may be easily explained. Like Ph and H2, Gg and H5 are closely related, 12 and we therefore have only two independent witnesses to alpha here, one including and the other omitting the passage in question. There is every possibility that the scribe of some antecedent copy from which both Gg and H5 descend supplied the missing stanzas from another source, just as the scribe of Ph has done. In the end Windeatt must admit that the textual situation here reflects "the processes of Chaucer's composition"; he differs with Root only over Chaucer's intentions. Root held that "Chaucer's text existed for a time without the Boethian hymn to love" (p. 157), and he would attribute its inclusion in the majority of manuscripts to late copies made from Chaucer's working text after its substantial revision. Windeatt argues that Chaucer always intended to include the Hymn and that its absence from alpha may have resulted from its being "in the form of a physical addition to the draft which has been confused by certain scribes" (p. 38). On the independent composition of the Hymn, however, Windeatt and Root are in agreement. For the predestination soliloquy of Book 4 (953-1085), Chaucer again abandons the narrative of the Filostrato and looks to Boethius, and again the textual evidence suggests that the interpolation was composed independently, although the nature of that evidence is extremely complex. Of the four manuscripts attesting alpha here, only H3 omits the passage in its entirety and without indication that the scribe noticed any irregularity in the text; line 1086 follows immediately after line 952. Gg omits all but the final, "transitional" stanza of the soliloquy, so that line 952 is followed by 1079, without any gap or mark in the manuscript. Ph originally omitted the whole passage, but the scribe has added it on two inset leaves and has marked its point of insertion, just as he had done in the case of the Hymn to Love. In J the passage follows normally, but after line 1078, at the bottom of folio 83 r , a note has been appended: "her faileth thing y t / is nat yt made." 13 The back of the folio is blank; the next leaf, last of the quire, has been cut out, and the text resumes with line 1079 after a blank space the length of one stanza, at the top of folio 84 r . Because in J there are normally five stanzas to a side, the space left empty corresponds to either six or sixteen stanzas, depending on when and for what reason the missing leaf was removed, but in any case no part of the text has been omitted. To further complicate matters, the entire passage is missing in H4, which is regularly a beta manuscript in this part of the poem. The possibility that the omission is scribal in origin must be admitted, particularly since manuscripts representing two distinct traditions of the text, one presumably revised and the other unrevised, share in this textual feature. Unlike the Hymn to Love, the predestination soliloquy is long enough (nineteen stanzas) for its omission to have been caused by the loss of leaves in an antecedent copy. But the context of the passage and Chaucer's treatment of his sources here make scribal omission highly unlikely. How did it happen that a scribe, or scribes, accidentally passed over precisely those lines in which Chaucer is departing from the narrative of Boccaccio? The context is even more significant, for Chaucer's narrative makes perfect, arguably superior, sense without the soliloquy. Pandarus goes from Criseyde and finds Troilus in the temple; if we omit the suspected interpolation, the narrative runs thus: But to the pitouse goddes euerichone fful tendrely he preyde and made his mone, To doon hym sone out of this world to pace, ffor wel he thoughte ther was non other grace. "O myghty god," quod Pandarus, "in trone, I! who say euere a wis man faren so? Whi Troilus, what thinkestow to doone? Hastow swich lust to ben thyn owen fo? . . ." (4.949-952, 1086-1089) Pandarus makes reference only to Troilus's wish to die; about the long disputation concerning free will and foreknowledge he says nothing. The suspicion that the passage was inserted by Chaucer after his composition of the main part of the narrative is strengthened by the wording of the "transitional" stanza, lines 1079-1085. Troilus has concluded his argument that "the bifallyng / Of thynges that ben wist bifore the tyde, / They mowe nat ben eschued on no syde"; there is a break in his speech at 1079, after which he reasserts his desire to die, and Pandarus, of whom we have heard nothing for over 130 lines, abruptly reenters. Thus the narrative returns to the situation preceding Troilus's soliloquy, and the transition is less than successful from a number of standpoints. For one, the action it relates is not consistent with what has gone before, for Pandarus has already "fond hym al allone" in the temple at line 947, and so his coming in at 1085 repeats an action already described. This may have been an oversight of Chaucer's, but it seems rather to have been deliberately contrived so that Pandarus's response might apply only to Troilus's suicidal lament and not to the soliloquy, which it would seem he should have overheard. Furthermore, line 1079 of the transitional stanza and line 1086 contain a maladroit verbal repetition: Troilus invokes "almyghty Iove in trone," and Pandarus begins his reply "O myghty god . . . in trone." If Chaucer had written these two stanzas successively it seems unlikely that he would have given them such similar initial lines, unless Pandarus's speech is meant to mock that of Troilus. The context of the soliloquy, then, tends to refute Windeatt's assertion that "the poem is unlikely to have been regarded as authentically completed without the predestination passage" (p. 40). Comparison with the Italian also fails to provide the corroboration he claims. Windeatt maintains that Chaucer's Pandarus "expresses himself much more urgently" than Boccaccio's Pandaro, that this "implies that Troilus is in a much more desperate state than in Fil ," and that "without the presence of the soliloquy there is nothing to suggest that this is so or to draw such a response from Pandarus" (p. 42). As we have seen, however, Pandarus comments only on Troilus's desire to die, something that could easily provoke the response he makes. The difference in emphasis, however real it may be, exists in spite of and not because of the soliloquy. To return to the textual situation: the evidence of Ph and H3 is unproblematic. There are some variations in their reading of 4.950-952, which immediately precedes the soliloquy where present, but these differences do not indicate that "at any stage of composition represented by the extant manuscripts, Ch intended the predestination soliloquy to be present in his poem," as Windeatt argues (pp. 41-42). The two versions are these: PhH3 REST he fast made his compleynt and his mone Bysekyng hem to sende hym oþir grace Or from þis world to done hym sone to pace fful tendrely he preyde and made his mone To doon hym sone out of this world to pace ffor wel he thoughte ther was non other grace The differences here are minor and, likely as not, scribal. But Windeatt seizes upon the word compleynt in PhH3 and argues that, paradoxically, the manuscripts that omit the soliloquy imply its presence more emphatically than those which contain the passage. His reasoning is specious, however; compleynt and mone are nearly synonymous and neither need refer to anything more than Troilus's suicidal lament. The reading of PhH3 may represent scribal amplification or, if authorial, may have been altered by Chaucer to eliminate the redundancy, but in any case the variations do not affect the question of revision. It remains clear that the soliloquy was absent from the immediate copies used by each scribe, although here as elsewhere the Ph scribe has noted the omission and supplied the passage later from another source. Gg, which contains only the transitional stanza, presents something of an enigma. As both Root and Windeatt note, 14 the stanza of transition implies the presence of the soliloquy, for Troilus is described as "Disputyng with hym self in this matere" (4.1084). The text as it stands in Gg makes no sense, and Root's proposal, that Chaucer "began, not uncharacteristically, at the end, with the stanza of transition" 15 and that copies were made of his working draft in this state, is hard to credit. Windeatt's judgment, that the situation in Gg is scribal, is undoubtedly correct, but he provides no hypothesis to explain how this stanza came to be preserved independently of the soliloquy to which it refers so explicitly. A partial explanation may be suggested by the even more confusing situation in J. Root (p. 212) notes a generally close agreement between Gg and J in this part of the poem, so it is significant that here again the transitional stanza is divorced from the soliloquy, this time by a blank space left in the manuscript. Much has been written about this feature of the text and about the scribal note concerning the "thing y t is nat yt made." In Root's formulation both note and lacuna go back to an ancestor of J whose scribe was awaiting "matter not yet composed" (p. 217). This hypothesis fits his overall conception of the way the poem was revised, but it is neither necessary nor particularly compelling. As Windeatt points out, the note follows the soliloquy instead of preceding it, as we would expect if the scribe or one of his predecessors had in fact been awaiting new matter from the poet. 16 A more likely sequence of events would be one in which the scribe of some ancestor of J had as his exemplar a manuscript like Gg in which the transitional stanza appeared without the soliloquy. 17 This scribe either recognized the inconsistency presented by the stanza or, through familiarity with copying the text, realized that some substantial part of the narrative was missing; in any event he left space in the manuscript and supplied the soliloquy later from another source. It would appear from the situation in J that he left too much space and that the resulting gap in the manuscript was taken over by subsequent scribes. The note may have found its way into the manuscript line at any point. It may have originated with the interpolator himself, in which case Root is correct in suggesting that a subsequent scribe must be responsible for moving the note to its present position; or it may reflect the attempt of a later copyist or reader to account for the gap. 18 But to ascribe the condition of the text in J to the circumstances immediately surrounding Chaucer's composition of the poem contributes nothing substantial to the theory of revision. We are still left with two puzzling situations: the independent preservation of the transitional stanza in Gg and J, and the omission of the entire passage from H4, which attests beta throughout the last three books. Any number of hypotheses might be advanced to explain the first of these, though Root's solution, as noted above, seems more far-fetched than necessary. All that can be said for certain is that the state of Chaucer's production copy made it possible for scribes to pass over either the entire passage or the stanzas of the soliloquy alone. Windeatt suggests that "It would not be unlikely if the long soliloquy were actually put together as an exercise separately and then married to the draft, always with the consequent possibility of scribal misinterpretation" (p. 41); it may be that the stanza of transition was inserted in a different fashion, perhaps in the margin rather than on the separate leaves containing the soliloquy, so that it might be copied independently. This state of affairs would also allow for the omission of the passage from a manuscript like H4 representing a different tradition of the text. Whatever the true situation may have been, the context of the soliloquy and its relationship to Chaucer's sources reinforce the textual evidence suggesting that the passage was composed independently, as even Windeatt will concede, and that it was inserted into the preexisting and logically completed narrative. The evidence for revision is less clear in the case of Troilus's ascent to the spheres, 5.1807-1827. Although here again Chaucer abandons the narrative of the Filostrato , this time turning to the stanzas of the Teseida (11.1-3) that describe the ascent of Arcita's soul, and although certain manuscripts omit the passage, the witnesses to the text do not divide along the usual lines. Of the manuscripts attesting alpha in Book 5, only Ph originally omitted the three stanzas, and here again the scribe has supplied them on an inset leaf. H3 and J include the passage normally, as presumably would the closely related Gg and H5 had the five leaves containing 5.1702-1869 in Gg and the entire conclusion of the poem in H5, from 4.687 on, not been lost. On the other hand, H2 and H4, which were alpha manuscripts in the early part of the poem but here attest beta, omit the stanzas. Again Windeatt is concerned to argue from context that "these stanzas were always to be included where they occur" (p. 39). He bases his assertion on two short phrases included in all manuscripts: "false worldes brotelnesse" (5.1832), words which, he says, "implicitly contrast this world and the next one where Troilus has gone," and "Swich fyn hath his estat real aboue" (5.1830) which "can have little relation to anything that has gone before, except to the hero's ascent to the spheres." This reasoning is prejudiced by knowledge of the content of those stanzas, however. Nothing incongruous would be apparent to a reader whose text lacked the description of Troilus's ascent, for the transition between lines 1806 and 1828 is perfectly smooth and logical: The wrath as I bigan ʒow for to seye Of Troilus the Grekis boughten deere; ffor thousandes hise hondes maden deye, As he that was with-outen any peere, Saue Ector in his tyme as I kan heere; But weilawey, saue only goddes wille, Despitously hym slough the fierse Achille. Swich fyn hath, lo, this Troilus for loue, Swich fyn hath al his grete worthynesse; Swich fyn hath his estat real aboue, Swich fyn his lust, swich fyn hath his noblesse; Swich fyn hath false worldes brotelnesse: And thus bigan his louyng of Criseyde, As I haue told, and in this wise he deyde. (5.1800-1806, 1828-1834) To Windeatt's arguments it must be objected that the phrase "in this wise he deyde" refers explicitly to the description of Troilus's death at the hands of Achilles rather than to anything related in the three stanzas of his ascent. The connection is obscured by the interposition of twenty-one lines. More importantly, Windeatt's interpretation of "estat real aboue" is questionable; he takes "aboue" in the very narrow sense of physical superiority and would seem to take the line to mean "His royal state had such an end above [i.e., in heaven]." But "aboue" can also connote superiority in rank or power, and the line can be read "His exalted royal state had such an end," 19 which is closer in meaning to the lines of Boccaccio being paraphrased ("cotal fine ebbe il lucido splendore / che lui servava al solio reale," 8.28,5-6) and which parallels the other lines describing the end of worldly vanities. Taken on its own, the "Swich fyn" stanza in no way assumes the presence of Troilus's ascent. If the context allows, even suggests, the possibility that the passage was added by Chaucer, the textual evidence does not support the omission as a feature of alpha. In the case of the Hymn to Love, the two alpha manuscripts that include the passage are closely related and can be supposed to have been subjected to scribal interpolation at some point in their shared ancestry. The one beta manuscript that shares in alpha's omission or textual confusion of the predestination soliloquy may have lost the passage as the result of some disruption in the production copy stemming from the insertion of the passage. In these cases there is good reason to hold that the omissions are genuine features of the alpha tradition, whether or not one believes that alpha represents the poet's first intentions. But the omission of the ascent to the spheres cannot be similarly classified. In this instance Windeatt is probably right to ascribe the textual situation to a "muddle by early scribes over a passage which was perhaps available to them separately because it did not form part of the author's main source" (p. 39). On the other hand, he is not justified in concluding further that "the passage was certainly added in the composition but not necessarily, indeed improbably, in a revision" (p. 40), a judgment based solely on his dubious arguments from context. We have no way of knowing when Chaucer interpolated the three stanzas, although the coincidence of his departure from the Filostrato with a disruption in the text again suggests independent composition. Root may be guilty of "denigrating as scribal the peculiarities of H3 and H2H4" in order to maintain the omission as a feature of alpha, as Windeatt argues, 20 but Windeatt is himself guilty of distorting the contextual evidence in accordance with his skepticism about revision. We again find context, treatment of source, and variation in the manuscripts all pointing to the insertion of a passage into the preexisting narrative, even though in this instance no particular tradition of the text can be associated with one state of the poem or the other. There are, in addition to these large-scale variations between the manuscript groups, several instances of a more limited nature in which, nevertheless, the differences between the textual traditions may be attributed to the hand of the poet. A single stanza in Book 1, lines 890-896, is preserved only in PhH2H4, the manuscripts attesting alpha here, and in the early printed edition of Thynne, which presents a conflated text agreeing with alpha on occasion in Book 1. 21 The stanza comes soon after Troilus's revelation that Criseyde is the object of his love, whereupon Pandarus exhorts Troilus with these words: And forthi loke of good comfort þou be ffor certeinly the first poynt is þis Of noble corage and wele ordeigne A man to haue pees with hym-self y-wis So oghtest þou for [nought but] good it is To loue wele and in [a] worthy place The oght not to clepe hit hap but grace 22 The authenticity of the stanza is not disputed, although the narrative of Boccaccio does not provide a test in this case. Hanna argues that the omission in the majority of manuscripts may be scribal, the result of eyeskip error encouraged by the appearance of "And" as the first word in this stanza and the one following, 23 but the similarity seems rather small to have diverted a number of scribal eyes. If the variation is due to Chaucer, it is possible that the stanza was either added or deleted after the entire passage had been written. There would seem to be no good reason for the poet to have taken the trouble to insert this one stanza, and it is assumed by both Root and Windeatt that he cancelled it as digressive. 24 In this instance, at least, they are agreed on a feature of alpha that appears to represent an early form of the text. In two other cases the evidence for revision involves not the presence or absence of material but the order of stanzas in one tradition of the text as opposed to another. In each instance both textual orders are possible, although one is demonstrably closer to the reading of the Filostrato . In the central love scene of Book 3, the narrator introduces two stanzas in his own voice in which he subjects his poem to the correction of lovers: But sooth is, though I kan nat tellen al, As kan myn auctour of his excellence, ʒet haue I seyd, and god to-forn, and shal In euery thyng al holly his sentence; And if that ich, at loues reuerence, Haue eny word in-eched for the beste, Doth ther-with-al right as ʒoure seluen leste. ffor myne wordes, heere and euery parte, I speke hem all vnder correccioun Of ʒow that felyng han in loues arte, And putte it al in ʒoure discrecioun To encresse or maken dymynucioun Of my langage, and that I ʒow biseche— But now to purpos of my rather speche. (3.1324-1337; 3.1401-1414 in Root's edition) The voice here is distinctively that of Chaucer's narrator, the "sorwful instrument / That helpeth loueres, as I kan, to pleyne," but the ideas are developed by Chaucer from part of a single stanza of Boccaccio's, Filostrato 3.33: O dolce notte, e molto disiata, chente fostù alli due lieti amanti! Se la scienza mi fosse donata che ebber li poeti tutti quanti, per me non potrebbe esser disegnata. Pensisel chi fu mai contanto avanti mercé d'Amor, quanto furon costoro, e saprà 'n parte la letizia loro. In alpha and gamma, Chaucer's adaptation of these sentiments appears in the same position as in Boccaccio, between a stanza beginning "O blisful nyght of hem so long i-sought" and another describing the lovers' wonder at finding themselves together at last, a close translation of Filostrato 3.34. But in H3JRCx, four of the five witnesses attesting beta here, the two stanzas are shifted to a position after 3.1414, and in the fifth beta manuscript, H4, the stanzas appear in both places. In the later arrangement the narrator's comments do not interrupt the flow of the story, for they follow the description of the night's activities and are succeeded by the intrusion of the dawn. The position of the stanzas in beta may be scribal, but if so the new arrangement could hardly have come about through unconscious scribal activity; nothing in the nature of the text would seem likely to induce the shift of so short a passage so far into the narrative. There are, moreover, certain variations in individual readings that seem designed to accommodate the shift, and these are taken by Root to be "important evidence to the deliberate nature of the shift" (p. 157). In alpha and gamma, line 1323 immediately precedes the stanzas and describes the lovers' bliss "That is so heigh that al ne kan I telle." In beta, the line becomes "That is so heygh þat no man kan it telle," presumably because the narrator's protestations of his inability do not here follow. The first line of the shifted stanzas is also altered in beta, so that it begins "But how al thogh" rather than "But sooth is, though." 25 Finally, whereas in most manuscripts line 1415 reads "But whan the cok, commune astrologer," in beta the line begins "Whan that the cok," which avoids the juxtaposition of two lines beginning "But" in these manuscripts. Windeatt admits that the order in beta is just as possible as that in alpha, but he is more inclined to explain the differences as scribal. The thrust of his argument is that the stanzas fit the earlier context better: In brief, the stanzas can stand in either position without absolute incongruity. But as a self-conscious digression on art they are much more contextually implied, and thus more effective, in their earlier position. There remains little positive evidence that the different location of these stanzas in Retc [beta] represents authentic revision when the divergence between the MSS may be compared with a number of bizarre scribal errors by copyists in the TC MSS, where stanzas are misplaced (p. 48). The stanzas may be more effective in their alpha/gamma position, but this proves nothing more than that they were originally composed for this context; it does not mean that they were not or could not have been moved by Chaucer. As to the "number of bizarre scribal errors," the only example cited by Windeatt involves five stanzas in R, 3.1212-1246, that are copied twice, once in their normal position and again after 3.1099. In this instance, however, the stanzas are shifted to an earlier position, which is just what we would expect if a scribe were to mistake the point at which he was to resume copying but later discover his error and begin again where he had in fact left off. There are only a very few genuine examples of a shift of stanzas to a later position in the text, and in none of these is there any evidence of the new context being prepared for the transplanted material. 26 The repositioning of the narrator's apostrophe to lovers, far from being a "bizarre scribal error," represents a deliberate alteration of what must have been Chaucer's original plan for the poem. The responsibility for the shift may lie with the scribes; they were certainly not averse to introducing changes into the texts they copied, even those which, like the Troilus , do not invite and in some ways discourage their active intervention. 27 A motivation for the change is easy to imagine and would presumably be the same as that attributed to Chaucer, the desire to remove the passage to a less intrusive location. But if we are to accept this explanation of the textual situation, we must attribute to the scribe a conscious alteration of the text, involving the rewriting of lines to fit the stanzas to their new context, which at the same time changes the overall structure of the scene but little. It is difficult to imagine scribes going to so much trouble to so little effect, and there is no evidence that they undertook such drastic revision elsewhere in the text of the Troilus . On the other hand, such a change can easily be ascribed to the workings of the poet, who would be more likely to take trouble over subtle arrangements of his text. 28 If Chaucer was indeed responsible for the shift, as the weight of the evidence seems to indicate, we have in this instance one of the very few examples in which beta alone preserves what appears to be a revised form of the text. 29 The second case of revision involving the shift of a stanza comes in Book 4, in a passage describing the visit paid Criseyde by her friends upon learning that she is to be traded to the Greeks in exchange for Antenor. In Boccaccio the women take their leave, whereupon Criseida breaks down in grief: Erasi la dolente in sul suo letto stesa gittata, piangendo sì forte, che dir non si poria; e 'l bianco petto spesso batteasi, chiamando la morte che l'uccidesse, poi che 'l suo diletto lasciar le convenia per dura sorte, e' biondi crin tirandosi rompea, e mille volte ognor morte chiedea. (4.87) Although in translating Chaucer renders Boccaccio's single stanza in something more than two, his Criseyde goes through the same motions as does Criseida. But the sequence of events Boccaccio relates is observed among the Troilus manuscripts only in alpha, here attested by PhGgH3J. In these manuscripts, stanza 108 of Book 4, lines 750-756, which describes Criseyde's weeping, beating her breast, and calling on death, follows the lines in which she falls on her bed (733-735) and is followed in turn by a stanza in which she tears her hair and again invokes death before beginning a long complaint (736-742). In all other witnesses to the text, stanza 108 follows the first stanza of this complaint, interrupting Criseyde's speech with a description of her actions taken from the central portion of Boccaccio's stanza. There is also significant variation in the manuscripts over the reading of 750-752, the opening lines of stanza 108, and of 757, which begins the second stanza of Criseyde's complaint and so in beta and gamma immediately follows the shifted passage. The two versions of 750-752 are these: 30 PhGgH3J REST The salt teris from her eyen tweyne Out ran as shour in Aprill ful swithe; Her white brest she bet &amp; for þe peyne Ther-with the teris from hire eyen two Down fille as shoure in Aperil ful swithe; Hire white brest she bet and for the wo The variations between "tweyne . . . peyne" and "two . . . wo" as well as between "Out ran" and "Down fille" may be scribal and in any case do not affect the question of revision. The important difference lies in the initial wording of each version. Neither "The salt teris" nor "Ther-with the teris" is closer to the Italian, but each is appropriate to the stanza in its particular context. In alpha the stanza comes in the course of a descriptive passage and so requires no transition from what precedes. In beta and gamma, "Therwith" signals a break in direct speech, and although the change is not strictly necessary, it does demonstrate the deliberate nature of the shift. Even more significant are the variations in line 757, which in beta and gamma marks a return to direct discourse: "She seyde, 'how shal he don and ich also?'" In alpha the speech prefix is unnecessary, and the line reads "What shal he don, what shal I do also?" 31 It seems clear that, as with the two stanzas in Book 3, the variations between alpha and beta/gamma represent a deliberate alteration of the text, and that alpha must approximate what Chaucer originally wrote. The alternative, that Chaucer composed the passage with the stanza in the beta/gamma position but that either he or some scribe later moved it, is hardly likely. Chaucer could have done so, but for the poet to revise his text to conform to his source after having written the stanzas in a deliberately original order would defy all reasonable expectation; for a scribe to restore the sequence of the Italian would require a degree of luck or intuition difficult to credit. The converse possibility, that it is the beta/gamma arrangement that is scribal, must be admitted, but the same arguments against a scribal explanation for the shift in Book 3 apply here, and to deny these would be to indict every editor of the Troilus , from Caxton to Windeatt, for printing the non-Chaucerian order in the present passage. Windeatt cannot get around these facts, although he again attempts to denigrate the authority of alpha: But although Ph etc [alpha] is closer to the source in the sequence of some descriptive details, other phrases in the passage show some of that inappropriateness and inferiority more generally characteristic of Ph etc . For the poor quality of some readings, adjacent in the text to others which apparently go back to Ch's first translation of the Italian, suggests that this is the survival, possibly corrupted, of a "rough" early draft (p. 44). Windeatt is forced to admit in this instance what he has taken such pains to deny elsewhere, that alpha preserves an early form of the text revised by Chaucer at some point after the major task of composition. In nearly all of the larger variations between the textual traditions, Windeatt's arguments from context fail to confute the evidence for revision. Only in the case of the Hymn to Love does he present a credible argument that the form of the received text must always have been that intended by Chaucer, and even here he will admit that the composition of the passage was independent of Chaucer's writing of the narrative. Only in the case of Troilus's ascent to the spheres does a suspected revision cut across the familiar lines of the textual traditions. The six examples thus far considered provide more than sufficient evidence that Chaucer revised his text, however locally and at whatever point in the process of composition. This evidence justifies a careful examination of the manuscript variants to determine whether any of these may be due to changes made by the poet. In evaluating the textual work of Manly and Rickert, George Kane considers the question of revision in the text of the Canterbury Tales : The postulate of authorial revision involves the most problematic factor in textual criticism. One way of knowing that authorial revision occurred is from external information, but none is available here. It can be fairly presumed to have occurred in certain classes of situation, such as will be allowed to exist in parts of The Canterbury Tales . But where there is no external information, and where such situations do not obtain, the only means by which authorial revision might be identified is editorial judgment. And once the likelihood of its occurrence in a textual tradition is admitted, it must figure in every comparison of variant readings. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of assessing the likelihood of its occurrence correctly. 32 External evidence of the kind that allows detailed analysis of a poet's method of composition, such as exists in the holograph manuscripts of some of Petrarch's poems, does not survive for any of Chaucer's works, 33 and in the great majority of the Troilus variants the editorial judgment Kane speaks of is the only tool available to decide the question of revision. There are a number of instances, however, in which comparison with Chaucer's source can provide a kind of external information against which to test the priority and originality of readings. Variants closer to the source in detail or in phrasing must be considered the work of Chaucer; to believe that any particular scribe had both a sufficient knowledge of Italian and the access to a manuscript of the Filostrato that would allow him to make such alterations is difficult enough, without further crediting him with taking the time and trouble to compare the poems line by line. 34 When these Italianate readings accompany others whose authenticity is accepted, either because of overwhelming manuscript support or because of their "Chaucerian" qualities, authorial revision may be supposed to be behind the variation, and the direction of the revision can be presumed to have been away from the Italian. 35 The logical alternative would be to discard as scribal the readings furthest from the Italian, even where these form part of the received text, as they so often do. No editor has so far been willing to take this step. 36 Root's argument for the primacy of alpha rested in large part on some striking variants confined to certain portions of the poem, most notably 1.1-1.300, 2.701-2.1113, and 3.400-4.1450. Windeatt accepts some of these as offering "an intriguing glimpse into the process of the poem's composition" (p. 44), but both he and Hanna are quick to point out that, in Hanna's words, "at many points by his [Root's] own account β or γ resembles the Italian more nearly than does a ." 37 This state of affairs should hardly be surprising, however, considering the relatively extensive corruptness of the alpha manuscripts in general and Ph in particular, compared with the manuscripts of beta or gamma. The fact remains that there are a number of alpha variants that are remarkably closer to the Italian at points in the text where equally striking and apparently authorial readings are also to be found, while the converse situation is extraordinarily rare, although one could not infer this from the very general comments of Windeatt and Hanna. Clearly a more detailed analysis would reveal whether there is any justification for their objections to what Hanna sees as Root's belief in " a 's unique similarity to the Italian" (p. 199). In selecting the evidence for analysis, some criteria must first be established. We are concerned here only with variations meeting the following conditions: 1) Chaucer is following his source, usually the Filostrato ; 2) the traditions of the text are at variance; 3) the alternative readings are not manifestly corrupt; 4) one reading is closer to the source than the others. A list of some 103 examples was compiled by McCormick and revised by Root for publication by the Chaucer Society, 38 and these together with a few additional cases noted by Windeatt in his Commentary may serve as a basis for analysis. To begin with the more striking instances in which alpha appears closer to the Italian, we find a number of significant variants in two stanzas of Book 1, lines 78-91: 39 1.78 a + Th: Wherfor to departe all softely Rest: ffor which forto departen softely Per che segretamente di partirsi (1.9,1) 1.83 a: Hopyng in hym kunnyng hem to rede (kunnyng hem] them k. W) Rest: In trust that he hath konnynge hem to rede da lui sperando sommo e buon consiglio (1.9,7) 1.85 a + Th: Grete rumour was whan hit was ferst aspyed (rumour] noyse W. was] gan H2H4; began W; rose Th) Rest: The noise vp rose whan it was first aspied Fu'l romor grande quando fu sentito (1.10,1) In the first instance, despite Windeatt's comment that "Ph etc is further from Fil ," both Wherfor and ffor which are equally plausible and idiomatic translations of the Italian, and in fact the former is used by Chaucer to translate per che on three occasions in the Troilus (1.430, 1.988, 3.281). In the other examples, however, alpha is much closer to the Italian in translating sperando as hopyng and 'l romor grande as Grete rumour , 40 and while Root may be correct in calling the first of these "a rather bald translation," Windeatt admits in both instances that alpha "perhaps retains a trace of Ch's translating process." 1.110-111 a: Byfor Ector on knees she fyll adoun (+CxTh) Wiþ chier &amp; voys ful pytous and wepyng (chier &amp;] clere, W) Rest: On knees she fil biforn Ector adown (b.E.s.f. GgH5) With pitous vois, and tendrely wepynge ginocchion si gittò a piè d' Ettore , e con voce e con vista assai pietosa (1.12,5-6) Alpha retains the Italian vista , which is not translated in the other manuscripts. Windeatt concedes the point, but he quibbles about the variant word order in 110, where alpha is "further from [ Filostrato ] 12/5," when in fact the more natural word order in alpha marks the variant as typically scribal and therefore irrelevant to the discussion of proximity to the source. 1.124 PhH2H4: And she hym þonkyd oft in humble chere Rest: And she hym thonked with ful humble chere Ella di questo il ringraziò assai (1.14,5) The variation here is slight; alpha's oft (a reading not shared by W) may retain the original assai , as Windeatt notes. 1.169 a: Among þe which was Criseida (was] was this H2; was than W) Rest: Among thise othere folk was Criseyda Tra li qua' fu di Calcàs la figliuola Criseida . . . . (1.19,1-2) Root and Windeatt note alpha's more literal translation of Tra li qua ', and although its form of the line is not metrically regular, it is unlikely to have arisen by scribal substitution for the more explicit thise othere folk . 2.734-735 a + Th: Men love wymmen al this towne about; (al] þour al, Gg) Be they þe wors? [why] nay, without dout (why] GgH5Th; om PhH2) Rest: Men louen wommen al biside hire leue, And whan hem leste namore, lat hem byleue Io non conosco in questa terra ancora niuna sanza amante . . . . . . . e come gli altri far non è peccato, né ne può esser alcun biasimato . (2.70,3-4 and 7-8) Alpha is closer to the Italian in including al this towne about , suggested by in questa terra , and in Criseyde's rhetorical question, which retains the rationalization of Boccaccio's heroine that it is no sin to do as others do. 3.1482 aβ: Seth þat desire right now so streynith me Rest: Syn that desire right now so biteth me (biteth] brenneth Cl; bitleth H1) sì mi stringe il disio del ritornarci (3.46,2) The beta manuscripts join alpha in the majority reading streynith , which translates stringe much more literally than biteth , the reading of only five manuscripts and a possible scribal substitution. But Windeatt joins other editors in regarding biteth as "authentic . . . and stronger," which leads him inevitably to the conclusion that because alpha "must stem from Ch's translating," the readings reflect authorial revision. 41 3.1617 aβ: Til al was seyd, and þan he þs answerde Rest: Tyl al was seyde, and than he hym answerde (hym] thus him H3) . . . e poi così rispose lieto a' detti suoi (3.59,7-8) Beta again joins alpha in a minor variation that does, nevertheless, reflect the Italian ( così ) more closely than the alternative reading. Windeatt rejects hym as scribal, reasoning that the word has been attracted from the preceding line ("And Pandarus ful sobrely hym herde"), but modern editors are divided as to whether to emend the line. 42 4.37 PhJ: Þis purpos &amp; þat day þei [issen] mente (issen] J; issu Ph) Rest: This purpos and that day they fighten mente (they fighten mente] t. fouhten m. H4; þe þus m. H2; of assignement H5) incontro a' Greci uscì ne' campi piani (4.1,6) Issen , "to go out," translates uscì literally, and there can be little doubt that, as Windeatt puts it, the reading "retains here a trace of Ch's translating," even though Chaucer is not following Boccaccio line by line at this point and, in fact, 4.39 may be a closer paraphrase of the Italian: "Ector and many a worthi wight out wente." Of the manuscripts reading issen , only Ph attests alpha here, although the confusion in H2 and H5 may well stem from the scribes' attempt to make sense of a difficult term, and the remaining alpha manuscript, Gg, is out at this point, having lost two leaves. It is thus possible to regard issen as a genuine feature of alpha, although J does not normally give alpha readings until 4.431. 43 4.246-247 α: His eyen too for pyte of his hert So wepyn þat þei semyn wellis twey Rest: His eyen two, for piete of herte, Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye; Li miseri occhi per pietà del core forte piangean, e parean due fontane (4.28,1-2) ( Piangono si che paion due fontane , 5.24 in the Baroni ed., Paris 1789) As both Root and Windeatt note, alpha is clearly closer to the Italian, particularly in the form of the line presented by Baroni in the Paris edition. At the same time, the reading Out stremeden as swifte is, in Windeatt's words, "superior and obviously authentic" and must therefore have come about as the result of authorial revision. 4.258 α: But þo bygan his teris out more to breste Þat wele vnnethe þe body may suffise Rest: But tho bygonne his teeris more out breste, That wonder is the body may suffise che 'l capo e 'l petto appena gli bastava (4.29,7) Alpha's wele vnnethe translates the Italian appena , "scarcely," while "the reading wonder is also seems authentic in a context where Ch has doubled the extent of T's suffering" (Windeatt). 4.290 α: How shal my sorowful lyf don in þis cas? (sorowful] reuful Gg) Rest: What shal my sorwful lif don in this cas? come farà la mia vita dolente (4.33,3) A minor variation, but alpha's How does translate come with greater precision. Root does not attach much significance to this example, but Windeatt will admit that alpha "possibly reflects Ch's translation." 4.318 α+ ADH2: Who shal now yeue comfort to my peyne? (my] your H3) Rest: Who shal now ʒeuen comfort to the peyne? (the] thy S1Th) chi darà più conforto alle mie pene? (4.36,3) Considerable variation in the reading of this one word may mark the example as scribal, despite the coincidence of the Italian mie . In particular, the agreement of the nonallied ADH2 and the coincident variation of S1 Th and H3 in a third reading make difficult any claim for authorial revision here. Root and Windeatt do not comment. 4.590 α: Ne p re ciously, but help thi self anone Rest: Ne corteisly, but help thi selue anon (corteisly] preciently R; curyously Cx) Non guarda amor cotanto sottilmente (4.72,1) Windeatt remarks that " preciously is perhaps closer to sottilmente ," and in fact, as Root notes, corteisly does not fit the context of the English or the sense of the Italian, and it may be a corruption of curyously . Most editors nonetheless accept corteisly as Chaucer's. 44 4.596-597 α: Hit is no [rape] in my dome ne no vyse Hir to witholdyn þat þe louith moost (rape] iape PhGg. no(2)] om GgH5) Rest: It is no shame vn-to ʒow ne no vice Hire to withholden that ʒe loue most Tu non hai a rapir donna che sia dal tuo voler lontana . . . (4.73,1-2) Though Chaucer's paraphrase is not exact in either case, alpha retains the Italian rapir , 45 while the other reading is also apparently authentic. Windeatt admits that the variation "may reflect Ch's translation process here." 4.762-763 α: And cursid be þat day which þat Argyue Me of her body bare to bene a lyve Rest: O moder myn, that cleped were Argyue, Wo worth that day that thow me bere on lyue! Oh, trista me, che'n mal punto fui nata, dove ti lascio, dolce l' amor mio? Deh, or foss' io nel nascere affogata (4.88,3-5) Mal' abbia il giorno, che al mondo fui nata, E che di me mia madre ebbe desio! (5.73 in the Paris ed.) Windeatt comments that "The Ph etc [alpha] variant perhaps reflects the reference to birth in Fil 88/5," but Chaucer's paraphrase is even closer to the corresponding lines in the Paris edition, which Root claims "correspond more nearly to α than βγ." In fact, both versions seem to owe something different to the variant readings of the Paris edition, and it is likely that both are authorial. 4.820 α: Whan she hym sawe she gan for shame anone Rest: Whan she hym saugh she gan for sorwe anon La qual come lui vide, fra la braccia per vergogna nascose la sua faccia . (4.96,7-8) Alpha's shame translates vergogna precisely, and Windeatt sees "a trace here of Ch's translating process." 46 4.882 αβ : As he þat [shortly shapith hym] to dey (shapith hym shortly, Ph; shortly he þat, H2H4) Rest: ffor verray wo his wit is al aweye il qual del tutto in duol ne vuol morire (4.102,8) Che cerca disperato di morire (5.84 in the Paris ed.) The reading of alpha and beta is clearly closer to the Italian, while the other version "offers a somewhat simpler sentence structure" in Root's view and, according to Windeatt, improves on Chaucer's first attempt, which "seems clumsy coming before 883-884." 47 4.906 α : To se hym in þat woo þat he is ynne Rest: To sen that sorwe which that he is inne ma più m' è di veder Troiolo afflitto (4.105,2) The syntax of alpha (Pandarus sees Troilus in woe) is somewhat closer to the Italian than that of the other version (he sees the sorrow Troilus is in), as Windeatt and Root note. 4.1124α+ RH2H4: But whan þat hit was tyme for to go Rest: And whan that it was tyme for to go . . . ma quando tempo gli parve di dovere andare (4.113,3-4) All but one of the witnesses to beta join alpha in this minor variation, which is, nonetheless, closer to the Italian ( ma ). But is actually more appropriate in context, for Troilus has "seyde vn-to it more," but now he will, "withouten mo, / Unto hire com." The reading And , while generally preferred, may have been attracted from the preceding line. Windeatt accepts the reading of his copy-text without comment. 4.1214 α : And he answerid, "hert myn, Criseyde, . . ." Rest: And he answerde, "lady myn, Criseyde, . . ." A cui el disse:—Dolce mio disiro (4.124,3) Although Windeatt does not comment, the alpha reading may retain something of the Italian not found in the other manuscripts. Root notes that "All MSS. read herte myn in 1216, which may explain the revision," but by the same token it might be concluded that alpha preserves a scribal error of anticipation. 4.1218 α : And he bygan comforte her as he might Rest: And he bigan to glad hire as he myghte . . . e 'l suo martiro, come potea, con parole alleggiando, la confortò . . . (4.124,5-7) Alpha's comforte is clearly closer to the Italian, as Root and Windeatt note, but to glad has generally been preferred and may be the result of revision. 48 It should be said, however, that all manuscripts read And hire to glade at 1220, and it might be argued that the majority reading at 1218 represents another scribal error of anticipation. 5.1028 α : The causes why, the soth for to telle (causes] cause H3) Rest: The cause whi, the sothe forto telle e da queste cagion sommossa . . . (6.34,7) A minor variation, one in which H3 does not share, but the plural causes is closer to the Italian ( queste cagion ), as Windeatt and Root note. These twenty-four examples represent only a portion of those readings in which alpha may be thought to preserve an early stage in Chaucer's composition of the poem; they do not by any means include all of the most interesting or significant of the alpha variants, but have been selected because in these cases the Filostrato provides a test of authenticity. Windeatt (p. 43) may be justified in describing them as being "of very varying quality," but they are all arguably closer to the Italian, and in at least half of the examples the resemblance is so striking as to rule out coincidental similarity. Windeatt relegates discussion of this evidence largely to his Commentary, and his typical remark is that alpha "perhaps retains a trace of Ch's translating process." In his argument dismissing alpha's claim to priority, his examination of specific resemblances to the Italian is so brief that it may be quoted in its entirety: Cf. the Ph etc line at IV, 247, which is closer to Italian, while the other MSS contain what is not only an equally authentic line, but one which renders something of the Italian Ph etc does not translate. Or again, consider the Ph etc variant lines at I, 83, 85, which seem to translate Fil more closely than the clearly authentic reading in the other MSS. Yet nearness to Italian produces an abrupt, irregular line at 83, which is not a better reading for being closer to Fil (p. 43). To this he adds in a note: Thus, at I, 169, Ph etc is rather closer to li qua '; and at I, 118, there is some resemblance; at I, 111, Ph etc is closer to Fil , yet at 110 further away. At II, 734-5 Ph etc is perhaps closer to Fil 2.70. At IV, 37, Ph etc seems closer to uscì in Fil ; at IV, 258 Ph etc oneþe seems to echo appena ; at 820, Ph etc shame reflects vergogna rather than sorwe in other MSS (but cf. II, 1291); at 596, Ph etc rape seems closer to rapir in Fil than shame in other MSS; at 906 Ph etc is perhaps closer to Fil ; at IV, 1218, Ph etc confort reflects confortò , which becomes glade in other MSS. Having thus dispensed with alpha, Windeatt notes "the many instances throughout the poem where the other MSS are closer to the Italian than Ph etc " (p. 43), and with that comment rests his case. Hanna remarks that "Root attempted to handle this problem by defining as scribal errors all α passages which do not resemble the Italian more nearly than βγ" (p. 287, n. 17), but neither he nor Windeatt defends these assertions. Certainly there are many instances throughout the poem where an individual manuscript or a manuscript group can be shown to be further from the Italian than the other manuscripts; the question is whether such variants have any claim to authority. In many of the examples analyzed above, the readings of the received text are widely regarded to be the work of Chaucer, despite the existence of variant readings closer to the Italian. In most cases, however, the readings further from the Italian will likely prove to be scribal, and in fact most are manifestly corrupt. As a result, it may be fair to ask whether the remarks of Windeatt and Hanna regarding the "many instances . . . where the other MSS are closer to the Italian than Ph etc " are germane to the question of revision. Are there, in fact, "many instances" in which alpha preserves a reading further from the Italian that is not a clear case of error? The examples noted by Windeatt—Hanna provides none of his own—should resolve the matter. 1.57-58 PhH4W: Knowyn þing is how þat þe grekys strong (þing] well it W) Wiþ armes in a m. shippes went Rest: Yt is wel wist how that the Grekes stronge In armes with a thousand shippes wente Erano a Troia li greci re d' intorno nell' armi forti, . . . . (1.7,1-2) Windeatt remarks that "in 58 Ph etc With for In is further from nell' armi ," but in fact not all of the alpha manuscripts give this reading, and in any case the change is merely one of word order. 1.117-118 α : And seyd, "lete ʒour fadris tresoun gone To sory hap, &amp; ʒe ʒour self in ioy . . . ." Rest: And seyde, "lat ʒoure fadres treson gon fforth with meschaunce, and ʒe ʒoure self in ioie . . . ." dicendo:—Lascia con la ria ventura tuo padre andar che n' ha offeso tanto (1.13,5-6) Windeatt is correct in noting that "Ph etc 's reading To sory hap is further from con in Fil 13/4 [sic]," although it could be argued that in translating ria ventura as sory hap , alpha is somewhat closer to the Italian. But meschaunce is undoubtedly Chaucer's, and in any case To sory hap would be a familiar expression (cf. Romaunt 7582) and therefore an easy scribal substitution. 1.159 α : In meny wise shewed, as y rede Rest: In sondry wises shewed, as I rede e 'n diversi atti mostra suoi amori (1.18,4) Windeatt remarks that the "Ph etc reading meny is further from Fil here," and sondry is in fact a more exact translation of diversi. Meny is easier and is for that reason a likely scribal substitution. 1.272 PhH2H4: His eye perceyvid, and so depe hit went Rest: His eye percede, and so depe it wente (percede] procede CpCl; preceded D; persedyn Gg; departed R; perceded S2) l' occhio suo vago giunse penetrando (1.26,5) The variations here are so many and so obviously scribal that Windeatt's comment ("Ph etc [H2H4Ph] is corrupted away from Fil ") is entirely gratuitous, and in fact one witness to alpha, W, reads persed . A difficult expression and confusion over abbreviation evidently compounded the errors here. 1.407 PhH2H4: And if y in myn owne lust brenne (y] om H4. brenne] I b. H4) Rest: And if that at myn owen lust I brenne S' a mia voglia ardo, onde 'l pianto e lamento? (Petrarch, Sonnet 132) As Windeatt notes, the majority reading is "closer to Petrarch ( S' a ) than Ph etc reading in ," but the simple substitution of an easier expression marks the variant as scribal. Note that W again fails to attest a supposed alpha reading further from Chaucer's source. 1.483 α+ R: That all þe grekys as the dethe hym dredde (all þe] alle R; all H4) Rest: That the Grekes as the deth him dredde che li Greci il temien come la morte (1.46,8) A beta manuscript joins alpha in adding all , which is not in the Italian. The addition of a word that improves the meter might be charged to the poet or the scribes; the variation here is of no importance. 2.1093α+ JRH4: This Pandare vp þer with, &amp; þat betyme Rest: This Pandare tok the lettre, and that by-tyme (the lettre] om H3) Pandaro, presa la lettera pia (2.108,1) Alpha and three of four beta manuscripts omit Pandarus's taking the letter and so are further from the Italian. No scribal explanation for the change suggests itself, but the omission of the lettre in H3 would seem to indicate some confusion in the manuscripts having nothing to do with revision. 3.349 α : And al þe rehetyng of his sikes sore Rest: And al the richesse of hise sikes sore (richesse] tresour H4; thoughtis Cx) Li sospir, ch' egli aveva a gran divizia (3.11,5) The majority reading richesse reflects the Italian divizia ; the variant readings of alpha, here attested by only two manuscripts, and of H4 and Cx look very much like scribal substitutions, although rehetyng , "assailing, attacking," is in many ways the harder reading. 49 3.1360α+ others: And wel a C tymes gan he syke β+ SI: And wel a thousand tymes gan he syke . . . e nessuna ora sanza mille sospiri valicava (3.37,3-4) Alpha and a majority of the other manuscripts give a reading further from the Italian, but either may be the original; the error is a common one perhaps occasioned by a confusion over the interpretation of Roman numerals. 4.238 α : In his distresse, as y shall ʒow devise (distresse] distreste Gg) Rest: In his woodnesse, as I shal ʒow deuyse ch' uom non parea, ma arrabbiata fera (4.26,8) Windeatt claims that woodnesse is the "harder reading, and closer to Fil , than distresse in Ph etc ," but although Chaucer is following Boccaccio closely in the preceding lines, the line in question bears only a slight resemblance to the Italian, and neither reading can thus be said to be "closer to Fil ." Alpha's distresse is easier, however, and can for that reason be dismissed as scribal. 4.295-296 α : What shal y do? y shal whil y may dure In woo, in turment, and yn cruel peyne Rest: What shal I don? I shal, while I may dure On lyue in torment and in cruwel peyne Io piangerò e sempre doloroso starò dove ch' io sia, mentre la vita mi durerà 'n questo corpo angoscioso! (4.34,1-3) Alpha is further from the Italian than the other manuscripts, which translate mentre la vita / mi durerà as while I may dure / On lyue . Alpha's In woo is easier, as Windeatt notes, and probably represents scribal amplification upon the torments elaborated in the remainder of the line. 4.306 PhGgH5: ffle forth a none and do myn hert to brest (to] om GgH5) Rest: ffle forth out of myn herte and lat it breste esci del core e Criseida segui (4.34,7) H3, which joins alpha at 4.300 and generally adheres to its readings throughout the rest of the poem, does not share in this minor variation. Windeatt is correct in saying that "Ph etc 's line is further from Fil 34/7," but alpha does not "omit" del core , as he claims, but instead employs hert in a syntactic construction different from that in the Italian. The change is typical of scribal activity. 4.347 α : ffor Antenore to chaungyn [so] Criseyde (so] GgH3H5; om Ph) Rest: ffor Antenor to ʒelden so Criseyde e come aveano ancora per partito preso di render Criseida i signori (4.43,3-4) The majority reading ʒelden reflects render more accurately than alpha's chaungyn , an easy scribal substitution in this context (cf. 4.665, where chaunge is used by Chaucer in a similar construction). 4.506-507 α : Or deþe me slowe, y wold have ʒevyn hire But now his comyng is to me so swete (his] om H3J. comyng is] is c. J) Rest: Er thow me slowe I wolde haue yeuen hire; But now thi comynge is to me so swete Morte, tu mi sarai tanto soave, quant' è la vita a chi lieta la mena (4.61,1-2) The direct address of death in the majority of the manuscripts follows Boccaccio's practice in the corresponding stanza of the Filostrato , though Chaucer is not translating the Italian verbatim here. Alpha exhibits the scribal tendency toward greater explicitness. 4.537 α : Rys vp anone and lete þis sorow be Rest: Ris vp anon and lat this wepyng be caccia via il dolor, caccial via, caccia l'angoscia tua e li dolenti guai, rasciuga il tristo pianto della faccia (4.65,4-6) The Italian provides support for both sorow and wepyng ( dolor and tristo pianto ); the majority reading is probably Chaucer's, though either would be an easy scribal substitution for the other. 4.602 α+ Cx: And fleith from wrecchis for hir cowardise Rest: And weyueth wrecches for hire cowardise . . . La Fortuna aiuta chiunque ardisce e' timidi rifiuta . (4.73,7-8) Alpha's fleith from is probably further from rifiuta , "spurns," than the majority reading weyueth, "neglects, abandons." The substitution of an easier expression may be suspected here; compare 2.284, where the "good" manuscripts Cp and Cl have corrupted weyuen , here in rhyme position. 4.732 αβ+ Si: In to þe chambre went vp out of þe hall (went vp] Ph; w. GgH2H4; rest vp w.) Rest: In-to hire chambre vp went out of the halle nella camera sua piangendo piano se n' entrò dentro . . . (4.86,5-6) A minor variation in which half the manuscripts correctly reflect the Italian ( camera sua ) while the others make the easy substitution of the definite article for the personal pronoun. 4.1134 PhGg: As y seyd arst, for sorow and [for] wepyng (for(2)] Gg; om Ph) Rest: As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbyng (wo] sorwe H3) sì gl'impedivan gli angosciosi pianti e' singhiozzi e' sospiri, . . . (4.115,4-5) Windeatt claims that "Ph etc omits singhiozzi " (p. 52, n. 10), but in fact only two of four alpha manuscripts actually read wepyng for sobbyng , which are in any case interchangeable in scribal practice. These eighteen examples include all of the "many instances" noted by Windeatt where alpha is further from the Italian. Most of these he treats only in his Commentary, but in a note supporting his contention that alpha's similarities to the Italian are not unique, he singles out a number of them, among which are several of the least compelling. 50 If the Italianate readings in alpha are "of very varying quality," as Windeatt suggests, these are not; with hardly an exception, they are uniformly scribal. Only alpha's rehetyng (3.349) can be defended as difficult enough to merit attention. Furthermore, in five instances the variant further from the Italian is not attested by all alpha manuscripts, and in another five cases other manuscripts join alpha in the divergent reading. The same is true in nearly all of the remaining examples in which variation may be tested against Chaucer's sources. These need not be examined in detail and have instead been summarized in an appendix. In most cases at least some of the alpha manuscripts are among those witnesses that are close to the Italian, although the resemblance is often trifling and may be coincidental. The same is true where alpha does not reflect the original, and in such cases other manuscripts join alpha in what look like easier readings. The evidence suggests that Root was correct in ascribing such variation to scribal error, despite Hanna's implication that he thus justified an unwarranted belief in "α's unique similarity to the Italian." To say this is not to disagree with Windeatt's view that "The evidence for a sustainedly distinct version or state of Ch's text, earlier and closer line by line to the Italian source, does not exist" (p. 43), an idea never advanced by Root and not defended here. It is to say that where remarkable variants undeniably closer to the Italian exist side by side with other, equally authentic readings, the Italianate form is invariably preserved by alpha. This state of affairs reinforces the evidence from the large-scale variations suggesting that in at least some of its particulars alpha reflects an early stage in Chaucer's composition of the poem. What then may be said of Windeatt's view of the text of Troilus and Criseyde as compared with the theory advanced by Root? Although the case made here places greater emphasis on alpha's priority than does Windeatt and disputes a number of his major conclusions, it is not intended as a defense of Root's overall conception of the textual tradition. In fact, the view taken here may in some ways be more compatible with Windeatt's position than with Root's. Root was concerned to show that Chaucer "published" his poem in an early version, and that he later made changes in the publication copy supplied by his scribe Adam. Quite apart from the lack of any evidence to support it, this hypothesis involved Root in some logical inconsistencies, as Hanna notes, the most important being that "if production of fair copy was a prerequisite for medieval publication (a view invoked in discussing α), Chaucer should have had a second fair copy produced in order to publish the β version." 51 In contrast, Windeatt offers no new and elaborate theory of the text, preferring not to speculate as to just how the traditions of the text arose and how authorial variation came to be preserved in the manuscripts. We should probably prefer Windeatt's agnosticism to Root's certitude, but on one point we can do more than speculate. It is clear from the manuscript evidence that the Troilus must have been copied more than once from some manuscript or manuscripts containing authorial variation. A single publication copy cannot account for the kind of authentic revision detailed above, unless the authorized version of the text was later conflated with the poet's earlier drafts. Whether these copies were made before Chaucer had completed his alterations, perhaps by associates of the poet enlisted "ther nede is, to correcte" what he had written, 52 or whether his foul papers continued to be available after he had finished with the poem, allowing alternative readings to enter the textual tradition, we have no way of knowing. For this reason theories intended to establish a sequence in the process of revision are speculative at best; priority may be determinable in an individual instance of variation, but the manuscript evidence does not justify the formulation of larger patterns. More may also be said about the character of alpha. Root used the designation α to refer to two separate entities, the corrected fair copy of Chaucer's first draft and the extant manuscripts supposed to represent it. 53 In his theory of the text it was also a version of the poem, distinct in time, and in the mind of the poet, from the later forms. As established in the foregoing argument, however, Root's theory presupposes a process of composition, publication, and textual transmission difficult to credit. Because no sequence can be established in the process of revision, it is impossible to regard the alpha readings in aggregate as forming a version of the poem, in any ordinary sense; and, in any case, the differences between alpha and beta or gamma are neither as extensive nor as pervasive as those between the versions of Langland's Piers Plowman or, for that matter, between the F and G Prologues to Chaucer's own Legend of Good Women . 54 Alpha is first and foremost a manuscript group or, more accurately, a tradition of the text represented throughout the poem by Ph and locally by a shifting alliance of manuscripts, and as such must be seen as a scribal product, as both Windeatt and Hanna remark. "What the Ph etc MSS largely present," says Windeatt, "is the character of a manuscript grouping, not a 'version' of the text. To all intents and purposes the Ph etc family has no identity which is anything other than scribal, except in certain parts of Books I, III and IV" (p. 45). Hanna says much the same, although in terms considerably more forceful and more critical of Root's treatment of the evidence: "Thus Root almost forgets to identify α as a genetic group (or scribal version, which it is . . .); only belatedly and offhandedly in The Textual Tradition , pp. 254-255, does he note this fact" (p. 286, n. 11). But to recognize the scribal character of alpha is not to denigrate the authority of many of its readings. Every text that has its origin in a manuscript culture survives as a scribal construct, 55 and textual traditions are defined in large measure by the common errors of copying shared by the individual manuscripts that make up the group; these observations are as true of gamma or beta as of alpha. The distinctive features that identify alpha as a group may not correspond to any authorized "version" of the poem as envisioned by Chaucer, but a substantial number of them, large and small, may be traced to the hand of the poet. Finally, it may be asked in what precise sense the Troilus may be said to have been revised. Root used the term "revision" in its most formal sense, to refer to the changes made by the author on his completed and scribally published text, and in the portion of his Conclusion on "The Method of Revision" (pp. 256-260) he spells out in detail his theory concerning the fair copy produced by "Adam scriveyn" and the corrections and revisions performed on it by Chaucer. Windeatt justifiably rejects this hypothesis, but despite his efforts to minimize the importance of authorial variation, he finds himself referring time and again to "a 'rough' early draft" and to "traces of the process of composition." He declines to term these examples of "revision," but what else do we call the writer's process of drafting, with its additions, alterations, and deletions? 56 Windeatt distinguishes authorial variation in the Troilus from what he agrees to call revision in the texts of Piers Plowman and the Confessio Amantis by saying that, by contrast, "most of the distinctions between the TC MSS give the impression of being curiously on top of one another, in both the temporal and spatial sense of the expression" (p. 50), but he has no more proof of the synchronism of variants than Root had of their sequence in an orderly process of revision. Windeatt summarizes his view of revision in the text of the Troilus with an intriguing analogy: "To say that TC existed for a while without its philosophical passages is comparable to saying that St Paul's Cathedral existed for a while without its dome: that is, until the plan implied by the rest of the structure was completed" (p. 51). Apart from exaggerating the prominence of the Boethian interpolations, the comparison endows them with an inevitability that the contextual evidence will not support. In point of fact, however, the analogy is apt in ways Windeatt does not intend, for the familiar aspect of Wren's masterpiece reflects only the final stage of a plan that underwent at least two major revisions and was altered by the architect even after construction had begun. In addressing the question of revision in the Troilus , Windeatt betrays an almost teleological approach to the text: because the finished poem evinces a certain plan, he seems to say, that plan must always have been the one intended by Chaucer. To be fair, there are certainly features of the text that belong to any state of the poem represented by the extant manuscripts, but the variations under discussion are not of this sort. Unlike Root, we cannot claim to know when the revisions were made or how they came to be preserved in the manuscript tradition. But we must recognize that in certain circumstances the evidence reveals Chaucer's continuing engagement with his text, whether during the initial process of composition or some time after he had completed the main part of the narrative, and that the revisions made by Chaucer altered the structure and meaning of the poem in significant ways and were not simply the inevitable final touches to a preconceived plan, as Windeatt would have it. In the absence of holograph manuscripts and explicit statements of authorial intent, the variations preserved in the manuscript tradition provide invaluable evidence for the method of composition of the greatest English poet of his time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Barry Windeatt, ed., Troilus and Criseyde: A new edition of "The Book of Troilus" (1984). Unless otherwise indicated, textual citations for the Troilus are from this edition. 2 Root's hypothesis, which is developed throughout his study The Textual Tradition of Chaucer's Troilus (Chaucer Society, First Series 99, 1916; rpt. New York: Johnson Reprint, 1967), is expressed most fully on pp. 180-181. 3 Since the publication of Root's edition, only one beta text has appeared, that edited by Daniel Cook for Anchor Books (1966; rpt. Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1974). The editions of Robinson, Baugh, Donaldson, and Fisher all give gamma texts. 4 See in Windeatt's edition the section of the Introduction on "The text of the 'Troilus,'" especially pp. 37-43. 5 Ralph Hanna III, Chapter 10 of Editing Chaucer: The Great Tradition , ed. Paul G. Ruggiers (Pilgrim Books, 1984); for Hanna's acceptance of Windeatt's conclusions, see p. 286 n. 8. 6 McCormick's only published accounts of his view of the text are a report of a paper delivered to the Philological Society, printed in Academy 48 (1895), p. 552, and the short introduction to his edition of the Troilus for the Globe Chaucer , ed. A. W. Pollard et al. (1898), pp. xli-xlii. 7 Charles A. Owen, Jr., " Troilus and Criseyde : The Question of Chaucer's Revisions," Studies in the Age of Chaucer , 9 (1987), pp. 155-172. Owen's article, which appeared after the main part of this study had been completed, considers five of the six major revisions analyzed in the first half of this study, and comes to similar conclusions regarding Chaucer's responsibility for the revisions. However, Owen is concerned to defend the whole of Root's theory, including his hypothesis regarding the incrementally revised scribal copy culminating in the beta version. As will be argued here, recognizing authorial revision in the manuscripts does not oblige one to accept all aspects of Root's theory. 8 The Riverside Chaucer , general editor Larry Benson (1987), p. 1161. Stephen Barney, who edited the text of the Troilus for this volume and provided the textual and explanatory notes for the poem, is skeptical about Root's theories but does accept some of the evidence for revision. 9 The attestation of the alpha text is as follows: 1.1-1.546, PhH2H4W; 1.547-2.65, PhH2H4; 2.66-2.1210, PhH2GgH5; 2.1211-3.398, PhH2; 3.399-4.196, PhH2GgH5; 4.197-4.299, PhGgH5; 4.300-4.430, PhH3GgH5; 4.431-4.686, PhJH3GgH5; 4.687-End, PhJH3Gg (H5 out). Sigils follow those in Windeatt's edition. 10 Textual Tradition , pp. 155-157. For the common errors of PhH2, see pp. 55-58, 94-98, 142-147, and 211-212. It should be noted that on paleographic evidence the scribe of Ph has been identified with one of the scribal hands of H2; he wrote 1.71-497, 1.568-3.1078, and 3.1639-4.196, which includes the Hymn to Love. 11 The Filostrato is quoted from the edition by Vittore Branca in Volume II of Tutte le opere di Giovanni Boccaccio , general editor Vittore Branca (Verona: Arnoldo Mondadori, 1964). 12 For a partial list of common errors in GgH5, see Textual Tradition , pp. 73-75, 98-99, 147, and 212. 13 See St. John's College, Cambridge, Manuscript L.i.: A Facsimile , Volume 3 of The Facsimile Series of The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, general editor Paul G. Ruggiers (Norman, Oklahoma: Pilgrim Books, 1983). 14 Textual Tradition , p. 219; Windeatt, p. 42. 15 Textual Tradition , p. 219. Owen, "The Question of Chaucer's Revisions," agrees with Root: "the evidence would seem to show that the transition stanza was composed earlier than the soliloquy" (p. 161 n. 4). 16 Windeatt, p. 43. Root was aware of this discrepancy, but he suggested that the J scribe moved the note to its present position ( Textual Tradition , p. 217). 17 It is possible that the J scribe was himself responsible for restoring the soliloquy, but if the scribal note is in his hand, as generally assumed, its position would seem to rule out the possibility; after copying the passage from another source, he would have been aware that there was no more matter "nat yt made." 18 The note may even postdate the copying of J; although generally assumed to be in the hand of the J scribe, the note is too short for the matter to be resolved conclusively. See Textual Tradition , p. 217; Richard Beadle and Jeremy Griffiths, in the Introduction to the facsimile of J, p. xxiv, reconfirm the usual view. 19 See the Middle English Dictionary , s.v. above ( n adv. 6(a) and adv. as adj. Owen, "The Question of Chaucer's Revisions," p. 162 n. 5, cites examples of Chaucer's use of "above" in this sense, the most significant of which occurs in a line of the Manciple's Tale, H 217: "But that the gentile, in estaat above." In a generally enthusiastic review of Windeatt's edition, C. David Benson also criticizes his interpretation of the line in question. See Studies in the Age of Chaucer , 8 (1986), p. 268. 20 Windeatt, p. 39. Owen objects strongly to Windeatt's characterization of Root's argument, and it is fair to say that Windeatt understates the tentative quality of Root's conclusions. 21 A much later hand has added the stanza in the margin in J; according to Beadle and Griffiths, this person "worked on the manuscript in or soon after 1602, the year in which Speght's second edition was published" ( St. John's College L.i: A Facsimile , p. xxiv). 22 The copy text here is Ph; the fifth and sixth lines have been emended from H4Th. 23 Hanna, in Editing Chaucer , p. 286 n. 8. Owen objects that "Such an epidemic of eyeskipping at a specific passage, if confirmed, would set some kind of record" ("The Question of Chaucer's Revisions," p. 169 n. 9), but it must be remembered that the manuscripts omitting the stanza fall into genetic groups (six of them in Book 1, according to Root's chart on p. 81 of Textual Tradition ), so that only a few instances of eye-skip could result in the omission of a passage from a large number of manuscripts. Furthermore, it is an accepted principle that the easier the scribal error the more likely it is to have occurred independently on more than one occasion. 24 See Textual Tradition , p. 34, and the note to the lines in Windeatt, p. 139. 25 H4, which has the stanzas in both positions, gives alpha/gamma readings in the first instance and beta readings in the second. 26 Root notes all instances of omission and transposition in his description of the manuscripts, Textual Tradition , pp. 3-31. There are only three cases of a shift of stanzas to a later position, apart from the one in question here: 2.29-42, 2 stanzas, occur after 2.49 in PhH2; 3.1779-1785, 1 stanza, after 3.1813 in Cx; and 2.953-980, four stanzas, after 2.1008 in H4. This last example is not noted in Windeatt's apparatus. 27 On the activity of the Troilus scribes, see the section of Windeatt's Introduction on "The Scribal Medium," pp. 25-35. 28 In an essay on "Mimetic form in the Central Love Scene of Troilus and Criseyde," Modern Philology , 67 (1969), pp. 125-132, Charles A. Owen, Jr., discusses the aesthetics of the shift, which he takes to be Chaucer's; see especially pp. 131-132. 29 Root based his opinion concerning the ultimacy of beta on examples of this sort. It remains to be considered why gamma, which most scholars other than Root take to represent Chaucer's final intentions, does not share in the suspected revision. 30 The copy text for alpha is Ph; there are some minor variations in both traditions of the text, none of which affects the question of revision. 31 The copy text here is J; Ph reverses "he" and "I." 32 George Kane, in Editing Chaucer , p. 208. 33 A possible exception is the prose Equatorie of the Planets , about which there is still scholarly disagreement; see D. J. Price, ed., The Equatorie of the Planetis , with a Linguistic Analysis by R. M. Wilson (1955). 34 The latter objection would apply even if the scribes could make use of the French prose translation of Beauvau. It should also be noted in this connection that, as far as we know, it was Thomas Tyrwhitt who in 1775 first observed that the Troilus was based on the Filostrato . 35 That Chaucer would not have revised his text to more closely approximate the Italian is only an assumption, but an entirely reasonable one supported by the principle of economy. Only Hanna seems to question this premise; in Editing Chaucer , p. 199, he objects that "poets may work this way, but it remains to be demonstrated that Chaucer worked so." 36 In the new Riverside Chaucer, Stephen Barney adopts a number of Italianate readings from alpha, in preference to the accepted reading of most other editions; see the discussions of 1.85, 3.1482, 3.1617, 4.37, 4.590, 4.596, 4.820, 4.882, and 4.1218 below. 37 Hanna, p. 199; Windeatt makes the same point on p. 43. 38 See William McCormick and Robert Root, eds., Specimen Extracts (Chaucer Society, First Series 89, 1914; rpt. New York: Johnson Reprint, 1967), Appendix pp. 63-72. 39 In the subsequent analysis, unless otherwise noted the comments of Windeatt are from the Commentary accompanying the text in his edition, and those of Root are from his line-by-line analysis in Textual Tradition . Unless otherwise noted, the basic text for the alpha readings is Ph, and the reading of the other manuscripts ( Rest ) follows Cp, as found in Windeatt. For each reading, selected variants are presented where these may have some bearing on the question of revision. 40 The reading Gret rumour gan is adopted in Barney's edition of the Troilus in the new Riverside Chaucer. 41 Among modern editors, only Barney adopts streyneth . 42 Barney, Windeatt, and Robinson emend to thus , as does Root, although presumably because this is the reading of beta. Fisher retains hym , the reading of his copy text. 43 Barney again adopts the alpha reading. 44 Barney emends to preciously . Note the R variant preciently , which must be a corruption of preciously and may therefore reflect contamination in the manuscript tradition. It should also be said that the earliest recorded use of preciously with the sense fastidiously comes nearly five centuries after the Troilus , although Chaucer did use the adjective with this sense. 45 PhGg's iape is an easy scribal error, due to the similarity of i and r in some hands. Barney again adopts the alpha reading. 46 Barney emends to shame . 47 Barney accepts the reading of αβ. 48 Barney adopts the alpha reading conforte . 49 See the Oxford English Dictionary , s.v. Rehete v 2 ., 1; the present instance is the earliest recorded and the only occurrence in the works of Chaucer, unless one includes Romaunt 6509, whose rehete , "comfort," is etymologically unrelated. 50 See Windeatt, p. 52 n. 10. Some of the examples cited in this note are so obviously scribal that they have not been treated here, e.g., the corruptions of the name Monesteo at 4.51. Among the more unconvincing instances considered above, Windeatt singles out 1.272, 1.483, and 4.1134. 51 Hanna, p. 202. Root did not seem to be aware of this inconsistency, though he readily admitted that his hypothesis could not be proven: "One cannot establish certainly the truth of the hypothesis just given; but one can assert with a high degree of probability that, if not precisely the processes assumed, something equivalent to them must have taken place" ( Textual Tradition , p. 258), an argument that comes close to being an appeal to ignorance. 52 See 5.1856-1862, where Chaucer appeals to moral Gower and philosophical Strode for their correction. There is no real evidence that Chaucer circulated the poem before some sort of official "publication," but the practice did exist and may have been a factor in the textual tradition of some medieval poems. 53 In fact, Root used all three designations, α, β, and γ, to represent both the manuscript groups and the authorial original that he took to be behind each of them; see the List of Abbreviations, Textual Tradition , p. xii: "α: the earliest, unrevised text, and collectively the MSS. which in any given passage present this text. β: the final, revised text, and collectively the MSS. which in any given passage present this text. γ: a lost MS. derived from the archetype before the revision was yet complete, and collectively the MSS. derived from this original . . . ." Root's failure to distinguish between the manuscript groups and their hypothetical archetypes led him into a number of questionable positions, including his willingness to regard as authorial any plausible variation characteristic of a particular group. 54 With regard to the Legend of Good Women , however, it should be noted that in a recent article George Kane has cast doubt on the authority of the G version; see "The Text of The Legend of Good Women in CUL MS Gg.4.27" in Middle English Studies Presented to Norman Davis in Honour of His Seventieth Birthday , ed. Douglas Gray and E. G. Stanley (1983), pp. 39-58. 55 In a limited sense, the same is true even in the case of texts surviving in holograph manuscripts; here the author acts as scribe, and the manuscript, while authoritative and presumably more carefully executed than mere scribal transcripts, is susceptible to the same sorts of copying errors. 56 Benson makes this point in his review of Windeatt's edition: "Both Windeatt and Root admit revision of some sort . . . . The dispute is about when Chaucer conceived of what all agree is the final version of Troilus : at the planning stage, as Windeatt would have it, only after a first version had been issued, as Root argued, or sometime in between? The question is probably impossible to answer absolutely" (p. 268).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Pynson's and Thynne's Editions of Chaucer's House of Fame by A. S. G. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thynne's edition of Chaucer's House of Fame in The Workes of Geffray Chaucer (1532) is the latest of the five substantive texts of this work. 1 It has been assumed that Thynne derives from Caxton's [1483] edition, the other substantive printed edition, and another unidentified source. 2 It is certainly true that Thynne used more than one source for his edition. But it seems open to question whether he actually used Caxton. It seems more probable that he used Pynson's [1526] edition of Chaucer's poem. The relationship between Caxton's edition of the House of Fame and Pynson's is extremely close. Among the substantive texts, Caxton contains about one hundred and seventy unique variants. Pynson has all but nine of these. And even Pynson's variations do little to lessen the evidence of his dependence on Caxton. Five correct manifest typographical errors in Caxton: at 136 Caxton reads fleyng for Pynson's fletyng ; at 169 dare for bare ; at 906 Tat for That ; at 1430 an for on ; at 1572 Iy [ sic ] for In . And one seems to correct a compositorial error in Caxton: at 1946 Caxton reads of for Pynson's on apparently under the influence of of in the same position in line 1945. 3 The remaining alteration Pynson made to Caxton's unique substantive readings are minor. Twice Pynson has made adjustments that are probably metrical: at 532 Caxton reads beholden against Pynson's beholde ; and at 2071 Caxton reads Alas against Pynson's als . At one point Pynson introduces a unique reading of his own: at 2077 Caxton reads endressyng while Pynson reads redressyng (Thynne reads encreasyng ). 4 With the exception of this last (and the reading at 136 for which Thynne has an entirely different line), in all the readings noted above where Pynson varies from Caxton he is followed by Thynne. There are also a number of points where Pynson introduces new readings of his own and these readings are also followed by Thynne. These agreements by Pynson and Thynne against Caxton demonstrate the direct dependence of Thynne's edition on Pynson rather than Caxton. The full list of these agreements which follows cites Caxton as the lemma, followed by the reading of Pynson and Thynne: 174. in al thys] all in 1091. o] om . 1095. poetical] potencyall 1488. wonder] wonders 1666. now] om. ; ben] shalbe 1698. certayn] surely 1780. famous] famed 1822. I no wyl] I nyll 2072. tydyng] tidynges All these readings are peculiar to Pynson and Thynne. Together with the textual evidence of Pynson's derivation from Caxton, they provide clear evidence that Thynne had to hand, not a copy of Caxton's original edition, but Pynson's reprint of it. The point does not affect our sense of Thynne's editorial activity. 5 But it is useful to identify precisely one of his source texts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Apart from the printed editions of Caxton and Thynne, the poem also appears in three earlier manuscripts: Bodleian Library Fairfax 16, Bodley 368 and Magdalene College, Cambridge Pepys 2006. 2 Cf. John Fyler in the textual introduction to his recent edition of the poem for The Riverside Chaucer , general ed. L. D. Benson (1987): "Th[ynne] derives from C[axton] but makes use of at least one other authority" (p. 1139). 3 It is, of course, conceivable that Pynson had access to a copy of Caxton's edition that had corrected these errors. For evidence of resetting among the surviving copies see C. F. Bühler, "Chaucer's 'House of Fame': Another Caxton Variant," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 42 (1948), 140-143. The evidence Bühler presents does not, however, involve any of the readings discussed above. 4 I am concerned here with Pynson's treatment of Caxton's unique variants. There are a few other points where Pynson does introduce other unique variants of his own other than those discussed below, which are not followed by Thynne, but they do not affect the present argument. Two are probably compositorial errors: at 1141 Pynson reads And where all other witnesses read Any ; and at 1424 Pynson reads of where all others read for (an error probably occasioned by of in the same position in line 1423). At 1568 Pynson regularizes syntax and metre by reading in the where all others have in . And at 1738 Pynson makes his contribution to a reading that gave all witnesses trouble: it reads hestes , Caxton and Pepys bestes , Fairfax and Bodley lestes and Thynne questes . Thynne could have corrected these from his additional source. 5 For a recent assessment of that achievement see James E. Blodgett, "William Thynne," in Editing Chaucer: The Great Tradition , ed. P. Ruggiers (1984), pp. 35-52.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Edition of John Lyly's Sappho and Phao (1584) by David Bevington *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Lyly's Sappho and Phao has not been edited often since its first publication in 1584. Nor, this essay will argue, has it ever been critically edited on the basis of the actual first quarto that should serve in this case as the proper copy-text. The quartos of 1584 and 1591, incorrectly identified (as we shall see) by R. Warwick Bond as Q1 and Q2, were followed by Edward Blount's edition of Six Court Comedies in 1632, essentially a reprint of 1591 with some added songs, and then by F. W. Fairholt's The Dramatic Works of John Lilly (London: John Russell Smith, 1858), derived from Blount. R. Warwick Bond undertook to reedit all of Lyly from original texts in The Complete Works of John Lyly , 3 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1902), but he based his text of Sappho and Phao on a single copy of a 1584 quarto in the British Museum (now the British Library). That copy-text now appears to have been the wrong choice. The extent of Bond's error has only slowly been discovered. The first edition of A Short Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland . . . 1475-1640 by Pollard and Redgrave, 1926, implicitly compounded Bond's mistake by assigning only one number, 17086, to the 1584 "Q1" of Bond's edition. W. W. Greg made an important discovery in his A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939) when he recognized that not one but two quartos were published in 1584. He gave the number 82a to the British Library copy (C. 34. d. 17) and the number 82b to another quarto, existing (as far as Greg knew) in two copies, one at the Huntington Library and one at the Library of Worcester College, Oxford (C2 def.). Greg listed a few sample variants, especially in the catchwords. Noting moreover that the speech prefixes are not indented in 82a except in the A gathering, whereas 82b extends the indenting of speech prefixes to the outer forme of B, Greg concluded that 82a (STC 17086) was the earlier quarto. Thus, although Greg identified two quartos in 1584, he implicitly confirmed Bond's choice of copy-text for his edition, even though Bond had consulted the British Library copy only. The second edition of the STC Catalogue, published in 1976, updated its information on the basis of Greg's discovery by assigning a new STC number, 17086.5, to Greg's 82b, by this time known also to exist in a third copy in the National Library of Scotland. (A supposed fourth copy of this quarto, reported in the National Union Catalogue for the United States to be located in the City University of New York, turns out only to be a photographic copy of the Huntington quarto.) Yet this edition of the STC catalogue once again accepted the assumed priority of 82a or 17086, even though Greg's discussion of the merits of the case had been necessarily very brief and assertive; Greg speaks only of the indented speech prefixes and of "other details" which he does not specify. This present essay will argue that Greg's ordering of the two 1584 quartos is incorrect, and that his 82b, or STC 17086.5, should be regarded as the first quarto and the appropriate copy-text for a critical edition. The Stationers' Register entry for Sappho and Phao in 1584 is as follows: 6 to Ap'lis Tho cadman. Yt is graunted vnto him y t if he gett y e cõmedie of sappho laufully alowed vnto him. Then noñe of this cũpanie shall Interrupt him to enioye yt vj d . [ in margin Lyllye in a later hand ] (Greg, Bibliography , I.6) Having undertaken to publish Campaspe in the same year without previous entry in the Stationers' Register, Thomas Cadman evidently decided to guarantee legal protection in his second venture with a Lyly play. The inclusion of Lyly's name in the entry, and the conditional nature of Cadman's obtaining license to publish the play in question, suggest (as with Campaspe ) a close involvement of the author in the publishing of his own play and a wish on Lyly's part to obtain a text of literary integrity. Certainly the play's first publication in 1584 resulted in a reliable text. This is true whether we regard 17086 or 17086.5 as the first quarto, for they are both carefully printed, and one is simply a reprint of the other. STC 17086.5 bears the following title page and colophon: Sapho and Phao, / Played beefore the / Queenes Maiestie on Shroue-/tewsday, by her Maiesties / Children, and the Boyes of Paules . / . . . Imprinted at London / for Thomas Cadman. / 1584. [Colophon] Imprinted at London by Tho- /mas Dawson, for Thomas Cadman. The other quarto, STC 17086, bears an identical title page (except, as Greg notes, that 17086.5 uses a swash capital in Boyes and a thick lead above the date 1584) but varies the colophon as follows: Imprinted at London by Thomas / Dawson, for Thomas Cadman. An examination of the headlines or running-titles (" Sapho and Phao "), in which I have been very substantially assisted by Paul Werstine, suggests that in 17086.5 one skeleton-forme was used for the inner and outer formes of BDF; there is, for example, a recurring swash P on BDF 2,3. A single skeleton-forme also appears to have been used for the inner and outer formes of ACE, but was rotated 180 degrees between the imposition of inner C and outer C; moreover, two of the headlines in it (one found on C3 and C4, another on C3 v and 4 v ) were interchanged between the imposition of outer E and inner E (where the first of these headlines appears on E1 v and E3, the other on E3 and E4 v ). The case for a single skeleton in 17086 for all formes is clear throughout A to D, after which there is considerable disruption. A swash capital P recurs on A3 v and A4 v and on BCD 1,2; a distinctive p in Sapho recurs on A4 and BCD 1 v ,2 v ; a spaced period is visible on BCD 3,4; another distinctive p in Sapho appears on B4 v and CD 3 v ,4 v ; and another headline, distinguished by yet another p in Sapho , appears on B3 v alone. This last unique headline strongly suggests that inner B was composed before outer B in 17086, since it appears singly and does not recur whereas the headline on B4 v is repeated in later gatherings. The three extant copies of 17086.5 appear to be identical, except for a torn page (C2-C2 v ) in the Worcester copy that obliterates the page signature, the catchword on C2, and several words of the text, and occasional variations among the copies in the darkness of the inking. A comma after "blind" in line 22 of E3 and a period after "common" in lines 14-15 of D2 that are present in the other copies appear to be missing in photographic copies of the Huntington quarto, but examination of the original shows the punctuation marks to be present though extremely faint. Similarly, the Scotland copy appears to lack a comma after "arowes" in line 9 of F2 in photographic copies, but the original shows a faint impression of what may well be a punctuation mark (and there are several other faint commas in the surrounding text). Such infrequent and isolated changes in punctuation would be unlikely in press correction in any case. The 17086.5 quartos are substantially identical. The physical similarities and differences between the two quartos plainly suggest that sales of the first quarto were sufficient to support a quick reprinting, one in which almost nothing essential was changed. Both quartos are printed in fours from A through G2, A1 v and G2 v being blank. The reprinting is page for page with only one slight variation in page content and catchword, as noted by Greg. (There are other occasional variants in the catchwords—e.g., " Phao " and " Sapho " on E1 v and E2 respectively are followed by a period in 17086, not in 17086.5, and others are noted by Greg— but only once does variation affect the contents of the page.) On A3, the catchword in 17086.5 appears to be "forge. What," although in fact only "What" is carried over to A3 v . 17086's catchword is "his." 17086.5 thus prints "with fire in his forge" as part of A3, whereas 17086 carries over "his forge" to A3 v . It is not easy to understand why 17086.5 would provide a two-word inaccurate catchword as it does if it were the reprint, since the printer's copy (17086) would have been perfectly clear and correct, and the 17086.5 compositor, printing A3 and A3 v on opposite formes rather than seriatim (as we have seen), could not have known in printing the A3 catchword that "forge. What" would follow, whereas this would be an easy thing to do in following manuscript copy. 17086's better version can thus be seen as a compositor's correction of a natural error in his 17086.5 copy. The reprint is generally line for line, except for the following passages: lines 4-10 of the spoken text on A3; the last line of that page and the first 4 lines on A3 v ; lines 3-4, 6-8, 11-12, and 17-18 on B1; lines 4-5 on B2 v ; the last four lines on C2; lines 24-25 on C4; lines 16-19 on F1; lines 9-10 on F2; the first two lines on F2 v ; lines 22-23 on F4; lines 6-8 and 10-11 on F4 v ; and lines 2-3 and 10-13 on G2, the final page containing "The Epilogue." This is a small percentage of the total. It is clear that the printer of the reprinted text, whether it be 17086 or 17086.5, was following the first quarto as his copy and wished generally to keep to its arrangement of lines, for, even when crowding requires him to depart from his copy in this respect, he repeatedly maneuvers his type to rejoin the lineation of his model and avoid relining a whole paragraph. The two quartos are similarly alike, as Greg notes of 17086, in generally indenting the second line of a short prose speech whenever the prose turnover is short enough not to result in a third line of text for the speech in question. Otherwise, speeches of two substantial lines or more are returned to the left margin below the speech prefix. The quartos are identical in this feature, and priority cannot be established on this basis. In a number of formal and nonsubstantive respects the two quartos are physically different. The printer of the second quarto uses different initials in every instance where they appear, on A2, A2 v , A3, and G2. Although the lace border decoration and groups of type ornaments on the title page are basically identical in the two quartos, 17086 provides a border along the bottom of A2 v to help fill a blank space below "The Prologue at the Court," and fills the space at the bottom of G2, after "The Epilogue," with a decorated border different from that on G2 in 17086.5 (made up, in fact, of units used in the center of the title page in both quartos). These differences do not help greatly in deciding which quarto was printed first. One might wonder why, if 17086.5 were printed second, it would choose to omit a decorated border on A2 v and why it would choose a decoration on G2 that differs in style from that of the title page; however, it is also possible to construct a scenario in which 17086.5, printed to meet unanticipated demand for a second edition, simply omitted some ornaments. 17086's decorated borders are of a piece and suggest an attempt to impose stylistic unity where previously it had been more lacking, but the typographical ornaments used to build the decorative border on G2 in 17086.5, though not exactly the same as those in the decorative border on the title page, are in fact identical with those of the units within the border on the title page. Each quarto has its own consistency of style in the use of ornaments. Some other differences are of no use in determining priority: 17086 is missing a page signature on B4 that is present in 17086.5; B4's catchword, " Phao ," is on the final line of text in 17086 whereas it is below the text and on the same line as the signature in 17086.5; on B2, line 21 and following, 17086.5 prints an Exeunt on the same line as the end of the scene's last speech whereas 17086 drops the stage direction to a new line; and so on. Other formal differences do tend, on the other hand, to support the argument that will be advanced here that the first quarto of 1584 is in fact 17086.5 and not the British Library's 17086. One such difference, having to do with indented speech prefixes, is, as we have seen, noted by Greg but is used by him to advance the opposite theory of the priority of 17086. The facts are as follows. Both compositors begin with indented speech prefixes in the first gathering, on A3 v , A4, and A4 v . (There are no speech prefixes previously in the text except for one on A3 that, because of an initial, cannot readily be indented.) The 17086.5 compositor then carries the practice of indentation of speech prefixes on into what Greg assumed was the first-set forme (the outer forme) of his second gathering, on B1, B4 v , and B2 v -B3, all of these pages lying on one side of a single printing sheet, and then chooses not to indent speech prefixes on B1 v , B2, B3 v , B4, and throughout the rest of the play. The 17086 compositor's practice is identical with that of 17086.5 for the first gathering, but he then regularizes to unindented speech prefixes for the rest of the play. Greg implies that the 17086.5 compositor resisted the change he found in his copy for a time but then yielded to its example in the second (inner) forme of B. Yet Greg's argument is eminently reversible. If the 17086.5 compositor went first, inconsistently setting one forme with indented speech prefixes as he had done in gathering A and the other with unindented speech prefixes (perhaps because of something unclear or inconsistent in his manuscript copy), then the printer's copy for 17086 would have appeared to be a muddle. The B gatherings of both quartos appear to have been set by formes, but the printer's copy for the second quarto was presumably the earlier quarto, its pages arranged in numerical sequence. It is easy to suppose that the 17086 compositor, seeing that his copy for the B gathering inconsistently interspersed indented and unindented pages, proceeded to remedy an inconsistency he could not explain. Especially if he started with the inner forme in setting B—and Werstine's analysis of headlines and skeleton-formes above strongly suggests that he did—this compositor may have followed his copy (17086.5), noting that the speech prefixes were now unindented, and then, moving on to the outer forme and finding the speech prefixes in his copy indented, decided in favor of unindented consistency. The 17086.5 compositor, printing first, may have composed his outer forme first, continuing in it the practice of indented speech prefixes, after which, for some reason, he shifted to unindented speech prefixes. This hypothesis is more logical than the reverse, to suppose that the 17086.5 compositor might have followed indented speech prefixes from his copy in the A gathering and then, faced with consistently indented speech prefixes throughout the B gathering in his copy, chose to indent on one side of the sheet and not on the other. (Compare the first two quartos of Hamlet , where we can see that at the beginning Q2 [sigs. B1-B1 v ] must have been set from an annotated copy of Q1 since both texts begin with speech prefixes that are flush with the margin and then shift to indented speech prefixes at the same point in the text [" Hora. Tush, tush, twill not appeare"] but at a point where Q1 begins a new page [B1 v ], whereas the longer Q2 text is a third of the way down the second page when the shift occurs.) 1 A comparison of the two quartos in their use of periods after speech prefixes is easier to explain if 17086 is the reprinted text. In the A gathering, 17086.5 is somewhat inconsistent but tends toward distinguishing between periods after abbreviated speech prefixes and none after unabbreviated ones. 17086 meantime consistently prefers a period in all cases. Gathering B continues 17086.5's inconsistency, so much so that it is hard to say whether the text is distinguishing between abbreviated and unabbreviated speech prefixes (as on B2 v and B3) or preferring periods in all cases (as on B3 v and B4). Some pages in gathering B (1 v , 2) mix the use of periods and no periods after unabbreviated speech prefixes. 17086 meantime also hesitates and mixes forms on the same page (e.g., B1 v , B2, B3, and B4). In gatherings C and D, 17086.5's preference is by now clear in favor of periods after all speech prefixes, while 17086 opts in most cases, especially on the inner or second forme, for distinguishing between abbreviated (with periods) and unabbreviated (without periods) speech prefixes (though there are exceptions on C1, C1 v , D2, and D3). Beginning with E1 and continuing to the end of the play, 17086.5 is entirely consistent in affixing periods after both abbreviated and unabbreviated speech prefixes, while 17086 follows a similar practice of affixing periods in all cases (but with exceptions on E1 and F3). Since the practice that is ultimately adopted by both, to provide periods in all instances, is consistently adopted by 17086.5 nearly two whole gatherings earlier than 17086, it appears more likely that 17086 yielded to following copy at the start of gathering E rather than that 17086.5, having preferred periods in all cases, suddenly found his copy conforming to the practice he had already settled on. The pattern in both quartos militates against a theory of two compositors, since there is no discernible shifting back and forth between the A, C, E, G gatherings and the B, D, F gatherings. The forms of abbreviation in speech prefixes suggest a sporadic effort on the 17086 compositor's part to regularize the greater variety in 17086.5. (The text is a "literary" one throughout, with characters' names grouped at the heading of each scene, with sparse stage directions, and with little evidence of playhouse practice or prompt-book regularization.) The useful speech prefixes to watch in this regard are Trachinus ( Trach. , Trachi. ), Mileta ( Mile. , Milet. , Mileta. ), Criticus or Cryticus ( Criti. , Cryti. ), and Calypho ( Caly. , Cali. ). Sybilla is sometimes abbreviated ( Syl. ), and Lamia is also spelled Lamya . In Act 3, scene 3, for example, the 17086.5 compositor generally uses Milet. as he has done previously for Mileta but prints Mil. at ll. 54 and 77 and Mile. at l. 79; 17086 prints Milet. or Milet in these instances, though he also spells out Mileta once at l. 89. 2 In the following scene as well, Act 3, scene 4 (mislabeled "Actus terius, Schaena prima" in 17086.5 and "Actus tertius, Schaena prima" in 17086), 17086 again offers a consistent reading of Milet. at ll. 38 and 40 where 17086.5 reads Mile. None of these instances shows evidence of crowding as a constraint on the use of a longer form; the lines are normally set, even loose. It would be hard to explain why the 17086.5 compositor arbitrarily switched to Mil. and Mile. if the more consistent text of 17086 were his copy. Of course the author's papers may have been irregular to begin with, but that possibility renders even less likely the hypothesis that 17086 applied a consistency to his copy which 17086.5 then proceeded haphazardly to undo. In Act 1, scene 2, the 17086.5 compositor begins with Trachi. in line 1 but immediately switches to Trach. for the remainder of the scene except for another Trachi. at l. 70; the 17086 compositor prints Trachi. at l. 6, Trachinus's second speech, as though following the precedent established in l. 1, and only thereafter switches to Trach. Later, at l. 70, he prints Trachi. as does 17086.5. The hypothesis of 17086 as the second printer supposes that the compositor was attempting to regularize at first but then gave it up and followed his copy, whereas the reverse hypothesis must suppose that the 17086.5 compositor saw that his copy was going to shift to Trach. and so decided to anticipate that move at l. 6—a less plausible supposition. Similarly, in Act 1, scene 4, 17086.5 inconsistently shifts from Lamia in the opening stage direction to Lamya for her first speech prefix, whereas the 17086 compositor corrects the speech prefix on the basis of the stage direction. Such a change is easier to explain by postulating the 17086 compositor as the printer of the second quarto than by the reverse hypothesis. The 17086.5 compositor could have ignored a consistent spelling of Lamia in his copy and produced Lamya out of nowhere, but it would have been arbitrary for him to do so whereas the 17086 compositor's revision is entirely plausible and consistent with the other attempts on his part to regularize. Spelling preferences reinforce the hypothesis that the 17086 compositor printed the second quarto. When we consider the spelling variants, that is, words spelled one way in 17086.5 and another way in 17086, we can see that one compositor set each text throughout and that the two compositors had distinctive spelling preferences. The 17086.5 compositor has a marked tendency to add a final -e to words like whome , sweete , howe , woulde , paye , indeede , thinke , witte , foule , and so on. All these words are printed by the 17086 compositor with no final -e , and they appear in roughly equal distribution in outer and inner formes. There are, by a rough count, 42 occurrences of a term thus spelled without the final -e in 17086, and only 16 instances of contrary evidence in which the 17086 compositor chooses to spell with a final -e a word that the 17086.5 spelled without. When we consult the text for spellings common to both editions, we find the added -e everywhere: stinge , behinde , finde , heale , and so on. The likeliest hypothesis, then, is that the 17086 compositor, finding the final -e in his copy as a general rule and staying close to his copy in most matters, imposed his spelling preference sporadically but in enough instances to be statistically significant. The reverse hypothesis has to allow for a more random procedure on the part of the 17086.5 compositor or the author, one that generated a text with no consistency in this kind of spelling. Such an inconsistency is possible, and indeed the 17086 compositor occasionally chooses the final -e spelling against his usual habit, but probability inclines to the hypothesis that the author and/or the first compositor had one kind of consistency (favoring final -e ) whereas the second compositor's spelling habits (favoring no final -e ) ran counter to what he found in his copy. The case is even stronger for 17086.5's preference for a final -ie in place of -y : readie , enemie , pollicie , studie , bewtie , ferrie , etc., all changed to ready , enemy , and the like. Here again the common spellings show a marked preference for the -ie ending and suggest that the 17086 compositor is at times imposing his preference rather than the reverse. There are 25 instances where -ie in 17086.5 reads -y in 17086, none in the other direction. Spelling preferences are not as conclusive evidence as other sorts offered in this essay, and one can construct a scenario in which 17086.5 tried to regularize the mixed spellings he found in 17086, which could in turn have been found in the manuscript copy, but such a hypothesis begins by assuming that the 17086 compositor haphazardly vacillated between -y and -ie or was following arbitrary spellings in his manuscript copy, whereas the hypothesis that 17086 came second assumes that the 17086.5 compositor and/or author had a predilection for one spelling ( -ie ) whereas the 17086 compositor had a predilection for another spelling ( -y ), one at variance with his copy. The statistics on the spelling of stinges , lockes , kissinges , thinges , wordes (the common spelling in many instances, and 17086.5's preference when the two texts vary) as opposed to stings , locks , kissings , and the like (appearing almost exclusively in 17086) are virtually as onesided: 22 cases where 17086 prefers -s to -es , and only two in the other direction. Because the common spellings in the Prologue (for example) show a marked preference for meaninges , mirthes , fooles , habites , eares , reportes , cheekes , etc., the spelling evidence tends to support the hypothesis of 17086 as the reviser on the grounds already cited in the previous paragraph, granted again that spelling preferences are not as conclusive as some other kinds of evidence. In any case, the spelling preferences of both quartos are common to inner and outer formes and to all gatherings, strongly suggesting a single compositor for each quarto. Another onesided statistic has to do with ampersands in place of "and." The 17086.5 compositor prefers "and" where 17086 chooses the ampersand 21 times; the reverse is true only three times. Ampersands are fairly common in both texts and are found jointly in 24 instances, but 17086's augmentation of the number is still large as a percentage. Examination of individual instances points to a conclusion that is borne out in other ways as well: if we assume that the 17086 compositor is printing the second quarto, then we can hypothesize that he often finds his lines crowded when he attempts to follow his 17086.5 copy virtually line by line but in a more generous sized type (albeit in a wider column width). Reasonably clear examples are at 1.3.30, 1.4.48, 2.1.134, and 2.3.87; and there are others. When on the other hand the 17086 compositor changes from ampersand to "and," as at 1.1.2, he does so where the line in 17086.5 is loosely composed or where (as in this instance) the providing of a new initial has given the compositor a wider column width beside the capital. This evidence is reversible in individual cases (i.e., to suppose that the 17086.5 compositor had to work with more cramped space beside initials), but it is less reversible in the numerous cases not involving initials, where we would have to assume that the 17086.5 compositor, finding ampersands in his copy text, repeatedly chose to spell out "and" despite his working with a narrower column width (and smaller type, to be sure); the lines hypothetically thus produced in 17086.5 are all quite crowded and seem like odd places for the compositor to have insisted on spelling out a word that both texts are content to abbreviate elsewhere. Cumulatively, this evidence is consistent with a hypothesis of 17086 as the reviser. The 17086.5 compositor is somewhat less likely than the 17086 compositor to use the tilde over a vowel for the nasal, as in vppõ , the͂ , cã , heaue͂ , and the like, though 17086 also spells out some words that are abbreviated thus in 17086.5. Individual cases show space considerations at work, as in 1.3.30 ( me͂ ), 2.1.119 ( cõsume ), and elsewhere. Spellings of certain distinctive words confirm 17086's role as printer of the second quarto. In Act 2, scene 3, for example, 17086.5 is generally consistent in the spelling of deuill and deuilles ; it appears thus eight times, although once as deuil and once as deuils. 17086 clearly prefers diuell , for he spells it thus in the first three instances, and subsequently has diuelles , diuels , and diuell . Beginning with the word's fourth appearance, however, he vacillates, printing deuill twice and deuil once, mingled among his preferred spellings. Each of these departures from his preference exactly reproduces the spelling in 17086.5. 17086 is influenced by 17086.5 in this regard not only in the matter of eui - iue but also in whether to double the consonantal ending or not, capitulating to 17086.5's somewhat random choice of -l or -ll . This last point is reversible as evidence, since the two texts are identical in their choice of doubling the consonantal endings, but the hypothesis of 17086.5 as a second printer does not explain why 17086 would have been so random in the first place and why 17086.5 would then have regularized to deuill in regard to the vowels but followed 17086 in the matter of final consonants. One small but telling bit of evidence, pointed out to me by Eric Rasmussen, is that an apparently stray mark on C2 v of 17086.5 between lines 14 and 15, caused perhaps by a space that has worked up, is converted by the 17086 compositor into an unnecessary and intrusive comma. The evidence is of the mechanical sort that enabled W. W. Greg to determine the priority of nearly identical editions of The Elder Brother . 3 Concluding then that the 17086 compositor set the second edition, Q2 (not to be confused with Bond's Q2, dating from 1591), we have in the Q2 compositor a workman who makes relatively few errors. "Teech" for "teeth" in 2.1.101 is an obvious misprint; "Kanope" for "Canope" in the opening stage direction of 3.3 is an unexplained vagary; a comma at the end of "Actus secundus, Schaena prima," is inconsistent with his usual format; punctuation omissions are sometimes a clear lack of improvement (as in 2.1.28, "Lady nothing . . ." or 2.1.35, "No I may not obtein but . . ."); and the like. On the whole, though, the Q2 compositor is conscientious and accurate. Bond's reliance on Q2 as though it were Q1 for his copy-text has hitherto not introduced many difficulties for a modernized text, though it does to be sure make for very numerous inaccuracies in his old-spelling edition. There are finally some readings in which a substantive difference occurs, and so we come to the central question as to whether the Q2 compositor had access to any reliable authority for the few such changes that do occur. A survey of the substantive variants in the order in which they appear reveals evidence of several errors (quite a tolerable percentage) but also of some persuasive new readings. As an example of manifest error, the Q2 compositor fails to correct Q1's "needelesse" in the Prologue at the Court, l. 9; a needed change to "needle's" had to await Q3 of 1591. (This is of course not a Q1/Q2 variant.) On the other hand, the correction at 1.2.73 of Q1's "And you sir boyes" to Q2's "And you sir boy" is clearly justified, though "boy" is not, as Bond supposed, a Q1 reading that was misprinted as "boyes" in what he calls Q2 (1591); instead, it looks like a sensible guess that any good compositor could have made. At 1.3.2, Q2's "the diet" for Q1's "thy diet" looks like either a misprint or an astute guess based on the assumption that there ought to be a Lylyan antithesis between "thy commons in Athens" and "the diet at court," one representing a scholar's life and one a page's; "the" is followed by Bond in the mistaken impression that it represents the original reading. A closer examination reveals, however, that Q1's reading is right after all, since in his reply Molus refers to both diets as his own: "there of a little I had somewhat, here of a great deal nothing." Q2's "wordlings" for "worldlings" at 1.3.22 is a plain error, mistakenly preserved by Bond. So is the omission of the word "it" at 1.4.6 (silently supplied by Bond without a textual note). Q2 repeats an incorrect speech prefix, Sapho instead of Phao , at 2.1.60. Q2's "vine" for Q1's "vines" at 2.1.142 is clearly an error, though preserved by Bond. So is "in" for "is" at 2.2.2, treated by Bond as an emendation. Q2's "hearken" for "yearken" at 2.1.30, on the other hand, is the simple correction of a misprint (missed as such by Bond, since he assumed "hearken" to be the original reading). Q2's "Wilt thou forsake the ferrie" for Q1's "Wilt thou forsake thy ferrie" at 2.2.25, though preserved by Bond as the presumed Q1 reading even if "thy" in the later texts must have seemed attractive to him, is clearly a misprint in Q2. Q2's printing of "a" for Q1's "an" at 2.3.24 cannot be justified, though it is followed by Bond. All the instances thus far plainly suggest, moreover, that Q3 (1591) follows Q1 for its copy, since it retains the error of "boyes" along with the correct original reading of "worldlings," "vines," "is," and "an," and the two correct original readings of "thy." Q2's substitution of "lesse" for Q1's "losse" at 2.4.74 is plausible, though Bond is wrong in ascribing it to the original text; it reads like a compositor's commonsense emendation, especially in view of the fact that Q1 has a typographical error two words earlier in the same line ("requirerh"). Paleographically, the confusion from similarity of letter formation is an evidence for the error "losse" having been set. Again, Q3 follows the error of Q1. In 3.1.30, Q2's "weane" is an astute emendation of Q1's "weaue" (not recorded by Bond), but not beyond a compositor's capability in that the metaphor is plainly discernible in "noursed" in the same line. At 3.2.47, Bond's choice of Q2's "being holde" is clearly misinformed; the phrase is "being holden," not only more idiomatic but the authentic reading of Q1 and followed by Q3. Some Q2 readings are good enough to raise momentarily the possibility of independent authority. "Boy," "losse," and "weane" are fine emendations, if commonsensical. The emendation of Q1's "crooked" to Q2's "croked" at 3.3.64 is also perhaps self-explanatory since it follows the word "Rauen." (Bond does not record this, though Q3 follows Q1's "crooked.") The Q2 reading of "reare me vp, my bed, my head" at 3.3.84-5 for Q1's "reare me vp, my bead, my head" is interesting and probably correct, using "me" to mean "for me," but bead is a most unusual form for bed (not in OED ) while it is an easy misprint for head , and the sentence as a whole could possibly be intended to read, "reare me vp, my head, my head lies too low," as indeed its punctuation in Q1 and Q2 suggests. More likely, the compositor of Q1, memorizing his line as he set, was influenced by "head" and produced the unusual spelling "bead" accordingly. The Q2 reading of "hearte" for Q1's "heate" at 3.3.107 is, on the other hand, more complex. The whole phrase, "and thou Phoebus that in the pride of thy heate shinest all daye in our Horizon" (so printed in Q1) might support "heate" or "hearte." Is the Q2 compositor guessing, and if so do we go along with him or print "heate" as did Q3 and subsequent texts (except Bond, who believes he is following the original copy in "hearte")? In any case, as we shall see, this and "my bed" at l. 85 are the only serious candidates for independent authority in all the substantive variants of this play, and since "heate" can so adequately be explained as a compositor's guess (probably unnecessary), there is finally no reason to suppose that Q2 had access to any other authority than Q1. Conceivably Q2's guess is right here, since "pride of thy heart" is such a recognizable phrase and since "heate" is such an easy misprint for "hearte," but a conservative choice by an editor would be understandable. Q2's emendation of "binde" to "blinde" at 3.4.11 is possible but unnecessary; it seems at best a plausible word in a speech about the delight of beauty to the senses, and "binde" could be an easy misprint for "blinde," but the change may instead be a printer's sophistication, since "binde" looks forward in the same sentence to the image of being rocked to sleep as if bound up in swaddling bands. Q2 fails to correct an error in the speech prefix at 3.4.39: Q1's Sapho should clearly read Phao (though unrecorded by Bond). Nothing can support Q2's "sight" (twice) for "sighe" and "sigh" at 3.4.76 and 80, despite Bond's attempts to rationalize what he takes to be the original reading; possibly "sight" is Q2's spelling variant ( OED allows it as such); since Q2 also prints "sighe" in this same sentence, it appears that "sight" in the first instance is either a simple misprint for "sighe," after which the Q2 compositor changed "sigh" to "sight" in an attempt to be consistent with what he had begun, or the sporadic result of his choosing a somewhat idiosyncratic spelling against the preference of his copy. Q2's "one" for "on" at 4.3.13 is clearly a misprint, erroneously preserved by Bond. At 4.3.43, Q2's "the best friend with the tatling" makes things worse than Q1's "the best friend with thy tatling"; the phrase should read "thy best friend with thy tatling," and Q2's "correction" may represent a bungled attempt to emend what he found in his copy. Q2's "ouerwatching" for Q1's "ourwatching" at 4.3.58 is, on the other hand, a plausible emendation, even if "ourwatching" can be made to work by dividing it into two words or regarding it as a variant spelling of or printing error for "o'erwatching." But Q2's "though" for Q1's "thought" at 4.3.72 is a simple misprint. So is Q2's "women" for Q1's "womens" at 4.3.96. At 4.4.28, Q2's "one his heart," followed mistakenly by Bond, is a simple misprint for Q1's "on his heart." In 5.1, Q2 is probably intrusive in emending Q1's "mistake it not" to "mistake me not" at line 21; the need for the change is not obvious. Q2 normalizes "Swite" (cf. OED "swiete" etc.) to "Sweete" earlier in line 21 (an excellent example to confirm the order of the Qq.). In the following scene he misprints Q1's "Mee thinkes" as "My thinkes" at line 3. His rendition of Q1's "withdrawing" in line 4 as "withstanding" is interesting, and might merit serious consideration if this were the original text (and of course Bond prints "withstanding"); but Q1's phrase, "as it were a withdrawing in my self," is plainly so intelligible and right that Q2's attempt has to be regarded as some kind of aberration and not based on any reliable authority. In summary, all the worthy emendations in Q2, of which there are several, can be explained as the work of a conscientious compositor, such as the Q2 compositor appears to be from other evidence presented here. The number of errors in Q2, including such entirely characteristic errors as the for thy (twice), tends to support the overall conclusion of this essay that 17086 is in fact the second quarto, since texts continuously degenerate in transmission, even if it must be emphasized that the discussion here of editorial decisions does not bear primarily on the earlier question of establishing priority; the evidence presented earlier is of a more conclusive sort. The compositor who set Q2 worked intelligently and has left no implausible emendations directly traceable to error. The possibility that he was working with a marked copy or corrected proofs seems minimized by the sparsity of the positive corrections and their commonsense quality. We have no reason to follow Q2 except where the emendations are self-justifying. The subsequent printings of Sappho and Phao produced no new textual authority. We have already sampled above the plentiful evidence that Q3 (STC 17087; Bond's Q2), printed by William Broome in 1591 (although with no record of transfer in the Stationers' Register), is a reprint of Q1 without recourse to Q2. The pagination is identical with that of Q1. A colophon is lacking. Other changes are confined to routine printer's errors in a page by page and line by line reprint from Q1, along with some arbitrary editorial changes such as the following: "the Theater of Athens" for "the Theater at Athens" in "The Prologue at the Blackfriars," l. 12, "which" for "that" in "The Prologue at Court," l. 10, "glaunce at others faces" for "glaunce on others faces" at 2.1.99, "will I" for "I will" at 2.1.127, "a deuill" for "the deuill" at 2.3.50, "Be they all deuilles that haue hornes" for "Be they all deuilles haue hornes" at 2.3.70, "it is" for "is it" at 3.2.11, "gyue your selfe leaue to slumber" for "gyue your selfe to slumber" at 3.3.32, and "to be imaginatiue" for "to be the imaginatiue" at 4.3.49. None of these emendations is more than uninspired guesswork or stylistic "improvement," and cumulatively they provide no evidence of authorial intervention. As in the case of Q4 of Campaspe in the same year, the transfer of the play to Broome seems not to have involved Lyly. Edward Blount's Six Court Comedies of 1632 (STC 17088) is simply a reprint from Q3 with minor changes except for the addition of the songs. Typical of readings that show the dependency of the 1632 reprint on Q3 are the following: Prologue at the Blackfriars, l. 12, at Q1-2 , of Q3-Bl. ; l. 17, bee from Q1-2 , bee free from Q3 , be free from Bl. ; II.i.65, read Q1-2 , red Q3-Bl. ; II.i.67, waxed Q1-2 , wexed Q3-Bl. ; II.i.77, suckered Q1-2 , succored Q3 , succoured Bl. ; II.i.99, on Q1-2 , at Q3-Bl. , etc. Blount's major contribution was to provide songs to the plays where in quarto they had only been indicated by stage directions. The issue as to whether to include the songs in a critical edition of Lyly's play has been much debated by G. K. Hunter, W. W. Greg, John Robert Moore, and M. R. Best, among others, 4 and is in any case another story. Apart from that issue, the editorial implications of this textual history of Sappho and Phao seem clear. Q1 is the authoritative text. Even if one should normally be on the lookout for priority in the latest edition to appear in the author's lifetime, Lyly seems to have had nothing to do with the minor changes successively introduced into Q2 and Q3. The Blount edition of 1632, appearing after Lyly's death in 1606, seems also to record no corrections or additions (other than the songs) that might have been left by him, though it, like Q3 and especially Q2, does introduce a few sensible emendations that commend themselves to the editor.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Abraham Fleming: A Learned Corrector in 1586-87 by Elizabeth Story Donno</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Textual investigators are increasingly coming to acknowledge the role of an in-house proofreader or an outside "learned corrector" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; given the emphasis on the importance of the function in two seventeenth-century manuals—one from the continent and one from England—such acknowledgement is perhaps somewhat tardy. In his Orthotypographia (Leipzig 1608), Hieronymous Hornschuch says that a corrector is bound to check everything two or three times, while in his Mechanic Exercises (1683-84) Joseph Moxon calls for a second and sometimes a third proof before the forme goes to press; this is followed by a "review" (or revise). 1 Though these injunctions have at times been claimed as archetypal rather than practical, they would seem in fact to reflect something of current practice as interpreted by Donald F. McKenzie in his provocative article "Printers of the Mind" and by Peter Blayney in his study The Texts of King Lear and their Origins . 2 Although the size and affluence of the printing house were clearly determinants in the employment of proof correctors, a most important one was the nature of the subject matter, if legal, theological, or Holy Writ. When Bishops Sandys, for example, was appointed to prepare the Bishops' Bible, he recommended that the text be diligently surveyed by well-learned men before printing began and that skilful and diligent correctors attend while it was being printed; for the printing of the Geneva Bible a few years later, the Queen's printer Christopher Barker declared that he had retained three learned men as correctors. 3 These instances of course relate to perhaps the most important text for the period, but what was the extent of proof correcting for other important but not sacrosanct texts? The concern of this essay is with an example of the second sort. Instances of marked proof thought to represent different stages of correction have been discovered, among them the page from Antony and Cleopatra —well known because of its inadvertent inclusion in a copy of the first Shakespeare Folio—with its seventeen marked and two unmarked errors; this, McKenzie has observed, may represent a revise since the earlier stages would have been the least likely to survive. David Foxon has called attention to a later instance—the separate proofsheets of William Cartwright's Royall Slave (1639, 1640), which, in their freedom from obvious error, he suggested, may represent "second proofs," and Blayney has referred to other examples of single proof-sheets, frequently printer's waste, ranging in date from 1526 to 1625. 4 Recently the Huntington Library has obtained a much more extensive and impressive example from the sixteenth century: two bound copies of proofsheets of Holinshed's Chronicles published in 1587 in three volumes. This second edition expanded and brought up to date matters relating to Ireland, Scotland, and England, some of which were of great concern to the government as evidenced by the castrations to which it was subjected by the Privy Council and/or their examiners. 5 Published by a syndicate of London printer-publishers—John Harrison, George Bishop, Ralph Newberrie, Henry Denham, and Thomas Woodcock, the first two of whom had been members of the initial three-man syndicate that published the original edition in two volumes ten years earlier—it undoubtedly involved an enormous expenditure. 6 When entry was made in the Stationers' Register in 1584, two of the members of the syndicate—Bishop and Newberrie—were serving as wardens. Added, then, to the political importance the government attached to the texts was its financial importance to the five printers subsidizing the venture; for the reading public its importance lay in its registering the history of the nation in "perpetuall memorie" (or "infamie") as the Scots presbyterians were quick to point out in their objections to the including of certain matters (Donno, "Some Aspects," pp. 233-238). According to the title page, editorial credit is given to John ap Vowell "and others," but it has been recognized for some time that it was Abraham Fleming who served as the general editor, with Vowell contributing to the Irish history, Francis Thynne to the Scots, and Stow to the English; due recognition is given to them by initials or names within the text and to other various contributors. 7 In addition to his editorial duties of compiling and organizing the texts, Fleming had other duties equally onerous; they include the extensive indices that he prepared for the three volumes (apart from the contributions on Ireland by Vowell who himself indexed these); the careful proofreading of the texts, certainly for the first two volumes as will be demonstrated below, and in part for Volume 3, where several hands were at work; finally, the necessary splicing and substitution of materials as a result of official scrutiny. How the marked proofsheets came to be preserved is something of a mystery; the most likely explanation is that it was Fleming himself, who, having "sweated mightily" in correcting and expanding the text (as Thynne puts it in his bibliography of sources), kept them as a testament to his manifold efforts. 8 Little biographical information has come to light about proof correctors in Elizabethan London, leaving the twentieth-century student with only a vague sense that they were probably "learned" and willing or unwilling accessories to litigation. On the basis of two Chancery suits, Percy Simpson was able to specify the names at least of three: Richard Day, a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, who worked for his printer father from 1576 to 1579, replacing one William Gace, and Robert Hewes of London who was working as a press corrector for Henry Middleton in 1587. 9 With Fleming, the case is different. For more than a decade preceding the publication of the Holinshed he was involved with at least fifteen printing houses in a variety of capacities: as poet, translator, editor, "gatherer," i.e. compiler, indexer, and finally as learned corrector, and a sharp sense of his personal predilections emerges from his printed comments. These are a pronounced religious fervor, a sense of intellectual superiority, and a truculent mode of expression. During this period (drab though it seemed to C. S. Lewis and may seem to us), the literary efforts of writers like Barnabe Googe, Arthur Golding, Timothy Kendall, George Whetstone, Reginald Scot, as well as Fleming himself, contributed to developing a broad reading audience to the economic benefit of printer and publisher alike. Fleming's commendatory verses to their works indicate that he was very much in touch with the London literary scene in the 1570's and '80's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II "Londoner borne," as he was to specify a number of times in works published from 1582 on, Fleming had gone up to Cambridge in 1570 where his brother Samuel had preceded him, having entered King's (from Eton) five years earlier at the age of seventeen. From the date on his epitaph which Fleming himself composed, he, too, would have been either seventeen or eighteen years old when he became a sizar at Peterhouse. 10 Even though he was not to receive his degree until 1581-82, he had been looking to a career in London publishing even earlier since his first two publications identify him as "student." In the dedication to the first of these, a translation of the Bucolics of Virgil ( STC 2 24816, 1575) into "plaine and familiar . . . verse," i.e. riming fourteeners, which was accompanied by alphabetical annotations, he complains that the "printer" was sparing of cost—"coveting to compasse much with little charge"—and in such haste to have the work dispatched that he lightly regarded what he, Fleming, "by tossing, tumbling, and ruffling divers authors to and fro" had collected and assembled (A3). The printer was John Charlewood, the publisher Thomas Woodcocke, later a member of the Holinshed syndicate. Despite such sparing of cost, Fleming puffs the practical value of the publication, specifying as one of its advantages "a mitigation of expence, or (that I may speake more familiarly) a saving of money," this on the grounds of the inclusion of an abridged "dictionary" which by itself would exceed the price of "this libell by pence, groates, and shillings" (A4). Both dedication and address to the reader are signed "Abraham Fleming, Student." After listing the errors to be corrected, Fleming moderates his tone in requesting the gentle reader to mark and amend those that have escaped the translator's pen, the compositor's hand, the corrector's eye, and the printer's press, a clear indication that the work had been proofed either by the translator himself or someone in the printing house. He ends his text with the statement in Latin that it was a work of fourteen days during left-over and stolen hours, a statement made perhaps in emulation of Thomas Phaer who had been careful to specify the number of days required for each book of his translation of the Aeneid (1558), for example, Book 2: Opus viginti dierum ; Book 4: Opus quindecim dierum , etc. Curiously, Fleming published another version of the Bucolics at the very end of his secular career, this time "not in foolish rime (the nice observation whereof many times darkeneth, corrupteth, perverteth, and falsifieth both the sense and the signification) but in due proportion and measure" (A4 v ). And he continues, "As for envie I defie it; and to find faults I wish silence, whose only worke it is to barke at other mens painfull labours . . . ." This appeared in 1589, together with a translation of the Georgics (or Rurals, STC 2 24817), both dedicated to Archbishop Whitgift; the publisher again was Thomas Woodcocke. In the second dedication Fleming roundly asserts that he cares not for the curious and malicious: "both being persons swift to prejudicate, but slow to deliberate; ripe to deface and discountenance, but rawe to correct or imitate the commendable travels of well affected Students" (A2). The conclusion of the text reads FINIS propositi, laus Christo nescia FINIS , which as will appear later served as his personal mode of identification during the last six years of his career in London publishing. His second publication as a student (1576) was also a translation, a "pamphlet or skantling," i.e. an abridgement of John Caius's treatise on English dogs. Concluding his address to the "well disposed Reader" comes this somewhat churlish statement: "As for such as shall snarr and snatch at the Englishe abridgement, and teare the Translatour, being absent, with the teeth of spightfull envye, I conclude in brevity their eloquence is but currishe[;] if I serve in their meate with wrong sawce, ascribe it not to unskilfulnesse in coquery, but to ignoraunce in their diet. . . . His and his Friendes, Abraham Fleming" ( STC 2 4347). The printer and publisher was Richard Jones, who according to McKerrow's Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers was on the whole an orderly member of the Stationers' Company and had a long career. 11 At this date he seems not to have had a complete Greek fount, for after the alphabetical index, the first of many Fleming was to compile, comes the listing of four errors to be corrected, followed by the explanatory remark, "There bee also certaine Accents wanting in the Greeke words which, because we had them not, are pretermitted: so have wee byn fayne to let the Greeke words run their full length, for lack of Abbreviations " (H3). Since no other publication identifies Fleming as "student," one may conclude that he went to London some time in 1576 or 1577, though he does not identify himself as Londoner so far as I have noted until 1582. 12 It was during these two years that he composed the commendatory poems mentioned above and contributed verses to the account of Frobisher's second voyage published in 1577 ( STC 2 22265/6) as he was to do again the following year for the third voyage ( STC 2 7607). He also published four translations, some merely pamphlet size, but all no doubt "though breefe and compendious, yet pithie and profitable" as he expressed it in STC 2 18413). For two of these Woodcock was again the publisher, while Ralph Newberrie, later a member of the syndicate, was the publisher of one, and perhaps it was he who enlisted Fleming in his first indexing project—a large table of both words and matter for the 1576 edition of Googe's translation of Palingenius' Zodiac of Life , the fourth that Newberrie had published. Such active involvement with authors and publishers during this two-year period suggests that Fleming had turned his sights away from Cambridge toward the opportunities in London—an inference his tardy B.A. would also support. In 1579 Fleming began his important connection with Henry Denham, later not only a member of the syndicate but also the printer of the Holinshed. In possession of a large stock of initials, ornaments, and borders, he had acquired around 1574 William Seres' patent for printing the Psalter, Primer for little children, and all books of private prayers in Latin and English; both stock and patent he was later to use in Fleming's behalf. One of two items published in 1579 was a "prettie pamphlet . . . replenished with recreation," a translation of Synesius' mock-encomium of baldness; to this was annexed the "Tale of Hemetes," which had been delivered before the queen at Woodstock (1575), "newly recognized," that is, revised, both in Latin and English. Since the Tale, which had greatly pleased the queen, was formerly assumed to be by George Gascoigne, Sidney Lee in the DNB accused Fleming of having boldly appropriated it for this 1579 publication. Later it was ascertained that the Tale is an anonymous work and that in angling for foreign employment, Gascoigne had translated the manuscript into Latin, French, and Italian in order to demonstrate his linguistic skills, and it was this triple translation that he presented to the queen on New Year's Day, 1576. Though A. W. Pollard observed that Fleming's "recognition" amounted to very little, his investigations at least absolved him from the charge of bold annexation. 13 The following year Fleming showed his literary ingenuity by writing a biography of William Lamb, a long-lived public benefactor who had been a gentleman of the Chapel Royal to Henry VIII and who among his other public works built a conduit in Holburn (1577) stocked with one hundred and twenty pails to enable women to sell water. Utilizing only Lamb's will, Fleming was able to spin out a Memorial of his accomplishments; among them he refers to a prayerbook called the Conduit of Comfort , published under his, i.e. Lamb's, name, (C3 v , together with a marginal reference). According to STC 2 (11037.3), a work of this title, assigned to Fleming, was published by Denham in 1579 (3 leaves extant, BL). It was entered in the Stationers' Register 26 June as "composed by Abraham fflemminge" with a fifth impression appearing in 1624. 14 Fleming comments that the benefit of this prayer-book "being bought for a little monie, [Lamb] was willing should be generall, even as the Conduite which he founded not severall but common." In 1580 Fleming again paid tribute to Lamb, devising an epitaph on his "godlie life and death," a broadside which Denham, as with the earlier Memorial , printed for Thomas Turner ( STC 2 11038). He was to insert this material into the Holinshed as drawn from an "unspecified memorial"—his own—still in print, based on Lamb's "last will and testament." 15 Increasingly during the years 1580 to 1582, Fleming's efforts as translator, editor, or compiler were concentrated on religious works, and most of these included proper indices of the principal points of doctrine as well as tables of commonplaces, the latter items indicating one direction toward which publishers were looking. Fleming was now being employed by a number of different houses though for two popular devotional treatises Denham was again both printer and publisher. The first of these entitled The Diamond of Devotion, Cut and squared into sixe severall points (with special titles such as A Swarme of Bees which consists of a hundred maxims beginning with B ) has an elaborate four-piece border on each page, a design greatly delighting Henry R. Plomer. 16 Appearing in 1581, it went through five editions. The second (1582), the Monomachie of motives ( STC 2 11048), was equally elaborate. Though as early as 1580 Fleming had augmented John Baret's quadruple dictionary ( An Alvearie, STC 2 1410) by means of specialized indices including two hundred proverbs—a number that would have been increased had not "the gatherer bene surcharged with other necessarie and dailie businesse" (4N4)—he was to revise and augment others during the years 1583-85, including John Withal's very popular Short Dictionary (which went through fifteen editions plus several issues up to 1634 under various editors); to the text of 1584, with three more editions to 1599, Fleming added six hundred rhythmical verses and interspersed proverbial statements throughout. For the English translation the next year of the Nomenclator of Hadrian Junius ( STC 2 14860) he provided a "dictional Index," consisting of c. 1400 principal words, which, in Fleming's view, was devised according to an "exquisite method." Following the list of errors to be corrected comes the trunculent statement: Cætera ut possis castigato . 17 Except for this one index, from 1585 up to 1587 Fleming was not named, it seems, in any published work so one may well conceive that during this time he was assiduously at work on the text of the three volumes of the Holinshed. In his capacity as general editor, he made brief insertions, specifying that they were taken from Grafton's Abridgement , Stow's Summary and other such helps as came to hand; these he takes care to acknowledge in the margin, for example, "Abr. Fl. ex I.F. [ Martyrologia ]". Unlike his rhyming, Fleming's prose is serviceable though it often reflects his strong Protestant and anti-papal sentiments as in this instance newly appended to the reign of Queen Mary: "Thus farre the troublesome reigne of Queene Marie the first of that name (God grant she may be the last of hir religion) eldest daughter to king Henrie the eight." After his editing and indexing duties came the arduous task of proofreading which is discussed below; that he was well occupied during this period is attested by the apology he appended to the index to Foxe's Eicasmi seu meditationes in sacram Apocalypsin , printed also in 1587 by George Bishop, a member of the syndicate (entered 7 March 1586): "O kind reader, I request you, as you are fair minded to correct the more serious errors which you may notice have crept into this index because of the absence of the proof reader from the press, and bear with patience the more trivial errors. Ab. Fl." 18 By the end of January 1587 the three volumes were ready for submission to the Privy Council; on 1 February they directed Archbishop Whitgift to stay further sale until the contents had been reviewed and reformed, naming three examiners who for greater speed should divide the work among themselves and others they thought meet for the purpose. 19 This examination resulted in excisions with the consequent need for splicing the text as mentioned above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The remainder of this account deals with the proof corrections on the basis of the copies at the Huntington. Volume 3, the first obtained, was discovered in Quaritch's basement by Jerry D. Melton, a Holinshed buff. Having purchased the volume, he carefully correlated the marked corrections with another of his copies, sometimes two, and recorded nearly 6,000 instances, a record on deposit at the Huntington (along with the volume itself which it later purchased). In most cases the corrections called for were made, the vast majority having to do with spacing, punctuation, and replacement of defective type and wrong founts. Though Volume 3 shows the hands of several correctors, some corrections can be recognized as Fleming's, for example, when he shows honor to the deity in altering secundum Deū to secundũ Deum and to himself in substituting a marginal statement of four lines by John Cheke with one of his own of three lines (this not made in all copies that I have seen). As a result of Melton's having written up an account of his findings, Volumes 1-2 (bound as one) amazingly surfaced, and these the Huntington purchased at auction; the pre-sale estimate of the number of corrections was more than 2,000 even though some pages have no marks. 20 Their number may seem extraordinary (but compare Hinman's projection from Antony and Cleopatra cited in n. 4). Even more extraordinary is their overall quality, which may be termed "finicky" in their emphasis upon typographical excellence. Some, very, very few, relate to clarity of expression as in the following two most conspicuous examples from Volumes 1-2: A vast number relate to punctuation, which of course also contributes to clarity. For much popular literature casualness may have held the day, but for writing in Latin its importance was clearly recognized; Moxon, too, it may be remembered, declared that a corrector ought to be very sagacious in pointing. 21 Fleming obviously concurred. Many of the corrections have to do with inserting commas and colons, which are marked for spacing before and after insertion, and correcting terminal punctuation. Many have to do with the esthetics of the page; thus broken line endings are regularized most fastidiously (see Fig. 1), with the spelling adjusted to compensate for insertions, or to end a sentence at the end of the print-line, or to improve hyphenation. Marginalia is repositioned to accord with the text and preferential spelling ( horsses, towards, there for ther , and advise (as a noun) indicated. Except for those indicating transposition of words or phrases, the proofreading marks would be intelligible to any corrector today. Though I have only spot-checked the more than 2,000 corrections of Volumes 1-2 with other copies, such examination shows that the compositor was not only conscientious but even long-suffering: for a letter written by a Scot he was asked, for example, to open the inner forme in order to insert the expected Scottish "u" in five words (prison, condition, consumption, etc., 1.256.a.4-31) that had been set without it in the 1577 edition (1: 371-2). All five words have it introduced, including "consumptioun". In some cases the lack of correction was no doubt inadvertent: for example (in the History of England , 99.b.29) the correction within the text calls for substitution of a question mark followed by a capital. This was made in two of the three copies at the Huntington, but the parallel marginal correction calling for the substitution of a final j for the second i in " Gregorii ," in accord with typographical convention, was ignored in all three copies. Given then the type of correction being made—no substantive matters but only "typographical infelicities," as McKenzie puts it (p. 46)—one concludes that the proof copies represent the later stage of correction that Moxon describes. A further point of interest about these copies is that, not surprisingly, they duplicate the castrated version of the text. Clearly the syndicate, including its printer, would not risk preserving materials that the Privy Council had ordered excised. Some few copies, in fact, did survive, but in the eighteenth century the noted antiquarian Thomas Hearne had seen only two, and the Huntington Library's Longden copy includes only Volumes 1-2, none of 3. 22 In the castrated copies some few pages did escape excision (for example, in 3: 1328-31 [6M3-4] should have been cancelled and replaced by a substitute paged 1328/30, but in the Huntington Library's Bridgewater copy, the Ringler copy formerly on deposit, and Melton's two copies pages 1328-31 were not excised). Evidence for Fleming as learned corrector is shown by the following telltale notations. In the address to the "Readers studious in histories" which introduces the history of England from earliest times (Vol. 1), he comments on the difficulties of antiquarian research, a task not "for everie common capacitie, naie it is a toile without head or taile even for extraordinarie wits, to correct the accounts of former ages so many hundred yeares received, out of uncerteinties to raise certeinties, and to reconcile writers dissenting in opinion and report." Above his name in typography comes the written inscription O quicquid donatur ingratis dilapidatur . (Whatever is given to ingrates is put down), followed by the abbreviation for "quoth", (Fig. 2), on sig. Y6. This holograph inscription appears again at the bottom of the title page to the Description of Scotland, again at the bottom of the title page to the History of Scotland, and for a fourth time at the end of the Index to that history. The second telltale sign is not holograph but printed; this, as mentioned earlier, served as a personal mode of identification for Fleming and appears at least ten times at the end of indices "gathered" by him from 1583 to 1589, and (apart from the presence or absence of a comma) is invariably set up to indicate a punning contrast: FINIS propositi, laus Christo nescia FINIS , which may be rendered "The end of the undertaking (but) to Christ be praise unending." 23 It appears in Volumes 1 and 2 at the end of each of the three tables he prepared (but not at the end of the one for Irish matters prepared by Hooker) and again at the end of the table for Volume 3, the table itself prefaced by the truculent statement: "If the reader be not satisfied with this table, let him not blame the order, but his owne conceipt." At the end of the Chronicles proper, there is a bibliography of sources, identified as compiled by Francis Thynne, followed by a prayerful epilogue, this surely by Fleming. After duly commending history as the most valuable study next to that of the word of God, he concludes by invoking His blessing on the queen and her kingdom, beseeching that He protect her from the "pernicious practices of satans instruments," and to save her as the "apple of his eye." With the completion of his onerous chores as editor, indexer, and certainly main proof corrector of the first two volumes of Holinshed, Fleming's religious fervor won out, and in 1588 he took holy orders. Except for the translation of the Virgilian items published in the following year and the re-ordering of Cancellar's prayer-book in 1591, as mentioned earlier, he gave over his long and hardworking connection with London printing houses, but he continued to remain "Londoner," serving as chaplain to the Countess of Nottingham and rector of St. Pancras Soper-lane. After his ordination he delivered eight sermons at Paul's Cross; somewhat ironically for one so actively involved in publication, no one of these was printed. 24</field>

W. Pollard, Records of the English Bible , The Documents (1911, pp. 289, 328). According to a patent in the Oxford archives c. 1641-42, the "books of God and of the Statute law" were to be printed with greater care and examination than for ordinary ones. At that date the king's printers maintained four correctors ("att 50 £ per Añ) a peice when other printers maintain but one for the like quantity of work"); the rates and prices of books were said to be the same as that which obtained forty years earlier. Cited in Percy Simpson, Proof-Reading in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Centuries (1935), p. 179. 4 Charlton Hinman notes that if as many errors had been proof corrected throughout the Folio as for A and C , the press variants would have totaled something like 10,000, The First Folio of Shakespeare (The Norton Facsimile), 1968, pp. xix-xx; Foxon, "The Varieties of Early Proof: Cartwright's Royal Slave , 1639, 1640," The Library , 5th ser., 25 (1970), 151-154; Blayney, pp. 194-195. 5 For an account of some reasons for the castrations, see my piece, "Some Aspects of Shakespeare's Holinshed" HLQ 50 (1987), 229-248. The problems of splicing the text for both editor and printer resulting from the intervention of the censors can be briefly illustrated from Vol. 3: replacing castrated leaves 6V1 to 7I6 (pp. 1419-1538) were a new 6V1 (pp. 1419/1420), a new leaf oddly signed A, B, C, D, E (paged 1421/1490), another signed F, G, H, I (paged 1491/1536), plus an unsigned leaf (paged 1537/1538). 6 The multiple pagination, together with the castrations, make it difficult to compute the actual length of the work. Stephen Booth has estimated the number of words at three and a half million ( The Book Called Holinshed's Chronicles [1968], p. 1), and Anne Castanien has estimated the number of pages at 2752 with more than a hundred pages of indices, charts, etc. ("Censorship and Historiography in Elizabethan England: The Expurgation of Holinshed's Chronicles ," unpublished dissertation, Univ. of California, Davis, 1970, p. 136 n.). Henry Bynneman, who had held the queen's patent for all dictionaries, chronicles, and histories and printed the 1577 edition, declared in 1582 that such printing in these few years had cost him £1,200 (Edward Arber, A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554-1640 , I, II, 1875, I, 116). The 1587 edition was of course much larger than the 1577. 7 Both Sarah C. Dodson ("Abraham Fleming, Writer and Editor," University of Texas Studies in English , 34 [1955], 51-66) and William E. Miller ("Abraham Fleming: Editor of Shakespeare's Holinshed," Texas Studies in Literature and Language , 1 [1959-60], 89-100) have discussed aspects of Fleming's career. Indeed Miller percipiently suggested (p. 91) that Fleming was a "learned corrector" but equated it with "editor" (pp. 94, 100); in the case of the Holinshed this turns out to be correct. 8 For an example of the problems resulting from censorship, see n. 5. Materials relating to it in Fleming's papers, mostly in Latin, came into the hands of Francis Peck who listed them in the second volume of his Desiderata Curiosa (1732-35), with a promise to publish them later; this he unfortunately failed to do, and they appear to have since disappeared. 9 Simpson, pp. 138-139. For Oxford printing in the Elizabethan period he was able to cite only the classical scholar at Magdalen College John Sanford, who had served as corrector for a Latin text published in 1592 (p. 164); to this single instance James Binns ("STC Latin Books: Evidence for Printing-House Practice," Library , 5th ser., 32 [1977], 7-8) has been able to add the name of Angel Roche, commended for his proof-reading skills in the dedicatory letter of de Bury's Philobiblon published in 1599. 10 Fleming died in 1607—"circiter," as he says in the epitaph, age fifty-six. This is quoted in Athenae Cantabrigienses , ed. C. H. and Thompson Cooper (1861), II, 459-464, where they list fifty-seven titles of books and manuscripts with which Fleming was involved in one or another of his various capacities as translator, indexer, etc., together with an extensive list of manuscripts drawn from Fleming's papers by Francis Peck (see n. 8). 11 R. B. McKerrow, A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers in England, Scotland, Ireland, and of Foreign Printers of English Books, 1557-1640 (1910). 12 Another industrious compiler and translator during the same period, Thomas Hill (otherwise known an Didymus Mountain), also makes a point of identifying himself as "Londoner." 13 Pollard, Introduction to The Queen's Majesty's Entertainment at Woodstock (1903, 1910); see also C. T. Prouty, George Gascoigne, Elizabethan Courtier, Soldier, and Poet (1942), pp. 221-225. 14 There is no attribution in STC 2 of any work by William Lamb. The title was a popular one: A. F. Allison and V. F. Goldsmith (1976) assign two such titles to W. Cowper and W. Fleetwood in their listing of anonymous books ( Titles of English Books, 1475-1640 ). Such collections may have been thumbed into extinction as was the case with Fleming's 1591 revision of James Cancellar's popular Alphabet of Prayers ( STC 2 4562) which exists in a single copy (Folger) while Oxford possesses a single leaf with colophon dated 1593. 15 3.1311.a.60-1313 a. 46. References to Holinshed are by volume, page, column α and b and line number. 16 Plomer, English Printers' Ornaments (1926), p. 48. 17 Denham published the Alvearie alone and then with Newberrie Fleming's revision of the Veron-Waddington dictionary ( STC 2 24678) in 1584 and the Junius-Higgins ( STC 2 14860) in 1585. The Coopers (see n. 10) also credit Fleming with substituting the English vocabulary for the French in Morelius' Verborum Latinorum cum Graecis Anglicisque . . . Commentarij (1583) though DeWitt T. Starnes ( Renaissance Dictionaries: English-Latin and Latin-English [1954], p. 205) questions their authority for this. One may note that the volume proper has commendatory verses by Fleming, that it was entered to Newberrie and Denham in 1584, and that, according to STC 2 18101, some copies have Fleming's name on the title page as compiler of the index. 18 Cited and translated in Binns' "STC Latin Books: Further Evidence for Printing-House Practice," Library , 6th ser., 1 (1979), 352. 19 Acts of the Privy Council of England, 1542-1604 (n.s., ed. J. R. Dasent, 1890-1907), 1586-87, pp. 311-312. One of the designated examiners—Henry Killigrew, an experienced diplomat—left England 25 June 1587 with Leicester on his return to the Low Countries and so the examination was probably completed by then. Since the 1577 edition had already been examined, the pages under scrutiny were not extensive—Harrison's enlarged Description of England (which may not have been reviewed); the materials added to the Irish history (from 1546 where Holinshed left off, plus a translation of Giraldus); and the more crucial extension of Scots material from 1571 to 1585 and of the English from 1576 to 1586. 20 For Melton's account of his discovery, see the Antiquarian Book Monthly Review (Jan., 1982), 8-11; for an account of Volumes 1-2, secured at auction, see Daniel Woodward, "The Proof of the Printing . . . ," Huntington Library Calendar (July-August, 1982), 4-5. 21 See Binns, "STC Latin Books . . . ," (1977), n. 9 above for Latin authorial citations and Moxon, p. 247. As Morse Peckham has observed, "Punctuation is not a form or dress of substantives, something different from words. It is part of speech." ("Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," Print , 1 [1971], 124). 22 Called in at an unspecified date by Burghley to answer for a passage found offensive to the Earl of Shrewsbury, Thynne supplied a revision, admitting, however, that some few copies had earlier been dispersed. This interview must have taken place before the castrations were ordered by the Privy Council since the page on which Thynne's revision would have appeared was cancelled along with other matters thought to be offensive to the Scots (Donno, "Some Aspects," pp. 233-238). 23 I am grateful to Professor David F. Bright (Dept. of Classics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) for interpreting the construction of nescia FINIS as analogous to those found in medieval manuscripts. 24 The dates for each of his sermons are given in the papers Peck published.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Compositor Identification in Romeo Q1 and Troilus by W. Craig Ferguson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The handling of spacing materials by Elizabethan compositors has recently been a subject of attention. Trevor Howard-Hill has demonstrated that compositors in the Shakespeare First Folio can be distinguished by the ways they space commas. 1 The point is made that this is a 'psychomechanical' habit on which the copy has little or no bearing, and thus is more useful as evidence than spellings, which may have been influenced by the copy. Greg's term 'accidental' might apply to the use of spaces, but perhaps we should take up the suggestion by Tom Davis, and refer to the handling of spaces and quads as part of a compositor's 'style.' 2 I wish first to examine the use of spacing materials in the positioning of speech prefixes to see if compositorial style is evident. When a compositor sets a prefix, it is usual for him to distinguish it from the text. On rare occasions (as in the Ben Jonson quartos and 1616 folio) he will set it flush left, but by far the most common practice was to indent the prefix, and to do so he must begin by placing a blank space in his composing stick. But which space will he use? Is he indifferent to this and likely to use any spacing material that comes to hand, or will he reach habitually to one of the four boxes available to him? I believe that he will habitually reach for his preferred spacing, either an em quad, an en quad, or a 3-to-em space. The reach for a quad takes him to an entirely different part of his case from a reach for a space, and if it is done consistently one way or the other I think we have evidence of a stylistic habit which can help in compositor identification. This is not all there is to the prefix; there remain the form of the prefix, the spacing, if any, between prefix and punctuation mark, the mark itself, and the spacing between completed prefix and the text. Does the compositor make an effort to place the same spacing after as before, thus setting the prefix neatly off on the page? Does he consider the spacing material as a primary or secondary variable when he has to justify a line? Does he have a habitual way with punctuation? As a preliminary example, consider the prefixes in parts of the first quarto of Pericles . Here there are three compositors in two shops. One compositor, x , working in William White's shop, set sheets A and C-E. The remaining sheets, B and F-I, were set in Thomas Creede's shop by two compositors, y and z . 3 White's x and Creede's y uniformly indent the prefix by an em, but compositor z , who set B3-4 v , F3 v ,4,G3-H2 v , and I2 v -3 v can be very neatly identified by his habit of indenting speech prefixes two ems, which is rather excessive. This peculiarity has already been noted by David Hoeniger in the 1963 New Arden edition of the play (p. xxvii), where he states that Richard Hosley pointed out to him that one of the compositors of the text can be spotted by his habit of deep indentation of prefixes. I mention this case only to make the point that such seemingly small details can be decisive in compositor identification. As a further example, let us look at the first quarto of Romeo and Juliet . The first four sheets (A-D) were printed by John Danter, and the remainder (E-K) by Edward Allde. There has been a view that the switch was the result of Danter's arrest during Lent of 1597, but recent scholarship suggests that it was a normal shared commercial venture. 4 The presence of two compositors in Allde's section was detected many years ago by Harry R. Hoppe. He determined that one man, X, set E1, E2 v -4 v , F3-4 v , G3-4 v , H3-4 v , I3-4 v , and K3,3 v , while the other, Y, set E1 v ,2, F1-2 v , G1-2 v , H1-2 v , I1-2 v , K1-2 v and K4, basically an even division in which one took the first half of a gathering and his mate took the second. "From F3 until sig K the alternation is as regular as a pendulum," Hoppe remarked. Hoppe's evidence was basically spellings, bolstered by apostrophe use. Compositor X preferred 'doo, frier, here, yong,' the speech prefix ' Capo. ', '-ie' endings, and no apostrophes in contracted forms, whereas Y preferred 'doe, fryer, here, young,' the prefix ' Cap. ', '-y' endings, and the use of apostrophes in contracted forms, such as 'wher's'. There are two further preferences which match the two compositors and aid in identification. The first of these, which Hoppe noticed, was a tendency of X to use a swash ' I ' in ' Iuliet ', but this use of swash is actually part of a larger pattern, and holds true for all the letters for which there were swash sorts: ' A, B, C, E, I, M, N, P '. We find that X, setting a total of 358 italic caps, reached for swash sorts 131 times, a 37% use, while Y, setting 187 italic caps, used swash 28 times, only a 15% use. There is a second preference in the choice of types, but this was not noticed by Hoppe. When selecting a colon to complete the italic prefix, X was somewhat more likely to continue to reach into his italic case, instead of making the switch to his roman. He set 280 colons in his stint, and selected an italic sort 164 times, for a 59% preference. Compositor Y, on the other hand, preferred turning back to his roman case, and setting 177 colons, used italic 42 times, for a 24% usage. I also wish to examine other evidence which Hoppe did not consider. Certainly as clear as spellings and swash or italics in identifying these two compositors are their different ways of setting speech prefixes. The prefix in each case consists of indentation by at least an en, the prefix in italic, and then a colon, followed by a space. However, on certain pages I found that the compositor frequently inserted a thin space between the prefix and the colon. Following these pages through the text one finds that this habit is seen only on the pages Hoppe assigned to compositor X, and also on F1 v , F2, G1, and G1 v assigned by Hoppe to Y. I would suggest that, as evidence, it is at least as strong as spelling preferences. The additional evidence of spacing, swash, and colons essentially backs up Hoppe's assignments to the two compositors, but there are five doubtful pages which bear further examination. The first of these is E1. Hoppe was hesitant about assigning this page, as the evidence was flimsy, consisting of five '-ie' endings and a single spelling. The evidence, such as it was, pointed to X. This page, consistently, has the space before the colon, a marked preference (13 of 15) for italic colons, and the use of swash over a third of the time (6 of 15), suggesting that he was right in assuming X was the compositor. I do not agree with Hoppe's attribution of F1 v and F2 to compositor Y. The first of these pages has both spaced and unspaced colons after prefixes, seven spaced and five unspaced, of which three of the unspaced could be attributed to justification. The spelling evidence is slight, and Hoppe records two uses of the apostrophe in elisions ( wher's and hee's ), but he does not consider five occasions ( pepperd, yfaith, heele, staind and tane ) where an apostrophe could have been used and was not. When one looks at italic colons and swash caps, the evidence for an attribution to X grows stronger, with an 8 to 4 preference for italic colons, and a 40% use of swash, 7 out of 17. I would suggest that Hoppe is wrong in assigning this page to compositor Y, and I assign it to X. On F2 there is a slightly different pattern. The page begins with spaced colons, and then after two speeches and eight lines moves to the non-spaced pattern. The spelling evidence Hoppe advances is not definitive. He suggests that while X always used '-ie' endings in preference to '-y' endings, compositor Y will allow '-ie' endings on occasion. On this page, the only example, "beautie', occurs on the first line, and is associated with the spaced-colon prefixes. On the other hand, a decided Y preference, 'heere', is found in the non-spaced section of the page. Might one not suggest that one compositor, in this case X, began the page, and that his mate took over from him at line nine, ten, or eleven? 5 The evidence on pages G1 and G1 v suggests sharing again. Hoppe gave both pages to Y, which would fit the pattern of dividing gatherings in half. But on G1 there are 13 prefixes, 7 having spaces before the colon, which is italic: an X form. There is a concentration of 3 non-spaced prefixes with roman colons in the last two lines and catchword which suggests to me that X set at least 22 lines, and Y came in only to finish the last few lines. The exact point of change cannot be determined, as 6 lines of speech come between the last X prefix and the first Y form, but Y set at least the last two lines and the direction line. There are 3 non-spaced prefixes, ' Fr :' on X's part of the page (one of which could be justified) which remain anomalies. The Y pattern continues at the top of G1 v , where the first line contains a Y form of prefix, and the six-line speech has two elision apostrophes and one Y spelling. This is followed at line 7 by an X-form prefix: swash cap, space, italic colon. In turn this is followed by two more X forms, then the Y pattern, suggesting that Y began the page, set 6 lines, was replaced by X who set 12 lines, and then back to Y at line 19, who finished the page. I would suggest, then, that Hoppe was essentially right in his assignment of this quarto to two compositors, and that his evidence is backed up by the prefix composition and the use of swash, which strengthens his attribution of E1 to X. I would disagree with Hoppe on the assignment of F1 v , F2, G1, and G1 v , and note that he himself had doubts about the first four pages of sheet F. The next text I wish to examine is the first quarto of Troilus and Cressida , printed in 1609 by George Eld. In this play it has been long understood that two compositors, A and B, set the play between them, with compositor A setting A2-B2 v , C3-D2 v , E3-G4 v , H3-I2 v , K1-3 v , K4 v , and L3-M1 v , and B setting B3-C2 v , D3-E2 v , H1-2 v , I3-4 v , K4, and L1-2 v . The evidence, first produced by Phillip Williams, 6 has been reviewed by Alice Walker in the 1957 New Cambridge edition of the play (p. 129). One aspect not examined by Williams or Walker was the spacing of the speech prefixes, and this produces an interesting pattern. The prefix consists of an indentation, the prefix in italic (except where the compositors had run out of italic caps and had to resort to roman), a period or a colon, and a space. What varies, though, is the amount of indentation before the prefix, resulting from the use of either an en quad or the narrower three-to-em space. The wider en quad appears more often than the thinner three-to-em space. Two things about the thinner spaces are peculiar. They do not appear at random, but are grouped together on the page: either an entire page or a part of one. Where they are found on part of a page, the concentration is usually towards the bottom of the page, completing it. The second point is that they all occur on pages which have been assigned to A, who otherwise used en quads. Thus I wish to argue that the use of the thinner three-to-em space to indent the prefix is a habit of a third compositor, C, who assisted compositor A. There should be other evidence to support the view that a third man was involved, and one useful test is to extract those lines of the text suspected to have been the work of C, and run a spelling check on them, together with a check on A and B's stints. I used the Oxford Concordance Program to run my spelling checks. 7 The tapes of Troilus and several other plays were dumped into our mainframe, and the computer asked to generate concordances by line numbers which corresponded to the lines I assigned to each compositor. As one cannot assume that C would take over from A at the beginning of a new speech, the lines of dialogue between the last A and the first C prefix were omitted from the concordances. Assuming only two compositors, compositor A would have set 64% of the play, B would have set 36%. However, I suggest that B still set the 36% previously assigned to him, but that A set 40%, and C set 24%. There are two problems with sorting out the compositors of Troilus . First, one must isolate B, who worked alone, and then separate A and C. Some spelling variations not previously noted are peculiar to B and confirm the assignments of Williams and Walker, while others are useful in separating A from C. The significant spellings are as follows: A B C Aga. (10) Agam. (2) Aga. (3) Agam. (25) Aga. (11) Agam. (4) Dio. (24) Diom. (4) Dio. (0) Diom. (4) Dio. (10) Diom. (13) Pan. (56) Pand. (31) Pan. (2) Pand. (16) Pan. (41) Pand. (3) Patr. (9) Patro. (6) Patr. (2) Patro. (7) Patr. (0) Patro. (4) Ther. (19) Thers(i). (16) Ther. (8) Thers(i). (3) Ther. (31) Thers(i). (2) Tro(y). (70) Troyl. (0) Tro(y). (11) Troyl. (22) Tro(y). (28) Troyl. (2) Ulis. (22) Uliss. (12) Ulis. (13) Uliss. (4) Ulis. (8) Uliss. (11) Aeneas(11) Eneas(0) Aeneas(10) Eneas(0) Aeneas(4) Eneas(4) Cressid(a)(21) Cresseid(a)(4) Cressid(a)(1) Cresseid(a)(15) Cressid(a)(8) Cresseid(a)(0) Helen(2) Hellen(15) Helen(6) Hellen(1) Helen(0) Hellen(6) blood(y)(3) bloud(y)(6) blood(y)(2) bloud(y)(8) blood(y)(0) bloud(y)(13) do(46) doe(17) do(36) doe(6) do(30) doe(2) go(18) goe(10) go(25) goe(6) go(10) goe(9) here(26) heere(10) here(13) heere(21) here(19) heere(1) lie(4) lye(5) lie(3) lye(4) lie(3) lye(0) O(30) Oh(14) O(28) Oh(0) O(5) Oh(10) sinews(1) sinewes(1) sinews(2) sinewes(0) sinews(0) sinewes(3) sweet(14) sweete(15) sweet(4) sweete(4) sweet(13) sweete(3) th'(elision)(13) th'(elision)(6) th'(elision)(0) One notes in passing B's preferences for longer prefixes, such as ' Agam. ', ' Troyl. ', and ' Pand. ' instead of ' Aga. ', ' Troy. ', and ' Pan. '. It is interesting also to note that B never used a colon as punctuation after a prefix: always (268 times) a period. The other two, between them, used colons about a fifth of the time; to be specific, 172 of their 816 prefixes were followed by colons. We come now to separating A from C. The two men, I think it can safely be assumed, worked from the same type cases, as the unit for shortages of italic caps is the page, and not the stints of each compositor. Had they been using separate cases, then one would hardly expect them to run low in exactly the same places. The most distinctive characteristic distinguishing the two is their treatment of speech prefixes: C uses the narrower three-to-em space to indent the prefix, while A uses the thicker en quad. By glancing down the page one can see how C's prefixes are closer to the left-hand margin than A's. There are two kinds of spelling evidence. In some cases A preferred one form and C preferred another, but in several instances one man would have a preference while his mate was indifferent. Take their approach to the spelling of prefixes, for example. C used the longer prefix, ' Diom. ', 13 times, the shorter, ' Dio. ', 10. More or less indifferent. Compositor A, on the other hand, had a decided preference for the shorter form, using it 24 times to the longer form's 4. A similar pattern emerges with the prefixes for Pandarus, only this time the evidence is the reverse. A is more or less indifferent, using the short form, ' Pan. ', 56 times and the longer, ' Pand. ', 31. C, on the other hand, used the short form almost exclusively, 41 to 3. A third pattern is seen in C's preference for the longer ' Vliss. ' over ' Vlis. ' (11 to 8) against A's 22 to 11 preference for the shorter form. Common words show similar patterns. C never used the form 'blood(y)', using only 'bloud(y)', 13 times. A was less consistent, using 'blood(y)' a third of the time. C never used the form 'Cresseid(a)' and was almost invariant in preferring 'here' to 'heere', while A was less consistent. C preferred 'Oh' to 'O', two to one, while A was just the opposite. Compositor C had a decided preference for 'sweet' over 'sweete', while A was indifferent. C never used the contraction 'th'', while A used it 13 times. C was indifferent to 'go/goe', while A preferred the shorter form; but C was more consistent than A in preferring 'do' to 'doe'. Other spellings are less useful because of their infrequency. 8 Therefore I wish to assign the following portions of compositor A's stint to the new workman, C: all of A3 v , B2, G4 v , H4, I2 v , K1 v ,2, and L3-M1 v . He shared the following pages with A, setting A2 (last 8 lines), A4 (last 24), B1 (last 9), B2 v (last 18), C4 (last 18), C4 v (last 17), D1 (last 32), D2 (lines 8 to 23), E3 (last 24), E3 v (last 14), E4 (last 31), F2 v (last 7), F3 (last 7), G2 (last 17), I1 (last 13), I1 v (lines 12 to 24), I2 (lines 1 to 8, 14 to 38), and K4 v (last 12). We come finally to consider the reliability of these compositors. There are in the quarto 128 clear compositor errors. 9 Had the men been equally competent, B, setting 36% of the text, would have made 46 errors, A, setting 40%, 51, and C, setting 24%, 31. However, we find that B made 31 errors, A made 54, but C made 43, many more, proportionally, than the others. B was clearly the most accurate of the three, A fairly accurate, but C was by far the least accurate. The three men made different kinds of errors. A omitted words 16 times, B only twice, and C 7 times. On the other hand, A had the best record of not substituting words of similar sound, doing so only 10 times, while B did it 8, and C 14 times. (One must keep in mind with these figures the percentages of text each man set.) I do not think it would be reasonable to assert that A set all the pages previously assigned to him and that his accuracy deteriorated in the lines he set when he just happened to reach for a space instead of a quad to indent a prefix. Rather, the evidence of a habit of prefix setting, together with the evidence of spelling habits and relative accuracy, are not coincidental and point to the presence of a third, less competent, compositor.</field>

One must also note the admonition of D. F. McKenzie in his article "Stretching a Point: Or, The Case of the Spaced-out Comps" ( SB , 37, 1984), 106-121. He quotes Gaskell as saying that all spaces were kept in the same box within the type-case. True enough, but the distinction must be made between spaces and quadrats; spaces were in the nearest box to the compositor, quads in three boxes in the lower-right corner of the lower case. Many of the distinctions which follow are between spaces and quads and so, I hope, side-step some of McKenzie's objections. 2 See his bibliographical note, "Substantives? Accidentals?" in The Library , 6th ser. 3 (1981), 149-151. 3 The designations of x , y , and z were made by Philip Edwards in "An approach to the problem of Pericles ," Shakespeare Survey 5 , (1952), and later adapted by David Hoeniger in the New Arden edition of the play. The attribution of part of the play to Creede has not been made before, but the type used in Creede's #5, as illustrated in SB , 23 (1970), 150. No other English printer used this type at this time. 4 The earlier view was put forth by Harry R. Hoppe in his The Bad Quarto of Romeo and Juliet , Cornell Studies in English, XXXVI, 1948. The view was challenged by J. A. Lavin in his 1970 study, "John Danter's Ornamental Stock", SB , 23 (1970), 21-45, and his view accepted by the New Arden editor, Brian Gibbons, in 1980. 5 One might object that it would have been impossible to pay a compositor for part-page setting. We know, however, that this was occasionally the practice, as Hinman has shown to be the case in the Shakespeare First Folio. The method of payment in the early seventeenth century was not fixed, and could have been at a rate per thousand ens, or at a fixed wage per week. The matter is discussed by D. F. McKenzie in his study, The Cambridge University Press 1696-1712 (1966). See Volume I, Chapter 5. 6 Privately communicated to Harold H. Hildenbrand in 1950, who used it in his 1953 New Variorum edition, p. 346f. 7 Funds for obtaining the tapes from Oxford were provided by the School of Graduate Studies and Research, Queen's University, and I wish to record my thanks. I warn users of this data base of a problem I encountered with it. I made the assumption that the quarto texts supplied by OCP would have used the standard through-line numbering system which was used in the published Oxford concordances, and asked for lines accordingly. However, the OCP tapes use a line numbering system of their own, and I had to re-do the concordance using their line numbers as figured out from the print-out I had. 8 In his New Arden edition of the play Kenneth Palmer states that sheet F was set by a third compositor. I can see no evidence that this is so, as the pattern of setting by A and C follows, as do their spellings. The words Palmer advances are infrequently used, and are not enough to set a variant pattern. Indeed, one of the words he cites, 'ticle/tickle', is spelled both ways by A, and appears only once in sheet F. Similarly, the word 'bucle/buckle' is found only three times in the text. 9 The easiest way to obtain the information required is to use the textual notes given in the Riverside edition of the play. I am most grateful that this information was so easily available. These notes were aided by the placing within brackets of all deviations from the quarto, which served as the copy-text for the edition. The errors for each man are given below. Words or letters within brackets are omissions, words following the slash are correct readings. I give the evidence in full, as some readers may object to the inclusion or omission of some instances, claiming the possibility of scribal error instead of compositorial error.

      <field name="heading_text">Scribal Texts and Literary Communities: The Rochester Circle Osborn b. 105 by Harold Love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yale University Library MS Osborn b. 105 is the best known of the large body of manuscript miscellanies of verse from the Restoration period. Even in its present mutilated state, with a total of forty-five leaves excised by some prudish past owner, it has been accepted by both David M. Vieth and Keith Walker as the most important single witness to the text of Rochester. Yet it is also fair to say that, since the manuscript was first brought to the attention of scholars in 1963 through Vieth's monumental study in Attribution in Restoration Poetry , there has been no substantial increment to our understanding of it. 1 The problem is not so much one of lack of evidence as of uncertainty about what questions scholars should be asking. In the feeling that a quarter of a century is too long to have been waiting for a significant advance on Vieth's findings, I would like to present some new hypotheses concerning the origins and production of the manuscript. First of all, it is necessary to consider what is already known or has been plausibly guessed about Osborn b. 105. It is a collection that before mutilation probably consisted of between seventy and eighty poems in the first or original hand, along with eight added later by a second hand. What immediately follows is concerned only with the poems in the first hand. The most important datum is that the contents of its surviving pages and their order are largely identical with those of the corresponding sections of the 1680 Poems on Several Occasions by the Right Honourable, the E. of R --- (henceforth 1680H ), with the exception of eleven poems unique to the manuscript and one unique to the edition. 2 Vieth (pp. 80-83) demonstrates by means of line counts that the correspondence probably continued through the various gaps caused by excision, apart from two instances where the manuscript again had room for additional material. Although the precise relationship of these two texts has yet to be established, and Vieth suspected some measure of conflation from an outside source, it was undoubtedly close. 3 Vieth (p. 74) believed that the lost manuscript (henceforth MS1680H ) which served as copy for 1680H was the work of the same scribe and resembled Osborn b. 105 in containing a number of ascriptions to authors, arguing that these were omitted by the printer in order to pass off the edition as being entirely the work of Rochester. This too is simply a hypothesis, and one that should not be accepted uncritically, but is plausible in the light of our present knowledge. The alternative would be that the attributions were added from personal knowledge by the scribe of Osborn b. 105 or in some manuscript intermediate between it and the nearest common ancestor. Most of the poems also exist in other contemporary manuscript anthologies and sometimes also as single sheets of the kind that were passed from hand to hand at court, sent through the post with newsletters or made available to the frequenters of coffee-houses. 4 Vieth's suggestion, based on the estimated date of the last-composed item, that the manuscript's contents were first assembled in the spring of 1680 will hardly be argued with (p. 65). It is written in a clear but unfussy professional hand which is also found in Princeton MS Taylor 1 (see below) composed of political satires of the time. As mentioned, the surviving sections of the manuscript lack only one poem present in the edition, and that the very last, "On Rome's Pardons." Vieth wonders if this may have been added by the printer in order to fill up space on the last sheet (pp. 79, 355-356). The consistently good quality of the text of the 1680 compilation (here used to cover both the manuscript and the edition) is confirmed by the practice of recent editors of Rochester who all show a strong preference in their choice of copy texts for one or the other, usually favoring the manuscript. 5 The poems themselves range in date of composition from the mid-166os to late 1679, and some at least had been circulating in manuscript as separate entities for many years prior to the compilation of the collection. 6 These considerations suggest a collection assembled step by step over a considerable period by someone who was consistently able to lay his hands on good texts of poems soon after their appearance, and who therefore presumably moved in the same literary circles as the writers. A useful contrast can be made with the topical verse sporadically included in the commonplace book of the courtier Sir William Haward (Bodleian MS Don b. 8) which includes a number of items which also appear in the 1680 compilation. Haward's contacts were also good and he often obtained copies at very close to the apparent date of composition, but neither was his collection as comprehensive nor his information about authorship nearly as assured as that of the 1680 compiler. His texts, moreover, vary greatly in their quality. The presence of eleven poems in the surviving leaves of the manuscript which are not found in the edition (with more probably lost from the excised sections) raises the question whether we are dealing with a collection that expanded in the course of recopying (with the edition representing the earlier state) or whether MS1680H had the same contents as Osborn b. 105. Vieth argues for the second alternative, maintaining that MS1680H probably contained all the poems contained in Osborn b. 105 but that some had to be left out of the edition for reasons of space. His assumptions about the nature of MS1680H become evident in the course of speculations about the nature of the nearest common ancestor (called by him "the archetype") from which they derived the readings they share against other sources: Was the archetype the copy-text for the Huntington edition? Probably not, if the text underwent conflation during its passage from the archetype to the edition; such contamination would be more likely to occur in an intervening manuscript. Was the archetype a single manuscript copied by one scribe, or was it a pile of heterogeneous loose sheets which had circulated from hand to hand? Probably it was a single manuscript, since otherwise the Yale MS. and the editions might not exhibit such close correspondence in their order and contents. If the archetype was a single homogeneous text, was it produced by the scribe of the Yale MS.? Probably it was, if we can trust the analogy of surviving families of Restoration manuscript miscellanies: normally all members of such a family are in the same handwriting. Was the archetype the original copy of the collection? Probably we shall never know (p. 69). Most of this is plausible, but none of it is conclusive. Surviving families of Restoration miscellanies are not so numerous that we can generalize from them without risk. Moreover, if we widen our horizons by looking at scribal publication as a phenomenon of the earlier as well as the later Stuart period, and as embracing such diverse activities as the distribution of musical part books and reports of parliamentary proceedings, it can be argued that the dominant model is that of the "rolling" archetype from which old material is continually removed and new material added in the course of production. 7 Aware of this objection, Vieth invokes the evidence of "linked groups" of poems, which appear in the same order in other manuscript sources, arguing that in four cases it is Osborn b. 105 which preserves the "normal" group while the edition has it in reordered or (in one case) truncated form (pp. 76-79). In these cases it is hard not to agree that the "archetype," however conceived of, will have preserved the attested order; yet it would still be possible that the changes originated during the copying of MS1680H rather than when it was being marked up for printing. Vieth's response to this possibility is to argue that it is the change of medium which is more likely to have provoked the alteration: The existence of a linked group is difficult to prove, nor is the evidence concerning these four groups as extensive or unequivocal as one could desire. In surviving families of manuscript miscellanies, the various members are often not identical in contents or arrangement; hence the archetype or the copy-text for the Huntington edition may have differed from the Yale MS. in ways which the available evidence cannot reveal. On the other hand, the differences between the Huntington edition and the Yale MS. are most likely to have arisen during the process of printing, since this constituted a shift from one medium of transmission to another. Significantly, almost all of the eleven additional poems in the Yale MS. occur near the end of the collection, where the printer might have omitted some material in order to limit his book to a prescribed number of gatherings (pp. 79-80). Here the argument, although logical, is not as strong as it seems. In the first place, the point made in the last sentence only holds if one restricts oneself to the eleven poems that can actually be shown to be missing from the edition (and whose order in Vieth's reconstructed contents table to Osborn b. 105 of 72 items is 3, 47, 53, 55, 58, 61, 62, 67, and 69-71) and ignores his demonstration (pp. 93-100) that additional material totaling more than seven pages had also been present in the fourth and fifth gaps, corresponding to items 17-22 and 34-63. Moreover, even if true, it would not meet the objection that, in a "rolling" collection, new material which was not linked in an obviously thematic way with items already present would also tend to cluster towards the end. A more general objection is that a printer setting from a bound manuscript, as Vieth believes to have been the case, would have no reason to alter the order of items, this being much more likely to happen when a text is being copied from an exemplar in the form of separate leaves or booklets. Viewed in this light the case for a rolling archetype against a static one is stronger than Vieth gives it credit for being, though not strong enough for us to assume without further corroboration that 1680H represents an earlier state of the compilation and Osborn b. 105 a later, enlarged one. Vieth's uncharacteristic failure to think through this question seems to arise from his attention having been directed towards problems of determining attributions and establishing a text for Rochester, in which the issue is not of very great moment. However, it becomes of crucial importance (as will be seen later) as soon as one wishes to analyse the contents of the compilation for evidence of its genesis. A further argument for accretion is that a process of this kind can be observed at work in the manuscript itself in the form of the group of poems added at the end by the second hand. These are of similar date and may well have been added by an assistant to the original copyist, but are all absent from 1680H and seem unlikely to have been present in MS1680H . Another issue is whether Osborn b. 105 is to be considered a "factory manuscript," produced for sale, or a private commission from a litterateur to a scrivener or secretary. Vieth's speculation that it "formerly existed in several more copies in the same handwriting" endorses the first of these possibilities and leads him to the further suggestion that the manuscript was one of a set of complementary compilations, another of which is represented by Princeton MS Taylor 1, whose contents are entirely composed of political satires. Noting that the only songs contained in Osborn b. 105 are those by Rochester, Vieth (p. 90) further proposes that there might have been a third volume composed only of songs. Although there is no evidence of a connection it should be noted that exactly such a collection has become incorporated into Edinburgh University Library MS DC. 1. 3 (pp. 108-112), a compendium of six independently circulated miscellanies. However, to accept the likelihood that the manuscript was produced for sale (an assumption strengthened by evidence to be presented later) is not to imply that those responsible for copying it were also the original compilers of the collection. One last piece of textual evidence that only became available in 1986 is that the text of Rochester's "Seneca's Troas" in Osborn b. 105 is identical in its substantive readings with one printed by Charles Blount in his edition in 1680 of The Two First Books of Philostratus . 8 Blount's source for this was presumably the manuscript of the poem he mentions in a letter to Rochester of 7 February 1679 in terms which have led some writers to assume that it was a gift from Rochester, though in my view with insufficient justification. The simplest and in textual terms the most economical explanation for this close agreement would be that the compiler of the manuscript took his text from Blount's volume; but other explanations are possible and might be worth reviewing should any further evidence emerge concerning the matter. 9 This discussion does not attempt to deal with the intricate question of the relationship of the "archetype" to other surviving collections containing a high proportion of the same poems, such as Stockholm Riks-Bibliotheket MS Vu 69 (Vieth's "Gyldenstolpe MS"), Leeds Brotherton MS Lt. 54, Nottingham University Library MS Portland PwV. 40, Victoria and Albert Museum MS Dyce 43, Vienna Nationalbibliothek MS 14090, and Harvard MS Eng. 636F. The most likely possibilities are (1) that the poems common to these manuscripts and the "archetype" are derived from an ancestor of the archetype, or (2) that they and the "archetype" were independently garnered selections of material that was in scribal circulation as single poems and groups of poems. It does not seem to be the case that the texts of either group are descended from those of the other. 10 The matter is one to which I hope to return on another occasion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Having considered what can be deduced concerning the physical manuscript and its textual relationship with the edition, I would now like to turn to the social context of compilation, a matter about which Vieth has assembled a wealth of data without actually proceeding to interpretation. In doing so I propose to use two approaches which have not so far been applied to the material. The first is comparison with analogous situations from a history of scribal publication of verse and prose miscellanies which reaches back to the reign of James I. The second, and more radical, is the analysis of the collection as a communal construct, reflecting three apparent layers of compilation. My aim in doing so is not to contravert Vieth's conclusions, which as a rule are carefully reasoned and presented with a scrupulous explanation of their limitations, but to suggest that a case can be made for possibilities that were rejected by him because they did not seem germane to the particular aims of his enquiry. Underlying both Vieth's and my own approaches to the collection is the desire to find a significant shape for the materials which would permit a further process of reasoning from the known to the unknown. In Vieth's case the shape educed was a linear one based on the sequence of items in the manuscript: It was designed to be an anthology of verse composed by members of the Court circle, especially Rochester, and its poems were arranged in a careful, intricate order determined largely by their authorship. Roughly the first half of the anthology consists of poems which the compiler thought were written by Rochester or concerned Rochester in some way—that is, satires on him, poems which he answered, or poems written in answer to his. The second half was intended to comprise poems by miscellaneous authors other than Rochester, though the compiler inadvertently included five poems which are probably Rochester's work. The section of poems by or concerning Rochester is further divided by genre into a subsection of what might loosely be termed satires and translations, followed by a subsection of songs ( Gyldenstolpe Manuscript , pp. xviii-xix). In this what is no more than a demonstrable tendency (that poems in a certain section of the manuscript seem to be mostly by Rochester) has been extended into a general principle for declaring some works authentic and others suppositious. The principle is then used to establish three working assumptions concerning the reliability of attributions which although printed by Vieth in italic type, as if they possessed the certainty of theorems, are in fact no more than plausible guesses (pp. 74, 86, 88). Making no pretence to conclusiveness, I would like to explore the possibilities of another shape which is not in this instance linear, but which involves trying to look at the collection as a series of strata, each laid in place by a separate community of readers. The analysis of miscellanies as communal creations is a familiar enough technique to scholars of mediaeval poetry and becomes even more relevant with the advent of the seventeenth century when manuscript publication became a matter of choice rather than necessity and was normally undertaken with the explicit aim of restricting texts to a small group of the like minded. The composition and issuing of these texts might itself become a way of reinforcing the corporate ideology of such groups. Representative examples of such a process are to be found in the circulation of philosophical and religious verse within the Donne circle during the first three decades of the century, in the circulation of political tracts among the gentry of Kent during the decades prior to the civil war, in Henry King's production of collections of his own and others' poems at Christ Church Oxford, and in the production of miscellanies of the work of the court poets of Charles I. 11 In each of these instances, the aim of circulation was not to broadcast verse out to an indiscriminate public (though this sometimes happened over a period of years) so much as to use the exchange of writings in manuscript as a way of maintaining the coherence of a community which might well be a political or religious as well as a literary entity. In the cases of Donne and King, we see collections exchanged among groups of friends sharing religious and philosophic interests, but also concerned to advance each others' careers and to ease the path to patronage. 12 In that of the Kentish squires the exchange of manuscripts was helping to sustain a regional political structure whose members due to their scholarly interests and proximity to the capital were especially sensitive to ideological questions. 13 This "bonding" role of scribal transmission might require that the material so circulated should be of a kind to deter outsiders who might happen to encounter it. A student of Restoration poetry, if asked why such a collection as Osborn b. 105 should initially have been reserved for scribal transmission, would probably say because it was against the law to print obscene literature. But this in turn raises the question why obscene literature gets written in the first place—or did in the seventeenth century. An answer to the latter question would be that the poetry of Rochester and his friends, published, as far as they were able to ensure, entirely in manuscript, was an ideological consciousness-raising exercise among a dissident political interest group at the court of Charles II. As regards the nature of this group, one must begin with the observation that although Rochester is the best represented poet and the obvious star of the collection (much as Carew had been in the miscellanies from the court of Charles I), Osborn b. 105 is in fact a composite anthology drawing on work from a number of writers, several of whom were friends of Rochester, others clients, and some enemies. The friends were members of a court faction among a number of other factions, composed of the Duke of Buckingham, the Earls of Rochester and Dorset, Sir Charles Sedley, Henry Savile, Fleetwood Shepherd, William Wycherley, George Etherege and a few hangers-on. Among the professional writers the one most consistently in receipt of their patronage was Thomas Shadwell, who by 1680 had dedicated Timon to Buckingham, The Miser to Dorset (the first of three such dedications) and A True Widow to Sedley, who was also reputed to assist him with the polishing of his plays. Buckingham, Dorset, Wycherley, Shadwell and Etherege are all represented in the compilation. Sedley's name occurs at a number of points in it and he may also be present as the author of either of two works of disputed authorship—"In the fields of Lincoln's Inn" and "Timon." All those named are included by Rochester in the roll-call of his literary friends at the end of "An Allusion to Horace" which can be seen as a kind of manifesto on behalf of the group: I loath the Rabble, 'tis enough for me, If Sidley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Witcherley, Godolphin, Buttler, Buckhurst, Buckingham, And some few more, whom I omit to name Approve my Sense, I count their Censure Fame. 14 The faction admired Dryden up to a point but were strongly opposed to his politics. Besides he represented the new principled professionalism of the man of letters which challenged their aristocratic cult of amateurism and improvisation. 15 "An Allusion to Horace" and Buckingham's The Rehearsal give us their view of him. Although Rochester was the star writer, the political leader of the group was Buckingham, and their ideologue, Buckingham's long-term adviser, Andrew Marvell. They were thus Whig placemen in a Tory court, sceptical in religion but anti-Catholic in politics, French in culture but by now pro-Dutch in foreign policy, boon companions of the king yet resentful of the power of those unconstitutional ministers of state, his mistresses. They had been important to the king as a counterpoise to the partisans of his brother, James, Duke of York, but by 1680 they had lost his confidence through their links with Shaftesbury's campaign to exclude James from the succession. These matters are uncontroversial (except perhaps the role of Marvell) and the evidence for them has been available for many years in a series of studies by John Harold Wilson. 16 Poetry, along with sceptical philosophy and practical debauchery, was the bonding agent of a group whose ultimate rationale was political—the Erastian, anti-clerical wing of Shaftesbury's exclusionist alliance—and which through the influence of Buckingham, Dorset and Sedley was to play a significant part in bringing about the great political change of 1688. However, they differed from Shaftesbury in preferring William of Orange to Monmouth as heir in the place of James. This group is the first and most important of the literary communities who contributed material to Osborn b. 105. To understand the next stage of the argument it will be helpful to turn to another model from the earlier Stuart period, that of the circulation of miscellanies of poems by Henry King and his friends produced under King's direction at Christ Church, Oxford during the 1630s. In an important unpublished dissertation by Mary Hobbs, the creation and dissemination of these collections is followed in exemplary detail. 17 To begin with they were intended for Christ Church readers and King's immediate circle of friends and performed, for that community, the bonding function already described in connection with Donne and the Kentish squires. It was not long, however, before they were also being copied in other Oxford colleges and then in London, where the Inns-of-Court, always an important centre for scribal publication, proved exceptionally receptive. 18 As this happened the contents of the collections were modified to accommodate the expectations of their new readerships. Hobbs's discussion, by relating changes in the contents of miscellanies to evidence of hands, scribes, owners and personal links between individuals who were connected in all these capacities with the manuscripts, shows how collections similar to MS1680H and Osborn b. 105 would vary not only through time but as a result of movement from community to community. In the case of the 1680 collections we possess neither the rich body of scribal recensions nor the knowledge of provenances that provide the basis for Hobbs's work; but guided by her conclusions we can suggest further levels of communal affiliation within the collection. A second community that contributed items was also based at court. During the second half of the 1670s the proto-Whig Buckingham faction was challenged by another which was strongly Yorkist in its sympathies, headed by the Earl of Mulgrave and with Dryden as its professional luminary. Sir Carr Scroope seems also to have been associated with it for a while, though the reference to him in Mulgrave and Dryden's "An Essay on Satyr" of 1679 is an unflattering one. 19 Vieth has shown in detail how a substantial body of poems in the 1680 compilation were inspired by this antagonism. 20 An important show of strength of the Mulgrave group was the production in March 1677 of Nathaniel Lee's The Rival Queens , dedicated to Mulgrave and with a prologue by Scroope and commendatory verses by Dryden. Both versions of the collection contain attacks of particular virulence on Mulgrave and Scroope, while "An Allusion to Horace" contains a stinging reference to Mulgrave as Dryden's "foolish patron." Dryden counter-attacked in the preface to All for Love and assisted Mulgrave with the "Essay on Satyr" in which Buckingham, Dorset, Sedley and Rochester are assailed in the company of Shaftesbury, Halifax and Lord Chancellor Finch. Vieth was the first scholar to sort out the motivations and targets of the satires directed at Mulgrave and Scroope; but even he did not seem to grasp the political dimension of the exchanges or to understand that the allegiances of Absalom and Achitophel , in which Buckingham is demolished as Zimri and Mulgrave lauded as Adriel, were already overt in Osborn b. 105. (Basil Greenslade in his discussion of Rochester's political convictions has fallen into a similar error. 21 ) The viewpoint of the Mulgrave faction is represented in the collection by three items (all by Scroope) which appear in both Osborn b. 105 and 1680H —"In defence of Satyr," "Raile on poor feeble Scribler" and "I cannot change as others doe" along with a further four which appear only among the eleven additional poems in Osborn b. 105. These are a poem by Mulgrave himself, "On the Enjoyment of his M rs " ("Since now my Silvia, is as kind as faire"), Dryden's "Mac Flecknoe"—an attack by the leading professional of one faction on the leading professional of the other—and two vicious attacks on Buckingham, "A New Ballad to an Old Tune Call'd Sage Leafe" and the "D: of B: Letany." The presence of these pieces is significant for what it tells us about the intended audience of the two texts. Although the greater part of the compilation derives from the Buckingham faction, members of this faction would not wish to circulate poems by Mulgrave and his friends which were uncomplimentary to themselves. (The reverse would also apply.) This makes it likely that the core collection underlying 1680H and Osborn b. 105 was reedited outside the court by someone who, while obviously having a good source of supply within the Buckingham faction, felt no personal involvement in its squabbles and was quite happy to mingle work by members of both factions. 1680H is less offensive in this regard, since each of the three poems by Scroope, which are its only contribution from the opposition, is neutralised by an "answer." "I cannot change" is cruelly burlesqued as "I swive as well as others do"; "In defence of Satyr" is followed by the crushing "To wrack and torture thy unmeaning Brayne"; and "Raile on poor feeble Scribler" receives its comeuppance from "On Poet Ninny." (In the last of these cases, the reply is not part of the linked group containing the earlier parts of the exchange, and has become attached to another group satirising Mulgrave. However, it is likely that both it and Buckingham's satire on Scroope, "A Familiar Epistle to M r Julian Secretary of the Muses," which follows it in Osborn b. 105 were meant to belong with the earlier Rochester-Scroope exchange.) This difference between the two collections must be regarded as supporting evidence for the hypothesis advanced earlier that the edition represents a prior state of the collection to Osborn b. 105. On the other hand, the case can not be pushed very far. Mac Flecknoe and "Since now my Silvia" are both long poems, in addition to being by authors other than Rochester, and a publisher of Whiggish inclination might have had his own reasons for suppressing satires on Buckingham. The remaining seven poems unique to Osborn b. 105 pose no such difficulties, being of a kind that might easily have appealed to members of the Buckingham faction. 22 The third communal affiliation is with one of the Inns of Court. Among the poems common to both the printed and the manuscript versions of the compilation are four which can be linked to Gray's Inn: two of these are by Alexander Radcliffe, who entered the Inn in November 1669, and two by Aphra Behn, whose lover John Hoyle had enjoyed a long connection with the Inn before moving in January 1679 to the Inner Temple. 23 The Behn poems are a light piece of erotic verse "On a Giniper Tree now cut down to make Busks" and an elegy on the painter John Greenhill, a member of the same dissolute half-world inhabited by Hoyle. 24 Osborn b. 105 adds a third poem, "One day the amorous Lysander." In this case, as Vieth pointed out, Behn is known on the basis of a letter first printed in 1718 to have sent a copy of the poem to Hoyle. (Maureen Duffy has cast doubt on the authenticity of the letter but on grounds which I believe to be questionable. 25 ) Hoyle is known to have been a friend of Sedley, who was also a Whig, a freethinker and a libertine. Hoyle's murder by a Tory zealot in May 1692 was to draw from Sedley the bitter "A Ballad to the Tune of Bateman." Could Hoyle, a legal man active in literary and libertine circles, with contacts at court and with easy access to professional scriveners, have been connected with the compiling of Osborn b. 105? It is impossible to tell, but the theory of an Inns-of-Court provenance for the manuscript is attractive not only because it would place it in a line of such compilations reaching back to Donne's days at Lincoln's Inn, but would also explain how discriminations which would have been of vital interest to a partisan court readership would no longer be felt to apply. Of course if Duffy is right in questioning the authenticity of the 1718 letter, the evidence for Hoyle's involvement is seriously weakened and with it that for a distinct "Gray's Inn" stage in the evolution of the collection. Here the crucial issue is that at a point which can not yet be determined the burgeoning collection ceased to be a private possession and came into the hands of a professional publisher of manuscripts. While a miscellany still in private hands would grow in ways dictated by the communal affiliations of successive copyists, a professional trader in lampoons would acknowledge no such restrictions but aim at presenting a mix of materials from different sources aimed at attracting the widest possible readership. At this point the assumptions underlying Hobbs's method would cease to apply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Our concern so far has been with the literary genesis of the collection: it is now time to consider its production in scribal and printed form, beginning with the edition and then looking more searchingly at the manuscript. The printing of 1680H is commonly regarded as a surreptitious, hole-in-the-corner affair, undertaken by a printer who had fortuitously come into the possession of a manuscript and was cashing in on its saleability as a work of pornography. To Vieth it is "the printer" who is responsible for the changes he maintains were made to the copy and who therefore must have been undertaking the work on his own account rather than at the direction of a bookseller. This pattern of work is not unknown and might be particularly suspected of a surreptitious operation; but it also required that the printer should finance the work, paying initially for the paper (a very substantial expense) and carrying the manpower costs of printing in the hope of recouping them from sales which he himself would have to negotiate with stationers or hawkers. These costs were likely to be steep as workmen required higher wages to work on illegal publications, which often involved printing in the early hours of the morning. It also required that the printer should himself run the risk of warehousing the stock and protecting it against seizure. All this might be worth the trouble to a well-organised master printer with good contacts in the retail trade and reasonable reserves of capital, but is a departure from the normal practice of the trade which was for the bookseller to initiate publication and the printer to work to an agreed quotation, which in the case of an illegal publication would be a higher than usual one. Paper under these circumstances would be ordered in by the bookseller in the amount required for the edition. It should also be noted that a bookseller would not necessarily have to go to a back-street or unlicensed printer to get illegal work printed. Documents presented to a House of Lords enquiry in 1675 make it clear that leading stationers drove a thriving trade in unlicensed publications and would blackmail their regular printers into printing them with threats of harassment by the Stationers' Company or of withdrawing orders for legitimate work. 26 Whatever the situation with the first edition of 1680H , it is obvious that the work became an enormous best-seller. In one of the classic demonstrations of modern bibliographical scholarship, James Thorpe showed that what up till his time had been accepted as seventeen copies of a single edition were in fact representative of ten separate editions with the existence of others inferable from the analysis of variants. 27 (One of these hypothesised editions has since come to light. 28 ) It is also likely that some editions have disappeared without trace. Whichever way one looks at the matter, and however long these editions took to appear (they are all dated 1680 but this is no more true than their claim to be printed at Antwerp), the book was one of the great publishing successes of the Restoration period. A question which was not asked by Thorpe but which is germane to the present discussion is how this huge body of copies was distributed to its readers. To this there is only one possible answer. A printing operation on this scale could not have been disposed of by hawkers: the book must have been handled, albeit surreptitiously, as a regular item of trade by a considerable body of booksellers and with the tacit approval of the Stationers' Company. The moment this possibility is raised it becomes even less likely that the initial printing was the happy inspiration of a side-alley printer. It must have been obvious in the autumn of 1680 that a collection of Rochester's poems would be a hot property. Leading booksellers would have known where a manuscript and a printer were to be obtained and how to remove the danger of suppression by offering their colleagues of the Company a slice of the action. To take this argument any further would be to trespass on important findings by John Hetet on the printing and distribution of prohibited books which still await publication. 29 Hetet's concern was with nonconformist political writings, not with libertine literature, but the detailed picture he gives of the workings of this particular underground and its substantial contribution to the profitability of the book trade casts light at every turn on the methods by which 1680H will have been produced and circulated. The point of concern to the present argument is that, if the book was commissioned by a bookseller in the normal way of trade, any cutting will have been done by him rather than by the printer, and will have been determined by the time paper was ordered for the edition. We would not be thinking of ad hoc cuts made as the paper supply dwindled. The writing of the manuscript needs also to be set against a background of trade practice for such undertakings. It has become common for scholars of Restoration poetry to refer loosely to "scriptoria" as the agencies of publication; but this is once again to sever the manufacture of the text from its distribution and the likelihood that it would be the distributor rather than the scribe who financed and initiated production. There can be no doubt for a start that much of the trade in manuscripts was in the hands of booksellers. An important testimony to this is a document by Sir Roger L'Estrange, presented to the House of Lords in 1675, of which a precis is given in a Historical Manuscripts Commission Report, but which is here reproduced in full from the original in the House of Lords Record Office: The Question of Libells, extends it selfe (I conceive) to manuscripts, as well as Prints; as beeing the more mischievous of the Two for they are com͂only so bitter, and dangerous, that not one of forty of them ever comes to y e Presse, and yet by y e help of Transcripts, they are well nigh as Publique. For the preventing, and suppressing of Printed Libells, I shall only desire such a generall warrant from his Maty: and Councill, as I have formerly had, to support mee in the Execution of my Duty. And for Libells in Writing, I do humbly offer this to Consideration. That although Copyes of them may passe indifferently from one to another, by other hands, yet some certain Stationers are supposed to bee y e chiefe, and profest dealers in them, as having some Affinity with their Trade. And when they come to bee detected, the Com͂on pretence is, They were left in my shopp , or sent in a Letter , I know not by whom : which may be true in some cases, though but a shift, for y e greater Part. In the former case, The stationers may be ordered to call a Hall, and administer an Oath to all their members, neither directly, nor Indirectly, to Countenance, disperse, publish, Print or Cause to bee Printed any such Libells. And secondly, for a Generall Provision; whoever shall receive, and Conceale any such Libell, without giving notice thereof, to some of his Matyes Justices, within a certain space of time after the receipt of it; let him suffer as an Abettour of it, &amp; if he shall not produce y e person of whom he had it, let him suffer as y e Authour of it. 30 An oddity of this report is that much of its phraseology is taken over from a similar document of 1662, and therefore presumably also composed by L'Estrange. 31 Allowance must also be made for the writer's longstanding feud with the Stationers' Company. However, as will be seen in a moment there is corroborative evidence for his account of the state of affairs. A bookseller did not need to go to the trouble of maintaining a scriptorium: instead he could order job lots of copies from a scrivener. 32 Scriveners were particularly thick on the ground in the areas close to the law courts and the Inns-of-Court. The work pattern of those most closely associated with the courts would see them heavily occupied during the legal terms but with slack periods during the vacations during which they would need to look for other kinds of copying. 33 The concentration of young law students, many with literary tastes and some themselves writers, in the neighbourhood of the Inns provided a ready market for scribally published collections of verse. If one was to guess at the most likely circumstances for the production of a volume such as Osborn b. 105 it would be a commission from a bookseller in one of the streets close to the Inns—the Strand, Fleet Street, Chancery Lane or High Holborn—to a neighbouring scrivener made during the summer law vacation of 1680. However, scriptoria did exist and we are fortunate in a spy's report of 1675, first published by Andrew Browning, to have a description of one in full blast. John Starkey and Thomas Collins at their respective shops strategically close to the Middle Temple Gate had in the mid 1670s become chief suppliers of parliamentary papers and political "separates" to the Whig party: To these Shops . . . every afternoon doe repair severall sorts of People. 1. Young Lawyers of both the Temples and the other Inns of Court, who here generally receive their tincture and corruption. 2. Ill-affected Citizens of all sorts. 3. Ill-affected Gentry. 4. The Emissaries and Agents of the severall parties and Factions about Town. Against the time of their coming, the Masters of those Shops, have a grand Book or Books, wherein are Registred ready for them, all or most of the forenamed perticulars; which they dayly produce to these sorts of people to be read; and then, if they please, they either carry away Copies, or bespeak them against another day: These take care to communicate them by Letter all over the Kingdom, and by Conversation throughout the City and Suburbs. The like Industry is used by the Masters of those Shops, who, together with their Servants, are every afternoon and night busied in Transcribing Copies, with which they drive a Trade all over the Kingdom. 34 The report does not mention poetry as among the products of these scriptoria but is of great interest for its insight into scribal publication as it was organised on a commercial basis by established booksellers. The reference to "a grand Book or Books" suggests that the original function of the large lampoon miscellanies may not have been as objects of sale in their own right but as "samplers" from which a customer could order copies of individual items or an agreed selection of poems. (One sign of such a volume would be an unpredictable alternation of hands, as is the case with Harvard MS Eng. 636F.) To Starkey and Collins as operators of scriptoria must be added the better-known figure of Robert Julian, the retired naval clerk who figures so largely in the satires which were written for him to distribute. 35 The chief difference between Julian's operation and that of Starkey and Collins was the method of distribution. Whereas the booksellers' customers came to their shops to place orders and collect manuscripts, Julian was a mobile vendor of lampoons, waiting personally on his clients in the court and the coffeehouses, and apparently leaving the actual transcribing to the "two clerks" mentioned by Ravenscroft in the prologue to The London Cuckolds . 36 Julian is, however, mentioned several times as a retailer of "books" and had close connections with the Buckingham circle. A letter from him to Dorset is extant, dateable to 1675-77, and in June 1666 he would have made the acquaintance of Rochester who served on the same ship during the Four Days Battle against the Dutch. 37 It is highly likely that he was responsible for the production and sale of some of the surviving manuscript miscellanies but it cannot be assumed for that reason that he rather than a bookseller or a private collector with access to professional copyists was responsible for commissioning Osborn b. 105 and its lost sibling. The efficiency with which the collection was moved into print, taken together with the possibility that this may have involved concerted activity from the trade, would rather point towards a stationer in one of the streets already mentioned who combined dealing in manuscripts with the publication and sale of printed books. Certainly the printing of the collection can have had nothing to do with Julian to whom it was only of value as long as it was kept from the press. So far we are still multiplying possibilities without possessing any criterion to judge between them; but as regards the date of writing and the circumstances under which the manuscript was written we are now able to make use of an important clue, so far disregarded. This is the name "Hansen" written on the lower right-hand corner of the title page in a hand which Vieth thought might be that of the second scribe. The name is rare enough in England (as opposed to the usual "Hanson") to suggest that it refers to the diplomat Friedrich Adolphus Hansen, who visited England in September 1680 in the entourage of Charles, the electoral prince Palatine. 38 The presence of two other important Rochester manuscripts in continental libraries indicates that they may have been attractive as souvenirs to visiting dignitaries. 39 In Hansen's case it is possible to suggest additional reasons for his wishing to acquire the collection and why in the end it may have failed to accompany him back to the Palatinate. There is no reason to believe that a German visitor to England at this period would have known any English, but at Whitehall and Newmarket which he visited in the company of the king and the electoral prince he would have been able to communicate with members of the court in French, and at Oxford, where he was awarded a D.C.L. on 9 September, he would have been able to converse with members of the university in Latin. At both places he is likely to have heard of the wicked earl and great poet who had died only two months earlier as an exemplary penitent. At Oxford he might have met clergy who had attended Rochester during the closing weeks of his life. The story may also have come to the ears of the electoral prince, a young man of exemplary learning and, through his descent from Elizabeth of Bohemia, a cousin of Charles II. In either case, and whether for reasons of piety or notoriety, an attempt might plausibly have been made to obtain a collection of Rochester's verse, the enquirer been directed to the source of supply (presumably well known at Whitehall), and a manuscript been written and inscribed with Hansen's name, indicating that it had been personally bespoke by him. (This practice is also encountered in Leeds University Library MS Brotherton Lt 54.) 40 While there are reasons to believe that the manuscript was written for Hansen, there is also a reason why it may never have been collected. On 11 September, the news reached the electoral prince at Whitehall that his father had died and that he was now Elector. Further plans for the visit were now abandoned as the party prepared for an immediate return to the Palatinate and on the 18th they set sail from Greenwich. The collection of a manuscript will not have been a matter of great concern at such a period, and the supplier would hardly be interested in sending it overseas when ready money could be obtained in London for such a desirable item. This hypothesis implies that the manuscript was a commercial production, and that, as late as September 1680, 1680H was still unavailable. (Our first definite evidence of its existence is in the following November. 41 ) What has been presented is for the most part offered not as a series of conclusions but as possibilities for scholars to work with as they try to make further sense of the evidence. I regard the case for a rolling archetype, as opposed to Vieth's static model, as no more than evenly balanced and have tried not to draw on it to support other proposals. The case for the final editing of the compilation having taken place in the Inns of Court is dependent on a further assumption of its still being a private possession at that stage. If it was not, there is still a strong likelihood of its having been assembled by a trader in the streets adjacent to those venerable institutions. That the bulk of the compilation emanated from manuscripts privately circulated within the Buckingham faction seems to me beyond doubt; but the mingling in of work from the Mulgrave faction in Osborn b. 105 shows that by then it had moved out to a wider community. The argument that the manuscript was written for F. A. Hansen is supported by the coincidence of dates, the fact that two similar collections also left England and the lack of any other candidate. The suggestion that the publication of 1680H may have been a less disreputable operation than has formerly been assumed again points towards the possibility that a bookseller near the Inns of Court may have been responsible for the production first of the manuscript and, as orders began to flood in, of the edition. How many of these guesses are accurate can not be determined on the presently available evidence, but at the very least they point to new questions to be asked of a document which is in many ways the key to our understanding of a whole literary culture.</field>

Mac Flecknoe is followed by an anti-Dryden lampoon credited to Shadwell. Dorset's "Colon" is a Whig lampoon on the royal mistresses.

      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of Sanctus Tewdricus : Rediscovery of a "Lost Miracle Play" from St. Omers by Stephen K. Wright *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Histories of early English drama frequently mention a lost miracle play on the life of St. Tewdricus of Wales. The work first came to the attention of theatre historians in 1919, when George R. Coffman included it in his list of medieval performance records. Coffman speculated that the play of St. Tewdricus may have been staged in Bangor, but did not assign a definite date to this supposed performance. 1 More recently, the play has been included in lists of Middle English miracle plays compiled by Hardin Craig, Alfred Harbage, and David M. Bevington, all of whom depend on Coffman as their authority. 2 In fact, Coffman's description of the play of St. Tewdricus was not based on firsthand knowledge of the text, but relied instead on an entry in the 1876 report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. The inventory of the library of Reginald Cholmondeley of Condover Hall, Shropshire, mentions a quarto volume containing a fragmentary copy of Alfred of Beverley's Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae , miscellaneous letters by Bishop Lloyd, John Selden, and others, and the text of a "Latin play with the title 'Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor bonus, Rex et Martyr,' in 9 scenes." 3 Alfred J. Horwood, who surveyed the Condover House library over a century ago, was thus the last person to examine the volume containing the play of St. Tewdricus. There are no reports of any firsthand studies of the manuscript after Horwood's inventory of 1876. When Reginald Cholmondeley's books were sold at auction on 24 November 1887, the play was essentially lost to theatre historians. The purpose of this paper is to report the rediscovery of the manuscript and to offer a general introduction to its contents and provenance. The volume containing Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus is now in the archives of the Cheshire Record Office, where it is catalogued as Crewe Cowper Collection, ref DCC 13. 4 It is impossible to say precisely when the play was bound into this miscellaneous collection of chronicles and letters, but it must have been sometime before 9 November 1701, when, according to a note on the flyleaf, the book passed from the library of Dr. Humphrey Humphreys, bishop of Bangor, into the hands of an unidentified owner known to us only as "R. D." 5 Humphreys, a renowned Celtic scholar who was "excellently well versed in the antiquities of Wales," evidently had the play bound into his copy of Alfred of Beverley's Annales and then donated it to "R. D." when he was translated from Bangor to the see of Hereford in November 1701. 6 A bookplate affixed to the inside cover indicates that in the early eighteenth century the volume came into the possession of William Cowper of Colne, Lancashire, the last known owner of the book until its appearance in the Cholmondeley family library at Condover House. The play itself is the only item preserved in a paper manuscript consisting of thirty-four leaves. The leaves measure 15 cm in width and 20 cm in length; they are untrimmed and bound in their original order. A cover sheet (fol. 1r) bears the inscription "Ad Maiore m Dei Gloria m ," a clear indication that the play is a product of the Jesuit order. The scribe has embellished this motto with ornate and highly fanciful penwork. The upper loop of the G , for example, is decorated with frondlike flourishes which frame the names "Iesus," "Maria," "Ioseph," "Ignatius," and "Ludovicus." At the bottom of the page there is a crudely drawn winged angel's head flanked by a pair of coiled serpents. Beneath this rough emblem stands the name of the play-book's principal copyist: "Henricus Matthaeus Chamberling Scripsit." The title page (fol. 2r) reads as follows: Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus— Drama— Argumentu m — Sanc tus Tewdricus Regiâ dignitate in filiu m collatâ, Siluru m in Britanniâ Regno propinqua m solitudine m praetulerat; intulerunt interim cu m Idolatriâ Bellu m Saxones; sed in Regnu m Mauricu m fidemq ue reduxit hostibus caesis ijs tame n acceptis pro grege vulneribus, quibus in acie bonus Pastor occubuit. Godn: [?] in comment: Epis: Angliae Scena est in Glamorganniâ Personae S anc tus Tewdricus Rex et Martyr Mauricus Rex Siluru m Arthurus eius frater Malcolmus } Maurico } } } chari Proceres Ulfadus } Arthuro } Sigertus } Otho } Saxonu m Duces Fridericus } Angelus Brittanniae Tutelaris A final preliminary page (fol. 2v) briefly outlines the plot and ends with a colophon that again points to the Jesuit origin of the work: "Ad maiore m Dei et S anc ti Ignatij gloria m ." The text of the play runs from fol. 3r to fol. 28v. At the end of each of the play's nine scenes one finds an underlined name offset so as to be flush with the right margin. Since a note on fol. 2v indicates that the creation of the play was a collaborative effort ("Composuêre Poetae"), it is safe to conclude that these are the names of the joint authors, each of whom was responsible for one short episode. The nine companions who wrote Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus are Richardus Simonis (fol. 5r), Gulielmus Parraeus (fol. 7v), Richardus Smithaeus (fol. 9r), Franciscus Simonis (fol. 11v), Daniel Giffordus (fol. 14r), Henricus Chamberlingus (fol. 16v), Carolus Peeters (fol. 21r), Thomas Beveridge (fol. 26r), and Nicholaus Tempest (fol. 28v). Their identities will be discussed in detail below. The group designated Henry Matthew Chamberling, the author of the sixth episode, to decorate the cover sheet and transcribe the final fair copy of their work. The body of the play (fol. 3r-28v) is copied out fair from lost originals in Chamberling's graceful and uniformly legible cursive script. He regularly employs only two abbreviations: a double loop on the descender of the letter q to indicate the enclitic conjunction - que , and a sweeping suspension mark to represent a final m following a penultimate vowel. There are twenty-three lines of text per page. Rubrics designating the speaker stand in the left margin. Chamberling also provides line numbers in the left margin to mark every tenth line, which, in conjunction with other evidence to be discussed below, suggests that the manuscript was meant to be used as a stage director's script or promptbook. There are two notable inaccuracies. The first instance is a mistake on fol. 19v, where the line count skips from 750 to 780. Since no lines are missing from the passage in question, the error is simply one of faulty enumeration. A second and far more interesting lapse occurs in scene eight. In this case, the line count breaks off after line 974 (fol. 24v) and resumes with line 975 (fol. 26r). Here, the interruption in the enumeration coincides exactly with a passage assigned to the Angelus Brittanniae Tutelaris. The angel's speech consists of thirty-five elegiac couplets which are numbered separately from the rest of the text. Moreover, this passage is the only one in the entire play that lacks a carefully justified left margin; here, every other line is deeply indented to call attention to the fact that the speech is written in couplets. The interruption of the normal line count, the indentation of alternate lines, and the unusual nature of the verse form all suggest that the speech of Britain's guardian angel is a later addition to a pre-existing play. After inserting the new speech, Chamberling simply returned to the enumeration and page layout of his source. Chamberling's transcription of the play of St. Tewdricus was later revised by several contemporary hands. The changes and additions are of three kinds. First, several unknown revisers have made minor interlinear corrections to individual words, phrases, and speech-prefixes. Second, a writer characterized by a heavier and more compact cursive hand than that of Henry Chamberling has added marginal notes to specify entrances and exits, stage business, and the use of props (fol. 3r, 4r, 5r, 6r, 6v, 11r, 11v, 13v, 15r, 15v, 16v, 17r, 18r, 22v, 28r). These stage directions are obviously included for the benefit of a director or prompter, thus providing additional evidence that the play was intended for actual performance rather than private reading. Third, several lengthy speeches and songs have been appended to Chamberling's script for inclusion at various points in the play. These additions consist of the lyrics and complete notation to a song composed by Thomas Beveridge for the end of scene four (fol. 28v-31r), a speech and song performed at the end of scene seven by a new character known as "Genius Sylvae" (fol. 32r-32v), and two prose interludes—a "Diludium" and "Diludium secundum"—to be performed during the course of scene seven and at the end of scene eight (fol. 33r-34r). What is more, these substantial additions also show signs of having been corrected by a still later hand. Taken together, this evidence establishes that Sanctus Tewdricus was revised for repeated performances on several different occasions. In order to assess the aims, methods, and achievements of any history play, it is necessary to examine the work in the light of the source materials available to its maker. The only surviving account of the life of Tewdricus (Tewdrig ap Teithfall) is found in the Liber Landavensis (the Book of Llandaff), where one learns that he was a fifth or sixth-century prince of Glamorgan who abdicated in favor of his son Mauricus (Meurig) to become a hermit at Tintern. 7 When the west country was attacked by Saxons, an angel instructed Tewdricus to lead his people in battle. Tewdricus and his followers defeated the invaders at Tintern ford on the river Wye, but the holy man was mortally wounded by a Saxon spear. The next morning a cart drawn by two stags appeared outside his door to carry him to the beautiful meadow where he was destined to die. Miraculous springs flowed forth wherever the stags stopped to rest along the way. When Tewdricus finally arrived at the meadow of Echni, the cart burst asunder and he ordered the stags to run free again. The saint then commended his soul to God and died. Meurig buried his father at Merthyr Tewdrig (Mathern), where he is still venerated as patron of the parish church. The brief synopsis that appears on the title page of the Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus (fol. 2r) is consistent with the tale recounted above, thus leading one to suspect at the outset that the play's action must be closely patterned on the legend recorded in the Liber Landavensis . However, the plot departs from the legend in so many important respects that it is very likely that other sources were consulted as well. The play opens in the Welsh camp, where Mauricus reads a letter informing him that a Saxon attack is imminent and that his younger brother Arthurus, who is not even mentioned by the Llandaff chronicler, has joined the ranks of the enemy. Mauricus agonizes over Arthurus' defection and eventually decides to abdicate in his brother's favour in order to spare his homeland from the ravages of war. Malcolmus encourages the prince to resist, reminding him of the injuries his people and his hermit father would suffer under the godless Saxons. Mauricus agrees to send Malcolmus to his brother incognito in order to negotiate a settlement; meanwhile, he will summon the troops to fight if necessary. The second scene is set in the Saxon camp, where Sigertus, Fridericus, and Otho boast of their victories over the Christians. Arthurus is horrified when the three warlords begin stabbing a crucifix that they have hurled to the ground. Sigertus mocks Arthurus' futile protests and, when the prince tries to dissuade them from their sacrilege, he stabs Arthurus in the hands. In scene three, Arthurus' companion Ulfadus comes to summon him to the battle against his kinsmen. Arthurus swears vengeance against Fridericus and convinces Ulfadus to go to the Welsh camp and beg for forgiveness. Tewdricus' hermitage is the setting for scene four. The Angel of the Forest calls upon the reluctant saint to leave the beauty and silence of the woods for the tumult and agony of the battlefield. The Guardian Angel of Britain announces that the trees will soon confirm this divine decree, and the Angel of the Forest promises to become invisible and follow the saint to war. Tewdricus hesitates until the green leaves of a nearby oak suddenly wither and a laurel branch is miraculously transformed into a crown. Music fills the air as Tewdricus takes up his armor. The scene shifts to the battlefield, where Malcolmus, who has failed to reach the Saxon camp, wanders in aimless panic. The Angel of Britain announces that the Welsh army has been routed and that Mauricus is prepared to surrender to the usurpers. Malcolmus casts aside his shield and helmet in despair. When Ulfadus appears, Malcolmus expects to be killed. Instead, Ulfadus reports that Arthurus has renounced his allegiance to the Saxons and wishes to return home. The sixth scene finds Fridericus in pursuit of Mauricus. Ulfadus returns from the front and encourages Arthurus with the news that his brother still lives. Arthurus beheads Fridericus, puts the gory trophy and the fallen crucifix into a bag, and prepares to flee the Saxon camp. In scene seven, Arthurus, Mauricus, and Tewdricus meet by chance in the woods. After a tearful reunion, the saint inspires his sons to launch a counterattack. In the Saxon camp, Sigertus and Otho swear to commemorate the death of Fridericus by massacring the Welsh. After their exit, the Angel of Britain describes the offstage battle. He announces that Mauricus leads the Welsh to victory while Arthurus expiates his guilt with his sword. In the closing scene, Malcolmus again meets Ulfadus on the battlefield. Fearing that Ulfadus will try to trick him to escape capture by the Welsh, the cowardly Malcolmus kills his erstwhile friend. Sigertus surrenders to Tewdricus. Arthurus urges that the defeated king be put to death, but Tewdricus orders that he be spared. The treacherous Saxon stabs Arthurus, and Tewdricus dies of wounds he has suffered in battle. Clearly, the play preserves a much more detailed and spectacular account of the life of Tewdricus than the version of the Liber Landavensis . The baroque style of the verse is matched by the elaboration of a plot featuring the pathos of potential fratricide, horrifying acts of sacrilege, disguised messengers, angelic lyrics, miraculous omens and apparitions, a gruesome decapitation, the return of the apostate child, and the death of the saintly father-king at his moment of triumph. Where did these additions come from? Given the assumption that our nine playwrights would not have felt free to populate their pious history play with quite so many invented characters and episodes, it seems likely that the play is based at least in part on oral traditions that are now lost to us. As we shall see below, it is even possible to make a reasonable guess as to the identity of the individual who persuaded his fellow playwrights to dramatize (and perhaps elaborate) legendary material from his native Wales. The question still remains as to the provenance and performance history of the play of St. Tewdricus. Was it ever performed in Britain during the Middle Ages as Coffman, Craig, Harbage, and Bevington claim? Ian Lancashire was the first to question this assumption. In his recent survey of British performance records, Lancashire speculates that the work might not have been a medieval English play at all, but rather an early seventeenth-century play from the Jesuit academy at St. Omers in Spanish Flanders, a school for expatriate English Catholics founded in 1592. 8 Such plays are known to have existed at St. Omers from as early as 1597, and they continued to be presented there until the dissolution of the school in 1762. 9 The oldest surviving play from the school is a short Latin dialogue composed for performance on the feast of St. Thomas of Canterbury, 29 December 1599. 10 It resembles the play of St. Tewdricus in that it consists of a prologue, nine scenes, and an epilogue. As might be expected, the community of exiled Catholic scholars often drew their subject matter from English historical and hagiographical sources ranging from Bede to Camden and Stow. Over the years the amateur playwrights produced plays on Humphrey of Mercia, Guy of Warwick, King Oswy of Northumbria, King Kenelm of Mercia, King Sigibert of East Anglia, Edward the Confessor, St. Augustine of Canterbury, St. Alban, the martyrdom of Thomas More, the fall of Henry VI, the Battle of Hastings, and the rebellion of the Earl of Warwick and Perkin Warbeck. The St. Omers plays were all in Latin with the exception of three experimental works, one in English, one in French, and one in Greek. Even on the basis of this circumstantial evidence, one might well be tempted to concur with Lancashire's inspired guess as to the provenance of the play of St. Tewdricus. There is, however, far more solid evidence that proves beyond a doubt that the play of St. Tewdricus was produced at St. Omers in or very shortly before 1679. Even though the boys frequently adopted false names to avoid persecution at home, it is nevertheless possible to identify seven of the nine individuals named in connection with the play as students at St. Omers during the years 1678-1679. 11 (1) Thomas Beveridge, the author of the eighth scene and the composer of the music at the end of the play, was the alias of Thomas Eberson of Leicestershire (1660-1733), a student at the school from 1678 (or shortly before) until 1679. (2) Daniel Gifford was the alias of Daniel Coulster, son of Sir Joseph Coulster. He was a student at St. Omers from 1672 to 1679. (3) William Parry was the alias of William Conway of Flintshire (1659-1689), a student at St. Omers from about 1674 until 1679. Parry is the most likely member of the group to have suggested the idea of composing a play on the life of a folk hero from his native Wales. (4) Charles Peeters (d. 1690), the son of John and Elizabeth Petre of Fithelers, Essex, was enrolled at St. Omer until 1679. (5) Francis Simons was the alias of Francis Plowden (1662-1736), the son of Edmund and Penelope Plowden of Plowden Hall, Shropshire. It is not known when he arrived at St. Omers; he stayed until 1682. (6) Richard Simons' true name was Richard Plowden (d. 1729); he was the brother of Francis Plowden and was enrolled at St. Omers until 1679. (7) Richard Smith (1660-1735), the son of John Smith of Sussex, was a student at the school from 1673 to 1679. The other two names linked with the play in the Crewe Cowper manuscript are more difficult to trace. A Nicholas Tempest from Lancashire (c. 1631-1679) was at St. Omers from around 1649 until 1652 (Holt, p. 259), but his dates are far too early for him to have been one of the collaborators associated with our play. However, it must be remembered that Holt's list of students is far from complete. Unless a boy's name appears by chance in a surviving account book, prize list, letter book, or similar piece of archival material, it simply disappears from the historical record. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that no fewer than sixteen other boys named Tempest, many from a large Yorkshire family, are known to have studied at St. Omers and Bruges. The surname was also the alias of at least six students. Perhaps the lost Nicholas Tempest of the class of 1678 or 1679 was related to one of the Yorkshire students of that name, or perhaps Tempest was merely a cover name for an otherwise unknown boy. In light of what we know about Nicholas Tempest's seven fellow playwrights listed above, the latter possibility seems by far the more likely. Finally, although several students named Chamberlain attended St. Omers and others chose the surname as their alias (Holt, p. 61), there is no record of the Henry Matthew Chamberling who composed the play's sixth scene, transcribed the fair copy of the entire work, and decorated the title page. The most prominent member of the group thus remains its most mysterious one as well. In light of the well-established tradition at St. Omers of performing Latin plays based on English historical and hagiographical sources, there would seem to be little need to posit a specific occasion that might have given rise to the composition of the play of St. Tewdricus. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that the performance of a play honoring an otherwise obscure Welsh saint was intended as an oblique commentary on a crisis that wrought havoc among the English Catholic community and nearly brought the academy at St. Omers to ruin. From 10 December 1677 until his expulsion on 23 June 1678, the notorious Titus Oates (1649-1705) was a student at St. Omers (Holt, p. 195). After returning to London, Oates, whose vindictiveness was matched only by his talent for perjury, became the chief architect of the pretended discovery of the so-called Popish Plot. 12 On 8 October 1678, Oates appeared before the Privy Council and denounced a number of prominent Jesuits as traitors to the crown. He claimed that he had attended a meeting in London the previous spring where a group of conspirators had plotted to assassinate Charles II, launch a wholesale massacre of Protestants, and attempt a French-supported coup d'etat on behalf of the Catholic Duke of York. On the basis of these accusations, at least thirty-five priests and lay brothers were tried and executed. Of particular interest for our purposes is the case of Thomas Whitbread, the Jesuit Provincial in England, who along with four companions was denounced by Oates in October 1678 and brought to trial on 23 June 1679. Whitbread and three of his codefendants had been educated at St. Omers. 13 What is more, it is surely no coincidence that it was Whitbread himself who had dismissed Titus Oates from the school on moral grounds the previous summer. In December 1678 a deputation was sent to St. Omers to hear the evidence of the masters and boys, who swore that it was impossible for Oates to have discovered a conspiracy in London as he claimed, since he had in fact been in residence at the school on the day of the alleged meeting. During the trial itself, fourteen boys were sent to London to testify on Whitbread's behalf. Among them were two of the authors of our play, namely, William Parry (Conway) of Flintshire and Daniel Gifford (Coulster). 14 The unsettling experience of testifying before a crowd of hostile onlookers was made all the more traumatic for Gifford, who was arrested with two of his classmates "upon suspicion of being a priest," interrogated in the Tower by Sir William Waller, and only released by special petition so that he could testify at Whitbread's trial. 15 Whitbread and his companions were found guilty and executed at Tyburn in July 1679. The anti-Catholic hysteria aroused by the affair of the Popish Plot led to the persecution of others affiliated with St. Omers as well. Among them was Philip Evans, a Welsh priest and graduate of St. Omers, who was arrested in Glamorganshire in December 1678 and executed in Cardiff the following summer. 16 It is perhaps not too much to suggest that the 1679 performance of the play of St. Tewdricus, a Glamorganshire saint who defends his faithful Christian companions against the machinations of the idolatrous Saxons, was inspired by the boys' recent experiences in London and the news of the martyrdom of Philip Evans. This theory of the play's composition would also explain Henry Chamberling's cryptic note that the work was intended as a treatise for the bishops of England: "in comment um Epis copis Angliae" (fol. 2r). The rediscovery of the Sanctus Tewdricus manuscript has implications for students of both medieval and Restoration drama. To begin with, future histories of the early English stage will have to omit the Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus from the list of lost Middle English miracle plays. The Welsh hagiographical tradition from which the play draws its material is indeed an ancient one, but the text undoubtedly dates from the reign of Charles II. At the same time, the manuscript enlarges our understanding of a little-known category of seventeenth-century drama. Until now, the only dramas from St. Omers thought to have survived were the 1599 dialogue for the feast of Thomas à Becket, the three plays of William Banister, and the five tragedies of Fr. Joseph Simeon (Emmanuel Lobb) published in Liège in 1656. 17 There are no extant plays from the hand of Maurice Newport (Ewens) or P. Clarcus, the only other previously identified playwrights from the school (Chadwick, p. 136). To this scant number must now be added the Sanctus Tewdricus by the nine classmates of 1678-1679, seven of whom can be positively identified. Similarly, the interludes and songs accompanying Joseph Simeon's Zeno have long been thought to be the only surviving music from the theatre at St. Omers (Chadwick, p. 137 and Plate 3). In this regard, the discovery of Thomas Beveridge's score for the incidental music to Sanctus Tewdricus (fol. 28v-31r) can shed new light on the teaching and composition of music in the schools. Finally, the apparent connection between the anti-Catholic hysteria of 1678-1679 and the amateur playwrights' choice of subject matter demonstrates that school dramas could be far more than innocuous exercises for Prize Day. For all its extravagance and bombast, Sanctus Tewdricus sive Pastor Bonus is clearly the product of a genuine crisis. Inasmuch as St. Tewdricus' resistance to persecution mirrors the heroism of the school's recently martyred alumni and their youthful defenders, the original audience must surely have understood the play as a memorable commentary on the quality of their classmates' courage in the face of religious intolerance.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dating Fielding's Letters to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu by Martin C. Battestin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he was a young man trying to establish himself as a playwright, Henry Fielding turned for advice and assistance to his cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the celebrated bluestocking. Two letters from Fielding to Lady Mary survive, both from this early period. 1 One of these, dated "London, 7br 4" [i.e. September 4], explicitly concerns the darkest of his comedies, The Modern Husband , a copy of which Fielding sent her for her "Perusal" and "Judgment." The "Scenes," he explained, were "written on a Model I never yet attempted," and he was therefore "exceedingly anxious least they should find less Mercy from you than my lighter Productions." Though Fielding did not specify the year in which he wrote this letter, scholars have confidently placed it in 1730; for The Craftsman of 19 September 1730 announced that the play was then ready for staging and that it "is said to bear a great Reputation." The Modern Husband , which was not in fact staged until the following season, appears to have circulated in manuscript in September 1730, and Lady Mary would have been among the first to receive a copy. Twice in his published works Fielding hints that she cordially approved the play. 2 Scholars have been less successful, however, in dating and identifying the subject of Fielding's other letter to Lady Mary. Fielding begins this letter, dated vaguely "Wednesday Evening," as follows: I have presum'd to send your Ladyship a Copy of the Play which you did me the Honour of reading three Acts of last spring, and hope it may meet as light a Censure from your Ladyship's Judgment as then; for while your Goodness permits me (what I esteem the greatest and indeed only Happiness of my Life) to offer my unworthy Performances to your Perusal, it will be entirely from your Sentence that they will be regarded or disesteem'd by Me. Fielding's biographers and the editor of Lady Mary's correspondence surmise that he is here also referring to The Modern Husband , which was first performed at Drury Lane on 14 February 1731/2, and that he wrote the letter in that same month when sending her a complimentary copy of the work, 3 which was published on 21 February, a Monday. 4 But this conjecture must be mistaken: if Lady Mary read The Modern Husband in its entirety in the copy Fielding sent her on 4 September 1730, then the play he here states she has read only "three Acts of last spring" must be some other work—"last spring" being, from the point of reference of the publication date of The Modern Husband , the spring of 1731. Furthermore, Fielding's phrasing suggests that what he "presum'd" to send her was not merely the published book of a play which had already been staged, but rather a manuscript "Copy" of a play he had recently completed and was now submitting to her for her "Judgment." To which of Fielding's other plays, then, does the letter of "Wednesday Evening" refer? Since it was only partly finished after he had written three Acts, it must have been, like The Modern Husband , one of his regular five-act comedies. Of these, the only other one we know that Lady Mary read, criticized and approved—we know because Fielding tells us so in dedicating the play to her—is Love in Several Masques , the earliest of his plays, produced at Drury Lane on Friday, 16 February 1727/8. Indeed, considering the well-known reluctance of the managers at Drury Lane to risk staging any new play, let alone one by a tyro twenty years old, most students of Fielding plausibly suppose that his début as a playwright was owing in large part to Lady Mary's influence. We may remark, furthermore, that the substance and even the phrasing of the letter agree very well with the particular compliments Fielding pays Lady Mary in his Dedication, which opens as follows: Your Ladyship's known Goodness gives my Presumption the Hopes of a Pardon, for prefixing to this slight Work the Name of a Lady, whose accurate Judgment has long been the Glory or her own Sex, and the Wonder of ours: Especially, since it arose from a Vanity, to which your Indulgence, on the first Perusal of it, gave Birth. I wou'd not insinuate to the World that this Play past free from your Censure; since I know it not free from Faults, not one of which escaped your immediate Penetration. In the letter Fielding similarly apologizes for his presumption and the unworthiness of his work while he praises Lady Mary's "Goodness" and her "Judgment" and expresses relief that, although his play received her "Censure," that censure was "light" enough to encourage him to finish it. This, according to the letter, had been her response when she read the first three Acts of the play in question, just as here, in the Dedication, Fielding attributes his vanity in turning playwright to her "Indulgence, on the first Perusal of" Love in Several Masques . If we assume that Love in Several Masques is the play in question, the "Wednesday Evening" would not be that of 28 February 1727/28; for by the time the comedy was published on Friday, 23 February, Fielding was aware that Lady Mary had not only read and approved the manuscript, but had attended two of the four performances—loyal gestures which he gratefully acknowledged in the Dedication. The letter accompanied the manuscript, not the book of the play. 5 Unfortunately, though we can safely eliminate The Modern Husband as a possibility, we cannot state with perfect certainty that Love in Several Masques is the play in question. It is possible, if less likely, that Fielding was referring to The Temple Beau , the second of his regular comedies to be staged; The Temple Beau was first performed on 26 January 1729/30 at the newly established theatre in Goodman's Fields, presumably after it had been rejected at Drury Lane. In this case, however, "last spring," the spring of 1729, would be a time when Fielding was abroad in Leyden until 30 April (N.S.), after which he may have traveled for a month or two on the Continent before returning home with his fortunes decidedly under a cloud. 6 He was unable to pay his debts and he was still smarting from the less than enthusiastic reception accorded Love in Several Masques . These circumstances might explain the tone of the letter, which, besides being appropriately deferential, is curiously morose—Fielding declaring that Lady Mary's "Goodness" in consenting to criticize his "unworthy Performances" constitutes not only "the greatest," but "indeed only Happiness of my Life." But there is no evidence that Lady Mary read The Temple Beau ; she was very ill in September 1729, as the new theatrical season opened. And Fielding's fortunes were even more uncertain in 1727; without more to go on, it is pointless to speculate on the causes of the vague discontent he expresses in the letter. Two other, still less likely possibilities are Rape upon Rape and The Wedding Day. Rape upon Rape was staged at the Little Haymarket Theatre on 23 June 1730, the culmination of a season in which Fielding had at last tasted success with his irregular plays, The Author's Farce and Tom Thumb . The Wedding Day , which Fielding declared to be "the third Dramatic Performance [he] ever attempted" (the second being the irregular comedy Don Quixote in England , which he sketched out at Leyden in 1728), was not "finished" until the season of 1730-31, 7 when he again had less reason to be as glum and anxious as the tone of the letter suggests. On balance, then, we may tentatively conclude that the "Copy" Fielding sent his clever cousin on that "Wednesday Evening" was a manuscript draft of Love in Several Masques , and the Wednesday in question a day in, say, early September 1727, shortly before the comedy was accepted for performance at Drury Lane. 8 This letter would in any case be the earliest of Fielding's extant correspondence.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Further Additions to the Nichols File of the Gentleman's Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1982 Professor James M. Kuist was able to list and identify the authors of some 13,000 anonymous and pseudonymous pieces in the Gentleman's Magazine (hereafter GM ). 1 Two years later in what I described as a "desultory" study I was able, from various sources, including the GM , to add a not inconsiderable number of identifications of such pieces, some by authors not in the Nichols file. That study appeared in Studies in Bibliography under the title "Additions to the Nichols File of the Gentleman's Magazine " (35 [1982], 228-233). Recently, as the byproduct of research towards a biography of Richard Farmer, author of An Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare (1767), I have gleaned a few more identifications from a number of sources, including John Nichols's Literary Anecdotes , a work which continues to reward the researcher. George Dyer, friend of Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, wrote or compiled, among other works, The Privileges of the University of Cambridge (a shortened title), 2 volumes, 1824. He appended an unpaged Postscript to volume 2 in which he included a "List of Publications and Writings. By G. Dyer." Among his writings were a number of reviews. Both the old and new Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature list the Analytical Review , the Critical Review , the Reflector , and the Monthly Magazine , all of which are in Dyer's own list, but neither bibliography lists the others for which Dyer wrote reviews or other pieces and which he also names, i.e. Athenaeum, Asiatic Register, Classical Journal, Genteman's Magazine , and the Ladies' Magazine and Ladies' Museum (O3 v -O4 r ). My concern is with the reviews in the GM , which Dyer lists as follows: An Account, from a Survey, of a State of the Prisons in London, for a History of the Metropolis; in 4to.: edited by Sir Richard Phillips.—Critiques on Mr. Northmore's Edition of Tryphiodorus (as I think , finding the remarks on them among my papers) —on Mr. Meen's Specimen of a Translation of Lycophron—on Mr. Charles Lamb's Works—and on Admiral Burney's History of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea, &amp;c.; in 5 Vols. 4to.: all in the Gentleman's Magazine. John Nichols marked two contributions by Dyer to the GM ; none of the above is identified (Kuist, p. 57). I have been unable to find any mention of the first work Dyer reviewed, that edited by Sir Richard Phillips, publisher of the Monthly Magazine or British Register , a periodical to which Dyer contributed from its very inception. 2 The review of Northmore's edition of Tryphodorus (1793, ii. 1200-01) and of Meen's Specimen of a translation of Lycophron (1801. i. 57-58) are of interest solely as they demonstrate Dyer's erudition. The review of Admiral (then Captain) James Burney's History (1816. ii. 50-53, 242-246) is of greater interest because the reviewer of Burney's Chronological History of North Eastern Voyages of Discovery in the 1819 GM (ii. 436-437) states that in volume 86 (1816) of the GM "we gave an account of Capt. Burney's Voyages in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean," which may mean that Dyer reviewed the later work also. Of major interest and what seems to have gone unnoted is that Dyer reviewed the 1818 edition of the Works of his friend, Charles Lamb. The review was the longest Dyer wrote in the GM , appearing in the July (pp. 48-51) and August (pp. 138-140) numbers of the 1819 volume, part 2, and covering over eight closely printed columns. As the GM is not a rare periodical, I shall quote only the concluding sentence of this two-part review: "We shall therefore only add, that, as we have read Mr. Lamb's Works with considerable pleasure ourselves, so we think them calculated, considered either morally or critically, to give pleasure and instruction to other readers." The eccentric George Dyer's reviews in the GM deserve identification. One other review, possibly by Dyer although not published in the GM , should be mentioned. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects (1796) was reviewed, among other places, in the Critical Review , 2nd Series, XVII, 209-212. The review was anonymous, the contents described as "Poems have great beauty, but deficient in polish and metre." 3 Lamb wrote to Coleridge on July 5-7, 1796 about the review in the Critical Review and said, "I suspect Master Dyer to have been the writer of that article, as the Substance of it was the very remarks &amp; language he used to me one day." 4 Dyer did not name this review in his list of writings in the Critical Review , although it might be one of the "various Theological and Critical Tracts" which he did not otherwise identify. Students of nineteenth-century English literature will have encountered the name of George Dyer. Few indeed would recognize the name of Thomas Harwood. But he, too, contributed, albeit pseudonymously, to the GM , to an extent I have not thought fit to explore, as his contributions could be scattered over some thirty-five volumes of the periodical, from about 1790 to 1807. He is credited with one piece in the GM in 1820 (Kuist, p. 76) under his initials. In the 1812 edition of the Biographia Dramatica , published five years after Isaac Reed's death in 1807 but which he had been revising for many years, Reed included a brief biographical sketch of Harwood because Harwood had written two tragedies. What is of immediate interest are these two sentences: "He was author of several letters in the Gentleman's Magazine , with the signature of Clio . He also penned Observations on the Writings of Dr. Johnson ; but we know not whether these were ever published" (I. 313). Future researchers in the GM may profit from the knowledge that Harwood was "Clio." And, as a by-product, Johnsonians will know the author of the Observations should they ever surface. Harwood, incidentally, was the author of Alumni Etonienses (1797) and editor of Erdeswick's Staffordshire (1819), among other works. 5 Robert Wylie King, author of The Translator of Dante; The Life, Work and Friendships of Henry Francis Cary (1772-1844) , published in London in 1925, suggests in a footnote that "we may also assume that verses signed T.L. or T.L.---d (Lycid) are [Thomas] Lister's and that those signed T.T.R. or T.T.S. (Tityrus) are [John] Humberston's" (p. 29n.). Lister and Humberston were at Sutton Coldfield Grammar School with Cary, the trio adopting the names given above, with Cary as Marcellus (p. 19). King may have erred in his note on page 29 in thinking it probable that Cary used the initials M.C.S. for Marcellus as well as M---s for pieces in the GM . M.C.S. were the initials used by the Reverend W. Bagshaw Stevens (Kuist, p. 146). A problem arises, however, in that there are five sonnets in the 1790 GM , all with the information that they were written in 1788 and bearing the initials M.C.S. Three are at i. 452 and two at ii. 748, with one sonnet, that To a Lady at a Concert , appearing in both places. They are all in the stilted style of much amatory verse. If they are Bagshaw Stevens's, two of whose contributions to the GM were sonnets, then Nichols failed to mark them as his. If King is correct about the contributions of Lister and Humberston, and there is indication that he is from the subjects of those contributions, we may add to Lister's two identified pieces (Kuist, p. 86) and enlist Humberston as a hitherto unidentified contributor. I have gone through the GM for the years 1788 through 1793 and can list the following, all previously unnoted: 1788. i. 61-62, Horace Ode XXVI, Lib. i. (T.L. of Lichfield); 159, On Solitude (T.T.R., with first line, "While Cary strikes the glowing lyre"); 252, The Fourth Idyllium of Bion (T.L.); 446, Stanzas to an Infant (T.L---D.), Sonnet to Miss Seward (T.L.), Elegiac Sonnet (T.L---D.), Address to the Owl (T.T.S.). 1788. ii. 1105, A Pastoral Song (T.L.---D.). 1789. i. 161-162, Elegiac Sonnet (T.L---D.); 554, Sonnet to Fancy (T.T.S.). 1789. ii. 650, Sonnet to Time (T.T.S.); 841, Sonnet to H.F. Cary, By T. Lister, Feb. 1788 (unsigned, of course). 1791. ii. 1044, Sonnet to a Lady Written in an Alcove in Kensington Gardens (T.T.S.). 1793. i. 261, Sent to a Lady, Inclosing the Ring for her Marriage (T.L.). There were no pieces by Lister or Humberston in the 1794 GM . King states that "Early in 1791 [Cary] contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine two short translations from the letters of Bernardo Tasso," identified in a footnote, " Gent. Mag. , 1791, Feb. p. 125; April, p. 309. The second is unsigned, but there can be no doubt of its ascription to Cary" (p. 55 and n.). The first is noted in Kuist; the second is not. King cites Cary's " Memoir , i, p. 316" as evidence that Cary reviewed his own work, i.e. three of his sermons that had appeared in Edward Pye Waters's Sermons on Various Occasions , in the GM for Sept. 1800, pp. 867-869. In the Memoir Cary, writing to the Reverend Thomas Price on Nov. 11, 1814, asked that Price be prompt in acquainting him "with the publication of your sermons. I do not recollect to have offered my services to the 'Gentleman's Magazine,' since the appearance of Waters's volume. But I shall be happy to assist at your debut as an author" (i. 316). Accordingly, Cary reviewed Price's sermons in the GM (1815. ii. 147-148). Hence, two more pieces by Cary are to be added to Kuist (p. 48). Incidentally, there is a poem by Waters on Cary in the GM (1788. i. 347-348). John Nichols, basing himself on manuscripts of William Cole, wrote in his account of the Reverend Mr. Michael Tyson that "In the Gent. Mag. for 1777 [p. 416] he has a Letter relating to a Sculpture found in the Parish Church of Fakenham in Suffolk, signed T.M. the reversed Initials of his names: and I think he afterwards gave a draught of it, with some further explanation" ( Literary Anecdotes , VIII. 206). The draught is actually en face and there is no further explanation. Add Tyson's one contribution to the File. In another work, his Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica , Nichols stated that a piece in the 1772 GM (p. 42) signed W.L. of Leicester was by William Ludlam, a name not in Kuist. Ludlam helped Nichols in the latter's History of Leicestershire. Ludlam contributed at least one piece to the GM over his name (vol. 35, pp. 412-413). Back to the Literary Anecdotes , where Michael Tyson, writing to Richard Gough, asks "What say you to Rowley now? Who is the Author of the last squib in the Gent. Mag.?" (VIII. 627), a question which Nichols answers in a footnote, "Answer: The Rev. John Duncombe; see vol. XLVII., p. 317." Duncombe wrote much in the GM (Kuist, p. 57), but the squib on Rowley is not listed in the Nichols File, although it bears his pseudonym, Crito, used for the first time it would seem. Tyson to Gough again, in another letter: "Did you receive my memorandums on Coffee, and are they worthy the acceptance of Mr. Urban?" Nichols again supplies an answer: "See Gent. Mag. 1779, vol. XLIX, p. 237," the piece in question being signed "T.L." One more, then, for Tyson. On February 2, 1780 Tyson wrote to Gough discoursing of many things, among others some biographical conjectures about Matthew Prior. "How George [Ashby] does sputter about Mat Prior," Tyson wrote; "I have some where heard that his Chloe was a Butcher's wife of Cambridge; and that Prior left her some houses he had purchased, either in Jesus or Emanuel lane. If you give a hint to [John] Nichols of this, perhaps George would fish it out." Footnotes identify George Ashby and refer to the GM , volume 50, pp. 28 and 126 ( Literary Anecdotes , VIII. 661). On page 28 of the 1780 GM "D.C." animadverts on Prior's Solomon and takes occasion to call attention to Prior's will in which he makes "Mr. Adrian Drift, and Mrs. Elizabeth Cox [i.e. Chloe], his residuary legatees." On page 126 "M. Green," one of John Nichols's pseudonyms, sends " two letters, of Bishop Atterbury and Mr. Prior." D.C. is, then, George Ashby. William Cole is represented in Kuist with but one entry, signed "W.C.," in the 1781 GM . John Nichols, however, wrote of him that "In compliance with a public request, he communicated to Mr. Urban an account of St. Nicholas; and gave, in the same volume of the Gentleman's Magazine , some Remarks on Sir John Hawkin's 'History of Music'" ( Literary Anecdotes , I. 661). A footnote refers one to the GM for XLIX, pp. 119, 131, 157, 208, and 219, the volume number being in error, as it should be volume XLVII (1777). Nichols's account is also garbled. Palaeophilus gave a learned account of the probable origin of the name Saint Nicholas (p. 119-120). On page 131, part of a review of Observations in a Journey to Paris by Way of Flanders . . ., the author was quoted to the effect that "any curious antiquary" who could identify the figure of a saint "with two naked children at his feet, in a bathing-tub" would please insert his answer in the GM . Accordingly, "W.C. of Milton, near Cambridge" explained that the saint was St. Nicholas (pp. 157-158). Page 208 contains a short addition to the matter of St. Nicholas, this by X.X. And the remarks on Hawkins's "History of Music" are signed "W. Cole, Milton, near Cambridge," adding the W.C. piece on pages 157-158 to the Nichols file and clearing up an erroneous and ambiguous passage in the Literary Anecdotes . An anonymous "Memoir of Dr. John Green, Bishop of London" in the May 1779 GM (pp. 234-236) is attributed to "W. Cole" in ink in the margin of the Cambridge University Library copy of that volume of the GM . Cole knew Green and heartly disliked him, 6 which would seem to militate against the attribution, as the Bishop is praised in the piece. A letter signed J. Carr in John Coakley Lettsom's Hints Designed to Promote Beneficence, Temper and Medical Science , 3 vols. (1801), II. 175 had appeared in the 1786 GM (ii. 725-726) signed simply "J.C." Carr does not appear in Kuist. This may be John Carr (1723-1807), architect, known as Carr of York, as he built the courthouse, castle, and gaol at York, the last of which buildings forms a possible link with the prison reformer John Howard, the subject of Carr's letter. The same authority (p. 179) names the Reverend Weedon Butler as the "Spontaneous" who, with other members of the Society for the Relief and Discharge of Persons imprisoned for Small Debts, contributed towards a statue for Howard ( GM , 1786. ii. 723). Butler contributed pieces to the GM (Kuist, pp. 40-41), but not, evidently, as "Spontaneous." William Walker, in his Life of the Reverend George Gleig , Edinburgh, 1878, p. 192, states that the letter signed "An Episcopal Clergyman of the Scotch Church" in the June 1785 GM (i. 437-440) is by Gleig. Gleig is represented by one contribution to the GM in Kuist (p. 64). Sir John Cullum's History and Antiquities of Hamstead and Hardwick in the County of Suffolk , first published in 1784, was edited again in 1813 by his brother Sir Thomas-Gery Cullum. Sir Thomas attributed a piece on cedar trees in the GM for March 1779 (p. 138) to his brother and queried whether he had also written the piece on yew trees in the same periodical (p. 578) in the same year. He also gave the GM for Dec. 1792 (pp. 995-997) as a locus for his brother's familiar epistolary style. The piece on the cedar trees is signed with Sir John's name: that on the yew trees (accepted as Sir John's in the DNB account of him) is signed "A.B."; the two letters in the 1792 GM are signed "J.C." John Nichols corroborates the authorship of the two letters in his Literary Anecdotes , VIII. 676 and n. The piece on the yew trees is almost surely not by Sir John, but one can now add two pieces signed J.C. to the Nichols File. Cambridge University Library Adv. c. 89.11 is, as the manuscript title-page has it, a "Memoir of W m Capon, Esqr By Mr Samuel Tymms. With a List of various Drawings by Mr Capon in the possession of JB Nichols." The "Memoir" consists of pasted-in pages from the GM . One is the obituary notice of Capon (Oct. 1827, pp. 374-377); the other is "Anecdotes of Mr. Capon" (Feb. 1828, pp. 105-107). Both are signed in the GM with what looks like an elaborate capital letter (D or T?); both bear the appended manuscript signature "Samuel Tymms." The 1827 and 1828 GM are cited in the DNB account of Capon. Tymms (1808-1871), described in the DNB as an antiquary, was on the staff of the GM early in life.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Richard Baldwin Junior, Bookseller by C. Y. Ferdinand</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early in the nineteenth century, John Nichols could readily claim that "the name of Baldwin has long been, and still continues to be, famous in the Annals of Bibliography." 1 The name itself might then have been famous, but many details of the lives and careers of the individual booksellers, printers, and bookbinders of that name have continued to elude bibliographers. Baldwins were active in the London booktrade from the latter seventeenth century when one Richard Baldwin (1653?-1698), the political publisher, was active, through the eighteenth century with the careers of his widow Abigail Baldwin (1658-1713), Richard Baldwin senior (1694?-1777), his sons Robert (1717-1748) and Richard junior (1724-1770), and their cousins Henry (1734-1813) and Robert Baldwin (1737-1810) (see Genealogical Appendix). A family preference for the names Richard and Robert, usually abbreviated to "R." in their imprints, complicates the problem in the eighteenth century. So Plomer conflates Richard Baldwin senior, Richard Baldwin junior, and Robert Baldwin into one entry—under Robert; and Nichols, contemporary and friend of the late eighteenth- early nineteenth-century generation of the family, was unaware of the brief mid-eighteenth-century career of Richard Baldwin junior's elder brother Robert, and he slightly muddles the death dates of Baldwins with whom he was probably acquainted. 2 More recently, scholars have had to resort to conjecture in their attempts to decide which R. Baldwin was associated with the book in hand. 3 The effect has been that the Baldwin family has received collective credit for its part in the publication of editions of Horace, Shakespeare, Milton, and Pope, Smollett's most important works, numerous botanical and medical tracts by Sir John Hill, Memoires of Bolingbroke , Hoyle, and other works. Richard Baldwin junior, whose enterprise and energy were in fact behind most of these publications, has been all but lost in the shuffle of R. Baldwins. 4 The main concern of this paper, then, is to establish the bibliographical and biographical details of his career. A powerful new research tool, The Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue ( ESTC ), offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling such complicated bibliographical problems. Its data base contains about 217,000 bibliographical entries (800,000 locations) all of them indexed and subject to computer searches of varying complexity. 5 A straightforward search for Baldwin imprints in Richard Baldwin junior's lifetime (from the 1720s through the 1760s) produces a list of about 750 imprints. 6 An examination of the books themselves, coupled with the results of traditional archival research, provides an outline for a biobibliography of Richard Baldwin junior. And because his career overlaps and joins those of other R. Baldwins, all of them family members, details of related lives fall into place. 7 It is the further purpose of this essay, by establishing more accurately the details of the career of Richard Baldwin junior, to increase our understanding of his publishing activities and those of his associates in the eighteenth century. Richard Baldwin junior was born in the heart of the London booktrade district probably 27 November 1724; 8 the second son of Richard and Hannah Baldwin, he was christened 13 December in the parish church of St. Martin Ludgate. 9 His father, Richard Baldwin senior, had already served a number of years in the trade, first as apprentice to bookbinder Robert Whitledge. He became free of the Stationers' Company in 1716 10 and may have continued with Whitledge in Creed Lane as journeyman bookbinder. Stationers' Company registers record Baldwin's first apprentice, John Whiffen, in February 1726 and a second, Robert Stephen, in April of the same year. 11 By this time he was paying taxes on a modest property in St. Martin Ludgate. 12 In 1732, more than sixteen years after his freedom, he accepted a call to the Livery; his name first appeared in that year as bookseller, possibly copyholder, in several imprints; 13 he moved to the Blue Bible in St. Paul's Churchyard; 14 and he took on his eldest son Robert as one of his apprentices. 15 In spite of all this activity from bookbinder to bookseller, there is little evidence in the following years of Richard Baldwin senior having a flourishing bookselling business. 16 In 1740 when Richard junior was fifteen years old, he was sent out of London to Salisbury to serve his apprenticeship with Benjamin Collins (1715-1785). 17 The Collins-Baldwin connection must have been based in Berkshire: Benjamin Collins was born in Faringdon, where Robert Baldwin, an apothecary and Richard senior's brother, still lived with his family. A number of Richard junior's cousins, including Robert (1737-1810) and Henry (1734-1813), important figures in the late eighteenth-century booktrade, were also born in Faringdon. 18 William Collins (1705-1740?), 19 Benjamin's eldest brother, was a Salisbury bookseller and printer whose name is found in earlier partnerships with Richard Baldwin senior and with Thomas Astley, who was another Berkshire transplant to London. 20 Astley is also the first London distributor to be listed in the colophon of the Salisbury Journal . So the Berkshire-Wiltshire-London links were already well established when Richard junior began his apprenticeship in September 1740. The two Collins brothers had been in Salisbury since about 1729 when they are believed to have had a hand in the establishment of the first short-lived Salisbury Journal . 21 The only evidence of their partnership is in the intertwined woodcut initials "BC" and "WC" in the headpieces of early numbers of the newspaper. In fact, Benjamin probably played a subordinate role to his brother at this time and may have been William's apprentice, although no formal record of apprenticeship survives. Few Collins imprints are extant from the period between 1729 and 1740. 22 It is likely therefore that the business was grounded in jobbing printing, bookbinding, and the sale of London imprints, stationery, and medical supplies to an expanding provincial market, at least until late 1736. In that year the Salisbury Journal was reestablished, and this time the newspaper was a successful addition to the Collins repertoire, providing a steady source of revenue in sales and advertisements, as well as creating opportunities for enlarging London and provincial contacts. The printing office Richard Baldwin junior joined as an apprentice in 1740 was therefore one in which a large range of professional expertise was available; and he would have brought to it his own experience in his father's shop. By this time management of the Salisbury business was solely in the capable hands of Benjamin Collins. 23 There is evidence that Collins and his first apprentice shared a sound, intuitive sense of good business, for Collins entrusts the running of an Isle of Wight agency to the young man in 1743 when Richard is eighteen years old: "R. Baldwin, Bookseller in the Isle of Wight " replaces Thomas Geare 24 in the colophon of the Salisbury Journal for 28 June 1743. Richard Baldwin's name also appears frequently with that of Benjamin Collins and Thomas Burrough of Devizes in book, stationery, and medical advertisements in the newspaper. 25 Reports from Newport, perhaps from the pen of Richard junior, regularly appear in the paper's local news section during this time—usually they are standardized accounts of the assizes, loyal celebrations, and unusual crimes. An indication of his youthful enterprise is found in a Journal advertisement 24 September 1745 in which Richard Baldwin is selling Sterrop's True Spectacles, and "all Manner of Musical Instruments, as Violins, German, and common Flutes, &amp;c. Also, the most curious painted Paper for Rooms." While Richard Baldwin the younger was maintaining an Isle of Wight agency and completing his apprenticeship, his brother Robert was setting up shop in the parish of St. Martin Ludgate, London, at the Bible and Crown near Stationers' Hall. He had obtained his freedom 7 August 1739 but was not clothed until 12 April 1743 (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 17, 426). He is recorded in the Faringdon Within tax books from 1743 in premises previously occupied by Elizabeth Jefferies near Stationers' Hall. 26 A number of imprints in the 1740s include his name, often with J. Jefferies or in some version of "R. Baldwin &amp; Comp. over-against Stationers-Hall." 27 Evidence of the extent and nature of Robert Baldwin's relationship with John Jefferies is provided in a Salisbury Journal advertisement of 27 July 1747: The Partnership between Robert Baldwin, and John Jefferies, Booksellers, and Pasteboard-Ware-house-Keepers, at the Bible and Crown, fronting Stationers-Hall, near Ludgate Street, London: Being by Agreement dissolv'd . THIS is to acquaint the Customers and Others , that the said Business is now carried on by Robert Baldwin, ONLY , at the same Shop, . . . By whom Gentlemen, School-Masters, Booksellers , and Chapmen , may be supply'd with all Sorts of Bibles, Common-Prayers, Books of Divinity, School-Books, &amp;c. at the very lowest Rates, Wholesale or Retail; and continues selling the best Mill'd-Boards for the use of Bookbinders, &amp;c. at fourteen Shillings per Hundred Weight , and Orders for the same to any part of Great-Britain , . . . Robert died when he was only thirty. His will was proved 13 February 1747/48, less than a month after it was written. He left instructions for his widow Elizabeth (pregnant with their daughter Elizabeth at the time of his death) to continue his trade if she wished; Richard Baldwin senior and Samuel Birt, another bookseller and a family friend, were instructed to assist her "as much as lyes in their Power," although the two were absolved of any responsibility for trade losses incurred by the widow since the book business is "in its Nature hazardous" (PRO, PROB 11/759/37). Only one book has been discovered bearing the imprint of E. Baldwin, and "Widow Baldwin" disappears from the tax assessors' books, apparently replaced by Paul Stephens in 1751. 28 Robert Baldwin's short career has been unnoticed until now. During this time Richard Baldwin senior appears in imprints only occasionally. ESTC records "R. Baldwin in St. Paul's-church-yard" in only five entries. He and his son Robert were both subscribers to Daniel Bellamy's Truth of Christian Religion (1744). He was still in St. Paul's Churchyard (but not as a landlord, that is, taxpayer) 16 January 1747/48 when Robert Baldwin writes his will. Richard senior may have had other business activities, for it is clear that bookselling cannot have been his primary source of income. In 1746, near the end of his time on the Isle of Wight, Richard Baldwin junior's name first appears in the imprints of two sermons. In both cases the partners are J. and J. Rivington in London and Benjamin Collins in Salisbury. The first is Magistrates and Their Office Considered , preached by William Budworth in 1739 and advertised in the Salisbury Journal of 18 August 1746 as shortly to be published. The second, John Gilbert's topical The Duty of Fearing God and the King , is advertised 10 November. Richard Baldwin junior apparently had left the Isle of Wight by the time a pamphlet sermon of similar content and format, Thomas Whitewood's Love to God the Best Tribute of Praise , is first advertised two weeks later and this work bears the imprint of Jonathan Moore, bookseller in Newport. The Isle of Wight changes are also noted in the colophon of the Journal 24 November 1746, and Baldwin is replaced by Moore in advertisements over the next few weeks. On 15 December 1746 Richard Baldwin places a notice in the Salisbury Journal : ALL Persons indebted to Richard Baldwin , late of Newport Bookseller, are desired forthwith, to pay their respective Debts to Mr. Jonathan Moore of Newport, (who succeeds him in his Shop and Business in Newport aforesaid,) and his Receipt shall be a full Discharge, From your humble Servant Richard Baldwin, N.B. The said J. Moore , continues the Bookselling and Stationary Business, in the same Shop as R. Baldwin kept, and will supply all Gentlemen and Others, with Books, and Stationary-Wares, on the best Terms, either Wholesale or Retail. At this distance it is impossible to say whether Richard Baldwin's removal to London was an abrupt one to take advantage of a sudden opportunity, or whether it was a long-planned phase of his career. Certainly there was opportunity in London. The imprint of the London Magazine for November 1746, published early December, indicates that it is "printed for T. Astley, and Sold by R. Baldwin, at the Rose in Pater-Noster-Row ." 29 Probably to avoid confusion between father and son, the imprint for the December number and for the general titlepage for 1746 (which would have been printed after all the monthly parts) is amended to "R. Baldwin, jun." The London Magazine was an important publication, established in 1732 by the proprietors of the Monthly Chronicle (itself begun four years earlier) to compete with the Gentleman's Magazine . The London Magazine was the Gentleman's most successful rival and the chance of obtaining an interest in the enterprise must have been attractive. Richard Baldwin junior clearly had ability and relevant experience; what is less clear is how he financed the arrangement—perhaps with the assistance of his father or of Astley himself. 30 Soon after—on 3 February 1747—Richard junior obtained his freedom by patrimony (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 17). Thomas Astley's name is dropped from the London Magazine 's imprint with the April 1747 issue, coinciding with his arrest for publishing Lord Lovat's trial in that periodical; and when the 1747 land tax is collected on the Rose in Paternoster Row the owner is recorded as Richard Baldwin. Astley's arrest and fines did not deter him from moving to the shop next to John Walthoe on Cornhill—formerly in the possession of Francis Ellis and Company, but noted the previous year as empty—which had over four times the rateable value of his old premises in the Row. Unfortunately, this property, along with many others, was destroyed in the devastating fire of 25 March 1748. 31 Richard Baldwin junior's status was rising steadily and so was the number of Baldwin imprints, slowly at first, then accelerating sharply in the early 1750s. During his first complete year in London he and his brother are on three titlepages each, Richard as "R. Baldwin jun." in every case. In 1748, the year of Robert's death, Robert has only one book and Richard six. 32 There are eleven imprints in 1749 with "jun." and two more can be added on the basis of the address. Sixteen were published the following year, seven with the epithet, nine without. The Gentleman's and Tradesman's Daily Journal is registered to "Rich d Baldwin in Pater Noster Row" in the Stationers' Register 29 November 1749. In this one instance Richard signs the entry and he includes "Jun r ," providing evidence that he was known by both forms of name in his early London years—also that he was investing in copies. A Description of the First Discoveries of the Ancient City of Heraclea registered 22 August 1750 to "Rich d Baldwin" and bearing the imprint of Richard Baldwin, jun. is corroborative. But fewer and fewer of the increasing number of imprints (up to forty-seven in 1753) describe the retailer or copyholder as "junior"; the last to do so appeared in 1754. During these years he became established as Richard Baldwin at the Rose in Paternoster Row. It is possible, too, that the other Richard Baldwin, his father, left off business about this time to retire to Birmingham. 33 One other R. Baldwin may have come to London around 1752. In that year Richard Baldwin junior's Berkshire cousin Robert would have been fourteen years old. No official record of his apprenticeship has been discovered, but Robert Baldwin owns the whole copyright of the London Magazine by July 1769 when he enters the number for that month in the Stationers' Company registers, 34 and it is he who takes over the business when Richard dies in 1770. While it is likely that Robert learned the art of bookselling from his cousin, joining Richard's first apprentice, John Staples of Salisbury, 35 there are no grounds for believing that Robert was more than a journeyman or subordinate partner until at least the mid-1760s. Henry Baldwin, another cousin and Robert's brother, presents no real problem. 36 He was printer to a number of projects in which Richard Baldwin had an interest, including the London Magazine (after Henry took over the deceased Charles Ackers's business) and the London Packet , and he is justly famous for his St. James's Chronicle . 37 Most of the editions recorded in the ESTC Baldwin search for 1747 through 1769 can now be assigned to Richard Baldwin junior in Paster-noster Row, as retailer (that is, the book was sold by him), sole copyholder, or partner (the book was printed for him alone or in partnership) on the basis of the imprints—on the form of name, the address, and the relationship with other names. 38 The London Magazine was his most important early venture, involving, if not initially, then by the early 1750s, a financial investment in a share of the copyright. His other concerns could not always be described as great literature and are often unfamiliar to the twentieth-century reader, but many must have been good, even best, sellers. The variety of titles is striking. Copies which Baldwin bought at the beginning of his career include, among others, an account of the life of the defiant forger John Wells (two editions in 1749), The Muncher's and Guzler's Diary (1749), An Inquiry into the Medicinal Virtues of Bristol-Water (1750), a translation of Gabriel Dellon's Relation de l'inquisition de Goa (1750), and The Gentleman's and Tradesman's Daily Journal for the Year 1750 —all of them are printed for R. Baldwin, jun. Probably none of them were expensive, either in outlay for copy or in production costs. Yet they seem to have been sound investments generally, setting a pattern of buying copies and shares of copies, then investing the profits from those copies into more (and more reliable, more profitable) copies. Imprints of 1750 indicate that seven books were printed for Richard Baldwin junior himself, and he is the retailer noted in six other books (all six printed for Thomas Astley). Ten years later Baldwin is part or sole owner of copies of thirty-three books published in 1760; only five others are sold by him, and he may have owned shares of some of those. 39 One measure of his success in the 1750s is his election to the office of Renter Warden of the Stationers' Company in 1753 (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 405). Of perhaps greater importance is his acceptance into the London booktrade's established congers. 40 It was by this means that he obtained shares in major publications of his time. So a sub-pattern in his career is a gradual move to less risky, more substantial undertakings within the framework of large partnerships. By the time of his death 15 March 1770, Richard Baldwin junior had built up a solid family business on a foundation of sound investment in copies. When his cousin Robert succeeded to the shop at number 47 (formerly the Rose 41 ) Paternoster Row, he saw no need to alter the imprints to reflect the transition. Works continued to be printed for R. Baldwin until well past the turn of the nineteenth century. 42</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (1812-1815), 3:716. 2 H. R. Plomer, A Dictionary of the Printers and Booksellers Who Were at Work in England Scotland and Ireland from 1726 to 1775 (1932), 14; Nichols, Literary Anecdotes , 3: 716-17. 3 For example, D. F. Foxon thinks that the Baldwin in William Diaper's Brent a Poem (Sarum: Printed for William Collins, and sold by T. Astley and R. Baldwin [1732?]) is "probably Richard senior." He is right; in fact Foxon is right in each of his Baldwin attributions as his work is based on careful examination of the imprints. But additional evidence dispels the need for conjecture (D. F. Foxon, English Verse 1701-1751: A Catalogue of Separately Printed Poems with Notes on Contemporary Collected Editions [1975], 2:153; Diaper's poem is Foxon D291). J. P. Feather lists Richard junior and his cousin Robert together under Richard Baldwin in his indexes to booksellers' prospectuses (J. P. Feather, comp., Book Prospectuses before 1801 in the John Johnson Collection [1976] and Book Prospectuses before 1801 in the Gough Collection [1980]). 4 His part in the London Magazine has been acknowledged though (D. F. McKenzie and J. C. Ross, A Ledger of Charles Ackers, Printer of The London Magazine [1968], 10-11). 5 216,980 entries, with over 1,000 libraries contributing as of May 1988. M. J. Crump of the ESTC /BL has provided invaluable assistance. 6 Searches of the database for imprints 1720-1759 were conducted in January 1987, for the 1760s in February 1987. It should be noted that ESTC does not include addresses in the publishers subfield (except when the address is the only means of establishing the place of publication), and congers of more than seven proprietors usually include only the names of the first five; some Baldwin imprints may therefore be lost, particularly in early years when Richard did not have seniority in the Stationers' Company. 7 Roderick Cave thinks that the Baldwins printing in Jamaica in the 1720s and 1730s are related. I agree, but have been unsuccessful in finding them a place on the London/Berkshire family tree. (See Cave's "The First Printers in Jamaica," Amphora no. 27 [1977].) My search has not been expanded to include the lives of the seventeenth-century Richard Baldwin and his wife Abigail, or details of the lives of the cousins Henry and Robert Baldwin. (For authoritative discussion of the Baldwins as trade publishers see Michael Treadwell, "London Trade Publishers 1675-1750," The Library , 6th ser., 4 [1982]: 99-134; see also Leona Rostenberg, "Richard and Anne [ sic ] Baldwin, Whig Patriot Publishers," Publications of the Bibliographical Society of America 47 [1953]: 1-42; Stanley Morison describes Richard Baldwin's newspaper enterprises in The English Newspaper: Some Account of the Physical Development of Journals Printed in London between 1622 &amp; the Present Day [1932], 57-64. For Henry Baldwin, see below, n. 37.) 8 In a holograph draft of his will, dated 28 July 1769, Richard Baldwin junior specifies that the interest from £150 be used "to Purchase five Great Coats, for five Poor Liverymen of the said [Stationers'] Company, every Year, who shall be actually above the Age of Sixty, and be given them on the 27 th of November Old Stile, which is now the 8 th of Dec r . . . ." The date obviously had significance for Baldwin and the proximity to the anniversary of his christening suggests a birth day—unless of course he was commemorating St. Budoc's day? (Public Record Office [PRO], PROB 31/558/245, Exhibit A). 9 (Guildhall Library, London, MS 10,214). Dates of birth as well as christening are noted for most infants in the registers for St. Martin Ludgate at this time, but this additional information is lacking for the Richard Baldwin entry. An interval of about two weeks between birth and baptism—at least for healthy babies—was common. 10 Richard Baldwin senior's term of apprenticeship was from 2 August 1708 to 7 May 1716. He was not admitted to the Livery until 5 September 1732 (D. F. McKenzie, ed., Stationers' Company Apprentices 1701-1800 [1978], 374, 425). 11 (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 17). Whiffen was turned over to Baldwin by William Green, bookbinder of Scalding Alley. Baldwin's address was still Creed Lane. 12 The first record of Richard Baldwin in this location is early 1725 when land tax for 1724 was collected. In this instance he paid 16 s. as landlord, but nothing on personal property (Guildhall Library, MS 11,316/76). 13 The third and fourth editions of The Posthumous Works of Mr Samuel Butler (London: Printed for and sold by Richard Baldwin) and Diaper's Brent a Poem . The latter is only tentatively dated 1732. 14 While Richard Baldwin was listed as a taxpayer in St. Martin Ludgate from 1725 to 1731 he does not appear in the tax books in St. Paul's Churchyard (that is, in the parish of St. Faith under St. Paul's). This suggests a tenancy or a partnership. 15 Robert Baldwin was born 18 October and christened 3 November 1717 in the parish of St. Martin Ludgate (Guildhall Library, MS 10,213). He served his apprenticeship from 1 August 1732 to 7 August 1739 (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 17). 16 Only six imprints that can be assigned to Richard Baldwin senior from 1732 to 1744 were listed in the ESTC database. 17 Richard Baldwin junior was Collins's apprentice from 16 September 1740; a premium of £25 was paid (PRO, IR I/50/133. See Christabel Dale, Wiltshire Apprentices and Their Masters 1710-1760 [1961], no. 93, and Ian Maxted, The British Book Trades, 1710-1777 [1983], no. 0365). 18 Benjamin Collins was christened 14 October 1715; Robert Baldwin 29 June 1737; and Henry Baldwin 27 December 1734 (Faringdon Parish Registers, Berkshire Record Office [BRO], D/P53/1/2). 19 William was christened 1 September 1705. William and Margaret Collins had earlier had another son William baptized 9 February 1701/02, who apparently died at five months. The burial of this William Collins is recorded 22 July 1702 (Faringdon Parish Registers, BRO, D/P53/1/1). 20 Besides Diaper's poem in 1732, Collins is listed with Astley—as well as E. Easton and J. Knapton—in the imprint of A Dissertation in Vindication of the Antiquity of Stone Henge (1730), a pseudonymous work by Stamford Wallis; and, with Astley and five others, in the first two editions of Samuel Fancourt, The Nature and Expediency of the Gospel Revelation (1734). 21 Mrs. Herbert Richardson, "Wiltshire Newspapers—Past and Present. Part III. (Continued.) The Newspapers of South Wilts," Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine 41 (1919): 53-56. 22 I have discovered only eleven William Collins imprints, most of them pamphlets. 23 William Collins apparently died between 5 August 1740 when his name last appears in the Salisbury Journal colophon and the following week when Benjamin's name appears. Benjamin Collins has no published comment on his brother's disappearance. 24 Thomas Geare is found in Yeovil selling Squire's Genuine Grand Elixir in 1737 (Advertisement Salisbury Journal 19 December 1737). He makes his first appearance in the colophon as "Mr. Tho. Gear, Bookseller, and Distributor of this Paper in the Isle of Wight " 8 April 1740. 25 It is unlikely that the R. Baldwin at Newport in the Isle of Wight and so closely connected with Benjamin Collins was Richard Baldwin senior, who would have been about fifty years old in 1743. He was apparently still in business at this time, but almost certainly only in London. Richard Baldwin junior frequently omitted "junior" from his name, often signing "R Baldwin" with the initials distinctively intertwined. In addition, the start of Richard junior's London career coincides exactly with R. Baldwin's departure from the Isle of Wight. 26 (Guildhall Library, MS 11,316/130 and 133). Robert's wife was called Elizabeth and it is tempting to speculate that she is the same Elizabeth Jefferies—possibly the daughter of the bookseller Francis Jefferies (d. 1738/39)—near Stationers' Hall. Their first child, Samuel, was born 24 July 1743 and buried 15 August 1743; Francis Jefferies Baldwin was born 26 June 1744 and died January 1745/46. Two other children are recorded in the parish registers, Avis (b. 4 May 1746) and Elizabeth, who was born 20 March 1747/48, a little over a month after her father's death (Guildhall Library, MS 10,214). 27 ESTC records thirteen books that can be assigned to Robert on the basis of his address and/or associates. 28 Widow Baldwin is listed in the tax books of 1748/49 and 1749/50. Paul Stephens appears in the same location in 1750/51 (Guildhall Library, MS 11,316/148, 151, and 154). 29 For discussion of the London Magazine see McKenzie and Ross, Ledger of Charles Ackers , 4-15. 30 Again it is tempting to marry off one bookseller to the daughter of another. Thomas and Susanna Astley had a daughter Elizabeth born 29 October 1731 and Richard junior married a woman named Elizabeth, probably around 1750. Two of Richard and Elizabeth Baldwin's children were christened Thomas (b. 1753) and Susanna (b. 1759). Their other children were Elizabeth (b. 1751), Samuel Birt (b. 1755), and Henrietta (23 October-December 1764) (St. Faith under St. Paul's Parish Registers, Guildhall Library, MS 8885). It is possible that Joanna Baldwin, born in Faringdon, Berkshire in 1762 was another daughter (BRO, D/P53/1/2). Such marriages were common in the eighteenth century and in the Baldwin family. Two of Richard and Robert's sisters married booksellers: Anne (b. 20 July 1726) married one Pearson, Catherine (b. 6 February 1726) married Samuel Aris (b. 21 June 1724). Details of the marriage of Richard and Elizabeth (whatever her surname) have not been discovered. 31 These moves are recorded in the tax books for the wards of Cornhill and Faringdon Within (Guildhall Library MS 11,316/145 and 148). The fire is described as "one of the most terrible, before it was extinguished, that has happen'd since the Fire of London in 1666." Accompanying the account is a detailed map of the area ( London Magazine [March 1748], 139-140). This seems to have been a serious setback for Astley. 32 One which might have been assigned on the basis of the ESTC search to the long-lived Richard senior (he outlived both his sons and died in his mid-eighties) is The Best and Easiest Method of Preserving Uninterrupted Health to Extreme Old Age —unfortunately, an examination of the imprint shows that it was sold at the Rose in Paternoster, premises occupied by his son. 33 In 1754 the father would have been at least sixty years old. Nichols writes that Baldwin "had long retired from business" at his death in 1777 ( Literary Anecdotes 3:716). He describes himself as "Citizen and Stationer of London but now of Birmingham" when he writes his will in 1771 (PRO, PROB 11/1027/6). Two of his daughters had moved to Birmingham by this time. 34 Robert also entered the September 1769 number. Richard Baldwin junior and partners—including Robert and/or Henry?—had entered the London Magazine in the register 1 December 1759 (the October and November numbers), 20 August 1759 (May, June, July), and 24 January 1760 (December, plus the 1759 Supplement). More evidence of the cousins' partnership may be found in Robert James's The Pocket Companion (1760?), "printed for R. &amp; R. Baldwin No. 47 Pater Noster Row." 35 Richard Baldwin junior's apprentices, in chronological order, were John Staples of Salisbury (3 July 1750-2 August 1757), [Robert Baldwin, 1752-1759?], Moses Staples (4 March 1755-6 April 1762), John Bew (6 March 1759-8 April 1766), William Woodfall (7 April 1761-5 July 1768), John Hempstead (bound to Thomas Pote 1 July 1760, turned over to Baldwin 2 April 1765, freed 7 February 1769), and John Cooke (3 June 1766, turned over to Henry Baldwin 4 December 1770, freed 6 July 1773) (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 37). 36 Henry was apprenticed to Edward Say 5 September 1749 to 7 December 1756, and was clothed the same day he obtained freedom (McKenzie, Apprentices 1701-1800 , 308, 427). His will is at the PRO, PROB 11/1542/116. Robert Baldwin's is at PROB 11/1510/180. 37 Henry Baldwin merits study in his own right. There is brief discussion of his career in Nichols, Literary Anecdotes , 3:716; 8:478, and in McKenzie and Ross, Ledgers of Charles Ackers , 21, 23, 26-27. 38 It was normal practice in eighteenth-century imprints to list shareholders in their order of seniority within the Stationers' Company. It is easy to imagine situations in which this practice might break down—a compositor would not delay book production just because he did not know the precise ranking of names in the imprint, for example. In general, though, the idea works and provides additional support for Richard Baldwin junior. Terry Belanger discusses the practice in chapter three of his unpublished Columbia University dissertation "Booksellers' Sales of Copyright; Aspects of the London Book Trade; 1718-1768" (1970), 48-78 (UMI 71-17466). 39 For example, Elisha's Pottage at Gilgal, Spoiled by Symbolical Cookery at Oxford is "printed for the sons of the prophets" and sold by R. Baldwin; and Philip Miller's Gardeners Kalendar is printed for the author, and sold by John Rivington, C. Hitch and L. Hawes, R. Baldwin, and others—who look suspiciously like a copyholding conger. Miller's Gardeners Dictionary is registered to a similar group 30 March 1759. 40 A conger was a group of booksellers buying copies in partnership and as such was a means of sharing both the risks of uncertain, expensive titles and the profits of solid, steady-selling titles. 41 The tax books and sewer rate books make it clear that Robert succeeded Richard and that the Rose and number 47 were one and the same place. The tax collector making his rounds early 1770 had expected to find Richard Baldwin next door to Charles Lowth and Company in the Row. Instead, their names are crossed off, Lowth replaced by James Pitt, Richard by Robert (Guildhall Library, MS 10,316/211). The sewer rates began in 1771 and conclusively link the Rose with number 47. Robert bought more property nearby (Guildhall Library, MS 2137/3). Some of Richard's shares were sold after his death by Robert, apparently at a trade sale 5 February 1771. A catalogue of the sale itself is not extant, but a receipt for fifteen shares bought by Thomas Lowndes is in the Upcott Papers at the British Library (Add. MSS 38730, f. 12). 42 There is a discrepancy between the family tree outlined here and a draft of Richard Baldwin junior's will that should be noted. Richard Baldwin junior made a memorandum of a will in his own hand dated 28 July 1769. In August he gave this to his attorney, Basil Herne of Paternoster Row, who drafted another version of the will, leaving several blanks for Richard to complete with names of trustees. Soon after, Richard took this draft to his home in Beaconsfield for his wife Elizabeth's approval, and returned it with proposed alterations, which Herne made in his hand. At some point, the attorney made several interlinear additions, some of them I believe inaccurate. For example, he wrongly places John Woodward, a trustee, in Faringdon, crosses that off, and replaces Faringdon with Leatherhead. More important, Herne adds that Benjamin, Henry, and Robert are Richard's brothers. In fact they were his cousins. Richard Baldwin junior does not describe them as brothers in his draft of the will, and the evidence of parish registers, other Baldwin wills, and John Nichols shows that the relationship was that of cousins. Richard Baldwin junior died after "a tedious indisposition" 15 March 1770, before he could approve a final version of his will (PRO, PROB 31/558/245).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Dating of the "1794" Version of Wordsworth's An Evening Walk by John O. Hayden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While we are used to identifying and tagging a philosophical concept like animism without giving it much thought, it is nevertheless an astounding belief. We can easily identify instances of animism in a number of William Wordsworth's poems from at least 1798 onwards, as in Lyrical Ballads 1 : There is a blessing in the air, Which seems a sense of joy to yield To the bare trees, and mountains bare, And grass in the green field. ("To My Sister," ll. 5-8) Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; And 'tis my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes. ("Lines Written in Early Spring," ll. 9-12) Animism, nonetheless, is so startling that when found in Wordsworth's poems it most often is taken as metaphorical or perhaps even whimsical. Wordsworth tends to help this attitude along by qualifying his published animistic statements, as he does above ("seems", "'tis my faith"). But in unpublished passages his animism is unqualified, in fact unrelenting, as it is in a fragment found in the Alfoxden Note-Book (written in early 1798): And never for each other shall we feel As we may feel, till we have sympathy With nature in her forms inanimate, With objects such as have no power to hold Articulate language. In all forms of things There is a mind. 2 Perhaps even more stark is a passage found in a revised version of An Evening Walk (lines 125-132): . . . A heart that vibrates evermore, awake To feeling for all forms that Life can take, That wider still its sympathy extends, And sees not any line where being ends; Sees sense, through Nature's rudest forms betrayed, Tremble obscure in fountain, rock, and shade; And while a secret power those forms endears Their social accents never vainly hears. 3 This last passage, however, presents a problem, for, as Jonathan Wordsworth has observed, the revised version of An Evening Walk in which it is found has been dated 1794, and nothing even remotely like it appears in his work until the spring of 1798, when "a major change had taken place" (p. 188) in William Wordsworth's thinking. Yet, despite the isolation of the passage, Jonathan Wordsworth concludes, "All that safely can be said is that in April 1794 Wordsworth believed in animated matter" (p. 187). James Averill prints the lines containing animism in his recent Cornell edition of An Evening Walk as part of "The Expanded Version of 1794," which is itself taken from two manuscript drafts in the Dove Cottage Library, DCMS 9 and DCMS 10. 4 Averill also prints transcriptions of both these manuscripts in full, and photos of the actual manuscripts appear on opposite pages to the transcriptions. MS 9 is literally a scissors-and-glue affair with passages cut from the published version and pasted in among new and revised passages written on the pages in ink. It provides the full text for what Averill calls the "Expanded Version of 1794," which is about twice as long as An Evening Walk , published in 1793, and this MS 9 contains the only copy of the passage on animism given above. The version of An Evening Walk in MS 10, on the other hand, is a good deal shorter—barely a third of the lines of MS 9. The MS 10 revisions and additions to An Evening Walk are contained in the Windy Brow Notebook along with other material; consequently, unlike MS 9, it can be dated 1794 with some certainty. 5 MS 9, which contains the animistic passage, has been given that same date a number of times; it is only the certainty that is missing. Ernest de Selincourt (I, 320) dates it 1794, and Mark Reed, having conceded that common readings between MSS 9 and 10 show MS 9 to be later, claimed that, since Wordsworth was not likely to have "resumed work on the poem once he had reached London in early 1795," late 1794 was the probable date. 6 No concrete evidence is offered in support of this supposition. James Averill, the editor of the Cornell edition of the poem, follows de Selincourt in dating MS 9 as 1794 on textual grounds, that is, on its connections with MS 10 (pp. 13, 191). First of all, however, Averill admits that "for the most part, the work in DC MS. 9 is later than that in MS. 10: many revisions of MS. 10 appear as fair copy in MS. 9" (p. 13). But Averill then argues that in one seven-line passage MS 9 is earlier; and he makes the claim five times. 7 The seven-line passage (lines 281-287 of the "Expanded Version of 1794") is not otherwise significant. Added to the description of the quarry ( Evening Walk [1793], ll. 139-150), all it provides is a vignette of a maiden come at night to moan the death of her lover, who has died while working at the quarry, but it constitutes the only hard evidence for dating MS 9 as before MS 10 and consequently as falling in 1794. Otherwise, MS 9 could have been written in 1798 or even later, perhaps even as late as 1820. The 1794 dating of MS 9, in any event, depends solely on one seven-line passage as it appears in MS 9 and MS 10: MS 9 281 To that sad spot her bosomed pain to tell lover 282 Where crushed by falling rocks her Henry fell When Love created thought wheree'er he stole Through her young veins till all her frame was soul passions passions thrilling fires 283 Fell while all warm with Joys delicious fires 284 She chid the slow moon "lingering her desires" 285 That very moon which ere she reached her wainne} 8 her 286 Led to these deep clefts to break the reign 287 Of Peace with anguish exquite as vain MS 10 281 To that sad spot her bosomed pain to tell 282 Where crushed by falling rocks her lover fell 283 Fell while all warn with passions thrilling fires 284 She chid the slow moon "lingering her desires 285 That very moon which ere she reached her wain 286 Led to these deep clefts to break the reign 287 Of peace with anguish exquisite as vain. A glance at the two versions supports Averill's contention (p. 140n.) that four changes made in MS 9 also affect MS 10: "lover" (line 282), "passion's thrilling fires" (line 283), the deletion of the added couplet (lines 282/283), and "wain" (line 285). But several words that appear in MS 9 do not appear in MS 10 as they should if MS 10 is a copy of MS 9 by way of revision: "her" (added to line 286 of MS 9, but missing from MS 10) is treated by Averill as "a copyist's error" (p. 140n.) but he seems to have missed another word, "warn" in line 283 of MS 10, which would also be a mis-transcription (for "warm" in MS 9). Averill includes in this list another word "wain" (line 285)—supposedly changed from "wane" in MS 9—but his reading of "wane" as the revision for "wain" in MS 9 is itself an error, no matter how much it might look that way on the accompanying photo. When the manuscript is examined, the reverse is clearly the case: "wane" has been changed to "wain". I suspect Averill did much of his transcription from photos, and perhaps this instance provides a good argument for the sole use of manuscripts. In any case, the probable motive for Wordsworth's revision will be provided shortly. But the other two words that differ between the two manuscripts, "her" and "warm", could have been errors of transcription had Wordsworth been copying MS 9 into MS 10 at this point. Since, however, all other work in MS 9 is later than MS 10, and since so much hangs in the balance on this one passage, Averill should have reconsidered his editorial assumptions and asked himself whether some other explanation of the revisions and "mis-transcriptions" was possible. Is it possible, he might have asked, for MS 9 to be a copy of MS 10 in this passage (as, he grants, it is everywhere else)? Not only is an alternate scenario possible, it even seems to me a great deal more plausible. My basic assumption is that revisions can be, and often are, made during the process of transcription. 9 Both manuscripts are in Wordsworth's own hand, and thus another explanation for the differences between the two versions was 1) that the poet was revising MS 10 in the process of copying it into MS 9, and 2) that he made still further changes back to MS 10 readings later. The two colors of ink tend to support this hypothesis; the passage in MS 9 was written in brown ink and later revised in black-brown ink. The passage in MS 9 (in brown ink) read as follows ( before Wordsworth went back later and further revised in black-brown ink): 281 To that sad spot her bosomed pain to tell 282 Where crushed by falling rocks her Henry fell When Love created thought wheree'er he stole Through her young veins till all her frame was soul 283 Fell while all warm with Joys delicious fires 284 She chid the slow moon "lingering her desires" 285 That very moon which ere she reached her wainne} 286 Led to these deep clefts to break the reign 287 Of Peace with anguish exquisite as vain 10 In my alternate scenario, Wordsworth made the following changes in brown ink while transcribing from MS 10: (282) He changed "lover" to "Henry", perhaps to make him more concrete, but then deleted "Henry" in the same brown ink. Perhaps Wordsworth was unhappy with the change; the maiden herself is unnamed. But he was apparently still unhappy with "lover", for he wrote nothing immediately in brown ink to replace "Henry". (282/283) He composed a new couplet apparently to expand on the relationship between the maiden and her lover. The couplet, however, was very poor, and he cancelled it in brown ink. That he returned at the beginning of the next line (283) to repeating the verb "fell" (as he had in MS 10) proves that this deletion was immediate. (283) He corrected "warn" to "warm". (283) He changed "passions thrilling fires" to "Joys delicious fires", apparently in an attempt to improve the phrasing, although neither, it could easily be argued, is very good. (284) He corrected the end of the line by adding quotation marks (omitted in MS 10) to enclose "lingering her desires", an adaptation of a line from A Midsummer Night's Dream (I,i,24): "This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires." (285) Possibly confused by the Shakespearean quotation, he changed "wain" (MS 10) to "wane" but then must have realized that there was a choice about the antecedent of "her" and wane/wain at the end of the line. "Her" could refer either to the maiden or to the moon and on the solution to that confusion depends "wane" (moon) or "wain" (maiden). Although the maiden is not said to have a wain, there are "numerous wains" in the daytime scene above (line 266) and she could have ridden one to the quarry. In any event, without a change to the wording "her wain" (with "her" referring to the maiden), the "her" in the next line (286) would have the wrong antecedent ("moon"). Since the change from "wane" to "wain", moreover, involves a write-over, the color of the ink used is not as certain as elsewhere; it could be black-brown, in which case the change could be coupled with the later addition of "her" in the next line (286). Thus, two of the changes made in brown ink during transcription are corrections made to MS 10 (the quotation marks and "warm"), three are attempts at improvements that failed and were corrected immediately ("Henry", the new couplet, and "wane"), and one was an attempt at improvement that was not changed ("Joys delicious fires"). Apparently, however, Wordsworth later went back over MS 9 with MS 10 at hand and made three other changes in black-brown ink: the addition of "lover", "passions thrilling fires", and "her" as superscriptions in their respective lines. The apparent procedure was as follows: (282) To fill the void left by the deletion of "Henry" (in brown ink), he returned to "lover" from MS 10. (283) He wrote "passions thrilling fires" (from MS 10) above the revision "Joys delicious fires", which had never been cancelled. The hesitancy noticeable in cancelling "passions" and then rewriting it suggests that he was not much happier with the wording reinstated from MS 10, and the absence of cancellation of "Joys delicious fires" suggests that he was not really satisfied with either reading—as well he might not have been—and wished to reconsider the wording. (286) He added "her" above the line to correct MS 10. He must have missed the need for "her" when he was initially transcribing from MS 10, but now he saw, as Averill put it (p. 140n.), that "Grammar, meter, and sense require 'led her.'" This explanation, I should add, is a good deal easier to accept than Averill's reverse argument that in copying from MS 9 to MS 10 Words-worth missed copying "her" even though it was written prominently above the line. Thus, of the three later changes in black-brown ink, two were returns to MS 10 readings and one was a correction of MS 10. My alternate scenario for the revision of lines 281-287 is supported, as my argument has indicated, by the colors of the inks used, colors which cannot be seen in the photos in Averill's edition but only by examining the manuscripts. Since both MS 9 and the revisions made to it are in Wordsworth's hand, it is easy to believe that he made corrections and revisions as he was copying from MS 10 in the brown ink and that he went back later and made further revisions in black-brown ink, two of them back to previous readings of MS 10. MS 10 was almost certainly an intermediate addition to An Evening Walk used by Wordsworth to produce the fuller version of MS 9, which in turn was incorporated into the version of An Evening Walk published in 1820. 11 As Averill's notes to MS 10 clearly show, MS 9 follows revisions made to MS 10 at least twenty-nine times. At several other points (lines 35, 724, and 728), Wordsworth could have been making the same sort of revisions-in-transcription from MS 10 to MS 9 that I argued above he could have made in the case of lines 281-287. Since these latter seven lines constitute the one exception to the eight hundred lines of the "Expanded Version," it is only necessary to show the possibility of an alternate explanation in order to overturn Averill's argument that a part of MS 9 is earlier and his even less plausible explanation (p. 167n.) that "for a time at least, copying in the notebooks overlapped" and (p. 13) that "it seems likely . . . that the two notebooks were active at about the same time"—whatever these statements can possibly mean. MS 10, in other words, was probably written in spring or summer, 1794, while MS 9 was most likely written some time later, probably in 1798 but possibly even as late as 1819 to 1820, when, Averill argues (p. 129), many revisions took place. Several other arguments support a later date as well. Bruce Graver, in a recent article in The Wordsworth Circle , argues that the principle of translation used to produce the Horatian ode "Blandusian Spring" (that occurs only in a note to MS 9) is very different from the kind of translation Wordsworth produced in 1788. 12 The little other evidence provides no help. The paper on which MS 9 is written has a clear watermark, but it is of no use. The paper was produced by 1792, 13 and thus we only learn that MS 9 could have been written at least as early as that date, not when in fact it was written. Then there is the passage on animism with which we began. It is highly unlikely that an idea as unconventional as animism would surface and then disappear even for so short a time as four years, although it is of course possible. And the survival of Wordsworth's animism well into the 1820's allows the dating of MS 9 to fall easily in the latter half of the second decade of the nineteenth century. In his "address to Kilchurn Castle," composed between 1820 and 1827, there occurs a passage similar to earlier instances of animism in its apparently deliberate indistinctness: Oh! there is life that breathes not; Powers there are That touch each other to the quick in modes Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive, No soul to dream of. (lines 6-9) And, as late as 1829, in a piece entitled "Humanity" we have a kind of covert animism: . . . For the Initiate, rocks and whispering trees Do still perform mysterious offices! And functions dwell in beast and bird that sway The reasoning mind, or with the fancy play, Inviting, at all seasons, ears and eyes To watch for undelusive auguries: Not uninspired appear their simplest ways; Their voices mount symbolical of praise . . . To mix with hymns that Spirits wake and hear; And to fallen man their innocence is dear. (lines 9-18) But whether the animistic passage in MS 9 was written during the period of Wordsworth's most pervasive animism (1798-1804) or fifteen years later, it was almost certainly not written during 1794, nor was MS 9 in which it is found.</field>

In conversation in the summer of 1986, Graver told me that Wordsworth's translation of "Blandusian Spring" was much closer to the kind of translations he produced in the 1820's. 13 W. A. Churchill, Watermarks in Paper (Amsterdam, 1935), p. CCVI, watermark number 233 (Britannia), dated on p. 76. Even the date of 1792 needs qualification, however. Given that particular paper moulds might be used over a number of years and that tracings like those found in Churchill's Watermarks on Paper do not always record nuances that serve to distinguish exemplars of widely used marks, it is only probable that the paper on which MS 9 was written was produced by 1792, not absolutely demonstrable.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">What Was Blake's Chaucer? by Alexander S. Gourlay</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Blake's Descriptive Catalogue for his 1809 Exhibition features a detailed account of the tempera painting Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the nine and twenty Pilgrims on their Journey to Canterbury . 1 Both the picture, later engraved on a large scale, and the Catalogue , which contains nineteen short quotations from the Canterbury Tales , evince careful study of some version of Chaucer's poem. Because the editions available to Blake differ substantially in both content and quality, establishing which one he used has important implications for those studying his pictures of the Pilgrims and the Descriptive Catalogue . Once Blake's source is known, we can better understand his pictorial responses to Chaucer and consider his performance as an editor offering a difficult text to a general audience. In the passages he quoted from the Canterbury Tales , Blake freely modified word order, spelling, punctuation, and even the words themselves in an apparent effort to make the verses metrically pleasing and easily understood by readers unfamiliar with Middle English. As a result, the approximately fifty-five lines printed in the Catalogue do not correspond closely to any published text of Chaucer, a circumstance that has led some Blake scholars to despair of finding strong evidence in the quotations themselves (Kiralis 173, Bowden 173). Most arguments have therefore focused upon other considerations, particularly Blake's reference to a note that appears in 1598 Speght and all later editions, and suppositions about his scholarly practices. But because early editors and compositors of Chaucer also introduced changes in the text, each edition differs from the others in ways that would influence spelling and wording even in a heavily modified text such as Blake's. Close analysis of the word choice, word order, and spelling in the Chaucer quotations shows that Blake used the 1687 version of the great Speght edition of Chaucer's complete works, a text that has never been fully considered as a potential source for the Descriptive Catalogue quotations. 2 Further, he still had access to a copy of this edition three years later, when it supplied the text for a pamphlet promoting the engraved version of his picture, and again about ten years thereafter, when he added five lines of additional quotations in the fourth state of the engraving. The accumulated evidence not only makes it certain that Blake used this edition as the source for his Catalogue quotations from Chaucer, but also more likely than not that he owned it. 3 There have been four published explorations of the relationship between Blake's quotations and the editions of Chaucer that were available to him. Three different editions of the Canterbury Tales or the complete works have been proposed as Blake's source: G. E. Bentley, in the 1964 Blake Bibliography , suggested that Blake used the 1602 Speght edition, and included it among the "Books Owned" by Blake (201-202); Karl Kiralis, in a 1969 article about the painting and engraving, responded with an extended but muddled review of the evidence, vigorously attacking Bentley's reasoning and concluding that Blake probably used a much better and more recent edition, the 1775-78 Tyrwhitt edition of the Tales or some reprint of it (167-74); Bentley, in the notes to his 1978 edition of Blake, reiterated his belief that Blake used 1602 Speght, this time offering somewhat sounder arguments, but also granting that Kiralis' suggestions were plausible (2:822-823) (Bentley also dropped any mention of a Chaucer edition from the less speculative "Books Owned" section of his 1977 Blake Books ); and in 1980 Betsy Bowden re-reviewed all the evidence and decided that Blake probably used yet another edition, the notoriously unreliable (but sumptuously produced and illustrated) Urry edition of 1721 (173-174). In 1984 Bentley again identified 1602 Speght as Blake's source without mentioning Kiralis or Bowden (133). A systematic comparison of Blake's modernized text and the source texts available to him suggests that he could not possibly have derived his quotations from either the Urry or Tyrwhitt texts, and that the 1687 Speght edition is much more likely than the 1602 or any other to have been the source behind the Descriptive Catalogue . This 1687 edition is essentially a reprint, with modernized spelling, of the 1602 edition of the complete works that has been specified by Bentley, who may have supposed 1687 too rare to be considered as a potential source, or imagined it to be identical to 1602. 4 The 1687 edition is not, by modern standards, a good one; it is the last and probably the worst of a long line of casually edited "vulgate" Chaucers printed in blackletter, each a copy of its predecessor that introduces a few corrections, a few more "works," usually spurious, and many corruptions in the form of progressively modernized spelling and attendant garbling of the meter. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Urry and Tyrwhitt Because the Speght editions are so similar to each other it is more important (and much easier) to show that Blake could not have derived his quotations from the elaborate 1721 Urry or the scholarly 1775-78 Tyrwhitt. This is not to say that Blake did not know of these eighteenth-century editions; indeed, we can be certain that he was aware of both in one way or another. He engraved one plate after Stothard for the Bell's English Poets edition of Chaucer, which used Tyrwhitt's text for the Canterbury Tales and Urry's text for the other works, and he surely recalled this convenient (and inexpensive) 1783 edition when he set to work on the tempera of the Pilgrims (Bowden 170). Similarly, we know that he must have seen a copy of Urry in William Hayley's library at Felpham, for Blake copied from this edition the figures of the Merchant and Wife of Bath that appear in a Chaucer portrait executed for Hayley in 1801-1803 (Wells 18-19). But Blake's Chaucer quotations could not have been copied, however freely, from Urry or Tyrwhitt, because his versions never follow the texts of these editions in the telltale passages unique to them, except in instances of coincidental revision; his quotations do, however, follow 1687 and sometimes other editions in these and most other passages. When comparing Blake's source with his quotations we can expect to find that Blake or the compositor committed a few errors in transcription or typesetting. Given the divergence of Blake's text from all editions, we can also expect to find that he made minor changes in order to fix perceived deficiencies in meter, modernized spelling (or at least made it conform to his own practice), and even substituted words in instances in which the Middle English word might be misunderstood or not understood at all. But none of these more or less predictable editorial patterns can account for all the differences between Blake's text and those of Urry or Tyrwhitt. The Urry edition is discredited as Blake's source by substantial differences between its text and Blake's. For instance, in the Wife of Bath's Prologue Urry's edition reads, "But Age alas! that all woll undermine ," whereas Blake has "But age, alas, that all will envenime," as (in various spellings) do all other editions that could have been available to him. 6 The Urry emendation is so plausible (and so unremarkable in itself) that Blake would not have noticed it unless he were carefully checking Urry against another text, which is unlikely. Similarly, Urry's description of the Squire reads, " And Songis he couth make," whereas Blake's quotation is "He could songs make," a version in modern spelling of the reading found in all other editions. Another typical variation occurs in the General Prologue . There Urry reports that the Reeve "rode hinderest of our rowte," whereas Blake (twice) has him "hinderest of the rout." Again, Urry's reading is unique, and also so unremarkable that it would have been copied without any suspicion that it was not Chaucer's. There are more than a hundred and fifty additional differences between Blake's quotations and Urry's text; most of these are trivial, but several are as telling individually as those cited above. Further, Urry's practice of spelling "ed," "es," and "en" endings "id," "is," and "in" (if they were to be pronounced) is nowhere reflected in Blake's texts; these editorial spellings usually do not interfere with reading, so Blake, who preserved many archaisms, probably would not have eliminated all trace of them. The evidence that discredits the great 1775-78 edition of the Canterbury Tales by Tyrwhitt is not as immediately compelling as that against Urry, but it is equally strong, especially when the claim of Tyrwhitt is weighed against that of either the 1602 or 1687 Speght editions. If we compare selected passages from Tyrwhitt with both Blake's and Speght's text (of 1687), it is clear that the latter is a more likely source even when it is possible to imagine circumstances under which Blake could have derived his text from Tyrwhitt's. For instance, Blake says of the Prioress: Of small hounds had she that she fed With roast flesh, milk and wastel bread. Speght's 1687 text is: Of small hounds had she, that she fed With rost flesh, milke, and wastel bread, Tyrwhitt's text differs in two important ways: Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde with rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel brede. The Tyrwhitt text is plausible, and metrically acceptable whether one reads it with or without pronouncing some final "e's" (one cannot, of course, maintain pentameter without the final "e," but Blake's text suggests that he did not recognize its function). It is thus unlikely that Blake would have modified the Tyrwhitt text here; because Speght is so much closer to Blake there is no reason to construct scenarios in which he would have done so. Ockham's razor is also useful in considering the relative claims of Speght and Tyrwhitt for several other lines in the General Prologue : Blake: He could songs make, and eke well indite Just, and eke dance, pourtray, and well write. Speght: He coud songs make, and eke well indite, Just, and eke dance, portray and well write. Tyrwhitt: He coude songes make, and wel endite, Just and eke dance, and wel pourtraie and write. The presence of "eke" in Blake's version of the first of these lines and the differing placement of "wel" in the second both argue against Tyrwhitt as source; Tyrwhitt's "pourtraie" might appear to have influenced Blake's spelling except that "pourtray" is Blake's own spelling in his Modern English description of the Franklin (the only other time the word appears in his surviving work). Additional incongruent texts occur in the descriptions of the Squire and Reeve: Blake: And kerft before his fader at the table. Speght: And kerfte before his Fader at the table. Tyrwhitt: And carf before his fader at the table. Blake: And ever he rode hinderest of the rout. Speght: And ever he rode hinderest of the route. Tyrwhitt: And ever he rode the hinderest of the route. Of the tradesmen: Blake: All were yclothed in o liverie. Speght: All were yclothed in o Lyvere, Tyrwhitt: Were alle yclothed in o livere, In the Monk's Prologue : Blake: Tragedie is to tell a certain story, Speght: Tragedie is to tell a certaine story Tyrwhitt: Tragedie is to sayn a certain storie, But Tyrwhitt's text also contains two readings that are in Blake but cannot be found in 1687 (or 1602) Speght. These, however, probably represent instances in which Blake and Tyrwhitt (who was also using Speght as his basic copy-text) made minor emendations that happened to coincide. The first of these occurs in the account of the Squire: Blake: In Flanders, in Artois, and in Picardy, Speght: In Flaunders, in Artois, and Picardy, Tyrwhitt: In Flaundres, in Artois, and in Picardie, Because this "in" appears before "Picardy" in 1598 Speght and all other sixteenth-century editions as well as Tyrwhitt, the presence of it in Blake's text is not evidence that he used the 1775-78 edition. More likely, Blake and Tyrwhitt independently concluded that the parallel structure of the line had to be continued to the end. It is possible that Blake or the compositor checked a second text containing this reading, but it is hard to imagine why either would have done so. Another reading found in both Blake and Tyrwhitt can be attributed to coincidence more confidently, for this editorial addition (once again, of a small preposition) clearly improves the scansion of a clumsy line. The text in question occurs in the Wife of Bath's Prologue : Blake: But Lord, when it remembereth me Upon my youth and on my jollity, Speght: But lord Christ, when it remembreth me Upon my youth, and my jolite, Tyrwhitt: But, lord Crist, whan that it remembreth me Upon my youth, and on my jolitee, Because Urry also contains this "on," it may be worth contemplating the implications of his version of these two lines as well: But o Lord Crist! whan it remembrith me Upon my youth, and on my jollite, The three most thorough editors (that is, Urry, Tyrwhitt, and Blake) all appear to have felt the need to adjust both lines to reach an even number of syllables. Urry, who often added unauthorized expletives to the text, inserted the poetaster's favorite expedient, an "o," in the first line. Tyrwhitt probably found manuscript authority for the "that," as have modern editors. Blake, however, decided to create a tetrameter line by subtraction rather than a pentameter line by addition; because he did not recognize that final "e" was sometimes pronounced, he must have believed that tetrameter lines were very common in Chaucer's pentameter verse. Blake's decision to emend the line in this way, and to drop the word "Christ" (an elision that is not authorized by any edition) was probably not arbitrary, though he might have cut "Lord," and even "But." One may imagine that he chose to omit "Christ" because he could not accept the suggestion that his anathema, the Wife of Bath, was a Christian, even a blasphemous one. But the Wife wears a crucifix in Blake's pictures of her, as do several other pilgrims of varying degrees of piety. Crucifixes have variable symbolic value in his work, but this one makes it unlikely that Blake was suppressing the Wife's pretensions to Christianity. More probably, in this appeal to a wide audience, he wanted to avoid stirring up the old charge that Chaucer was offensive; certainly none of his other quotations gives evidence of the recurrent blasphemies in the Tales . Thus Urry, Tyrwhitt, and Blake each responded to the weaknesses they saw in the first of these two lines with a different solution; yet faced with an even less satisfactory second line, all three arrived at the same answer, a reading that does not appear in any other edition under consideration but is accepted by modern editors. The line obviously needs a word between "and" and "my," a word with only one syllable. Because the word in question must parallel "Upon," the only candidate is "on," and each editor probably chose it independently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thynne in his Glossary" Thus Blake could not have used the 1775-78 first edition of Tyrwhitt (or its many reprinted versions—these were set by compositors who took few liberties with the material), and he did not use Urry either. Some evidence discussed at length by Bentley, Kiralis, and Bowden points weakly in the same direction. The source, or at least one of Blake's study texts, should contain a note attributable to "Thynne": Blake reports in his Catalogue that "Thynne in his Glossary says [the Tabarde] was the lodging of the Abbot of Hyde, by Winchester" (Erdman 532). As Kiralis has pointed out, William Thynne's sixteenth-century editions had no glossaries, and this note could only have been found in Speght, Urry, or Tyrwhitt, all of whom offered the same information in the same words (168). But neither Urry nor Tyrwhitt is likely to have been the source of Blake's note, for both attribute the information to Speght rather than to Thynne, and neither contains any suggestion that William Thynne, the sixteenth-century editor, or his son Frances Thynne, who helped Speght to improve the 1602 edition, contributed the glossary or the note. To the extent that this note is useful evidence, it suggests that Blake consulted an edition that contained a glossary including this note and that could have given him the mistaken impression that the glossary was the work of Thynne. Only the last two Speght editions satisfy both requirements, for no earlier or later edition has a glossary with this note that could be attributed to Thynne. Speght's address "To the Readers" in the revised edition of 1602 (reprinted in 1687) thanks the younger Thynne for his help: Mr. Francis Thynn . . . most kindly lent me his Help and Direction. By this means most of his [i.e., Chaucer's] old Words are restored; Proverbs and Sentences marked; such Notes as were collected, drawn into better order; and the Text by old Copies corrected. Blake's mistake here is entirely understandable. What is a little surprising is his spelling of "Thynne," which is not spelled with an "e" anywhere in either the 1602 or 1687 edition, but is the usual spelling of this common English name. Blake's reference to the note is also useful because it helps to discredit all pre-Speght editions, including that of William Thynne. These editions have no notes and no glossaries; furthermore, their texts all contain discrediting incongruencies with Blake's quotations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Which Speght? If Blake did not use Thynne, Stow, Urry, or Tyrwhitt, the only remaining possibilities are the three Speght editions, of 1598, 1602, and 1687. Of these, the 1598 can be eliminated immediately. In addition to containing a variety of incongruencies of the kind that discredit Urry and Tyrwhitt as Blake's source, 1598 does not credit Thynne for helping with the glossary, and, more tellingly, lists a Goldsmith rather than the usual Carpenter among the tradesmen. Because the Goldsmith is only in the 1598 Speght, as Kiralis shows (167-168), it was surely this edition that led Thomas Stothard, Blake's rival in depicting the Pilgrims, to include a Goldsmith in his version of the subject. Thus we can be just as certain that Blake did not use the 1598 Speght when he wrote the Descriptive Catalogue as we can that Stothard used it when he painted his picture. Blake includes the Carpenter and mocks Stothard's Goldsmith: "But the painter's thoughts being always on gold, he has introduced a character that Chaucer has not; namely a Goldsmith" (Erdman 540). This leaves only the 1602 Speght, Bentley's candidate, and the 1687, mine. These editions are very similar, and the claim of either is much, much stronger than that of any of the other contenders. But because they are slightly different, it is both possible and worth while to establish which one Blake used for the Descriptive Catalogue , primarily because this is part of the evidence needed to determine whether he owned or at least had consistent, easy access to a copy of a particular edition. Only spelling evidence can be assembled to distinguish between the influence on Blake of 1602 and 1687 Speght. Because 1687 is much more modern in spelling than 1602, correspondence between 1687 and Blake's even more thoroughly modernized text is not significant unless Blake's quotations show archaic or otherwise unexpected spelling that appears in 1687 but not in 1602. Many words are spelled in the modern fashion in both 1687 and Blake but not in 1602; because this is what we would expect even if Blake were using 1602, this evidence is not very meaningful. Yet four unexpected spellings suggest that Blake was not using 1602: one is a common word, one an uncommon word, and two of them archaisms that Blake never used elsewhere. The common word occurs in the Knight's remonstrances to the Monk in the Nun's Priest's Prologue : Blake: To heare of their sudden fall, alas, 1687: To heare of her suddaine fall, alas: 1602: To hear of her suddaine fall, alas: (As the full context demands, Blake rendered Chaucer's "her" as "their" in his version.) The somewhat uncommon word in question here is "indite," which was still often spelled "endite," its medieval spelling, at the end of the eighteenth century (OED; see related words as well as "indite" itself). The word occurs in the description of the Squire; 1687 and Blake spell it in the modern way, "indite," whereas 1602 spells it medievally, "endite." Because both spellings were current in Blake's day, and because he did not use the word in surviving work, it is more likely that he would follow the spelling in his source. The other two significant spellings might be regarded as weaker evidence than the unexpected "heare" or the unlikely "indite," because both "wastel" and "mokell" are archaisms. But both involve Blake's handling of the same letters in similar situations, and are therefore meaningful evidence against 1602: the only pattern in them is that Blake did not follow 1602. One occurs in the General Prologue and the other in the Nun's Priest's Prologue : Blake: With roast flesh, milk, and wastel bread, 1687: Wth rost flesh, milke, and wastel bread, 1602: With rost flesh, milke, and wastell bread, Blake: And mokell more, for little heaviness 1687: And mokell more: fro little heavinesse 1602: And mokel more, for little heavinesse</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Later Quotations It is evident then that Blake either owned or borrowed a copy of 1687 Speght when he wrote the Descriptive Catalogue . That he owned the 1687 edition is suggested by the fact that two additional instances of quotation from the same edition over the next fifteen years can be associated with Blake. The first evidence that 1687 Speght was available to him after 1809 can be found in a promotional piece for his engraved version of the painting described in the Catalogue ; this 1812 pamphlet, The Prologue and Characters of Chaucer's Pilgrims , is one of several Blakean works also containing quotations from Chaucer, but all the others are obviously derived from the Descriptive Catalogue and the quotations in them are not evidence that Blake had fresh access to an edition of Chaucer. The 61-page Prologue and Characters , on the other hand, contains most of the General Prologue in two different versions, one copied more or less accurately from "the edition of Thomas Speight, printed Anno. 1687," and the other from the Modern English verse translation assembled in 1741 by George Ogle. The booklet also includes a short introduction, signed "THE EDITOR," and two small, rather crude engravings by Blake. "THE EDITOR" is obviously not Blake; most have accepted Gilchrist's conjecture that he was Benjamin Malkin, a friend and patron (264-265). Yet the two engravings and the fact that he was the printer and publisher of the work promoted by the pamphlet suggest that Blake was involved extensively in its production, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that he provided the antiquated edition from which the Middle English text was taken. Strengthening the evidence that Blake's own copy of Speght was used for both the pamphlet and the earlier Catalogue is the appearance of five more lines from the 1687 edition in the fourth state (formerly called the third state) of Blake's large-scale engraving after the tempera, titled Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims , originally engraved in 1810. Robert N. Essick dates the fourth state c. 1820-23, about ten years after the pamphlet (68-69). Four lines from Chaucer and two Blakean mottos were lightly scratched in drypoint on either side of Blake's title and imprint; these were burnished or worn off in the fifth state. Beneath the lines from Chaucer are fainter vestiges of two more pairs of lines, making the new lines barely legible. An additional quotation, "Ye gon to Canterbury God mote you spede," at the bottom of the imprint replaces the address (until 1812) of Blake's brother on Golden Square; this line was deeply engraved and survives in the final state. The four faint lines from Chaucer that appear only in the fourth state are difficult to decipher, and Bentley, Essick and I have arrived at different readings. 7 Bentley's transcription is inaccurate, perhaps because he was studying a copy of this state that is even fainter than the one at the Huntington Library, the one transcribed here and in Essick. My reading of the Huntington copy differs only slightly from Essick's, who sees "gadrid" where I see "gadird" in the very faint third line (Essick 68-69). Nevertheless, these four faint lines and the fifth, which is deeply engraved in a clear "Gothic" lettering style, provide sufficient evidence to show that Blake copied them from 1687 rather than 1602: Blake: A morrow when the day began to spring Up rose our Host and was our alder cocke And gadird us together on a flock— *** Let see now: Who shall tell the first Tale *** Ye gon to Canterbury God mote you spede, 1687: A morrow when the day gan to spring, Up rose our Host, and was our alder cocke, And gadird us togedirs on a flocke, *** Let see now who shall tell the first tale. *** Ye gon to Canterbury, God mote you spede, 1602: A morrow when the day gan to spring, Up rose our host , and was our alder cocke, And gadird us togedirs on a flocke, *** Let se now who shall tell the first tale. *** Ye gone to Canterbury, God mote you spede, That Blake and 1687 capitalize "Host" whereas 1602 does not is weak evidence in itself; similarly, we would expect Blake to modernize the somewhat difficult "se" of 1602. But these instances of agreement between 1687 and Blake, taken together with the presence in both of "gon" rather than the "gone" of 1602, make it much more likely that Blake was working with 1687 than 1602 or any of the other editions (all of which differ even more substantially from Blake's text). 8 The inscriptions on the engraving are particularly good evidence that Blake owned 1687 Speght, for two reasons. First, the quoted lines are from three different places at the end of the General Prologue , and none of them were included in the Descriptive Catalogue or The Prologue and Characters . He must, therefore, have newly consulted a copy of the 1687 edition. Further, the project of engraving additional lines was rather casually undertaken and executed. Blake had no strong need to add lines from any edition of Chaucer, not even where the old address had been burnished out (flourishes would have served to balance the composition of the imprint at least as well), so it does not make sense to imagine that he went to the trouble of borrowing for this purpose a copy of the unusual edition that he had used ten and fifteen years before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion Blake was widely and deeply read in some subjects, and, as a result, critics sometimes expect of him the thoroughness of a modern scholar. In this instance, however, he evidently undertook a major project of literary illustration using a grievously outdated edition, relying upon it almost entirely. 9 If this fact reflects poorly on his scholarship, it does him credit as a reader of Middle English, for those using 1687 Speght were pretty much on their own in construing the text. Although the Speght editions had much better supporting apparatuses than did the immediately preceding Thynne and Stow editions, the lists of "hard words" that appear in them are based on such questionable lexicographical principles as the notion that Elizabethan speakers of Northern dialects could explain Chaucerian vocabulary; further, the 1687 glossary is only fitfully alphabetized (mostly by the first two letters), and, because the several texts and glossary had been set and reset independently by free-spelling Renaissance compositors, the orthography of a given word in a text often varies wildly from that in the glossary. The explanatory notes that appear here and there in the glossary of 1687 are sparse and hobbyhorsical, and its critical apparatus as a whole is much less helpful than that in the Urry or Tyrwhitt editions. Knowing that Blake copied his Chaucer quotations from the 1687 edition makes it possible to see exactly what he faced as an editor and reader and how he responded. Some of his decisions are not easily accounted for, such as his decision to omit "Christ" in the lines from the Wife of Bath's Prologue , but in general Blake performed competently and sensibly under the circumstances. This is not to say that he improved the text as he found it; indeed, he often exacerbated the eccentric rhythms introduced by the modernizing compositors of the Speght editions, and made some bad guesses, usually in places where the glossary was unhelpful. For instance, he appears to have decided that "Chivauchy" was a place in France once visited by the Squire: And he had be sometime in Chivauchy, In Flanders, in Artois, and in Picardy, Speght's text reads: And he had be sometime in chivauchy, In Flaunders, in Artois, and Picardy, The 1687 glossary offers only "chiuancie, . . . chivalry, riding," which is not close enough in spelling to be easily recognizeable, and not obviously appropriate in meaning. Blake's guess may be wrong, but it isn't unreasonable. Another line in the description of the Squire was no doubt modified because it bore an implication that Blake was trying to suppress. He changed the 1687 "Curteis he was, lowly, and servisable," to "Curteis he was, and meek , and serviceable." In a letter to Stothard's publisher Cromek, Blake had condemned Stothard's version of the Pilgrims for being "low" (Keynes 129), and a major theme of his Descriptive Catalogue is that Chaucer's subject is exalted. By making this change, Blake avoided implications that the Squire was "lowly" in the modern sense. Given these purposes, "and meek" is the best possible solution, satisfying both metrical and critical requirements. But Blake's scholarship is less at issue than is our own. Those who want to understand Blake's perspective on Chaucer in the Descriptive Catalogue and in the pictures themselves should continue to consult all the editions that might have been available to him between 1806 and 1825, not to mention other works commenting on the subject, but they should look first in 1687 Speght, Blake's Chaucer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Research for this article was facilitated by a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Seminar at UCLA directed by Michael Allen. Thanks to the staffs of the Huntington Library and Gallery, William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, and the UCLA Research Library for additional assistance. 2 Miskimin announced that Blake used 1687 for the Catalogue and promised to prove it later in her essay (39) . . . but never mentioned the matter again; see Bentley, 1981, on other features of this article. Miskimin was evidently confusing the Catalogue with the Prologue and Characters , described below. 3 Blake may have owned or at least used the 1741 Ogle translation of the Canterbury Tales as well; see the discussion of The Prologue and Characters below. 4 Alderson suggests that 1687 was printed merely to establish copyright, which suggests a small press run; I have seen no references to 1687 in early nineteenth-century auction records, which mention several copies of 1602. On the other hand, U.S. libraries contain many copies of 1687, and modern sales records include several copies at fairly low prices. See Alderson and Henderson, 40-52. 5 For detailed accounts of Speght and all other major editions, see Ruggiers, esp. 71-92, and Alderson and Henderson. 6 Because Blake's quotations are set in modern type, I have silently changed all texts from Chaucer by modernizing long "s," edh, thorn, and "u"/"v" and "i"/"j" to simplify comparison; italics indicate significant incongruencies. 7 Bentley offers his transcription in Writings 2:822; Essick's is in Separate Plates 68-69. Essick also provides "detail" views of the critical areas of the print (Plates 40, 41), but the reproductions are not clear enough to read with confidence. 8 Urry's text reads " The Morrow when the day began to spring," and omits "mote" in "Ye gon to Canterbury, God [. . .] you spede." Tyrwhitt reads, "and was our aller cok," and "gaderd us togeder in a flok." 9 I have seen nothing in Blake's Descriptive Catalogue or pictures of the Pilgrims to suggest that he had in mind anything in the glossaries, notes, or other editorial apparatus of the Urry or Tyrwhitt editions; he may well have looked at or recalled the Urry illustrations as well as pictures of the Pilgrims by other artists, however.

      <field name="heading_text">Shaw and Henderson: Autobiographer Versus Biographer by Ellen Summers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is common knowledge among Shavian scholars that Shaw's early biographers were, as Stanley Weintraub puts it, "saddled with autobiographer as collaborator." 1 Not so widely known are the details of Shaw's involvement in the writing of studies of his life. In the case of Frank Harris' 1931 Bernard Shaw , the biographee admitted that he had rewritten the book from its proofsheets, giving his reasons but citing none of the changes. Shaw explained that he had destroyed the proofs "so that neither I nor anyone else will ever know how much of the book is F. H. and how much G.B.S." 2 But in the case of Shaw's "authorized" biographer, Archibald Henderson, we may explore Shaw's collaboration more fully. 3 The proofsheets of an entire biography corrected by Shaw escaped the fate of the Harris proofsheets. And they show that Shaw was virtually an autobiographer. Henderson, who began his work on Shaw as a 28-year-old mathematics professor at the University of North Carolina, wrote three large volumes on his life: George Bernard Shaw: His Life and Work (1911); Bernard Shaw: Playboy and Prophet (1932); and the posthumous GBS: Man of the Century (1956). In 1960, Henderson donated to the University's Henderson/Shaw Collection the galley sheets of the 1932 biography bearing Shaw's corrigenda. In the preface to his 1956 biography, Henderson quotes the terms of Shaw's collaboration as the price of "authorization": "I authorise you, in the only rational sense of the term: I will supply you with abundant information and materials, essential facts you can learn from no one else; undertake to see that you make no errors of fact; and leave you entirely untrammeled regarding opinion and interpretation; and promise to revise your narrative both in manuscript and proof." 4 Henderson adds, "That gentlemen's agreement was faithfully kept." Closer examination of Shaw's actual revisions, however, cast considerable doubt upon this averral. Without question, Shaw provided indispensable aid to Henderson in proofreading, correcting "errors of fact," steering the book away from legal complications, and supplying what Samuel Johnson called the "invisible circumstances" that only the subject of a biography can supply. 5 In rendering this aid, he discharged his promise to help Henderson keep the facts straight. But he did not stop there. In Henderson, Shaw faced an incompatible figure, a young, idealistic Southerner whose enthusiastic response to Shaw begged to be deflated by Shaw's characteristic anti-sentimentalism. The young Henderson was another Hector Malone in his "chivalrous manners to women, his elevated moral sentiments" 6 —better suited to be a target of Shavian satire than an exponent of it. When the budding biographer betrayed his hero-worship of Shaw in the typescript version of George Bernard Shaw: His Life and Work , Shaw made his response clear: "You must come over and see me some time or other: the vision is still wildly romantic" (10 June 1906, SHC). Unfortunately for their collaboration, Henderson was and remained a good example of the sort of man Shaw was dedicated to reforming—or at least, to making uncomfortable. Though Shaw had promised Henderson in their "gentlemen's agreement" that he would leave him "untrammeled" in matters of interpretation, Shaw's corrections show efforts to offset Henderson's point of view, sometimes to the point of cutting Henderson's critical ground from under him. Shaw seemed to think that he had not unduly interfered, to judge from the letter he wrote to Henderson in late 1932 explaining why he would not write an endorsement for the biography: "I have some scruples as to interfering with your view of me which have prevented me from attempting to bring you into exact line with me" (1 September 1932, SHC). But it is hard to reconcile this statement with his corrections of Henderson's text. When in the 1932 proofs Henderson's "romanticism" erupted, Shaw did not hesitate to counteract it, as can be seen in the following case. Describing the relationships between the young Shaw, his mother, and her singing teacher, George Vandeleur Lee, Henderson writes that "Lee was a rebel in music; and perhaps, through sympathy with his mother as Lee's comrade in his musical causes and engagements (in the sense of battles rather than of appointments!), Shaw developed keen admiration for the spirit of the rebel." Shaw crosses this out and annotates in red, "This 'sympathy with the mother' is utterly false. Damn your American sentimentality" (proof page 9). Shaw could scarcely claim, however, that Henderson was the only one of the two to indulge a sense of the romantic. In another passage Shaw's comments reveal their unlike ways of imaginatively exalting women. Henderson originally refers to Annie Besant, an early friend of Shaw's, as a "beautiful, earnest 'comrade,' who dressed in Bohemian style." Shaw runs a red pen through this and remarks, "You must cure yourself of your romantic complex about beautiful women. It betrays you into writing the most abominable bunk" (proof page 33A). All the same, Shaw cherished a few delusions himself about beautiful women, particularly actresses. When Henderson tries to characterize Mrs. Patrick Campbell as a "pleasing and versatile actress," Shaw strikes the phrase, declares it "Impossible to dismiss the great Stella with this commonplace," and replaces Henderson's phrase with "extraordinary stage enchantress" (proof page 117). As usual, Shaw's version was printed ( PP , p. 383). But romanticization of himself and his background, Shaw declared, was intolerable in his would-be Boswell. "Until you know me from behind the scenes," he warned Henderson, "you may be my dupe, but not my biographer" (18 February 1905, SHC). In the same letter, he proposed that Henderson start his biography by drawing a deliberately exaggerated portrait of GBS, his "persona," and proceed by exploding this romantic image by presenting the mundane, trivial, average facts about Shaw the human being, not GBS the Superman. For the "Alone in Ireland" chapter of the 1932 biography, over 60% of which Shaw rewrote from the proof sheets, the corrections show his deflation of Henderson's "romantic vision." On page 18 of Henderson's typescript, his original account of Shaw's grandmother describes her waging "a heroic struggle to maintain and bring up, on tragically inadequate means, a family of fourteen." Shaw leaves the sentence intact, but adds, "in an unshaken and unshakeable consciousness of their aristocracy" (SHC; PP , p. 11). In Henderson's version, Shaw's grandmother is a romantic heroine; in Shaw's she is a petty bourgeoise with delusions of grandeur that make her poverty seem slightly ridiculous. To Shaw, Henderson's romantic vision created inaccuracy, and so Shaw constantly attempted to adjust the text to his own more "accurate" view of the "facts." In any case, Shaw certainly fulfilled his promise to proofread, for the proof pages of Bernard Shaw: Playboy and Prophet show the attentions of a perfectionist. Shaw cut up the proof sheets, pasted the pertinent sections on stiff manila paper for easier handling and annotating, and numbered each for reference. He wrote brief passages for insertion in black ink; "background" commentary addressed to Henderson he wrote in red. Shaw's clear handwriting and consistent method make his contributions impressive and difficult to misread. But the line between "correction" and "contribution" is harder to draw when one considers the pages of penciled draft Shaw also included, all of which appeared verbatim in the printed version. In his proofreading, Shaw proved his genius in the Carlylean sense as his "transcendent capacity for taking trouble first of all." His lists of corrigenda record dozens of corrections of errors in punctuation and spelling. Although the number of minor corrections show Shaw's diligence in small things, they also demonstrate his ability for giving trouble as well as for taking it. Either Henderson or the compositor had had persistent trouble in spelling "thoroughly," and at last Shaw, always orthographically sensitive, could stand it no longer. In one error-riddled passage, Henderson dismisses Shaw's Shakespearean criticism as "thoroughly unsound." Shaw writes in correction: "You probably mean questionable criticism. If so you should analyse it and say exactly what you make of it. Instead you fire off one of your cliché superlatives—'thoroughly [or is it to be thoroly] unsound.'" 7 Shaw also fulfilled his promise to correct "errors of fact," especially those caused by gaps in Henderson's information. Examples of substantive adjustment abound, particularly where Henderson attempts to speculate on Shaw's early life. Proof page number 6A includes this sentence of Henderson's: "I suspect the real reason why George did not shine at school was because he was so shy and sensitive, physically weak and not athletic." Shaw crosses out the remark and writes, "This is all wrong. I was not shy among schoolboys: my shyness came later, with adolescence. I was rampant, voluble, impudent, and I cannot remember ever being physically tired as a boy." Had Henderson's subject been dead, as the subjects of most biographies are, Henderson's guess would have been justifiable as the type of speculation required of a biographer to fill in small gaps in understanding; as such, it would have rested in peace. Not so with a live Shaw. As one might have expected, Shaw occasionally corrected Henderson's interpretation of his personality, as the following example makes clear. Henderson here is trying to delineate the personal difficulties Shaw had in his early London days, and his original runs: "But he was discordantly combative in argument; and his shyness took the familiar form of crude self-assertiveness and somewhat trying arrogance." Shaw emended this to read, "But he tried to learn from everyone whom he thought better informed than himself; and as his method of drawing them out was to contradict them, they were apt to set him down as an insufferable fellow" (proof page 36A; PP , p. 117). However clear Shaw's "right" to control the wording of interpretations of his character, Henderson as biographer considered himself entitled to his own interpretation of Shaw's ideas. Henderson acknowledged the divergence of their opinion in the preface to the 1911 biography: "For the views expressed in this biography Mr. Shaw is in no sense responsible. On many points we are in hearty disagreement." 8 Nowhere was this more true than on Shaw's criticism of art and literature. When they came to a showdown, however, Shaw shot from the hip and emerged victorious. In one passage Henderson attempts to discuss "Shaw's fundamental mistake, which arises from his scorn or at least disesteem for art." Shaw crosses this out, and underlines it in red, while complaining, "These inconsiderate and inaccurate exaggerations give me no end of trouble. Have you NO analytic faculty, Archibald?" (proof page 98). Shaw's version, printed in lieu of Henderson's, praises "Shaw's inhuman clearness of analysis, which enables him to insult the thinker whilst delighting in the artist. . . ." 9 Shaw was not above exaggeration either, but took care to aim it in a direction favorable to himself. As for Henderson's freedom of speech, censorship took over when he ran afoul of Shaw's own interpretation. Some of Henderson's critical judgements of Shaw's plays did not go unquestioned, and most interesting are the playwright's challenges to Henderson's discovery of autobiographical material in Shaw's plays. As Henderson discusses the close of Shaw's days as a clerk in Dublin, he writes, "And no better explanation of his departure can be found than the bitter passage of autobiography Shaw has put in the mouth of 'The Man' in Misalliance ." Shaw scratches out this statement, replacing it with "It is, however, a complete mistake to take the bitter passage he has put in the mouth of 'The Man' in Misalliance as autobiographical" (proof page 17A; PP , p. 54). This clear rebuke must have indicated to Henderson that speeches in Shaw's plays would be off-limits in discussions of Shaw's life. In the published version of this biography such speculative comments, however reasonable they must have seemed to Henderson in the draft stages, do not survive. If many of Shaw's substantive revisions cross the line between corrections of "fact" and of "interpretation," they do so not only in areas where private truths proved the biographer's analysis inadequate. In almost no relevant area, however public, was Henderson's experience sufficiently expert to assure him an authoritative perspective on Shaw's life and work independent of Shaw's own memory and will. As Shaw wrote to Henderson in 1905, because of the numerous and "watertight" compartments of his career, which included novelist, art critic, drama critic, music critic, playwright, stage director, lecturer, socialist, and vegetarian, anyone who attempted to pull together a discussion of all of these "Shaws" would have to accrue knowledge in all of these areas (30 June 1905, SHC). The direct route to such knowledge, of course, was to approach Shaw for it, as Henderson realized, to judge by the many letters he wrote asking Shaw for details. Even so, Henderson sometimes had to learn the hard way. In proof page 104A, he chides William Archer, "who refused to join with me in calling for Shaw's stage appearance at the opening night in London of Saint Joan . . . ." Shaw scolds Henderson: "This is a gaffe which would have horrified W. A. Professional critics do not applaud. It is contrary to etiquette. He would have slain you for such an inference." But taking such a route through Shavian territory left Henderson little means for independent verification or judgment, positively inviting interference from his subject. Shaw himself warned Henderson: "When you began it I knew quite well that you had no idea of what you were attempting—that a complete life of me in my public capacity would be a history of all of the 'movements' of the last quarter of the XIX century in London. . ." (17 January 1905). Shaw with justice regarded this difference in contemporaneity as a serious limit to Henderson's biographical competence. As Shaw explained to the publishing firm of Stewart and Kidd, which had written him for his opinion of the 1911 biography, Henderson had only to an extent succeeded in his attempt "to recover a biography from a period of which he, as a man younger than myself by a whole generation, and raised in another country at that, has had no direct experience" (4 September 1911; PP , pp. 761-762). A number of corrections reveal the generation gap: when Henderson writes about the "publicist, John Burns, who often addressed at Battersea Park the audience that there listened so delightedly also to Shaw's brilliant dialectical pleas in behalf of the Socialist program," Shaw retorts, "Utter nonsense. John Burns became as famous as W. J. Bryant [sic]: he cannot be mentioned in this fashion" (proof page 108). In this ad hoc manner was Henderson's education in late nineteenth-century English history supplemented. Shaw's expectation of Henderson—and it was a necessary expectation, given the scope of Shaw's professional life—was that Henderson be not merely his Boswell, but, as he informed Henderson from the start, "a possible Gibbon" (10 February 1905, SHC). It was not enough for Henderson to know Shaw's place in his times; he first needed to know the times themselves, and looked to Shaw for his tuition. But herein was laid part of the foundation for Shaw's encroachment on Henderson's "objectivity." The battle over anecdotes shows the extent to which Henderson was helpless to verify or counter Shaw's directed changes. Shaw sometimes objected to his biographer's inclusion of colorful anecdotes because they lacked Shaw's own verification. These apocrypha sometimes resulted from Henderson's misunderstanding of a story which Shaw himself had told him. Shaw's perturbation at these infelicities could sometimes amount to horror, as this response shows: on page 17 of the proofs, Henderson writes: "Little George was actually sent back and forth with notes between the bigger boys and the women of the town for the making of assignations." Shaw underscores this with red ink, runs through it with black ink, and annotates violently in red: "My God, Archibald, NO. It was my uncle at Kilkenny College. A wildly impossible libel." On the other hand, Shaw sometimes successfully transmitted information to Henderson only to withdraw his verification when confronted with the proofs. As Henderson complained, Shaw was most apt to renege on anecdotes. "It is dangerous to tell anecdotes about Shaw. I have heard a thousand; but it is impossible to check their accuracy. . . . He has repudiated, a number of times, sayings and incidents which he has personally narrated to me" ( PP , p. 692). In one case, however, Shaw let in an "unauthorized" story. In the proofs, Henderson relates this tale about William Archer, the theatre critic: On another occasion, a production of Paul Pry , Shaw tells that Archer was wrapt in slumber while a serious situation was developing on the stage. One of the characters, holding a loaded pistol, falls asleep; someone touches him on the shoulder, he gives a convulsive start and the pistol goes off with a roar. Archer, suddenly aroused from his slumber, starts wildly to his feet with a scream, automatically burying his clenched hands in the hair of the lady just in front of him. To Archer's consternation and horror, the lady's hair came right along—and Archer was left standing there, holding the wig in his hands. (proof page 78A; PP , p. 259) Shaw annotates: "This addition, quite new to me, is pure Henderson; but let it stand." Stand it does in the printed version—to good effect, though with dubious veracity. Shaw sometimes rewrote anecdotes to sharpen their comic effect, putting his own stylistic precepts into Henderson's practice. He constantly sharpened Henderson's diction: "Change 'a genuine and sincere,' which is a colorless pleonasm, to 'a reciprocally appreciative'" (proof page 31A; PP , p. 101). Most of these changes reflect Shaw's clearer instinct for the right word rather than his more specific information. An instance is Henderson's account of Shaw's "embarrassing experience" with editor Edmund Yates, for whom Shaw worked as music critic: "In his Music column, [Shaw] told a story of a notice he once wrote about a melodrama. When it appeared, he noted instantly that a passage had been cut out. On asking Yates what was wrong with the passage, the great editor gently replied: 'There is nothing wrong with it, but the fact is that the actress you mention is my mother. I thought you would not mind me cutting out reference to her.'" Henderson's version ends, "Shaw 'did not mind'—as the reference, it is to be feared, was not of the most complimentary." Shaw's annotations on the proof page add a comment after "great editor"—in the margin he writes, "Yates would be pleased"—and alters the final words as follows: "Shaw 'did not mind'—though the reference was not in the least uncomplimentary, and Yates was merely getting in a bit of sentimental acting on his own part" (proof page 94A; PP , p. 310). Henderson's original provided the facts and most of the words, in effect a rough draft; but Shaw's changes produced the comic effect. In further stylistic "improvements," Shaw occasionally directed the removal of Henderson's intrusive first-person references. But more striking are the reverse situations in which Shaw put first-person sentences into Henderson's mouth, as in the truly Shavian "I know no one who so conscientiously reasons to the logical conclusion, even when he rejects it as a reductio-ad-absurdum " (proof page 39A; PP , p. 126). In another change, which comes at the end of a six-page passage for insertion summarizing Back to Methuselah , Shaw dictates, "As a mathematician, myself, I cannot deny that the thesis of the evolution of thought as passion is possible, strongly attractive, and certainly dignified" ( PP , p. 539). To reduce possible confusion on his biographer's part, Shaw wrote above the "I" in red, "Henderson." Shaw's revisions show his obsession with being "up-to-date," and his horror of the passé played havoc with some of the strictly historical aspects of Henderson's enterprise. For example, Shaw advocated wholesale cuts in the chapters on his involvement in the theatre: "Who on earth wants to read now that 'Burgess and Lexy were capably impersonated respectively by Snooks and Hooks'? . . . All similar old press cuttings and commonplaces about forgotten casts in forgotten performances must be ruthlessly cut. They are unspeakably unreadable" (proof page 121A). At one point, Shaw slashes through a page of references to actors, quipping in the margin, "Out, out, brief candles!" (proof page 130A). Later on in the proofs, he relents to the extent of giving Henderson permission to print a list of performances as an appendix, but he adds, "To expect people to read it as literary matter is like asking them to accept a telephone directory as a romance" (proof pages 135-141). Henderson obviously differed from Shaw in his desire to record history rather than strictly "literary matter." Either purpose would be appropriate to biography, but the preferred purpose of Henderson the historian clearly lost out to that of Shaw the entertainer. Shaw ridiculed Henderson's "old-fashioned" attitude toward some of his most progressive—and at the time outrageous—ideas, especially those concerning sex and politics. He insisted upon "up-dating" the biography's commentary upon them. For example, Henderson's original criticism of The Philanderer runs, "The shocking, almost revolting character of the play, and not its demands on the 'most expert and delicate sort of acting,' made it impossible, not only at the Criterion and Independent theatres, but indeed at any theatre." Shaw excised this, writing in red, "Good Heavens, Archibald, this is Chapel Hill prudery fifty years out of date, not modern London and New York. The play wouldn't shock a convent in Connemara nowadays." Shaw substituted his own remarks: Wyndham [the actor-manager at the Criterion] could hardly have been shocked by the 'filth'; for the play is a Sunday School tract by comparison with the farcical comedies for which his theatre was famous; but the ideas and atmosphere of it belonged to a new world as yet undiscovered at the West End theatres; and the sexual part of it was deadly serious and therefore terrifying (proof page 108A; PP , p. 357). In another instance, he substituted seven draft pages of his own for three proof pages containing Henderson's belittling comments on Soviet Communism, which sounded to Shaw "like a veteran Colonel of the Civil War poohpoohing a streetcorner Socialist in 1885. Come off it, Archibald" (proof pages 75, 76 and 76A; insertion pages 73a-c; PP , pp. 250-252). Shaw's instinct for updating led him to order the alteration of certain passages quoted from previously published Shavian material, and Henderson complied—silently. Shaw had similarly tinkered with Henderson's typescript of the 1911 biography. In it, Henderson cites a passage from "Giving the Devil his Due," a review Shaw wrote of Volumes I and II of the Works of Friedrich Nietzsche: "'Mark Twain emitted some Diabolonian sparks, only to succumb to the overwhelming American atmosphere of chivalry, duty, and gentility.'" Shaw substitutes "see them extinguished by" for "succumb to," and explains, "I meant that the sparks succumbed, not that Mark did; but the passage is ambiguous; so we had better alter it." 10 Shaw felt no qualms in silently revising quotations from himself: his concern was not accuracy but clarity of effect. In the 1932 proofs, Henderson quotes from a newspaper report of a speech Shaw gave in 1896: "'I think it would be not only not dangerous, but very desirable, to have a few persons with a little extra money to spend." Shaw writes in red: "I might have said these things in 1886, but not ten years later. Reports of my lectures are hopeless as authorities" (proof page 73E). As usual, Shaw discounts the past (here represented by the newspaper record) in favor of the present (his own sense now of the way things must have been then). In spite of Shaw's overshadowing his project, it must be said in all fairness to Henderson that he was not Shaw's dupe. He was aware of the difficulties of writing a factually correct biography of Shaw in his own voice, and failed to the extent that he did only because he was outmaneuvered by his indomitable proofreader. Henderson's scholarly training directed him to consult thousands of documents, and his good sense led him to verify information acquired from Shaw through other sources whenever possible. 11 But with a living biographee who made free with the proofs, Henderson's hands were tied. He felt obliged to comply with Shaw's corrections as the price for Shaw's cooperation. Shaw's changes in his proofs were not suggestions to be considered, but corrections to be incorporated. In the end, then, Henderson's plans for a historically faithful biography gave way to Shaw's plans for the book. And what were Shaw's plans for Bernard Shaw: Playboy and Prophet? His assessment of Shaw's role in the creation of this biography depends upon one's point of view. From one standpoint, which grants Shaw carte blanche as the main source of correct information, Shaw clearly performed a myriad of services for the biography. He also quite properly clarified interpretation of his life and work where it was out of line with his own vision of either. After all, who was the final authority on Shaw and things Shavian? To the extent that he did impose autobiography onto biography, Shaw of course ran certain risks. John A. Garraty characterizes these risks in this way: "The autobiographer, particularly if he is an experienced writer, may be affected by the sound of his own words and permit aesthetic considerations to distort his recollections." 12 But the opportunity to produce a truly Shavian memoir-cum-propaganda-wagon proved too tempting. The playwright in Shaw took over: the character to be drafted, defended, extolled, was his own persona, "GBS." As Shaw confesses in a headnote to "How Frank Ought to Have Done It," his parody of Frank Harris's Shavian biography: "Dramatizing myself from an objective point of view (the method natural to me) enabled me to say things I could not gracefully have said from my own subjective angle; but modesty forces me to add, 'Errors and Self-Delusions Excepted.'" 13 Henderson's biography offered Shaw a chance to present the image of himself and of his work that he wanted to be seen, without the disadvantage of appearing to speak out of self-interest, and thus spoiling the effect. With his characteristic chutzpah, Shaw took the chance, and Playboy and Prophet was the result. We should be grateful to both Henderson and Shaw that he did.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Composition of Sherwood Anderson's Short Story "Not Sixteen" by Mary-Elisabeth Fowkes Tobin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Myths about Sherwood Anderson's life and art die hard. In recent years, critics have worked hard to dispel the notion that Anderson wrote little of value after the 1920s and that only Winesburg, Ohio and a handful of short stories are worthy of critical recognition. 1 Another notion that needs correction concerns Anderson's method of composition. Some critics have argued that Anderson wrote only when "in the mood" and was not interested in revising and reworking half-formed material. 2 Malcolm Cowley describes Anderson as "a writer who depended on inspiration. . . . He couldn't say to himself, 'I shall produce such and such an effect in a book of such and such a length.'" 3 James Schevill argues that "Anderson always had difficulty in disciplining himself to go over his work and improve poor passages." 4 Though there is, indeed, some evidence suggesting that Anderson despaired about and neglected revision of some of his longer works, it is also clear that he revised his late short stories very carefully. A demonstration of the care with which Anderson wrote and revised one of these late short stories, "Not Sixteen," will help to dispel some of these old, and erroneous, assumptions about Anderson's method of composition and make clear that he was well in control of his artistry. "Not Sixteen" was written between 1938 and 1940 in what many critics feel to be Anderson's "disastrous" late period. 5 The Newberry Library has the five versions of "Not Sixteen": a holograph manuscript, two typescripts and their respective carbon copies. The holograph manuscript, 24 pages long, written on yellow legal-sized paper in black ink, has few revisions. 6 It looks as though Anderson wrote the story rapidly in one sitting (the handwriting is larger and looser toward the end). The few corrections he made as he wrote involve words misformed, crossed out, and begun again. Anderson typed up his manuscript, again making very few corrections, and produced a typescript eight pages long (T.S.1) with a yellow carbon copy. Leaving the carbon copy of this first typescript untouched (possibly for use to check against the emended verisons), Anderson did the bulk of his revisions on the ribbon typescript, making copious annotations, corrections, deletions, and additions. To make room for all the corrections he pasted another piece of paper to the right-hand side of each page. He then typed up this heavily revised first typescript, producing a second typescript (T.S.2) and its carbon copy. 7 While typing this second typescript, Anderson made very few changes so that the second typescript and its carbon are virtually the same as the revised first typescript except for one major difference: Anderson did not complete typing the story. He stopped typing on the middle of page 10 of the second typescript and did not complete at this time the process of transcribing the story as it appears in the holograph manuscript or in the revised first typescript. The second typescript (T.S.2) and its carbon differ from each other because it is on the carbon that Anderson later reshaped the ending, incorporating some of the T.S.1's revisions and adding to that ending a few new but quite significant phrases. Many of the changes made in "Not Sixteen" (especially in T.S.1) suggest that Anderson consciously tried to write this story in the manner of his greatest work, Winesburg, Ohio . The plot of "Not Sixteen" is similar to the one used repeatedly in the Winesburg stories: a character is revealed in a state of emotional conflict, a history is then given of how the character developed the conflict, and finally the conflict is resolved in a moment of self-revelation. "Not Sixteen" is the story of how a boy, nineteen, deals with his sexual feelings toward a girl, much younger than he (not yet sixteen). We see enough of his past to know that he has a problem with self-control—he avoids the drudgery of going to school, spends his money carelessly, and, when confronted with the girl's refusal to marry him and/or to have sex with him, he has trouble coping with her determined resistance. But, because he is able to respect her strength and ability to wait until she is sixteen, he discovers in himself the ability to wait and to control himself. Pleased with himself, he says, "I have controlled myself. It is a fine thing." His triumph is only of the moment, however, for we know that he will not have enough control or determination to fulfill his fantasy of going to school and becoming a rich businessman. The style of "Not Sixteen" is also similar to Winesburg, Ohio . The prose is direct with simple subject-verb sentence structure. Gone from Anderson's style is the impressionistic and jerky stream-of-consciousness which he affected in Dark Laughter , spoiling his straightforward and simple Midwestern prose. The various drafts show Anderson systematically removing the half-sentences and replacing them with plainer and simpler syntax. In the manuscript and first typescript there are many half-sentences joined either by a dash or by ellipses. In subsequent revisions the ellipses and dashes are deleted and replaced with a period or comma, and the half-sentences are turned into simple subject-verb sentences. In the first typescript, for example, this sentence appears: "I came down from her room one night . . . it was one of the moonlight nights . . . pretty cold . . . I'd been lying up there, on the blanket beside her bed" (T.S.1 8.6-8). In contrast, in the revised typescript this sentence becomes: "He had come down from her room. It was one of the moonlight mights and cold. He'd been lying up there on the blanket by her bed" (T.S.2 10.19-20). 7 Anderson also revised repetitive sentences that had given the prose a staccato quality, thus making the sentences simpler and smoother. The sentence which in the first typescript reads "I though about that. At night, in bed, I thought about it" (T.S.1 1.11) becomes in the second typescript, "He thought about it at night in bed" (T.S.2 1.15). He also took many single sentences which stood as separate paragraphs and joined them to make a free-flowing long paragraph. In the first typescript he wrote: It was in quite a big field. There was the part of the field where the corn was already cut. You could look across it. There were the shocks of corn we had cut, standing out there. There were pumpkins on the ground, big yellow ones. Beyond the open place where the corn shocks stood there was a wood. (T.S.1 5.14-19) In the second typescript the following revision appears: They were at work in a big field and there was the part of the field where the corn was already cut. They could look across the open place. There were the shocks of corn they had cut, standing out there. There were yellow pumpkins on the ground. Beyond the open place where the corn shocks stood there was a wood. (T.S.2 7.9-12) The care with which Anderson used punctuation to form the fluid prose style associated with Winesburg, Ohio is obscured in the two published versions of "Not Sixteen" by over-zealous editors who took it upon themselves to standardize Anderson's unusual punctuation. 8 Thus, many of the nuances of phrasing Anderson so painstakingly created in "Not Sixteen" are missing from the published texts. Published posthumously in 1946 in Tomorrow and in 1947 in Paul Rosenfeld's The Sherwood Anderson Reader , neither edition of "Not Sixteen" received authorial approval. The most frequent example of over-editing is the removal of commas which Anderson carefully and deliberately placed in a phrase to stop the reader's eye and to make him consider what he has just read. This type of editorial intervention occurs in the Rosenfeld edition approximately twenty-five times. For instance, Anderson wrote in the second typescript: "She kept on insisting on it. She whispered it in the barn, at night, after the day in the cornfield" (T.S.2 1.11-12). Anderson purposely placed the commas to break up the sentence, to make the reader pause so that the impression is one of her repeating and insisting on not being sixteen. The editor, misunderstanding the purpose of the comma, removed it: "She kept on insisting on it. She whispered it in the barn at night, after the day in the corn field" (p. 836). Again, Anderson wrote: "She was shy and, at the same time, bold" (T.S.2 6.8), which the editor changed to "She was shy, and at the same time bold" (p. 840). In deleting the comma, the editor shifted the cadence and removed the emphasis on her boldness, and thereby altered the original meaning of the text. In another effort to control the effect of his prose and create a feeling of simplicity and spareness, Anderson deleted more than ten repetitive passages and revised passages that were ambiguous. The boy in the first typescript, for instance, says, "I told her how it was different with me and her" (T.S.1 6.16), and in the second typescript says, "I was afraid of her but I'm not of you" (T.S.2 8.29), a change that qualified the difference. Aware that his audience might be offended by this story of sexual attraction, Anderson carefully removed the eight passages that could be construed as over-explicit. For instance, Anderson wrote in the second typescript: "When he began to plead with her, she knew what he meant. She wanted to" (T.S.2 2.2); he crossed out in hand "She wanted to." He also removed from the first transcript: "She told me that she had seen the animals, the hens and roosters, the pigs and sheep, doing it" (T.S.1 6.19). These kinds of small but significant stylistic changes suggest that Anderson approached "Not Sixteen" with the care of a skilled craftsman and refute the idea that Anderson in his later years could not discipline himself to make revisions. Yet some critics have argued that Anderson could only make relatively small stylistic changes—"pencil work"—and was not able to make substantive improvements. Cowley writes: "He couldn't tighten the plot, delete a weak passage, sharpen the dialogue, give a twist to the ending; if he wanted to improve the story, he had to wait for a return of the mood that had produced it, then write it over from beginning to end" (p. 4). But if we look at the substantive changes Anderson made while revising "Not Sixteen," this assessment simply does not hold up. The concern Anderson showed over the ending of "Not Sixteen" is indicative of the care he gave to revising this short story. In typing up the second typescript, Anderson did not quite make it to the end of the story, but stopped transcribing the revised first ribbon typescript at the bottom of page 7 when the boy is begging "Please, please." 9 Anderson then attached the last page of the heavily revised first typescript (page 8) to the carbon copy of the second typescript, crossing out the "8" and adding the notation "11". Not yet satisfied with this ending, Anderson wrote in a large, bold hand across the bottom of this page, "Self-control is a fine thing,'." Anderson produced his next version of this story by adding to the second typescript a retyped page 10 and 11, a transcript of page 8 of the revised first typescript, making no changes while typing. Finally, Anderson corrected this last version by hand, crossing out "Self-control" of the phrase "Self-control is a fine thing," and adding in its place, "'I have controlled myself. It," thus making, "'I have controlled myself. It is fine thing,' he thought." This last version bears his signature under the title of the story on page 1. Perhaps the most significant revision Anderson made in writing "Not Sixteen" was in the revisions of the first ribbon typescript when he changed the narrative voice from the first person to the third, thus breaking away from the formula he used in most of his successful short stories. One explanation might lie in his desire to return to the effective narrative technique of Winesburg, Ohio , where a sense of profound compassion and sympathy for the main characters of the story is achieved by the voice of an omniscient narrator. In the manuscript and first typescript version of the story, the narrator, who tells of his encounter with Lillian, expresses himself in a crass manner and is incapable of understanding the significance of his own story. By changing the voice to an omniscient one, Anderson created a vantage point outside the boy and his adventure, thus investing the boy's story with a meaning and a sense of pathos far beyond the boy's ability to understand or to articulate. By changing the narrative technique, Anderson also made this pathetic boy a more attractive character. The crass, bragging quality of the boy's character in the first version is largely gone, and his thoughts and feelings seem more complex. For instance, in the first typescript Anderson wrote: "I could have stood it" (T.S.1 8.12). In the second typescript this is changed to: "He thought he could have stood it" (T.S.2 10.25). The first typescript's "struggle with her until she gave up but I didn't" (T.S.1 7.17) in the second typescript becomes "struggle with her until she surrendered but, for some obscure reason, he didn't" (T.S.2 10.2-3). And in the first typescript Anderson wrote "I got quiet" (T.S.1 7.11) which is changed in the second typescript to "he got strangely quiet" (T.S.2 9.24). When Anderson changed the story's narrative voice and created two different points of view—the boy's and the narrator's—he widened the separation between their perspectives by formalizing the narrator's language and by making the boy's more casual. For instance, on page 7 of the first typescript where the boy-narrator says "couldn't" and "made up" (T.S.1 7.20), the omniscient third person narrator says "could not" and "invented" (T.S.2 10.5). The boy's speech is revised from the first to the second typescript to contain more colloquialisms. "All right" (T.S.1 3.23) is changed to "O.K." (T.S.2 4.27) and "repair" (T.S.1 3.29) to "fix" (T.S.2 5.5); the boy in the first typescript says, "You marry some rich girl" (T.S.1 4.23); whereas, in the second typescript he says, "You marry, say now, a rich girl" (T.S.2 5.9). This separation between the narrator and the boy enables the reader to view the boy from the outside and encourages the reader to judge the boy's thoughts and actions, and yet the tone, the incidents, and the boy's character create in the reader a feeling of sympathy. Anderson's artistry in his great stories lies in this ability to make the reader feel the distance between himself and the character, heightening the reader's sense of the character's isolation, while at the same time arousing in the reader sympathy and compassion for the pathetic and often grotesque character. One of the ways Anderson makes the boy more sympathetic is by giving him some admirable character traits. Much that is likable in the boy was added when he revised the first typescript. Among the details Anderson added that enhance the boy's character are those describing his past, in particular, his experience as a swipe on the grand trotting circuit, as a factory worker in a Detroit automobile plant, and as a soldier in World War I. Added, for instance, is a paragraph of about fifty words that describes John's homecoming from the war and his acute and bitter assessment of the town's attempt to make the returning soldiers into heroes. "There had been a banquet in the town hall. He and other soldiers had been called heroes again. . . . 'All this talk. It's bushwa,' he said. 'They are handing us the lousy bunk,' he said" (T.S.2 2.14-2.20). Added also are the brief descriptions of how the boy felt about his job "on the line" in automobile factory, how the "job had got me," and how he had "chucked" that job (T.S.2 2.21-2.25). Even John's belligerent observations on patriotism and factory work make him a sympathetic character, for his anger implies a sturdy individualism, a refusal to be victimized by the forces of imperialism and industrialization. John's love of horses and horse-racing also make him attractive because the racing world represents an escape from the grind of alienating factory work and the drudgery of farm work. Anderson added a lengthy section to the first ribbon typescript that sharpens our sense of the boy's longing for an alternative to his dull life and exhausting work. Wondering what to do with his life, John considers returning to his old job in the horse-racing circuit. "It had been a temptation to John. He went to caress the horse. He ran his hand along his back and down his legs. 'He's a good one,' he thought. He thought of the drifting from town to town. In time he might become a driver. It was an old dream come back" (T.S.2 3.22-3.25). John recognizes that the appeal of life on the racing circuit is its escape from middle-class responsibilities; however, he rejects the life of a horseman for that very reason. In the course of his reflections he discovers that he has middle-class aspirations—to go to school and to get an education so that he may become a successful businessman and perhaps marry a rich woman. "If he did not get an education he would remain as he was—sunk, a worker, a man going through life with his feet in the mud. There was a ladder up which you climbed. Education was the thing that did it" (T.S.2 4.23-4.27). With the addition of a few lines, Anderson deftly portrays the boy's struggle between his love of horses, racing, and track life and his more respectable goals. "He thought of nights, in strange towns, with the other swipes. There'd be drinking, there'd be some whoring done. He stood looking at the horse. 'No,' he thought. 'I got to cut that out.' 'Those race horsemen,' he thought, 'where do they ever get?'" (T.S.2 3.28-4.3). Trying to convince himself that with an education he could become a "prosperous man" (T.S.2 4.17) and then perhaps own horses and race them, he says to himself, "OK, . . . I'll give up what I want to be, a horseman" (T.S.2 4.28-29). The theme of escape from alienating work, a theme which reoccurs in Anderson's work as well as in his accounts of his own life, is paired with a valorization of the imagination. Of all the added details the ones that perhaps make John the most attractive are those which give him a vivid imagination. In one scene he spins a fantasy for the young girl who loves to listen to him talk. He could pretend there was another world, besides the one they lived in, a world of little living things, men and women like themselves, but small, he said. "No bigger than that," he said. He put his thumb at the first joint of a finger. He began inventing. He told her that the little people lived, in the day-time, in the wood, that they hid in there. "Now see, they've come out to play," he said. "They are men and women like us," he said, "but they don't get married." Two dry leaves went skipping along. (T.S.2 8.5-8.12) Despite the attractiveness of John's imagination and his resistance to accepting his life as it is and despite the sympathy Anderson so carefully arouses in the reader for this boy, we cannot fail to see that John in his effort to overcome the conditions of his life is pathetic. Anderson strives to make very clear by his several revisions of the ending that this boy lacks sustained self-control. John is pathetic because he has rather lack-luster middle-class aspirations which he will never realize since he lacks the self-discipline necessary for achievement. John's display of self-control at the end of the story is only of the moment and not a permanent feature of his personality. We know that he will drift from job to job, his mind filled with unrealizable and half-formed aspirations. Anderson's seemingly simple story is really complex, raising moral as well as political and social questions in his portrayal of a boy who recognizes that there is something wrong with his life and yet is unable to do anything about it. The fact that "Not Sixteen" was very deliberately and carefully revised supports the contention that, despite what many critics have suggested, Sherwood Anderson, even after 1925, was a serious craftsman who was concerned about producing certain effects through his art. That Anderson returned to the mode of narration, form, and style of Winesburg, Ohio shows how in his later years he abandoned affected Joycean forms and began to come to terms with his own great contribution to American literature—the simple and direct Midwestern prose and a story that evokes a bittersweet yearning in the reader. In the middle and late 1930s Anderson produced some of his best literature. Besides the monumental Memoirs , he wrote great short stories—among them, "The Corn Planting," "Nobody Laughed," and "Not Sixteen." A careful study of the typescript states of "Not Sixteen" and the final intended version of the story shows Anderson to be a dedicated artist and craftsman even after 1925. Similar studies of the composition of some of Anderson's other late works should further corroborate this point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 A major contributor to this notion of deterioration is Irving Howe, especially in a chapter "The Downward Curve" of Sherwood Anderson (1951). More recent criticism beginning in the mid-60s and culminating in 1976 with the celebration of Sherwood Anderson's centennial has tried to counter such negative assessments of Anderson's life and work. See, in particular, David D. Anderson's introduction to Sherwood Anderson: Dimensions of his Literary Art (1976), his introduction to Critical Essays on Sherwood Anderson (1981), his critical biography, Sherwood Anderson: An Introduction and Interpretation (1967), and his essay included in Hilbert Campbell's Centennial Studies (1976). Also see Walter B. Rideout's introduction to Sherwood Anderson: A Collection of Critical Essays (1974) and Ray Lewis White's The Achievement of Sherwood Anderson (1966). 2 William L. Phillips suggests that Anderson himself may have been partly responsible for promulgating this myth; Phillips quotes from Anderson's memoirs: "I am not one who can peck away at a story. It writes itself, as though it used me merely as a medium . . . . The short story is the result of a sudden passion. It is an idea grasped whole as one would pick an apple in an orchard. All of my own short stories have been written at one sitting." Phillips points out that Anderson's own accounts of his method of composition are often tinctured with "romantic subjectivity." Trying to determine how Anderson really wrote his stories, Phillips examines the manuscript of "Hands." He concludes that "the story, although first drafted in a 'sudden passion' was reworked several times." "There are . . . two hundred instances in which earlier words and phrases are deleted, changed, or added to, to provide the readings of final published version of the story." "Not Sixteen" like "Hands" seems to have been written in one sitting, but then, like "Hands," was heavily revised. See Phillips, "How Sherwood Anderson Wrote Winesburg, Ohio ," American Literature 23 (1951), 7-30, especially pp. 19-21. 3 Malcolm Cowley ed., "Introduction," Winesburg, Ohio (1984), p. 3. This myth may be slow to die because Cowley's introduction to Winesburg, Ohio, published first in a 1960 Viking edition, is now attached to the popular Penguin edition which has undergone 14 printings in the past 10 years. 4 James Schevill, Sherwood Anderson: His Life and his Work (1951), p. 235. 5 Paul Rosenfeld says "Not Sixteen" was written in 1940. See The Sherwood Anderson Reader (1947), p. 836. However, an earlier date can be deduced from material found in the Newberry Library folder which contains the holograph manuscript and typescripts of this story. A hand-written note, most likely Mrs. Eleanor Anderson's handwriting as it matches the word "finish" on one of the typescripts (see note 9 below), contains a few phrases describing the subject matter of the story ("Spanish Amer War," "What Chance (Horse)"), a reference to a letter from Chambrun, his literary agent, with the date of August, 1938, and a list of the magazines this story was sent to— Harpers , Mercury , Atlantic Monthly , College Humor , and For Men Only . 6 I gratefully acknowledge the Newberry Library's and the Sherwood Anderson Estate's permission to quote from this material. 7 I have chosen out of convenience to use the notation T.S. 1 to refer to the first typescript before he revised it as indicated by the carbon copy. T.S. 2 refers to the second ribbon typescript which is virtually the same as the heavily revised first ribbon typescript until page 10 of the new typescript. 8 Ray Lewis White comments on the fact that most editors and critics think that because Anderson had only one year of high school education, he did not understand comma placement. White writes: "The grand assumption—a false one—among all previous editors of Sherwood Anderson's manuscripts has been that the author knew nothing about the mechanical preparation of his writing for publication. The fact is that Anderson was by no means ignorant of paragraphing, punctuation, and grammar. . . . Sherwood Anderson knew how to write as he wanted his material read—slowly, carefully, each sentence building itself by progressive relative clauses and separate phrases into a full, often complicated structure and thought." (See his "Introduction," Memoirs [1969], p. xxxvi.) Editors confronted with Anderson's loose and apparently formless sentences often standardized and stiffened his free flowing prose and ignored his clearly marked episode spacing and paragraphing. White says that "one would not exaggerate in speculating that almost no essay or book by Anderson was published as the author intended in his manuscripts." (See White's "Introduction," Marching Men [1972], p. xxv.) 9 On the last page of the carbon of the second typescript, page 10, the word "finish" is written in a hand other than Anderson's, probably Mrs. Eleanor Anderson's, as she often took a supervisory role in the production of his writing.</field>
