      <field name="heading_text">The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1942 Jacob Blanck remarked that "one who attempts a bibliography of almost any nineteenth-century American author has embarked on a task that may prove endless." 1 All bibliographies are endless tasks, but this statement calls attention to the paucity of bibliographical work upon which the student of an American author can draw. One may feel that the situation has now improved, as a result not only of the bibliographies published in the intervening twenty-five years and the increased attention to American literature in bibliographical journals but also of the monumental Bibliography of American Literature (1955- ), effectively conducted by Blanck himself. This work is currently providing the first bibliographies of many authors and the first dependable ones of many others. But the BAL is not — nor is it intended to be — a substitute for full-length detailed bibliographies of individual American authors. Unhappily, then, it is still possible to say that we do not have an entirely satisfactory bibliography for a single major American writer. That this judgment is not unduly harsh can be demonstrated by a brief survey of past accomplishments — or, indeed, by momentary reflection. For, aside from BAL , what is there for Emerson and Hawthorne? Where does one go for Melville or Whitman or Thoreau, for Hemingway or Faulkner? The bibliographies of Poe and Mark Twain, of James and Eliot, have their strong points, but even here much remains to be done. It has become a cliché to say that no bibliography can please all its users, because they come to it with such various purposes; and some kind of mortal antipathy between scholars and collectors is usually cited. The foolishness of this point of view is, fortunately, becoming more recognized year by year, as scholars begin to see the relevance of physical details (the collector's "points") to the establishment of a sound text and as collectors begin to understand that their duty, as preservers of the records of the past, extends as much to late reprints as to first "editions." Scholars should be grateful that the interest in first "editions" provided the incentive for the earliest bibliographical work on American authors; but the day has passed when a bibliographer can announce without any sense of shirking his responsibility — as H. W. Cathcart did in his 1905 bibliography of Hawthorne — that he has made no attempt to enumerate later editions "as they could be of no use to the collector of first editions." Today both collectors and scholars — if they are serious (and there are perhaps more dedicated men in the first group than the second) — demand the same things of a bibliography: that it provide a complete account (as complete as surviving material permits) of the publication of a given author's writings, that it be a history of the forms in which those words have been presented to the public, from their initial appearance to the present day (or some other specified point in time). To criticize presently available bibliographies for not being "entirely satisfactory" is not, therefore, to ask naively for an impossibility; admittedly bibliographies will always be riddled with errors and will always be unfinished, but they can at least be satisfactory — from the point of view of all their users — in their approach to the material. Too often the question of approach is narrowed down to one of technique or form, and many futile misunderstandings have arisen because one man did not approve of the collation formula used by another or did not want to make the effort required to comprehend it. Prefaces to bibliographies abound with deprecatory allusions to bibliographical debates, which the author of the bibliography has avoided by his wholesome "common-sense" (and often quite unscholarly) method. Such a passage as the following, from W. B. S. Clymer and C. R. Green's 1937 bibliography of Robert Frost, belies certain very real merits which the work possesses: . . . our only objective has been to describe the items involved in such a manner that they can be identified beyond a doubt. If we have succeeded in doing this, we shall not worry very much over whether or not this or that particular school of thought has been upheld or contradicted. Surely this is a curious kind of logic to find underlying a scholarly investigation. Standardization of the form for recording bibliographical details is obviously a desideratum, and the choice of an appropriate form in any given instance has a direct bearing on the resulting quality and usefulness of the "content" — in other words, any argument about form, separated from a context, is misguided. One would expect bibliographies published since 1949 — the year of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description — generally to exhibit a superior deployment of material. But to say this is not to imply that the chief criterion of a bibliography is necessarily its adherence to the formal recommendations set forth there; to do so would be grossly to misunderstand the purpose of that work. A more meaningful statement would be that neglect of (or hostility to) the Principles in a bibliography is often symptomatic of an omission of important information — if not of an unscholarly approach to the material. One of the most important services which the BAL is performing may well turn out to be the widespread attention it is drawing to the fact that scholars and collectors require the same kind of bibliography. It gives collations of gatherings (not simply pages) for nineteenth-and twentieth-century books; it is more precise than previous bibliographies in describing publisher's cloth, with all references keyed to photographs; and, most important of all, it records later impressions and editions, not just the first or second. The writers of author-bibliographies must recognize that their research provides information not merely about one author but about the publishing and printing practice of his time; if a bibliography is not conceived of as a record of the forms of publication of certain written works (rather than the minimum amount of information deemed necessary for identification of certain editions or impressions), it is not contributing to the store of bibliographical knowledge that will enable the next author-bibliographer to reach conclusions otherwise impossible. 2 One can never know which facts, considered unimportant at present, may take on significance in the future through the fuller accumulation and analysis of data. The record should therefore be as full as possible, and it is at this point that formal considerations enter. Clearly, as Madan pointed out long ago, 3 there must be a degressive principle by which certain materials are treated less fully than others — but not of the sort which allows a bibliographer to append to a relatively elaborate description of a first impression a brief list of later imprints (not even distinguishing between impressions and new editions). If one major fault can be singled out in the American author-bibliographies of the past, it is their almost total failure to provide genealogies of editions — to trace the course of a given text through various sets of plates (perhaps issued under different imprints but from the same setting) or various later editions; and this essential information can be presented only if the bibliographer is willing to examine late printings with the care he bestows on early ones and to admit that he cannot ignore textual matters. American literary scholarship at the present time offers a unique opportunity for the production of this kind of author-bibliography on a wide scale. The intensive textual work now in progress on many major nineteenth-century authors under the general leadership of the Modern Language Association's Center for Editions of American Authors forms the perfect base for descriptive bibliographical scholarship, for most of these projects are forming excellent collections of books (both early and late printings) and are inevitably in the process discovering many new textual changes, binding variants, impressions, and issues. For example, the discovery of duplicate typesetting in the first edition of The Scarlet Letter and of altered standing type in the second, as announced in the Centenary Hawthorne, provides a striking demonstration of the interdependence of detailed physical description and textual decisions. It would be a sad loss if such information were not organized into bibliographies, and most of these projects have happily made arrangements for the preparation of a bibliography in connection with their new edition — among those so far announced are bibliographies of Irving, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Mark Twain. On the eve of so much activity, it seems appropriate to review the past course of American author-bibliographies. The story is not only a chapter in the history of American scholarship; it is an object lesson as well. * * * * * * Interest in American bibliography was at first directed toward the broad field of "Americana" in general, and it would be possible to see its origins in such enumerations as Bishop White Kennett's Bibliothecae Americanae Primordia (1713), Obadiah Rich's Catalogue of Books, Relating Principally to America (1832), or Henri Ternaux's Bibliothèque Américaine (1837). The only description contained in the early nineteenth-century lists, however, was an occasional indication of format (a simple "4to" or "8vo"), as in D. B. Warden's Bibliotheca Americo-Septentrionalis (1820), Nicolas Trübner's Bibliographical Guide to American Literature (1855), and certain sale catalogues (like John Russell Smith's Bibliotheca Americana , 1865); but Harrisse's Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima (1872 additions) included quasi-facsimile transcriptions of title pages. Henry Stevens, that illustrious American in London, issued in 1854 his short-lived periodical Stevens's American Bibliographer , for the publication of trial versions of descriptions to be included in his larger work; some of them indicated line-endings in title-page transcriptions. There followed a stream of works from his hand, and he opened the first volume of his Historical Nuggets (1862) with a passage which has been re-echoed by many later bibliographers: The highest incentive, then, that actuates the maker of catalogues is the fear of disgrace for a bad one, while he knows that a good one will bring him no applause. The day may come, however, when the varied knowledge, the patience, the perseverance, and the industry of the true bibliographer will take their true rank, and he be rewarded according to his aim and his labours (pp. v-vi). Joseph Sabin, whose publication in 1868 of the first part of his great Bibliotheca Americana marked an important step forward, was also carrying on a campaign for higher bibliographical standards in the columns of his house organ, the American Bibliopolist , during the early 1870's (9 vols., 1869-77). Its pages furnished a place for the exchange of bibliographical notes and queries, and he issued with it "A Handy Book About Books," with useful information for bibliographers. By 1870 he was using vertical lines to indicate line-endings in title-page transcriptions (II, 180-187), and in an 1873 article entitled "What Is Bibliography?" he announced, "We define material bibliography to consist of a careful copy of the title, place, date, size, &amp;c., of a book" (V, 84-86). He went on to explain the meaning of format and even proposed a professorship of bibliography: "Then perhaps we may find the meaning of the word will be more widely known" (V, 87). In the same year that Stevens was remarking in his Nuggets , "We have never seen a perfect Catalogue" (III, vi), the New York firm of Leon &amp; Brother issued its famous catalogue, First Editions of American Authors (1885), generally considered the first checklist to reflect the growing interest in collecting American literature as opposed to general Americana. 4 It was not of course descriptive, but it listed for sale the complete works of an amazing number of authors and, perhaps even more surprisingly, stressed in its preface the importance of first editions from a textual point of view: "they are of the highest bibliographical and literary interest. . . . they often contain passages or poems which are omitted from later editions. . . . by collecting the first editions of an Author we have the benefit of a pure and unchanged text." This catalogue was followed in 1893 by Herbert Stuart Stone's First Editions of American Authors (with an introduction on contemporary collecting and collectors by Eugene Field) and in 1897 by Patrick K. Foley's American Authors, 1795-1895 . These works had a long period of usefulness (and are still referred to occasionally) because of the large number of authors included. But the checklist which has dominated the field is Merle Johnson's American First Editions , first published in 1929. Johnson did not describe the books listed but attempted to mention points which would identify their true first printings. His pioneer use of type-batter evidence (here and in his Mark Twain bibliography) was often misunderstood and ridiculed, and some collectors preferred the easier path offered them by Foley — an attitude satirized in a jingle by Oscar Wegelin: "Some letter dropt, a broken type, / How very, very drolly; / Such things as these, were ne'er thought of / By dear friend P. K. Foley." 5 Johnson revised his work in 1932, and Jacob Blanck brought out further revised editions of it in 1936 and 1942; 6 its continued popularity is indicated by the fact that a fifth printing of this fourth edition was issued as late as 1965, and some people now are as hesitant to relinquish it for BAL as they were to give up Foley three decades before. Other works appeared in the early thirties, offering somewhat more detailed examinations of a smaller number of books, such as Richard Curle's Collecting American First Editions (1930), Jacob Schwartz's 1100 Obscure Points (1931), or I. R. Brussel's Anglo-American First Editions : West to East (1936). In 1950 Carroll A. Wilson's Thirteen Author Collections of the Nineteenth Century provided better descriptions than had previously been available for most of the eleven American authors included. And the BAL in 1955 was the culmination of this tradition of multiple-author bibliographies, far removed from the checklists which were its ancestors. The growth of interest in collecting and in bibliography, of which these works give evidence, forms the background against which the development of the book-length single-author bibliography should be viewed. One does not begin to look for this sort of publication before the last years of the nineteenth century, the period when many scholarly organizations were founded on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States attention was first given to the statesmen, with the Bibliotheca Hamiltoniana (by Paul Leicester Ford, 1886), Bibliotheca Jeffersoniana (by Hamilton B. Tompkins, 1887), and Bibliotheca Washingtoniana (by William S. Baker, 1889); and Wilberforce Eames in 1890 and 1891 investigated the bibliography of Eliot's Indian works. By the turn of the century the only literary figures who had been treated were Franklin (by Paul Leicester Ford, 1889), Thoreau (by Samuel Arthur Jones, 1894), and Thomas Bailey Aldrich (by Francis Bartlett, 1898). These contained little description; but the indication of line-endings, format, and pagination in Jones's Thoreau , for example, provided at least as much information as was available in the English bibliographies then published — James Gibson's Burns (1881), Wise and Smart's Ruskin (1893), Temple Scott's or Buxton Forman's Morris (both 1897), or Wise's Browning (1897). The first decade of the twentieth century saw a flurry of American author-bibliographies, largely created by the Houghton Mifflin Company's consciousness of its heritage, as the successor to the great firm that had published so much of the important nineteenth-century literature. In 1905 it began the first American series of author-bibliographies, with Nina E. Browne's A Bibliography of Nathaniel Hawthorne . The works in this series were not really descriptive at all (since they gave a short — or sometimes full — title for each book, followed by pagination and a symbol to represent size), but — since the publisher's files were at hand — they furnished more information about publication and number of impressions than one might have expected, particularly the full listing of later editions (with no attempt, however, to show relationships of plates). The bulk of each volume consisted of an alphabetical list of individual works, with an indication of the first periodical and first book appearance of each. Hawthorne was followed in 1906 by George W. Cooke's Lowell , in 1907 by George B. Ives's Holmes , and in 1908 by Francis H. Allen's Thoreau and Cooke's Emerson . All five volumes were arranged on the same plan, but some (like Holmes and Thoreau ) indicated line-endings in full titles. Earlier in the decade Oscar L. Triggs had prepared a Whitman bibliography (in Complete Writings , X [1902], 139-233), but it was inconsistent in providing title-page transcriptions and was not intended to be descriptive. Two library lists of this period were Hamilton B. Tompkins's George Henry Calvert (1900) and Winifred Mather and Eva G. Moore's Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1906). Victor H. Paltsits in 1903 made a step forward in A Bibliography of the Separate and Collected Works of Philip Freneau . Not only did he give line-endings and an indication of size (in format terms); he also recorded signatures (as "[A]-C in fours"), reproduced many title pages, and listed locations of copies. In 1905, besides Browne's Hawthorne , two other bibliographies of Hawthorne appeared. One of them, by Wallace Hugh Cathcart for the Rowfant Club, was clearly aimed at collectors and thus complemented Browne's: while it took up only first "editions," it indicated line-endings and bindings, even offering some discussion of states and binding variants. The other was Jacob Chester Chamberlain's description of his own collection, which in a sense began another series, for Luther S. Livingston's Longfellow in 1908 was presented as one of "The Chamberlain Bibliographies" (Livingston noted line-endings and bindings but gave collations of gatherings only if signatures were present). One other bibliography of this decade was LeRoy Phillips's A Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James (1906); though it indicated line-endings, it was very meager in its offering, allowing "Cloth," for example, to suffice for a binding description and declining to investigate the complicated matter of James's transatlantic publication — nor were its faults removed in the "enlarged edition" of 1930. 7 Near the end of the decade the theory of bibliographical description was enormously advanced by the remarks of Pollard and Greg, 8 but the result was not to stimulate author-bibliographies on this side of the Atlantic, for only two are noteworthy in the entire second decade: Livingston's Lowell in 1914 (parallel to his Longfellow ) and Charles F. Heartman's Hugh Henry Brackenridge in 1917 (not the first and by no means the last of his bibliographical publications). These were also the years of F. F. Sherman's checklists ( Bliss Carman , 1915; Thomas Bailey Aldrich , 1921). The decade of the 1920's, however, is a different matter. The general prosperity made book-collecting popular, and the interest in "modern firsts" as well as the rediscovery of earlier authors (notably Melville) prompted bibliographies of those writers. Frank Shay's Walt Whitman in 1920 provided scant information, but Meade Minnigerode's Some Personal Letters of Herman Melville and a Bibliography (1922) attempted much more, giving line-endings, pagination and format symbol, unusually full contents list, binding description, and price. For some books he furnished a long essay of commentary, including an account of textual variants and quotations from reviewers, and he tried to list later printings. 9 This book was published by Edmond Byrne Hackett under his imprint of The Brick Row Book Shop, which was to reappear in 1927 on Lawson M. Melish's bibliography of Edith Wharton; like Minnigerode, Melish gave special attention to his lists of contents, noting divisional titles and plates. Although his formula for pagination, such as "pp. (viii) + 254," was inadequate, as usual at the time, he did give exact measurements of pages and discussed bindings. The other bookshop which issued bibliographies in the twenties — even more actively — was the Centaur Book Shop of Philadelphia. Each volume in "The Centaur Bibliographies of Modern American Authors" was a small, attractively produced limited edition, printed at the Torch Press, generally carrying a prefatory essay by the author involved; since many of the authors were only in mid-career, blank pages were included at the end labeled "Future Collations." The first in the series, in 1922, was H. L. R. Swire's A Bibliography of the Works of Joseph Hergesheimer . For each first edition it gave a title-page transcription with line-endings marked (not quasi-facsimile); then a paragraph called "Collation," which began in the pattern of "pp. (vi) + 327, consisting of . . ." and proceeded with the contents; then a paragraph indicating size (as "Crown 8vo, 7¼ x 4⅞"), binding material, lettering on the binding (transcribed), end papers, and edges; and finally a note on variant bindings, special issues, or later editions. It represented what was generally expected of a collector's bibliography at the time, and the other volumes followed in an unusually consistent fashion: Vincent Starrett's Stephen Crane in 1923; Guy Holt's James Branch Cabell , Carroll Frey's H. L. Mencken , and Scott Cunningham's Carl Van Vechten , all in 1924; Edward H. McDonald's Theodore Dreiser in 1928 (which included reference to English editions, but only from the English Catalogue ); Vincent Starrett's Ambrose Bierce in 1929; and I. R. Brussel's Cabell (a thorough revision of Holt) in 1932. The other bibliographies of the twenties were less satisfactory. Carolyn Wells and Alfred F. Goldsmith's A Concise Bibliography of the Works of Walt Whitman (1922) was generally vague, though it gave brief binding descriptions. 10 Henry Cole Quinby's Richard Harding Davis (1924) used the form "12mo, 19 cm." for size, followed by contents, total pagination, binding, publication information, and very discursive notes. Only occasionally would he mention gatherings, in footnotes which illustrate the unnecessary complications created by the use of format designations for size: one footnote on "12mo" reads, "So according to the size rules of the American Library Association and in the publishers' advertisements; but really and truly, it is composed of eight-leaf signatures" (p. 18). Joseph Lawren's James Gibbons Huneker (1925) gave nothing more than title-page transcriptions and lists of contents; Oscar Wegelin's John Esten Cooke (1925) was another in Heartman's Americana series. In 1929 Vrest Orton's Dreiseriana (labeled as one of "The Chocorua Bibliographies") presented details about the publication of Dreiser's work (including some later editions) in essay form, with occasional interspersed collations; it is best described by its subtitle, "A Book About His Books." To find the outstanding author-bibliography of the decade, one must turn from these separately published works to one which was part of a larger undertaking, Wilberforce Eames's bibliography of John Smith for the twentieth volume (1927) of Sabin (pp. 218-265). His title-page transcriptions (with line-endings) and formula for pagination, as "4to, pp. (8), 1-19, 24-42," were not above the general standard, but they were followed by an enormous quantity of annotation in small type, giving the contents and facts of publication and revealing the painstaking work which lay behind the bibliography. Thomas H. Johnson has with justice called it a "model of bibliographical scholarship in dealing with an extraordinarily complex subject"; 11 if Eames's formulas have been surpassed in precision, his careful notes are still impressive. Despite the Depression, a large number of bibliographies were published during the thirties. If the collecting fever had called attention to the need for bibliographical studies of American authors, the wholesale revaluation of the American past in the twenties intensified the demand; the result was not only more bibliographies, but more scholarly ones. The decade is framed by one of the monuments of American bibliography: in 1930 Thomas J. Holmes issued Increase Mather and His Works , a short-title list serving as a preview to the two-volume Increase Mather which appeared the following year; and in 1940 he published the three-volume Cotton Mather as well as a volume on The Minor Mathers . At the time of its inception, this work represented the most serious bibliographical attention which had yet been paid to an American author (or group of authors) and the first extensive use of title-page reproductions in an American bibliography. It employed format terms accurately, reported gatherings in concise fashion, located copies, and noted later printings. One objection which may be raised is that its alphabetical arrangement of material is not as meaningful as a chronological one would have been; also, the generous inclusion of title-page facsimiles for all major titles does not obviate the bibliographer's responsibility for complete quasi-facsimile transcriptions. Even with its faults, the Increase Mather demonstrated more clearly than any previous American work that descriptive bibliography was a scholarly discipline, and I think it may fairly be said that it is the earliest American author-bibliography which does not need to be done over. 12 The general output of these years was characterized by continued attention to contemporary or recent writers, as in the twenties, with a simultaneous effort to treat the standard nineteenth-century authors in more detail. As for the moderns, Bradford F. Swan's Henry Blake Fuller came in 1930; and 1931 alone saw Lucius Beebe and Robert J. Bulkley's Edwin Arlington Robinson , Ralph Sanborn and Barrett Clark's Eugene O'Neill (which included English editions), Cecil Johnson's George Sterling , Edwin O. Grover's Percy MacKaye (a "biographical bibliography"), and Louis H. Cohn's Ernest Hemingway . These were not distinctive, but they generally provided the expected notes on pagination, contents, and binding (collation of gatherings was not expected) and sometimes offered title-page reproductions. The Hemingway , though it gave no publication data, did recognize textual matters, to the extent of saying, "There are slight textual differences between the American and English editions of Men Without Women " (p. 46); but its imprecision in the use of bibliographical terms is shown by another comment on the same book: "The first edition of this book may be determined by its weight only, as the second printing of the book took place without any typographical changes or corrections" (p. 29). In 1932 Barton Currie's Booth Tarkington gave prices and publication facts, along with the usual listing of total pagination (called "collation"), contents, and binding; but Lucile Gulliver's Louisa May Alcott was hardly descriptive (with "16mo, cloth"), yet it did allude to binding variants, sometimes gave the size of editions, and listed foreign editions. By this time title-page transcriptions indicating line-endings — but not in quasi-facsimile style — were a standard element of an author-bibliography, but the imprecise account of pagination became, if anything, more cumbersome, as "1 blank leaf + pp. xxii + pp. 204 + 2 leaves," in Lavinia R. Davis's bibliography of Edith Wharton (1933). 13 A number of other bibliographies in these years followed the same general pattern and require little comment: Sydney S. Alberts's Robinson Jeffers and Harvey Taylor's Sinclair Lewis in 1933, P. D. and Ione Perkins's Lafcadio Hearn in 1934 (the descriptions are proudly announced as made "from actual inspection"), 14 Alfred P. Lee's Christopher Morley in 1935 (significant for its attention to dust jackets and its measurement of the type-page), Alexander C. Wirth's Lizette Woodworth Reese in 1937, W. B. S. Clymer and C. R. Green's Robert Frost in 1937 also (with thorough notes on binding variants, and format terms used for "foliation rather than size"), 15 Paul S. Clarkson's William Sydney Porter in 1938 (the size of gatherings is indicated — as "in eights" — without saying how many), Arthur Mizener's Archibald MacLeish in 1938 also, and A. J. Hanna's Irving Bacheller in 1939 (with very little description but data on number of copies in each printing). Against this background six bibliographies of the thirties, on six major authors, stand out. First, William R. Langfeld and Philip C. Blackburn's Washington Irving (1933) — which originally appeared in installments in the Bulletin of the New York Public Library in 1932 — provided very careful discussions of each work, including comments on textual variations among the earliest printings or editions; its weaknesses were a failure adequately to define terms like "issue" or "state," a neglect of signature collation, and the omission of information on later editions. This last fault was recognized by Stanley Williams, who called it a "collector's bibliography" which laid "foundations for studies of later editions"; 16 he — with Mary E. Edge — proceeded to furnish such a study in 1936 ( A Bibliography of the Writings of Washington Irving ), attempting to list all editions and translations, but with no discussion of textual matters and no bibliographical description. In 1934 two major authors were treated. One was John W. Robertson's Edgar A. Poe , in two beautifully printed volumes from the Grabhorn Press, the second of which was a "commentary" on the bibliography in the first. The work is useful for the numerous title-page reproductions but is unsuccessful in its attempt to show spacing in transcriptions and provides no formulary collations. The other, A Descriptive Bibliography of the Writings of James Fenimore Cooper by Robert E. Spiller and the Irving bibliographer Philip C. Blackburn, revealed a more thoughtful concern with bibliographical principles. Defining an author-bibliography as "the record of his literary life" (thus including more than just first "editions"), they recognized "the immaturity of the science" of bibliography for modern books in working out their own form: Traditional format designations have been retained in the cases of full collations, in spite of the fact that they have lost much of their meaning because of the great variation in the sizes of modern book papers. . . . Detailed description of the contents of the book as it left the hands of the printer, and before it reached the hands of the binder, is substituted for the older style of signature analysis. (p. 11) The serious consideration of such matters is commendable, even though the passage shows some confusion about the meaning of "format" and the purpose of signature collations. Also noteworthy is their degressive principle, with four lengths of entry, despite some further confusion about "firsts": "American firsts, or firsts issued in other countries in cases where no American first exists, are accorded full entry . . . a shorter form of collation has been used for all authorized English and Continental firsts, whether they preceded the American firsts or not." Finally, one respects their effort to define terms, even when the definitions seem vague today: "The use of the word 'state' instead of 'issue' to describe reprintings with only minor variations is helpful and has been adopted here" (p. 12). The Cooper is important for its attention to the rationale of bibliographical description, even if a number of its specific decisions have been outmoded by later discussion. Next, in 1935, appeared Merle Johnson's Mark Twain (a revision of a 1910 work, but essentially a new bibliography) — not an unusual production except in one respect, its detailed examination of various states, especially those produced by type batter (as in the six-page discussion of Huckleberry Finn ). Individual items are difficult to locate (since there are no item numbers or running titles) except through the extremely full index, which is an integral part of the work, providing the only consecutive listing of the reappearance of specific titles. (In its index and style of description, the Mark Twain was parallel to Karl Yost's 1937 Edna St. Vincent Millay , issued by Harpers in an identical binding, to form a brief "series" of bibliographies of Harper authors; Yost was careful in his comments on bindings and on publication and copyright data but was interested only in firsts and confused in his use of "edition.") The year following the Mark Twain , Charles Beecher Hogan published A Bibliography of Edwin Arlington Robinson (Yale, 1936) — supplementing it in PBSA , XXXV (1941), 115-144, with "New Bibliographical Notes," also issued as a separate. The result of prolonged collecting and research, it may be criticized more for its omissions than for its treatment of the details chosen for inclusion; in an article on his experiences as a bibliographer Hogan asserted, "my book was written with the intention of aiding collectors rather than graduate students, and if one is comparing my description in the presence of the book itself, a listing of the book's contents seemed to me to be quite supererogatory" 17 — a point of view which ignores the fact that more information may make possible the detection of previously unsuspected variants and distorts the whole purpose of descriptive bibliography. The sixth of these major bibliographies has received more praise than any of the others: Thomas F. Currier's A Bibliography of John Greenleaf Whittier (1937), which Jacob Blanck in 1942 called "probably the best single-author bibliography ever done in the United States." 18 The work is particularly full in its listing of reprints and later editions, and it belongs in that very small group of bibliographies of this time which paid any attention at all to gatherings (in the form "Sig. [1]-7 in 8's; 8 in 2"). Its weakest feature is the transcription of title pages — one is surprised to see so understanding a bibliographer remark that "there is but one instance . . . where the lining has the slightest significance" (p. 4). The book remains, nevertheless, an example of extremely careful work. In the early 1940's only three bibliographies were in any way distinctive. Despite the fact that Greg's "A Formulary of Collation" 19 had been available long enough to be assimilated, most bibliographers still ignored the basic physical structure of the book and were content with the old formula of size-pagination-contents-binding, or less — as Julian Sawyer's Gertrude Stein (1941), and the even less descriptive Yale catalogue of the same year; Oscar Wegelin's revised 1941 edition of his William Gilmore Simms (giving only transcriptions, pagination, and locations of copies), and A. S. Salley's complementary work (1943) listing the contents; Malcolm Young's "bibliography" of Paul Elmer More (1941), only a checklist; Robert W. Daniel's brief catalogue of Faulkner (1942), which did use quasi-facsimile transcriptions and listed reprints; and George R. Preston's Thomas Wolfe (1943), again with reprints. Of the three major bibliographies, one was another Poe (1940; revised, 1943) 20 — this time by Charles F. Heartman and James R. Canny as part of "Heartman's Historical Series." Although at the opposite pole from Robertson's in point of physical appearance, it was more dependable, revealed thorough checking, and provided a good census of copies (but unfortunately did not make clear which ones had been examined). As its title indicated ( A Bibliography of First Printings ), it did not include overseas editions, a particularly fascinating study in the case of Poe. There were no collations of gatherings, but the authors at least saw that a well-executed bibliography could serve the needs of all, since they specifically aimed their book at "the Poe scholar, the research worker, and to a certain extent the collector and dealer" (p. 11). Also in 1940 Thomas H. Johnson published The Printed Writings of Jonathan Edwards . Its descriptions were brief (the contents paragraph quite sketchily treated), but its approach was significant in several respects: it used "format" correctly and reported format only "when evidence is present" (p. x); it employed Greg's formulary, at least in part (a collation line would read, "Sm 8vo; 18.1 x 11 cm.; π 3 , B-D 4 , [2], ii, 25, [1] p."); it located copies; and it seriously investigated later editions, such as those of the Tract Societies. 21 The following year Jacob Blanck published his Harry Castlemon , Boys' Own Author . If the writer treated was minor, the bibliographical research was not. Blanck's collations were often in words rather than a formula, but the important fact is that gatherings did get mentioned (as "[1]-13 in 8's"), and the rest of the description was equally thorough, with elaborate notes including copyright information and publication prices. This bibliography was dedicated to J. K. Lilly, whose interest in book-collecting was to become increasingly prominent in succeeding years, for it was his generosity that made possible the next landmark in American author-bibliography — the series of four volumes on Indiana writers published by the Indiana Historical Society between 1944 and 1952: Anthony J. and Dorothy R. Russo's James Whitcomb Riley (1944); Dorothy R. Russo's George Ade (1947); Dorothy R. Russo and Thelma L. Sullivan's Booth Tarkington (1949) and Bibliographical Studies of Seven Authors of Crawfordsville , Indiana (1952). 22 All four were handsomely produced by the Lakeside Press (with many collotype illustrations), and all followed the same pattern. For each book there was a title-page transcription (in quasi-facsimile) and paragraphs on collation (formulary collation of gatherings, with measurement of leaves and description of paper), pagination (contents), illustrations, binding, publication date and price, and notes. When the contents of a book had previously appeared in periodicals, full details of original publication were also given (the periodical items were again listed in a later section, without mention of the book, but all the references were brought together in an excellent index). Unfortunately the location of copies examined was not indicated (except in a few unusual instances), and only first "editions" were described (though later ones were listed, and even states of Grosset and Dunlap reprints were sometimes differentiated), with a resulting lack of attention to textual matters. Aside from these reservations, one can agree with F. G. Melcher that "No useful feature of bibliography-making seems to have been omitted." 23 The four volumes form a sustained achievement and without question constitute the finest "series" of author-bibliographies produced in the United States. During these years there were a few more bibliographies of importance, set off against an increasing number of author-checklists. 24 In 1948 the New York Public Library published another in its outstanding series, William M. Gibson and George Arms's William Dean Howells (serialized in the Bulletin in 1946-47). The great amount of material unhappily necessitated not merely an unattractive double-column layout but a severely condensed form of description: the transcription of the title was followed in one paragraph by pagination and size, in the pattern "p. ii + x + 134, 7¼ x 4½ inches" (with no collation of gatherings), contents, end papers, and binding. Later editions were briefly mentioned, but the numbering system — with each book lettered consecutively under its year, as 70A, 70B, etc., for 1870 — was not designed to show relationships between various printings and editions of a single work. 25 Also in 1948 appeared a new version of Vincent Starrett's 1923 Stephen Crane , by Ames W. Williams and Starrett. The thorough rewriting brought the book into line with modern bibliographical practice in many respects (formulary collation, careful listing of contents, use of data from Publishers' Weekly ), so that it is above the level of the average bibliography. The New York Public Library in 1949 published its next bibliography, at the opposite extreme from the Howells in size — Winthrop Wetherbee's Donn Byrne . Its strong points were an equal attention to American and English first printings (with reprints listed) and detailed notes with publication (but not copyright) information; its collations, however, were overly condensed, in the form "12mo (19 x 13 cm.). v, 282 p.," followed by the enumeration of contents (with some transcription) and description of binding. Jack Potter's John Dos Passos (1950), with good formulary collations and occasional discussions of dust-jackets, was vague in noting copies examined ("several dozen copies" of each Doran title) and reporting later printings ("all books went into later printings unless otherwise indicated"). In the same year as the last of the Indiana volumes came Donald C. Gallup's T. S. Eliot (1952), the outgrowth of many years' interest in Eliot as shown by his 1937 Yale catalogue and 1947 checklist. An admirable job, it nevertheless did not discuss textual relationships nor later printings ("Later impressions and editions are generally ignored except where some particular significance attaches to them," p. ix). It has perhaps received most attention for its pagination formula, based on the system of the American Library Association (used on Library of Congress cards), in which printed preliminary pages adding up to the first numbered page need not be specified, nor do final blank versos. Like any carefully defined system, it has the merit of being unambiguous; but it can be cumbersome to use and more difficult to follow than a straightforward record of all pages, with unnumbered ones italicized: compare "xix pp., 1 leaf, 297, [1] pp." with " i-v vi-xix xx-xxii , I 2-297 298 ." (To be sure, the latter method does not show which unnumbered pages are blank, but the contents paragraph serves this function.) In any case, the choice of this method for a scholarly bibliography of an important author has furnished, as I. R. Willison says, "the occasion for a major debate on the essentials of modern bibliography." 26 In the remainder of the 1950's there were four bibliographies of special significance, beginning with the posthumous publication of Thomas F. Currier's Oliver Wendell Holmes (1953), edited by Eleanor M. Tilton for the Bibliographical Society of America. This huge work surpassed the high standard of Currier's Whittier and was especially noteworthy for its use of publishers' files and account books. Its plan was similar to the Whittier , with books and pamphlets (English as well as American firsts) described chronologically and individual poems arranged alphabetically. Gatherings were noted, in words rather than formulas, and paragraphs covered binding, inserted advertisements, impressions, contract, and contents; later English and American (other than Houghton Mifflin) editions were briefly recorded in an appendix. The most noticeable defect (as in the Whittier ) was the inadequate (and inconsistent) transcription of title pages. One may concur with Oscar Cargill in calling the work a "superlative accomplishment" and a "touchstone for the profession" without agreeing that it should be the model in form for future bibliographies of our major authors. 27 Four years later, in 1957, came a two-volume bibliography of James Branch Cabell from the University of Virginia. The first volume, by Frances Joan Brewer, was not distinguished, without quasi-facsimile transcription or any collation except total number of pages, though it was somewhat more detailed on bindings. It is the second volume, by Matthew J. Bruccoli, which makes the bibliography important; entitled Notes on the Cabell Collections at the University of Virginia , it represents the first large-scale application of certain modern bibliographical techniques to the problem of distinguishing impressions in machine-printed books. Each setting of each Cabell book is divided into its constituent impressions, determined by means of collation on the Hinman machine (assuming that textual variants are evidence of a new impression), measurement of gutters, and analysis of type damage. For ease of reference, it is unfortunate that the two volumes of the work could not have been consolidated (particularly in view of the discrepancies that occur, as in the reporting of pagination), but the value of the second volume as a pioneer effort is obvious. In the same year Leon Edel and Dan H. Laurence's bibliography of Henry James was published as the eighth volume in Rupert Hart-Davis's series of "The Soho Bibliographies" (and a revised edition appeared in 1961). The work set a very high standard (with formulary collations and some discussion of the complicated textual problems), and the preface showed that many of the serious difficulties in the description of modern books had been thoughtfully confronted; but one might wish for quasi-facsimile transcriptions (instead of all capitals), fuller treatment of later editions, and a less casual attitude toward the designation of colors. 28 The following year the New York Public Library issued the most elegantly produced of all its distinguished bibliographies, Emily E. F. Skeel's Noah Webster (edited by Edwin H. Carpenter, Jr.), printed in a limited edition by The Thistle Press. The research was done with great care and all later editions duly recorded, but the published form of the descriptions was an unhappy choice: title-page transcription (without line-endings or quasi-facsimile style); pagination — as "119, (1) pp." — measurement, and contents (without signature collation, except where there was no pagination, as on p. 233); location of copies; and notes. 29 Between the time of these bibliographies and the next Soho on an American figure, in 1963, the numerous brief "bibliographies" can simply be listed. When no comment is made, one may assume that, despite the excellent examples of the late 1940's and 1950's, the standard is about the same as in the 1920's, with no formulary collations and minimal notes on contents and bindings: Samuel French Morse's Wallace Stevens (1954; revised and enlarged in 1963 as one of the checklists published by Alan Swallow of Denver); H. D. Rowe's Hart Crane (1955), also published by Swallow; Klaus W. Jonas's Carl Van Vechten (1955), not really descriptive; Frank dell'Isola's Thomas Merton (1956); C. Harvey Gardiner's William Hickling Prescott (1958); Martha Cox's Maxwell Anderson (1958), not intended to be descriptive; Elmer D. Johnson's Thomas Wolfe (1959); W. H. Hutchinson's Eugene Manlove Rhodes (1959); Edgar Branch's James T. Farrell (1959), a checklist only; William White's John Ciardi (1959), W. D. Snodgrass (1960), and Karl Shapiro (1960); Dan H. Laurence's Robert Nathan (1960), which follows Gallup's Eliot in pagination formula; 30 George J. Firmage's E. E. Cummings (1960); Betty Adler and Jane Wilhelm's H. L. Mencken (1961), a thorough checklist; Henry Hardy Heins's Edgar Rice Burroughs (1962; revised, 1964); David Kherdian's William Saroyan (1965), which includes descriptions and (even two illustrations) of dust jackets; Hensley C. Woodbridge, John London, and George H. Tweney's Jack London (1966), the largest of the Talisman Press bibliographies; and the series compiled by Eugene P. Sheehy and Kenneth A. Lohf, including Marianne Moore (1958), Yvor Winters (1959), Frank Norris (1959), and Sherwood Anderson (1960). 31 Three bibliographies stand out from this group because they employ a formulary collation of gatherings: Charles M. Adams's Randall Jarrell (1958); J. M. Edelstein's Thornton Wilder (1959); and Cecil K. Byrd's "Check List of the Melcher Lindsay Collection" ( Indiana University Bookman , December 1960), a praiseworthy job. James B. Meriwether's The Literary Career of William Faulkner (1961), though not strictly a bibliography, is the indispensable bibliographical tool for Faulkner and takes account of the English editions. The eighteenth volume of the Soho series was Donald Gallup's second bibliography of a major modern writer, Ezra Pound (1963), which maintained the high standard he had set in the Eliot ; it employed his special system for recording pagination but did not treat later editions and impressions. In 1964 the University Press of Virginia published another bibliography which used the same analytical techniques as Bruccoli's Cabell : William W. Kelly's Ellen Glasgow , edited by Oliver Steele. All the impressions of each edition were noted, with the evidence for the classification; but the book is not a bibliography in the usual sense because only the distinguishing points are given: "the notes are sufficient to identify any copy of an Ellen Glasgow book printed to date." The aim was to provide a guide for identification rather than a record of the forms of an author's publications. In the editor's words, "although the descriptions are not fully analytical, the notes are the result of a thorough bibliographical analysis." At the end of our survey, then, we have returned to a work superficially like the earlier collector's handbooks, but scholarly in method and intent. It is an analytical study, not a descriptive bibliography; but it has demonstrated some of the tools which must be a part of any future bibliographer's equipment. * * * * * * A glance at the record reveals how much remains to be done before even the principal authors are adequately covered. For the colonial and federal periods, only the Mathers, Edwards, and Webster have been carefully treated, though C. William Miller's work on Franklin is nearing completion. Of the early nineteenth-century writers, Cooper, Irving, and Poe have been provided with usable bibliographies; but among the major mid-century authors — Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman — not a single one has been given a satisfactory account. If Whittier and Holmes have been dealt with handsomely, there is nothing for Bryant, Longfellow, and Lowell. Mark Twain, Howells, Henry James, and Crane have been provided for, but in varying degrees. And in the twentieth century, the vogue of certain writers has produced erratic patterns, whereby there are three bibliographies of Cabell, two of Van Vechten, and even a large volume on Edgar Rice Burroughs; it is perhaps surprising that at least Robinson, Eliot, and Pound have been given something of their due. Minor writers often command devoted attention, and the bibliographies of Riley, Ade, Tarkington, and "Harry Castlemon" have set higher standards than those reached in most works on major figures. No doubt the public reaction to author-bibliographies partly accounts for this state of affairs. They are notoriously bad risks for a publisher, and there is constant pressure to prune each work and reduce the printing costs. Only Houghton Mifflin among major American publishers has ever shown any extended interest in author-bibliographies, although Harpers did begin an informal series with Mark Twain and Millay, and other commercial publishers have occasionally issued bibliographies of their own authors' works. For the most part, however, American author-bibliographies have appeared under the imprints of bookshops (Brick Row, Centaur), libraries (New York Public, Yale), or scholarly (nonprofit) organizations (Indiana Historical Society). The phenomenon of Rupert Hart-Davis is unusual in England, and he has no American counterpart. But the publishers by no means should bear the principal blame for the poor quality of most author-bibliographies: the profession itself is at fault. Bibliographers in university positions continually find that their colleagues have little idea what they are up to; professors of literature concede the necessity for good bibliographies but often give little evidence of knowing how to judge bibliographical work. If their reviews would not call a sketchy bibliography "detailed" or refer condescendingly to a study of "misprints" but instead would enumerate errors and demand a scholarly approach, the general level of bibliographies might gradually rise. But an understanding of the purposes of bibliography cannot be expected in an atmosphere which supports such statements as the following, about Hogan's Robinson : "frankly for collectors rather than scholars, with emphasis upon exact descriptions of editions, bindings, and text, and a minimum of biographical material." 32 There have been, of course, some responsible reviews in the past — one thinks of David Randall's long series for Publishers' Weekly 33 — but there have not been enough. A bibliographer deserves to be faced with the kind of scrutiny offered by James M. Osborn in his well-known review of Hugh Macdonald's Dryden 34 or by James B. Meriwether in his recent review of Frederick Woods's Churchill (which could be taken as a model of the careful checking required). 35 On the other hand, it is easy to abuse bibliographies unfairly, and there are few bibliographies so bad that they are worse than none at all. As the Times comments, "A reviewer . . . is always conscious that the sheer ballast of fact in an author bibliography, however inadequate, will always give it useful substance of a kind that unoriginal history, biography or criticism can never have." 36 And if, as Lawrence Wroth once said of bibliographical analysis, "There are few tasks more exacting, more demanding of sustained reflection and of the exercise of the constructive imagination," 37 then a relatively small number of good bibliographies can be expected. Nevertheless, no valid excuse can be found for haphazard and sloppy work. To quote the Times once more, in its general survey of the Soho bibliographies, the amount and kind of detail in a bibliography may reflect the state of the source material but always reveal "the degree of enthusiasm and understanding which the individual has brought to his task." 38 Though the gradual advance of bibliographical knowledge may alter the particular demands made upon an author-bibliographer, his "understanding," or approach, is the fundamental test. The history of the descriptive bibliography of American authors bears out this point. But it also demonstrates that the less narrow the approach, the more likely that future specialized demands will be met. If past experience is to be instructive, the bibliographer must realize that he cannot ignore anything as irrelevant. Information which seems to him useless can furnish someone else with essential data on book-trade or publishing practice that will, in turn, provide a meaningful context for the original facts. 39 More specifically, this inclusiveness must encompass all later editions and impressions 40 — both details from publishers' records and descriptions of examined copies (often more difficult to locate than "firsts"). An account of textual relationships among these various editions also forms a natural part of the story (twenty-five years ago Osborn was saying in his Dryden review, "The time is not far distant when such a statement will be considered a fundamental responsibility of the scholar-bibliographer"). Quasi-facsimile transcriptions and formulary collations of gatherings are central elements (even for machine-printed books), along with a contents note offering transcriptions of other preliminary pages. And, to mention only one more debatable issue, dust jackets cannot be ignored on the grounds that they are not an integral part of a book; their importance obviously warrants treatment, and they can at least be described, in their various states, as separate entities. It is to be hoped that the bibliographies of the major American authors now being edited 41 can take proper advantage of an unusual opportunity to combine new bibliographical techniques with the accumulated experience of a seventy-five-year-old tradition. In 1934 Percy Muir could say, "The state of modern bibliography is worse than deplorable. It is almost hopeless." 42 One is perhaps not being too optimistic to feel that the present outlook is somewhat brighter.</field>

His Trollope , he went on, "is not only a reference work for collectors of that particular author but also a commentary on the book and publishing crafts of mid-Victorian England" (p. ix). 3 Falconer Madan, "Degressive Bibliography," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , IX (1906-09), 53-65.

Shaw's Carl Sandburg (1948); Carl J. Weber's Jacob Abbott (1948), and Clara C. and Carl J. Weber's Sarah Orne Jewett (1949), with no title-page transcriptions, and notation only of the total number of pages, measurement, and color of cloth; Lucille Adams's Huckleberry Finn (1950), not descriptive at all but with some discussion of bindings; Lee Samuels's A Hemingway Check List (1951); Guy R. Lyle and H. T. Brown's Christopher Morley (1952), supplementing Lee; and Sophie K. Shields's Edwin Markham (1952). 25 This system was called "highly usable" by C. T. Miller in the New England Quarterly , XXI (1948), 558-559, who also commended the "detailed collations" and considered the work "a model for bibliographies of difficult and extensive subjects." Cf. E. F. Walbridge's review in PBSA , XLII (1948), 264-266. 26 Library , 5th ser., VIII (1953), 132-134. 27 PBSA , XLVIII (1954), 100-105. 28 See the review by John S. Van E.

Martin's "The Establishment of the Order of Printings in Books Printed from Plates: Illustrated in Frank Norris' The Octopus ," American Literature , V (1934-35), 17-28. Other lists of these years, which are not — and do not call themselves — bibliographies, have served in the absence of more detailed treatment: catalogues of library exhibits, like Joan Baum and Roland Baughman's L. Frank Baum (Columbia, 1956), or those prepared by John D. Gordan for the New York Public Library and Richard Gimbel for the Yale Library; or checklists of library holdings, like the series from the Barrett Library of the University of Virginia (for example, Bret Harte , 1957; Charles Timothy Brooks , 1960; Edwin Lassetter Bynner , 1961.) 32 New England Quarterly , X (1937), 806-807. 33 See, for example, his remarks on Davis's Wharton (17 June 1933, pp. 1975-76), Langfeld-Blackburn's Irving (18 November 1933, pp. 1757-58), Robertson's Poe (21 April 1934, pp. 1540-43), Johnson's Mark Twain (22 February 1936, pp. 917-918), or Yost's Millay and Clymer-Green's Frost (15 May 1937, pp. 2034-36). — It should be noted here that, because of the general state of bibliography-reviewing, no attempt has been made in this article to list all the reviews; the ones cited represent a sampling of those which are above the average level or unusual in some respect. 34 Modern Philology , XXXIX (1941), 313-319. 35 PBSA , LX (1966), 114-122. 36 Review of Adrian Goldstone and Wesley Sweetser's Arthur Machen , TLS , 17 March 1966, p. 232. 37 Curt F.

One recent statement of it is by R. A. Sayce, who suggests that the knowledge of compositorial practices which can serve to localize the work of unidentified printers might be considerably furthered if additional (and more detailed) elements were included in bibliographical descriptions. See his "Compositorial Practices and the Localization of Printed Books, 1530-1800," Library , 5th ser., XXI (1966), 45. This more inclusive approach does not, of course, absolve the bibliographer from the chore of arranging material into meaningful (or suggestive) patterns. 40 There has been an increasing awareness of the importance of English editions of American writers, from the time of I. R. Brussel's Anglo-American First Editions (1936) to Roland L. Shodean's "English Editions of American Authors 1801-1863" (Master's thesis, University of Chicago, 1958) and the recent paper, "Transatlantic Texts," read by Matthew J. Bruccoli to the Bibliographical Society (15 March 1966). Such work as Clarence Gohdes's "A Checklist of Volumes by Longfellow Published in the British Isles During the Nineteenth Century," in Bulletin of Bibliography , XVII (1940), 46ff., will be a great help to the future Longfellow bibliographer, but there has been very little research along these lines. 41 When the Centennial Edition of Sidney Lanier was being prepared — and for many years it was the only scholarly collected edition of an American author — provision was made for a "bibliography" (by Philip Graham and Frieda C. Thies, in VI [1945], 379-412), but it was only a checklist, with no description. 42 "Bibliographies Reviewed," Points : Second Series (1934), p. 42. Fifteen years later Bowers referred to the "usual case" against modern bibliography: "it is still in the semi-enumerative stage masquerading as descriptive in the hands of untrained writers" ( Principles , p. 361).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Poe and "Young America" by Claude Richard</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Edgar Allan Poe moved to New York in April 1844, there is no doubt that he was pursuing his life-long dream of launching a first-class magazine — one which would, at last, be under his sole control. His many frantic attempts to bring this recurrent dream to life bear testimony to his dissatisfaction with his previous activities as a critic whether in Richmond under the authority of Thomas W. White, or in Philadelphia where William Burton's expediency and George Graham's namby-pambiness had come to "disgust" him. In Philadelphia, however, competition was tough and though the "Stylus," as he had decided to call the magazine he was planning, was to strike a radically different note, the odds were against success in a contest with the popular Godey's Lady's Book cleverly edited by Mrs. Sarah Josepha Hale and Graham's Magazine which had succeded in appealing, thanks largely to Poe's own contributions, both to a sentimental female audience and to the more exacting patronage of lawyers and wealthy gentlemen. New York offered better opportunities than the conservative old capital for a thoroughly original magazine with high intellectual ambitions. Poe also realised that money was more likely to turn up in New York than in Philadephia. He needed a backer but failed to find one: instead he found a friend, Evert A. Duyckinck, the head of the so-called "Young Americans," who in Arthur H. Quinn's words "provided what Poe needed, an adviser and a manager." 1 The best known result of the friendship with Duyckinck was the publication as No. 2 of Wiley and Putnam's "Library of American Books" of Poe's Tales in June 1845 and his The Raven and Other Poems in November 1845. While commentators, influenced by Poe's objections to the selection 2 have blamed Duyckinck for the omission of "Ligeia" and other masterpieces, it might be more profitable to consider the problem from the publisher's and the editor's point of view and wonder why Wiley and Putnam took the obvious risk of publishing Poe's tales at all. The copyright of every book in the series was assigned to the author (Poe was to get eight cents for each copy sold) which implied the publication of books that might safely be surmised to sell in reasonably large quantities. Such was not the case with Poe's Tales , despite the fact that his popularity had soared after the much discussed newspaper publication of "The Raven" in January, 1845. The collection included no new material, all of the tales having previously appeared in widely circulated magazines. 3 The name of Poe was less popular with the reading public than most of the names that were to appear in the series (J. T. Headley, William Gilmore Simms, Cornelius Mathews, etc.). Moreover, tales, as Carey, the Philadelphia publisher, once wrote John P. Kennedy, sold poorly when the public demand was for huge novels. 4 Duyckinck, who evidently was given full liberty by the firm and could select whatever title he pleased, was aware of these difficulties. Why, then, did he choose to publish the tales of an outsider to New York and to his own group with every chance that the publication would be a financial failure? His choice is puzzling. Friendliness alone cannot account for such conspicuous favor from the leader of the "Young Americans" and the editor of a series of literary works avowedly intended to serve the cause of American letters. Here in fact lies the core of the matter. Duyckinck was the enthusiastic proponent of a truly national literature with a democratic appeal, and he had preached his gospel with unmistakable fervor for more than five years. He had created the Tetractys Club whose program was to serve the promotion of a truly American literature; he had projected the establishment of the Home Critic — the name speaks for itself —; he had launched, with his friend Cornelius Mathews, the devoutly national Arcturus and even after its failure had risen to prominence in New York as the defender of a new, independent literature — a literature which, in contrast with the more aristocratic and European works of such writers as Longfellow and Washington Irving, would strike a truly national note likely to win the average uncultured American to the habit of reading and initiate him to the moral profits of art. So far he shared nothing in common with Poe, except his scorn or rather utter misunderstanding of transcendentalism. But for a rather florid paragraph written ten years before at the outset of his career as a critic, 5 Poe was anything but a champion of a national literature. He had handled Duyckinck's nearest allies, Cornelius Mathews and William A. Jones, 6 rather roughly and he was nothing of a Democrat: he had "battled with right good will for Harrison" and he considered his "principles" to "have always been as nearly as may be, with the existing administration" (Tyler's) ( Letters , I, 170). He had steadily denounced the degrading influence of the idea of nationality on American criticism 7 and American taste. 8 Finally, no casuistry could so misrepresent the truth of Poe's tales as to regard them as specifically American, redolent of native life and expressing the genius of the American people, in the manner of Simms's The Wigwam and the Cabin or Mathews' Big Abel and the Little Manhattan . 9 Some other link must exist between Poe and the Young Americans, some alliance which would explain the "quixotic" favors bestowed upon Poe by the editor of "The Library of American Books." The proof of Poe's allegiance to "Young America" is glaringly written in an article in the Broadway Journal (July 19, 1845) that has somehow escaped previous notice. 10 The brief paragraph is entitled "Young America" and runs thus: "Regretting the necessity of employing the phrase which is not only borrowed, but redolent of affectation, we still have the most earnest sympathy in all the hopes, and the firmest faith in the capabilities of 'Young America.' We look upon its interests as our own, and shall uniformly uphold them in this Journal. What these interests are — what should be the aspirations of the new men in the country, and of the country through them in particular, it has been our intention to express fully in our own words, at the first convenient opportunity — but we have now lying before us an address which embodies all that there is any necessity for saying. "We allude to a paper read by Mr. Cornelius Mathews at the late annual meeting of the Eucleian Society of the University of New York. We shall be pardoned for making some extracts." 11 The excerpts from Mathews' highflown address cover two columns in small type and contain such frantically nationalistic statements as the following: "I therefore, in behalf of this Young America of ours, insist on nationality and true Americanism in the books this country furnishes to itself and to the world: nationality in its purest, highest, broadest sense" (pp. 26-27). The printing of large extracts from Mathews' address is enough to prove Poe's goodwill towards "Young America" and his gratitude towards Duyckinck. The tenor of the introductory passage is complex: it is both a profession of faith ("we look upon its interests as our own") and, as Poe's New York audience must have at once perceived, a declaration of war. In pledging that his magazine would serve the interests of Young Americans, Poe was renouncing the middle-of-the-road policy he and his co-editor Charles Frederick Briggs, who was sympathetic to the Knickerbocker group, had maintained at the Broadway Journal . By the end of June, Poe, after "a series of manoeuvres almost incomprehensible to [himself]" ( Letters , I, 299), had managed to get rid of Briggs who would soon find refuge in the Sanctum; Poe wastes no time in proclaiming to which side he belongs: the statement, under the editorial "we," coming not long after the announcement that he is now sole literary editor, is clear enough. The ousting of Briggs and Poe's consequent freedom brought about the final break that had been threatening for some time: on the one hand we have the Knickerbocker group, closely allied by links of kinship and political identity to Colton's American (Whig) Review , with the help of Briggs's bitingly satirical pen; on the other, the Democratic set led by Duyckinck and Mathews in O'Sullivan's Democratic Review , helped by the even more caustic pen of the editor of the Broadway Journal . Thus, until the final collapse of the Broadway Journal , Poe's criticism is manifestly partisan: it either bestows fervid praise on the Young Americans and every title in "The library of choice reading," 12 eagerly puffing William G. Simms 13 who had joined the Democratic set, 14 or casts sharp barbs at whoever appears to belong to the other camp. Thus if we find Poe advocating the Young American movement in his first period of critical independence, would it not be logical to expect to find covert or overt advocacy of that movement in his earlier critical writings? His advocacies of these ideas will date from a period after his initial contact with the conspicuous members of the Democratic set. Poe had much to win, for Duyckinck's protection was as effective as the protection of an eighteenth century patron. Who could reproach any half-starving young critic with a dying wife for forcing and somewhat colouring in brighter hues some of his opinions? Who would doubt Poe might yield to such temptation? The first indication of relationship between Poe and any member of "Young America" is the arresting letter he sent to Cornelius Mathews on March 15, 1844. Surprisingly enough Poe accuses himself of flippancy, a reproach he often chafted under and makes light of the matter: "Could I imagine that, at any moment, you regarded a certain impudent and flippant critique as more than a matter to be laughed at, I would proffer an apology on the spot." The touchy and haughty pride which was his customary attitude is stifled under the painfully elaborate protestations of "the Highest Respect &amp; Esteem" ( Letters , I, 245). It was not Poe's habit to apologize for his mordant reviews. The following remark sums up his habitual attitude: "If I must call it a good book to preserve the friendship of Prof. Ingraham — Prof. Ingraham may go to the devil" ( Letters , I, 71). Moreover the "impudent and flippant critique" he mentions was a thorough study of Mathews' poem "Wakondah," covering thirteen pages and including, among other compliments, the following conclusion: "We should be delighted to proceed — but how? to applaud — but what? Surely not this trumpery declamation, this maudlin sentiment, this metaphor run mad, this twaddling verbiage, this halting and doggerel rhythm, this unintelligible rant and cant" ( Works , XI, 25-38). Poe had already clearly stated his disagreement with Mathews' critical attitudes, particularly in an untitled paragraph in Graham's Magazine . This article, later called "Exordium" by Poe's editors, 15 is written in answer to the nationalistic manifestoes of the Young Americans which had appeared in Arcturus . Besides, he had repeatedly upheld the point of view that the whole controversy about a national literature had led the too exclusively nationalistic critics into the worst excesses; they had gone even so far as to pervert the taste of the American public by puffing such "trash" as the selfsame "Wakondah" ( Works , XI, 26). The sudden shift, so far unexplained, is, to say the least, troubling. I am well aware that long before he had anything to do with any of the members of Young America, Poe professed some opinions that fitted very well with the new orthodoxy of the literary democrats. This partial identity, his need of a backer for his magazine and the natural tendency of the foes of Lewis Gaylord Clark to unite are not enough to account for such blatant rejection of his previous opinions. The previously undiscovered fact that will help us to understand Poe's motives in writing this disturbing letter and will eventually shed light on some of his major reviews is that his letter is a response to another. Mathews' letter, if extant, has not, to my knowledge, been located, but an excerpt from a letter quoted by Poe in Graham's Magazine for January 1844 points to an early correspondence between the two men. In January 1844, Poe announces a forthcoming review of R. H. Horne's epic poem Orion . 16 With his usual journalistic shrewdness he hints the book has been sent directly from England and quotes from "a letter now lying before us," intimating that the letter also comes from England: "A rush of buyers . . . almost carried the publisher off his feet. The public fell into an especial ecstasy, and bought the poetry in its sleep — a thing it very seldom does awake — and now the poet [R. H. Horne] brings out his fourth edition for a shilling (which the public buys too because it is not yet wide awake) and promises a fifth for half a crown in a few days." Poe's biographers, assuming that this letter had been sent to the poet, have concluded that it was probably lost. I have however been able to find the source of the extract quoted above in a letter from Elizabeth B. Barrett to Cornelius Mathews. 17 Miss Barrett was a close friend of Mathews' who had first introduced her to the American public. 18 Because Mathews had acted the part of an American literary agent with great effectiveness, she believed him to be powerful with editors and publishers and enquired whether he could be of any help to her professional friend Horne. On April 28, 1843 she offered Mathews some of Horne's poems for publication in "Graham's Miscellany." 19 Mathews must have taken the affair in hand and Graham must have agreed for on July 3, 1843 she mentions two copies of Orion she proposes to send — "one for Graham's Miscellany" (p. 52). This letter contains the paragraph quoted verbatim by Poe about the original publication of the poem. Thus it is evident that Mathews forwarded to Graham's office both the poem and probably a copy or an extract of Miss Barrett's letter. Poe, however, was no longer the editor of Graham's Magazine and contributed only occasional reviews. It may thus be assumed either that he received the book for review from Mathews, or that Graham handed it over to him along with the letter. In both cases Poe must have known that Mathews was the "importer" and sponsor of the poem which he planned to publish in America. Poe wastes no time in advertising it, inserting a brief but highly commendatory paragraph even before having perused it attentively: ". . . as yet . . . we . . . have had opportunity to glance at individual passages," letting naïvely slip the confession that: "We must read and review 'Orion.'" In spite of that "the work . . . is, beyond doubt, that of a man of genius." 20 Two months later — Poe seems to be waiting for something as he seldom delayed so long between the announcement of a review and the review itself — appears the glowing tribute to Horne's poem. 21 This enthusiastic review is generally considered as one of the most conspicuous lapses in Poe's critical judgement. It is actually disturbing for not one of the poem's features meets Poe's standards in spite of which the reviewer declares that "'Orion' has never been excelled. Indeed we feel strongly tempted to say it has never been equaled" (p. 266) and concludes that "'Orion' will be admitted, by every man of genius, to be one of the noblest, if not the very noblest poetical work of the age" (p. 275). Poe's unaccountable enthusiasm is disturbing because he bestows praise on a long, didactic, ethical, allegorical epic, thus apparently overlooking his clearest previous dicta that a true poem is short, unconcerned with either truth or ethics and spurning above all else allegory. Although Poe acknowledges that "Mr. Horne, . . . is, in some measure, infected" (p. 254) by the "cant of the day" (p. 253), transcendentalism, an element the critic could never force himself to commend, although he acknowledges that Horne "has been badgered into the attempt at commingling the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth" and "has weakly yielded his own poetic sentiment of the poetic — yielded it, in some degree, to the pertinacious opinion, and talk, of a certain junto by which he is surrounded," yet, he opines that Horne is ". . . unquestionably . . . a man of high, of the highest genius . . ." (p. 254). One must note at once that Emerson had so far been simply ignored by Poe, precisely because he indulged in the "cant of the day" and Longfellow fails to elicit from Poe the label of genius for one sole reason: he insists on commingling "the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth." Overlooking these disparities between Horne's practise and his own critical tenets, Poe proceeds to define once again what he now calls "pure poetry" (p. 256). Leaning on his usual examples — Coleridge's theory of passion and poetry, Tennyson's "Locksley Hall," "Oenone" and "Morte d'Arthur," Cousin's ideality — he evolves one of his most fruitful definitions of the origins of poetry as "the thirst for a wilder beauty than earth supplies" and of poetry as "the imperfect effort to quench this immortal thirst by novel combinations of beautiful forms . . ."; concluding after an approval of Coleridge's rejection of even love from poetry that "Truth is, in its own essence, sublime — but her loftiest sublimity, as derived from man's clouded and erratic reason, is valueless — is pulseless — is utterly ineffective when brought into comparison with the unerring sense of which we speak" (pp. 256-57). This is Poe at his best, but the definition has nothing to do with Horne's work which is confessedly a poem with a moral, that is to say, in Poe's special vocabulary, concerned with Truth. The next paragraph shows Poe at his worst. He now dedicates all his logical powers to the vindication of Horne's shortcomings so that the poem may seem to meet his own critical standards: "In setting about 'Orion', Mr. Horne proposed to himself, (in accordance with the views of his junto) to 'elaborate a morality' — he ostensibly proposed this to himself — for, in the depth of his heart, we know that he wished all juntos and all moralities in Erebus. In accordance with the notions of his set, however, he felt a species of shamefacedness in not making the enforcement of some certain dogmas or doctrines (questionable or unquestionable) about PROGRESS, the obvious or apparent object of his poem" (p. 257). "Orion" is allegorical but so obscurely so that it shows ". . . conclusively that the heart of the poet was not with it" (p. 258). As for the narrative, it ". . . is beautiful indeed," but ". . . we have only to object that the really magnificent abilities of Mr. Horne might have been better employed in an entirely original conception" (p. 259). The whole structure of the poem evinces an "uncertainty of purpose which is the chief defect of the work" (p. 261), a meek remark from the pen of the most thorough theoretician of Unity, who will harshly condemn The Iliad and Paradise Lost on the same ground. 22 After an unusually short catalogue of the grammatical and metrical errors, a point upon which Poe might have been expected, in his usual fashion, to dwell at greater length, he simply dismisses those shortcomings as "mere inadvertences" (p. 265) (an exceptionally lenient opinion). He then proceeds in his usual manner to analyse "the beauties of this most remarkable poem" (p. 266), making his point clear without further delay: "it is our deliberate opinion that, in all that regards the loftiest and holiest attributes of the true Poetry, 'Orion' has never been excelled" (p. 266). The following pages teem with indications that, though candidly admiring such or such passage, 23 Poe is at a loss to grasp and convey the elements of beauty of the poem: characteristically, he resorts to high-flown style when attempting to impart the specific quality of the only virtue he can point out: "Its imagination — that quality which is all in all — is of the most refined — the most elevating — the most august character" (p. 266). Then follow the usual apologies he offers whenever anything baffles his analytical powers. Such sentences as: "And here we deeply regret that the necessary limits of this review will prevent us from entering, at length, into specification" (p. 266-67), or, "we conclude with some brief quotations at random, which we shall not pause to classify" (p. 273) are patent confessions of powerlessness, whatever its cause. The general impression therefore is that Poe is ill at ease, that he carefully avoids speaking of the poem at all for almost half of the article and then apologizes for having no space left for anything but a cursory review, 24 that he refrains from listing the many obvious stylistic and metrical flaws of the poem and is as heedless as to quote and italicize for commendation an obviously lame line: Or, casting back the hammer heads till they choked The water's course, enjoy, if so he wished, Midnight tremendous, silence, and iron sleep. 25 The final flourish, so unlike his more candid assertions of enthusiasm reinforces the impression that Poe is not at ease. Now if we recall the date of the letter sent to Mathews we cannot but be struck by a coincidence and we may perhaps re-read the first paragraph: the "small parcel for Mr. Horne" is evidently the review, with Poe's tale, "The Spectacles" he hopes to publish in England through Horne. Under the pretence of asking for Horne's address, Poe lets Mathews know that the mission he has been entrusted with — the writing of a favorable review of "Orion" — has been carried out, that he himself Poe has done the job 26 and the apologies that follow are consequently less bluntly humble than we might at first have thought. They are not the words of a poor artist begging for protection but the last concession of one of the parties towards a compromise. To Poe it was important that Mathews should know the review was his, because Poe, it would appear, had contracted to review the poem, perhaps for payment, perhaps in return for some good offices he expected from Mathews who had written to Horne that "there would be a review," 27 perhaps because he was Mathews' "debtor for many little attentions" as he acknowledged in his letter of March 15, 1844 (I, 245). Thus Poe seems to have striven to show his good will towards Young America as early as the last days of 1843. The obvious question is therefore what advantage he could derive from such alliance. In addition to the facts that it was common talk Duyckinck was planning to launch a new magazine and was the only New York patron that could be of any help to Poe, another coincidence may explain Poe's tokens of good will. It is well-known that he meant to issue a collection of his tales but that no publisher would run the risk of publishing them. 28 In March 1844 a new and entirely original publishing project had been advertised: the Home Library , the history of which it is perhaps not useless to sketch out. On August 23, 1843, Duyckinck, Mathews, William Cullen Bryant and other less conspicuous figures had founded a club whose program was "to procure the enactment of such law or laws as shall place the literary relations of the United States and foreign countries, in reference to copyright, on just, proper, and equitable grounds." 29 Poe's interest in the issue of international copyrights is well-known and any American author, particularly a professional one, must have followed closely the evolution of the enterprise and read the statement, signed by Bryant, Francis L. Hawks and Mathews, of October 18, 1843. It stressed the necessity of a collection "at a price which will satisfy the just demands of the author, and the rightful expectations of the reader." 30 In the winter of 1843-44 Poe could not but be cognizant of the activities of Duyckinck, Bryant and Mathews that would lead to the publication of a prospectus of the Home Library in the New York Tribune dated March 30, 1844. This new publishing venture had been widely advertised and must have been known to Poe on March 15, when he wrote to Mathews since the prospectus advertised the first volume of the series as ". . . now ready at all the book stores and periodical agencies . . ." Friendship with Mathews and Duyckinck would be particularly helpful since they were in charge of a collection whose plan was to include "COPYRIGHT WORK OF AMERICAN AUTHORS, and new works of English writers, to be published by mutual arrangement with them and for their benefit." 31 The Home Library was a failure and only two volumes were published: Bryant's The White Footed Deer and Headley's Italy and the Italians , a name that would later appear as No. 3 in Duyckinck's "Library of American Books." Number two would be Poe's Tales . When one reconsiders Poe's critical reviews during the span of time from the propitiatory letter to Mathews to the statement of alliance with Young America in the Broadway Journal of July 19, 1845, one cannot fail to notice that the great majority of his themes tally with the dearest opinions of the Democratic set. Both his themes and his new tastes in literature suggest either Duyckinck's influence or Poe's attempts to gain recognition as a reliable Young American. With more energy than ever, he harps upon the themes of the financial hardships of the truly American writer, 32 of the devastating subserviency of American critics to English opinions, 33 on the artificiality of modern plays plagued by imitation of the old models, 34 on the urgent need for an international Copyright law, 35 on the necessity of a new, modern magazine-literature, 36 more adapted to a rapidly increasing reading public. That democratic public he observed was not concerned with the leisurely, cultivated essay in the English style of Lamb, that the Knickerbocker set's favorites, John Waters [Henry Cary], George Templeton Strong, and Rufus Dawes, (three "gentlemen of elegant leisure," an anti-democratic conception), were trying to impose as the genuine literature of America. One of these themes, imitation in literature, lay at the core of Young America's campaign for a truly original literature. 37 It should be noticed that, contrary to what has been held, Poe fought the first skirmish in the too famous "Longfellow war" under the banner of Young America. The so-called war that was to degenerate and lead Poe to utter some of his most preposterous statements, originated in two reviews of Longfellow's Waif published in the New York Evening Mirror on January 13, and January 14, 1845. 38 In the concluding paragraph that roused such anger, Poe took issue with Longfellow for "a very careful avoidance of all American poets who may be supposed especially to interfere with the claims of Mr. Longfellow: These men Mr. Longfellow can continuously imitate (is that the word?) and yet never even incidentally commend." 39 The only American poets who could have interfered with Longfellow's claims were, apart from Poe himself, the democratic-minded ones who strove to refresh American poetry by a more genuinely American style than the erudite Professor was able to achieve. The most active were Cornelius Mathews with his pregnant theme of the American Indian and a young, ardent romanticist, who was then seeking inspiration in the popular traditions of his country and, though he would later defect to the enemy, was an early friend and favorite of Duyckinck's: James R. Lowell. 40 Against which of the titans of American poetry ought an aggressive critic who desired to curry Duyckinck's favor launch his weapons? Against Longfellow, of course, whose popularity threatened the advent of the American "Master genius . . . who would automatically be greater than Shakespeare." 41 As significant as both Poe's insistence on those themes and his attacks on Aldrich and Longfellow are the many favorable allusions to once despised Young Americans with which he sprinkled many of his articles. His treatment of William Gilmore Simms is particularly illuminating: in November 1844, Poe is given access to the columns of the fortress of the Democrats, the Democratic Review . He is probably short of matter, for these first two Marginalia are largely made up of reprints and adaptations of his earlier reviews. These reprints however are not selected at random: one of the adaptations is particularly interesting. It concerns William G. Simms, the latest recruit of the Young Americans. Poe had had frequent opportunities to express his opinions of Simms: he had reviewed The Partisan , 42 The Damsel of Darien , 43 and had included Simms in his Autography sketches. 44 These reviews were very unfavorable, the review of the Partisan scathingly so. But in 1844, Simms is a Young American: consequently, though he kept the good joke about the "poetical gaping oyster," Poe is careful to select the most favorable passages in his previous articles and to "edit them": he extracts the only two favorable remarks he had made and prints them as two separate items. 45 To the sentence reading: "Mr. Simms has abundant faults," he now adds the very ingratiating corrective note "or had." Then to a once unfavorable passage he added the following sentence: ". . . leaving out the question of Brockden Brown and Hawthorne, he is immeasurably the best writer of fiction in America." Six months later, in the Broadway Journal , the sentence has been finally adapted thus: ". . . the best novelist that this country has, upon the whole, produced." 46 As compared to Poe's absolute frankness about his allegiance to Young America in the second half of 1845 and to his downright puffery of Young Americans, 47 those incidental compliments tend to suggest that, as late as January 1845, Poe had not come "under the wing" of Duyckinck, but was striving to obtain his protection. Distrust on Duyckinck's part was natural enough since Poe had never given any incontestable proof of faithfulness. But, in January 1845, thanks to Lowell's introducing him to Charles F. Briggs, Poe was given free access to the columns of the Broadway Journal : his very first contribution was a thorough review of Elisabeth Barrett's [Browning] The Drama of Exile and Other Poems 48 which, when considered in the light of Poe's relationship with Mathews and Duyckinck is revealing. All Poe's critics consider the article to be favorable. Echoes of Poe's great admiration for Miss Barrett crop up regularly. 49 How can we account for the critic's concluding many dense column inches of harsh exacting criticism with the judgement that Miss Barrett "has done more, in poetry, than any woman, living or dead . . ." and "has surpassed all her poetical contemporaries of either sex (with a single exception) [Tennyson]" ( Works , XII, 32)? There is an obvious gap between the harshly critical comments upon individual poems on the one hand and the glowingly enthusiastic conclusion on the other. Once again, Poe is ill at ease: the rigorously logical approach that is customary with him dissolves into mere wordiness. To any one familiar with Poe's chivalric sense of what a gentleman's behavior towards women should be, the opening quotation is a warning: "'A WELL-BRED man,' says Sir James Puckle, in his 'Gray Cap for a Green Head,' 'will never give himself the liberty to speak ill of women'" (p. 1). At the very outset of the review Poe seems to state that whatever the faults of the poetess's poem, a gentlemanly critic will offer a favorable conclusion. Then, in spite of his many previous statements that a review is nothing but a discussion of the work considered, he devotes two pages to an examination of what he regards as the excesses of other American comments upon The Drama of Exile and Other Poems . Regretting that the "limits of this 'Journal' will preclude the possibility of [his] speaking this truth [about Miss Barrett] so fully, and so much in detail, as [he] could wish" (p. 3), he starts a hardly necessary discussion of the weaknesses of the Greek drama, in which he makes use of material written three years before ( Works , X, 201), checking his sources rather carelessly and attributing Oedipus at Colonos to Aeschylus. Next comes a thorough and brilliant examination of Miss Barrett's errors: the drawing of Eve's character is feeble; ". . . she is a mystical something or nothing, enwrapped in a fog of rhapsody about Transfiguration, and the Seed and the Bruising of the Heel, or rather talk of a nature that no man ever pretended to understand in plain prose, and which, when solar-microscoped into poetry 'upon the model of the Greek Drama,' is about as convincing as the Egyptian Lectures of Mr. Silk Buckingham . . ." ( Works , XII, 4-5). The whole tone is transcendental and ". . . in nine cases out of ten, the thought, when dug out, will be found very poorly to repay the labor of the digging" (p. 5); which allows Poe to insert a contrastingly vigorous, though unconnected paragraph about the justified use of obscurity in the creation of the fantastic. The "Drama of Exile" "opens with a very palpable bull" (p. 6) — a long, turgid, self-contradictory stage direction — whose obvious awkwardness Poe minutely discusses in thirty lines. His apologies for "alluding to these niaiseries at all" is that they allow him to put "in the clearest light the mass of inconsistency and antagonism in which her subject has inextricably involved her" (p. 7). The plot receives no better treatment: ". . . it is something even worse than incongruity which affronts: — a continuous mystical train of ill-fitting and exaggerated allegory — if, indeed, allegory is not much too respectable a term for it" (p. 8). Poe's delightful satirical verve here betrays his sincerity: "Innumerable other spirits discourse successively after the same fashion, each ending every stanza of his lamentation with the 'yet I wail!' When at length they have fairly made an end, Eve touches Adam upon the elbow, and hazards, also, the profound and pathetic observation — 'Lo, Adam, they wail!' — which is nothing more than the simple truth — for they do — and God deliver us from such wailing again!" (p. 9). The "Drama of Exile" is then merely dismissed in strong plain words: "It is our purpose, however, to demonstrate what every reader of these volumes will have readily seen self-demonstrated — the utter indefensibility of the 'Drama of Exile', considered uniquely as a work of art" (p. 9). After quoting one eighteen-line extract for commendation, Poe insists that it is ". . . the longest quotable passage in the drama, not disfigured with blemishes of importance," which leads him to the conclusion that ". . . neither are there, in any of her poems, any long commendable paragraphs nor are there any individual compositions which will bear the slightest examination as consistent art-products" (p. 10), for Poe, the most damning of all judgments; yet, he follows immediately with an utter non sequitur, the observation that she is ". . . unhesitatingly, the greatest — the most glorious of her sex" (p. 11). To the didacticism of the "Vision of Poets," he, of course, objects, but grants the poem to be "thoughtful, vivid, epigrammatic and abundant in just observation" (p. 12). He had always counted one of these, epigrammaticism, the most perilous pitfall of short poems. Thoughtfulness, vividness and justness of observation are critical clichés he had always been wary to avoid. With obvious relief he now turns to the opinions of a "reviewer in Blackwood's Magazine" and devotes two full pages to the minute and tedious corrections of Christopher North's misconstruing of three unimportant quotations. Then he gets rid of the twenty sonnets and nineteen remaining poems in two or three sentences containing such statements as: "In general, the themes are obtrusively metaphysical, or didactic" (p. 14). A week later he continues in the same vein: after a brief favorable analysis of "The Cry of the Human" and "Lady Geraldine's Courtship," ending with a delicate hint — for Poe, a very delicate hint — that the latter contains borrowings from Tennyson's "Locksley Hall," Poe manages a noncommittal defense of Miss Barrett by a schoolmaster analysis of what he knows best: Professor Wilson's blunders in his review of the collection of poems. Having picked out a line Wilson had selected "for special animadversion" he studies it exhaustively to show that ". . . from the entire range of poetical literature there shall not, in a century, be produced a more sonorous — a more vigorous verse — a juster — a nobler — a more ideal — a more magnificent — . . ." (pp. 18-19) and passes on to a surprisingly long, accurate and justified listing of all her shortcomings: the language is affected, though the quaintness of some phrases is duly commended and worked into a defense of Poe's own belief in the virtues of old-fashioned oddity; the imagery is occasionally farfetched "which is reprehensible in the extreme" (p. 21), sometimes verging on ". . . nonsense, and nothing more," sometimes "repulsive" (p. 22); knotty paradoxes, platitudes, synecdoches, inartistical and undecorous conceptions are duly listed; repetitions, mannerisms are "multitudinous" (p. 25), and we are given a complete list of the "pet-words," "down" and "to lean," though her grammar is unexceptionable and her style, in Poe's limited meaning, ". . . exceedingly chaste, vigorous and comprehensive . . ." (p. 27). In his strictures upon her inattention to rhythm he does not mean "the multiplicity of inadmissible rhymes," though he gives twenty-seven examples, so much as the metrical deficiencies that make the ". . . metre . . . intended . . . nearly impossible to determine . . . in some cases . . ." (p. 27). The double rhymes have no special value; breaks are forced after the fourth trochee, the division of the poem into quatrains serves no prosodic purpose. Poe obviously enjoys himself, indulges gleefully in metrical games, printing a quatrain in a new typographical disposition to bring out in relief the artificiality of the seven-foot line, then printing another one in prose to call attention to the deficiency of the foot pattern. He had never been more accurate, more thorough and more convincing. But he now "make[s] an end of [his] fault-finding" and turns to the "beauties" of the book (p. 29). As he puts it: "Alas! here, indeed, we feel the impotence of the pen" (p. 29). His clear-cut sentences dwindle into blurred rhetoric: "We have already said that the supreme excellence of the poetess whose work we review, is made up of the multitudinous sums of lofty merits" (p. 29). He painfully succeeds in quoting four isolated specimens worthy of admiration: "an example of keen insight into our psychal nature" — "an instance of the purest and most radiant imagination" — "a specimen of wild Dantesque vigor in combination with pathos never excelled" — "a passage embodying the most elevated sentiment most tersely and musically expressed" but confesses his powerlessness to account for the value of the book and "to the book, then, with implicit confidence [he] appeal[s]" (pp. 30-31). Psychological insight in poetry he had never before associated with the loftiest order of poetry; imagination, he is accustomed to qualify by more accurate adjectives than either "pure," by which he means unspoilt by didacticism, a reproach he has insistently levelled at Miss Barrett throughout the review, or "radiant," an "indefinite" word hovering in his mind at the time, better suited to the "indefinitiveness" of poetical suggestion than accurate critical analysis; "wild Dantesque vigor" is a reminiscence of Mathews' review of the poems of Miss Barrett in the Democratic Review 50 that Poe had evidently read, since he mentions it twice in his own review. Still, to the utter bewilderment of the attentive reader he goes on to say it "will scarcely be questioned . . . that Miss Barrett has done more in poetry, than any woman, living or dead" (p. 32). What she had done in poetry is less than evident in the very critical comments in the preceding pages. And Poe is aware that it is not evident in these pages as we can see in his protestation that ". . . that she has surpassed all her poetical contemporaries of either sex (with an exception) [Tennyson] is our deliberate opinion — not idly entertained, we think, nor founded on any visionary basis" (p. 32). Thus, out of thirty-two pages, Poe is able to devote only two, largely made up of extracts, to the analysis of the truly poetic essence of the work under review and his praise has been shown to be clumsy, patently half-hearted and unnaturally high-flown, at times even bombastic. And when he undertakes, in the concluding paragraph, to trace Miss Barrett's affiliation to her English predecessors, the contrast between the deep insight into Shelley's and Tennyson's creative processes and the flat unsupported statements of Miss Barrett's genius leaves a durable impression of unconvincing exaggeration of the merits of the poetess, the more so as close examination of the final arguments reveals they contain a contradiction and are partly adapted from Horne's paragraph on Miss Barrett in the New Spirit of the Age . 51 The sincere admiration Poe shows for some of E. B. Barrett's poetic qualities in the body of the article would hardly lead us to expect the unbridled enthusiasm of the last paragraph. He is manifestly puzzled by this "mystic" poetry, at a loss to express his complex feelings. He resorts to easy schoolmaster's criticism, betraying as he goes along, his utter powerlessness at accounting for the enthusiasm he professes to show. In spite of what is generally assumed, he had never so far taken interest in E. B. Barrett's poetry, though it was already widely circulated. He had mentioned her once only 52 as a contributer to R. H. Horne's Chaucer Modernized ( Works , XI, 250). Besides why should he write a review, so long after the publication of the work 53 that he feels compelled to apologize for the delay ( Works , XII, 3)? In January 1845, he badly wanted money and may have swelled the article to get an extra dollar a page (Quinn, p. 452). He may have wanted to please Graham, in whose magazine most of Miss Barrett's poetry had appeared and was still appearing and whose editor, Griswold, was begging for reviews of The Drama of Exile and Other Poems . 54 He may have tried, as he did with Horne, to gain Miss Barrett's gratitude with a view to her helping to introduce his tales in England. Both, however, the circumstances of the American publication of The Drama of Exile and Other Poems , and some obscure allusions in the review, suggest Poe's desire to please the Young Americans. It is not perhaps uninteresting to recall that the fame of Miss Barrett in the United States had been the result of the "wonderful" 55 exertions of Cornelius Mathews. The prospectus of the Home Library issued on March 30, 1844, 56 mentioned among the works intended for publication in the poetical series, "A new Volume of poems by E. B. Barrett of England" (Good-speed, p. 113) that "of course" was "to be secured through the good offices of Mathews" (p. 116). Mathews' correspondence with Miss Barrett had already put them on a friendly footing. The first criticism of her works ever to appear in the United States appeared in Arcturus for February 1841. It is by Evert A. Duyckinck. The highly laudatory review was the keynote of the campaign of laudation the Young American followers of Duyckinck were to conduct on Miss Barrett's behalf. They prided themselves on having "discovered" her and they were indeed gratified when the prestigious North American Review followed their lead and published a commendatory review of her poetry. But Mathews had already "staked his claim" to E. B. Barrett: in December 1841 the two editors of Arcturus had forwarded the volume containing Duyckinck's review with word that her verse would be "heartily received by the lovers of poetry in America." 57 In July 1842, the delighted Miss Barrett sent four sonnets and "The Cry of the Human." They arrived too late to save Arcturus which had collapsed in May 1842. Cornelius Mathews then took the matter in hand: he sold "The Cry of the Human" to Nathan Hale Junior, in whose Boston Miscellany for November 1842 58 it appeared not far from Poe's review of Griswold's "American Poetry" (pp. 218-221). The four sonnets were sent to Philadelphia where they appeared in Graham's Magazine for December 1842. 59 In the "Editor's Table" of the same issue (p. 343) Graham printed an enthusiastic notice after the following paragraph: "Miss Barrett — In this number will be found a series of sonnets by Elizabeth B. Barrett, among the first of her contributions to any American periodical. They were originally intended for 'Arcturus,' to which magazine they were sent: but arriving after the discontinuance of that periodical, its editors placed them at our disposal, 'thinking the good company into which they would be introduced in 'Graham' would be every way agreeable to the fair authoress.'" Thus Poe, who still lived in Philadelphia and occasionally contributed to Graham's Magazine , was very likely to have read this notice, to have learned that Miss Barrett was the protegée of the Young Americans and to have gathered from the raving tone of the puff that the literary man who wanted to curry the favor of Young Americans would be well advised to treat Miss Barrett with cordiality. 60 Moved by Mathews' tokens of kindness, Miss Barrett promised a volume of her poems: "Whenever I print another volume you shall have it, if Messrs. Wiley and Putnam will convey it to you," 61 and wished every kind of success to ". . . the Society of Help in New York of which you are secretary." 62 Then, in March and July, she sent her most heartful thanks for the troubles he had taken on her behalf in making arrangements with H. G. Langley for an American Edition of her Poems , 1844 . 63 She was to get "ten per cent of the net proceeds of the sales" 64 and the edition would come out simultaneously with the English publication to avoid piracy. 65 She is fully aware of the extraordinary favor bestowed upon her by an American publisher 66 who could have got her poems or any novel by Dickens or Walter Scott for nothing within days after the publication of the English edition. 67 She is explicit in acknowledging her debt to Mathews and Mathews only. 68 H. G. Langley was, of course, the publisher of the Democratic Review . Miss Barrett's instant popularity constituted a demonstration of the critical acuity of the Young Americans who had discovered her. She had been hailed in England, accepted by the North American Review , but now her name was inextricably linked to Young America: prepublication of the "Drama of Exile" appeared in the Democratic Review for July and August 1844 together with two sonnets in August and September 69 and two highly laudatory articles in July and October 1844. 70 Again and again, in her letters, she dwells on that "wonderful" kindness and urges Mathews not to sacrifice his "critical faculty" to his "interest in [her] (proved in so many ways)." 71 By the end of the year the Poems, 1844 had received almost unanimous praise in England and America. By that time, since Miss Barrett acknowledged her association with Young America in the preface to the American edition of her book where she speaks kindly of her American editor, Mathews, Young Americans were able to use her fame as the most incontestable proof of their critical acumen. They cleverly organised her publicity, 72 for her fame bore such indisputable testimony of the superiority of their critical insight over any other critical school — the Knickerbocker's in particular. To Poe, the newcomer, this was a convenient occasion to show his sympathy at a particularly opportune period when the plan for the "Library of American Books" was under way. Prudence was required, however, for the gossiping busybody of the world of literati, Poe's old enemy, Lewis Gaylord Clark, lay in wait, hoping to catch Poe contradicting himself. Briggs, however, was at this time not utterly opposed to Young America and was willing to go so far as to accept a very favorable article on that staunch Young American, William A. Jones, by Dyckinck. 73 Hence he would not refuse an apparently very objective one about Young America's protegée, the more so as the article, whether he noticed it or not, was peppered with cryptic allusions. First, Poe did not fail to remark that the edition was an "American edition," emphasizing the phrase by quotation marks though he had already noticed that the American edition of Miss Barrett's works is "published under the superintendence of an American author" ( Works , XII, 2), a sentence that had been made conspicuous by Duyckinck's note in his article in the American Review (I [January 1845], 38); the allusion in Poe's review is an obvious commendation of the achievements of the gentlemen of the Copyright Club and of their secretary, Cornelius Mathews, the self-same "American author." In examining American opinions of Miss Barrett, Poe mentions that the only critique evincing any degree of objectivity — this can hardly be a coincidence — is that of the Democratic Review , Mathews', of course. On the contrary, the most flattering article to appear, one which is so dithyrambic that it is "an insult well intended" ( Works , XII, 2), had been published in the Journal of the foes: the newly born American Review . This, however, may have been a blunder which, I believe, suggests that Poe was not yet an acknowledged member of the group let into all the secrets, that he was a newcomer not yet quite cognizant of the subtle intricacies in the pattern of alliances on New York stage: as we have seen, the unsigned article he disparaged was by Duyckinck. Who on earth, familiar with Duyckinck's "true blue" Democratic trends, would expect the leader of Young America to be given access to the first number of a magazine that contained in its announcement to the public a violent diatribe against the Democratic Party, that "other great political division . . . essentially anarchical in its principles and tendencies." 74 The announcement flatly stated the aim of the new review was to ". . . support freely and openly the principles and measures of the Whig Party . . ." (p. 3) and exploded Duyckinck's pet idea, a truly new national literature, in these words: "we are a people eager for novelty: we care more for the newness of a thing than for its authority. This is a trait which . . . has an unfavorable influence upon us in many respects . . . It especially affects, what must have all these [morals — philosophy — speculative belief — regular formation of national customs — characters] for a partial foundation — the growth of our national literature. For, if tastes may change and customs be laid aside with the hour, and opinions be held no longer than they are able to excite, and faith be considered a matter of choice, it is obvious that our literature must be forever unsubstantial and fugitive" (p. 4). The paragraph amounted to a manifesto meant to counterbalance the pernicious influence of all Young America's jabbering about the rejection of models as the first step toward attaining a national literature. There were some facts that Poe, still rather green for the "literary butcher-shop" was unaware of: Colton's personal friendship with Duyckinck, their tacit agreement that an anonymous article of a different trend in a professedly partisan journal could not fail to brighten up the reputation for fairness of the magazine and attract uncommitted readers. More precisely still, Poe was too much of an outsider both to New York and to the Young Americans to realize how fast political commitments may shift and that a temporary truce has just been made between such broadminded Whigs as Colton (who naïvely hoped to keep politics apart from literature) and such undoctrinaire Democrats as Duyckinck because they both disapproved of the annexation of Texas and of the war with Mexico, and both supported the notion of protection by an international copyright. "Hence," in Perry Miller's words, "in New York many Whigs found that they could be friendly with 'loco-foco' Democrats like Duyckinck. . .." 75 This typical New York rapprochement, Poe, the provincial American in New York, grasped after some delay. There were however in Poe's review enough tokens of good will to atone for the blunders: the typographical errors were charged to the English edition, Poe assimilated himself to the "friends" of Miss Barrett; the exposition of the pernicious influence of the imitation of the ancient drama was a faithful echo of Mathews' campaign for a truly American Drama rejecting models of any kind. The assertion that the modern public at large was able to think and judge, an idea quite unlike Poe's conception of a pyramid-shaped society in which adequate judgement is transmitted down the scales to the "rabble" (one of his favorite words that had strangely disappeared from his vocabulary at the time) must ring pleasantly in Duyckinck's ears. Winding up the whole with another allusion to the critic in the Democratic Review ( Works , XII, 16), regular insertions of flat statements of Miss Barrett's supreme, though unanalysed, genius, Poe had managed to say his word about that poetry without obscuring his real meaning. For, as early as February 1, praise poured on Poe from Young American quarters. Of course, Poe's article was unsigned. How did then Poe manage to let Young Americans know of his authorship? First, we must note that in style it was unmistakably his and that Lowell identified the author at first glance. 76 Then one must recall that January and February 1845 were precisely the two months when Duyckinck and Briggs were on most friendly terms. 77 Moreover, on January 11, again, the very date of the second instalment of Poe's review of Miss Barrett, the New York Weekly News published an estimate of the Broadway Journal indicating Poe as the author of the review: ". . . Miss Barrett (rather painfully to us) is put to the question by Mr. Poe with his usual critical acumen and force of style." 78 The editor of the New York Weekly News was O'Sullivan, Duyckinck's old friend and ally, and Duyckinck held an unofficial position on the board of editors of the New York Weekly News . Finally, on February 1, 1845 came Duyckinck's recognition of Poe in terms of the warmest commendation: Graham's Magazine for February is illustrated by a portrait of Edgar A. Poe, with an accompanying biography by Lowell. We cordially give a welcome to this distinct recognition of Mr. Poe's merits. Whenever his name is mentioned it has been with the comment that he is a remarkable man, a man of genius. Few knew precisely what he had written, his name was not on Library catalogues or any of his books on the shelves. His influence has been felt while the man was unknown. Lowell's article removes the anonymous and exhibits the author of some of the most peculiar and characteristic productions in our literature. 79 It seems therefore that this puzzling review has puzzled everyone but the man for whom it was intended: E. A. Duyckinck. Such recognition, presented so objectively and so thoroughly, of Young America's Egeria by the harshest critic in the United States was really ingratiating. The other person involved, Miss Barrett herself, was astonished and provided the best commentaries. Her official answer, sent to Poe through Horne, is generally quoted: it is interesting to notice that the ordinarily glib and easy letter writer is unsettled to the point of writing twice to Horne on the same day: "You will certainly think me mad, dear Mr. Horne, for treading upon my own heels [illegible] in another letter. But I am uncomfortable about my message to Mr. Poe, lest it should not be grateful enough in the sound of it." 80 Her first reaction had been to consider the review unfavorable — which it was — her sure instinct having told her that the strictures ring far truer than the praises. But her commentaries to her personal friends, in her more natural mischievous manner are more revealing. To Horne a few hours before the letter quoted above she had written: "Your friend, Mr. Poe, is a speaker of strong words 'in both kinds' . . . But Mr. Poe seems to me in a great mist on the subject of meter." 81 To Robert Browning she wrote on December 1, 1845: "He [Poe] wrote a review of me — the two extremes of laudation and reprehension, folded in on one another. You would have thought that it had been written by a friend and foe, each stark mad with love and hate, and writing the alternate paragraphs — a most curious production indeed." Of course she felt something odd in this rabid admiration so clumsily supported by such harsh strictures. But when she heard of the dedication of The Raven and Other Poems , she was utterly bewildered. Because Poe's attitude was more ambiguous than ever: "And think of Mr. Poe, with that great Roman justice of his (if not rather American!) dedicating a book to one and abusing one in the preface of the same." 82 It seems as if he had, for some reason or other, to give public testimony of his esteem for her but tried at the same time to convey his real meaning. The surprise is that when we turn to the preface of The Raven and Other Poems , we find no derogatory opinion of Miss Barrett, not a word about her or anybody else. She too was surprised when she received the book — so much so that she considered the very improbable possibility that the copy under her eyes had been specially printed for her own use: "I have just received Mr. Edgar Poe's book — and I see that the deteriorating preface which was to have saved me from the vanity-fever produceable by the dedication is cut down and away — perhaps in this particular copy only." 83 What had happened? Of course, it was Mathews himself who had sent her the news. On December 3, 1845 she wrote to him: "You amuse me when you say that Mr. Poe has dedicated a book to me and abused me in the preface of it." 84 There are only two possibilities: either Mathews had lied, or he or someone else had prevailed upon Poe to cut out the unfavorable remarks on Miss Barrett. In this literary milieu where the value of puffery was unquestioned, it was obviously in Mathews' interest to try and erase those unfavorable sentences, since he was planning to reprint Miss Barrett's Prose Miscellanies 85 and looked to Poe for help in promoting them. Thus if Mathews' hint is no downright lie (and what possible reason for lying could be he have had?), there may exist an unknown draft of Poe's preface to his The Raven and Other Poems and the very publication of the book may be the result of an arrangement with the Young Americans. May we venture to surmise that Duyckinck, though willing to publish Poe's poems, 86 imposed or suggested the dedication as a condition; that Poe half-heartedly accepted but attempted to make his opinion clear in the preface; and that he was finally prevailed upon by Mathews to cross out any allusions to Miss Barrett with the idea they might harm the sale of his forthcoming reprint of the Prose Miscellanies ? Two facts support this surmise: as everyone knows Poe argues in a note prefixed to the "Poems Written in Youth" included in the same edition that "Private reasons — some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism, and others to the date of Tennyson's first poems — have induced me to re-publish these, the crude composition of my earliest childhood" ( Works , VII, xlix). The note is an attempt to exculpate himself from the accusation of plagiarism from Tennyson. 87 But there had also been rumors of his borrowing some details for "The Raven" from Miss Barrett's "Lady Geraldine's Courtship." 88 How like Poe it would have been to exonerate himself of the charge of having plagiarized her poem by taking her to task in the preface of the first printing of "The Raven" in a collection of his poems. This was probably the theme of those unfavorable remarks hinted at by Mathews. Moreover, close examination of Poe's later criticism reveals that, once his poems were published, with their most humble and enthusiastic dedication, Poe lost all interest in Miss Barrett. 89 Her name often appeared in Poe's later criticism but not once does he qualify or reconsider his previous opinions. He plunders his own article and either reprints verbatim or "edits" his excerpts from his own review to fit them into a new reasoning but never further than replacing the editorial "we" by "I," changing a few conjunctions or omitting a word or phrase. 90 Again his glowing respect for her does not prevent him from "editing" her letter of thanks in a much more significant manner and of using it as a puff. She wrote: "After which [the foregoing] imperfect acknowledgement of my personal obligation may I thank you as another reader would thank you for this vivid writing, this power which is felt! Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a 'fit horror,' here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by the nevermore . . . I think you will like to be told that our great poet, Mr. Browning, the author of 'Paracelsus' and the 'Bells and Pomegranates' was much struck by the rhythm of that poem." 91 To Joseph M. Field, editor of the Saint Louis Reveille he sent, with request to insert "editorially" under the title: "The British literary journals are admitting Mr. Poe's merits, in the most unequivocal manner" the following adaptation: "The world's greatest poetess, Elizabeth Barrett Barrett , says of Mr. Poe: — 'This vivid writing; — this power which is felt! 'The Raven' has produced a sensation — a 'fit horror' — here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the yias [sic] of it and some by the music — but all are taken. I hear of persons absolutely haunted by the 'Nevermore' . . . Our great poet, Mr. Browning, the author of 'Paracelsus,' 'The Pomegranates' etc. is enthusiastic in his admiration of the rhythm" ( Letters , II, 319-20). He sent the same "edited" text to P. P. Cooke, with a request to print it in Cooke's notice on Poe as an extract from a British magazine. 92 The first reaction of the Democratic papers to the Barrett review was dubious; as we have seen, O'Sullivan in the New York Weekly News deemed it "rather painful" for his taste and the New York Morning News for January 14, 1845 carried a lukewarm estimate of Poe's review. Poe believed the notice to have been by Duyckinck and was scared. He hurried to print a corrective note for the enlightenment of Duyckinck which brings additional proof that the latter's opinion was what Poe really cared for: "We observe, in a notice of the Broadway Journal , a new aspirant for public favor, that Mr. D. speaks of a review of Miss Barrett's Poems as if it were condemnatory. We should be sorry indeed, if any general disparagement were intended of the most extraordinary woman of her age — perhaps of any age. Our impression, however, is that the critic of the Broadway Journal meant only, by a few unimportant objections, to place her pre-eminent merits in the best light. But perhaps this is Mr. D's impression also, and we have misconceived him." 93 Evert A. Duyckinck loathed puffery as much as Poe himself (though he made an exception for his bosom-friend, Mathews) and admired above all the dignity of the dauntless critic who was not afraid of speaking out the truth however harmful to himself. To him, the review, apparently by a great admirer of Miss Barrett lucid enough to point out her weaknesses, must have appeared as the archetype of critical honesty. He may have said so to his obedient troops and allies for after his own glowing recognition of Poe's genius in the Weekly News for February 1, 1845, the chorus of Young Americans sang the praises of Poe and the Broadway Journal . 94 Moreover three journals whose editors were friends of Duyckinck's, opened their columns to Poe's poems and tales; the American Review published "The Raven" in its February number, 95 "Some Words with a Mummy" and "The Valley of Unrest" in April, "Eulalie" in July, "The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar" in December; O'Sullivan ( New York Morning News ) reprinted "The Raven" on February 3, 1845, "The Purloined Letter" on January 21 and 24, and "The Oval Portrait" on May 1. 96 He also reprinted "The Raven" and the two tales in the Weekly News on February 8, January 25 and May 30, 1845. 97 By March 15, 1845, W. G. Simms, having come to understand that Poe had been adopted, hastened to congratulate Duyckinck. 98 In February Poe had smashed to pieces Rochietti's "Why a national literature cannot flourish in the United States." 99 At last, on March 8, when Nathaniel P. Willis's authority was no longer a hindrance and Poe's new position as associate editor of the Broadway Journal allowed him to state clearly his allegiance, he made haste to publish a sort of manifesto in a letter "To the editor of the Broadway Journal." Down with the blind critics who ruin American letters by their incompetence or dishonesty — this is the tenor of the paragraph — down with the indiscriminate pretended friends of National literature and hail to "the Willises — the O'Sullivans — the Duyckincks — to the choice and magnamimous few . . ." 100 that have supported him and whose aim is so similar to his. The paragraph being a letter to the editor is exceptionally signed E. A. P. Is the presence of the most ardent locofocos in this short list of the savers of American literature fortuitous? In all likelihood, February 1845 saw the sealing of Poe's alliance with Young America. In June 1845, the Tales , edited by Duyckinck, appeared. On June 26, the Broadway Journal was about to collapse: Poe offered it for sale to Duyckinck or Mathews ( Letters , I, 290). "Or, if this cannot be effected, might I venture to ask for an advance of $50 on the faith of the 'American Parnassus'?" Duyckinck lent fifty dollars and saved the Broadway Journal . 101 On July 19, Poe published his "profession of faith" in the Broadway Journal and from now onwards systematically puffed anything by Duyckinck, J. T. Headley, Mathews and Simms, as well as all the numbers of the "Library of Choice Reading" and the "Library of American Books." 102 In the New York and Boston magazines for 1845 and 1846, there is ample proof that Poe was universally considered as a staunch Young American: Lewis Gaylord Clark often referred to him as a member of the "Mutual Admiration Society"; 103 in a review of "Simms's Stories and Reviews" printed in the North American Review for October 1846, C. C. Felton disposed of Poe in one sentence along with Cornelius Mathews, J. T. Headley and other Young Americans: "The Tales by Edgar A. Poe and the lucubrations of Mr. J. T. Headly, the former belonging to the forcible-feeble and the shallow-profound school . . ., are poor enough materials for an American Library." 104 Another proof of Poe's association with Young America is provided by Charles F. Briggs in his hilarious description of the literary party he included in his satire on New York life: The Trippings of Tom Pepper (1847-50). It is interesting to note that Austin Wicks (Edgar A. Poe) arrives at the party in the company of Mr. Ferocious (Cornelius Mathews) and Mr. Tribbings (Evert A. Duyckinck): they are the best friends in the world. Poe is then presented as the mouthpiece of Young America and the hero of Mr. Tribbings until he drinks one glass of wine and quarrels with Ferocious whom he calls an ass (I, 162). Since the instalment including the literary party appeared in the New York Mirror on February 27, 1847, it is reasonable to conclude that the final break between Poe and the Young Americans took place towards the fall of 1846. This dating is confirmed by Poe's strictures on Young Americans in his unpublished manuscript on 'The living writers of America' which can be safely dated to the second half of 1846. In fact from the end of 1846 onward, Poe was to deny all those favorable opinions of Young Americans and to deal frankly and devastatingly with Mathews, Headley and Simms. 105 Moreover, in his manuscript notes for his great critical work on 'The living writers of America,' he adopted Lewis Gaylord Clark's derogatory phrase whenever he referred to Young America: "want of centralisation gives birth to a peculiar cliquism whose separate penchants render it nearly impossible to get at the truth . . . The M[utual] AD[miration] Society Mathews, Duyckinck, Jones, Cheever etc once — now reduced to Mathews and Duyckinck." 106 More significantly, he completely rejected the idea of nationality in letters and clearly named Duyckinck and Mathews as its proponents: "What is a true nationality — the cant of the M[utual] A[miratio]n Society ab[ou]t it — there should be no nationality . . . Nationality means according to Mathews, toadying Americans and abusing foreigners right or wrong. . . ." After Griswold had made Poe's opinion of Duyckinck's selection of the Tales appear to have been hostile to the point of insult, Duyckinck struck back with his well known charge that Poe was "a literary attorney, who pleaded according to his fee" (Quinn, p. 677); there was perhaps more truth in his opinion than is generally assumed. Thus most of the glaring contradictions or erratic judgements in Poe's critical work belong to the period when he strove to please Duyckinck, the final outcome being that those contradictory statements are not so much the proof of a muddled mind as a reflection of the hardships of an artist's life in the 1840's when literature and criticism were still for so many Americans, the domain of "gentlemen of elegant leisure." The explanation of such contradictions or erratic reviews will finally illuminate the great consistency of Poe's critical output, which is not necessarily a point in his favor; such explanations may help to show that the precepts laid down by the very young poet in 1831 in the "Letter to Mr. ____ ____" continued to dominate the critical thought of the mature writer. That writer applied those precepts with more unswerving and unqualified rigor than is generally thought. The complexity of motives, aesthetic, economic and personal which lay behind Poe's critical pronouncements throughout his career are nowhere better exemplified than in the record of his years in New York. His years in Baltimore, Richmond and Philadelphia, however, remain to be examined in detail before critics can reach reliable conclusions about which of his reviews deserve to be taken seriously as revealing his genuine convictions on literary questions and which are to be dismissed as insincere or frivolous. Only after such a study has been made shall we be able to assess the worth of Poe's accomplishment as critic with accuracy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Arthur H. Quinn, Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography (1941), p. 476. 2 Cf. Poe's letter to Philip P. Cooke (August 9, 1846) and Poe's letter to George Eveleth (December 15, 1846) in The Letters of Edgar Allan Poe , ed. John W. Ostrom (1948), II, 328, 332. (Hereafter referred to as Letters ). Perry Miller ( The Raven and the Whale 1956) states that Poe ". . . circulated reports that the selection was made 'by a gentleman whose taste does not coincide with mine.'" (p. 135). The words "circulated reports" are not quite accurate as Poe's unfavorable comments on Duyckinck's selection — which the latter was to hear of only after Poe's death — appear in two private letters addressed to correspondents foreign to the world of the literati. Miller's remark that ". . . again in character, Poe had given Duyckinck carte blanche to select the poems" (p. 135), misses the mark since Poe's comments had not been written until August 9, 1846, more than six months after the publication of The Raven and Other Poems . (Poe's published opinion of the selection, a short anonymous paragraph in the Broadway Journal for July 12, 1845 [II, 10], is non-committal). There is moreover proof that Poe himself was responsible for the selection of the poems (cf. Poe's letter to Duyckinck, September 10, 1845. Letters , I, 297). Thus, there is no indication of a quarrel between Poe and Duyckinck prior to August 9, 1846. 3 For a list of the first publication of the twelve tales, see: Charles F. Heartman and James R.

Our limits have constrained us to treat it in an imperfect and cursory manner. We have had to content ourselves chiefly with assertion, when our original purpose was to demonstrate." ( Works , XI, 274-275). 25 Works , XI, 271. The three lines quoted above are the concluding lines of the passage Poe considers to be superior to the description of the Hell in Paradise Lost . 26 The review is anonymous. 27 Cf.

On February 8, 1845, Poe bluntly accused the "gentlemen of elegant leisure" of jeopardizing the future of American Democracy among " the people " by disseminating "the monarchical and aristocratical sentiment" of foreign books. ("Pay of American Authors," New York Weekly Mirror , I, 280). It is the most puzzling opinion ever expressed by the author of "Some Words of a Mummy" and other bitter diatribes against democracy. 40 Longfellow's friend remarked in his letter to the Editor of the New York Mirror : "It has been asked why Lowell was neglected in this collection" (quoted in Works , XII, 42). 41 The Raven and the Whale , p. 115. 42 Works , VIII, 143-158. 43 Works , X, 49-56. 44 Works , XV, 168. 45 Works , XVI, 41 and 59-60. 46 Broadway Journal , II (October 4, 1845), 190. 47 See, in particular: "Headley's Letters from Italy," Broadway Journal , II (August 9, 1845), 75; "Mathews' Big Abel and the Little Manhattan," ibid. , II (September 27 and October 18, 1845), 177-178 and 227, revised and expanded in Godey's Lady's Book , XXXI (November 1845), 218-219 ( Works , XIII, 73-78); "Simms's The Wigwam and the Cabin," Broadway Journal , II (October 4, 1845), 190-191, revised and expanded in Godey's Lady's Book , XXXI (December 1845), 41-43, ( Works , XIII, 93-97); "Mathews' Americanism," Broadway Journal , II (November 29, 1845), 322. 48 Broadway Journal , I (January 4 and 11, 1845), 4-8 and 17-20.

In an article that is not easily available, J.G. Varner offers a more precise story of their relationship. He is, however, more concerned with Miss Barrett's reactions than with Poe's ambiguous attitude. ( Four Arts , [Richmond], January-February 1935, pp. 4-5, 14-15 and 17.) 50 Both Mathews and Duyckinck had compared some passages in Miss Barrett's poems to Dante. See Democratic Review , new series, XV (October 1844), 375, and American Review , I (January 1845), 47. 51 Works , XII, 34-35, and R. H. Horne, The New Spirit of the Age (New York, 1845), p. 267. 52 The two enthusiastic paragraphs in the New York Evening Mirror (October 8 and November 7, 1844) often quoted by Poe's biographers have been proved to be by N. P. Willis (William D. Hull, "A Canon of the Critical Works of Edgar Allan Poe," University of Virginia, unpublished dissertation, pp. 414 and 434. 53 The collection had been extensively reviewed and even Mathews refused to review once again the poems of his protégée.

There was first genuine mutual admiration and almost immediate sympathy between them; but, from the very outset it is evident that Mathews expected Miss Barrett to promote his own poems in England (MS. letters of Cornelius Mathews to Elisabeth Barrett Barrett in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York). 61 The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning , ed.

David Bonnell Green, "Elizabeth Barrett and R. Shelton Mackenzie," Studies in Bibliography , XIV (1961), 247. 67 Carey, the Philadelphia publisher who planned to reprint The Drama of Exile and Other Poems after the usual fashion, gave up his project when he learned that ". . . the New York publisher had proof sheets direct from the author" ( Letters, ed. Kenyon, I, 177). Of course he had been persuaded to abandon his project by Mathews himself: "Carey and Hart, bookseller, at Philadelphia, had announced to publish your Poems, but on my writing, they relinquish the purpose in favor of a publisher who allows you copy money." (MS. letter from Cornelius Mathews to Elisabeth B. Barrett, June 27, 1844, in the Pierpont Morgan Library, quoted by permission of the trustees). 68 See The Collector, V (January 1892), 76 and (February 1892), 89. 69 The following poems by Miss Barrett appeared in the Democratic Review : "A Drama of Exile," New Series XV (July 1844), 74-88, and (August 1844), 142-152; "Work," (September 1844), 249; "Insufficiency," (August 1844), 194. 70 An announcement followed by a long quotation from Richard H. Horne, Democratic Review , New Series XV (July 1844), 72-73; a long review by Mathews (October 1844), 370-377. That Mathews is the author of the review is proved by his statement in a letter to Griswold that: "I have already said my 'say' of Miss Barrett's poems in the Democratic Review for October . . ." (October 28, 1844, in Griswold's Letters , p. 161). 71 See, e.g., Letters , ed. Kenyon, I, 198 and 214. 72 Duyckinck wrote a laudatory review of the collection for the first number of the apparently hostile American Review , I (January 1845), 38-48. He is identified as the author by Mathews' letter to Griswold of October 28, 1844 from which I have already quoted (cf. Note 70): ". . . and Duyckinck has said his ['say' of Miss Barrett's poems] in the New [American] Whig Review." Though the first number of the American Review bore the date of January 1845, it was advertised to be issued in September 1844, was delayed and was finally published late in October ( American Review , I, fly-leaf). Thus Poe who had read the article, which he mentioned twice in his review of Miss Barrett's poems, had learned, if he did not know before, that Mathews was the American editor of the book. To the statement that Miss Barrett's work had been published "under the care of an American author," Duyckinck had convinced the editor, Colton, to append the following note: "Mr. Mathews, to whom Miss Barrett pays a delicate compliment in her preface, and whose volume of Poems she pronounces in another part of her volume as remarkable in thought and manner, for a vital sinewy vigor, as the right arm of the Pathfinder." American Review , I (January 1845), 38. The Democratic papers carry, of course, favorable reviews of Miss Barrett's poems and reprint some of her poems; see, e.g., the New York Morning News, "Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett — From the Last Westminster Review ," (January 25 and 30, 1845); "Opinions of the Press on the Drama of Exile," (January 30 and February 1, 1845); the New York Weekly News , "The Lady's Yes," and "Sleeping and Watching" (January 11 and 25, 1845). 73 Perry Miller ( The Raven and the Whale , p. 127) identifies Duyckinck as the author of this biographical sketch of Jones (signed D.) that appeared in the Broadway Journal , I (January 11, 1845), 26-28. 74 American Review , I (January 1845), 2. 75 The Raven and the Whale , p. 122. 76 "The article about Miss Barrett is extremely well written, I suppose by Poe." Letter to Charles F. Briggs, January 16, 1845, in Woodberry, The Life of Edgar Allan Poe (1909), II, 368. 77 In his Broadway Journal article on William Jones (see note 73), Duyckinck proves that he reads Poe's criticism with interest by inserting the following sentence: "But with all this there was . . . no trace of what Mr. Poe calls American cribbage." Additional proof that Duyckinck had seen Poe's article and, perhaps, censured some of his opinions is to be found in a letter from Briggs to Duyckinck (December 27, 1844): "I enclose you a few lines of a review of your Miss Barrett, which will appear in the first number of my journal [The Broadway Journal , of course] in which I find an Expression that may seem harsh to you. . . . It is meant well I know, from the writer's feelings towards you, but I cannot find him to ask him to substitute something in the place of it which will Express his meaning as well. If you don't approve of the sentence, have the goodness to say so and I will erase it altogether." (Duyckinck Collection, New York Public Library. Quoted by permission.) 78 New York Weekly News , I (January 11, 1845), 1. 79 Ibid. , I (February 1, 1845), 2. 80 Elizabeth Barrett to Horne (May 12, 1845) quoted in Woodberry, II, 119-120. 81 Edgar Allan Poe, A Criticism, with Remarks on the Morals and Religion of Shelley and Leigh Hunt (1919), p. 6. 82 The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett (1899), I, 307. 83 Ibid. , I, 384. 84 The Collector , V (March 1892), 107. 85 On December 30, 1845, Miss Barrett wrote to Mathews: "As to the proposition about the prose miscellanies, I could not but be gratified by it, but I wish you to understand that I should be averse from the re-issue of the Athaeneum papers without a complete course of rewriting." ( Collector , V [March 1892], 107). Considering that she apologised at great length for having failed to answer Mathews' letter earlier and as she explained in the same letter that the delay was due to her many activities permitted by the fair weather of the summer, it is quite safe to conclude that Mathews' proposition had been made long before the publication of The Raven and Other Poems (November 19, 1845), in fact probably while the project, that was mysteriously delayed (see, Works , XIII, 31), was under way. 86 The Tales , mainly ratiocinative ones, though not a success, had sold reasonably well. 87 The accusation can be found in an article entitled "The Poets of America" in the Foreign Quarterly Review for January 1844 (XXXII, 291-324) which Poe believed to be by Dickens though it was probably by John Foster. (See Sidney P. Moss, Poe's Literary Battles [1963], pp. 157-158). 88 These rumors were voiced by his friend Thomas Dunn English in his Aristidean , I (November 1845), 400. 89 Chivers' testimony of Poe's admiration for Elizabeth B. Barrett is unreliable, as are most of Chivers' co-called "Conversations": he only sums up, in Poe's own words, the last paragraph of Poe's review. (See Richard Beale Davis, ed., Chivers' Life of Poe [1952], p. 40.) 90 Compare: Works , XII, 10 and XVI, 135-136 ( Southern Literary Messenger , XV [April 1849], 218); Works , XII, 20-21 and XVI, 159-160 ( Southern Literary Messenger , XV [May 1848], 246); Works , XII, 16 and XIV, 182 ( Graham's Magazine , XXXIV [June 1849], 363); Works , XII, 23-24 and XIII, 200-202 ( Graham's Magazine , XXXVI [January 1850], 50-51). The two short incidental remarks on Miss Barrett in the Broadway Journal , I, 235 and II, 392 go no farther than repeating that she is "unquestionably, in spite of her numerous faults, the most glorious woman of her age" ( Broadway Journal , I, 235). 91 Quoted in Woodberry, II, 164. 92 Letters , II, 329 (omitting only the sentence, "but all are taken"). To Duyckinck, however, who was likely to remember Miss Barrett's letter, Poe sent the original MS. on December 30, 1846, no doubt as a reminder of his past services ( Letters , II, 336). 93 New York Evening Mirror , January 17, 1845. 94 Duyckinck's paragraph about Poe, in the New York Weekly News for February 1, 1845, is not mere puffery (it was apparently written before he intended to publish Poe's Tales ). In two or three sentences Duyckinck attempts to give some accurate analysis of Poe's genius. After February 1, the New York Weekly News is peppered with favorable allusions to Poe (I, [May 31], 2; I [May 17], 1; I [July 5], 2), announcements of his forthcoming books (I [February 15], 2; I [March 15], 4; I [March 22], 2; II [December 6], 1); the New York Morning News carried a very favorable review of the Tales on June 28, 1845 (reprinted in the Weekly News for July 5) and friendly comments on the Broadway Journal on June 24. (The Morning and Weekly News also occasionally reprinted some of Poe's critiques from the Broadway Journal .) Briggs must have been horrified when he read in the New York Weekly News for May 17 (p. 1) this judgment on the Broadway Journal reprinted from the London Critic : "The aim of the Broadway Journal is to encourage a Home Literature to the utmost extent. . . ." From his strategic hideout at the American Review , Duyckinck contributed a highly commendatory review of the Tales in September 1845 (II, 306-309). 95 "The Raven" was published anonymously, though it seems that George Hooker Colton, the editor of the American Review , knew who was the author. In the same February issue of the American Review , Duyckinck published his moving appeal to union among American writers under the title of "The Literary Prospects of 1845." The publication of "The Raven," recommended by Colton's friend, Augustus Shea, may be the first indication of Colton's wish for union (for the sake of American literature) between Whigs and Democrats. It appears that Colton was far less hostile to Poe than the legend will have it and his friendliness may be the result of Duyckinck's influence. (See Cullen B. Colton, "George Hooker Colton and the Publication of the Raven," American Literature , X, 319-330.) 96 These three publications had not been previously noticed. The text of "The Raven" follows the Evening Mirror printing except for minor variations in punctuation and three obvious misprints, repeated in the Weekly News version. (see Floyd Stovall's definitive edition of The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe [1965], pp. 261-266.) 97 See G. Thomas Tanselle, "An Unknown Early Appearance of the 'Raven'," Studies in Bibliography , XVI (1963), 220-223. See also, G. Thomas Tanselle, "Unrecorded Early Reprintings of Two Poe Tales," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , LVI (1962), 252. 98 See his letter to Evert A. Duyckinck of March 15, 1845. It is interesting to note that in this letter Simms does his best to present himself as a friend of Poe, which he is not. Moreover, he unearths a very old story about Poe's blasting review of his Partisan , obviously to exculpate himself from Poe's accusation (held ten years before) that he had been a member of the Knickerbocker clique: "He [Poe] knew, or he might have known, that I was none of that miserable gang about town, who begged in the literary highways. I had no clique, mingled with none, begged no praise from anybody, and made no condition with the herd." The Letters of William G. Simms (ed. Oliphant et al.) II, 43. Simms, who spent part of the year in New York, had been in fact very close to the Knickerbocker group, had been praised in the columns of the Knickerbocker and now attempts to remove the blot on his scutcheon for he, too, expects to have his works published in the "Library of American Books." 99 Broadway Journal , I (February 8, 1845), 82-83. 100 Ibid. , I (March 8, 1845), 159. 101 See Poe to Duyckinck: "I have already drawn . . . $50 (on account of the 'Parnassus')" ( Letters, I, 301). 102 The articles he published in other magazines were also favorable to the Young Americans. See, e.g.: "Big Abel and the Little Manhattan," Godey's Lady's Book , XXXI (November 1845), 218-219; "The Wigwam and the Cabin," ibid. , XXXII (January 1846), 41-42; the "Literati" sketches of Duyckinck and Caroline M. Kirkland (her Western Clearings had appeared as no. VII of "The Library of American Books"), ( Works , XV, 58-61 and 84-88); "Our Book Shelves," Aristidean , I (September and October 1845), 234-242 and 320-322. 103 See e.g. "Society for the Promotion of Mutual Admiration," Knickerbocker , XXVI (March 1845), 259-260; or Knickerbocker , XXVI (December 1895), 581 (". . . the personal friend of Mr. Matthews [sic], his admirer and reviewer, the Aristarchus of the Ladies' Magazines"). 104 North American Review , LXIII (October 1846), 359. The Catalogue of the American Art Association, Anderson Galleries, Inc. (1929), offered for sale "The original Manuscript of a critical review of the 'Works of William Gilmore Simms' by Edgar Allan Poe" (Sale Number 3800, article 286, p. 70). The few sentences from this article reproduced in photostat and printed in the catalogue coincide exactly with the first paragraph of Felton's review of Simms quoted above. As they are obviously in Poe's handwriting, it seems safe to assume that Poe had been taking notes either to answer Felton or to quote his review in his projected book on literary America. 105 See, e.g., "A Fable for Critics," Southern Literary Messenger (March 1849) and Works , XIII, 165-175.

      <field name="heading_text">William Gilmore Simms and the Southern Literary Gazette by John C. Guilds</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One aspect of William Gilmore Simms's career largely overlooked is his role as the most important magazine editor of the Old South. William Stanley Hoole's article 1 briefly outlines Simms's editorial career, but much material now available was unused by Hoole. William Peterfield Trent's biography 2 gives an inadequate picture of Simms the editor; probably because he did not see many of them, Trent discusses comparatively few of Simms's magazine articles. More recent studies of the Album and Cosmopolitan reveal that even as a youthful editor Simms displayed the seemingly effortless versatility and fecund but careless creativity that were to earmark his efforts as a mature writer; already he had developed the credo for his literary career. 3 An even more important magazine in the biography of Gilmore Simms is sandwiched between the Album and the Cosmopolitan : the Southern Literary Gazette , another early Charleston periodical (1828-1829), contains valuable revelations of his development as editor, critic, poet, and writer of fiction. This article is an account of Simms's editorial and authorial connections with this ambitious but ill-fated journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On June 7, 1828, the Charleston Courier contained "Proposals for publishing by subscription, a Weekly Literary Gazette to be entitled 'The Tablet,'" a prospectus signed by two local literary figures, James Wright Simmons, Harvard-educated poet, playwright, and essayist, a man in his late thirties with experience both in belles-lettres and in business; 4 and William Gilmore Simms, Jr., now twenty-two years old and the author of three modest volumes of verse and formerly an editor of another Charleston miscellany, the Album (1825). Simms's editorship of the Album probably accounts for the similarity between the plans proposed for "The Tablet" and those which had been announced for the Album . Like the Album , "The Tablet" was to be a weekly "Literary Miscellany" of eight pages with an especial appeal to women readers and with the express purpose of encouraging "native genius." Perhaps the editors' promise "to exercise no undue severity to what we may reject" is an admission by Simms that he had been too severe a critic in the Album for his would-be contributors' propre amore . 5 Probably, too, Simmons — the older man — had a calming influence on his young and impetuous partner. At any rate, it seems certain that the two men had at first decided to model their projected journal on the same plan as that of the Album — a sort of composite of Salmagundi and the New York Mirror . 6 Three weeks later, however, these plans were abruptly cast aside; on June 27 — the day the original prospectus ceased to appear in the Courier — Simms and Simmons ran an almost entirely new prospectus in the City Gazette , in which they announced their decision to make their magazine a monthly rather than a weekly. The long, specific statement of their intentions reads in part: The Editors of the TABLET having been encouraged by their friends to extend the plan of the Work to a MONTHLY JOURNAL, notify their subscribers, that the publication will be issued in this more eligible form. . . . . The proprietors have been reduced to believe . . . that in the intervals between the quarterly appearance of the Southern Review 7 . . . a work of humbler pretensions, but alike devoted to the cause of literature and fine arts . . . might not inconsistently . . . put forth its claims to a portion of the public patronage and regard. . . . Above all, it will be their [the editors'] object to encourage the efforts and do justice to the claims of native genius. . . . 8 Thus the Southern Literary Gazette was born. It is not difficult to understand why the two young editors decided to "extend" their proposed weekly gazette into a monthly. Simms, at least, had already tried his hand at a weekly, and remembering that the Album had not achieved overwhelming success, probably was willing enough to transfer his talents and efforts to the greater latitude allowed by a monthly journal. Then, too, perhaps finances entered into the decision: the young editors may have reasoned (logically enough) that twelve sixtyfour page octavo numbers could be issued at less expense than could fifty-two eight page quarto numbers; the price per annum remained four dollars. The first prospectus had announced that "The Tablet" would be "issued as soon as a sufficient number of subscribers are obtained." It is possible that the editors or proprietors, 9 seeing that the desired number of subscribers would not be forthcoming, determined to use their funds to begin a monthly, which in addition to lower overhead costs would afford them a longer opportunity between issues to collect acceptable contributions and — incidentally — new subscribers. By concentrating on a few opening monthly numbers, the editors perhaps felt that they could win the confidence and support of their native state much more readily than by hurriedly piecing together weekly issues — and, as has been said, at less initial expense. It is significant, however, that although the second prospectus mentions no department for the "Ladies," such as the first had elegantly described, the chief purpose of the new gazette remained unchanged: the encouragement of native genius. In fact, the editors time and again restated their aims; the "Advertisement" which appears in the front of the first volume repeats what was said in the second prospectus and adds in a final paragraph that "the Editors hope they may confidently look for no small share" of support from "their own immediate townsmen." Despite their wise change in plans, it was not until September that Simms and Simmons felt that they had enough subscribers or contributions to issue their first number. The Charleston newspapers gave the new magazine favorable publicity, 10 but the two editors were not entirely pleased with the early issues of their journal. In the October number they apologized for the "small errors" which from their "want of practice in proofreading," they had "permitted to escape [their] view" (I, 128). A statement in the November number suggests that already the editors were having difficulty in getting enough material to fill their magazine; apologizing that the number had not been issued on the first day of the month as the prospectus had promised, they announced that thereafter they would be forced to use a "somewhat larger" type in order to issue their numbers promptly "on the fifteenth day of every month." 11 Further in the same notice the young journalists stated that "our patronage is too limited as yet to warrant a continuance of our plan" to publish a series of engravings of wellknown Charleston public buildings (I, 192). Whatever the misgivings of its editors, the Southern Literary Gazette continued to receive the support of the local newspapers. The City Gazette of November 27, 1828, for instance, spoke of the "sterling richness of the contents" of the November number, 12 and the Courier , strangely reviewing the December-January number as late as March 2, 1829, had nothing but praise for the young literary journal. In closing, the Courier made a plea in behalf of the new magazine: We do indulge in the earnest hope, that our Charleston public will liberally support a work of so much merit, as the one before us. Even the youthful town of Cincinnati, put[s] out its monthly periodical: And it would be derogating, indeed, from our liberality, were we to permit ours to fall through, for want of proper encouragement. The Gazette . . . purely maintains the spirit of Southern Literature, which has before this time received commendation abroad. And it is a fact too, . . . that that Literature, which springs up and grows in one's soil, is best suited to its community. . . . There is something manly and candid in this paper, which we must all admire: and emanating as it does, from the purest patriotism and justice, we cannot but yield it our support. A magazine cannot live on praise alone, however, and after five numbers of the Southern Literary Gazette had been issued, the business-minded Simmons decided to let his partner continue the struggle alone. The two parted with no ill feelings, for Simms probably welcomed the opportunity to become sole editor of a magazine for the first time in his career, 13 and Simmons was gracious enough, in the announcement of his withdrawal, to express faith in his colleague's ability. In a statement of his own Simms confidently predicted the success of the magazine; he announced a "New Series . . . . [to] be issued on superior paper in an improved form. . . ." (I, 386). Plans for the "New Series" were elaborated upon by the editor in the "Prospectus" apparently issued with the May 15, 1829, opening number. He frankly admitted that "some [improvement] . . . is thought necessary," and having observed that essays "in which abstract points are discussed, and opinions given, . . . are seldom read," he proposed so "to vary the character of the contents, . . . as to put something within the reach of every patron, calculated as well for amusement as instruction." Stating that he had arranged with A. F. Cunningham, printer, for "the regular publication of the Gazette," the young editor announced that the journal would thereafter be issued semi-monthly. The work [he continued] will be divided into three distinct departments — viz. 1. Critical Notices of New Publications, principally American, or such of foreign original, as may bear upon our Institutions, or Literature. 2. Original Poetry. 3. A General Miscellany. It is contemplated to make this last department particularly comprehensive, and to include in its formula, Essays, Tales, Sketches, Anecdotes, &amp;c. To these may be added a fourth department, appropriated to local occurrences entirely. The whole formed upon the plan of The Critic of New York. 14 Simms further explained that the critical department, which was to be modeled on that of the London Literary Gazette , 15 would contain "not only a synopsis of the work reviewed, but a liberal portion of the most interesting parts, extracted, with a view to the full illustration of the text. . . ." He requested correspondents to keep in mind "the length of an article" because "we have certain limits, over which we cannot pass" if the miscellaneous character of the magazine was to be preserved. The editor concluded the long prospectus with a general statement of his objectives. Regretting "the cold indifference" that "has heretofore . . . repelled the progress" of literature in the South, he expressed confidence that "the application of individual energies, will go far to remove the contempt and apathy, into which our mental reputation has fallen." The Courier of May 16 contained an announcement by the new publisher, A. F. Cunningham, promising that "nothing shall be wanting on his part, to render it [the Gazette ] fully equal in typography and execution, to any periodical from the Southern Press." He added that he intended to include in each number the words and notes of "original or selected Music" and occasionally to publish engravings. With these promises — none of which, unfortunately, he was able to keep — Cunningham expressed the hope that his work, "so peculiarly Southern in its character, and the only semi-monthly in the South," would not be viewed "by his fellow citizens with apathy or indifference." Simms was more fortunate in carrying out his plans than was his publisher. The first number of the "New Series" was divided into three sections: "Critical Notices of New Publications," "Original Poetry," and "General Miscellany" — each of which conformed to the description given in the prospectus. All of the pieces were brief, there being no fewer than twenty-three titles in twenty-two pages of actual text. In typography the new Gazette seemed inferior to the old: the print was smaller, and the pages were now divided into two columns — hardly a convenience to the reader. On the whole, however, the format was not unattractive, and it was designed to catch the eye of the casual reader. In content, the volume comprising the new series is more noticeably different from the first volume in tone than in merit; the contents of both are for the most part amateurish, but a flippancy and a good-humored cockiness — which probably can be traced to Simms's free rein — seem to pervade the semi-monthly that were lacking in the monthly. These traits are apparent particularly in the "Critical Notices," written largely by Simms, which today are by far the most interesting and most rewarding sections of the new series. In both volumes, the heavy hand of morality and sentimentality rules the poetry and the fiction. If Simms succeeded in giving more appeal to the Southern Literary Gazette after he took over the editorship alone, it is largely because he knew his audience: he recognized that the long, high-toned "abstract" essays of the monthly Gazette had discouraged all but the most faithful and avid readers, and he sought a remedy by making his magazine a semi-monthly, which had the advantages of being more miscellaneous in content and more timely in appearance. For a while the magazine seems to have thrived under the new policy. At the time the third number went to press, Simms appears to have been well pleased with the public's response to the appeal for additional contributors: "Truly have our Correspondents been liberal and attentive. We . . . have been enabled to close our desk for the first time for the last six months and take a lounge through King street of an afternoon . . ." (n.s., I, 72). And again in the fourth number, Simms asked his correspondents to have "patience," adding that "In our next we shall endeavor to give them all a place" (n.s., I, 96). But apparently the Southern Literary Gazette was still insecure financially: the failure of the promised engravings to appear indicates as much. And perhaps it was partly because contributors were decreasing in number that Simms suggested a month later that Southerners visiting in the North "should afford us in lieu of their presence, some little account of the parts they visit, the curiosities they see, and the humors and thought their adventures may give rise to" (n.s., I, 159). Simms nevertheless continued to regard the semi-monthly as a more popular medium with the reading public than the monthly. Indeed, as early as August he was already mentioning the possibility of converting his journal into a weekly, in order further to please his readers. In commenting on John Neal's Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette , Simms remarked: The [ Yankee's ] change from the weekly, to the monthly form, can hardly be considered of advantage, if we may judge in any measure of the Boston by the Carolinian taste. With us, nothing is readable, that requires an effort, and the material of the Quarterly and Monthly, is wretchedly fatiguing to the summer reader. Even now, we are called upon to effect another change and make ours a weekly. We could make it what-ever the public thinks best, could we be paid for it. What says 'The Yankee' (n.s., I, 159). It is probable, then, that Simms had already discussed with publisher James S. Burges the plans for a weekly journal, to begin as soon as the present volume of the Gazette was completed. Although Simms's name is nowhere mentioned in the prospectus, Burges obviously had him in mind as editor: The Pleiades A WEEKLY LITERARY GAZETTE, TO BE PUBLISHED IN CHARLESTON, S. CAROLINA. We have long thought, that a weekly publication entirely devoted to light and miscellaneous literature, would meet with a ready and liberal patronage in this community. We now make the experiment. Our editors have hitherto confined their attention very selfishly to the wants and requirements of their own sex, leaving unnoticed that finer portion of creation, to the amusement and instruction of which, as well as that of our own order, our labors shall in future be equally directed. To them, therefore, we look for patronage and encouragement. We propose "The Pleiades," as a receptacle for that light and graceful literature, original and selected, which is calculated for the occasional amusement and gratification of the public. As as weekly melange , in which the gentleman and the lady — the old and the young — intelligent and uninformed, will equally find something to relieve the weight of graver employment, and to dissipate the burden of troublesome and unpleasant hours. Original and selected Tales — Moral Essays — Poetry, and miscellaneous original and selected literature, pruned and gathered into shape, will form its principal contents — over the morals of which a scrupulous and discriminating caution will be carefully exercised and maintained. " The Pleiades " will be published weekly, commencing on the first Saturday in November next, in a form of eight medium quarto pages, and will be put to subscriber at $4 per annum, if paid in advance, or $5 at the the expiration of six months ; Single numbers, 12½ cents each. No subscriptions received for a less term than one year , when the volume will be completed. . . . JAMES S. BURGESS, Publisher, Charleston, S. C. 16 Although this prospectus seems to announce a completely independent "new" magazine, Simms, upon assuming the editorship, preserved the identity of his old periodical by entitling the new journal the Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette , apparently only a single abortive issue of which was to appear before its decease. Thus the third attempt in less than a year to give the Southern Literary Gazette a new face (and new life) failed. First announced as a weekly literary gazette, even before its first appearance it had been modified into a monthly; then, after six months of limited success, one of its editors had withdrawn and the other had carried on alone under a new publisher and a new policy, announcing that thereafter the Gazette would appear twice monthly. For another six months, then, the Gazette was issued semi-monthly, again, however, without achieving prosperity. At the end of this period the second publisher left the field, a third one stepped in (obviously by prearrangement), and with Simms still at the helm, a "new" magazine with a new title and policy was issued, only to die after a single number. This new policy was strikingly similar to that which at the very beginning had been proclaimed for "The Tablet," under which title, of course, the magazine never appeared. Thus, the Southern Literary Gazette (for all three magazines are now so called) had gone full circle; first and last announced to be a weekly gazette, it appeared both monthly and semi-monthly but never actually weekly, because its first number under that standard was also its last. Unfortunately, however, that last number (or the first number in the third series — the number published under the title Pleiades ) has apparently completely escaped our libraries and collectors; 17 and because it is not positively known that a twelfth number for the second series was issued, a very special problem arises in connection with Simms's assigning the earliest version of the story of Martin Faber to "some eight or ten pages in the second volume" of the Southern Literary Gazette . 18 It is generally believed that the second series of the Gazette was concluded with the eleventh (or October 15, 1829) number; 19 if so, the "Confessions of a Murderer" must have appeared in the single issue of the Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette , for the story is not included in numbers 1-11 of the second series. There are reasons, however, to believe that the twelfth number of the new series was issued and that the forerunner of Martin Faber actually was published (as Simms has stated) in the "second volume." The Charleston Courier for October 29, 1829, contains the following: The following are the contents of the twelfth Number, for November, of the Southern Literary Gazette : 1. The Charter Oak; 2. Confessions of a Murderer; 3. On the Death of an Infant; 4. Epigram; 5. Capt. Hall on his Tour; 6. Epitaph; 7. Bacon's 'Novum Organon Scientiarium[']; 8. Epitaph; 9. Prospects of a National Literature; 10. To Thee; 11. Chronicles of Ashley River — No. 6; 12. Stanzas; 13. Glances at Adam Smith; 14. Rain not Wanted; 15. Excerpts; 16. Stanzas; 17. The Opportunity; 18. On Reading the Works of an American Poet who Died of Want; 19. L'Envoy; 20. Table of Contents. This notice, appearing only a few days before the twelfth number was due, definitely indicates that the November 1, 1829, issue of the Southern Literary Gazette was planned and assembled with the intention of publication. Whether the number ever was actually published or whether, as J. Allen Morris guesses, this proposed issue "came out on Nov. 7, 1829, . . . under the title of the Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette " 20 cannot be known until at least one or the other number turns up. The brief notice of the Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette in the Courier , November 9, 1829, which closes with the hope that the "new weekly miscellany" will "meet with that favor, which its spirited manner, and neat execution merits," is of no help in solving this perplexing problem. Unless, however, the prospectus of the Pleiades was incorrect in stating that the new weekly would consist of "eight medium quarto pages" 21 and unless Simms's memory failed him completely in his statement that the "Confessions of a Murderer" filled "some eight or ten pages," the logical conclusion seems to be that the "Confessions" did appear in a twelfth number in the second series. Further support for this contention comes from the fact that the eleventh number (for October 15, 1829) contains no mention that it would be the last issue in the "new" or second series, despite the fact that an additional number was needed to complete what normally constitutes a volume. Why the Pleiades failed after a single issue can only be surmised, but whatever the reason, Simms was not long away from the editorial fauteuil (as he liked to put it), for at the beginning of the new year he became editor and one of the proprietors of the City Gazette and Commercial Advertiser , the first of four newspapers with which he was to have editorial connections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II In examining the Southern Literary Gazette for Simms's contributions, one quickly discovers that the editor of the Gazette was almost literally the author of the Gazette . Some idea of how great a portion of the magazine is his own work can be gained from the fact that no fewer than twenty-eight of the forty-one poems in the first volume were written by this amazingly facile young man. And because his partner, James Wright Simmons, contributed at least six of the thirteen poems not ascribed to Simms, it is apparent that the two editors wrote at least eighty per cent of the verse to appear in their joint venture. Indeed, the only poem in the first volume of the Gazette that definitely can be assigned to someone other than Simms or Simmons is William Henry Timrod's "Time's Trophies." 22 Probably the two young co-editors wrote just as high a proportion of prose in the first volume as they did of the poetry, but the authorship of the prose contributions is exceedingly difficult to establish because (except in rare cases) there are not even pseudonyms or initials to serve as clues. There is no reason, however, to believe that Simms and Simmons (particularly Simms) were any less prolific in writing prose than poetry. On the contrary, if indeed they were hard pressed for contributors, they probably were forced to write many last-minute articles to fill in vacant pages in their journal. At any rate, it seems safe to assume that Simms wrote far more prose for the six numbers in the first volume than the seven titles (not including book reviews) that definitely can be ascribed to him. Upon taking over the sole editorship of the Gazette at the beginning of the new series, Simms was faced with the problem either of getting more contributors or of writing his magazine practically alone. And again, either by choice or by necessity, he seems to have borne the major responsibility for keeping the pages filled. To the eleven available numbers of the new series, he contributed at least thirty-two poems, ten essays, three "sketches" or brief short stories, and one series of tales published in five installments — not to mention a new section entitled "Critical Notices," which must have been almost altogether his own work. Furthermore, on the basis of internal evidence four other poems and eight other prose titles can probably be added to this impressive list. In all, then, Simms's contributions — probable and proved, to both new series and old — number 101, still excluding all book reviews and notices for correspondents or subscribers. These 101 23 contributions embrace sixty-four poems, twenty-three essays, nine sketches (as Simms liked to call his brief short stories), and the five "Chronicles of Ashley River" — a series of tales of colonial Indian warfare. Almost half of these contributions are unsigned in any fashion; the remainder are signed with fourteen pseudonyms 24 as follows: "Alwyn," one; "Amand," two; "E.," nine; "Florio," two; "G.," thirteen; "Linus," four; "M.," nine; "Mary," one; "P.," two; "R. H.," one; "S.," two; "Vidal," one; "Walterboro'," one; and "W. G. S.," four. Six of these noms de plume — "E.," "Florio," "G.," "M.," "P.," and "S.," — had also been used in the Album . Perhaps the outstanding work in the Southern Literary Gazette is "The Lost Pleiad," sometimes considered the best of Simms's generally inane poetry. This earliest version is essentially the same poem collected in Poems Descriptive, Dramatic, Legendary and Contemplative (1853), although Simms expanded it from forty-four to fifty-three lines and revised (even rewrote) many individual lines. In nearly every case the revision improved the poem. "The Lost Pleiad" in any version stands far above the other poetry in the Southern Literary Gazette , most of which is mediocre. One wonders if the success of "The Lost Pleiad" could have had any bearing on Simms's choice of Pleiades as the title for the new journal he edited for James S. Burges. The title (both of the poem and of the magazine) perhaps suggests that the work was intended primarily for women readers. Probably the best of the other Simms poems in the Southern Literary Gazette are those that he selected for the 1853 and the 1860 editions of his poems, among which are "The Streamlet," "The Spring," "Fancy," "Morning in the Forest," "Lights of Hearts and Love," "Lines" (beginning "My life is in the yellow leaf"), "Concealed Character," "The Grave in the Forest," and a few of his "Songs" and "Sonnets." Also worthy of comment is "Great is the Yemassee," a poem included in the second of the "Chronicles of Ashley River": "Great is the Yemassee" is the original of the highly effective "Mighty is the Yemassee" which appears in Chapter XXII of The Yemassee (1835). But if Simms did not write a piece of prose fiction for the Gazette equal in merit with "The Lost Pleiad," his sketches and tales taken as a group far surpass his poems taken collectively. The five "Chronicles of Ashley River," in which Simms depicted "one of those sad and grievous encounters between the whites and the savages of the western wilderness" (n.s., I, 176), anticipate his novels of Indian warfare in colonial South Carolina, The Yemassee and The Cassique of Kiawah . Sergeant Rory M'Alister, a loquacious but manly Irishman with heavy brogue, and Redfoot, a cunning, intelligent Yemassee chief who speaks perfect English, are both well-conceived characters. The "Chronicles" are episodic and melodramatic but nevertheless display some of the author's skill as a narrator. In "Indian Sketch" (later revised, expanded, and retitled "Oakatibbe; or the Choctaw Sampson") Simms made some interesting comments on the distorted portrayals of Indian character in contemporary novels and poems: Nothing can be more amusing to one who is at all intimate with the Indian character, than the various pictures which are given them by the Poet and the novelist. Nothing more idle and extravagant. The glory of the Indians (as they were) is the hunt and the battle field; and in robbing them of the extent of country sufficient for the one pursuit, and exercising such a powerful restraint upon them, as a ready and well-armed frontier, in the other, we seem to have robbed them of all of that pride, love of adventure and warlike enthusiasm, which is the only romance, the North American Indian ever had in his character (I, 144). Already, then, Simms's interest in the Indian and his insistence upon realistic treatment of history had combined to make him highly critical of the romantically conceived "savage." 25 Another of the more interesting pieces of fiction in the Southern Literary Gazette is the sketch entitled "A Picture of the Sea." One wonders if Poe, who, as Sergeant Edgar A. Perry, was stationed at Fort Moultrie near Charleston in 1828, did not read this tale in the December number of the Gazette . 26 If so, certain passages in "A Picture of the Sea" may have given him the germ for his own "MS. Found in a Bottle," which in 1833 won the story contest conducted by the Baltimore Saturday Visitor . The similarities between these two supernatural tales of the sea are in some ways too striking to be ignored: both are narrated in the first person by a ship passenger who professes disbelief in superstition, but is awed by it; in both a sudden furious storm strikes after the sea has taken on a mysterious foreboding appearance; in both a huge ship manned by immortals (the "Flying Dutchman" theme) suddenly and unaccountably appears during the storm to crash down upon and sink the narrator's ship; in both there are at first two survivors, one of whom later is killed, and in both the narrator (the sole survivor) faces certain death, which fact presents a peculiar problem for the author. Simms got out of this difficulty in the conventional manner — by having the narrator awaken from a dream; Poe solved the problem much more artistically by putting to use the idea made explicit by his title. There is no question of plagiarism, of course, because Poe (granted that he had seen Simms's story) used his own genius to carve a new tale from the mere framework supplied by Simms. But "A Picture of the Sea" would be no discredit to any writer: the descriptions of the storm and of the frightening appearance of the phantom ship are vivid and terrifying; the grim struggle to death between the unheroic narrator and the other survivor over possession of a spar large enough to support only one of them is an early example of Simms's realism. 27 Among the best of the other tales in the Southern Literary Gazette are "The Cypress Swamp," "The Fisherman — A Fact," and "Omens of War — A Recollection," all three signed with the pseudonym, "E." Simms obviously incorporated some of "The Cypress Swamp" — which is in reality a mere descriptive sketch — into those scenes in The Partisan that have their setting in the South Carolina lowlands swamps. 28 "The Fisherman — A Fact" is a delightful story of a Southern gentleman who attempts to recover the fortune he has lost through folly and hard luck by fishing each day for a water-buried treasure, which he hopes to ensnare on his fishing hook. His strange actions convince his Negro assistants that he is the devil himself "'wid a big fishing line in 'e hand, ready for hook your poor spirit, 'fore 'e lef your body'" (n.s., I, 244). Humor and irony were not Simms's fortes, but in this tale he handled both much better than he was wont to do. "Omens of War — A Recollection" is another early treatment by Simms of a Revolutionary War theme. It has to do with a veteran of the Revolution who in 1776 had seen a vision of approaching war similar to the phenomenon witnessed by the citizens of a little town in interior South Carolina sometime during "the summer of eighteen hundred and eleven, a short time before the declaration of the war with Great Britain" (n.s., I, 179). Other stories deserving mention include those demonstrating Simms's great fondness for German literature. One, "The Dead Lover," published anonymously in the February, 1829, number, is a ghost story based partly on Burger's "Lenore" and partly on the Faust legend. 29 "The Dead Lover" ranks higher as a work of art than does the greatly expanded version published in 1837 under the title "The Spirit Bridegroom." Most of the mystery and suggestive power of the original are destroyed by the over elaboration of details in the story in its later form. If, however, the number of the Gazette containing the "Confessions of a Murderer" were available, that tale would certainly prove the most interesting in the entire series. Even without the opportunity to examine the "Confessions of a Murderer" at first hand, however, one is not hard pressed to find a clue as to its probable inspiration. In February, 1829, there appeared in the Gazette the first of two installments of "The Criminal, from the German of Schiller." 30 "The Criminal," like Martin Faber (and apparently, then, also like the "Confessions of a Murderer"), attempts to show how environment and circumstance can make a criminal — even a murderer — of an ordinary man. 31 Both "The Criminal" and Martin Faber are psychological studies in the degeneration of character, and both carry the implication that society is at least partly to blame for the crimes committed by the hero. Thus there are similarities in setting, tone, plot, and purpose in "The Criminal" and Martin Faber ; there is Simms's own assertion of the close resemblance of Martin Faber to the "Confessions of a Murderer"; there is knowledge that Simms was a great admirer of Schiller; and there is the fact that a translation of Der Verbrecher was readily available in the pages of the Gazette itself: the accumulated evidence leads one to believe that Simms had Schiller's story in mind and perhaps in hand when he sat down to write the "Confessions of a Murderer." In fact, although Professor Cardwell has pointed out that in Charleston "Knowledge of German, to all literary purposes, was practically non-existent in the earlier years of the nineteenth century" (pp. 32-33), there are other indications in the Southern Literary Gazette that Simms was quick to perceive the great potentialities in the study of German literature. One finds awareness on Simms's part (in the essay entitled "German Literature") that "At present there is, perhaps, no portion of Literary history of more importance to us, than that of Germany. Rising as we are into a state of refined Literature, and about to establish for ourselves a national character, it must be advantageous to examine those principles by the adoption of which her people have risen up to an independence of thought, and have become eminent in the several departments of learning" (n.s., I, 197). In later years Simms was to write appreciative criticisms of Goethe and Fouque as well as of Schiller. 32 For purposes of discussion, Simms's essays and critical notices can probably best be treated together. The essays are of almost no importance as works of literature, because it is obvious that most of them were written to be mere space-fillers. Some few, however, like most of the reviews, are interesting in that they reflect the author's opinions on literary or cultural matters or in that they pertain to editorial policy. An essay of the latter type is the "Introduction" to the first volume — an essay which obviously must embody ideas that both Simms and Simmons held and had discussed together. In the opening paragraph the editors made it clear that one of their purposes was to condemn American dependence upon and imitation of British literary taste: Periodical Literature has for the last century been liberally patronised by the taste of the reading public; and in Great Britain the number of quarterly, monthly and weekly journals and gazettes has been continually on the increase; so much so, indeed, as almost to have exceeded the demand for such works. The time has arrived, or is fast approaching, when a similar taste in this country shall call for the supply of similar mental aliment to be furnished from among ourselves; and supposing this stage in our literary advancement as a people, to have been reached or to be near at hand, it may not be amiss to offer some reflections upon the subject. The first remark that suggests itself, on taking a survey of the actual state and prospective advancement of our literature, is, the unfortunate relation in which we stand, and seem almost unavoidably to have been placed, with regard to the 'Mother Country,' — as we are still pleased to designate a soil which first ejected us from its bowels, and afterwards put in requisition its energies to destroy us — on matters which have been viewed by every people who have attained to any thing like a national character, as of the very last importance: — our laws, and the literature which is necessarily so intimately connected with them (I, 1). In closing their "Introduction" the editors asserted that "it will be their earnest and zealous endeavour to give to the Southern Literary Gazette a character as sterling as may be consistent with the nature and the ends implied and embraced in a monthly paper devoted to the Fine Arts and general Literature." To fulfill this pledge, Simms and Simmons announced that "they will consider it their bounden duty to exercise a rigid censorship, not less over the manners than the matter of their pages. . . ." With this goal in view the editors hoped that contributors would "bestow such care and attention upon the articles they may send for insertion . . ., as may render them not wholly unworthy of the taste and intelligence, which . . . the Editors have every reason to believe will be brought to the perusal of this and the ensuing numbers . . ." (I, 8). This emphasis upon the moral as well as the aesthetic function of the work again indicates that the Southern Literary Gazette was designed for parlor reading by fashionable Charleston ladies and gentlemen. Thoughts of his women subscribers may also have prompted Simms's highly complimentary remarks about "Female Editors" in the seventh number of the new series. The essay is definitely designed to please and to flatter women readers as well as the women editors involved. "A new epoch," Simms began, "may be noted in the Literature of the United States, at this time; and one, calculated, as well from its novelty as interest, to excite no little wonder and admiration. We mean the Editorship of sundry Literary Journals, by Ladies. . . ." He singled out for particular praise two magazines "edited by Ladies, who, no doubt, are fully as handsome and delightful, as they are intelligent. . . . The Journals we refer to, are 'The Ladies Magazine' edited by Mrs. Sarah J. Hale, and 'The Bower of Taste,' by Mrs. Katharine A. Ware. . . . they do high credit to the fair conductors, and are well worthy the patronage of the fairer portion of the community. We hope they have it" (n.s., I, 167-168). The unsigned essay "Modern Biography" in the December, 1828, Gazette calls contemporary biographers to task for carelessness in their art. In the light of Simms's later efforts at biography, the following comments seem worthy of record: There is perhaps no branch of modern literature, so completely systematized as the art of writing men's lives — no species of composition, that, judging by the books of the kind put forth for the last twenty years, is so little susceptible of originality or improvement. A style the most puerile, and a plan the most awkward and contemptible, seems to pervade the whole of them, not even excepting those, which, were we to judge of them by the celebrity of their authors, we might expect to find the most able and entertaining. . . (I, 221). Some of Simms's most significant remarks, however, appear in the piece entitled "Modern Criticism" (n.s., I, 173-174). In this essay he took his stand for "fair and impartial criticism," the benefits from which "can no more be doubted than the common advantages which result from education." He defined true criticism as a liberal and humane art, the offspring of good sense and refined taste; an art aiming to acquire a just discernment of the real merits of authors, which preserves us from that blind and implicit veneration which would confound their blemishes and beauties in our esteem. In short it teaches us to admire and to blame with judgment, and not to follow the crowd blindly. It follows, then, Simms added, "that to merit the high and distinguished title of critic," one must possess more than genius and reputation: . . . something more is indispensably necessary to enable us to take our stand, as the directors and advisors of others; that our critiques should be entitled to credit, they should be just and true , and to be just and true, we ourselves must not regard the person writing, but the thing written, we must endeavour as far as in us lays the power, wholly to divest ourselves of every kind of prejudice. . . . With these requisites for a critic, to which, of course, must always be added every qualification which talent and industry afford, it is not easy to estimate the real value which must in all enlightened communities attach to our reviews of the productions of others; we shall by this means advance the literature of our country; we shall become . . . guardians of the portals of Fame's temple, not exactly forbidding unfledged genius to enter, but turning it back with all reasonable hopes for future success. . . . Later Simms pointed out, however, that "with some few exceptions. . . . our critics of today" do not answer the definition we have given above, they are not totally unprejudiced . . . . judging from the evidences we have seen both in the United States and Europe, we should even hazard the remark that many books are reviewed before the reviewer has fully read the contents of them ; that many times the book is merely used as the text for a commentary upon which it treats. . . . The critic who "lashes without mercy" when "his strictures should assume the form of friendly advice" particularly aroused Simms's contempt. Such a critic, he said, "is rather more bent upon displaying his peculiar skill, than improving the defects of the author. It is this shameful want of discrimination which has cast an indelible stain upon some of the foreign reviews of every thing American . . . ." This severe criticism, Simms summed up in conclusion, "so far from advancing the literature of a country, rather retards it, and sometimes stunts it in its growth." Although Simms was later to write much with regard to the functions of a critic, this essay penned at the age of twenty-three is one of the best expressions of his ideas on the subject. These ideas he maintained consistently throughout his career. Perhaps the most sensational piece of criticism in the Southern Literary Gazette is the review of Leigh Hunt's Lord Byron and His Contemporaries . Simms was quick to rush to the defense of the darling of his magazine, Byron, who "is hallowed time and again in criticism and is constantly imitated" (Cardwell, p. 208) in the pages of the Gazette . He set the tone for his appraisal of Hunt's work in his opening sentence: "Really these pages are not calculated to inspire the reader with the most exalted opinion of human nature: a very sorry picture on the contrary do they present of its infirmities, its meanness and its malice." Later he pointed out the great damage Hunt had done to Byron under the pretense of friendship: There is an appearance of candor and fair dealing in these 'recollections' of Mr. Hunt; but the real design of the book is continually betraying itself — and that too in a very aukward way. 'I cannot without regret,' says Mr. H. 'think of the picture I have drawn of the infirmities of Lord Byron!' Alas! the gentleman's regret comes too late for the credit of his sincerity — so far at least as relates to Lord Byron; for we think, and our readers will probably think with us, that this 'picture' which Mr. Hunt 'regrets,' is a picture not so much of the infirmities of Lord Byron, as of the worse than infirmities of Mr. Leigh Hunt himself. "The only portion of the work worth reading," Simms added, "is an account of Shelley and Keats," both of whom he termed "men of genius." 33 But Simms did not dwell long on Hunt's treatment of Shelley and Keats; he had raised the bludgeon over Hunt's head for his mis treatment of Byron, and he did not lower it until he had pummeled the "half bred, half educated cockney" for seven long pages. In conclusion Simms asked, "Are not the friends of Lord Byron . . . ashamed of themselves? Here is a man [Hunt] whom he sheltered and perhaps fed, foremost of the vile crew who seek to hunt down his memory because its lustre throws their own in the shade?" (I, 41-47). Scott was idolized almost as much as was Byron. In reviewing Anne of Geierstein , or the Maiden of the Mist Simms tried to put into practice his theory that a critic "must not regard the person writing, but the thing written." Although Simms openly admired (and acknowledged his own debt to) "the truly astonishing and seemingly unfailing powers of a man, who is the wonder of this, and must be that of every succeeding age," he did not "pretend or affect to believe the present productions of this wonderful man's pen, as good as his secondrate previous writings . . ." (n.s., I, 126). Simms found little to his liking in the well-known last novel of one of the great figures in eighteenth-century English literature, Henry Fielding. According to Simms, the defect of Amelia , which first had been published in 1751, "is its utter want of plot. The denouement , such as it is, turns, as it were, upon a sort of casualty, which is contrary to all received notions relative to this class of productions." He admitted, however, that Fielding had "succeeded, not to the life , perhaps, so much as the letter of his fancy" in his attempt "to draw the character of a perfect wife ." "The rest of the characters," he added, "are mere sketches, or glimpses of our moral nature. There is not one elaborate or well drawn picture, no 'emphasis and thinking' about any of the persons . . ." (n.s., I, 15). Although French was almost certainly the most widely read foreign literature in early nineteenth-century Charleston (Cardwell, p. 14), there is little discussion of the literature of France within the covers of the successive volumes of the Southern Literary Gazette . High respect for the French is indicated, however, by the fact that the critical judgment of Mme. de Stael was used by a writer in the Gazette to support his own defense of modern drama (I, 89); then, too, the essay on "The Fine Arts" includes a discussion of both Grecian and French drama. Spanish literature also received attention: essays on that subject appear in both the September 15 and October 15 numbers of the new series (n.s., I, 205-206 and 259-260). Naturally, however, most of the critical comments in a journal devoted to the encouragement of national letters pertain to American writers. One of the early reviews deals with Notions of the Americans (1828), "another leaf" to Cooper's "brilliant laurel." Characteristically Simms (for he doubtless was the reviewer) praised the book for its "method" and for its "style," but also pointed out that "Mr. Cooper is singularly, we had almost said, ludicrously minute in some of his descriptions. . . . we are informed that you have 'egress from and ingress to the house, by its front and rear!' This is indeed new, and quite extraordinary." Simms later drew an interesting comparison between Cooper and Irving: The author of the "Sketch Book," labored to conciliate; Mr. Cooper is far more likely to convince. Mr. Irving's manner has been that of a well-bred man in a drawing-room, who puts away for the time his out-door prejudices, and makes the accustomed sacrifices to the prevailing etiquette; Mr. Cooper's deportment will challenge a handsome comparison with that which the poet Burns is described as observing and maintaining with such admirable dignity and self-possession, when suddenly transferred from the plough to the society of the nobility and gentry of the Scottish capital. We believe, then, that these "Notions" are likely to achieve much in behalf of the two countries; presenting, as they do, a true picture of the actual condition of these States in all their various relations. . . . (I, 174-177). Despite his admiration for Byron, Simms nevertheless felt that the English poet had exerted a bad influence upon English and American poetry in general. In heaping praise upon the Sketches of N. P. Willis in September, 1828, he commented: One remarkable feature in the poetry of Mr. Willis, is that unstrained and delicate colouring, which, while it fail[s] to draw forth our deeper emotions and loftier sympathies, comes nevertheless home to the understanding by that heart-simplicity which runs through it. We say remarkable — for the history of modern poetry both in England and America, is a laborious stretching after those morbid and diseased excitements . . . — a longing after horrors — a disposition to be excruciating — and above all a Byronic determination, rather laughable on paper, to be uncontrol[l]ably miserable and sublime. Gothic horrors, nervous affections, poisoned maids, haunted towers, robber knights, whose lives, 'Link'd with one virtue and a thousand crimes,' have been the theme of tears and lamentations . . . . Poetasters . . . found enough in the 'gigantic melancholy' of the moody 'Harold' to dazzle them into a path which they could not pursue and dreaded to depart from . . . . The evil of this school so lately, if not still so fashionable in England, however it might have become a model to American writers, did them but little injury; not from any want of defect in the system itself, but [from] the almost total absence of any thing like . . . poetical character in America . . . . This last observation was certainly well-founded, Simms remarked, "if we are to consider Mr. Percival's last Clio, (No. 3) as the clever work of our cleverest verse maker." 34 He added, however, that he had "long since ventured to dissent from the received 'lex scripta' of our friends at the North and his fellow citizens, in assigning that preference to Mr. Bryant. . . . We look forward to better things, particularly when a work so clever in promise as the 'Sketches' before us, is the subject of our present remarks." Simms pointed out, however, that the "scriptural" character "which Mr. Willis has endeavored to give his poetry" follows the leadership of another misguided school — that of the popular English poetess, Mrs. Felicia Dorothea Hemans: The fashion lately introduced by Mrs. Hemans is too generally the rage not to continue, at least for a while; and like all other new schools it will be destroyed, whatever may be its merits, by its excessive abuse. The thing is quite overdone — it is ridden down — we have now nothing but dreams and wanderings, vague, confused, and where young poetesses are concerned, certainly very indiscreet . . . . There is too much of this wandering in the poetry of Mr. Willis (I, 49-51). Later, Simms's treatment of Willis was not to be so kindly. In the July 1, 1829, number of the new series of the Gazette Simms stated that "the journals which have heretofore picked only the bones of unhappy authors, have now beg[u]n to pick one another." Because he saw "no reason why this should not be the case," Simms then proceeded to pick the bones of Willis and his American Monthly Magazine . He insisted, however, that "It is only because we are satisfied of the ability of Mr. Willis and his contributors to do well, that we have been disposed to make them do better" (n.s., I, 73, 78). 35 Perhaps the review in the Gazette that best illustrates the editor's plea for regionalism appears in the June 1 number of the new series. The book under question is Edgehill: A Novel "by a Virginian," 36 but the volume in hand is simply used as a springboard for a discussion of Southern publishing and literature. The notice opens as follows: This looks well; the South is not asleep, merely dozing, perhaps; we hope her nap will shortly be concluded. We like to see Southern books, though rough and uncourtly in outside, and wanting in those meretricious aids and ornaments which [are] the prevailing characteristic of English and Northern publications; and too frequently the only beauty they possess. A new era is commencing in the South. We have been taunted by Englishmen and Northernmen, and no men at all, so frequently, that we have at length really come to taunt ourselves, and question our right to the high names of our ancestors. We begin to think it time to do something for our own rights and reputation, and as a first step to these objects, we have begun to think and encourage those who do so. Let the good work go on, and we shall not tremble for the result. Let us only think that future days will receive as an inheritance from the present, a set of American Classics , in which the North, East, West, all will have their representation but the South; and the niche which she should occupy, may be, (if we determine, not otherwise) like the monument of the decapitated Doge, all black, blank and barren. Later Simms admitted that he had "skimmed over Edgehill . . . not to review it. We dreaded the effects of our southern prejudices in favor of a southern publication; but the journals generally, have already spoken a favorable doom and we are satisfied" (n.s., I, 33-34). Tales and Sketches, by a Country Schoolmaster, a book published anonymously by William Leggett, "late editor of the New York Critic," prompted Simms to comment on the disadvantages under which an author turned editor labors. "The Sketches," he wrote, "are just such as he [Leggett] may be supposed to have written, while conducting a Literary Journal." He pointed out that Leggett possessed talent: that if he "carefully arranged his materials and methodized his plan," he could write a novel of the West "fully as interesting and excellent as 'The Prairie.'" Simms concluded by saying: "If he will but let the 'Critic' go to the _____ in peace, and have nothing to do with any other Editorial chair; (an occupation, vile enough, heaven knows,) . . . take up Flint's books on the West, 37 and hatch a decent plot before he puts pen to paper, we shall have much pleasure, in commencing our next volume, to open with 'The Perogue' an American (?) Romance, in two volumes, &amp; c. &amp; c." (n.s., I, 102). Because the Southern Literary Gazette had promised its genteel readers that it would "exercise a rigid censorship" over morals, manners, and matters, it is not surprising to find Simms — a firm believer in the moral function of literature — saying of James K. Paulding's Tales of the Good Woman — "we do not know that we have ever read a volume of a more exalted, purely toned morality. Each story . . . has in view the inculcation of a sound rule, or the suppression of an improper principle" (n.s., I, 157-158). Simms's "Indian Sketch" is not the only writing in the Southern Literary Gazette that illustrates his interest in and knowledge of the American Indian. In a long review entitled "North American Indians" 38 in the initial number, Simms stated in greater detail the convictions that he was to repeat in the "Indian Sketch" two months later: Nothing has been more misunderstood among us than the Indian character. Like all other subjects of which little is known, and over which time has thrown an impenetrable mystery, fancy has stept in to the aid of history, and tradition has dreamed until fact has lost its character and all become poetry. Were we to believe the fanciful accounts of some of our countrymen, from whom we should have expected different things, the Indian character very nearly resembles our own . . . . It is the fashion, in speaking of an Indian Chief to picture an Ulysses, strong at the bow and matchless in the chase, with the wisdom of Mentor, full of grace and elegance, and withal as figurative as a modern poet . . . . Other writers, and particularly some of late date have fallen into another extreme in discussing the merits of this people. They are represented to be a race only notorious from their habits of filth, drunkenness and dishonesty. They are shewn us as crowded upon the towns with all these several qualities momentarily exhibited before the eyes of the white community. They are described as cunning, sullen, cowardly, revengeful and inhuman; not to be trusted, and only docile and to be depended on, while it is their interest to be so . . . . The North American Indians, are strictly speaking, a rude and simple race . . . . In regarding them . . . we must carefully avoid both of the extremes already briefly presented. We are neither to worship them as a race of demigods, nor on the other hand to despise them as a horde of brutes . . . . We are not at all disposed to look upon the Indian as a fool. We regard him rather as a rude, uninformed, and unpolished, but still, highly intellectual being: shrewd and if we are so compelled to term it, cunning in the extreme, from a habit of depending solely upon himself even from his childhood . . . (I, 36-38). Doubtless Simms's travels through the Indian country with his father and his Uncle James during his 1824-1825 visit to Mississippi largely account for his realistic conception of the Indian. 39 At least one fellow South Carolina author was reviewed by Simms in the Gazette . A Selection from the Miscellaneous Writings of the Late Isaac Harby, Esq. , 40 "arranged and published by Henry L. Pinckney and Abraham Moise, for the benefit of his family," came under consideration in the first number of the new series. Simms praised Harby particularly for his early efforts in behalf of the literature of his home state: The literary enterprise of this gentlem[a]n, at a very early period in our community fully entitles him to the appellative we have thought proper to bestow upon him. He was with us, the pioneer of literature. However humble may have been his own performances, it is no mean reputation to have prepared the way for others; to be acknowledged as one of those men, who set for us the first example of literary pursuit and enterprise (n.s., I, 8). In addition to the notice of Harby's Writings , Simms also was editorially concerned with another phase of Charleston's literary culture — its theater. Under the heading "Our Theatre" in the November, 1828, issue, Simms wrote such a stinging criticism of the production then being performed in the Charleston Theatre that the following month it was deemed necessary (probably by Simmons) to announce that "the Editors" did not wholly agree with "the opinions of the correspondent before adverted to, of our November number" (I, 265). There can be little doubt that Simms was the author of the first review since it is signed "M.," a pseudonym he used elsewhere in the Gazette . Apparently the retraction is another example of the older, more business-minded editor having a moderating influence on the less compromising nature of his partner. Simms's initial review is interesting because it voices objections to the "system of Starring ," which it termed "totally destructive of every other system of good Theatrical management." "We denounce the present system entirely," Simms added, "as not calculated to satisfy the public, reward the manager, or what is more important, encourage and bring forward dramatic talent in the humbler actors thus kept back, and absolutely ruined by it" (I, 191). On one occasion Simms is known to have rushed to the defense of the Gazette's highly regarded cross-town rival, the Southern Review . When Robert Walsh 41 irreverently called "the last number of the Southern Review, 'a collection of political pamphlets,'" Simms blazed: "Why, you unblushing varlet, how dare you style the Southern Review, or any other review, 'a collection of political pamphlets' — you who, under cover of a literary title, made your miserable American Review a vehicle for slanderous vituperation, and the virulent outpourings of a party spirit, which you have no longer either the credit or ability to support" (I, 262-263). This outburst illustrates once again the boldness and the daring of the self-assured young editor — the same fiery impetuosity which the calmer Simmons tried on several occasions to cool. Among the "Critical Notices" in the new series of the Southern Literary Gazette , it was customary to include reviews of contemporary magazines as well as of books. The review of the New York Mirror is notable because the Mirror was one of the journals used as a guide in establishing the Album and (probably) the Southern Literary Gazette . As would be expected, Simms had high words of praise for the Mirror , "without exception, the neatest Journal of Literature in the country." He particularly commended the "manly and honest" tone and the " novel courtesy" of the Mirror in dealing with the literature and the politics of the South. Such treatment, he concluded, "will teach us that the prospect is not wholly visionary, which is to bring us into the rank and repute of civilization and exalt us from our present state of barbarism, into equality and esteem" (n.s., I, 127). Simms's review of the Baltimore Minerva and Emerald , in which he spoke of Rufus Dawes, its editor, as "an American poet of some cleverness" and jokingly complained of the inferior paper on which the Minerva was printed (n.s., I, 24), apparently incited an angry reply from Dawes; Simms treated this answer humorously in his satirical essay entitled "'The Baltimore Minerva and Emerald,' ads. 'Ourselves,'" in which he conducted a mock trial, with Dawes the plaintiff and Simms himself the defendant. The verdict: not guilty on all counts. In conclusion Simms wished "friend DAWES. . . . all manner of success" (n.s., I, 216). A unique feature in the Gazette is the cutting criticism of Simms's poetry by a correspondent who signed his name "Massachusettensis." A letter to the editor explains how Simms found himself in the unusual position of printing in his own magazine a castigation of his own writings: Our Own Poetry ! MR. EDITOR—I take advantage of the general conduct of your Journal to require the publication, in the coming number, of the enclosed strictures upon your own writings. I am perfectly satisfied you will not be heartily willing to do this, but as you are pledged to its insertion (How unfortunate — ED.) from the nature of your prospectus and the general plan of your work, I am determined that you shall partake of a little of that crabstick which you are so much in the habit of applying to the shoulders of others. It may be suggested that it would have been quite as well to have made use of some vehicle other than your own, in which to give publicity to my strictures upon you; I reply — It is my pleasure — I prefer that you should minister to your own punishment (what an excess of cruelty in the art of torture. —ED.) through the medium of your own Gazette. I ask with Shylock, 'are you answered yet?' I shall expect to see this article in your next, (in a great hurry. — ED.) and am not very apt to put up with a disappointment of any kind. MASSACHUSETTENSIS Immediately below appears the stinging critique in which such phrases as the following abound: "author of small wares," "effusion of youthful prurience and puerility," "foolish and weak favor of a few of his friends," "pertinacious determination of the author, still to thrust himself before the community," and "three volumes of absurd crudities" (n.s., I, 214). Knowing his fun-loving nature, one wonders if Simms did not contrive the whole scheme in an attempt to draw attention to his poetry by obviously exaggerating its faults. Simms must have known that an attack upon anything Southern by a person styled "Massachusettensis" would have enlisted the support of patriotic South Carolinians. At any rate, " Our Own Poetry! " doubtless made good reading for the subscribers to the Southern Literary Gazette . In the essay entitled "Letters in America" in the second number of the new series, Simms summed up his views on some of the chief faults of American literature. The thing that he insisted on most in the establishment of a national literature was independence — independence from English fashion and English taste. The black picture of American letters is nevertheless tinged with the color of hope: There are few, if any, inducements to authorship in America. Neither fame, nor profit result from the pursuit. Without a writer consents to minister to the public taste, ruined by the English Press, in the manner of Scott or Cooper, models, for the proper study of which, he is most commonly unfitted, his bookseller will be terribly in errere at the close of the season. This fact has produced the multitudinous trash, denominated Novels and Romances, with which the American Press, for the last five years has been inundated. Of even more concern than the degraded literary taste of the American people was their continued dependence upon England for guidance in literature and criticism. "We have it on the authority of an American writer of some celebrity," Simms wrote, "that the Messieurs Carey and Lea, (the most intelligent and respectable booksellers and publishers we have . . .) have asserted that with the exception of one or two . . . , no work of American origin will pay its expenses, unless previously spoken of in some of the British Journals or Reviews ." Will our fellow citizens [Simms concluded] dare pretend to Independence after this? How can we presume to say that we have shaken off our national vassalage, when this most dishonorable and degrading badge of servitude is hung about us, when we dare not presume to venture an opinion of our own, until we have received the sanction of our former master . . . . We can never be great or independent until we have shaken off every trace of foreign bondage . . . (n.s., I, 46). Perhaps it is fitting to close with an excerpt from Simms's "Diablerie — No. 2," in which he good-naturedly described an event that must have occurred all too often during the thirteen months that he sat in the editor's chair of this early Charleston literary periodical: This morning being the twenty-eighth of July, and the 1st of August near at hand, (the day on which we have proposed issuing the present number of our Journal,) out sallied our printer and publisher to seek our person, in much wrath and tribulation. All our communications had been exhausted by our over large pages and over small type: and we had accordingly set to work, in the hope of gleaning from the 'living spirit' a portion of that celestial combustible, which was to inflame us with the glow of inspiration, and authorship. Our once prolific fountain was, however, quite at a stand; it lay sluggish and dormant as a 'mantled pool;' it no longer bubbled and brightened over, but crept away among the pebbles and gravel; too many draughts had completely exhausted and left it barren. . . (n.s., I, 143-144). Of Simms's contributions to the Southern Literary Gazette it may be said that some are remarkably good — some trash. Much of the material was later reworked and published in other magazines or in books. In general, the prose — whether fiction or criticism — is superior to the poetry, although, as has been stated, a few individual poems stand out. But it is Simms the critic who is best revealed in the pages of the Southern Literary Gazette ; and despite his youth and inexperience, he emerges as a surprisingly sound and mature judge of literature. Yet until recently his criticism had been almost completely overlooked. 42 But before one comes to a settled conclusion on the accomplishments of this highly productive young editor, he should remember Simms's own dictum: "As long as the Editor is compelled, as we have frequently been, to write one half of his book himself, one half of what he writes, must be trash" (n.s., I, 80).

Postscript After "William Gilmore Simms and the Southern Literary Gazette " had been in page proof, the long missing November 1, 1829, number of the Southern Literary Gazette was discovered by a graduate research assistant, Mr. James E. Kibler, Jr., among uncatalogued materials in the Kendall Collection of the South Caroliniana Library. In a brief supplementary article in the next volume of Studies in Bibliography I shall examine the significance of the discovery of this apparently unique copy, containing (as Simms and the Charleston Courier had said it did) the "Confessions of a Murderer," which will be included in Simms's Stories and Tales , scheduled for publication in 1968 in the Centennial Edition of Simms.

Ridgely, William Gilmore Simms (1962), which centers upon Simms's fiction, makes only brief reference to his editorial work. 3 John C. Guilds, "Simms's First Magazine: The Album ," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 169-183; and "William Gilmore Simms and the Cosmopolitan ," Georgia Historical Quarterly , XLI (1957), 31-41. 4 Simmons (c. 1790-1858) had the following publications to his credit in 1828: Blue Beard (1821), Manfredi (1821), Julian (n.d.), and Valdemar, or The Castle of the Cliff (1822). His later writings include DeMontalt, or the Abbey of St. Clair , presented in the Charleston Theatre, February 2, 1843 (see Magnolia , n.s., II [March, 1843], 208) and The Greek Girl (1852). At one time Simmons was connected with the New York Mirror . 5 See Album , I (August 20, 1825), 61-62. 6 Note, however, that "The Tablet" was to include "Political subjects," which had been neglected by the Album . The South's great interest in politics, increasing in 1828 because of the impending nullification crisis, probably accounts for this change. The fact that the editors once referred to the Southern Literary Gazette as "our monthly salmagundi" suggests that they consciously modeled their magazine upon Irving's journal. See Southern Literary Gazette , I (November, 1828), 187; hereafter referred to by volume and page number in text. 7 The Southern Review had been founded by Stephen Elliott in February, 1828. Guy A. Cardwell has written that the Southern Literary Gazette "doubtless suffered . . . by comparison with the extravagantly admired Southern Review which was published at the same time" ("Charleston Periodicals, 1795-1860: A Study in Literary Influences, with a Descriptive Check List of Seventy-five Magazines" [Univ. of North Carolina dissertation, 1936], p. 307). 8 City Gazette and Commercial Daily Advertiser , June 27, 1828, intermittently through September 6, 1828. Despite the fact that in both prospectuses the proposed work was termed "The Tablet," the magazine was actually issued as the Southern Literary Gazette . 9 P. M. S. Neufville was the first printer of the Gazette , though the publishers seem to have been W. H. Barrett and S. &amp; R. Babcock, booksellers. See the Courier , September 10, 1828. A. F. Cunningham, 36 Queen St., became printer and publisher at the commencement of the new series. 10 Courier , September 10, October 19, 1828; City Gazette , September 23, 1828. 11 Despite the editors' good intentions, however, the December number appeared so late that it was finally issued (apparently on the fourth or fifth day of January) as a combined December-January number. See Courier , January 5, 1829. 12 See also the City Gazette , February 14, 1829; and Courier , November 15, 1828; January 5 and February 2, 1829. 13 Unless, of course, as has been conjectured, the "Society of Young Gentlemen" is simply a pseudonym Simms assumed as the lone editor of the Album . See Guilds, "Simms's First Magazine," pp. 171-172. 14 The prospectus is printed on back of the title-page of the entire volume containing the new series (n.s., I, 2). The Critic , founded in November, 1828, by William Leggett, met with so little success that after six months of publication it was combined with the New York Mirror . 15 The London Literary Gazette; and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp; c. was founded in 1817 by William Jerdan, who served as its editor until 1850. In 1828 the weekly issues contained sixteen large pages divided into three columns. The section entitled "Review of New Books" usually occupied the first eight of these sixteen pages, the last two of which were devoted to advertisements. The magazine survived until 1862. See Walter Graham, English Literary Periodicals (1930), pp. 315-316. 16 Courier , August 29, 1829. 17 The Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette is not listed in The Union List of Serials , 3rd edition, ed. Edna Brown Titus (1965); nor was a tracer sent through the Library of Congress able to locate a copy. 18 In defending himself against the charge that Martin Faber had been modeled upon Miserrimus , a novel by F. M. Reynolds also published in 1833, Simms stated in 1837: ". . . the chief incidents of the former work were first published in the Southern Literary Gazette, a periodical put forth in Charleston, South Carolina, about seven years ago. It filled some eight or ten pages in the second volume of that journal. . . . From the paper entitled, "Confessions of a Murderer," the work was subsequently elaborated — partly in 1829, partly in 1832, and finally revised for publication in 1833, when it appeared in its present form" ("Advertisement to the Second Edition," Martin Faber, the Story of a Criminal; and Other Tales, 1837, I, xi-xii). Because of the confusing numbering of the volumes of the Southern Literary Gazette , it should be noted that in the discussion that follows, "second volume" or "second series" is synonymous with "new series, volume one." 19 See Frank L. Mott, A History of American Magazines, 1741-1850 (1930), p. 382; William Stanley Hoole, A Check-List and Finding-List of Charleston Periodicals, 1732-1864 (1936), pp. 31-32; Union List of Serials . . . , IV, 3374; V, 4019. 20 "The Stories of William Gilmore Simms," American Literature , XIV (1942), 26n. 21 It should be noted, too, that the prospectus ran in the Courier until November 7, 1829, the day on which the magazine was first and last issued. Simms and Burges would hardly have allowed the prospectus to continue to appear unchanged if the plans for their journal had been changed. 22 William Henry Timrod (1792-1837), minor Charleston poet, was the father of Henry H. Timrod (1828-1867). See Jay B. Hubbell, ed., The Last Years of Henry Timrod, 1864-1867 (1941), pp. 165-178. 23 This figure, of course, does not include anything Simms may have published in the single issue of the Pleiades and Southern Literary Gazette , or in the twelfth number of the new series — if such a number did appear. At least it is known that the "Confessions of a Murderer" is contained in one of these two numbers; thus Simms's contributions number at least 102. In addition, the Courier of October 29, 1829, announced "Chronicles of Ashley River — No. 6" for the elusive twelfth number. For a listing of Simms's known contributions, see Appendix, below. 24 For evidence for the various attributions, see Appendix. 25 Albert Keiser, The Indian in American Literature (1933), p. 296, says that Simms's estimate of the Indian is "probably the most balanced" in American literature. See Simms's essay, "Literature and Art Among the American Aborigines," reprinted in the John Harvard Library edition of Views and Reviews in American Literature, History and Fiction , First Series (1962), 128-147; first published as "Literature and Art Among the Indians" in the Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review , I (March, 1845), 153-164. 26 The fact that Poe left Charleston on December 11, 1828, and that the December Gazette (in reality a combined December-January number) apparently was not issued until January 4 or 5, 1829, means, however, that Poe would not easily have come upon a copy unless he was a subscriber to the magazine. See William Stanley Hoole, "Poe in Charleston, S. C.," American Literature , VI (March, 1934), 78-80; Courier , January 5, 1829. Since the Southern Literary Gazette was the only "literary" journal in Charleston at the time, the chances seem good that Poe was a subscriber — or at least a regular reader. There is no evidence, however, that he contributed to the Gazette . 27 See John C. Guilds, "Poe's 'MS. Found in a Bottle': A Possible Source," Notes and Queries , n.s., III (1956), 452. "A Picture of the Sea," which is unsigned in the Gazette , was later revised by Simms and published under his own name in the Southron , a magazine edited by his friend Alexander B. Meek. See "A Story of the Sea," Southron , I (June, 1839), 329-335. 28 For example, in "The Cypress Swamp" appears the following sentence: "A heavy plunge from a bank to which we were approaching gave us the first indication of an approximation to an alligator of the largest class; while the phosphorescent qualities of the disturbed water, as it bubbled up from the interruption, flashed vividly and strangely upon our eyes" (n.s., I, 212). This passage was condensed and altered by Simms to read in The Partisan : "Sometimes a phosphorescent gleam played over the stagnant pond, into which the terrapin plunged heavily at their approach . . ." ( The Partisan , Redfield edition, 1854, p. 67). Also compare the following statement from "The Cypress Swamp" with Porgy's fondness for terrapin stew ( The Partisan , pp. 371ff): "These terraqueous monsters [terrapins] make a most admirable condiment in the shape of a soup, of which, at different times, we have liberally partaken" (n.s., I, 212). 29 See J. Wesley Thomas, "The German Sources of William Gilmore Simms," Anglo-German and American-German Crosscurrents (1957), I, 130-131. 30 The second installment appeared in March; see I, 287-297, and 366-377. The Criminal become so from lost [ loss ] of honour , translated by L. Wapler from Schiller's Der Verbrecher aus verlorener Ehre , had been privately printed in Augsburg in 1825. See John P. Anderson, "Bibliography," in Henry W. Nevinson, Life of Friedrich Schiller (1889), p. xiii. 31 Simms was probably also indebted to William Godwin, whose Caleb Williams has the same purpose. See Floyd H. Deen, "The Genesis of Martin Faber in Caleb Williams ," Modern Language Notes , LIX (May, 1944), 315-317. Another possible influence is Charles Brockden Brown, whom Simms probably read. 32 See, for instance, Simms's comments in the Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review (1845): on Fouque, I, 436-437; on Goethe and Schiller, I, 432-433, and II, 140. 33 See T. C. Duncan Eaves, "An Early American Admirer of Keats," PMLA , LXVII (1952), 895-898. 34 James Gates Percival (1795-1856) had published Clio I and II in 1822. According to the DAB Percival "remained the ranking American poet until the appearance of Bryant's Poems (1832) . . ." (XIV, 460-461). Simms may have read Hugh Swinton Legare's harsh review of Clio III in Southern Review , I (May, 1828), 442-457. 35 See also n.s., I (May 15, 1829), 24. In n.s., I (August 15, 1829), 159, Simms wrote of Willis: "Our only fear for Willis is that he may be spoiled like Percival, by the injudicious praise of those incapable of judging." The first number of Willis's American Monthly Magazine was issued in Boston in April, 1829. The last issue was that of July, 1831. See Mott, p. 577. 36 The author was James E. Heath, who was in 1834 to become the first editor of the Southern Literary Messenger . 37 For a recent study of Timothy Flint (1780-1840) and his pioneer western novels, see James K. Folsom, Timothy Flint (1965). 38 The title of the book under consideration is Sketches of the History , Manners and Customs of the North American Indians, with a plan for their melioration , by James Buchanan. 39 Actually Simms's trip to Mississippi may have come earlier. In December, 1842, Simms spoke of "traveling in Alabama twenty years ago" (see Guardian , Columbia, Tenn., III [February 15, 1843], 30-31) — a more specific statement than that which appears in the opening paragraph of the address he delivered at Tuscaloosa on December 13, 1842. There is some reason to believe that Simms is the author of "Sketches of Indian Character," which appears in the Southern Literary Journal for October, 1835. The opening sentence reads as follows: "It is now sixteen years since the writer left Charleston on an excursion of recreation in the then wilderness of the South-West" (I, 101). If Simms wrote this article (signed "A Traveller"), the date of his first visit to the Southwest becomes 1819, at which time Simms was only thirteen years old. Such a trip does not seem improbable, however; Simms's father, who had settled in Mississippi, had on several occasions tried to persuade young Gilmore to come live with him. Simms wanted to remain in Charleston, but a trip (accompanied by "a gentleman of fine sense and many accomplishments") to visit his father would have been natural. See also Hampton M. Jarrell, "Simms's Visits to the Southwest," American Literature , V (1933), 29-35; and William Stanley Hoole, "A Note on Simms's Visits to the Southwest," American Literature , VI (1934), 334-336. 40 Harby (1788-1828), journalist and playwright, had at various times been connected with the Quiver , a literary weekly, and with two Charleston newspapers — the Southern Patriot and the City Gazette . 41 Robert Walsh, editor of the American Review (1811-1812), was then editing (1827-1838) the American Quarterly Review . Mott (p. 272) has written of the American Review : "It was largely devoted to politics . . . and particularly to the difficulties with Napoleon." Of the later magazine Mott remarks: "Critics have united to damn the American Quarterly Review by one adjective: dull" (p. 273). 42 See Edd Winfield Parks, William Gilmore Simms As Literary Critic (Athens, Ga., 1961). 1 Republication of contributions, often with extensive revision, is indicated in parentheses.

"Florio" also appears in the Album . 4 "Attica," Literary World , I (April 17, 1847), 252, is signed "Linus." "Attica" also appears in Magnolia , n.s., I (July, 1842), 38, and in The Cassique of Accabee . 5 Simms used "S." as a pseudonym in the Album and in the Magnolia . See also Morris, p. 28n. 6 This poem is dedicated to "Miss F____ S____," of St. Augustine, Florida. Because of the Simmonses' association with St. Augustine, one wonders if Simmons is not the author. 7 Simms used "Pierre Vidal" as a pseudonym in the Magnolia . 8 This poem is included in "Chronicles of Ashley River—No. 3." 9 Ms. of this poem is in the Charles C. Simms Collection in the University of South Carolina Library. 10 Simms had used "M." as a pseudonym in the Album . 11 See The Letters of William Gilmore Simms , ed. Mary C. Simms Oliphant, A. T. Odell, and T. C. Duncan Eaves, 5 vols. (1952-56), IV, 217-218. 12 In the first volume the criticism does not appear under the separate heading, "Critical Notices," as it usually does in the new series. The separate reviews—some of which in the first volume were probably by James Wright Simmons—are too numerous to list by name, but it is certain that Simms was the author of most of them. 13 This list is composed of those writings in SLG which because of matters of style and/or content I believe to have been written by Simms. 14 Attributed to Simms by S.

      <field name="heading_text">James's "Pandora": The Mixed Consequences of Revision by Charles Vandersee *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the fascinating aspects of Jamesian revisions is the fact that any generalization about them is suspect. When Hélène Harvitt compared the 1883 Roderick Hudson with the New York Edition she found that the revisions tended to make the text "heavy, ambiguous, and sometimes almost impenetrable." 1 On the other hand, Albert F. Gegenheimer looked at "A Passionate Pilgrim" and found in three revisions over the years quite the opposite happening. The changes were "distinct improvements," as passages became shorter and ornate language became plainer and more precise. Ambiguities disappeared. 2 One of the most recent writers on Jamesian revisions is S. P. Rosenbaum, who clarifies the "controversy between revisionists and anti-revisionists" by reiterating an important caveat: To study the revisions soundly one must collate all texts of a James work rather than merely check the first edition (or magazine printing) against the New York Edition. 3 For as F. O. Matthiessen had earlier cautioned, James was in the habit of "touching up his texts" whenever a new printing gave him the chance. 4 Most often, however, one's concern is with James's late revisions. For as Matthiessen also points out, the changes "that instruct us in the evolution of his technique" are those that he introduced into a text twenty or twenty-five years after having last printed it. 5 Here the problem is simply to compare the New York text of a work (1907-09) with the text of the most recent prior revision. This, in fact, should be done with all of James's works if we are ever to have a full and definitive understanding of James as conscious artist. Among these works is a relatively minor story of the 1880's, "Pandora," which first appeared in the New York Sun in two installments in June, 1884. Before James revised it for his New York Edition (1909) it had made only two other appearances, in The Author of Beltraffio (Boston, 1885) and in Stories Revived (London, 1885). The three early versions of this story are virtually identical. When James revised the 1884 newspaper text for book publication, he apparently made two separate and unrelated revisions, one for the Boston printing of 1885 and one for the London printing of a few months later. Evidence for independent revisions derives from an analysis of minor verbal differences among the three versions. As an example, Pandora, the "self-made girl," is an "invader" of Count Vogelstein's shipboard reverie in the Sun text. In the Boston text she becomes his "aggressor," while the London text retains "invader" (363). 6 Vogelstein later describes her, in both the Sun text and the Boston text, as "a great beauty and a great belle," but in the London text he calls her "a great beauty and a great success" (385). Similarly, her parents' "extraordinary pilgrimage" to Europe is satisfactory for both New York and Boston, but becomes an "extraordinary odyssey" for London readers (373). Thus James made certain alterations of the New York text for the Boston printing but not for the London printing, and vice versa. The London edition has some forty of these verbal changes from the New York text, twice as many as the Boston text has. As Leon Edel observes, the Boston text had "less supervision by the author." 7 These minor changes typify James fastidiously "touching up his texts," but they have little significance beyond this. Too close a scrutiny, in fact, reveals what one is tempted to call the hand of a whimsical meddler rather than that of a careful craftsman. Seven times, for example, James changed one phrase of the New York Sun text in two different ways for his respective Boston and London texts. In the Sun text, to give an illustration, the New York customs official remarks to alighting passengers that the voyage had apparently "been 'kind of dull'". This happy colloquial touch weakens in the Boston text ("had been 'rather glassy'") and dies completely on reaching London ("had had a good deal of sameness") (376). In a whimsical maneuver of a different kind, James at one point unwittingly wrecked the consistency of details in his text. Vogelstein, at a Washington party, pretends (in all three texts) "to be looking for a cup of tea." In the New York and Boston texts he does indeed find "some tea," and a few lines later (again, in all three versions) "he drank his tea." In the London text, however, it is not tea that Vogelstein picks up, but rather "two ices" — a capricious revision that later places Vogelstein in the position of putting down a cup of tea that he had never picked up (389). Curious and revealing as these small touches may be, they are only the prelude to the subsequent metamorphosis of the tale. In 1909, twenty-four years after the Boston and London printings, James published a volume in the New York Edition which contained a freshly-revised "Pandora." He was now reading the story (in the Boston version) with a generation behind him of perspective and of stylistic development in his art. And he was now revising thoroughly and meticulously, with care rather than with hurried caprice. There are a number of special reasons for wishing to see what James now did with this obscure tale, this "anecdote," as James called it in his Preface. In the first place, and least important, certain of its characters are based on real people. Not the protagonist, to be sure — no one has found a real-life original for Count Otto Vogelstein, the earnest but obtuse German diplomat. Nor is there a known model for Pandora Day, the "self-made girl" from Utica, New York, who is the object of Vogelstein's somewhat restrained attentions. But the Washington host and hostess at the party which throws the two together do come from life. James rejoiced in his notebook that he might " do Henry Adams and his wife," and the urbane Alfred Bonnycastles are the outcome of this notion. Mrs. Adams, however, committed suicide eighteen months after the story's first appearance, and tasteless newspaper accounts at the time reported that she had possessed "a sharp tongue." 8 Would James, therefore, in preparing the New York Edition, somehow play down Mrs. Bonnycastle-Adams? Or perhaps remove her delightfully wicked quips so as to spare the abnormally sensitive Adams any recollection of the savage reports about his wife's wit? A further reason for inquiry into this particular story is given by Matthiessen. "Pandora," he reminds us, is one of only two early stories with American settings that appear in the New York Edition. 9 If only "Pandora" and "The Point of View" fit the congruence of James's grand design, what changes were necessary? What shifts of emphasis, what alteration of detail would the expatriate make as he reread his description of American life? There are, for example, some pages on New York in "Pandora," and James in his visit to America in 1904 had found that city "appalling, fantastically charmless and elaborately dire." And though America in general was "very interesting" and "uncannily delightful," it also left him "transcendently" and "whiningly" homesick for Lamb House. 10 Would these 1904 observations and judgments affect his revisions of "Pandora"? Finally, the story has already had its revisions hastily scanned by Matthiessen, who states his conclusions so tersely as make the serious student curious. Matthiessen observes that James "made no changes in outline or structure, but he enlivened several sentences with brighter details." 11 He then gives four examples. Can this, the reader asks, be all that James did? Do the "brighter details" have any effect on characterization, tone, or mood? Have duller details been excised to make room for the brighter ones? How many sentences are "several"? These various matters deserve careful attention, and we take up the case of Mrs. Bonnycastle first. "Pandora" is the humorous story of a German diplomat who cannot make up his mind to court an American girl until he fully understands what her social position is. James focuses his attention on Vogelstein rather than on Pandora, and he has formally marked off Vogelstein's experience into two parts, which correspond to the two installments in the Sun . The reader first follows him across the Atlantic, and then, after Vogelstein has spent two years in Washington, we rejoin him during a few days there in April. Mrs. Bonnycastle appears only in this second part. She is introduced in both versions of the story as the lady "whose receptions were the pleasantest in Washington" (128). 12 Like Marian Adams, she made her society exclusive; there was "the complaint sometimes made of it that it was too limited, that it left out, on the whole, more people than it took in." Mrs. Bonnycastle is a sarcastic, biting individual who mercilessly chides Vogelstein for failing, after two years, to comprehend the self-made girl: "You Germans may be thorough, but you certainly are not quick!" (148). Conversation with her is a sparring match rather than a leisurely give-and-take. James, in short, conceived her as a foil for the "serious, civil, ceremonious" diplomat. Her role, an exceedingly important one in the story, is that of candid informant. Vogelstein desperately needs someone to teach him the ABC's of America's mysterious social alphabet, and the forthright Mrs. Bonnycastle appoints herself his tutor. Clearly, James, in revising the text, found himself committed to retaining Mrs. Bonnycastle in all her splendid bluntness, all her sprightly arrogance. To have altered her would have been to redesign all the character relationships in the story. For, like most James characters, she is an essential element of his total ensemble — a skewer cannot be replaced by a soup ladle. If the idea ever struck James that Mrs. Bonnycastle was too vivid a portrait (or caricature) of the tragic Mrs. Adams, the New York Edition makes it clear that structural and artistic demands of the story triumphed over personal considerations. If anything, the alterations in Mrs. Bonnycastle make her even more sharptongued and more acidulous than she had been originally. Consider the verbal changes that James made: When spring came (in the 1885 text), she "relaxed her vigilance a little, became humorously inconsistent, vernally reckless" in her social invitations. The New York Edition replaces "humorously inconsistent" by putting a touch of malice in her character: "whimsically wilful" (129). As for her principle of excluding people from her home: In the 1885 text "she perceived differences [in people] where [Vogelstein] only saw resemblances." The revision shows her as elaborately obsessed with her exclusions: "This lady would discourse to him à perte de vue on differences. . . ." (129). On one of the many occasions that Mrs. Bonnycastle laughs in his face at Vogelstein's obtuseness, the revision heightens the mockery in her attitude. Instead of saying that she "stared at him a moment, with her laughter in her face," James tells us that she "launched at him all her laughter" (142). On a similar occasion the revision is from "the explosion of Mrs. Bonnycastle's mirth" to "a renewed explosion of Mrs. Bonnycastle's sense of the ridiculous" (148). Here two things are stressed: the fact that her unkind laughs are recurrent and the fact that Vogelstein himself is specifically the "ridiculous" object of her mirth. Again to stress Mrs. Bonnycastle's perpetual laugh, James in another change adds a significant phrase: "said the lady of infinite mirth" (162) instead of "Mrs. Bonnycastle said." In one of her malicious shafts at German temperament she remarks: "I don't mean anything German and transcendental." The revision changes the relatively neutral "transcendental" into the insulting "moonstruck" (162). The revelation of Pandora's betrothal, which shocks the unsuspecting Count, undergoes certain revisions; the first version reads: He [Vogelstein] did Mrs. Bonnycastle, moreover, the justice to believe that she would not have taken up the subject so casually if she had suspected that she should make him wince. The whole thing was one of her jokes , and the notification, moreover, was really friendly. (Italics mine) In the New York Edition, amplification unmistakably emphasizes the selfishness and even cruelty in Mrs. Bonnycastle's humor: He did Mrs. Bonnycastle moreover the justice to believe that she would n't have approached the question with such levity if she had supposed she should make him wince. The whole thing was, like everything else, but for her to laugh at , and the betrayal moreover of a good intention (162). (Italics mine) And in the final sentence of the story James was unable to resist another Dickensian reiteration of her perpetual laugh. He added in the New York revision the words here italicized. He communicated this news [of Pandora's marriage] to Mrs. Bonnycastle, who had not heard it, but who, shrieking at the queer face he showed her , met it with the remark that there was now ground for a new induction as to the self-made girl (168). One takes the shriek as a laugh; it would be a violation of her character to shriek in sincere sympathy, surprise, or any other feminine emotion. The mocking laughter of Mrs. Bonnycastle is thus one piece of characterization to which James clearly paid deliberate attention. On only one occasion did he weaken the force of her mirth: "Mrs. Bonnycastle stared a moment, in return; then laughed very hard" becomes: "Mrs. Bonnycastle broke on her side into free amusement" (133). In no instances do James's revisions remove or tone down any of Mrs. Bonnycastle's pungent remarks themselves. In moving away from Mrs. Bonnycastle into the various American aspects of the story, we find much the same kind of revisions. Leon Edel has observed that "Pandora" was a tale "as critical of American families and American institutions as James's other international stories." 13 A number of James's revisions help to sharpen and strengthen his criticism. His subject in the story is America seen through the eyes of a foreigner, an inversion of his more frequent international theme, but one which he had already tried out in The Europeans . To make his setting Washington and his protagonist a political figure (secretary of the German legation) was to allow James room throughout the tale for all manner of observations about America. The conscientious Count, like James's grim Teuton of "A Bundle of Letters" (1879), sets about earnestly to penetrate American mores, and James uses details of conversation and experience to construct an image of America. Part one of the story takes Vogelstein, aboard a North German Lloyd steamer, from Southampton to a Jersey City dock. The first mention of America is by way of comparison, in the chauvinistic Count's mind, to his own venerated Germany: Vogelstein "was quite aware, however, of the claims of the United States and that this portion of the globe presented an enormous field for study." In his revision James inserted one word in particular which neatly clarified and focused Vogelstein's image of the United States: it had claims to " economic and other consideration" (98). The image of America in the story is thus initially framed in dollar signs, and the perceptive reader of a later generation is delicately reminded by the author that he has set his tale in the Gilded Age. Published in 1884, the story took place "a few years ago," we read in the first paragraph. A further fact about America, of which Vogelstein has been informed in advance, is that its denizens are "a highly humorous people." And he worries about this, because his own sense of humor is deficient. Here too a subtle alteration provides a different and more disparaging view of America. Removing the warmth that the word "humorous" provides, James tells us in the New York Edition that America was "a society abounding in comic aspects" (98). Thus America is here represented as itself an object of laughter, while the earlier version is ambiguous, suggesting that Americans are both laughing and laughable. This revised emphasis is clearly indicated also in the sentences previous to the one quoted in part. The early text says of Vogelstein: He was an excellent young man, and his only fault was that he had not a high sense of humour. The revised text reads: He was a highly upright young man, whose only fault was that his sense of comedy, or of the humour of things , had never been specifically disengaged from his several other senses (98). (Italics mine) Shortly thereafter the author, deliberately intruding into the story as first person narrator, takes a half paragraph to paint an ugly picture of German emigrants on the ship bound for America. The italicized words, added in the 1909 revision, show how two decades of immigration apparently disturbed James as he looked at America: "They [the immigrants] were destined to swell still further the huge current of the Western democracy" (100). (The women's shawls of 1885 became the "remarkably ugly shawls" of 1909.) One other verbal revision by which James subtly diminished America comes in connection with the Tauchnitz novel which the Count uses to pass the shipboard hours. The book — one can see James smiling — was his own Daisy Miller , and the America-bound Vogelstein had been assured it "would help to prepare him." To this sentence James in 1909 added five words: ". . . for some of the oddities" (102). Among these oddities, in James's mind no less than in his Count's, was the subject of American humor. America's boisterous humor is occasionally alluded to in the story, in ways that make James seem almost like a puzzled anthropologist describing the exotic trait of an aboriginal people. When, for example, Pandora Day's brother utters witticisms in the smoking room, we are told that: Vogelstein, well as he knew English, could rarely catch the joke; but he could see, at least, that these were the most transcendent flights of American humour. In the elaborate revision: . . .he could see at least that these must be choice specimens of that American humour admired and practised by a whole continent and yet to be rendered accessible to a trained diplomatist, clearly, but [i.e., only] by some special and incalculable revelation (113). With much of America's native humor depending on regional dialects and indigenous character types, on comic exaggeration as well as on laconic understatement, it is no wonder that the insular and serious Count felt perplexed. Two minor revisions dealing with Vogelstein's arrival in New York are worth noting for the altered view of America they give. The genial and well-wishing customs officer puzzles the German, but Vogelstein concludes finally that "it was simply the American manner, and it was very amicable, after all." The revision drops the "amicable" and has Vogelstein decide instead that the American manner "had a finish of its own after all" (124). Here, of course, one complimentary idea is traded for another, but there is also a note of surprise added to the Count's reaction: one infers that he had expected to find nothing really "finished" in America. As Vogelstein then strolls out on the dock, James plants a negative idea about America in the Count's mind. Pandora puts him through a hand-shaking ceremony with her parents, and the Count reflects, in the original, "that evidently the Americans, whom he had always heard described as silent and practical, were not unversed in certain social arts." In the revised text his pleasure is replaced by quiet amusement at already observing one of America's comic aspects: the silent and practical Americans "rejoiced to extravagance in the social graces" (125). Vogelstein thus begins to observe at first hand the United States — which in the revised text, with a touch of irony, is three times referred to as "the great Republic" (100, 129, 150). Part two of the story contains fewer of these damning details. When Mrs. Bonnycastle explains to Vogelstein her principles of social exclusion ("her discrimination"), the 1885 edition provides him with no rumination on the matter. But the 1909 text adds: American promiscuity, goodness knew, had been strange to him, but it was nothing to the queerness of American criticism (129). The other minor alterations pertaining to America are as follows: At the Bonnycastle party "the President" of the 1885 text becomes in 1909 "the great man," an ironic touch occurring at the end of a scene which portrays him as a perfectly common, neighborly chap who might have just stepped in casually through the back door (140). In the 1885 text, Pandora, the self-made girl, "was possible only in America — only in a country where certain competitions [i.e., women of sophistication and culture] were absent." The 1909 revision sharpens this rather oblique passage by expanding the scope of America's differences: "— only in a country where whole ranges of competition and comparison were absent" (150). A minor revision in the succeeding sentence adds the italicized words; Vogelstein, as he converses with the Bonnycastles after their party, in the animated stillness, with the fragrant breath of the western world in his nostrils, was convinced of what he had already suspected, that conversation in the great Republic was [1885: United States is much] more yearningly, not to say gropingly , psychological than elsewhere (150). The reflection is more on Vogelstein than on America; he finds Americans harder to understand (and the process of understanding far more capricious) than he had expected. James is adding emphasis to Vogelstein's most characteristic trait, his slowness of perception, which provides much comic irony in the story. Subsequently, James turns "the abnormal homogeneity of American society" into "the abnormal homogeneity of the American mass" (151). The "white, bare passages" of the Capitol become its "bleak bare development." And a few small touches reduce the House chamber to a comic set; the 1885 text: In the lower House there were certain bedaubed walls, in the basest style of imitation, which made him feel faintly sick; there was a lobby adorned with artless prints and photographs of eminent congressmen, which was too serious for a joke and too comical for anything else. 14 The 1909 revision: . . . faintly sick, not to speak of a lobby adorned with artless prints and photographs of eminent defunct Congressmen that was all too serious for a joke and too comic for a Valhalla (153). Likewise the official guide at Mount Vernon takes on a slightly different cast, a more repulsive one: Instead of being a man "with a large beard," he is a "vulgar heavily-bearded man." He has a "whimsical" manner, and "he made a cheerful thing, an echo of the platform before the booth of a county fair [words added 1909], even of a visit to the tomb of the pater patriae ." James's revisions here stress the vulgarity in America's ostentatious veneration of the past (158). But it is a mistake to assert that in 1909 a peevish James came back to his American story and set about deliberately to disparage his native country. What these small changes add up to is something else. True, in some altered passages where James the author speaks, the judgments and descriptions are his own. And they thus may reflect an increase in his disenchantment, a heightened sense of the comic in America. On his visit to America in 1904 he had described Washington as "amusing." 15 But the revisions have as their main purpose a widening of the gulf between the German, Vogelstein, and the inscrutable "great Republic" that he confronts. Vogelstein simply cannot cope with America — with the "self-made girl" or with its other complex phenomena. He has become more emphatically the Vogel , the poor bird pecking in the hard ground of the New World for insignificant worms while the large panorama is lost on him. And his German head is a dense, round Stein ; as both versions of the story tell us, "his mind contained several millions of facts, packed too closely together for the light breeze of the imagination to draw through the mass" (99). To understand the New World required this breeze of the imagination, which Vogelstein could not stir up. And not to understand something is often to dislike it — this is a truism of behavior that applies to Vogelstein. James, in revising, consciously makes Vogelstein more puzzled and consequently less charitable. Vogelstein becomes even more of a type character — the supercilious European — than he had been. It is interesting that this deliberate revision of character seems clearly to be part of a pattern. When we turn to the final aspect of our concern, James's "brighter details," we see at once that Vogelstein is not the only character to become less of an individual and more of a type. We have already pointed to Mrs. Bonnycastle, whose persistent laughter becomes more prominent, a Dickensian trait, in 1909. She becomes less of a real person and more of a Bergsonian comic machine — let the Count stutter an inane query and Mrs. Bonnycastle breaks forth in another spasm of her "infinite mirth." We can also point to another character, almost a pure type to begin with, who is even further caricatured in the 1909 revision. This is Mrs. Steuben, Pandora's chaperone at the Bonnycastle party. In both editions she speaks with a Savannah accent, she has "written verses which were admired in the South," and she wears her dead commodore husband in a "full-length portrait" on her bosom (145). Thus already in 1885 James puts her in the story as a comic figure. When she ungrammatically remarks, "I'm very fond of the old; you know that's a weakness of we Southerners," James sniggers: "The poor lady, it will be observed, had another weakness as well" (146). She is an amalgam of two type characters, the obsolete ante-bellum Southern lady and the self-deceiving poetaster. When James took her up in 1909 he revelled without restraint in making her even more absurd. Her voice in 1885 "had a little flute-like way of sounding the adjective" in the phrase "true, true love." Once in the story was certainly enough for this vigorous Dickensian simile, especially since she occupies little space in the story. But in 1909 James put it in once more: "'Do you think anything's really new?' she then began to flute" (146). Another of her Savannah habits is to pronounce South as "Sooth," to which James elaborately calls our attention: Vogelstein had been struck before this with Mrs. Steuben's pronunciation of the word by which her native latitudes were designated; transcribing it from her lips you would have written it (as the nearest approach) the Sooth (146). In 1909 he expanded this quirk far out of proportion, into the realm of caricature, by additional references: "It's no trouble for a Southerner [1909: "we of the Sooth"] to be quiet" (147). He [Vogelstein] sat there half an hour, and the warm dead stillness of the Washington night — nowhere are the nights so silent — came in at the open window, mingled with a soft sweet earthy smell, the smell of growing things. [1909: . . . things and in particular, as he thought, of Mrs. Steuben's Sooth.] (149) "Why, what do people get engaged for? I presume they will marry before long." [1909: "Why what do people fall in love with each other for ? I presume they'll marry when she gets round to it. Ah if she had only been from the Sooth—!"] (164) The revised Mrs. Steuben also has become more the Southern archromantic: "get engaged" becoming "fall in love with each other." If one goes beyond a mere cataloguing of "brighter details" to draw come conclusions, one cannot help noticing James's deliberate and subtle change in overall tone. The laughter of Mrs. Bonnycastle is emphasized, the rigid thickheadedness of Vogelstein is underscored, the caricature of Mrs. Steuben balloons into the ridiculous. The tone is more overtly comic — a shift from discreet satire into broad burlesque. James is clearly enjoying himself, and is not making the mistake of trying to rescue a trivial piece by elaborating it to literary or thematic significance. Here, however, the question of judgment comes in. Is he going too far in the other direction? Are the new and "brighter" details and the new and farcical tone more successful — given the same characters and situations — than the more gently satiric tone of the old? The answer is likely to be no. One is inclined to fault James for overstatement in the revisions — for trying to turn his gentle comedy of 1885 into overt burlesque, a mode in which his touch is less sure and his manner a bit strained. Nor, by and large, do the revisions in "Pandora" help much to clarify or "brighten" the story. It cannot be said of "Pandora," for example (as Gegenheimer can say of "A Passionate Pilgrim"), that the "substitution of strongly graphic and visual images for other methods of comparison is striking." 16 Nor, in contrast to The Reverberator , do we see James adding dashes of wit and colorful imagery, or "new metaphors, strikingly apt." 17 We have seen how the story as a whole is affected in tone and characterization by certain minor changes. Let us now look briefly at some of the other small verbal changes, which can be arranged in six groups: (1) Revision of single words, often with little or no observable reason or effect. Vogelstein as "curious" instead of "inquisitive" (98). An "aspect" of America to study instead of a "question" (101). A suspicious facial expression "noted" rather than "perceived" (102). "Gathered"/"perceived" (104). "Sought occasion"/"sought an opportunity" (113). National "annals" instead of "history" (153). "Splendid" terrace instead of "magnificent" (154). The diligent student will consult the context and decide for himself whether there is a nuance of difference, but I would argue that he will find one word as good as the other, and the precision of the narration neither improved nor damaged. Hélène Harvitt's query of 1924 is still valid: one wonders in some cases "why he should have preferred one word to another." 18 (2) Revision of single words with minor but noticeable effect. Perhaps most important is the replacing of the straightforward "Vogelstein" with various descriptive epithets: "our observer" (122), "this diplomatic aspirant" (155), "the young man" (157), "her old shipmate" (139), "our special traveller" (155), "her critic" (158), "our young friend" (158), "poor Count Otto" (167). Or — as we leave Vogelstein sadder but wiser at the end — "our silent sufferer" (167). Here, of course, is a Jamesian mannerism, and one can no more beg him to mute the chummy "our" than to ask him to write about Mannlicher rifles and African buffalo. But nonetheless the effect is to make us (uncomfortably, I would assert) aware of the author. It divides our attention between author and characters, and this division has been fatal to lesser writers. No greater precision is achieved; there is only the strained affectation of a false rapport between writer and audience. This increased informality is worth further attention, as it corresponds with the same trait noted by Matthiessen and others as a constant element in James's revisions. Matthiessen calls it a "pervasive colloquialization," 19 and we see it also, in this 72-page story, in the more than 140 contractions that James substitutes: I've, they're, he's, they'll, they've, he'd, I'd. Most occur in characters' speeches, but the revision is wholesale and in some cases ill-advised. James's habitual circumlocutions and his inflated diction simply do not harmonize with some of the folksy contractions in his own narrative voice. (3) "Brighter details" — usually involving an expansion of the thought. "In Washington" becomes "by the waters of the Potomac" (128). A society founded on "necessary lapses"/"fundamental fallacies and triumphant blunders" (129). "Persons of leisure"/"that body which Vogelstein was to hear invoked, again and again, with the mixture of desire and of deprecation that might have attended the mention of a secret vice, under the name of a leisure-class" (130). "All this passed through Vogelstein's mind"/"These images and these questions coursed through Count Otto's mind" (140). "Pandora remarked sympathetically"/"there was a high mature competence in the way the girl sounded the note of approval" (140). Vogelstein remembered that a Dresden lady had called America "a country of girls"/"the country of the Mädchen" (101). Dresden girls "came straight towards one, like that"/"were apt to advance, like this one, straight upon their victim" (104). She looked "like the Queen in Hamlet "/"like the vieux jeu idea of the queen in 'Hamlet'" (145). He asked her if she desired "his seat"/"of him the surrender of his seat" (106). One might give one's self away to people "who afterwards prove a great encumbrance"/ "who would afterwards be as a millstone round one's neck" (114). This millstone is one of the few images that James added to the story — and a rather trite one at that. The most famous expansion through "brighter detail" adds the italicized words to a remark by Alfred Bonnycastle (Henry Adams): "Let us be vulgar and have some fun — let us invite the President" (131). In the examples from this category of revisions it is easy to see that most are extremely felicitous and clarifying. Some also are of questionable value. The wisest of James's revisions fall into this category. (4) Duller details — usually involving an expansion of thought. The lady beside him "was making him laugh"/"ministered freely and without scruple, it was clear, to this effect of his comfortably unbending" (138). Vogelstein had "often, in Washington, been discoursed to at the same moment by several virginal voices"/"so repeatedly heard himself addressed in even more than triple simultaneity" (133). ". . . the girl returned"/". . . the ex-heroine of the Donau returned" (143). "If he spoke to her at all he wished to speak to her alone"/"If he should speak to her at all he would somehow wish it to be in more privacy" (141). The inhabitants of the commercial cities came so far southward "to escape that boisterous interlude" (i.e., spring)/"to escape, after the long winter, that final affront" (136). "She hesitated again"/ "Again she just hung fire" (161). These are items, in short, to add to the arsenal of those who argue that the later James is the hippopotamus painfully trying to retrieve a pea. In fact, however, the revisions that fit this category are rather fewer than those in the category of "brighter details." Thus, generally speaking, in "Pandora" the shade of meaning is attended to by the reviser with considerable care and with success more often than failure. The "hung fire" revision above is, as Matthiessen observes, a "Jamesian favorite," 20 and as such it suggests that precision and felicity were not the only reasons for James's revisions. Instead, a clever colloquialism sometimes became for James an obsession to be used over and over again. (5) Excision of significant detail in a full phrase or clause or sentence. "Vogelstein's servant, an Englishman (he had taken him for practice in the language), had gone in pursuit of an examiner"/"Vogelstein's servant was off in search of an examiner" (123). This is the only instance in the story of James deleting lengthy detail without substituting the same idea or a subtly altered idea in different phrasing. (6) Addition of significant detail in a full phrase or clause or sentence. In addition to the several examples already cited above in other contexts, there are the following: American ladies "in striped shawls, though in prettier ones than the nursing mothers of the steerage " (100). "Differences, however, were notoriously half the charm of travel[.], and perhaps even most when they could n't be expressed in figures , numbers , diagrams or the other merely useful symbols " (101f.). "'Our name is Day'"/"'Our name's just Day — you might n't think it was [ was in italics] a name, might you? if we did n't make the most of it ," (106). Numerous other instances are available, showing that James tended to add rather than delete, which is quite to be expected in a quest for nuance and clarification. We may finally sum up the nature of the revisions by reiterating that tone and detail are the two main aspects of the story affected. In tone the achievement is dubious — a warped veneer of the colloquial that does not bond well to the basic formality of syntax and diction. There is also a debatable shift from one region of the comic to another: from subtle satire to broad farce, a shift which the individual reader can contemplate according to his own standards of comedy and of Jamesian art. In the matter of details, we find extensive minor alteration, usually expansion for the sake of clarification and addition of meaning. Most of these revisions work nicely, but some few stand out as evidence for the prosecution. So in this particular story the net result is neither striking improvement nor fatal tampering. The story is better in some ways, worse in others. But it is different — one cannot assert that the changes really add up to nothing. The care with which James went through his "anecdote" word by word and thought by thought is convincingly demonstrated by one particular revision in the second half of the story. Seven pages from the end Mrs. Bonnycastle has occasion to warn Vogelstein not to fix his affections on Pandora, the "self-made girl," because, as she puts it (in both versions), "she's always engaged to some young man who belongs to her earlier phase." Vogelstein inquiries what an "earlier phase" might mean, and in the 1885 version Mrs. Bonnycastle answers simply: "The time before she had made herself — when she lived at home." When James in 1909 revised her response he could look back at his whole gallery of self-made girls, whether self-made in the social or the ethical sense: Isabel Archer, Milly Theale, Maggie Verver. He could also look at the achievements of modern women in real life, as his friend Henry Adams had stood in awe of Mme Curie and her ominous radium. All opened odd Pandora's boxes, finding not evils but their own latent powers and perceptions, just as Pandora Day, whose last name evokes her brightness and candor, had opened the lavish box of American opportunity. Whatever went through James's mind, there is no faulting the wisdom in his revision of Mrs. Bonnycastle's response. Fraught with meaning for the story and for the age, her response to the Count's query, "Her earlier phase?" now reads: "The time before she had made herself — when she lived unconscious of her powers" (162).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The 1966 centennial of the first photo-facsimile of an early English printed book is a convenient occasion for a survey of these aids to the study of English literature and culture in the period before 1641. The probability that the next few years will produce a flood of them makes 1966 a convenient cut-off — though in fact the present Check List includes a few from 1967 programs. The usefulness of facsimiles is generally conceded, and the danger of naive reliance on them is often mentioned. Everyone is grateful that they make minor texts available. They also enable students to realize the general appearance — the "feel" — of early books and to do elementary bibliographical study without wear and tear on the scarce originals. 1 Wear on fragile originals is indeed a valid concern: as far back as the 1930's the Huntington Library prepared an extensive series of photostats of its chief rarities so that scholars can use them for casual or incidental reference — of course the originals are produced when needed. Preliminary textual study can be done with good facsimiles, though no one questions the principle that an editor must work finally with the originals. 2 Since this survey views a facsimile as a careful reprint of an individual original copy, there is no reason to argue why facsimiles cannot replace critical editions. Fredson Bowers has lucidly shown the problem — chiefly arising from press correction — of devising a compound facsimile edition from all available copies, 3 and one may hope that his utopian ideal will never be used as a working blueprint. The purpose of photo-facsimiles, then, varies considerably. At one extreme is a simple desire to make a scarce text available without the labor of editing and without the expense — increasingly burdensome — of type composition. Such enterprise is commendable, and one would be boorish to insinuate vanity in collectors and libraries making their treasures thus available to the public. The inexorable laws of Tudor book survival and printing costs coincide to favor reproduction of small pieces (thin pamphlets or broadsides), but there are splendid exceptions, such as Chaucer and Shakespeare folios, Cotgrave's Dictionary , Hakluyt's Navigations , and the King James Bible (Geneva version is in planning stage). At the far end of the motivational spectrum is the idea of making material available for serious textual criticism, like Harris Fletcher's Milton or numerous Shakespeare titles (a model example is Folger Library's collotype of its unique and previously unused first quarto of Titus Andronicus ). Numerous in trade names and technical details, the processes of photo-facsimile reproduction fall into two practical groups. 4 On one hand is the expensive method — collotype and rival systems — giving the full tone of the original, including damp-stains, dirt, scribbling, paper-texture, etc., though seldom showing watermarks. Cheaper are the black-and-white systems like photolithography which, for readability, usually eliminate all features of the page except the type impression. There is nothing in either sort of reproduction to force or to prevent retouching of negatives or plates, but the sin of "cleaning up" — with resultant loss of stray letters or punctuation — is in fact commoner in black-and-white reprints (accounting, among other things, for the notorious errata list in the Yale facsimile of the First Folio). 5 One doffs one's cap to the new Scolar Press, which not only abjures any tampering with the type area, but claims to use a Hinman collator to check each reprint page against the original for complete fidelity! The logic is incontestable; its implementation will be scrutinized. Varieties of facsimiles earlier than the photographic deserve a brief review, especially since vague listing in booksellers' catalogues may confuse the inexperienced. 6 The type facsimile is the most common and, by general consent, legitimate and useful. Here the appearance of an original is approximated in a new setting that may even use the same type font and on occasion may recast special ornaments. The fastidious reproduction of George Herbert's The Temple , published in 1876 by A. B. Grosart, is a superior example. The vogue for such reprints, though not actually the earliest examples, arose from antiquarian interest early in the nineteenth century. The London printer I. Smeeton created the most notorious, for when cheats deleted the minute added imprint, they fraudulently sold them as originals. Of the Smeeton reprints, Thomas Kyd's Solimon and Perseda has a fantastic history: it was mistakenly used instead of the original for the collation in the standard edition of Kyd by F. S. Boas and for John Farmer's collotype facsimile! This Kyd is a careful reprint, and since Greg's Bibliography neglects to give any distinguishing points, nonspecialists may appreciate one: true STC 22895 has a swash N in the terminal FINIS , while Smeeton uses a plain N . Type facsimiles have been a boon to scholarship in the present century. The Malone Society reprints are invaluable, and one can cite Hyder E. Rollins' Elizabethan miscellanies among lesser series. The decades before 1860 produced a few plausible reprints by careful hand-blocking; these are of rarities before 1550, like STC 14435. The method of lithography from hand-tracing was perfected by Edmund Wilson Ashbee. Sponsored by J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, Ashbee executed A Collection of the Early Quarto Editions of Shakespeare in 48 volumes, 1861-1871: "Every single letter has been traced from the originals by hand." Halliwell-Phillipps signed the certificate in each volume that of the fifty copies nineteen had been deliberately destroyed. 7 Ashbee's later facsimiles include about a score of STC books. Since most are clearly traced, one must assume all are, and they are excluded from the Check List. This eliminates the serviceable facsimile of the unique Chatsworth Kynge Appolyn of Thyre — not in STC but now at last safe in the British Museum. Similarly Francis Fry's useful Bible facsimiles, including his 1862 reprint of Tyndale's New Testament, are hand-traced. Indeed, the period 1860-1885 is a distressing twilight age because some facsimiles give no clue to the method of reproduction and accordingly must be ignored. 8 Meanwhile Victorian enterprise had inaugurated the age of true photo-facsimiles. Halliwell-Phillips was a forerunner, for in the late 1850's he experimented with simple photography; for instance, in 1857 he did STC 13073 in ten copies on photographic paper (surviving examples are too faded for use). Valid photo-facsimiles were a by-product of cartographic experiments at the official Ordnance Survey, and the chosen book was suitably the Shakespeare First Folio. In 1861 the noted chess-player and Shakespeare editor Howard Staunton induced the Survey to use its Southampton plant to reproduce the folio from Staunton's negatives of the "Dryden" copy, with understanding that no expense accrue to the Crown. After the Southampton office had photo-zincographed the preliminaries and the first 162 pages of text, the project was dropped. In 1862 the thirty copies were privately distributed. 9 With this background Staunton induced the London firm of Day and Son to do a complete Folio in the rival process of lithography. Published in 1866, this massive volume is a creditable product even by modern standards. The titlepage, the only editorial apparatus, credits R. W. Preston as the photo-lithographer and claims that the Bridgewater and Museum copies are being used rather than the "Dryden" — a curious and unconfirmed change. The volume is relatively common; apart from weight and fragile paper, it is as usable as the Yale facsimile. But since Lee's collotype is superior, Staunton's Folio is subordinated in the Check List. The honored pioneer is Stephen Ayling's 1869 photolith of a thin pamphlet of prayers (20195). The first substantial item is the 1870 facsimile of an annotated 1636 Book of Common Prayer . Like the 1862 Shakespeare, it was produced by the Ordnance Survey. This project, however, was sponsored officially on behalf of a royal commission on the perennial subject of Prayer Book revision (the book was not available to the public). The next notable advance was the familiar Griggs-Praetorius series of Shakespeare quartos, 43 volumes, 1880-1891. The ambitious project was encouraged by the New Shakspere Society and was provided with introductions by Furnivall, Dowden, Daniel, and other scholars of repute. The photolithography was undertaken by William Griggs, succeeded in 1886 by the more prolific Charles Praetorius. While Ashbee's tracings had been offered at five guineas the volume, this photographic popular series was intended for subscribers at six shillings, a price level that could not be maintained. The editing and production are creditable for the period, the bibliographical information reasonably adequate. 10 Nearly a score are included in the Check List as not yet superseded. Far and away the most extensive series before 1967 was launched in July 1907 by John S. Farmer, whose achievement and sins deserve a monograph. Biographical facts about Farmer are few (fruitless appeals appeared in volumes 173, 182, and 198 of Notes and Queries .) Bibliographical facts are innumerable but have not been systematically surveyed. Farmer planned two series, or rather, rival formats. "Tudor Facsimile Texts" for the luxury trade are large in size, interleaved, and provided with brief letter-press prelims, including boastful certificates on the quality and accuracy that are ironic in the light of facts noted below. For ordinary use, "Old English Drama Students' Facsimile Edition" have reduced margins and contain, besides the collotype, only printed labels for both sides of the front board. The labels are occasionally lost and some seem to have been wrong to start with. No one seems to know how many titles were issued as "Tudor," but it is assumed that all appear in the cheaper series. Farmer throws no light on this point in his prospectuses. His final brochure, A Hand List to the Tudor Facsimile Texts (August 1914), is the best point of departure. 11 Here Farmer claims to have issued 184 volumes to a total of nearly 10,000 copies, though his count appears faulty and one listing seems a ghost from confused notes. More than two dozen of the titles claimed were never actually published. The verifiable count of volumes issued is 153, of which eighteen are not STC material (manuscript or post-1640). After rejections for cause, the Check List uses Farmer for 132 STC titles. Generations of students have been justly grateful for the texts Farmer provides; relatively few have been aware of the danger of relying on them as rigorous evidence. When he died during World War I (does anyone know the year?), he departed not to Arthur's bosom but to Bibliographical Purgatory. Souls in Purgatory welcome the fire, and Farmer will not resent a spot-check of his failures, which concern slipshod choice of originals rather than flaws in reproduction. Farmer honestly acknowledged most blunders that he learned about, as is clear in the retrospective Hand List . 12 Unfortunately his sporadic admissions seldom appear in the books themselves, and few students think of consulting the Hand List . An assortment of faults noticed during a rather casual search may serve as warning to users of facsimile reprints in general. To begin with, he unhappily used Smeeton's type facsimile instead of the genuine Solimon and Perseda . Exasperated because he was denied access to the Devonshire plays (which were in negotiation for sale to Huntington), Farmer faked at least three works from previous "facsimiles." He admits two in the Hand List . What is worse, he used Ashbee's hand-tracings, thus vitiating the whole point of a collotype reproduction. Use of the Museum copy of Ashbee's reprint of Jack Jugeler (14837a) accounts for collotype reproduction of BM stamps in a book the Museum never possessed! Other books clearly done from Ashbee are 22314 and 23949 (the former avowed in the collotype label). 13 Readers will forgive a digression to dispose of a ghost variant of the first edition of Richard III (22314) that Sir Walter Greg doubtless solved to his personal satisfaction but neglected to mention in his Bibliography (# 142a). Ashbee and Griggs independently, and Farmer by transfer, all produce facsimiles of this 1597 Richard showing no ¶ initiating the imprint, although one should be there and naturally appears in Greg's collotype. But Greg was using the Museum's Huth copy, while his predecessors used the Huntington (Devonshire) copy, where the badly worn titlepage retains such a faint trace of the ¶ that Ashbee and Griggs apparently overlooked it. 14 Since his attitude toward originals was lax, it is not surprising that Farmer shows little concern for the authenticity of individual leaves. John Rastell's interlude Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte (20723) will serve as a warning. Farmer's collotype gives no hint of imperfection in the Museum original, though his Hand List notes a facsimile first leaf. It is in fact no great secret that four leaves are supplied in type-facsimile on paper watermarked 1800. 15 The collotype of Skelton's Magnyfycence (22607) makes no mention of imperfection in the Museum original, although a Cambridge University shelfmark is visible on the titlepage ( Hand List admits use of three Cambridge leaves). How many fake and substitute leaves appear in the whole series is a nice subject for speculation — the Hand List notes them in at least six other titles, with a different edition being used in one instance (12267). The collotypes are sometimes silent on the original used, or even mistake it (23544 with Dyce stamp in a "Museum" copy, corrected in Hand List ). In at least one instance (24271) Farmer seems to have missed a leaf present in the original. Points of expertise can hardly be held against him: it is not surprising that he errs in designating an edition as first (4973), misdates an edition from a shaved imprint (6181), and mistakes an explicit for an imprint date (1305). In brief, students relying on Farmer for anything beyond a simple study text do so at their own risk. During the present century several libraries and collectors have made rarities available to scholars in facsimile. Outstanding are the reproductions, usually collotype, from Cambridge, Folger, Huntington and John Rylands. More extensive are the various series sponsored by societies and subscription groups. Easiest to describe are the fifteen volumes in black-and-white published 1931-1938 by the Shakespeare Association. The general editor, G. B. Harrison, took an interest in technical problems, and his individual editors, though chiefly interested in intellectual background, usually provide bibliographical data. The Facsimile Text Society of New York, publishing through the Columbia University Press 1927-1942, produced a number of STC books, including useful literary titles absorbed from the London series of the 1920's known as Noel Douglas or English Replicas. The most extensive recent program is Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints, inaugurated in 1936 and still happily active. It has issued many STC items in economic, if not always handsome, reproduction. The original editor, Louis Friedland, did not have bibliography as a strong point, and some of his lapses are mentioned later. After 1948 greater rigor is shown by Prof. Harry R. Warfel, whose management of the series from Gainesville, Fla., deserves greater support from the scholarly world than it receives. The chief lapse of late is a fault of labeling. An overloaded 1957 titlepage begins Sir Thomas Overbury's Vision ( 1616 ), but the facsimile is of an 1808 reprint! The book should have used its spine inscription as title, English Sources of "The Scarlet Letter ," for it is a collection of material consulted by Hawthorne — in brief, a parallel to C. W. Hodell's facsimile of The Old Yellow Book . The year 1939 finally produced a conjunction of the ideal editor and the facsimile concept: Sir Walter Greg issued the first of the collotype Shakespeare Quartos — models of reproduction and editing. The torch has passed to Charlton Hinman, and Oxford University Press progresses slowly — the fourteenth quarto appeared in 1966 and the next is not expected before 1968. Needless to say, the facsimile industry would come to a standstill if all editors observed the scrupulous standards of this series. With photo-offset increasingly used for economy in reprinting trade books, scholarly facsimiles will doubtless multiply. While Shakespeare Quartos and Scholars' Facsimiles continue on their way, two major series were launched in 1966. The lesser seems aimed at the collector market rather than at Academia, and has probably priced itself beyond viability (the assurance that "only 3000" copies will be printed is curious for items selling at $45 and $60). This enterprise is the Bibliotheca Americana of World Publishing Company of Cleveland. The first three issues (incorporating five titles) appeared in 1966 as samples; the prospectus promises many more. These initial issues were handsomely reproduced in Italy on simulated aged paper, in elegant boxed bindings. The set promises to be usable, if arty. A. L. Rowse writes an essay for each title, and Robert O. Dougan provides bibliographical notes that incredibly neglect to identify the source copies. Operating on a much larger scale and with more rigor if less art, the Scolar Press of Leeds initiated the first of several Renaissance series under direction of Dr. R. C. Alston of the University of Leeds. These economic reprints promise to be reliable, though the fastidious may resent the amount of show-through resulting from a declared policy of no retouching. The 1966 program of eleven issues in the "General" series was actually completed early in 1967. The first of an Elizabethan music series under the expert F. W. Sternfeld was scheduled for fall 1967. A staggering "English Linguistics" series was to begin in March 1967. Since subscriptions have closed, it is permissible to mention that institutions paying $6930 over a seven-year span are to receive 365 titles of the period 1500-1800 (of which the even century of STC titles pleasantly include several not in old STC ). In sheer numbers, Farmer has at long last been out-Farmered! While this survey was in proof, Scolar Press moved to Menston, Yorks. This survey of the field may conclude with a summary of desiderata in facsimiles and the rules for exclusion from the present Check List. Apart from integrity and legibility in reproduction, the standards of editing proper to photo-facsimiles are simple and rational, but rarely observed before Greg showed the way and often violated since. Readers should be alert to detect failure to comply with these standards: a. The edition must be clearly identified, and the copy used must exemplify it. If variants exist, attention should be called to them. b. The source copy must be identified by location and, if multiple copies exist, by shelf-mark. This insurance of reliability was often neglected in early reprints and even in some Shakespeare Association issues. It is no less than a scandal that in 1966 Huntington's librarian is silent on this point in the Bibliotheca Americana. 16 c. The editor must insure the integrity of his base copy, noting any imperfections and supplying full details on substitute leaves. Substitution is necessary to fill lacunae and in theory permissible to remedy smeared or faint impression; substitutions should be of the same proof state of the forme if possible. Violations were liberally illustrated from Farmer, and more recent examples may be cited. Among early issues of Scholars' Facsimiles, Palladis Tamia (17834) draws on three copies and nevertheless reproduces a crude pen-facsimile titlepage! The Beggers Ape (18516) submitted the titlepage from a shaved Museum copy and thus — without editorial notice — appears without date! Good copies were available at Folger and elsewhere. 17 Clarity surmises that the nominal editors had no control over the actual reproduction. On the other hand, the editor of Cotgrave (5380) has no qualms in admitting that he supplies his last five leaves from a later edition. d. A facsimile reprint should be bibliographically complete, with notice of blank leaves regardless of their presence in the base copy. If it is not complete, clear statement must be made of the omissions. Criminal in this respect is the handsome reprint of Tusser's Good Husbandry . To save precious library time in Britain, the present writer relied on this reprint instead of the unique Museum original. It was years before he accidentally discovered that the reprint silently suppresses the dedication leaf! One may resent the economy omission of sigs. Pp8-Xxi from the reprint of DuBartas (21649), but at least the fact is clearly stated. e. Besides stating the type of reproduction used, an editor may helpfully clear up blurred readings. f. The presumption is that a facsimile is the same size as the original. Marked enlargement or reduction should be noted, with scale or original measurements. Serious reduction may make a reprint almost useless. The present Check List is limited to photo-facsimiles produced on some variety of printing press. Normally they were for general sale, although a minority were privately issued. Some editions were all too limited, so that copies seem as rare as originals. Without impeaching the value of such material, the Check List ignores the following: a. Photographs and photostats . These include invaluable material, such as the corpus available in bound form from Huntington Library, or Americana series published years ago by the Massachusetts Historical Society. b. Microfilm . c. Xerox codices . Normally made to order, these in some instances now approximate books-in-print. Nevertheless they are individually made from microfilm. This census of the output of the British press before 1641 deliberately excludes certain categories, including two failing to qualify for STC under its rules: 1. Books printed abroad in Latin, such as More's Utopia (facsimiled 1966 at Leeds) and Harvey's De Motu Cordis , 1628 (several tercentennary reprints). 2. Single-sheet engraved maps and prints (see A.M.Hind, etc., Engraving in England , I-III, 1952-1964). The complier has further eliminated well over a hundred items on pretext that their doubtful interest to literary students does not outweigh the economy of reducing the Check List by 25%: 3. Indulgences. A fairly complete collection of 45 is crudely but usably reproduced by K. W. Cameron in The Pardoner and his Pardons (Hartford, c.1965). 4. Proclamations. Stray examples are facsimiled in many places. The chief collection was edited by Richard Garnett as Tudor Proclamations , unhappily restricted to 24 copies (Oxford, 1897). 5. A few other documents and blank forms, such as the herald's summons reproduced by Charlton Hinman in The Printing of the First Folio (1963), I, 25. 6. Bookplates (see Egerton Castle, English Book-plates , 1892). 7. A few non-literary fragments, as of almanacks or a leaf of grammar ( STC 7018). After these various exclusions, the Check List comes to just over 500 items. Each was personally inspected by the writer during 1966-1967 except a few still in press when the census was completed. All but a score were seen at Folger Library. 18 It is impossible to assert that scattered reproductions of broadsides may not have escaped the net, but the census of facsimile books is substantially complete. This statement is hazarded on the authority of thirty years of continuous work with STC books. When more than one satisfactory facsimile exists, the best is given primary listing. Others are cited more briefly on the next line. Such duplication is uncommon except for Shakespeare. Listing is by STC number — that is, alphabetical. Information is abbreviated to the facts essential for precise identification of the original edition and for tracing the facsimile. The following sigla are appended to STC numbers: * Title not in original (1926) STC † This edition not in original STC var . Variant imprint from STC or other minor variation pt .

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 A teacher develops chicken-and-egg doubts whether students can use facsimiles before studying originals. Thus it seems impossible to convince M.A. students that the imposition in facsimiles rarely matches the originals. Alan Burns deserves credit for stressing this point in the foreword (p. vi) to the recent Hakluyt ( STC 12625). 2 Though elementary, the handiest summary is Laurence A. Cummings, "Pitfalls of Photocopy Research," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , LXV (1961), 97-101. He is more concerned with film and photostat than printed facsimiles, and with good reason: the slapdash "editing" of early reels in University Microfilms makes the faults noted in this study fade into insignificance. 3 "The Problem of Variant Forme in a Facsimile Edition," The Library , 5th ser., VII (1952), 262-272. 4 Not widely available because privately distributed, the most useful survey of techniques, complete with sample pages, is G. B. Harrison's Facsimile Reprints (London, ?1931), a paper read at the 1931 Anglo-American Conference of Historians. One supposes this a by-product of Harrison's work with the Shakespeare Association series. 5 The earliest facsimile errata list I have noticed is a disturbing yet reassuring feature of the Griggs-Praetorius quartos. 6 See A. W. Pollard, Redgrave, Chapman and Greg, "'Facsimile' Reprints of Old Books," The Library , 4th ser., VI (1925-26), 305-328; also, Allen Hazen, "Type-Facsimiles," Modern Philology , XLIV (1946-47), 209-217. 7 Pollard, op.cit. , p. 312, notes that more copies were lost by fire in 1874 so that surviving sets are indeed scarce. Ashbee does not identify his originals, but some were obviously Devonshire-Chatsworth-Huntington. 8 To my astonished delight, some major problems are solved in George Bullen's Catalogue of the Loan Collection for the 1877 Caxton celebration, pp. 218-219. Thus we learn that Rae's fine 9348 and Tupper's 5057 are tracing-lith, while Blades's elegant 6826 is photo-lith. Check List policy is to omit items that are in doubt. 9 Giles E. Dawson points out to me that the Folger copy belonged to Gilbert R. Redgrave and contains letters he solicited in 1925 to document the Pollard-Redgrave article previously cited (note 6). 10 Of some, if not all, a few copies were printed on vellum. Stray quartos on vellum without identifying prelims will prove of this origin. 11 I had the advantage of using a Folger copy annotated by James G. McManaway, but naturally he is not responsible for any errors in my figures. 12 Farmer artlessly cites the complete unreliability of his own earlier letter-press edition of STC 25982 as reason for buying his collotype ( Hand List , p. 47). 13 Farmer apparently used stray leaves by Ashbee in some other issues (e.g., 12212). He seems not to have worried about copyright. 14 Miss Elizabeth Fry of the Huntington staff kindly verified for me the existence of the vestigial ¶ in the HN. copy. 15 I recall examining these substitute leaves as long ago as 1934 at the suggestion of Prof. B. J. Whiting. 16 It may be lots of fun, but why should editors require readers to exert the detective skills that enabled J. H. P. Pafford to identify the Guildhall copy of the First Folio as that used in the 1910 Methuen facsimile? See Notes and Queries , CCXI (1966), 126-127. 17 Prof. B. M. Wagner kindly inspected the British Museum copy for me. 18 Acknowledgments are due to the Library of Congress, Harvard Library, British Museum, and Miss Eleanor Pitcher.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Compositor B, The Pavier Quartos, and Copy Spellings by William S. Kable</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Printed books are the chief textual witnesses for the majority of Renaissance English literature. Lacking authorial manuscripts, our knowledge of the words from the author's pen comes to us through the medium of print. Modern bibliographical researches have only begun to explore fully the possibilities of reducing this distance between the author's pen and the extant printed text by investigating the process by which the author's words reached print. In this beginning, however, the printing house compositor has already emerged as a significant factor in the transformation of manuscript into printed text. Compositorial study concentrates on the identification and evaluation of the work of these men, and a comprehensive spelling analysis is one of the first necessities in any thoroughgoing compositor study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. In June 1920, Thomas Satchell announced the discovery of two distinct spelling patterns which indicated the presence of two identifiable compositors involved in the setting of type for Macbeth in the First Folio Shakespeare. Satchell named these compositors A and B and outlined their significant spelling patterns based on his researches in Macbeth . Compositor A was recognized principally by the spellings doe , goe , and here ; Compositor B, by do , go , heere . 1 E. E. Willoughby extended Satchell's identification of A and B to other parts of the Folio and suggested the hypothesis that "since in the portion we have investigated there are many passages that are not characteristic of either of them [A and B], it seems probable that there was also another pair of compositors at work." 2 Alice Walker attempted a start at assessing the quality of the work of A and B with special reference to I Henry IV , but little real progress was made at refining compositorial study in the Folio until Charlton Hinman undertook his exhaustive study of the many copies of the Folio at the Folger Shakespeare Library. 3 Hinman's use of type and case identification added a new dimension to compositor study in the Folio. In 1957 he was able to announce the discovery and isolation of a fifth, apprentice, Compositor E, whose work had clouded the picture in the Tragedies. 4 Until Hinman was able to demonstrate the presence of this fifth compositor on the basis of indisputable physical evidence, the similarity of E's most important spelling habits to those of B had caused investigators to assign E's work to B. The coincidence that do , go , and heere were both B's and E's preferred spellings of these words delayed the separation of their work until Hinman's new approach was applied to the problem. Publication of Hinman's completed study of the printing of the Folio provides the first step toward a complete investigation of all five Jaggard compositors involved in setting type for the Folio. 5 His findings in respect to the three key words for compositor identification can be summarized as follows: Compositor A — doe, goe, here Compositor B — do, go, heere Compositor C — doe, goe, heere Compositor D — doe, goe (with tolerance for do and go found in copy), here Compositor E — do, go, heere (with early tolerance for copy spellings) With the exception of E, who joined Jaggard's staff only in the later stages of work on the Folio, Compositors A, B, C and D make up a four-man staff which could be expected to carry out the composition in Jaggard's shop under normal conditions. Much work still remains to be done to produce an exact basis for identifying C and D in the Folio, and qualitative evaluation of all five compositors is needed. The above listing of do , go , here habits does, however, give the basic means of identifying those workmen who can be hypothesized to have made up Jaggard's compositorial staff during the setting of most of the Folio, and that listing can be used as a provisional limit to Jaggard's compositorial staff. 6 The ten Shakespearean and pseudo-Shakespearean plays which make up the group called the Pavier quartos were stumbling blocks to bibliographical and textual researchers before the discovery and demonstration in 1908-1910 that they are all simple page-for-page reprints produced in Isaac Jaggard's shop for Thomas Pavier in 1619. 7 Several of these reprints had even been incorrectly identified as the true first editions of their texts on the basis of substantive variants. The following table lists the Pavier titles and the copy from which they were set. The printers' names are appended to the list of copy to show the diversity of copy which served for the Paviers. 8 Pavier Texts Greg # Copy Printed by: 2 Henry VI 119(c) Q1(1594) Thomas Creede 3 Henry VI 138(c) O1(1595) Peter Short Pericles 284(d) Q3(1611) Simon Stafford A Yorkshire Tragedy 272(b) Q1(1608) Richard Bradock The Merchant of Venice 172(b) Q1(1600) James Roberts Merry Wives of Windsor 187(b) Q1(1602) Thomas Creede King Lear 265(b) Q1(1608) Nicholas Okes Henry V 165(c) Q1(1600) Thomas Creede Sir John Oldcastle 166(b) Q1(1600) Valentine Simmes Midsummer Night's Dream 170(b) Q1(1600) Richard Bradock(?) After the initial argumentative flurry over the identification of the true nature of the Pavier quartos, Shakespearean bibliographical and textual study has in general ignored them or, at best, hastily dismissed them as simple reprints. It is true that there is little chance that the Paviers will produce any startlingly new substantive witness to the Shakespeare text, but since these ten reprints are all products of Jaggard's printing house just a few years before the production of the all-important Folio in that very shop, they offer an excellent opportunity to see Jaggard's workmen dealing with dramatic texts. This opportunity is made all the more significant by the fact that all ten plays are reprints from earlier editions which are extant. The exact copy and the resulting Jaggard text can be compared side by side. D. F. McKenzie pointed the way to the significance of the Pavier quartos in a preliminary study of "Compositor B's Role in The Merchant of Venice Q2 (1619)." 9 Although his spelling tests were based on the word list of Alice Walker, who in turn compiled her list before Compositor E had been distinguished from B, McKenzie's statistics capably demonstrated that Jaggard's Compositor B as recognized in the Folio had in fact set the entire Pavier quarto of The Merchant of Venice . It must be remembered that E, the only compositor who could easily be confused with B, did not enter the shop until 1622. McKenzie was then able to observe exactly what B did with his copy, Merchant Q1 (1600). His study was divided between the few substantive alterations which B gratuitously introduced into the text and a brief discussion of B's "alteration of accidentals." McKenzie did not, however, suggest another important use which can be made of the Pavier reprints and the controls which exist for the study of these texts. In the past, compositorial identification has concentrated on the peculiarities of the workman, on the individual mark which he leaves on the copy he sets. Jaggard's Compositor B, for example, is known primarily for his strong spelling habits, do , go , and heere . Texts set by B are noted for the virtual invariability of these spellings. There is another aspect, however, to compositor study which has been neglected in the concentration on the features of a workman's habits which are his badge and serve to identify him from his fellows. After the bibliographer has determined with assurance that a given compositor did in fact set a given portion of text, the value of the identifying spellings is exhausted. A do , go , or heere in a Folio text may be of use in assigning that text to Compositor B, but its value ends there. In many instances, it would be useful to be able to penetrate the layer of compositorial spellings and go behind the workman to the features of his copy. The study of a new class of words in relation to individual compositors may enable the textual investigator to do just that. These words are those for which the compositor's spelling treatment is recognizable but not so pronounced as to be called an invariable habit. For example, a do in a B text can represent any form of the word ( do , doe , doo ) in his copy. B's strong habit virtually blocks out any trace of the copy spellings for this word. If, however, a new group of words can be discovered for which the compositor does not have an invariable habit, but rather a weak preference or even indifference, these words can then be used, not as identifying marks showing the presence of the compositor, but as a means of seeing through that compositor to his copy. If the compositor has no set preferential spelling for a given word but varies his spellings in some relation to the variations in his copy, the forms of that word in his texts will directly reflect the forms which were in the copy. If the compositor does have some preferential spelling for a given word but is influenced by his copy to set another form from time to time, these occasional occurrences of the non-preferential form(s) will again reveal copy spellings. Once a group of such words can be established for a given compositor, certain projections of expected copy spellings can then be made using the spellings in this new group. Such a projection could be of the greatest possible utility in situations where the copy is unknown, lost, or disputed. The Pavier quartos provide just the controlled situation necessary to make it possible to discover whether this hypothetical group of words does in fact exist within a compositor's total spelling pattern and to establish a broader picture of the nature of compositorial spelling habits, including weak preferences and the cases of relative indifference. First, however, it is necessary to identify the compositor(s) at work in the Paviers. The following tables represent the results of a count of the do , go , here spellings throughout the Paviers. 2H6 3H6 PER YT MV MW KL H5 SJO MND Total Do 45 47 76 15 101 55 98 48 89 102 676 Doe 2 0 11 1 12 1 4 0 1 4 36 2H6 3H6 PER YT MV MW KL H5 SJO MND Total Go 56 16 10 3 41 29 37 20 38 21 271 Goe 5 3 11 5 16 23 21 1 3 17 105 2H6 3H6 PER YT MV MW KL H5 SJO MND Total Heere 57 38 48 11 62 29 38 16 58 32 389 Here 22 11 21 3 15 24 33 8 25 29 191 Although the strength of do and the more or less strong preferences for go and heere seem to point to Compositor B, the real value of these tables lies in demonstrating the dangerous invalidity of overly simplified statistical compilations of spelling evidence. Two important factors have been completely omitted from this set of tables, factors without which no really significant spelling analysis can be made of the Pavier quartos. First, there is no recognition of the copy spellings which lie behind these statistics. For example, the evidence for do (101 occurrences) as opposed to doe (twelve occurrences) in The Merchant of Venice seems at first to conflict with Compositor B's almost invariable do habit. A closer look at this group of spellings with the additional evidence of the spellings of the copy text, however, makes an extremely strong case in favor of Compositor B's having set The Merchant . Of the twelve doe spellings in the Pavier, all twelve reproduce B's non-habitual doe as found in copy, Q1 (1600). Of the 101 do spellings in the Pavier, only five were found in copy and ninety-six represent gratuitous changes of doe to do on the part of the compositor. To state these facts yet another way, the compositor of Pavier Merchant found the word do spelled doe 108 times and do five times in his copy. He reproduced all five do spellings and changed ninety-six of the 108 doe to do leaving only twelve doe forms found in his copy. This additional evidence of the copy spellings overwhelmingly shows the strength of the do spelling in the habits of the compositor who set the Pavier Merchant even though the raw statistics point to a partial use of the doe spelling. This distinction between the raw numerical totals in the first case and the weighted strength provided by the evidence of copy spellings is essentially similar to that between quantitative and qualitative evidence. 10 The quantities of spellings, do (101) and doe (twelve), did in fact point in the general direction of B's habit, but the quality of the evidence only becomes apparent after a review of the copy spellings reveals that ninety-six changes of doe to do are hidden in the raw statistics. Given the relative value of any one change over any one instance of following copy, the quality of the evidence makes the case for B one of certainty. Failure to consider the copy spellings greatly weakens and obscures the genuine evidence. From this example, an important principle governing the study of compositorial habits can be formulated. In compositorial analysis of texts for which the copy is known and available, all consideration of variant spellings must include an examination of the copy spellings. The second factor which was omitted from the first group of tables is that of the influence of justification on a compositor's spellings. It has long been recognized that, as McKerrow said, early compositors "had . . . a means of justifying the lines of type which is denied to modern compositors, namely, by varying the spelling of words." 11 If this is true, and one of the overall results of the examination of the Pavier spellings is to demonstrate graphically the truth of McKerrow's axiom, evidence of spellings in justified lines must be carefully separated from the evidence in short lines. 12 In any given line, the possible influence of justification on the spellings is a matter for debate. The possibility of such influence must, however, cause one to segregate the spelling evidence which could be contaminated by the need for justification. Take, for example, the statistics for go/goe in King Lear . The simple counts record thirty-seven go and twenty-one goe spellings. When the possible effects of justification are taken into consideration, these statistics become go thirty-one times plus six justified occurrences and goe seven times plus fourteen justified occurrences. The original ratio of thirty-seven go to twenty-one goe spellings is rather questionable evidence for B's go as a preferential spelling. When the justified and, therefore, possibly deceptive spellings are taken away, the ratio of thirty-one go to seven goe becomes much more convincing. When this allowance for justification is combined with a consideration of the copy spellings, the total strength of the evidence emerges. Go was found ten times in Lear Q1 (1608), seven times in short lines and three times in justified lines. All ten of these go spellings are retained in the Pavier Lear . On the other hand, Lear Q1 contained thirty-one goe spellings in short lines and seventeen in justified lines. Of the thirty-one long spellings, twenty-four were changed to go . Apparently, therefore, the factor of justification caused the compositor's preference for the short go spelling to be obscured in the justified occurrences of this word. A second principle to govern spelling analysis is that the possible influence of justification on variant spellings must be acknowledged, and spellings in long lines must be separated from other spellings in any statistical compilation. The following set of tables represents a restatement of the evidence for do, go, and here in the light of these two principles. Note that the words are recorded only in relation to copy spellings and that evidence in justified lines is separated from the general statistics. In these tables, J stands for justified, or at least long line, occurrences.

The already small total of thirty-six spellings in the first, overly simplified, tables becomes even more insignificant when it can be observed that of these thirty-six occurrences of doe , twenty-eight (and of that twenty-eight, sixteen justified) reproduce copy spellings. In all ten plays, there are only three non-copy, non-justified doe spellings as opposed to 303 such do forms. The go/goe evidence was not at all clear-cut in the first table but here is shown to be significantly in favor of Compositor B's go . Of the 105 goe spellings in the Paviers, ninety-four (and of that ninety-four, twenty-six justified) reproduce copy spellings. There are only five non-justified, non-copy goe spellings while there are 101 similar go forms. The here/heere ratio was also not clear-cut in the simplified table. With the additional factors considered, however, 169 of the 191 here spellings turn out to derive from the copy used for the Paviers. Of that 169, thirty-two were in justified lines. The thirteen non-copy, non-justified here spellings must be compared with 211 similar heere forms. The total number of B spellings gratuitously introduced into the Paviers is 615. In view of the token number of twenty-one changes in the opposite direction, the presence of B's hand throughout the Paviers is evident. It is also important to note that the few aberrant non-B changes are not significantly grouped, and in no instance do they suggest the presence of another compositor. The examination of the do , go , here spellings in the Pavier quartos shows the special significance of change, that is, the altering of copy in contrast to the following of copy. The spelling pattern of go/goe in A Midsummer Night's Dream is an excellent example of the relative importance of spelling change. The raw evidence in the Paviers is almost evenly divided between twenty go and seventeen goe . The direction of the changes from copy which produced this result tells a far different story. Of the four go spellings in copy, there is not one instance of change to goe . Of the thirty-three goe spellings in copy, however, almost half, sixteen, were changed to go . On the surface, the sixteen changes in thirty-three occurrences of goe might appear to express a certain degree of compositorial indifference to the spelling of this word. When viewed as a part of the overall pattern of B's spellings and in relation to the four go forms, all of which remain unchanged, this change of sixteen out of thirty-three goe to go is far from expressing indifference. Rather, it indicates as strongly as possible the compositor's preference for the go form. A single change is of much more significance in assessing a compositor's preferences than is a single case of his following copy. The sixteen changes of goe to go tell a great deal more about the compositor's preference than do the seventeen instances of following copy. This examination of do , go , here spellings in the Paviers has accomplished two things. First, it has shown the care which must be employed in avoiding over-simplification in the expression of statistical spelling evidence. Spelling analysis must be done in conjunction with an examination, where possible, of copy spellings, and the possible influence of justification on variant spellings must be considered at all times. Secondly, the introduction of these refinements into the analysis of do , go , here spellings has brought convincing strength to the demonstration of the hypothesis that Jaggard's Compositor B did in fact set the whole of the text of the Pavier quartos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Armed with this warning against over-simplification and, at the same time, strengthened by the assurance that B's hand is in evidence throughout the Paviers, I collated all of the Pavier texts against their copy and compiled word counts for over 500 individual words. This mass of statistical evidence was then analyzed in terms of orthographic groups which display significant spelling features. Although I do not wish to reproduce these tedious reports of observed statistics, I propose to give here a list of the groups of words I examined and one sample report in order to make the nature of my study known to those who may be interested in consulting it. 13 The groups of spellings considered were as follows: 1. Internal -A-/-AU- 2. Initial DE-/DI- 3. Internal Consonants: -D-/-DD-, -R-/-RR-, -T-/-TT- 4. Final -D/-DE 5. Initial E-/I- before -N-/-M- 6. Internal -EA-/-EE- 7. Internal -EA-/-EI- 8. Internal -EE-/-IE- 9. Final -E/-EE 10. Final -F/-FE 11. Final -G 12. Internal -I-/-Y- 13. Final -IE/-Y 14. Final -K/-CK/-QUE 15. Final -L 16. Final -M 17. Final -N 18. Internal -O-/-OO- 19. Final -P 20. Final -R 21. Final -S/-SSE 22. Final -T 23. Final -W 24. Final -X 25. Reflexive Pronouns One of the largest of these groups of words is that involving -ie/-y endings. Before one can attempt to generalize about the eighty-eight words in this group for which there is sufficient evidence to permit valid statistical conclusions, they must be examined in sub-groups. First, those words ending in a vowel plus -ie or -y will be considered. After that, the words ending in a consonant plus -ie/-y will be examined in two groups defined by penultimate consonants. All of the following words display B's extremely strong preference for final -y in conjunction with a preceding vowel: away enjoy pay betray joy pray bewray lay say boy may stay day nay way Without exception, B changes -ie and -ye forms of these words to -y and retains all of the -y forms found in copy. The following words ending in -ie/-y after penultimate letters b , c , d , g , k , l , m , n , p , r , t , and v regularly display B's preference for -y endings: b: rugby willingly t: authority c: fancy m: enemy beauty mercy n: any charity d: already company city bloody deny cruelty body honey duty lady many fifty needy money forty ready villany guilty speedy p: happy honesty g: clergy r: beggery liberty k: lucky carry loyalty l: daily contrary majesty dearly country mighty early cry nativity fly dowry necessity heartily every petty heavenly fury pity holy glory pretty kingly history quality only marry safety presently merry thirty princely misery twenty quickly sorry university reply tarry v: envy suddenly very heavy truly victory Preferring final -y for all of the words on this list, B regularly changes the bulk of the -ie forms to -y and almost invariably reproduces the -y forms found in copy. A small and relatively regular percentage of -ie spellings slip through from copy into B's texts, but these carry-overs always occur in conjunction with B's definite preference for -y . There are two consonants which do not fall into the above group and, in fact, display a distinctly contrasting pattern. These consonants are f and s . Defie stands in B's copy six times and all of these six occurrences are reproduced by B. B's copy spells satisfy with final -ie all five times it occurs. B follows copy for all of these forms. Signifie is so spelled in six (+J1) occurrences in copy. All of these forms are reproduced by B. All four (+J1) occurrences of busy are spelled busie both in copy and in B's texts. B reproduces the seven (+J1) curtesie spellings in copy, changes three (+J1) curtesie forms to courtesie , and reproduces three courtesie spellings. All seven easie spellings in copy are retained in B's texts. Heresie is reproduced from copy the three times the word occurs. One heresie form is set in place of copy's herisie . The seven occurrences of jealousy are spelled with final -ie both in copy and in B's texts. Lowsie is reproduced from copy three times and once changed to lowsy . All of the words recorded for f and s plus -ie/-y display an uncanny pattern of strongly favoring final -ie in both copy and B's texts. It is likely that the anomalous -fie/-sie endings result from the use of the fi and long-s/i ligatures. Since all of the Pavier copy produced by various printers agrees with B's use of -fie/-sie in spite of the general -ie/-y treatment, the fi and si ligatures were apparently used with some consistency in order to make the supply of plain f 's and s 's in the case last as long as possible. The unanimity of the printers in following this procedure makes it appear to be a general convention for stretching the supply of type. B displays, therefore, a special tolerance for final -ie after -f- and -s- . It is important to stress the word tolerance because this special feature of B's treatment of final -ie/-y cannot be termed a preference. Without being able to observe B's reaction to -fy and -sy in copy, we cannot equate his use of -fie/-sie with his demonstrable general preference for final -y as evidenced by the majority of the evidence given above. Indeed, the only change in that last group of -f- and -s- is that of one of the four lowsie forms to lowsy . Taken by itself, this shred of evidence points to the fact that B's preferential spelling was final -y but that his tolerance for ligatures with -ie was surprisingly strong. It must also be pointed out that B's tolerance for -fie and -sie is not simply a tendency to give in to copy spellings when they are weighted against his preferences as were the -fie and -sie copy spellings against his general preference for -y . In the group which displays B's preference for final -y , many individual words had large proportions of -ie endings in copy but were consistently set by B with final -y . Happy was found in copy seventeen (+J1) to five in favor of -ie but becomes twenty-two (+J1) happy in B's texts. Victory , guilty , nativity , and thirty were all uniformly spelled with final -ie in copy but with final -y in B's texts. To summarize B's spelling patterns for words ending in -ie/-y , B consistently prefers final -y after preceding vowels and consonants with the exception of f and s . Although his preference for final -y involves both the retention of almost all -y endings and the introduction of -y endings for the vast majority of -ie forms in his copy, a limited percentage of -ie forms is carried over from copy into B's texts. These few -ie forms serve as an indication of copy spellings. For the only exceptions to this general rule, -fie and -sie , B displays an almost absolute tolerance for the -ie endings which are consistently found in copy. An examination of compositor B's group spellings has revealed both the dangers of and benefits to be derived from the use of analogy in the analysis of compositorial spellings. Although compositor identification in the Folio has generally been limited to the use of variant spellings of individual words, other compositor studies have employed classes of words such as that formed by all words with -ie/-y endings. Since investigators have employed these word classes in compositor identification, it is of interest to examine the nature and extent of analogy in the overall spelling pattern of a compositor. There are several large groups of words which B treats in a unified manner. His consistent use of final -e after penultimate -f- is of little significance because the vast majority of copy spellings are also -fe . B's consistent preference for -esse forms of words varying between -es and -esse is an individual habit which extends to all of the similar words recorded in the Paviers. From the evidence of the Pavier spellings, a reasonably safe projection can be made from the uniformity of B's preference for -esse . It is, however, not demonstrable that the very next word examined will not for some special reason depart from the pattern and display the opposite tendency. The discovery of B's clearly defined preference for deere might lead one to expect that B would also prefer the yeere spelling. In fact, however, B's preference for yeare is equally strong as his use of deere . Word classes cannot, therefore, be formed by the use of simple analogy. Although word classes cannot be automatically formed of analogical words, Compositor B's spellings are far from being patternless. Consistent patterns can in fact be observed for groups of similar words. The key to the problem is that the word groups can be formed only after an examination of the individual words. For example, the real pattern of B's treatment of final -ie/-y becomes clear only after considering the individual words. Since the raw statistics indicate that B obviously prefers final -y for all but a handful of words, one's first reaction is to consider B's pattern a general preference for final- y with the tendency to accept a few aberrant -ie endings found in copy. These words might, therefore, be designated exceptions to the general rule and nothing more. When the individual words are analyzed, however, the so-called "exceptions" to the one rule are seen to behave according to a strict rule of their own. All of the words which display B's tolerance for final -ie have penultimate -f- or -s- and are probably governed by the fi and si ligatures. The exceptions to the hypothetical blanket rule are in fact governed by a separate, clearly defined, rule of their own. Only by reasoning from an examination of the individual words is it possible to define accurately the limits of B's pattern. There are many similar situations which show the importance of building up word classes of a more limited sort. Internal -ai-/-ay- spellings appear to be mixed until it is observed that B's spellings split into an -ayle group and a more general -ai- group. In this case, the subgroup displaying -ay- is formed by words having analogous endings. The other group is not governed by any common feature other than the internal -ai- . Internal -r-/-rr- variation, however, falls into two groups, both of which are composed of analogous words. In summary, therefore, Compositor B's spelling patterns indicate that analogy often governed his treatment of various spellings. At the same time, however, untested analogy cannot be employed to define linguistic units for compositor study. The exact nature and extent of these analogous groups must be determined only as a result of the study of separate words. Although analogy must be employed with extreme caution, one important factor, aberration, should not be permitted to interfere with the careful formation of word groups and classes. The Pavier statistics confirm a widely held hypothesis that for some unknown reason a given compositor will on rare occasions contradict even his strongest habit. The point here is that these aberrations should not be allowed to obscure the valid evidence of spelling patterns. In the examination of do , go , and here , for example, B was seen to go against his strong do habit and set doe three times in the course of the Paviers in instances when he was affected neither by the need for justification nor by a copy doe spelling. These three aberrations in the course of ten plays and over 600 occurrences of the word must remain unexplained and be written off as human variability. To take another example, a word first analyzed in the Paviers, the following statistics represent the word count for only . The first column represents copy spellings and the second the spelling of those words in the Paviers. ONLIE — ONELY 1 ONLY — ONELY 12 ONELY — ONELY 33+J2 ONELY — ONLY 1 B's unique aberration in setting only for onely does not have any force against the formulation of the general rule that B's preferential spelling is clearly onely . Although the existence of these aberrations should not be allowed to obscure clearly observable general patterns, the fact that single aberrant spellings occur calls for caution in placing weight on any one individual spelling. To paraphrase Fredson Bowers commenting on aberration in the printing process, the phenomenon of an individual spelling is narrow enough "to introduce the possibility that a recognized . . . [spelling preference] is not being revealed but instead that we are examining only an aberration — some human variation or failure that must be regarded as producing a sport." 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The examination of the Pavier spellings has also produced valuable statistics on many individual words of interest. Spellings which have been proposed by previous investigators as characteristic B spellings are here reviewed in the light of the information provided by the statistics covering B's work in the Paviers. All of the words that have been proposed by Satchell, Willoughby, Cauthen, 15 and Walker 16 as aids in identifying B's work have been observed in the Paviers. None of these investigators considered B's habit spellings in direct relation to copy, and all four of them were working before Hinman's isolation of Compositor E. When reference is make to these spelling analyses, therefore, it must be remembered that E spellings can have contaminated statistics for B. Hinman has commented briefly on the relation of spelling habits to copy. 17 Several other words are included in this section although they are not identifying features for the recognition of B's presence in a given text. These words have been chosen for their special value in indicating other features of B's total spelling pattern and new ways in which spellings can reveal evidence about the compositor's treatment of his copy. 1. been As a part of his attempt to demonstrate that all of Folio Lear was set by B, Cauthen presented the following table as evidence that B's preferential spelling was bin . A Spellings B Spellings Lear Spellings beene (13) beene (4) beene (8) bene (3) bene (6) bene (1) bin (3) bin (24) bin (19) When viewed in relation to copy, however, B's treatment of been cannot be defined in terms of a single preferential form. These statistics show that B had no single preferential spelling of been . In fact, he actively employed, that is followed from copy and introduced against copy, three forms: bin , bene , and beene . Although B does not have a single positive preference, he consistently rejects the been and byn spellings which stand in copy. In the case of each of his acceptable spellings, B adopts about half the number of any given form found in copy. Although B's tolerance of bin forms found in copy is as high as that toward bene and beene , he introduces bin least frequently in replacing other forms. Between bene and beene , B apparently prefers bene , but the evidence is not strong. All in all, been is of little use in penetrating B's texts to his copy. The word serves, however, to show the possibility of a compositor's having several operative forms in his treatment of a given word, that is, various forms which he will both accept, reject, and introduce in place of others found in copy. 2. blood ( bloody ) Compositor B displays a marked preference for -oo- forms of blood and bloody . Of the 103 (+J4) -ou- forms in copy, B changes sixty-three (+J4) to -oo- . At the same time, he retains sixty-one (+J5) of the sixty-six (+J5) -oo- spellings found in copy. It is interesting to note that in spite of his clear-cut preference for -oo- , Compositor B does allow four -ou- spellings in ten to come through into his texts. In all ten plays, there are only five abberant changes of -oo- to -ou- or about one in thirteen occurrences of the word. 3. brief Cauthen's statistics suggest that B has a two to one preference for briefe over breefe . In the Paviers, only one justified -ee- form occurs in copy and this is followed by B. Of the twenty-one (+J3) -ie- forms in copy, B changes five to -ee- and retains sixteen (+J3) as -ie- . From this evidence, it would appear that any preference which these statistics point toward is for -ee- over -ie- . To complete the picture, it would be necessary to be able to observe B's treatment of several -ee- forms when found in copy. 4. choose Alice Walker has suggested that B displays a preference for choose in contrast to A's chuse . In the limited evidence provided by the Paviers, B changes three of the five chuse forms in copy to choose . Of the three choose forms in copy, B retains two but sets one as chuse . Walker's suggestion that B favored choose is confirmed by the evidence in the Paviers. 5. cousin Taking the -o-/-ou- variation as the operative feature, the evidence provided by the Paviers fails to confirm Willoughby's and Walker's suggestion that B preferred -o- forms over -ou- spellings. Of the nine (+J1) -ou- spellings in copy, B retains eight and changes only one (+J1). Of the eleven (+J3) -o- spellings in copy, B retains ten (+J3) and changes only one. 6. dear The variation of -ea-/-ee- is the operative feature in dear . Of the sixty (+J12) -ea- forms found in copy, B changes twenty-three (+J6) to -ee- . He retains all thirty-seven (+J7) -ee- forms in copy. These statistics point clearly to his preference for deere . 7. devil Compositor B expresses a strong preference for the di- form of devil . Of the eighteen (+J7) de- forms in copy, B changes seventeen (+J6) to di- . Only one (+J1) non-preferential de- spelling slips through from copy into B's text. All twenty-seven (+J9) di- forms in copy are retained by B. 8. forfeit Forfeit provides another example, like been , of a situation where multiple alternative spellings [ forfait ( e ), forfet , and forfeit ( e )] were available to B. In this instance, he displays a double preference for forfet and forfeit ( e ) and completely rejects the third alternative. At the same time, he fails to display any single clear-cut preference for either of the two forms which he does use. 9. grant Walker's suggestion that B preferred the grant form is strongly confirmed by the Pavier spellings. He changes every one of the eight (+J1) copy graunt spellings to grant and retains all twelve (+J2) copy grant forms. 10. grief Walker included greefe in her list of B's preferred spellings. Of the thirty-eight (+J5) griefe spellings in copy, B changes seventeen (+J1) to greefe . Both greefe forms in copy are retained. The greefe preference is confirmed. 11. heart B displays a marked preference for the -ea- form of heart . Of the ninety-two (+J13) hart forms in copy, B changes seventy-three (+J6) to -ea- . He retains 111 (+J21) of the 112 (+J24) -ea- forms found in copy. There is only one (+J3) anomalous change of -ea- to -a- . B's -ea- preference is clearly indicated. 12. heaven Alice Walker observed that B preferred uncapitalized heaven up until Macbeth in the Folio. In the Paviers, B changes eight of the nine capitalized Heaven forms to lower case and reproduces thirty-six (+J2) uncapitalized forms found in copy. 13. honey Alice Walker first observed B's preference for the hony spelling of this word. He changes all three honey spellings in copy to hony and reproduces the four short forms which stand in his copy. There is one anomalous change of hony to honny . 14. hour Cauthen and Walker both indicate that B's preferred spelling was houre . Of the thirteen (+J2) -ow- spellings of hour in copy, B changes eleven (+J2) to -ou- . One hower and one houre-glasse spellings are reproduced by B from his copy. He retains all thirty-four (+J4) -ou- forms found in copy. The Pavier evidence indicates that B's preference for -ou- was quite strong. 15. "lushious" The one occurrence of lushious in both copy and Pavier texts is included in this discussion because Alice Walker put great weight upon the coincidence of the lushious spelling in Q1 and Folio Othello . She used this coincidence as evidence that Folio Othello was derived from a marked copy of Q1 (1622). "It is ridiculous to suppose that anomalies like 'timerous' (I.i.76), 'lushious' (I.iii.346) and 'pudled' (III.iv.144) passed from a fair copy, via a prompt book, to a manuscript prepared by a book-keeper with (at best) only half an eye on the prompt-book, and so into Okes's quarto, thereby representing a common legacy in the quarto and Folio from some common ancestor." 18 If Miss Walker had checked the Concordance, she would have found two recorded uses of luscious , in the Othello passage in question (I.iii.354 — — Globe numbering) and in A Midsummer Night's Dream (II.i.251). Both Midsummer Q1 (1600) and the Pavier Q2 (1619) contain the lushious spelling (C2 v in both Qq). Far from being anomalous, the lushious form is common to the compositors of Q1 Midsummer , Q1 Othello , and Jaggard's B. It is interesting to note that the Midsummer lushious is changed to luscious on N3 v in the Folio. Hinman assigns this page to Compositor C. 19 The point of this example is that any common spelling, however "anomalous" it may appear, must be used with extreme caution in attempting to demonstrate direct derivation of one text from another. 16. madam Alice Walker suggested that madam is a characteristic B spelling whereas madame is characteristic of Compositor A. Disregarding the variation of -d-/-dd- and concentrating on -m/-me , the evidence of the Paviers is somewhat mixed. B's copy is slanted in favor of -m (fifty-two +J7) over -me (twenty-seven +J5). Of the twenty-seven (+J5) -me forms, B changes eleven (+J2) to -m and retains sixteen (+J3). On the other hand, a small proportion, seven (+J1) of fifty-two (+J7), -m copy spellings are changed in the opposite direction to -me . B's general preference is indeed for -m , but there are a number of aberrant changes of -m to -me . 17. mistress Five variant spellings of mistress are found in the copy used for the Paviers: mistres (eight +J1), mistris (twenty-two +J10), mistresse (forty-seven +J11), mistrisse (one +J1), and misteris (thirty-five +J5). Of these five spellings, B prefers mistris and mistresse and rejects the other three. Although Alice Walker assigned mistresse to A and mistris to B as characteristic spellings, B's treatment of the word in the Paviers indicates that he employed both forms. On the surface, simple numerical superiority does favor the -is form, but this is a result of the numerical superiority of -is forms in copy. 18. power Cauthen observed that B's texts contained both power (18) and powre (7). 20 In the Paviers, however, B changes the two powre forms in copy to power and retains all twenty-six of the power spellings which stand in his copy, thus indicating a preference for power . 19. prithee Alice Walker noted B's constant use of the spelling prethee in the early sections of the Folio. In the Paviers, B normalized a total of twenty-six (+J6) occurrences of ten different spellings of prithee all to his preferential prethee . He follows one copy prithee , sets one justified copy prithe as prithee , and follows one copy prethe . B's habit in the Paviers coincides, therefore, with Walker's observation of his treatment of prithee in the early parts of the Folio. 20. proud The Paviers confirm Walker's assignment of proud as B's preferential form. B changes the one copy prowd and one (+J1) proude to proud and retains twelve occurrences of the latter form from copy. 21. scarce The evidence supplied by the Paviers confirms the observation that B had a strong preference for the -se form of scarce . He changes all eighteen (+J2) -ce forms in copy to -se and retains all five -se forms which stand in copy. 22. traitor Willoughby and Walker both stress B's preference for traitor over traytor , and the Paviers confirm this preference. Of the twenty-five (+J4) traytor forms in copy, B changes twenty-five (+J1) to traitor . All thirty-five (+J3) -i- forms in copy are retained by B. The only one (+J1) traytor form in B's texts is derived from copy. 23. vile Cauthen assigned the vile spelling to Compositor A and vilde to B. B changes all five vild spellings in copy to vilde and one copy vilde to vile . He reproduces the two (+J1) other vilde spellings found in copy. 24. wee'l ( etc. ) Alice Walker suggested that B had a distinctive preference for wee'l (etc.) spellings as opposed to wee'le (etc.). The following discussion breaks these forms down by person. The various compositors who set the texts used for Pavier copy and Compositor B display a surprising unanimity on the spelling of I'll . There are 124 (+J13) instances of ile in both copy and Pavier texts. One aberrant yle form found in copy is changed to ile . B's one deviation from the standard form occurs in a justified line in which he sets I'le for Ile . He'll , she'll , we'll , and you'll occur in sufficient numbers to demonstrate B's strong preferences for final 'l forms of these words. Several variant factors are involved in these words. The use of the apostrophe, the ending ( -l or -le ) and the doubling (in the case of he'll , she'll and we'll ) of the first e are all separate alternatives operative for these words. B's uniform preferences are for the doubling of the initial e , the use of the apostrophe, and the omission of the final -e . Of the eighteen (+J2) times B encounters heele in copy, he changes eighteen (+J1) of these forms to his preferential hee'l . In the one justified instance, B changes heele to heel . In the two instances in which he encountered hee'le both are changed to hee'l . The one contraction introduced by B changes he will to hee'l . One aberrant hele in B's copy comes through as an unusual heele in his text. Of the five sheele forms in copy, B changes four to shee'l and sets one as shee'll . He changes all four copy shee'le spellings to his preferential shee'l . The one copy shee'l is reproduced by B. Of the two sheel forms in copy, B changes one to shee'l and carries the other over to his text. We'll is a more complex word. B displays a preference for wee'l but is subject to the influence of copy and more prone to deviate from his strict preference. B changes twenty-nine (+J3) weele forms to wee'l . At the same time, he changes two justified weele forms to wee'll , fourteen (+J2) weele forms to weel , three weele forms to weell , one justified weele form to weel and retains eight (+J3) weele forms found in copy. If the three wele spellings in copy, B changes one to his apparent preference wee'l but the other two to weele . The one we'le form is changed to his preferred wee'l as are the eight (+J1) occurrences of wee'le . The two wee'l forms are reproduced from copy. Of the two (+J1) weel spellings in copy, one (+J1) is changed to B's preferential wee'l and one is retained. Both the one weell and the one we wil which are contracted by B become weel . Compositor B displays a strong preference for you'l by changing twenty (+J3) youle spellings to this form. Only twice does he reproduce youle from copy and in one unusual instance sets youle in place of his preferred you'l . One other you'l in copy is retained, and the two you'le forms are shortened to you'l . With the exception of the Ile which is uniformly spelled thusly, Compositor B displays a consistent spelling preference in favor of hee'l , wee'l , and you'l . The only variation comes in his tendency to depart occasionally from his strict habit with respect to wee'l . One additional word can be considered with this group. B's treatment of contracted he is is as follows. Twice he sets hee's for copy he is . Of the eleven (+J4) hees in copy, B sets six (+J4) as hee's and five as he's . The one he's in copy is changed to hee's . Of the seventeen (+J3) hee's spellings in copy, B follows copy seventeen (+J2) times and changes one hee's to hee is in a justified line where these words stand at the very end of the line. B's preference is clearly for the hee's spelling. 25. widow The Pavier evidence confirms Alice Walker's suggestion that B's preference is for widdow . Of the seven (+J1) -d- forms in copy, B changes three to -dd- . He retains eight (+J2) of the ten (+J2) -dd- forms found in copy. In addition, B drops the final -e found on one form in copy. 26. year B's preference is clearly for the yeare spelling. He changes all seven (+J3) -ee- spellings in copy to -ea- and preserves twenty (+J4) of the twenty-one (+J4) -ea- forms found in copy. 27. young Alice Walker assigns the yong spellings to B and young to A. The evidence in the Paviers shows that B's treatment of young does not display a marked preference for either form. Of the thirty-six (+J18) -ou- spellings in copy, B changes eight (+J6) to -o- . On the other hand, he changes eleven (+J6) of the twenty-eight (+J8) -o- spellings to -ou- . The number of changes of -o- to -ou- has a slight numerical superiority over -ou- to -o- , but no clear-cut habit can be observed. It is worth noting the extent to which previous investigators dealing with Compositor B in the Folio and working without the ability to distinguish E from B as well as without reference to copy have determined B's preferential spellings as they are revealed in the Paviers. Four of the five test words proposed by Willoughby as means of identifying B are in fact strong B preferences. 21 Twenty-one of the forms proposed by Alice Walker as characteristic B spellings have been studied in the Paviers, and seventeen of the twenty-one are strong preferential spellings there. Two conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the limited amount of text set by E and the closeness of his overall spelling pattern to that of B have not obscured B's spellings from previous investigators. Second, the fact that seventeen of B's Folio habits are confirmed in the Paviers indicates the extent to which set habits remained fixed. Although it will be necessary for later investigations to analyze B's Folio spellings fully, the preliminary indications are that the Paviers give an excellent idea of B's spellings. This is not to say, however, that any one individual B spelling as observed in the Paviers can be assumed to be his fixed preferential spelling. The general texture of B's spellings in the Paviers, however, should be reflected in his work in the Folio. It is also important to note that the various words here discussed display all of the various logical possibilities for a compositor's treatment of variant spellings. B is seen to display strong preferences for one, two, and even three variant spellings of given words and can display indifference which appears neither to be influenced by a weak preference nor to depend on copy forms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. My examination of the Pavier spellings was undertaken as a result of the hypothesis that an analysis of compositorial spellings can provide not merely the basis for accurately identifying a compositor's work by his preferential spellings, but also the means of seeing through the workman to his copy. In many situations, it would be extremely advantageous, once the compositor has been identified, to penetrate the layer of his spellings and go behind the man to the copy from which he was setting his type. Compositorial identification has concentrated on the discovery of forms like do , go , and heere which are signs indicating that the text in question is B's work. The hypothesis in question stated, however, that if a new group of spellings can be discovered which contains not only these compositorial habits and preferences, but also spellings which reproduce copy spellings as well, there will be a means of seeing through that compositor to his copy. The examination of the Pavier spellings has produced the evidence to verify this hypothesis and has further shown that even the identifying badges, strong preferences, can be used to get at copy spellings. There are various types of words which can produce information about copy. The ideal word is one that has two or more variant spellings which occur in mixed groups and are mechanically reproduced by the compositor in question. Such words which then directly depict the copy spelling at every occurrence turn out to be extremely rare. The only examples which are invariably reliable in the Paviers are art (20) /arte (2), brier (2) /bryer (2), marvell (4) /marveile (5+J1), and pallace (4) /pallas (1). All four of these words occur in the Paviers with limited frequency, but they serve to demonstrate that words can be found which will vary in direct relation to copy. Oh is the best example of a high frequency word which varies in extremely close relation to copy spelling. Of the 361 mixed O (244+J45) and Oh (177+J20) forms in B's copy, 341 reflect copy spellings. When one encounters an O or Oh spelling in B's Pavier texts, therefore, the odds are better than fifteen to one that B's spelling is the spelling which stood in copy. Words of this type which can be said to express compositorial indifference are unfortunately relatively scarce and are, therefore, only one contributing factor to the search for spellings which reflect copy. When they do occur, however, the evidential value is extremely strong. At the other end of the scale are strong habits and preferences which, if viewed from a new perspective and not as identifying badges indicating a given compositor's presence, can contribute clues to copy spellings. Take, for example, do , the strongest of B's preferential spellings. In all of the Paviers, B violates his strong preference fifteen times by setting unjustified doe spellings. Twelve of these fifteen spellings reflect copy spellings. When a doe form is encountered in B's work in contradiction to his known preference, therefore, the odds are four to one that the doe reflects a doe in copy. The same situation holds for goe and here . The odds are fifteen to one in the former case and about thirteen to one in the latter that these contradictions of B's preferred spellings had their origin in copy spellings. Between the words expressing compositorial indifference and those which display a strong preference are all shades of a spectrum. Among these words are many which can be termed weak preference words . These words are those for which B displays some favorite spelling or spellings but neither a very strong habit nor indifference. Dear is an ideal example of a weak preference word. B clearly displays a preference for the deere spelling by following every one of the thirty-seven (+J7) deere spellings in copy and changing twenty-three (+J6) of the sixty (+J12) deare spellings in copy to deere . It is the thirty-seven (+J6) non-preferential deare spellings which B reproduces in his texts from his copy, however, which are of importance for copy study. B's preference was weak, and he allowed it to be subordinated to copy spellings in these numerous instances so that all of these deare spellings in his texts directly reflect copy spellings. We are, so to speak, able to see through B back to copy when we see a deare in his text. Dear is spoken of as an ideal example of a weak preference, copy-reflecting word because the complete absence of aberrant -ee- to -ea- changes makes the deare absolutely reliable as an indication of the copy spelling. Every single one of the thirty-seven (+J6) -ea- forms in B's texts directly reflects an -ea- form in copy. There are, of course, many gradations of preferences ranging from words that approach the strong habits like do , go , and heere to those which fade into examples of compositorial indifference. In addition, many of these weak preference words are not like deare in being 100% reliable. Perfect reliability is not, however, a requisite for words to use in copy study. Take, for example, the weak preference word credit . B's demonstrable preference is for the credite spelling, but he sets credit seven (+J1) times. Of these seven times, six reflect six of the thirteen credit spellings in copy and one represents an aberrant change of the supposedly preferred credite to credit . This one aberrancy does not destroy the value of the word for the purpose of getting at copy since the odds are still six to one that credit in the Pavier text will reflect credit in copy. The following compilation includes over 100 words which, within the Pavier texts, demonstrably reflect the characteristics of copy. Here, therefore, is the verification of the hypothesis that a class of copy-reflecting words does exist. In the table, the second column lists B's observable preference or preferences, if any, for a given spelling of the word in question. The third column lists the forms which are members of the newly discovered class of copy-reflecting spellings. The numbers in parentheses after both forms give the number of times that these forms occur in B's work in the Paviers. A comparison of these figures will indicate roughly the place of that word in the spectum ranging from strong preference to indifference. The final column is a rough attempt to indicate the reliability of the form in column three as a reflection of copy. This percentage indicates the fraction of the instances recorded in column three which reflect copy. It must be noted that many of the copy-reflecting forms occur only infrequently, but the fact that a given copy-reflecting form occurs only once or twice does not by itself lessen the value of that form as an indication of copy. The total picture for each word must be examined. For example, alreadie occurs only once as a copy-reflecting form but this one occurrence is highly reliable when it is seen that B's preference for already is relatively strong and, therefore, any deviation from it is likely to be done under the influence of copy. B changed nine of the ten -ie forms in copy to -y and retained all three -y forms in copy. The one alreadie , therefore, that slipped through is, like the few doe , goe , and here forms which slipped through in contradiction of strong preferences, highly reliable as an indication of the copy spelling. Words have been included in this list down to a 67% degree of reliability. This 67% figure in itself may not sound as strong as when it is expressed in the form of two-to-one odds that the copy-reflecting spelling does indicate the spelling in copy. This percentage is calculated only for the unjustified occurrences of the spellings in the third column so as to remove any possible contamination from the exigencies of justification. Since it is impossible to draw lines dividing the spectrum of copy-reflecting words into different groups, the percentage of reliability must be considered in conjunction with the number of times the preferential (column two) and copy-reflecting (column three) spellings occur in B's texts in order to evaluate the significance of a specific spelling as a form which reflects copy. Because of the dangers inherent in dealing with statistically small samples, even this rough indication of relative percentages of reliability has been omitted for words which do not occur at least ten times in the Paviers.

The large number of spellings which belong to this class and the consistently high degree of their reliability at reflecting copy spellings show that words which reflect copy are an important part of the overall pattern of B's spellings. Compositor B has more than simple preferential spellings; he has a complex pattern of strong preferences, weak preferences, tolerances, and even mechanical indifference. Time after time under the pressure of copy, he sets non-preferential spellings about which he was relatively indifferent and thereby allows his texts to transmit the evidence of spellings which lie behind them. No longer must the person investigating a B text look only for do and go and heere spellings. He will look for doe , goe , here , youle , wind and so on, which by long odds are indications of copy spellings. Using a large number of the forms which reflect copy spellings, we can now start to assemble from the evidence in B's texts a projection of the texture of copy spellings. Until the Pavier statistics are carefully extended by word counts on control situations in the Folio, no thoroughgoing application of this new method for determining spelling features of unknown or disputed copy can be attempted. As a brief test of the validity of this theoretical technique, however, let us turn to the first text occurring in the 1623 Folio which was set by B from known copy and perform a formal experiment in hopes of indicating the validity of the technique. Such an experiment can offer a formal demonstration under laboratory-like conditions of this new method for determining the characteristics of copy. From the Folio text, we can use the group of spellings reflecting copy to predict the spellings of words in the copy used for the Folio. Turning then to this copy, the validity or invalidity of the procedure will be apparent. According to Hinman's study, Compositor B set the last six pages of Love's Labors Lost in the Folio (M4 r -M6 v ). 22 Examining these six Folio pages, we find the following forms which occur in unjustified lines and should, on the basis of the results of the Pavier analysis, indicate copy spellings. alwaies 1 bin 1 deare 3 griefe 1 hart 3 jest 5 O 12 show 3 sodaine 1 yong 1 These six Folio pages include, therefore, thirty-one spellings which, at odds ranging from two to one ( yong ) to virtual certainty ( deare ) should be reflections of spellings which stood in B's copy. The experimental demonstration now depends on the confirmation or denial of the existence of these predicted phenomena by checking the control text, Love's Labors Lost Q1 (1598). 23 Checking these predicted spellings against the actual copy, we find that twenty-nine of the thirty-one or 93% of the projected spellings are in fact the spellings which stood in copy. Here is strong evidence that the hitherto unrecognized group of copy-reflecting spellings within B's total spelling system functions as an indication of copy. The strength of this experiment cannot be overemphasized. Starting with an hypothesis theoretically proposing the existence of a class of spellings which could be used as indications of copy spellings, a class of copy-reflecting spellings was constituted from the evidence derived from the control situation in the Paviers. The Folio sample was then examined for the presence of these newly discovered forms, and once they were found, yet another control confirmed the validity of the spellings themselves as reflections of copy and the validity of the technique of projecting copy spellings from the evidence in B's texts. Here is a classic case in bibliography of hypothesis, prediction, and experimental verification. It has now been demonstrated that a portion of a compositor's total spelling pattern is composed of spellings which directly reflect the spellings found in the compositor's copy. Although many investigators have conjectures about the origins and characteristics of copy used for various printed texts, the discovery and use of what are here called copy-reflecting spellings is the first procedure for determining features of copy. Many formerly vexing problems should be resolved by a thorough implementation of this method. After further investigation of spellings which reflect copy in Folio texts set by B from known copy, the road will be open to solve disputed problems like the possibility of the use of an annotated hybrid of Q1 (1608) and Q2 (1619) as copy for Folio Lear . Although authorities agree that the Folio Lear text was set from an annotated quarto, there is no agreement on the exact nature of copy. Using B's copy-reflecting spellings, one may be able to reliably project various features of the copy from B's share of the Folio text and then by inspection see which of the quartos matches the projection. In the case of texts set from MSS, these spellings which depend on copy spellings may provide the first substantial evidence concerning the specific physical features of copy. This new method, therefore, makes a start at enabling textual investigators to tackle one of the most vexing problems in establishing texts of English Renaissance drama, the nature of the lost MS copy behind extant printed texts. More specifically, when the technique has been applied to all of the workmen in the Shakespeare Folio, we may then possess an excellent tool for getting closer to the copy behind the texts of important Shakespearean plays that were printed for the first time in the Folio. The day may come when we can apply these techniques to texts set from Shakespearean foul papers and arrive at a far more intimate knowledge of the orthographical features of Shakespearean holograph than is at all possible today.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Revisions of Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison by Robert Craig Pierson 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four editions of Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison contain revisions: the second (1754), the third (1754), the fourth (Volume VII, 1756; Volumes I-VII, 1762), and a London edition of 1810. William Merritt Sale, Jr., describes the first three of these editions and states that the second, third, and Volume VII of the fourth were revised, 2 but no one has attempted to ascertain the extent and nature of the revisions. The edition of 1810 has hitherto not been commented on. At present the edition published by the Shakespeare Head Press (Oxford, 1931), which simply reprints the second (octavo) edition, is considered "standard." No edition is now in print. I have collated the texts of the four editions mentioned above and of the first edition in an effort to discover what sorts of revision Richardson made in the novel and which edition best represents his final intention. The first edition (seven volumes duodecimo) and the second (six volumes octavo) were published simultaneously. Volumes I-IV of both editions were published November 13, 1753, and on December 11, 1753, Volumes V-VI (duodecimo) and Volume V (octavo) went on sale. The last volumes of these editions were published March 14, 1754. The collation of the first and second editions shows that there is an appreciable difference between them. The evidence is clear that Richardson made his changes for the second edition from an examination of the first, for the changes are frequently corrections. No single instance could be considered a large revision, but there are 928 changes in the second edition. Of the 928 changes, 369 are words that have been italicized in the second. Richardson apparently intended for the italicized words to be emphasized as if the reader were speaking dialogue aloud as in a play: "But talk to her: I hardly dare" (III, 70; II, 326); 3 "But, nephew, I am not a young man" (III, 83; II, 339). In 60 instances the two texts differ in the use of parentheses or brackets. In general, the second edition occasionally has parentheses where the first has commas, or brackets where the first has parentheses. Richardson's purpose seems to have been to set apart more emphatically such things as interpolations, "stage directions," or digressions: "There, there (sitting down by me) no bustle" (I, 264); "I stamped in tender passion [I am sure it was in tender passion]" (I, 122). Another frequent change (70 instances) is from "an" to "a" before words beginning with "h" and occasionally before vowels with a consonantal pronunciation. Throughout the second edition there are changes which are clearly grammatical corrections. Four times the number of the verb has been changed so as to agree with the subject: "EVERY one of the Dunstable party say" to "EVERY one of the Dunstable party says" (IV, 225; 53). Twice the revision results in the agreement between the pronoun and the antecedent. A change in the principal part of the verb "run" occurs four times, and the revision of a clause so as to eliminate a preposition at the end four times: "that which you have been joint partakers in" to " that in which you have been joint partakers" (III, 73; II, 329. A change in verb tense takes place five times. Many of the changes in the second edition are of single words, and sometimes the new word does not bring about any discernible improvement. Of the 93 single-word changes in the second edition, twelve are of prepositions: "did you make any-body uneasy at your passion" to "with your passion" (I, 88); "I intended to talk to you" to "talk with you" (III, 363; 203). Frequently a word or phrase was changed to one less informal or to one that is more polite or more appropriate: "to tell fibs" to "to be guilty of an untruth" (I, 44); "Has been put to shifts" to "Has been put to difficulties" (II, 217; 116); "could hardly away with his particularities" to "could hardly excuse his particularities" (VI, 311; V, 333); "Sorry fellow" to "Sorry wretch" (IV, 268; 96); "gentleman" to "man" (I, 107); "Lady" to "woman" (VI, 41; V, 63). Upon reading the sheets of the first edition, Richardson must sometimes have seen a necessity for adding phrases or clauses in order to clarify or explain a passage. There are 30 instances of this practice: "had raised such a conflict as her tender nature could not bear" to "had raised such a conflict in her mind, as her tender nature could not bear" (III, 187; 27); "how am I to be distressed on all sides! by good men too; as Sir Charles could say by good women" to "how am I to be distressed on all sides! by good men too; as Sir Charles could say he was, by good women" (IV, 210; 38). The rewording or shifting of phrases, clauses, and sentences for greater clarity, for emphasis, or for a logical comparison occurs 46 times: "These were the different answers given me by his porter, with as much confusion, as I ask'd with impatience" to "These were the different answers given me by his porter, with as much confusion, as I had impatience" (I, 175); "But you know what will justify me for the steps I have taken in every eye" to "But you know what will justify me in every eye for the steps I have taken" (I, 213); "Were it not that we must be afraid to appear over-forward to the man himself , the world is a contemptible thing, and we should treat it as such" to "were it not that we must be afraid to appear over-forward to the man himself , we should treat the opinion of the world with contempt" (VI, 92-93; V, 114-115). Richardson was always concerned that his characters speak and act in a manner consistent with their station, and he was particularly receptive to those suggestions of people who were of a higher social class than he. Fourteen times he made an alteration in the form of a title or of direct address to avoid affectation, impropriety, or excessive elegance: "my dear" to "Lucy" (I, 15); "my cousin Reeves" to "Mr. Reeves" (I, 202); "her Ladyship" to "her" (II, 137; 36); "your Lordship" to "you" (IV, 11; III, 225). One other matter of propriety received Richardson's attention. Perhaps through an oversight in the first edition, Harriet's cousins, Lucy and Nancy, who, like Harriet, are guests in the home of their uncle, are not included in an invitation to dine with Lord and Lady W. In two places in the second edition, Richardson made minor revisions to assure that they were included (IV, 129; III, 343). There are seven changes of dates, of which two are corrections of errors in the first (II, 299, 198; VII, 107, VI, 107). Richardson's reasons for changing the other dates are not so apparent. In a conversation between Harriet and Sir Charles's sisters, three "day before yesterday's" are changed to "yesterday's" (II, 289-290; 188-189). There is nothing in the letters preceding or following this one of Harriet's that indicates a contradiction in the time of events. Nor have I found a reason for the change in the date of a letter from Charlotte to Harriet: " Tuesday , Aug. 8" to " Monday, Aug. 7" (V, 203; IV, 332). Richardson added three footnotes to the text of the second edition. In each case he refers the reader to another letter or passage: "( a ) This passage, is that where he hints at Lady Clementina's noble rejection of him, p. 386. l. 17. beginning 'I leave Italy,' to the end of the paragraph" (IV, 387). Perhaps Richardson thought the reader's memory needed jogging, but he may have used footnotes as a device for his pose as editor. Other differences between the first and second editions include a shift in the order of the subject and the verb (5); a shift in the position of an adverb (8); the addition of "he said," "replied she," and the like (6); the deletion of such expressions (4); the deletion of words such as "that" introducing noun clauses or the "to" of the infinitive (25); and an increase in the number of paragraphs (18). Many of these revisions may have been Richardson's, but they do not follow any consistent pattern and do not seem to be of particular importance. The third edition of Grandison was published in seven volumes March 19, 1754, five days after the publication of the final volumes of the first and second editions. Volume VII presents difficulties because the sheets of the first and third editions were sent to the bindery at the same time with the result that some of the copies of both editions are a mixture of first and third edition gatherings (Sale, pp. 73-76). Sale describes one copy of the third edition of Volume VII that has all third edition signatures and a third edition title page. I have been unable to examine this copy since the Yale University Library reports it missing. However, I have compared two copies of Volume VII that are in agreement in all but the K signature. One copy agrees with the K signature of the first edition; the other has a few minor revisions. Accepting the analysis of the first and third edition signatures according to Sale, I have a collation of the third edition of Volume VII for all signatures except E and G-I. Some of the alerations which I will show as being made for the fourth edition were probably made for the third. Most of the 932 revisions in the third edition are like those of the second. Some appear to have resulted from suggestions Richardson received from his acquaintances and admirers. When he sent the volumes of Grandison to people like Lady Bradshaigh or Miss Catherine Talbot, he usually asked that they send him their suggested corrections. His correspondence contains evidence that his requests were often granted. Among the suggestions that he received, those of the clergyman Patrick Delany and Miss Talbot appear to have been followed. On December 20, 1753, Delany wrote that he "was offended by three words, leer, ogle , and stare , to which I am sure I shall never be reconciled, at least from the mouth of a fair lady, as they are there used." 4 In three instances two of the words that he found offensive have been changed (I, 62; I, 68, 69; VI, 47). He had also a more important objection — "the only one I can remember. You put the defence of learning in the mouth of a fool, and it succeeds accordingly. I am far from blaming your ridicule of pedantry. Harriet very properly exposes it, with a great deal of wit and good sense. But she, who had been so well instructed by her grandfather, a man of learning, should, methinks, have found something in defence of it, wherewith to have finished the dispute." On December 22 Richardson went to some lengths to clear himself and added: "And could I presume to hope for the Direction of the Dean of Down in this Particular, I would weave in his Sentiments on the Subject, and think them the greatest Ornament of the Volume. May I, Sir, be permitted to hope your condescending assistance for another Edition, which is soon to be taken in Hand?" (Forster MS [Victoria and Albert Museum] XV, 4, foll. 17-18). It is likely that even if Delany sent his views on the subject of learning and the ancients they could not have been included in the third edition if a remark of Richardson's to Lady Bradshaigh means that all the volumes were being printed by January 4, 1754: "I am proceeding at different Presses with my Second Edition [third duodecimo]" (Forster MS XI, fol. 60). However, Richardson did make some minor changes. In the seventeen pages of Volume I devoted chiefly to the debate between Harriet and Mr. Walden, Richardson modified several passages. He deleted a passage that was unkind to the ancients: But supposing the knowledge of these antients, continued I, as great as you please, is it not to be lamented, is it not, indeed, strange, that none of the modern learned, notwithstanding the advantage of their works (most of which they have taught to speak our language); notwithstanding the later important discoveries in many branches of science; notwithstanding a Revelation from Heaven, to which the religion of the Pagans was foolishness (and on which foolishness, however, I am told, most of the works of antiquity are founded); should have deserved a higher consideration in the comparison, than as pygmies to giants? (I, 69-70) A passage of about the same length and on the same subject is deleted from the third edition at the beginning of Letter xiii (I, 70) and a paragraph of empty chatter fills the space. A relatively short example of an addition that may have resulted from Delany's objections is a sentence explaining that Mr. Walden is not to be taken as representative of university education: "I have since been told, that this pragmatical man has very few admirers in the University to which, out of it, he is so fond of boasting a relation" (I, 65). Miss Talbot wrote to Richardson an objection to Sir Charles's excess of virtue and to his passive behavior and filial obedience at a time when his father's actions were going far toward impoverishing Sir Charles and his sisters: "He rather exalts his Fathers Character too much since tho his Father he was really a bad man. From the same Principles of Filial Duty had Lovelace had a Son that Son should have praised him. This therefore is at least the Excess of a Virtue. His offer to his Father Vol 2 d 8 vo P 56 too unlimited" (n.d., Forster MS XV, 4, fol. 49). In an undated note in reply, Richardson wrote that Sir Charles "consents to what he could not prevent, were his Father determined; and shall he not do it in such a Manner, as to have Weight upon Sir Thomas, and increase his Consequence with him for the future Good of himself and Sisters?" (Forster MS XV, 4, fol. 50), but he concluded the note with the remark that he would add a little to what Harriet says "that he may be better understood." In the first edition Harriet comments upon Sir Charles's filial duty in these words: "Policy, therefore, would have justified the young gentleman's chearful compliance, had he not been guided by superior motives." The third edition adds: "Sir Charles would not, I think one may be sure, have sacrificed to the unreasonable desires even of a Father, the fortune to which he had an unquestionable right: An excess of generosity, amiable indeed, but pitiable, as contrary to the justice that every man owes to himself, and to those who hereafter may depend upon him . . ." (II, 158). As in the second edition, the number of words in italics is increased. There are 102 words italicized for the first time. But whereas the second edition has an italicized word of the first edition in regular type in only two instances, the third edition has 42 such changes. A possible explanation for this seeming contradiction in Richardson's practice is that the changes may have been made by compositors. Because of the press of work in his own shop, Richardson employed the services of several other printing shops in order to speed up the publication of his third edition. 5 Parentheses or brackets are added 28 times in the third edition: "and our joy (looking round him) will then be complete" (VI, 71); "This last plaudit gratified my pride [I need not tell my Dr. Bartlett, that I have pride]" (III, 83). Before words beginning with "h," the article "an" has been changed to "a" 60 times. The grammatical corrections, like those in the second edition, indicate Richardson's concern for accuracy and for formal expression. In the third edition, the number of the verb has been changed to produce subject and verb agreement in ten instances: "neither of the two daughters were able" to "neither of the two Daughters was able" (II, 153); "There, Sir, is pen, ink, and paper" to "There, Sir, are pen, ink, and paper" (VI, 156). A change in the principal part of the verb occurs four times. Richardson revised three clauses in the third edition to eliminate the preposition at the end, and a shift of verb tense occurs 14 times. Changes in single words in the third edition appear to have been made for a variety of reasons; there are 126 single word variations, many of which resemble those of the second edition — the new word is often less colloquial or more appropriate: "I warrant" to "I suppose" (I, 56); "put up at a nephew's of his" to "stop at a Nephew's of his" (VI, 138). Again phrases or sentences have been added to explain or clarify; however, the list of reasons might be only a little shorter than the list of the 46 additions. Three examples will indicate the kinds of revisions: "The Marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes, and looked upon me with tenderness" to "The Marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes; but withdrawing it again, looked upon me with tenderness" (III, 333); "Once I remember, he wished that his Majesty would take a summer's progress thro' his British, another into his Irish, dominions" to which Richardson added "because the more he was personally known, the more he would be beloved" (VII, 16); after "I should choose which of the men-servants I would more particularly call my own," Richardson added "I have not, my dearest Life, said he, run into the taste of our modern gentry, for foreign servants, any more than for foreign equipages. I am well served; yet all mine are of our own country" (VII, 26). Richardson deleted words and phrases from his second edition, but not to the extent that he did from the third, which has 67 deletions. The more important ones indicate a good pruning job: "Notice being given of dinner, Lord L. took my hand, and Sir Charles complaisantly led his sister Charlotte to her seat at the table; Lady L. being gone into the dining parlour before" to "Notice being given of dinner, Sir Charles complaisantly led his Sister Charlotte to her seat at the table" (III, 129); from "by the permission he has given to Dr. Bartlett, to oblige me, and through me, his sisters, and all you my own friends" the last eleven words were cut (III, 264). The rewording or shifting of phrases, clauses, and sentences for clarity, parallel structure, or logical comparison occurs 78 times in the third edition: "Have I pride, Miss Grandison? coldly and gravely, as my cousin observed to me afterwards, asked I" to "Have I pride, Miss Grandison? coldly and gravely asked I, as my Cousin observed to me afterwards" (II, 74); "the whole Urbino branch of the family, were not to be moved; and the less, as they considered the alliance as highly honourable to me . . . as derogatory to their own honour" to "the whole Urbino branch of the family, were not to be moved; and the less, because they considered the alliance as derogatory to their own honour in the same proportion as they thought it honourable to me" (III, 191). The most extensive revision in the third edition comes under the general heading of propriety. There are 136 such changes: more appropriate or less affected titles or forms of address; impersonal references to servants; deletion of affected repetition; deletion or modification of indelicate or affected words, phrases, and clauses; and a reduction of immoderate praise. There is nothing in Richardson's extant correspondence that points specifically to any of the revisions, but he often requested that his women correspondents send him descriptions of the life and of the people he wrote about but did not know first hand, and many of them did so. Before the publication of Grandison , for example, he wrote Mrs. Anne Donnellan on July 20, 1750, asking for a description of a fine man: "As to the fine man , what shall be done, if such ladies as Miss Sutton, who can so well tell what she does not like, will not do us the honor to let us know what she does ? Will she, or will you, Madam, be so good as to acquaint me what he is to do, and what he is not to do, in order to acquire and maintain an exemplary character?" (Barbauld, IV, 12) Later, on February 22, 1752, he again wrote Mrs. Donnellan: "I want much your assistance and Mrs. Delany's, in describing a scene or two in upper life" (Barbauld, IV, 61). One of Richardson's letters contains a hint that he may have followed some suggestions of Mrs. Donnellan and Mrs. Delany. In a letter of December 22, 1753, to Dr. Delany, he wrote, "Mrs. Donnellan has told me of some Objections in which Mrs. Delany joined with her, relating to Points of Delicacy in the Female Characters. When the Whole shall be before her, I shall think myself highly honoured by her Remarks" (Forster MS XV, 4, fol. 18). Many of the revisions involve Harriet Byron. Besides being the principal feminine character, she is by far the principal correspondent of the novel. As the object of every one's love, praise, admiration, and respect, she is too often in the position of having to report the conversations of those who pour out effusive tributes to her beauty, her skill as a disputant in the defense of modern learning, her magnanimity toward her rival for Sir Charles's love, and even her incomparable grace as a dancer. These tributes do not disappear from the third edition, but many have been deleted or revised. The last eleven words were cut from "Lady Betty whisperingly congratulated me on having made so considerable a conquest, as she was sure I had, by Sir Hargrave's looks, in which was mingled reverence with admiration, as she expressed herself" (I, 80), and the parenthesis was cut from "But when the coach (attended by many neighbours and friends, who, like a gathering snowball, had got together, within a few miles of Selbyhouse) set us down at the inner-gate, there, in the outward-hall, sat my blessed grandmamma" (IV, 222). "Woman is the glory of all created existence: — But you, madam, are more than woman" is deleted (III, 133). Other revisions in the third edition concerning Harriet attempt to remove the few frailties she has. Gone with a stroke, for example, is the suggestion that Harriet could hate: "Do you think he could not be put upon saying something affronting to me; upon doing something unworthy of his character? — O then I am sure I should hate him: All the other instances of his goodness would then be as nothing. I will be captious, I think, and study to be affronted, whether he intends to affront me, or not" to "Do you think he can always go on thus triumphantly? So young a man — So admired, so applauded — Will he never be led into doing something unworthy of his character? — If he could, do you think I should then be partial to him? O no! I am sure I should not! — I should disdain him — I might grieve, I might pity —" (III, 19). In 27 instances affected behavior has been decreased. Less and less do the characters throw themselves at someone's feet, bend their knees, wet someone's hand with their tears, or hide their faces in a generous bosom: "I flung my fond arms about his neck, and, hiding my glowing face in his bosom, called him, murmuringly, the most just, the most generous, of men" to "I flung my fond arms about his neck, and called him the most just, the most generous, of men" (VII, 39); "I have now no desire in my heart so strong, as to throw myself at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt; and to be embraced by my Lucy and Nancy, and all my Northamptonshire Loves" to "I have now no desire in my heart so strong, as to return to all my dear Northamptonshire friends" (IV, 174). In 32 instances in the third edition affected redundant expressions have been revised: "Why, why, would you deny me" to "Why would you deny me" (VI, 8); "All, all my hopes" to "All my hopes" (VI, 43); "happy, happy memory" to "happy memory" (VII, 48). Of the sixteen changes in forms of titles and address in the third edition, most are changes to something either more formal or more fitting to the occasion: "my papa Deane's" to "my Godfather Deane's" (I, 250); "Such a mamma as you were blessed with" to "Such a Mother as you were blessed with" (II, 174); "the dear creature" to "she" (VI, 315); "O my Lady G." to "madam" (VII, 5); "a gentleman to a lady" to "a man to a woman" (II, 45). There are other revisions in the third edition which must have resulted from attention to matters of propriety. One instance is in a letter from Lady G. to Harriet which in the first and second editions reads "Mrs. Reeves desires me to acquaint you, that Miss Clements having, by the death of her mother and aunt, come into a pretty fortune, is addressed to by a Yorkshire gentleman of easy circumstances, and is preparing to go down thither to reside." The revision in the third edition clears up any possible misunderstanding: "is preparing to leave the town, having other connexions in that county" (IV, 270). Harriet in a conversation with Sir Charles learns that the Porretta family, desperate over the deteriorating mental condition of Lady Clementina, has asked that Sir Charles return to Italy to help in any way he can, and has also just read a letter of Mrs. Beaumont's which describes the cruel treatment of Clementina at the hands of her cousin Laurana. Upset over what she has just learned, Harriet needs a few moments to compose herself. Opportunely, her cousin Reeves enters the room. In the earlier editions she takes advantage of her cousin's appearance to leave the room and to go up to her apartment. After a short time, during which she reasons with herself, she returns just as her cousin withdraws: "Sir Charles met me at the door: I hope he saw dignity in my aspect, without pride." In the third edition when her cousin enters, she walks to the far end of the room while "a short complimental discourse passed between them" and talks with herself. As her cousin leaves the room, Sir Charles approaches her: "I attempted to assume a dignity of aspect, without pride" (IV, 60-61). What appears to have mattered in this scene is Harriet's conduct. The apparent reason for the change is that Harriet's leaving the room just as her cousin enters appears rude. Also, her sudden departure could easily have given Mrs. Reeves the impression that she had intruded upon Sir Charles and Harriet at an inopportune moment and that Harriet's emotional state was such that she could not remain in the room while Mrs. Reeves was present. Other revisions similar to those in the second edition are added footnotes (4), changes in dates (7), and an increase in the number of paragraphs (53). As in the second edition, there are footnotes that remind the reader of a previous passage or give him a hint of things to come: "( a ) This argument is resumed, Vol. VI. p. 363. by a more competent judge both of learning and languages than Mr. Walden" (I, 66). Several of the changes in dates are corrections. An example will point out Richardson's attention to such matters: "I received our Jeronymo's Letter but yesterday" to "I received our Jeronymo's Letter but on Monday" (VII, 115). In both editions the letter is dated " Wedn. night , Febr. 14" (VII, 114), and in another letter with the same date, Harriet writes to Lady G. and Lady L. that Sir Charles received Jeronymo's letter while he was at dinner on Monday (VII, 103). Richardson sometimes used paragraphs for the purpose of making an unbroken type page or long passage more appealing to the eye, but there is sufficient evidence in the third edition to show that an increase in the number of paragraphs was often the result of deleted passages. The third edition is to a large extent a page for page reprint of the first, and in order to keep the texts of the two editions together, Richardson (or the compositors) took passages of the first edition text and broke them into more paragraphs in order to fill the space that resulted from deleted material. For instance, in Volume IV, pages 127-128, the first edition has thirteen lines describing the praises of the entire company as Sir Charles and Harriet dance. This passage does not appear in the third edition. Although the wording of the rest of the letter is identical in the two editions, the first has four paragraphs and the third has nine. On page 130 the first and the third editions are line for line again. One kind of revision (16 instances) that occurs in the third edition but not in the second is the deletion or modification of lists of characters: "Mr. Deane, Sir Charles, Lord and Lady W. Mrs. Shirley, Mr. and Mrs. Selby, Lucy, Lord L. and I, withdrew, to read, and see signed, the Marriage articles" to "We most of us withdrew, to hear read the marriage Articles" (VI, 314). Mr. Sale has noted (p. 82) that one passage in the third edition (II, 348-349) follows the wording of a cancellandum rather than a cancellans of the first. 6 It contains harsh remarks about the Italians, in connection with Dr. Bartlett's treatment in Venice, which Richardson softened in the cancellans. Apparently Richardson corrected a copy for the third edition that did not contain the cancellans and did not notice the mistake, and the text of the cancellandum appears in all subsequent editions. There is no mention in Richardson's correspondence of plans to publish another edition of Grandison after the third, but there is a set in the Brown University Library with a revised Volume VII dated 1756. The first six volumes of this set have first and third edition title pages: Volumes II, V, and VI have first edition, and Volumes I, III and IV have third. The sheets which make up the text of the first six volumes are a mixture of first and third editions. Three signatures of Volume IV (B-D) are settings of type unlike the copies which I have seen of either the first or third editions, but there are no variations in the text from the earlier editions. The seventh volume is made up in part of sheets of the first and third editions and eleven signatures with a different setting of type: B, D-H (except for H5 and H8), K, O, and S-U. All of these signatures contain revisions. Since Volumes I-VI of the Brown set have no variations from the first and third editions, they may be dismissed, but Volume VII is a revised text. Sale (pp. 87-91) places the 1756 Volume VII in the section in which he describes the fourth edition (1762), and his classification of the volume as a first issue of the fourth edition Volume VII seems the most appropriate. The fourth edition of Grandison was published in monthly installments beginning February 1, 1762, seven months after Richardson's death. Of the total of 448 changes (exclusive of many obvious printer's errors) in Volumes I-VII, 298 occur in Volumes I-VI, but all of those in the first six volumes are of a minor nature and may have been made by the compositors. Changes in single words account for 84 of them; the addition of a single word accounts for 28; a single word has been deleted in 52 instances. A shift in the position of an adverb occurs 19 times; subject and verb order is changed 6 times. Words italicized in the third edition but not italicized in the fourth make up 21 of the changes. Plural forms of nouns changed to singular, the elimination of contractions, change of verb tense, and a shift from the subjunctive to the indicative mood account for almost all of the rest of the differences between these volumes of the third and fourth editions. A few examples of single word changes will show that nothing is gained. Frequently the change, if it is not actually an error, is less effective than the third edition reading: "by his smiling benignity" to "by this smiling benignity" (I, 258); "That is not fair" to "This is not fair" (II, 21); "the feather in another man's cap" to "the feather of another man's cap" (III, 116). Among the additions of single words are "a man of middling stature" to "a man of a middling stature" (II, 10); "He hoped I did not take amiss, that they invited me not the day before" to "He hoped I did not take it amiss, that they invited me not the day before" (V, 152). Many of the deletions of single words could perhaps be accidental: "which I had but a little while before concluded" to "which I had but a little before concluded" (IV, 67); "she must not, she shall not, be yours" to "she must not, shall not, be yours" (V, 132). Shifting of word order, especially of adverbs, seems to be without design: "it shall be only when you ask it" to "it shall only be when you ask it" (II, 79); "I was once thought not unworthy" to "I once was thought not unworthy" (III, 339, 341). There is no reason to assume that any of these changes in the first six volumes were authorized by Richardson. The revisions in the seventh volume of the Brown set (1756) and in the fourth edition (1762) are a continuation of the types found in the second, but many are similar to the more careful revisions in the interest of propriety found in the third. Sale believes that all the sheets for both the 1756 and 1762 editions were printed about 1756 "but that for some reason Richardson did not reprint the sheets of Vols. I-VI at this time" (p. 89). Probably the reason he did not is that by 1756 only a small edition was called for, and Richardson apparently had a sufficient number of sheets remaining from the first and third editions to make up Volumes I-VI and a number of sheets of Volume VII. He may have reprinted all the sheets for Volume VII in 1756 but used the reprinted sheets in the 1756 edition only for sections for which he did not have a sufficient number of the earlier ones. Sale cites as evidence for a 1756 printing the resemblances between the formats of the volumes of 1756 and 1762 and their differences from Volumes I-VI (1762): "No ornaments are used in Vols. I-VI; the volume number and letter number are omitted from the running head-line" (p. 89). The date of the printing of the sheets in signatures C, I, L-N, P-R, and the two conjugate leaves H5 and H8 used in the 1762 edition cannot be definitely established; but since signatures B, D-H (except H5 and H8), K, O, and S-U are the same in the editions of 1756 and 1762, there is a strong likelihood that the others were printed at the same time. The most interesting feature of both issues of Volume VII is the evidence that Richardson followed some of the suggestions of Lady Bradshaigh. Almost incontrovertible proof of her assistance is found in the marginalia of her copy of Volume VII first edition, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library. Comments and suggestions in her handwriting and remarks in Richardson's run throughout the volume. In a letter dated May 21, 1754, Lady Bradshaigh remarked: You wish to see my corrections as you call them. I own I have taken the liberty (conscious at the same time that I presume too much) of altering , not correcting , as I went a long, here a scratch, there a word chang'd, or so, — and if I do not let you see what I have done, it is not that I want courting to it, but that I am sure you cou'd not read the scroles I have interlin'd, nor understand my meaning, for upon casting back my eye, I found myself , under some difficulty. but when I am so happy to see you, that I can explain the uninteligible jargon, if it was ten times worse, and you desire it, you shall look it over. Richardson acknowledged the receipt of her copy of Grandison on July 9, 1754: "A thousand thanks to your Ladiship for your returned Volumes with remarks in the margin. I have had time but to dip into them. I shall be greatly improved by them &amp; corrected in another edition, should the work come to another." On June 25, 1757, she wrote that his heroines have too many "Reverential Expressions" for their parents and went on to remark that she believes he has found "many an impudent scratch in my Sr C: G:" (a reference to her influence in inducing him to write the novel). He replied on July 12 with thanks for "many Hundreds of the Kindest Corrections." He did not return the set to Lady Bradshaigh until January 2, 1758. In his letter of that date he clearly stated that he had taken her advice in some places: "Perhaps when you have a little vacant time, you will be amused with casting your Eye on your own Remarks, &amp; on what I thankfully allow'd, &amp; humbly disallow'd of them." (Forster MS XI, foll. 99, 110, 206, 211, 229) Of the 150 differences between the seventh volume of the third edition and of the fourth (1762), 64 follow the suggestions of Lady Bradshaigh altogether or in part. Ninety-six of the 150 changes occur in the 1756 issue, and of these 34 follow the suggestions she made. The majority of her recommended revisions may be regarded as matters of propriety. They are quite similar to the revisions that Richardson had made in the third edition. A number of Lady Bradshaigh's suggestions which Richardson followed are minor ones: twelve times she struck out the word "guest" or "guests" and wrote in "company"; fourteen of the changes are in the form of address: "my dear grandmamma" to "Madam" (p. 13*); 7 "my Love" to "my Harriet" (p. 38); "my dearest Love" to "my dear" (p. 75*). Some lessening of affectation in speech or actions occurs 17 times. The revision almost always follows Lady Bradshaigh's written suggestion: "Then kissed, instead of my hand, which I withdrew, my offered cheek" to "Then kissed, my offered cheek" (p. 18*); "I then threw myself at his feet; embraced his knees" to "I then threw myself into his Arms" (p. 26); "Sir Edward, on one knee, thus bespoke her" to "Sir Edward thus bespoke her" (p. 53*). In some of the matters of propriety, Lady Bradshaigh did not suggest the rewording but expressed her objections by comments in the margin. She considered Sir Charles's action improper in this situation: "At our alighting, Sir Charles clasping me in his arms, I congratulate you, my dearest life" (p. 17). At the bottom of the page, Lady Bradshaigh wrote, "Should it not have been first to Lady W: both as to rank, &amp; Equally a Stranger." Richardson added the words "attended to." The reading in the fourth edition is expanded: "At our alighting, Sir Charles (after paying his compliments in a most respectful manner to Lady W.[) ] clasping me in his arms, I congratulate you, my dearest life" (p. 18*). A marginal comment of Lady Bradshaigh's on page 22 brought about another of the revisions in the fourth edition. In his description of a bedchamber, Richardson includes two portraits. Lady Bradshaigh commented, "No pictures in a hung Bedchamber but over doors &amp; chimney." To this remark, Richardson added, "Thank you, thank you, Madam." In the revision which appears in the 1756 issue, the pictures are removed from the bedchamber and hung in the dining room. Several of Lady Bradshaigh's suggestions may be considered matters of style. The shifting of a phrase, changing of a word to one more exact or more appropriate, deletion of an awkward or unnecessary phrase or clause, and sentence revision account for sixteen of her suggestions that Richardson followed. Lady Bradshaigh must have given careful attention to her task. In the first three editions Harriet writes that Mrs. Eleanor Grandison "will be delighted . . . in attending, in the absence of the fathers and mothers, the dear little infants of her two nieces [Lady L. and Lady G.]" (p. 198). Lady Bradshaigh wrote in the margin, "How can they leave their Infants, do we not after this, find them nursers?" In Richardson's handwriting is the reply: "Thank you, Thank you, Madam. How indeed! O the blunderer!" In the fourth edition (1756) the sentence does not appear. Besides the 64 changes for which Lady Bradshaigh is responsible, there are 86 others in the fourth edition of Volume VII. All are consistent with Richardson's revisions in the second and third editions. Included are changes in grammar and diction such as subject and verb agreement, shift in the position of an adverb, the addition or deletion of a word or phrase, sentence revision, and the deletion of awkward or unneecssary expressions. Seven times in the fourth edition there is a retrenchment of affected redundancy: "dear Sir, I find, I find" to "dear Sir, I find" (p. 81*); "Why, why, this" to "Why this" (p. 85*). The modification of affectation, another frequent change in the third edition, occurs five times in addition to the 17 suggested by Lady Bradshaigh. Two examples indicate the nature of the changes: "How poor a return, hiding my face in his generous bosom, is my Love for so much goodness" to "How poor a return is my Love for so much goodness" (p. 81*); "Again the two Lords looked upon each other, as admiring me" to "Again the two Lords looked upon each other, as in admiration" (p. 159*).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Until 1810 all editions of Grandison followed the fourth, but in this year there was published an edition which made on the title page the unequivocal claim to be "A NEW EDITION, WITH THE LAST CORRECTIONS BY THE AUTHOR." 8 The evidence that this edition was based on a text revised by Richardson is considerable. Two of Richardson's letters and one written by his daughter Anne mention revised texts. The earliest reference is in Richardson's letter to Mrs. Mary Watts, April 9, 1755: I have told our good brother Jeronymo [a Mr. Lefevre] the reason why I am sollicitous to have the faults in my printed writings marked by my kind friends. It is this: I have laid by a copy of each, with such corrections in them as my friends, or my own reperusal, have suggested to me, in case, after my demise, new editions should be called for: and, as any thing of this sort occurs, I put it down in its proper place. Hence it is that real service is done me by the task performed, which I put upon my kind friends, and the more faults they find the better they answer my intention. 9 Richardson's second reference to a revised text appears in a letter to Johannes Stinstra, November 26, 1755: "I have also given my last Hand to Clarissa and Grandison; which, however, vary but little from y e last Edition of these Works: But I was willing to amuse my self between whiles, while I attended Workmen in their Building for me new Printing Offices." 10 On April 12, 1792, Anne Richardson wrote to her niece Mrs. Moodie that she had her father's "altered Copy" of Grandison . Why this revision was not published in the eighteenth century cannot be explained altogether satisfactorily, but there is a partial explanation. William Richardson, Samuel's nephew, succeeded to the printing business shortly after Richardson's death. The relations between Richardson's daughters and their cousin were not good. As a part of their inheritance, the daughters received their father's manuscripts. Anne and her sister Martha Bridgen had hoped that at some time a new edition of Richardson's works would be called for and that they would be able to make a fair sum of money, but these hopes came to nothing. Long before 1792 Anne realized there was little likelihood of any financial gain. In the letter to Mrs. Moodie in which she referred to having a corrected Grandison , she wrote that the family had been refused any recompense years before, and she was sure that nothing would be likely to come in the future. 11 What Anne did with the copy of Grandison is not known. She died in 1803. There are several other items that strongly suggest the existence of a revised Grandison . One of these is the corrected copy that belonged to Lady Bradshaigh. Since 64 of the 150 changes in Volume VII of the fourth edition (1756 and 1762) were suggested by Lady Bradshaigh, it seems unlikely that Richardson would have ignored all her suggestions in the other volumes. And it is clear from Richardson's letter to Sir Roger and Lady Bradshaigh dated July 9, 1754, that she did make suggestions in all volumes: "O my dear, my good Sir R. I hope to live to thank you both in person. You , for permitting my Lady to part with books made so much more valuable by her remarks, than any 50 sets of the same could be, ever so richly adorned. My Lady , for so many kind Marks, by her Hand-writing in almost every page of her Attention to the history" (Forster MS XI, foll. 110-111). However, Volume VII is the only one of the seven that has been found, and Richardson's adoption of some of her other suggestions in Volumes I-VI can only be assumed. Richardson remarked to Stinstra that he had given his last hand to Clarissa and Grandison and that they varied "but little from y e last Edition of these Works." The fact is that no edition of Grandison varies much from any other edition. Including all kinds of changes, there are 928 in the second edition, 932 in the third, and 150 in Volume VII of the fourth (1756 and 1762). All types of changes in Volumes I-VII of the 1810 edition total 605 (excluding readings that agree with an edition earlier than the fourth). Since many of the 605 changes in the 1810 edition are one word revisions, there is not a very great difference between the 1810 text and the earlier ones. It is not necessary to accept Richardson's statement that he had given his last hand to Clarissa and Grandison in 1755. He had earlier revised his novels almost ceaselessly and may well have revised further even after he thought that his revision was complete. He kept Lady Bradshaigh's copy of Grandison until January, 1758, and as late as March, 1761, shortly before his death, asked Lady Bradshaigh to send him her copies of Pamela and Clarissa so that he could read her suggestions "with Liberty to add to new ones of his own such of your Ladiship's, as may make y e future Edition [of Pamela] more perfect than otherwise it can be." The revised Pamela was published in 1801. 12 Although the eighteenth-century editions of Grandison after 1762 follow the fourth, the evidence is clear that the 1810 was set from an edition earlier than the fourth. Of the 955 differences between the fourth and the 1810, 349 agree with the earlier editions. Several items point to the third edition as the set Richardson used for his master copy. First of all, an edition containing his latest changes would have greatly simplified his task of marking up a revised text. Secondly, the cancelled version of Dr. Bartlett's difficulty with the Venetian authorities (II, 348-349) appears in the third edition and is followed exactly in the 1810 edition. Finally, of the 349 readings in the 1810 edition that are like those of an edition earlier than the fourth, 307 agree with the third. An examination of the 42 readings that are like the first or second edition but unlike the third shows that the third edition readings are changes that were probably made by compositors. With a third edition master copy, Richardson could easily have corrected the compositor's changes by restoring the reading of the first or second edition at the same time that he was making his revisions. A number of third edition readings are certainly errors: the first and 1810 editions have "Her Lord, and his brother," referring to the Marchese della Porretta and the Conte della Porretta, whereas the third has "Her Lord, and her brother" (III, 315; 330); the first and 1810 editions refer to Sir Charles's plan to leave England on "Saturday," while the third has "Friday" (IV, 153; 163) — Letter xxiii, dated " Saturday Morning , Apr. 15," begins, "O Lucy, Sir Charles Grandison is gone! Gone indeed! He sat out at three this morning"; the first and 1810 editions read "that Sir Charles, crossing the walk which I had just before quitted, stooped, and took up a paper," while the third has "stopped," and three lines later all editions read "That must be what he stooped for, and took up" (VI, 153-154; 162). Volume VII of the 1810 edition presents problems. Fourteen of Lady Bradshaigh's suggestions which Richardson followed in the fourth edition do not appear in the 1810 edition. In each case the reading of the 1810 agrees with that of the third edition. Several of these suggestions and revisions are single word changes, but one of them is of some importance. Following her advice on the proper place for pictures, Richardson shifted a passage and made revisions in other places so that the pictures that had improperly hung in the bedchamber in the first three editions hang in the dining-room in the fourth edition. His comment in the margin of Lady Bradshaigh's copy makes it clear that he was grateful to her for calling his attention to this impropriety. It surely seems that this revision of the fourth edition would have appeared in Richardson's final revised copy, but in the 1810 edition the pictures are back in the bedchamber. The most likely explanation for the inconsistencies between the fourth and the 1810 editions of Volume VII is that Richardson used all seven volumes of a third edition for his master copy and that he failed to transfer some of the fourth edition revisions into his revised set. The revisions in the 1810 edition are similar to those in the previous editions: words italicized for the first time (16); added parentheses or brackets (4); a change in the number or mood of the verb (3); a change in the principal part of the verb (7); the elimination of a preposition at the end of a clause (1); a change in verb tense (8); the change of a single word to one more appropriate or exact (88); revision for agreement of subject and verb and of pronoun and antecedent (3); addition of words and phrases for clarity or emphasis (13); deletion of words and phrases (64); the rewording or shifting of phrases, clauses, and sentences for clarity, parallel structure, or logical comparison (22); a change in the form of title or address (72); deletion of affected repetition (5); deletion or change of indelicate or affected words (20); a reduction of immodesty, indelicacy, or affectation (75); the addition of a footnote (1); and corrections, particularly of dates. There are several changes in the 1810 edition from the subjunctive to the indicative mood: "I wish the night were over" to "I wish the night was over" (I, 160; 170). Where a single word is changed, as in the earlier editions, the 1810 reading is frequently a word that is more elevated, more exact, or more appropriate: "who hones after the country" to "who pines after the country" (I, 241; 256); "Mr. Reeves's servant led them . . . into the parlour" to "Mr. Reeves's servant shewed them . . . into the parlour" (II, 94; 99); "tho' he adores you for a friend" to "though he admires you for a friend" (IV, 224-225; 237). Consistent with the previous editions is the addition of a word or phrase for clarity: "The Bride-maids, one by one, waited on her to her chamber" to "The bride-maids, one by one to be the less observed, waited on her to her chamber" (VI, 345; 361); "Let me enumerate a few chances that may render a first Love impracticable" to "Let me enumerate a few chances that may render the success of a first love impracticable" (VII, 214; 225). The deletion of words and phrases is another common revision: "If any considerations of family prudence (there are such, and very just ones) restrain you" to "If any considerations of family prudence restrain you" (IV, 36; 38); "How will Harriet answer to the question" to "How will Harriet answer the question" (VI, 31; 33). Richardson's revision in editions before the 1810 includes the rewording of phrases and clauses for greater clarity, emphasis, logical comparison, or parallel structure. Such revisions occur in the 1810 edition: "If ever man doted upon a woman, said Mr. Bagenhall, it is Sir Hargrave on Miss Byron" to "If ever man doted upon a woman, said Mr. Bagenhall, Sir Hargrave dotes on Miss Byron" (II, 25-26; 27); "And when I began to look for it, to oblige you, I could not find it" to "and when, to oblige you, I began to look for it, I could not find it" (III, 222; 232). In the third edition a revision of title or form of address occurs 16 times; there are 18 in Volume VII of the fourth edition (1762). The 1810 edition has 72 such revisions, many of which are exactly like those of the earlier editions: "the dear creature" to "my cousin" (I, 171; 182); "the dear creature" to "she" (I, 177; 188); "the good Dr. Bartlett" to "Dr. Bartlett" (II, 307; 323) "most excellent of women" to "madam" (V, 221; 235); "Grandpapa" to "grandfather" (II, 3). Revisions which delete or modify immodest, indelicate, or affected speech or action account for 75 of the changes in the 1810 edition, but not even in this edition are all the passages of immoderate praise modified or deleted. A few disappear: "The Marquis made me a high compliment" (V, 236; 251); "We all of us, Lady L. have the happiness of being beloved by high and low" (VI, 326; 342). From "You know, my dear Lady L. how much I love to praise my brother. Neither I, nor the young Ladies, not even those who had humble servants present, regarded any-body but him" the second sentence is dropped (VI, 339; 356). Closely related to the revisions of immodest, indelicate, or affected speech and action are those that delete or modify unrestrained, immoderate behavior. It was not until the third edition that Richardson began to make revisions of this type. A number occur in Volume VII of the fourth edition; 27 in the 1810: "I wept on her neck; I could not help it" to "I was greatly moved" (III, 47; 49); "My Lord G. kissed her hand with a bent knee" to "My Lord G. with transport saluted her" (IV, 120; 127); "in a very earnest manner, snatching my hand, and wetting it with his tears" to "in a very earnest manner, snatching my hand" (V, 228; 243); "He cast himself at my feet" to "He approached me with tender respect" (VI, 261; 275); "and, clasping her arms about my neck, hid her blushing face in my bosom" to "and clasped her arms about my neck" (VI, 347; 363). Of course someone else could have made the revisions in grammar, phrasing, and propriety. There are, however, three kinds of revision that appear to be such that no one but Richardson would have made. These are the correction of discrepancies in time or dates, the addition of a footnote, and the rearrangement of the order of events. Date changes occur in two of the revised editions before 1810: seven occur in the second and seven in the third. In the 1810 edition there are fifteen. Some of the date corrections indicate a very close reading of the text, for the discrepancies may be pages apart. In a letter written by Bagenhall, Sir Hargrave's hapless companion, a discrepancy in the order of events remains unchanged through the fourth edition. The first edition reads, "I went to Sir Charles's house yesterday afternoon" (I, 277). In the 1810 edition, he writes, "I went to Sir Charles's house this afternoon" (I, 294). In the letter preceding Bagenhall's, Harriet writes to Lucy Selby, "She [Charlotte Grandison] added, that this morning ( Saturday ) they [Charlotte and Sir Charles] should both set out for Colnebrooke" (I, 273). Bagenhall's letter is dated February 25, a Saturday. The purpose of his visit to Sir Charles was to give him Sir Hargrave's challenge. He handed the letter to Sir Charles as the brother and sister were stepping into the coach for the journey to Colnebrooke. In Volume V of the 1810 edition there are changes in dates in three of a series of four letters. Letter xix, dated August 1 in the first four editions, is a letter from Charlotte's father-in-law, the Earl of D., urging her and Lord G. to return to London. In the first four editions Charlotte's reply, Letter xx, is headed " Selby-house , Aug. 4." Letter xxi to Harriet Byron is written by Charlotte after she returns to London and is dated August 5. Harriet's reply to the August 5 letter is dated July 24 in the first four editions. In the 1810 edition, Letter xix is dated July 28, and Charlotte's reply to the earl is dated July 30. The date of her letter from London remains August 5, but Harriet's answer to this letter is dated August 8. The reasons for the changes in dates may be found in the contents of the letters. In her note to the earl, Charlotte writes, "I will soon throw myself at your feet; and by the next post will fix the day on which I hope to be forgiven by you both" (p. 120). This statement in a letter dated August 4 is contradicted by the following letter written by Charlotte in London on August 5. The August 5 date implies that she has made a sixty-mile journey (Selby-house is near Northampton), received a call from the Countess of D., and moved into her new home between the time she wrote the note to the earl on August 4 and the time she wrote to Harriet August 5. Letter xxii, dated July 24, is clearly a reply to Charlotte's letter dated August 5. A correction of this error to August 8 in the 1810 edition allows time for Harriet to receive Charlotte's letter and to write a reply. 13 Another change in the 1810 edition corrects the time, although there are no specific dates involved. Bagenhall is forced to marry a woman of Abbeville whom he has seduced. The marriage is referred to in a letter written by Charlotte, dated May 8 (IV, 269). From a letter of Harriet's, it is clear that Bagenhall was in England as late as March (II, 105) and therefore could not have met the woman any earlier than this date. However, in a letter dated October 26 (VI, 201) there are two passages on page 215 that make his wife's wretched condition worse than it could have been: "his wife, and an unhealthy child, and she big with another, turned out of doors" and "The poor woman wishing but for means to transport herself and child to her mean friends at Abbeville." In the 1810 edition these read "his wife big with child turned out of doors" and "the poor woman wishing but for means to transport herself to her mean friends at Abbeville" (p. 226). The length of time from Bagenhall's first meeting with his wife to his abandonment of her is about seven months. The one footnote added in the 1810 edition is interesting because it restores a sentence that does not appear in the third and fourth editions. In the debate between Harriet and Mr. Walden on languages and learning, Harriet says, in the first and second editions, "Then, Sir, I have been taught to think, that a learned man and a linguist may very well be two persons: In other words, That science, or knowlege, and not language merely, is learning" (I, 66). In the third and fourth editions, the last clause was deleted (I, 67). A footnote in the 1810 edition restores Harriet's observation (I, 70). The most extensive revision in the 1810 edition occurs in Letter xliii of Volume VII. In Letter xli (p. 199) Harriet writes Lady G. (Charlotte) that the young ladies of Selby-house have appealed to Lady G. through Harriet to give them her view upon the subject of a "first passion." Included with her letter to Charlotte is the one from Lucy Selby to Harriet headed Letter xlii. In her reply to Harriet, Charlotte encloses a letter addressed to the girls at Selby-house. This enclosure does not have a separate letter number or date. In all but the 1810 edition Charlotte, after referring to the enclosure addressed to the girls, relates an account of Lord G.'s surprise visit to the nursery while she is feeding her baby. The purpose of this anecdote is to make it seem that the role of motherhood has served to bring Lord and Lady G. to an unsurpassable height of married bliss. Following this narrative, Charlotte in all editions before 1810 continues: But, that I may seem only to have changed the object , not wholly to have parted with my levity, read the inclosed here, in answer to the appeal of the young people; directed thus: Lady G. To Miss LUCY SELBY, And the rest of the Girls at Selby-house, Greeting . (p. 213) Then the letter to the girls begins. In the 1810 edition, the enclosure to the girls at Selby-house precedes the section that relates the nursery scene (p. 224). There is more involved than a shifting about of the two parts of Letter xliii. In the 1810 edition, following Charlotte's enclosure to the girls, there is an added passage: LADY G. TO LADY GRANDISON By way of postscript to the above . April 20. Shameful negligence! The inclosed to the girls at Selby-house, not yet gone — How have I raved at the carelessness! — Written, as it was , in a state of rebellion with my prescribing women, to so little purpose so early. — I had a good mind, as I told them, to renounce their cares and their caudle, and go abroad — In short, to set out for Grandison-hall, and make one among the exotics and naturals there, though ye were to shut your gates against me — "Dear madam, forgive us — It was not a designed omission — It was not our fault — But" — Well then, give me my pen and ink, and interrupt me not — And now, my Harriet, I will give you a scene that will not be a very impertinent supplement to the subject on which the chits at Selby-house have provoked me to write. — (p. 232) The reason for the rearrangement of the two parts of the letter in the 1810 edition seems to be that the long discussion among the women and girls at Selby-house in Letter xlii should be closely followed by Charlotte's views on the subject. To make the shift, however, it was necessary to add material so that the two parts would be logically linked. The language of Charlotte's postscript is typical of her style and it is hard to believe that anyone but Richardson wrote it. Six of Lady Bradshaigh's suggestions appear for the first time in the 1810 edition. In some cases, the sugestions are followed in part in the fourth and altogether in the 1810. First edition: What a compliment does my dearest younger sister make to her elder? (VII, 88) Fourth edition: What a compliment does my dearest younger Sister make me? (VII, 88) 1810 edition: What a compliment does my dearest sister make me! (VII, 95) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: The words "younger" and "to her elder" are struck through; "me" is written on the line above and after "make." First edition: What, my dear, makes Charlotte so impatient (so petulant I had almost said) under a circumstance, which, if attended with a happy issue, will lay all us, her friends, under obligation to her? (VII, 132) Fourth edition: [as in the first] (VII, 132) 1810 edition: What . . . happy issue, will give joy to all her friends? (VII, 141) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: In the margin she wrote, "obligation again." Richardson replied, "I wonder your Ladship [sic] should except to this high piece of Gallantry. I want to have your Sex, when in the way of their Duty, encouraged." First edition: that glorious Enthusiasm (VII, 136) Fourth edition: [as in the first] (VII, 136) 1810 edition: that enthusiasm (VII, 146) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: The word "glorious" is struck through. First edition: I sent a note begging the favour of my cousin Reeves's company to supper; apologizing, by the occasion, for the short notice. (VII, 161) Fourth edition: I sent a note, begging the favour of my Cousin Reeves's company to supper; apologizing for the short notice. (VII, 161) 1810 edition: I sent a note, begging the favour of my cousin Reeves's company to supper. (VII, 172) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: The words "apologizing, by the occasion, for the short notice" are struck through. First edition: My dearest Friend, my Lover, my Husband , every tender word in one, left his noble guests for their sakes early last night. . . . (VII, 165) Fourth edition: My Sir Charles left his noble friends for their sakes early last night. . . . (VII, 165) 1810 edition: Sir Charles left his noble friends for their sakes early last night. . . . (VII, 176) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: The following words are struck through: "My dearest Friend, my Lover, my Husband , every tender word in one"; "Sir Charles" is written in. Very likely the "My" was supposed to be left out of the fourth edition, but the striking out was probably unclear in the copy the compositor had. First edition: the rest of our noble guests are to embark (VII, 285) Fourth edition: they are to embark (VII, 285) 1810 edition: the rest are to embark (VII, 304) Lady Bradshaigh's copy: The words "our noble guests" are struck through. In his letter of April 9, 1755, to Mrs. Watts, quoted above, Richardson goes on to refer to some of her particular remarks about Grandison . One of his references, in connection with the scene of Charlotte in the nursery, is specific: "But is Lady G.'s crowing child no more than a fortnight old? This was rather an inattention than anything else. I protest, I thought it two or three months old at least." The earlier editions read: "I bowed my face on the smiling infant, who crowed to the pressure of my lip." In 1810 "crowed" is corrected to "seemed to crow" (VII, 211; 234). Less than a year before his death Richardson received a letter from three anonymous admirers, Ethelinda, Charlotte, and Henrietta. They have one fault to find: Sir Charles uses the name of God as an expletive. How does such a good man as Richardson solve the usage to himself? They cite two passages, one in which the hero says, "Would to God," and one in which the heroine says, "Lord Bless me." 14 In 1810 the first is altered to "Would to heaven" (V, 231; 246), but the second is unchanged (IV, 66; 70). The similarity of the 1810 revisions to these suggestions by friends and admirers and to the revisions in the earlier editions suggests the reliability of the 1810 edition. The only evidence against the 1810 edition is the omission of fourteen of Lady Bradshaigh's suggestions which Richardson had followed in the fourth edition of Volume VII. The best explanation, as I have already said, is that Richardson used a third edition for his master copy and this revised set did not include some of the revisions he had made for the fourth edition of Volume VII. One thing is clear. The 1810 edition was printed from a text that had undergone authoritative revision, even though incomplete. The editions of Grandison after 1762 follow the text of the fourth edition. A seven-volume edition following the text of the fourth appeared in 1811. But after a lapse of forty-eight years and several editions, a text unlike any previous one was published. That the 1810 edition was set from Anne Richardson's copy cannot be conclusively proved, but it is highly probable. The facts that she wanted to see her father's revised works published, that she did see Pamela published in 1801, and that she had a revised copy of Grandison as late as 1792 lead almost inescapably to the conclusion that the 1810 edition was set from a copy that had Richardson's revisions, as its title page claims. I conclude that a text of Sir Charles Grandison which would most nearly represent Richardson's final intention would include the substantive changes in the second, third, and 1810 editions as well as those which occur in Volume VII of the fourth edition (1762). Since Richardson was his own printer, the question of which edition should be used as a copy-text is not always as readily answered as it is for most authors. But in the case of Sir Charles Grandison it is simplified by the facts that the first two editions were published simultaneously, the third edition was printed at various presses, and the later editions were posthumous. The first edition (including the cancellans of Volume II, pp. 349-350) should, therefore, be used as the copy-text, since the revised editions may easily contain compositors' errors. Alterations in italics, brackets, and parentheses should be considered as substantive changes, since there is reason to think that Richardson intentionally revised in these respects. In general the changes in Sir Charles Grandison , though slight, are improvements. Some of them remove inconsistencies and improbabilities; other remove some (though not enough) of the affected and excessive behavior; still others tend to elevate the language and to remove improprieties. Whereas in Pamela such changes tending to make the characters more elegant weaken the original conception of the simple heroine, in Sir Charles Grandison they are consistent with the station of the characters and with the tone of the book.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Gibbon's Revision of the Decline and Fall by Patricia B. Craddock</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Edward Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-1788) has been through many editions and the hands of a number of learned and industrious editors, no edition appears to have incorporated the manuscript changes in the history made by Gibbon himself in five of the six volumes of the British Museum copy with the shelf-mark C.60 m.1. In this new material, anyone familiar with Gibbon's manuscripts will recognize not only his hand but also several idiosyncratic devices for signalling additions and corrections to his text, and anyone familiar with Gibbon's style will recognize his manner. In addition to correcting 50-100 errors in accidentals, Gibbon made fourteen substantive changes in this copy. Although these changes are few in comparison with the total bulk of the Decline and Fall , they provide valuable evidence of Gibbon's way of working and of the kinds of second thoughts which would have influenced a full-scale revision of his history. Because there are no significant variations in the hand, ink, or pen of these annotations, presumably they were all made at the same time. If so, that time must have been after 1788, when volumes IV-VI of the composite edition Gibbon annotated were published. But the bulk of the added material is in the first chapter of Volume I, where Gibbon's copy is from the 1782 edition. If the hypothesis that all the notes were made at the same time is discounted, it is possible, of course, that annotations in Volume I and in Volume II (1781 edition) were made before 1788. A specious substance is lent to this possibility by Gibbon's preface to volumes I-III in the octavo edition of 1783, in which he explains that he has considered but rejected the idea of revising these three completed volumes for the new edition. In 1783 he was still writing new volumes for his history; the last three volumes were not published, in fact, until 1788. He "preferred the pleasures of composition and study to the minute diligence of revising a former publication," he said in that preface, and he was "unwilling to injure or offend the purchasers of the preceding editions" by revising this one. 1 One might conclude, then, that the revisions in Volumes I and II were begun at this request of his publisher, and dropped because they interested him less than did the writing of new volumes. But the inference is weakened by the fact that his publishers also suggested his revising the work on several other occasions. One of these is recorded in 1789, when Gibbon at last had all six volumes before him. If we can know why Gibbon began to annotate his history but abandoned the revision, the correspondence with his publisher following the 1789 request is most likely to tell us. The fluctuations of ambition there recorded are consistent with those implicit in the changes and with the appearance and distribution of the annotations. On February 11, 1789, Gibbon wrote to his publisher, Thomas Cadell: I do not propose making any improvements or corrections in the octavo edition [of volumes IV-VI] which you meditate: some slight alterations would give me more trouble than pleasure. A thorough revision of the whole work would be the labour of many months; it may be the amusement of my old age, and will be a valuable legacy, to renew your copy-right at the expiration of the last fourteen years . . . . Since my return I have been, as I promise in the preface [of 1788], very busy and very idle in my library: several ideal works have been embraced and thrown aside; but if the warm weather should ripen any project to form and maturity, you may depend on the earliest intelligence. 2 That "earliest intelligence" came, however, not with the warm weather, but after a delay of nearly two years. On November 17, 1790, another letter to Cadell suggests an intervening favorable consideration of the idea of revision: As I am inclined to flatter myself that you have no reason to be displeased with your purchase, I now wish to ask you whether you feel yourself disposed to add a seventh, or supplemental volume to my History? The materials of which it will be composed will naturally be classed under the three following heads: 1. A series of fragments, disquisitions, digressions, &amp;c more or less connected with the principal subject. 2. Several tables of geography, chronology, coins, weights and measures, &amp;c; nor should I despair of obtaining from a gentleman at Paris some accurate and well-adapted maps. 3. A critical review of all the authors whom I have used and quoted. I am convinced such a supplement might be rendered entertaining, as well as useful; and that few purchasers would refuse to complete their Decline and Fall. But as the writer could not derive either fame or amusement from these obscure labours, he must be encouraged by other motives; and, in plain English, I should expect the same reward for the seventh, as for any of the preceding volumes. You think and act with too much liberality, to confound such a large original supplement with the occasional improvements of a new edition, which are already your property by the terms of our former covenant. But as I am jealous of standing clear, not only in law and equity, but in your esteem and my own, I shall instantly renounce the undertaking, if it appears by your answer that you have the shadow of an objection. Should you tempt me to proceed, this supplement will be only the employment of my leisure hours; and I foresee that full two years will elapse before I can deliver it into the hands of the printer. ( Letters , III,209-210) Two months later, however, before Cadell had replied to the proposal, Gibbon had again grown cold toward the idea, favoring instead other historical projects he was then at work upon. He wrote to Cadell, "I am curious to know your opinion concerning the nature and value of a seventh or supplemental Volume of my history: but I much doubt whether any prospect of advantage will now tempt me to undertake a work which cannot be productive either of amusement or reputation to the author" ( Letters , III,211). The nature and distribution of the changes themselves support the hypothesis that they were made and abandoned on such a series of impulses as is implied in the letters to Cadell. Although Chapter I, Volume I, is by far the most heavily annotated part of the work, the annotations, small matters both of accidentals and of substantives, are most widely diffused in Volume VI, as if Gibbon had read through it looking for errors of the press and such "slight alterations" as he owed and had before given to Cadell. The substantive changes in Volumes II, IV, and V are the sort that might previously have occurred to Gibbon while "very busy and very idle in his library," without his intending a thorough revision. But Chapter I contains changes obviously prompted by the rereading and rethinking necessary for thorough revision or for such a miscellaneous seventh volume as he proposed. It contains, moreover, a note to himself about an addition not actually written there which could only have been designed for a supplementary volume. In the second paragraph, the words "a rapid succession of triumphs" are underlined, and parallel to that paragraph, he wrote in the margin, "Excursion 1, on the succession of Roman triumphs ." No doubt this was intended to remind him to write or to include the essay on the succession of Roman triumphs which occupies pages 359-393 of the fourth volume of Lord Sheffield's 1814 edition of Gibbon's Miscellaneous Works . One may surmise, then, that in the winter of 1790/91, he read through the sixth volume at length, made a few especially obvious changes in other volumes, and began systematically to revise the work from the beginning, only to be defeated or discouraged, as he was in all his other literary works of these last years (Gibbon died in January, 1794) by the fact that, as he put it, "un objet interessant s'étend et s'aggrandit sous le travail" and that "Le souvenir de ma servitude de vingt ans m'a . . . effrayé et je me suis bien promis de ne plus m'embarquer dans une entreprise de longue haleine, que je n'acheverois vraisemblablement jamais" ( Letters , III, 204, 203). Although he frequently undertook ambitious literary projects, and pursued them enthusiastically and energetically for a time, none, after the Decline and Fall , was completed to his own satisfaction, except his reluctant Vindication of the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters. Within these annotations there is explicit as well as implicit evidence that he knew they too were an ambitious project. In one of the first he remarked, "Mr. Hume told me that in correcting his history, he always laboured to reduce superlatives, and soften positives." Hume's is a general principle designed to assist a thorough revision; it would have been irrelevant if Gibbon had thought only of correcting the most egregious errors. Indeed, Gibbon had long before distinguished in practice between correcting "in a minute and almost imperceptible way" ( Letters , II,110) as he had cheerfully done in the past and correcting in a thorough way, against which the interests of earlier purchasers had militated. But Gibbon's practice in these annotations, though ambitious, is by no means conformable throughout to Hume's precept. Sometimes he labours to soften positives and to reduce superlatives, sometimes he simply mutters regretfully to himself in the margin, sometimes he corrects errors of fact or emphasis, sometimes he supplies new facts or reflections, and sometimes he defies Hume's rule by making an assertion more sweeping or more bitingly ironic. As one would expect, he followed Hume's advice on the occasion when he cited it. The new restraint comes, interestingly enough, in his description of the importance of his subject. In print, the last sentence of his first paragraph had announced the aim of his history, after the characterization of the prosperity of the empire under Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines, as "to deduce the most important circumstances of [the empire's] decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth." 3 In the manuscript additions, he revised these lofty and important lines to read, "And afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to prosecute the decline and fall of the Empire of Rome: of whose language, Religion and laws the impression will be long preserved in our own, and the neighbouring countries of Europe." Having moderated his claims to his readers, he added the note in which he reminded himself of his illustrious model. This part of the material was not apparently intended for publication (none of his usual means of indicating its placement in, or as a note to, the text are used), but in it he indulges the delight in grandeur which, throughout his work, corrects and complements his love of precision and distaste for exaggeration. "N.B.," he began, and then recorded both Hume's advice and his own reflections: "Mr. Hume told me that in correcting his history, he always laboured to reduce superlatives, and soften positives. Have Asia and Africa, from Japan to Morocco, any feeling or memory of the Roman Empire?" The rhetorical exaggeration by which "ever" was originally used instead of "long" and "nations of the earth" instead of "countries of Europe" was hardly seriously misleading (though his adversaries had split finer hairs); his primary concern seems, therefore, to have been rhetorical tact, not historical accuracy. From the vantage point of acknowledged success, he could prefer to appear restrained, rather than hyperbolic, in his initial statement of the significance of his work. Second thoughts sometimes, however, engendered not merely rhetorical restraint, but new caution about his conclusions and their foundations, his utilization of his sources. In the printed versions, he showed little hesitation in committing what J. B. Black calls the "crime of combining evidence derived from different periods in order to fill out the paucity of information available on the subject he happened to be handling," 4 the fault in the practice of his craft most universally condemned in Gibbon. In the seventh paragraph of the first chapter, for example, he had said, "The first exploits of Trajan were against the Dacians, the most warlike of men, who dwelt beyond the Danube, and who, during the reign of Domitian, had insulted with impunity the Majesty of Rome. To the strength and fierceness of Barbarians, they added a contempt for life, which was derived from a warm persuasion of the immortality and transmigration of the soul" (I,5). The note for this passage was only, "Herodotus, 1. iv. c. 94. Julian in the Cæsars, with Spanheim's observations" (Notes, ii). In the revision, he planned to retain this passage, but to add a note embodying the reasons for his original confidence and his new reservations: Julian assigns this Theological cause of whose power he himself might be conscious (Caesares p. 327.) Yet I am not assured that the Religion of Zamolxis subsisted in the time of Trajan, or that his Dacians were the same people with the Getæ of Herodotus. The transmigration of the Soul has been believed by many nations, warlike as the Celts, or pusillanimous like the Hindoos. When speculative opinion is kindled into practical enthusiasm, its operation will be determined by the prævious character of the man or the nation. It is interesting to see that Gibbon had begun to distrust the practice for which he was to be condemned; he hesitated, even with Julian's authority, to combine the testimony of Herodotus (fifth century B.C.) and that of Julian (fourth century A.D.) to draw conclusions about the Dacians of Trajan's time (c. 52-118). Julian was influenced by his own experience, Gibbon points out with his usual dry irony, in finding this conclusion probable. But Gibbon's experience, especially his literary experience, forced him to recognize a different standard of probability, as his last two sentences show. The rhetoric is assured; he propounds an axiom. But the axiom itself is moderate compared to that he might have propounded in earlier moods of zealous contempt for zeal. He now seems resigned to the recognition that enthusiasm, or excessive zeal, is not always caused by religious faith or accompanied by destructive effects. In the Decline and Fall he had gone so far as to admit (in a footnote) that "in his way, Voltaire was a bigot, an intolerant bigot" (Chapter LXVII, note 13). But in this revision he apparently had accepted as a rule, not the exception, the absence of a predictable correlation between zeal and destruction, moderation and achievement; the operation of either is determined by the underlying character of the man or nation. Whether he interpreted Hume's advice to include reconsideration of conclusions drawn from a priori assumptions about human behavior, or whether his own increasing knowledge of historical diversity forced him to such reconsiderations, their product would certainly have required a seventh volume and two years, at the most optimistic estimate. The revisions reveal not only new questioning of his procedures and conclusions, but also new candor about doubts concealed in the printed text. Whereas before Gibbon had felt free simply to rely upon his sense of the probable, even when silently concealing the opposition of a usually trusted source, now he seems inclined to admit and explain his problem and its resolution. No fact is in dispute, but in the third paragraph of the first chapter, a fact occurs which had been explained by Tacitus, a favorite source, in a way which seemed illegitimate to Gibbon. The Decline and Fall as printed says that Augustus "bequeathed, as a valuable legacy to his successors, the advice of confining the empire within those limits, which Nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries" (I,3). In it Gibbon gives no hint of Tacitus' theory about Augustus' motives. The new note reveals both what Tacitus thought and why Gibbon was reluctant to accept it: "Incertum metu an per invidiam (Tacit. Annal. I. 11) Why must rational advice be imputed to a base or foolish motive? To what cause, error, malevolence or flattery shall I ascribe this unworthy alternative? Was the historian dazzled by Trajan's conquests?" Here Gibbon questions the reliability of a source, albeit only on a matter of interpretation, on the grounds that the source might well be prejudiced and that general experience of human nature leads one to object to the source's conclusion. Gibbon's principle, that rational advice ought not to be attributed to base motives without evidence, is candidly admitted in the revision; it was silently acted upon in the original text, though Gibbon preserved in the next paragraph both his own and Tacitus' opinion about the motivation by ascribing them respectively to Augustus and to his successors ("the moderate system recommended by the wisdom of Augustus, was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors"). The new frankness is both more accurate and more tentative than the original smooth compromise. Gibbon did not confine his revision to moderating generalizations to allow for particular cases, however; in one instance, he corrected his own injustice to mankind's general standard of judgment. In the eighth paragraph of Chapter I, Gibbon had said, "Trajan was ambitious of fame; and as long as mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors, the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of the most exalted characters" (I,6). Here, after changing "characters" to "minds," he added a manuscript note: "The first place in the temple of fame is due and is assigned to the successful heroes who had struggled with adversity; who, after signalizing their valour in the deliverance of their country have displayed their wisdom and virtue in foundation or government of a flourishing state. Such men as Moses, Cyrus, Alfred, Gustavus Vasa, Henry iv of France &amp;c." This qualification not only interrupts his indictment of humanity, but also weakens or destroys the logic of his conclusion. If mankind praises most those whose destructive activities are less important than their constructive ones, then some exalted minds or characters may long to be remembered for civil, not military, glory. Nevertheless abstract justice required the acknowledgement of this other kind of hero, if only in a note. In the same paragraph Gibbon had also overstated the influence of the poets' and historians' praise of Alexander in causing Trajan's dangerous ambitions. Surely Gibbon had to correct the injustice to that class of mankind with which he most sympathized, when he corrected the slur upon man as a whole. He had said, "The praises of Alexander, transmitted by a succession of poets and historians, had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan. Like him the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east, but he lamented with a sigh that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Philip" (I,6). The revised version is actually bolder in rhetoric, but the boldness makes Gibbon's jocularity apparent; it is interesting to see him correcting a subtle distortion such as ambiguity of tone, not just large errors of fact or changes of emphasis and opinion. The manuscript version reads: Late generations, and far distant climates may impute their calamities to the immortal author of the Iliad. The spirit of Alexander was inflamed by the praises of Achilles: and succeeding Heroes have been ambitious to tread in the footsteps of Alexander. Like him the Emperor Trajan aspired to the conquest of the East; but the Roman lamented with a sigh that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Philip. The earlier version had overstated the relationship between Trajan's ambitions and the praises given to Alexander, by making the parallel unique. The newer version corrects this fault by adding the parallel between Achilles and Alexander, and prevents a rigidly literal and didactic interpretation of the passage by means of the playful accusation against Homer. A similar concern for correction of overstatement, especially oversimplification, is shown in the only change in Volume V, a geographical emendation. In describing the realm of the Arabs he had remarked hastily that on what "is still called Algezire," "they bestowed the name of the Green Island, from a verdant cape that advances into the sea" (V,36; Chapter LI). He marked out the last five words in order to indicate a distinction still important, especially to Englishmen, by substituting, "and small isle on the western side of the bay of Gibraltar." Even the pettiest of these newly drawn or newly cautious distinctions illustrates a general historical principle of prudence and reserve; one distinction explicitly prefers that principle to a theory of historical causation popular in Gibbon's day. Gibbon may be granted the virtues of his faults, and if he is blamed for not discovering or arguing an adequate general cause for the fall of Rome, at least it must also be admitted that he did not reject the will of God as a practical historical explanation only to accept equally impractical, but more speciously scientific, facile explanations. The revisions of the first chapter provide an example of Gibbon's care to reject simplistic explanations. In the thirteenth paragraph he had said, "In all levies [of soldiers under the Republic], a just preference was given to the climates of the North over those of the South" (I,9). His new note added: The distinction of North and South is real and intelligible; and our pursuit is terminated on either side by the poles of the Earth. But the difference of East and West is arbitrary, and shifts around the globe. As the men of the North not of the West the legions of Gaul and Germany were superior to the south -eastern natives of Asia and Egypt. It is the triumph of cold over heat; which may however and has been surmounted by moral causes. His method of evaluating the doctrine is implicit in this comment. He asks himself to what extent the distinctions to be tested actually can be made; once made, what is the evidence of experience as to their validity; how did that validity operate; what limitations of the principle are observed. Thus he concludes that cold will and does triumph over heat, without being beguiled into mistaking a useful generalization for a universal law. Other substantive changes show, like those discussed above, that Gibbon would never have been content with a revision upon limited rhetorical principles, but the revisions so far can be reconciled to an extended application of Hume's principle, to matter as well as manner. The rest of the revisions cannot have been suggested by Hume's advice, either because they make the rhetoric more emphatic and sweeping or because they show Gibbon finding new material relevant to his history, not just qualifying that already within it. In the first annotation in Volume I, he expresses, almost in soliloquy, an irremediable regret that he could not radically alter the scope of his work. After changing his reference to the happy ages from Nerva through Marcus Antoninus to read, "the prosperous condition of their times," instead of "the prosperous condition of their empire" (Chapter I, first paragraph), he remarked in the margin, in another passage probably never intended for publication: Should I not have given the history of that fortunate period which was interposed between two Iron ages? Should I not have deduced the decline of the Empire from the civil Wars, that ensued after the fall of Nero or even from the tyranny which succeeded the reign of Augustus? Alas! I should: but of what avail is this tardy knowledge? Where error is irretrievable, repentance is useless. He regretted that he could not now alter the scope of his history, but it is apparent that he saw beginning his history earlier, just after Nero (d. 68 A.D.) or just after Augustus (d. 14 A.D.) as a desirable improvement, not as a new definition of the true significance of his subject. By "deduce" Gibbon always means "to bring down (a record) from or to a particular period" (OED), not "to find the cause, source, explanation (of a subsequent event) in that period." He is saying, then, that a description of the earlier times would have been relevant to his theme, not that his location of the cause of the decline of the empire had been erroneous. He does not think of himself as having redefined the thesis of his work, but only as having omitted potentially valuable support for it. As the condition of the empire after Augustus or Nero but before Nerva could not be considered relevant to a description of the "triumph of barbarism and religion," it is obvious that Gibbon, at least, did not consider that famous phrase a description of the ultimate cause of the fall of the empire. This manuscript note, then, provides new evidence of the invalidity of one popular interpretation of Gibbon's thesis. The tone of the note, regretful but calm, confirms the impression that Gibbon had discerned not an untenable thesis, but a lost opportunity, and his continuing the ambitious revision, albeit only to the end of the chapter, is itself evidence that he saw no need to despair. Many of the additions intended for publication correct and extend the factual material of the history from the knowledge Gibbon continued to acquire. Individually these factual changes are not very interesting, but together they testify to the extent and solidity of the foundation for his massive work. In Chapter I, paragraphs sixteen and seventeen, he made two additions to his already formidable account of the formation of the Roman army. The first note is added to "The heavy-armed infantry . . . was divided into ten cohorts, and fifty-five companies, under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions" (I,12). According to the new note, The composition of the Roman officers was very faulty. 1. It was late before a Tribune was fixed to each cohort. Six tribunes were chosen for the entire legion, which two of them commanded by turns (Polyb. L vi p 526 Edit Schweighœuser) for the space of two months. 2. Our long subordination from the Colonel to the Corporal was unknown. I cannot discern any intermediate ranks between the Tribune and the Centurion the Centurion, and the Manipularis or private legionary. 3 As the Tribunes were often without experience, the Centurions were often without education, mere soldiers of fortune who had risen from the ranks (eo immitior, quia toleraverat. Tacit. Annal 1.20). A body equal to eight or nine of our battalions might be commanded by half a dozen young gentlemen and fifty or sixty old serjeants. This technical aside may have seemed necessary to Gibbon because of his subsequent claim that "Such were the arts of war, by which the Roman emperors defended their extensive conquests, and preserved a military spirit, at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and despotism" (I,16). 5 Even in the printed version he had described this defect in discipline in connection with the Roman cavalry; "whenever [wealthy members of the equestrian order] embraced the profession of arms, they were immediately intrusted with a troop of horse, or a cohort of foot" (I,14). The note, number 53, attached to this passage had begun, "As in the instance of Horace and Agricola" (Notes, iii). For that casual phrase Gibbon substituted, "Quôd mihi pareret legio Romana Tribuno. (Horat Serm. L i.vi, 45); a worthy commander, of three and twenty from the schools of Athens! Augustus was indulgent to noble birth, liberis Senatorum . . . militian auspicantibus non tribunatum modo legionum sed et præfecturas alarum dedit (Sueton. C 38)." This addition, like the other military disquisition, substantiates Gibbon's remark in the Autobiography , "the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire." 6 The last addition in the first chapter is, appropriately enough, a geographical quibble; even before the idea of writing the history of Rome had occurred to him, Gibbon laboriously studied the geography of ancient Italy. This geographical remark, however, concerns Africa, not Italy, and amplifies a note explaining why he considered Mount Atlas "a name . . . idly celebrated by the fancy of poets" (I,26). Note 86 had said, "The long range, moderate height, and gentle declivity of mount Atlas (see Shaw's travels, p. 5.) are very unlike a solitary mountain which rears its head into the clouds, and seems to support the heavens. The Peak of Teneriff, on the contrary, rises a league and a half above the surface of the sea, and as it was frequently visited by the Phœnicians, might engage the notice of the Greek poets" (Notes, v). Underlining the phrase, "a league and a half above the surface of the sea," Gibbon added in the margin, "More correctly, according to Mr. Bouguer, 2500 Toises (Buffon Supplement Tom. V p 304). The height of Mont Blanc is now fixed at 2426 Toises. (Saussure Voyage dans les Alpes Tom 1 p 495): but the lowest ground from whence it can be seen is itself greatly elevated above the level of the sea. He who sails by the isle of Teneriff, contemplates the entire Pike, from the foot to the summit." Mere statistics will not induce Gibbon to forsake his intuition — but he thinks his reader should know what the statistics are. Gibbon's eagerness to add more facts to his history even manifests itself in the Preface to Volume IV, where his manuscript changes adjust a grammatical nicety and clarify Gibbon's relationship with Lord North by enumerating dates and titles. "Lord North," he had said, "will permit me to express the feelings of friendship in the language of truth: but even truth and friendship should be silent, if he still dispensed the favours of the crown" (p. iv). The last sentence is corrected to read, "should have been silent, as long as he dispensed the favours of the crown," and the position occupied by Lord North which precluded his praise in Gibbon's earlier prefaces is explained: "In the year 1776 when I published the first Volume, in 1781 when I published the second and third, Lord North was first Lord of the treasury. I was his friend and follower, a Member of parliament and a Lord of trade: but I disdained to sink the Scholar in the politician." Small improvements in accuracy and clarity, and short additions of fact, testify to Gibbon's concern for minute correctness. In Chapter LXX, he corrected an awkward and inaccurate repetition by making a clause read, "Whatever may be the private taste of a stranger, his slight and superficial knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the judgment of a learned nation," instead of "in the taste of a learned nation" (VI, 567). For the ambiguous "the brevity of their domestic annals" he substituted the clear designation, "the Mogul annals," and he added the Japanese to the list of peoples who supply information about the triumphs of the Moguls (VI,292). "Each nation will deserve credit in the relation of their own disasters and defeats," he had remarked, and added in a new marginal note, "The zeal and curiosity of Europe soon explored the Empire of the Great Khan; and the monuments of Tartar history have been illustrated by the learning of modern times" (VI,293). Together all these changes illustrate both scholarly industry and the temptation toward pedantry, between which Gibbon's erudition usually chose triumphantly. The remaining alterations tend to increase rather than to moderate the positiveness of Gibbon's assertions and the severity of his irony. The single addition in Volume II adds more vigor and immediacy to Gibbon's portrayal of the unique merit of the emperor Julian. In the last paragraph of Chapter XXII, Gibbon had remarked, "The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple, and cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity. But the personal merit of Julian was, in some measure, independent of his fortune" (II,353). In the manuscript addition Gibbon amplified his praise by scornfully contrasting the vanities of a monarch of the past and one of the present with Julian's real merit, and by finding only Frederic the Great comparable to Julian among modern rulers: Το ΤΕχνιον πασα γαια τρε was the boast and comfort of Nero the musician (Sueton. C 40). But the applause of venal or trembling crowds was dispelled by the first manifesto of the Rebels, which pronounced him a most execrable performer; (C 41) and could he have survived his descent from the throne, it is more than probable, that he would have been hissed from the stage. The present King of N 7 is satisfied that, in case of a revolution, he could subsist by the trade of a fisherman or a pastry-cook. Perhaps he would be disappointed. The amusement of an hour must not contend with the labour of a life. Frederic alone, of the monarchs of the age, was capable, like Julian, of making his own fortune. The rhetoric retains an air of restraint ("perhaps he would be disappointed"), but the praise is more emphatic, not more restrained, than in the earlier version. The longest change in Volume VI, the one that might represent his becoming interested in doing more than correcting the errors of the press, is a more dramatic expression of the credulity of the Crusaders, in Chapter LXI. He had said, "The principle of the crusades was a savage fanaticism; and the most important effects were analogous to the cause. Each pilgrim was ambitious to return with his sacred spoils, the relics of Greece and Palestine; and each relic was preceded and followed by a train of miracles and visions" (VI, 209). The reference to note 67 was placed after "Palestine," and the note read, "Such was the opinion of the great Leibnitz (Oeuvres de Fontenelle, tom. v. p. 458.), a master of the history of the middle ages. I shall only instance the pedigree of the Carmelites, and the flight of the house of Loretto, which were both derived from Palestine." He marked out the second, colorless sentence and added, after "visions" in the text itself, "A cross, or a crown of thorns might be easily transported; since the house of the Virgin Mary was carried through the air two thousand miles, from Nazareth to Loretto, a perpetual monument of priestly fraud, and popular credulity." Here he has actually deleted material (the pedigree of the Carmelites) in order to emphasize his ironic response through heightened rhetoric. Had Gibbon revised the whole Decline and Fall with the thoroughness and variety of concern which he demonstrated in the revisions of the first chapter and suggested in the other substantive changes, the results of his labors might very probably have filled more than one volume, even without the other material he proposed to Cadell. The volume would have been shapeless and chaotic, of course, in the form Gibbon envisaged, and indeed it is hard to imagine how he could have satisfied his own sense of order and rational coherence without inserting the changes directly into their original contexts. It seems significant that he never followed "Excursion 1" with an "Excursion 2." Perhaps the inherent hopelessness of dealing with material important to the Decline and Fall outside that mammoth structure sufficiently explains his abandoning the task. Perhaps too, it ought to have deterred me from attempting to describe the results of Gibbon's efforts. Certainly these changes should have been incorported in a modern edition of the history. But in the absence of such an edition, this description at least permits readers "to complete their Decline and Fall."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">James B. Pinker, who was a literary agent for such figures as Joseph Conrad, Arnold Bennett, Ford Madox Ford, John Galsworthy, A. E. Housman, Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, and H. G. Wells, took on James Joyce as a client in 1915, at Wells' suggestion, and remained his representative until his death of pneumonia during a business trip to New York in February 1922. The agency was taken over by J. B. Pinker's sons Eric, Ralph, and James, but Joyce's reliance upon the firm dwindled after the elder Pinker's death. The years that J. B. Pinker handled Joyce's affairs had seen the successful publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses as well as reissues of Chamber Music and Dubliners , while in the years following Pinker's death Joyce found himself less dependent upon the agency's services, having by then been established as an important author. Although Ezra Pound sometimes disparaged Pinker's abilities and his function in Joyce's career, liking to count himself solely responsible for Joyce's rise, Joyce had confidence in his agent, and knew him to be a better man of business than himself. It was Pinker's role not only to stand as a bulwark between Joyce and the world of business, but to dissuade Joyce from the various schemes of others and to protect him from his own impulse towards hucksterism. It is a credit to Pinker's reputation as a literary agent, in view of Joyce's frustration at not seeing his work quickly in print and in spite of the complexity of Joyce's maneuverings among many minor publishers, both continental and British, that he remained dedicated to his client's long-range interests, preferring to wait upon established houses and insisting on decent contracts between author and publisher. Pinker's letters in the Cornell Joyce Collection contain information involving Joyce's contracts with Grant Richards, B. W. Huebsch, and Harriet Weaver and the Egoist magazine. They help chart the migrations of Joyce's manuscripts, and document the sources and amounts of some of his meager income during the period, besides serving as a useful companion to those collections of letters dealing with Joyce's business difficulties already published ("Grant Richards to James Joyce," Studies in Bibliography , XVI; "Harriet Weaver's Letters to James Joyce," Studies in Bibliography , XX; and, of course, Stuart Gilbert's and Richard Ellmann's Letter of James Joyce ). These letters, fifty-one in all, are in good condition, typewritten on business stationery headed "James B. Pinker, Literary and Dramatic Agent, Talbot House, Arundel Street, Strand, London, W. C.," and all signed "J. B. Pinker," except letter Cornell Number 965 signed "James B. Pinker," Numbers 1012 and 1015 signed "Eric S. Pinker," and Number 1011 signed "Eric S. Pinker for JBP." Cornell Number 1014, and the enclosures with Cornell Numbers 985 and 998 are handwritten account sheets on ledger-lined paper headed "In Account with James B. Pinker, Talbot House, Arundel St. Strand. W. C." Any editorial corrections or emendations of these letters are described in the text, only headings, closings, and signatures being omitted here for compression. The brief notes which follow many of the letters are included in order to specify related letters, to identify some of the people mentioned, and to clarify some of the remarks whose significance may be lost in a one-sided record of correspondence.</field>

If the terms are fixed by your contract with him, then you would not, of course, require those books to come under our agreement, unless you wished me to look after the business.

I shall be glad to have the manuscript of the play 4 as soon as you care to send it to me, as I should like to read it, even though it be held over, as you suggest, until the publication of your novel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">967 20th April 1915, C/o Gioacchinmo [sic] Veneziani, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Sir, I have received your letter of the 5th. April enclosing the signed agreement for your dramatic work, and I now have pleasure in sending counterpart signed by myself. I also send a draft agreement for your literary work, 1 in accordance with your request, and I shall be very much obliged if you will sign this also and return it to me, when I will forward counterpart signed by myself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">968 27th April 1915, C/o Gioacchino Veneziani, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Sir, I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 16th., and it crosses a letter from me enclosing an amended agreement. In view of the fact that you wish me now to look after the future business with Grant Richards, the agreement will need some little modification, but that is only slight. I will see Mr. Richards and get his decision about the novel. Can you send me either the original or a copy of your agreement with Mr. Richards? I assume from what you say that he published "Dubliners", and I will make enquiries about the American edition. 1 Before doing so, however, I should like to see the actual agreement, in order to know where we stand. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">969 Encl. 7th May 1915, C/o Gioacchino Veneziano, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Sir, Thank you for your letter of April 30, just received, with its enclosures. I send, herewith, counterpart of the contract signed by myself. I have not yet received the copy of The Egoist for January 15th. last year, but if the editor does not send it I will try and get a copy. 1 I am glad to have the copy of your existing agreement with Mr. Grant Richards. What a terrible document that is! I have been pressing him to let me know his decision about the novel, but so far without any success. P.S. The copy of "The Egoist" has just arrived [ postscript handwritten ].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">970 11th May 1915, C/o Gioacchino Veneziani, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Sir, I have twice applied to Mr. Grant Richards for a decision regarding your novel, without success. He now telephones to say that although he does not doubt my word when I say I am acting on your behalf, he would like to have a confirmation of this from you. Perhaps you will be good enough to write to Mr. Grant Richards telling him that you have placed your affairs in my hands? 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">971 13th May 1915, C/o Gioacchino Veneziani, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Sir, I have just received your letter of the 7th., 1 and I am asking Grant Richards to let me have the MS. of your novel back, so that I can send The Egoist copy. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">972 27th May 1915, C/o Gioacchino Veneziani, Murano, Venice, Italy. Dear Mr. Joyce, I received your letter of the 9th. with its enclosure. 1 Mr. Grant Richards has declined your novel, and I am not sorry, especially in view of the result of his [his handwritten ] previous effort. I cannot understand about "The Dubliners" in America, and I suggest that if you have not written to the publisher mentioned by the editor of the Smart Set , 2 I should do, so and ask him if it be true that he is publishing "The Dubliners".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">973 5th July 1915, Gasthof Hoffnung, Reitergasse 16, Zurich, Switzerland . Dear Sir, I have your postcard of June 30th. 1 I am not sure whether you have received my letter telling you that Grant Richards declined your novel. 2 At any rate, he did decline it, and I am hoping that Martin Secker will take it up. I will, however, write to you again as soon as I have more definite news. The play you mentioned has not arrived, but perhaps it was not sent? 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">974 13th July 1915, Reinhardstrasse 7, Zurich, VIII., Switzerland Dear Mr. Joyce, Thank you very much for your letter of the 9th. 1 There is no reason why you should not send me the verse, as I might be able to dispose of some of it to magazines. I have not yet got a decision from Messrs. Secker about the novel. They are a little slow, but I have to be lenient with them at the moment. I hope they will take it up. Yes, I will see Mr. Ezra Pound about the play. Mr. H. G. Wells rang me up on the telephone the other day, asking for news of you. He had heard that you were in serious difficulty. 2 I told him that I had not heard of it, but that if there were anything he could do to help us I would certainly let him know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">975 18th August 1915, Reinhardstrasse 7, Zurich VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, You have already been advised, but as the posts are so uncertain I am repeating that the three acts of the play have arrived safely, and they have gone for consideration to the man 21 Mr. Ezra Pound mentioned. He is the representative of an American Syndicate, the Syndicate that is running "Peg of my Heart", so they must have money at any rate, even if they lack taste and judgment. Secker, I am sorry to say, declined the novel. I hoped he would have taken it up with enthusiasm, but he is feeling the depression like the rest of us and publishers are not easily to be kindled to enthusiasm at the moment. The difficulties do not depress me, but I realise how trying it must be to your patience, especially at the distance you are from the centre of things. I am now negotiating with Herbert Jenkins for the novel. He is very enterprising, and works a book well, but I would have preferred the other man. If Jenkins is no good, then I shall try elsewhere, and I need not assure you that I shall do my utmost. Grant Richards has not sent me the royalty accounts for "The Dubliners", but I am applying to him for them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">976 27th August 1915, Reinhardstrasse, Zurich, VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sorry to say the representative of the American Syndicate to whom I submitted your play has returned it, as she does not think it would be suitable for the American public for which they cater. She was quite enthusiastic about the play, said it was "beautifully written, and there were some poignant scenes in it," [ quotation marks handwritten ] but she feared it would only appeal to a small and very special public, and she therefore had to return it reluctantly. Is there any other manager you would specially like me to show the play to? I am holding it until I hear from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">977 7th September 1915, Reinhardstrasse, 7, Zurich, VIII, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received the royalty statement from Grant Richards. They printed 1250 copies of which 107 copies were given away free for review and so on, and they have on hand 644. The sales were, therefore, 499 copies. You will remember that according to the contract no royalty is to be paid until 500 copies have been sold, so that taking 499 at 13 as 12 there are some 50 more copies to be sold before royalty is payable. 1 I will get a copy of the New Age 2 and use it as you suggest. Mr. Pound has asked me to let him see the manuscript of your play so I have sent it on to him to-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">978 25th October 1915, Kreuzstrasse 19, III., Zurich, VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your postcard of the 20th. I have not yet received the royalty-account for "The Dubliners" from Grant Richards, but you will remember that he is not bound to render this until November 30th., although of course he can sent it before this date if he likes. I am sorry to say that Mr. Jenkins after all declined your novel, and I now have it under consideration with Messers. Duckworth. I trust you received my letter of September 7th., giving you the figures from Grant Richards up to last December?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">979 5th November 1915, Kreutzstrasse [sic] 19, III., Zurich VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your letter of October 31st. 1 I sent you yesterday Mr. Grant Richards' royalty account for "The Dubliners", and no doubt it has reached you by this time. I have "Exiles" in the office at the moment, and I can have a copy made and sent out to you if you wish, but the only way to do it would be to have it typewritten. If you would like this done, I will put it in hand and get it done as cheaply as possible. I note your suggestion about the novel; 2 but do you not think it would be better for us to see what comes of the negotiations with Messrs. Duckworth before trying Mons. Conard? Frankly, I doubt if the latter would take up the book on the terms you suggest. He tells me that he is doing quite well with his Continental Library, but he is finding production extremely difficult under present conditions, and his commitments of English novels in the Continental Library monopolise, I think, his energies at the moment. I tell you this not to crab your plan, but only because I think that it is not promising enough to justify us in abandoning the other. I am hopeful that Messrs. Duckworth will take up the work, but I have learned in these days not to be confident unless the thing is concluded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">980 17th November 1915, Kreuzstrasse 19, III., Zurich VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have this morning your various letters, including the one that enclosed a piece of verse. This I will deal with as promptly as possible, and let you know the result. 1 I will have a typewritten copy made of the play, and will send it to you, act by act, by registered post, as rapidly as possible. I note what you say about the novel, and will act accordingly. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">981 November 19th 1915, Kreuzstrasse, 19, III, Zurich, VIII, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sending you under separate cover by registered post the typewritten copy of Act I of "Exiles" and I shall be glad to hear that it has reached you safely. I will send the other two acts as soon as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">982 November 24th 1915, Kreutzstrasse [sic], 19, iii, Zurich, VIII, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sending you under separate cover by registered post the typewritten copy of Act II of "Exiles" and I shall be glad to hear that it has reached you safely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">983 November 25th 1915, Kreuzstrasse, 19, III, Zurich, VIII, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I am sending you, by this mail, registered, the third act of "Exiles" and I shall be glad to hear that it has reached you safely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">984 13th December 1915, Kranzstrasse [sic] 19, III., Zurich VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your postcard of the 6th. 1 Messrs. Duckworth have declined the novel, and I am showing it to Werner Laurie. I assume you would rather have it published here than under an arrangement such as your French friend may make? 2 I will hurry the decisions as much as possible, but all publishers and indeed most of the rest of us are short of staff now, and one has to be a little indulgent. Since writing the foregoing I have received your second card. 3 I will certainly see the editor of the Egoist , and I agree with you that it would be more satisfactory for them to publish the novel than to get it published in France. 4 I have written to Miss Weaver saying that I shall be very glad to see her and discuss the matter, and I will write to you again later.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">986 10th February 1916, Kreuzstrasse 19 III., Zurich, VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have received your two postcards of the 5th., 1 and in reply I write to say that the verses reached me quite safely, and I am doing my best with them. Mr. Wade, of the Stage Society, asked to see your play, and I sent it to him on the 26th.ult. He has however return [sic] it, and it is now with Miss Weaver. Your novel is also in Miss Weaver's hands, and she is arranging with her Directors for its publication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">987 Encl. 23rd March 1916, Kreuzstrasse 19, III., Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I received your letter, 1 and at once arranged the matter of the agreement with Miss Weaver, and sent the draft on to her for signature. I enclose the counterpart herewith. Miss Weaver tells me this morning that the agreement seems quite satisfactory, but she would rather not sign it until they have actually fixed up with some firm of printers. Up to the present they have not been able to get a firm of printers to set up the book, and she does not like to sign the contract until they know that they can carry it out. Miss Weaver may have written to you to explain her difficulty, but I am not sure of that. 2 I have applied to Grant Richards for the royalty accounts, but have not yet been able to get them from him. I will get them as soon as possible and will remit the amount to you. Your Poems are under consideration with the English Review , and Miss Weaver has your play. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">988 12th April 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (parterre, rechts) Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your letter of the 2nd., 1 and I write to let you know that I am getting into relations with the editor of Drama . They seem to have no London correspondent, so I am writing direct to them, and I hope to arrange that they will take the play. 2 The royalties on "The Dubliners" are not payable until the 31st. May, but I am trying to get from Grant Richards in the meantime a statement showing what they will amount to. I will write to Huebsch and try and arrange for him to do an edition of "The Dubliners" in the States.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">989 14th April 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (parterre, rechts) Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have your postcard of the 9th., and I have made a note of the arrangement in America for the Poems. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">990 1st June 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (Parterre, rechts), Zurich, VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, Many thanks for your letter of the 20th.ult. with the signed copy of the contract. I am sending a copy of "The Dubliners" to Mr. Marshall, 1 together with some of the press-notices, and I will try and arrange that he takes up this book. In the meantime I am suspending negotiations with Mr. Huebsch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">991 Express . 23rd June 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (parterre, rechtz) [sic] Zurich VIII., Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your postcard of the 19th., and I reply at once by express. The date for the publication of your novel is not yet fixed, and we cannot fix it until we hear from America. The American publisher is going to set up the book and The Egoist will, I believe, take sheets. 1 In America we shall get Ten Pounds on account of royalty, but on this side there is to be no advance paid on publication. Directly the date is settled I will advise you. Correspondence with America is slow now, as you can understand, but I will expedite matters so far as I possibly can. I have not yet heard from the Drama about the play, but I hope to get a decision from the Stage Society in a few days about the proposed production here. Grant Richards tells me he is very short-handed, and has not therefore been able to send me the royalty-account for "Dubliners". There is, he says, however, no royalty due to you, as the 500 copies free of royalties are not yet sold. As soon as I do get the account I will send it on to you. The verses are now with The Nation .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">992 Register . 16th October 1916, Seefeldstrasse, (par terre), Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your postcard of the 11th., and I will answer your questions in their order. A form of contract was sent to Mr. Huebsch for your novel, but he wanted some alterations in it, 1 so that I was obliged to send him another form. I am now daily expecting to receive the amended form back from him with his signature. The contract is between yourself and Mr. Huebsch, and as soon as I receive the signed form from him, I will send the agreement on to you for your approval and signature. The royalties are 10% on the first 2,000 copies sold, and then 15%. £10: is to be on account of royalties on signature of the contract. The date of publication is to be fixed by mutual agreement. 2 The text to be used is the copy you sent us from the Egoist . 3 Dubliners . Huebsch has not yet made an agreement for this book, but no doubt he will take it up eventually. The last account received from Grant Richards showed 536/495 copies sold, 4 and according to the agreement no royalty is due until after 500 copies have been sold. The next account is due next month. Exiles . This is still being considered by Drama , and I will let you know as soon as I have their decision. The Stage Society made no comment when returning the MS. Mr. Archer 6 has not read it, neither has it been submitted to Mr. Knoblock. 6 Verses . These are at the moment under consideration with Colour .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">993 30th October 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (par terre, rechts), Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your letter of the 24th., and I note that you wish your verses returned to you at the next opportunity. Exiles : You will remember that I have only one copy of this, and that went to Drama . I am afraid I have no suggestions to make regarding it, except that I do not think it stands any chance of production in present circumstances. Drama : I will certainly ascertain from this periodical if they have accepted your play. Dubliners : I sent Huebsch a copy of the press notices for insertion in the review copies of the novel some time ago. 1 Novel : I have no reason to think the negotiations are being held up owing to Huebsch requiring your signature before he signs himself. I have written to him asking him to let me have the agreement back signed, but without result, and I can only conclude that his business is carried on in a very dilatory fashion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">994 2nd November 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (par terre, rechts), Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just heard from the editor of Drama to say that he cannot after all accept "Exiles" for publication in his periodical. I am very sorry about this, as I quite hoped he would publish it. I am writing out to America, and am asking for the MS. to be returned to me as soon as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">995 November 28th 1916, Seefeldstrasse, 54, (par terre, rechts), Zurich, Switzerland.

I shall be glad to hear that it has reached you safely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">996 December 1st 1916, Seefeldstrasse, 54, (parterre rechts), Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received the MS. of your poems from the editor with whom they were under consideration and in accordance with your request, I am returning them to you, herewith. I shall be glad to hear that they have reached you safely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">997 20th December 1916, Seefeldstrasse 54, (par terre), Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have your letter of the 11th., acknowledging the receipt of the verses and the play. I will apply to Mr. Grant Richards for the accounts due on November 30th., but I expect there will be some delay about getting these, as every office is now so short-handed. Huebsch has not yet sent me the signed contract for your novel, nor have I received the advance of £10:. I have written to remind him of this, but he has not replied. Directly I do receive the money I will remit to you. I note that you wish to have a copy of the American edition, and I will give him the list of names, together with the slips, 1 to whom you wish presentation copies sent. I do not quite understand your reference to "Chamber Music". You are, I think, mistaken in thinking I have handled this MS. for you. This is the first time you have mentioned it to me.</field>

Owing to the war everyone is so short-handed over here that all royalty accounts are late in coming in. I will, however, let you know the moment I receive those for "The Dubliners".

I will tell the New York publisher what you say. I am very glad to hear that you are better, but I suppose you are not yet able to work. 1 You saw, I expect, the review by Wells in the Nation . 2 If you have not seen it I will send you a copy. I am getting various other people interested in the novel, and I hope we shall finally produce an effect this way. It is selling steadily/and [and interlin .] now that it has been published Grant Richards, as you may imagine, is fussing around reminding us of the terms of the contract. He is, however, as little mindful as ever of his own obligations, as I have only just been able to get the royalty statement for "The Dubliners" from him. I enclose this, herewith, and I am today sending you a money order for the amount due to you, and I shall be glad to hear that it has reached you safely.

      <field name="fulltext">1005 30th May 1917, Seefeldstrasse 73, III., Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have heard from Huebsch acknowledging the corrections for the novel and for "The Dubliners". He tells me that these corrections came too late for them to be of immediate use. A second printing of the novel was already on the press, and he had just finished an edition of "Dubliners" identical with the London edition. He is retaining the corrections for future use. 1 He will send you a copy of "Dubliners", but he has not yet issued your verses.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1007 15th August 1917, Seefeldstrasse, 73, III. Zurich, Switzerland. Dear Mr. Joyce, I have just received your postcard of the 8th. I am glad you have written to Mr. Richards, for he needs all the pressure we can bring to bear. I have not yet been able to get him to settle the details of the contract. I drafted a contract and sent it to him; but he does not like my draft, and said that he thought the contract should be simply a copy of the other. I do not think this a reasonable view, and it would not meet your wishes on various points, including the American side. He asked me to let him draft an alternative contract and submit it to me, I have been waiting for this and have not yet received it from him, in spite of repeated reminders. You know how difficult he is to pin down. If I call he is never there, and it is the same thing if one tries to get him on the telephone. One is therefore reduced to writing. I will find out when Mr. Grein 1 returns, and send him a copy of the play. I have relations with the Pioneer Players and with the Manchester Repertory Theatre, but the latter is closed now, as Miss Horniman 2 does not apparently find it possible to keep it going in War time. I will certainly take back [ handwritten above del. take] up your appeal to Mr. Richards about dates. I have heard from the editor of Poetry to say that they hope to use your poems in their September or October numbers. They would have liked to pay in advance she says, but at the moment Poetry is too poor to be able to do this. I have not yet received the royalty accounts from Huebsch.</field>

Dear Mr. Joyce, I am very sorry indeed to have this morning your letter of the 9th. with its bad account of your health. 1 I will tell the American publisher to make the corrections, and I am telling Mr. Grant Richards of them also. 2 There was no advance payable on publication either here or in America. Will you send the copy of "Ulysses" so that I can arrange on the lines you suggest. 3 I will send copies of "Exiles" to the Pioneer Players and Miss Horniman, in accordance with your instructions. I will send your message to the American publisher. He did not publish Mr. Lawrence's novel "The Rainbow", though he has not yet abandoned the idea. 4</field>

Dear Mr. Joyce, I sent out to Mr. Huebsch a contract for "Ulysses" drafted on the same lines as that for "A Portrait of the Artist" but I have received a letter from him this morning asking what provision is being made for submitting copy of the complete manuscript of the book to him before the agreement is signed. 1 He also complains that his rights are limited to the U.S.A. but I will explain to him that he cannot have Canada as that is included in the English contract. Perhaps you will let me hear from you on the question of sending Mr. Huebsch the manuscript of the book?

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I am grateful to Mr. George Healey and the Cornell University Library for permission to publish from the Cornell Joyce Collection, to Messrs. Hope Leresche and Steele for securing the permission of the Pinker family for this edition, and to the American Philosophical Society for support during the time the edition was prepared. 1 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ran almost continuously in the Egoist magazine from February 1914 to September 1915. 2 In his reply (17 March 1915) Joyce told Pinker that he should contact Ezra Pound who would act as his intermediary. Letters of James Joyce , ed. Stuart Gilbert (1957), p. 77. 1 Joyce's letter, Letters of James Joyce , II, ed. Richard Ellmann (1966), 338-9. 2 Joyce's contract of 20 March 1914 with Thomas Franklin Grant Richards, publisher of Dubliners , provided no royalties to Joyce for the first 500 copies and gave Richards first rights to publish all of Joyce's works for five years from the publication date of Dubliners (15 June 1914). The contract is in the Cornell collection, No. 1396. 3 In this agreement with Pinker (5 April 1915) Joyce makes him the agent for only his dramatic work. Cornell No. 1397. 4 Exiles . 1 In this contract Joyce agrees to let Pinker handle "all literary work," except that to be published under the previous contract with Grant Richards. The agreement with Pinker could be broken in twelve months following notice given by either party. Cornell No. 1398. 1 Joyce had been led to believe by a remark in a letter he had received from H. L. Mencken (3 March 1915) that an American edition of Dubliners had appeared. After further correspondence with Mencken and an exchange of letters with Ben W. Huebsch, he learned there was no such edition, although Huebsch later did bring out a first American edition of Dubliners (December 1916). 2 Joyce replied to Pinker (9 May 1915), advising him of Grant Richards' complaint that the serial publication of Portrait without his consent violated their Dubliners contract. For Richards' letter to Joyce, see Robert Scholes, "Grant Richards to James Joyce," Studies in Bibliography , XVI (1963), 156. Joyce pointed out to Pinker that the Egoist 's rights antedated the contract with Richards. See Gilbert, p. 80. 1 Joyce had written (30 April 1915) to Harriet Shaw Weaver, editor of the Egoist , asking her to send Pinker a copy of this issue, "as it may be useful for him to understand in what relations I stand and have stood till now with my publisher." Gilbert, p. 80. The issue contains an article, "A Curious History," in which Joyce's difficulties in publishing Dubliners are recounted. 1 Joyce did so. For Richards' acknowledgment, see Scholes, p. 158. 1 Joyce's letter, Ellmann, II, 341. 2 Harriet Weaver had sent Richards the latter part of the MS of Portrait along with copies of the Egoist containing the portions of the novel which had already come out, and she needed the text back in order to set up the remainder of the novel. Richards returned it directly to her instead of to Pinker. See John Firth, "Harriet Weaver's Letters to James Joyce, 1915-1920," Studies in Bibliography , XX (1967), 153-4. 1 Joyce's letter, Gilbert, p. 80. The enclosure was a copy of his sales account with Grant Richards, showing total sales of 499 copies of Dubliners . 2 Joyce had already been in contact with both Huebsch and Mencken. 1 The postcard announces Joyce's arrival at the Gasthof Hoffnung, Zurich, and asks for any news which might have missed him in Venice because of Italy's entry into the war. Ellmann, II, 349. 2 Richards' letter finally refusing Portrait (18 May 1915), Scholes. pp. 158-9. 3 Joyce had not yet sent Exiles . He mentions in a letter to W. B. Yeats (17 July 1915) that he is arranging to have a typescript made "in exchange for a certain number of lessons." Gilbert, p. 83. 1 Joyce's letter, Ellmann, II, 351-2. 2 Pound had begun his agitation to ease Joyce's financial difficulties by asking Wells and W. B. Yeats to recommend Joyce for a grant from the Royal Literary Fund. Pound's letter to Joyce on this matter (3 July 1915), Cornell No. 1024. 1 Cecil Dorrian. 1 Hence, not the hairsbreadth encounter with profit described in Richard Ellmann's, James Joyce (1959), p. 412, as, "one short of the number after which Joyce was to receive royalties." By the terms of his agreement with Richards, Joyce could be credited with only 461 books sold, leaving 39 to be sold before royalties. Nor is the term in the contract with Richards (part 17, "thirteen copies counting as twelve throughout") to be taken as another piece of villany on Richards' part. It is the same understanding Joyce entered into with Miss Weaver for the publication of Portrait (see Firth, pp. 167-168), and was the result of a convention of the bookseller's trade whereby the shops received thirteen copies for every dozen ordered, dozen lots being charged at a reduced price. 2 Joyce later explained to Pinker (13 September 1915) that an article (review of Dubliners ) was in the 25 February 1915 issue of New Age . Ellmann, Letters, II, 367. 1 See Gilbert, p. 84. 2 Joyce suggested withdrawing Portrait from Duckworth and sending it to Conard, offering him British and Continental rights on the terms that he publish it "as an ordinary French novel in yellow wrappers at 3 fr. 50c.," and not in the form of a Tauchnitz or Conard Standard edition. Gilbert, p. 84. 1 Joyce's letter (10 November 1915), Gilbert, p. 86. Joyce said he was sending two poems to be submitted to the Saturday Review "or any other paper which will print them and pay well and quickly." The Saturday Review (London) had previously accepted "Song" ( Chamber Music , XXIV ) and "Watching the Needleboats at San Sabba" ( Pomes Penyeach ) for the 14 May 1904 and 20 September 1913 issues, but took no further verses from Joyce. 1 Joyce was still pressing Pinker to "try some such scheme as I suggested" (i.e., the Conard scheme), adding that he had written about his idea to Arthur Symons and directing Pinker to send Symons the typescript of Portrait should he ask for it. 1 See Gilbert, p. 87. 2 Joyce asked about Duckworth's decision on Portrait , and told Pinker that Pound had stimulated the interests of Werner Laurie, John Lane, and "the niece of a French premier and a person of influence," Mlle. de Pratz. Pound's letter to Joyce (27 November 1915), Cornell No. 1031. 3 Also in Gilbert, p. 87, but above the previous communication. 4 Joyce told Pinker of Harriet Weaver's offer to publish Portrait , and approved of the offer. But he encouraged Pinker to continue to pursue other possibilities. "All these schemes can be worked simultaneously one against the other, can they not?" The French venture, here, refers to still another connection, this time through Mme. Muriel Ciolkowska, Paris correspondent for the Egoist , whom Miss Weaver had earlier suggested might be able to find a French publisher. Mme. Ciolkowska was unable to help. Her letter to Joyce (19 December 1915), Cornell No. 447. 1 Joyce's postcards (5 and 7 February 1916) ask Pinker to send Exiles to Allen Wade and to put Portrait in Miss Weaver's hands "so that it may be brought out as quickly as possible." Ellmann, Letters , II, 374. 1 Joyce's letter (10 March 1916), Ellmann, Letters , II, 374-5. 2 Pinker's contract stipulated that the novel be published in 1916, and since Miss Weaver was having trouble finding a printer she was afraid she would not be able to fulfill the terms of the agreement. "I should have no hesitation in signing it," she wrote to Joyce (25 March 1916), "if we had only you to deal with, but it is a different matter to be in Mr. Pinker's hands." Firth, p. 158. 3 Joyce's reply to this letter, Gilbert, p. 91. 1 See Ellmann, Letters , II, 376-7. 2 Drama then seemed a likely place to publish Exiles , for they had just printed an article on the play by Pound in February. 1 Probably with Huebsch who had shown interest in acquiring American rights to all of Joyce's work. See Huebsch's letter to Harriet Weaver (16 June 1916), Gilbert, p. 91. 1 The American publisher, John Marshall, at Pound's urging had agreed in May 1916 to publish Portrait , but was to back out of his promise in July, at which time Pinker was instructed to take up Huebsch's offer. 1 Because of the difficulty in finding a British printer for Portrait , Miss Weaver decided to take sets of printed sheets from Huebsch to be bound and sold as the first English edition. 1 Huebsch wished to add "the condition that I secure an option on the book which would normally succeed A Portrait . . . . Also that some arrangement be made by which I secure sheets of Dubliners ." Gilbert, p. 91. 2 Joyce very much wanted the novel out that year, and wrote to Huebsch (24 October 1916), "If, however, the book be delayed beyond the end of the year I should be much obliged if the date on the frontispiece be printed as 1916." Gilbert, p. 97. 3 Since Huebsch had been unable to secure John Marshall's corrected copy of the text, the text mentioned here was made up of cuttings from the Egoist with corrections added by Joyce. See Firth, pp. 161-2. 4 At the ratio of 13/12 again, Joyce is credited with sales of 495 copies when 536 were distributed. 5 William Archer, British playwright, to whom Joyce had written to ask help in placing Exiles . For Archer's letters in reply, see Cornell Nos. 397, 398. 6 Edward Knoblock, British playwright and novelist. Pound had suggested that Knoblock see the MS. of Exiles , and that he might possibly write a "stage version" of the play, noting that plays are not acted exactly as written and that Joyce might make use of the original version whenever it could be printed. Pound's letters to Joyce, Cornell Nos. 1341, 1342. 1 Slips were to be printed containing statements from reviews of Dubliners . See Joyce's letter to Harriet Weaver (16 December 1916), Gilbert, p. 96. 1 The slips printed from notices of Dubliners . 1 Harriet Monroe took several of Joyce's verses for Poetry 's May and November 1917 issues. 2 Although the serial publication of Ulysses did not begin in the Little Review until March 1918, Pound had already shown Margaret Anderson some of the early chapters. Huebsch also took the back cover of the March issue (III, No. 9) to introduce "James Joyce, an Irishman of distinction whose two books [ Dubliners and Portrait ] compel the attention of discriminating seekers after brains in books." 1 Joyce's severe attacks of glaucoma began this year. 2 "James Joyce," The Nation , XX, No. 21 (24 February 1917), 710-12, repeated in The New Republic (10 March 1917). 1 Alice Fredman, Secretary of the Stage Society, wrote to Pinker (23 March 1917), asking if they might read the play again. Later, at Joyce's direction, Pinker was to ask the Society to return the MS (10 July 1917). Joyce heard that despite Sturge Moore's support of Exiles , G. B. Shaw had stood against its adoption. See Ellmann, James Joyce , p. 429, and a letter from Miss Fredman to Sturge Moore (7 November 1917), Cornell No. 604. 1 See Ellmann, Letters , II, 394. 1 John Quinn, New York lawyer who later defended the Little Review's serial publication of Ulysses , was buying the MSS of Joyce's works. For Quinn's acknowledgement of receipt of one page of corrections for Dubliners and seven pages for Portrait , see his letter to Nora Joyce (16 June 1917), Cornell No. 1099. 1 Harriet Weaver had sent Huebsch corrections for use in the second American edition, but they arrived too late. Miss Weaver later asked that they be returned to her for a second English edition. See Firth, pp. 172-4. 1 For Joyce's heated reply (8 July 1917), see Ellmann, Letters , II, 398-400. 1 Jack Thomas Grein, Sunday Times drama critic. 2 Annie Elizabeth Horniman, backer for the Abbey Theatre and founder of the Manchester Repertory Theatre. 1 For Miss Weaver's dealings with these printers, see Firth, pp. 176-7. 1 Huebsch's first American edition of Exiles came out in May 1918. 1 Joyce's eyes were troubling him again. See Ellmann, James Joyce , pp. 454-55. 2 For the three changes Joyce requests in the text of Exiles , see his letter, Gilbert, p. 114. 3 Joyce proposed paperback editions of groups of episodes from Ulysses , the initial paperback to contain the first three chapters and to appear that autumn. 4 Joyce wanted Huebsch to send him a copy of The Rainbow and charge it to his account. British court action against this novel had caused much of the difficulty in finding English printers for Portrait and Ulysses . For Joyce's delayed reply to this letter (29 July 1918), See Gilbert, p. 115. 1 Mathews' second ed., January 1918. 1 The Skandinavisk Theater Bureau wished to handle Exiles but had trouble securing a text.

"Circe" was being finished, and Huebsch was to expect a duplicate text directly from Joyce. The remaining three episodes Joyce said he would send "in triplicate" to Huebsch, Margaret Anderson, and Harriet Weaver that autumn. E.L.A., p.22.

      <field name="heading_text">Speght's Chaucer Aand MS. GG.4.27 by George B. Pace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the primary reason for textual criticism is determining texts, there may be other reasons. One may simply want to set the record straight so that erroneous views need no longer be expressed. Or one may hope to discover the actual copy used for an early printed book. Or one may wish to answer a question of provenance or even of human biography. Something of all these "other" reasons underlies the present paper, which employs textual criticism not to establish a text but to throw light upon the books in which the text is contained. The books are: Cambridge University Library MS. Gg.4.27 (a Canterbury Tales manuscript; "of the highest importance" — Manly and Rickert) 1 and Thomas Speght's 1602 edition of Chaucer's works, the last, except for reprintings, of the Blackletter Chaucers. The point of impingement is Chaucer's poem An A B C , which occurs on the opening folios of the manuscript and appears for the first time in print in Speght's volume. When Speght published, in 1598, the first edition of his Chaucer, he obviously knew nothing of the A B C , since otherwise he would have printed it. So between 1598 and 1602 Speght came upon a manuscript having the poem. Can this manuscript be identified? I believe it can be: that it is Gg.4.27, which is now known to have been in the possession of Joseph Holland, antiquarian and lover of Chaucer, in 1600. 2 That Holland and Speght were acquainted is a virtual certainty. 3 What more likely place, then, for Speght to obtain the poem than Holland's manuscript where, as the poem begins the volume, it could hardly be missed? A close relationship between the Gg. 4. 27 and Speght texts has generally been recognized, but they have been looked upon, because of certain differences, as sister texts deriving from a lost common parent. 4 I believe I can show that the Speght text exhibits a sufficient number of the marked eccentricities of the version in Gg.4.27 to leave no doubt that Holland's volume is Speght's source. Assuming I am correct, we have a rarity — the actual copy underlying an Elizabethan printed book — 5 and I shall be interested in examining the changes Speght made, the amount and kind of editing to which he subjected his copy. Finally, I shall also wish to consider the significance of the derivation for the provenance of Gg.4.27 and for the question of the authenticity of Speght's well-known assertion that Chaucer wrote the A B C for Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster and wife to John of Gaunt. But first I must establish the derivation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I I shall make the following assumptions: I. That shared errors indicate close relationship; II. That unique readings are probably spurious; III. That the simplest derivation (tree) which will account for the variants is to be preferred. These are usual initial assumptions. 6 They are not laws; evidence may controvert them. The A B C survives in sixteen manuscripts. 7 The following readings occur only in Gg and Speght: 9. myn (for thin ) 11. omission of him 19. for to (for for ) 38. ben (for be ) 46. close in with þyn owene grace (for clothe with thi grace ) 49. Gracyouse (for Glorious ) 75. with þe (for to yow ) 83. peyne (for peynes ) 85. with (for of ) 87. omission of oure 89. of (for with ) 103. as litil (for litel ) 105. þo (for that ) 124. schal (for may ) 132. fulle (for rightful ) 133. ioye (for merci ) 158. on (for unto ) 179. out (for ought ) The number of shared variants is large; some are patently errors (e.g., lines 46 and 132). Therefore, according to Assumption I Gg and Speght are closely related. Chronology prevents the derivation of the fifteenth-century manuscript from the late Elizabethan printed book. Even so, it is useful to be able to show that the derivation of Gg from Speght is implausible on purely textual grounds (otherwise one might justifiably wonder if Speght were not simply a printed facsimile of some lost manuscript, a virtual duplicate like, say, the Chaucer Society transcriptions). Speght has the following unique readings: 53. nor (for not ) 56. sinke (for stynk ) 77. y e (for that ; Gg þ t ) 84. bostaunce (for bobaunce ) 90. then (for ther ) 92. can (for gan ) 121. right (for yit ) 136. that of pitie will (for that wole of pitee ) 137. he (for that he ) 144. royall (for rial ) 172. a (for as a ) 174. sured me (for mesured ) 175. or (for and ) 179. will (for wel ) Again the number of variants is large; some of the variants are patently spurious (e.g., lines 84 and 174); all of the variants are opposed in Gg by the generally supported readings. 8 Therefore, according to Assumption II Gg is not derived from Speght. Gg also has unique readings: 156. han (for have ); 173. besech (for preye ). Moreover, in line 90 Gg has a variant which, although not unique (it is in Gg's sister manuscript, Coventry; see fn. 7 above), is a patent error: þere brende (for brende ). All of these variants are opposed in Speght by the generally supported readings. Here the number of variants is indeed small, but this fact does not seem to have disturbed previous editors. According to Assumption II, then, Speght is not derived from Gg. Since Gg has been shown not to be derived from Speght, the (apparent) final conclusion is that the two derive from a lost common parent. This conclusion, however, ignores a large body of sublexical evidence which has never before been presented. "In spelling," Manly and Rickert remark (I, 177), "Gg [the entire volume] has long been recognized as unique among Chaucer MSS." The peculiarities of the Gg volume have been extensively studied by Caldwell, and both he and Manly conclude that the scribe was probably not English but a Dutchman or a Fleming. Among the forms they especially cite in evidence, quoting Canterbury Tales A 1527 and A 1579, is bosch for bush (MDu bosch ). 9 This form appears twice in the Gg copy of the A B C (lines 89 and 92): Moyses þ t saw þe bosch of flambis rede þow art þe bosch on wich þere gan dessendyn The corresponding lines in Speght are: Moyses that saw the bosh of flambis rede Thow art the bosh , on which there can descend All other manuscripts read bush or something closely resembling bush . It is hard not to believe that Speght got its strange bosh from Gg's bosch . Manly and Rickert (I, 177) comment upon another peculiarity of the Gg scribe: "He divides and joins words wrongly and makes nonsense"; they give myn che kys as an example. In line 174 Gg reads: Sithe he his merci me seured so large The corresponding line in Speght is: Sith he his mercy sured me so large The other manuscripts all read mesured . It is hard not to believe that Speght's unique variant resulted from a misinterpretation of the Gg reading with its unnatural space. A striking peculiarity of the Gg scribe is described by Manly and Rickert (I, 177) thus: "The n of possessive adjectives [is] regularly retained before consonants: myn self, myn lyf myn lust." This feature, foreign to Chaucer's English as well as to Speght's, 10 appears over and over in the Gg copy of the A B C and is often paralleled in Speght's; the Speght reading is given second: 7. myne perlious : mine perillous 16. myn schip : mine ship 18. myn synne, myn confusioun : mine sinne, mine confusioun 19. þyn presense : thin presence 23. myn dampnacioun : mine damnatioun 40. myn werk : mine werke 41. þyn tente : thine tent 48. myn deth : mine death 52. myn fadir : mine fader 55. myn socour : mine soccour 56. myn gost : mine ghost 68. þyn pete : thine pitie 74. þyn name : thine name 79. myn fo : mine fo 81. þyn sorwe : thine sorow 88. þyne petous eyne : thine pitous eyen 111. þyn goodnesse : thine goodnes 123. myn soule : mine soule 125. þyn sone , myn mene : thine sonne, mine meane 126. þyn self : thine selfe One could continue extending this listing (further examples may be found in lines 134, 143, 147, 159, 161, 167, 180). Such spellings occur in no other manuscript of the A B C . A few additional spellings could be cited but enough evidence seems to have been given. Assumption III asserts that the simplest derivation (tree) which will account for the variants is to be preferred. The bifid tree, with Gg and Speght deriving from a lost common parent, explains the lexical variants but leaves the strange spellings unaccounted for. The derivation of Speght directly from Gg accounts for the spellings (and for most of the lexical evidence) but leaves the variants in lines 90, 156, and 173 unexplained. Thus either of the possible trees leaves something unresolved. In this circumstance Assumption III applies. The simpler derivation is, of course, the second. Therefore the true conclusion is that Speght is derived from Gg. How are we then to explain the three lines where Gg is wrong and Speght right? I take the Speght readings to be conscious emendations. Speght was, after all, an editor, though an early one. Three emendations to the right reading in a poem of 184 lines is not beyond the bounds of a priori probability. Line 90 is rendered thus in Gg: Brennynge of which þere neuere a stikke þere brende . The repetition is so obviously in error that almost anyone would be inclined to strike the second þere out. The trivial variation in line 156, haue in Speght for Gg's han , is viewable as a mere modernization, han having become archaic by Speght's day. 11 The third variation, besech for preye in line 173, becomes much less striking when viewed in context: Ysaac was figeur of his deþ certeyn þat so fer forþ his fadyr wolde obeye þat hym ne rouȝt no þyng to be slayn Ryȝt so þyn sone list as a lomb to deye Now ladi ful of mercy I ȝow besech [173] Sithe he his merci me seured so large Be ye not skant for alle we synge &amp; seyȝe þat ȝe ben fro vengaunse ay oure targe Obviously, as the rhyme scheme of the poem is ababbcbc, line 173 should rhyme. Apparently preye is the only possible rhyme. 12 Anyone who tried to improve the defective rhyme scheme would produce the right reading. 13 To summarize: Between 1598 and 1602 Speght came upon a copy of the A B C . In 1600 Gg, with the poem on its opening folios, was in the possession of Joseph Holland. The manuscript was thus in London at the right time for Speght to use it, and in the hands of a man whom he almost certainly knew. Comparison of the Speght text with the text in Gg shows the two versions to be decidedly similar, the similarity including eighteen readings found in no other manuscript and more than thirty unusual spellings, likewise in no other manuscript, of a kind peculiarly characteristic of the Gg scribe and explainable in Speght's copy only on the assumption that it derives from Gg. Textual theory also requires this derivation. Surely one may write Q. E. D. Gg.4.27 was Speght's actual source.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Since we have no other instance in which the manuscript used for one of the Blackletter Chaucers has been identified, I shall examine in some detail Speght's handling of Gg, even when the results may seem predictable. I believe it may be of interest to have definite knowledge as to what one early editor of Chaucer did when he was faced with an actual manuscript. 14 The A B C has 184 lines or approximately 1400 words. Speght differs from Gg in 22 lines or 23 words. Not all of the differences are misreadings. As has been observed, Speght corrected Gg in five instances, the most notable being the besech-preye variant. These readings, successful emendations, must be subtracted if a meaningful assessment of Speght's accuracy is to be made. Moreover, the three readings in which both Gg and Speght are unique (fn. 13) must also be subtracted, the Speght variants being attempts, although unsuccessful, to correct a defective text. Finally, one of the Speght variants is regardable as simply a modernization ( royall for rial , line 144); it too should perhaps be subtracted. If nine of the differences, then, are disregarded, Speght averaged one error every 13 lines, or 14 errors out of 1400 words. How is this revised figure to be assessed? We have nothing exactly comparable, for none of the other manuscripts of the A B C appears to be a copy of an extant text. However, by collating Robinson's basic manuscript (Cambridge University Library Ff.5.30) with his reconstructed text one may arrive at some notion of a reasonable expectation. The manuscript exhibits ten differences. To be sure, this figure is imperfect. Even so, it bears out one's intuitive feeling, that Speght's copy is no better than what one might expect of a competent medieval scribe. The preceding paragraph deals with lexical differences only. The medieval scribe was notoriously unconcerned about spelling; Speght's attitude seems to have been similar (conceivably some of the spellings were due to the printer). The spelling of 630 words, or 45 per cent of the total, is preserved. These are mostly words like of , to , he , good , and name , where Gg and the usual Elizabethan spelling are in agreement. For the remaining words the spelling is sometimes modified only slightly (e.g., þe becomes the , occasionally ye ; ȝow , you ; Virgyne , Virgine ), but often the change is considerable: herte becomes heart ; reles , release ; myn , mine ; refeut , refute ; pete , pitie ; Bounte , Bountie ; faderis , faders ; iuge , iudge ; sorwe , sorow ; sauacioun , salvatioun , etc. The underlying principle may appear to be modernization but is more likely, perhaps, simply conformity with Speht's own usage; nor, of course, is the apparent modernization carried out consistently (e.g., modir now remains modir , now becomes moder ). The attitude resembles the medieval scribe's: fidelity to the spelling of the exemplar counts for little. Gg is without punctuation. Speght, like most modern editors, supplies punctuation. He uses only comma, period, and colon, and he often employs a comma where modern usage would prefer a semicolon. If we disregard these differences, Speght's punctuation is good and agrees with Robinson's in 121 out of 184 lines, or 65 per cent of the time. The figure is not an absolute indication; in some 32 lines more than one punctuation is possible (e.g., line 28, in Speght thus: For certis, Christis blisfull modir dere ; Robinson puts a comma after For also). Speght and Robinson punctuate one stanza identically (with the allowance mentioned). So much for general observations. A few of Speght's misreadings are interesting in themselves (and further proof, if such is needed, that Gg was Speght's exemplar). In line 56 Gg reads: To stynk eterne he wele myn gost exile ; Speght changes stynk to sinke , one guesses from a wish to ameliorate the diction (cf. the probable amelioration in St. John's College G.21: To lastande Paine ). In line 77 Speght reads y e where the correct reading is that ; one would suspect origin from þt — and þt is the Gg variant. In line 84 Gg reads bobaunce ("boast"); apparently Speght did not know the word and so, taking his cue from the context, coined the pseudo-archaism bostaunce . In line 144 Gg reads in so rial wise ; Speght removed this archaism, substituting royall for rial . In line 150 Speght reads sore for the correct yore ; one would suspect origin from ȝore , and such is the Gg reading. Speght's striking misreading of Gg's me seured as sured me has already been discussed. For one change, the title, Speght may have gone to another source. Today the first four folios of Gg are missing; the text of the A B C begins the fifth folio. The opening four folios may have been missing in Speght's day (Holland wrote his name on what is actually the fifth folio; one would assume that he would inscribe the first page of the manuscript). Someone, not the Gg scribe but probably Holland, wrote a title, in blue ink, at the top of the fifth folio: CHAUCERS A. B. C. 15 Otherwise the poem is untitled in the manuscript. Speght has the following title: Chaucers A. B. C., called La Priere de Nostre Dame: made, as some say, at the Request of Blanch, Duchesse of Lancaster, as a praier for her priuat use, being a woman in her religion very deuout . This is really two titles and a statement. The first title, Chaucers A. B. C. , appears in this form in Fairfax 16 as well as in Gg, but there is no need to suppose that Speght went beyond Gg for it. 16 The second title, La Priere de Nostre Dame , occurs only in Pepys 2006. If Speght consulted this manuscript, he did so purely for the title; no influence is to be seen in his text. The statement about Blanche appears nowhere else. It is possible that Speght obtained it from some lost source. It is also possible that he found all of his heading in Gg: the English title on folio 5, where it still is; the remainder on the missing fourth folio, which may have been merely so badly deteriorated in 1600 that Holland preferred to write his name on the next page. What, then, did Speght do with Gg? He copied the poem relatively faithfully, emending occasionally (not always rightly) and making an average of one real error every hundred words. He made the spelling largely conform with his own although he did retain such peculiarities as the n on possessive pronouns before consonants. He punctuated the poem. He provided an elaborate heading, possibly simply combining elements in Gg, possibly going elsewhere for part of it. Finally, a circumstance not remarked upon above, he featured his discovery on his title page, ending his list of the changes from the first edition with the statement, "Chaucers A. B. C. called La Priere de nostre Dame, at this Impression added." There are suggestions here of the modern editor, but even more of the medieval scribe. If it is in the latter tradition that Speght is to be viewed, he comes off fairly well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III That Speght made use of Gg has now, I feel, been conclusively demonstrated and is in consequence regardable as a fact in the manuscript's provenance. 17 The significance of the fact may be seen in the following quotation from Manly and Rickert (I, 178) concerning additions to Gg thought to have been done, or commissioned, by Holland: At the end of the MS are added 35 leaves containing transcriptions . . . supplying the text of the lost leaves . . . taken mainly from the 1598 edition . . . also a glossary, basically Speght's but expanded; and the portrait of Chaucer with the coats-of-arms, cut from the 1598 edition, and pasted in. 18 Thus a curiously reciprocal relationship obtains: Not only was Gg used to augment Speght; Speght was earlier used to supplement Gg!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV I shall conclude by returning to the possibility that Speght found all of his heading in Gg. This possibility is of great interest because of the statement that Chaucer wrote the poem for Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster, which constitutes, if true, an item in the poet's biography. Nothing, of course, is inherently improbable in Chaucer's having written the A B C for the wife of his long-time associate (and patron) John of Gaunt. Blanche died in 1369; the A B C is agreed to be an early poem. That Chaucer wrote the Book of the Duchess to lament Blanche's death is, although not a certainty, the common belief. Nevertheless Chaucerians have either given very qualified acceptance to Speght's statement or have rejected it — principally, it would seem, because of its late date. 19 If Speght's heading could be shown to have been in so venerable a manuscript as Gg the argument for authenticity would obviously be stronger. And not only because of the earlier date of Gg (1420-40). In the opinion of Manly and Rickert Gg was prepared for "a wealthy patron of literature . . . who knew owners of special texts" (I, 180). Presumably "special texts" may be interpreted to include special traditions. The fact that the statement about Blanche, and the accompanying French title, must be presumed to have been written at the end of folio 4 (rather than on folio 5 immediately above the text, as would now seem normal) presents only an apparent difficulty. Headings in manuscripts do occasionally appear just so. For example, the Leyden manuscript of Chaucer's Truth (Vossius Germ. Gall.Q.9) has the heading for the poem at the bottom of folio 95 b while the poem itself is on 96 a . The corresponding folio in Gg is missing. Are there compelling reasons for believing that it had on it the statement about Blanche? There are, at any rate, reasons. To begin with, the simplest explanation of Speght's heading is to assume that all of it was in Gg, and if a fact of biography were not involved this reason would doubtless seem sufficient in itself. Next, the French title is characteristic of Gg. Three of the four short poems which follow the A B C have foreign titles, and one of these is French ( Balade de bone conseyl [ Truth ]). Also, Speght's French title is found in Pepys 2006 (and only found there). Heath's tree (fn. 4 above) shows Gg and Pepys as deriving from a common source, now lost. Making the adjustment made necessary by this paper, showing Speght as derived from Gg, we have the following as the relevant portion of the tree: A strong textual reason thus exists for believing that Gg once had the French title at least. 20 Two other arguments apply strictly to the statement about Blanche. The phrasing — "made, as some say" — seems to point to an earlier day. The A B C must have been virtually unknown in the sixteenth century, as Speght was the first to print it. Finally, a special reason exists for believing that Gg, more than any other manuscript, might well have preserved a tradition about Blanche. Manly and Rickert's study of the early provenance of Gg leads them to conclude (I, 180) that the original owner was probably Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. As they observe, Humphrey was Chaucer's great-nephew (half blood). Even more pertinent to our discussion, Humphrey's grandmother was Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster. 21 This paper has shown that the version of Chaucer's A B C in the 1602 Speght, the first printed edition of the poem, is essentially a copy of an extant text. 22 The paper has also considered the editorial treatment which Speght gave to his source, and the relevance of the identification of the source for the provenance of the Canterbury Tales manuscript Gg.4.27 and for the authenticity of Speght's assertion that Chaucer wrote the A B C for Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster, which it rather strongly supports.</field>

Caldwell, "Joseph Holand, Collector and Antiquary," MP , XL (1943), 295-301, esp. 299. 3 They had mutual interests and at least two mutual friends: John Stowe and Francis Thynne (Stowe says he aided Speght with the 1598 edition; Thynne, after attacking certain features of the 1598 Chaucer, later assisted Speght). For these and other connections see Caldwell, ibid.; DNB , article on Speght; Joan Evans, A History of the Society of Antiquaries (1956), p. 12; Manly and Rickert, I, 182; John Stow[e], A Survey of London (1603), ed. C. L. Kingsford (1908), II, 111. 4 See the tree by Heath in A. W. Pollard et al., The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer (1908), p. xxxiv (Globe Edition). F. N. Robinson's arrangement ( The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , 2nd ed. (1957, p. 915) essentially agrees. 5 A rarity, at any rate, so far as the Blackletter Chaucers are concerned (W. W. Greg's articles on the early printed editions of the Canterbury Tales attempt only to identify the general type of manuscript). 6 They are, for example, the second, third, and fourth assumptions of my "Chaucerian Proverbs," SB , XVIII (1965), 41-48; see p. 44 and the reference there cited. 7 The thirteen authorities in Robinson's list (p. 915) plus three others, for which see A. I. Doyle and George B. Pace, "A New Chaucer Manuscript," forthcoming in the March 1968 PMLA (prints the recently discovered Coventry MS.—see below). Both Gg and Speght are available in the Chaucer Society's publications (Ser. 1, Nos. 57, 59); I have used my own transcriptions, which differ significantly once (see fn. 15 below). Since a comparison of my list of variants with the Chaucer Society's transcriptions will inevitably suggest that I have omitted readings, I feel I should observe that the readings are all in the unpublished Coventry MS., a true sister of Gg, and are thus properly excluded. 8 In two instances Speght is in error but is not unique: l. 150, sore (for yore ); l. 171, for to be (for to be ). Both readings are also in Harley 2251, presumably through accidental coincidence (there are no other resemblances). The readings in parentheses above, and also readings so handled in the text, represent majority usage and are taken for convenience from Robinson's edition of the poem. 9 Robert A. Caldwell, "The Scribe of the Chaucer MS, Cambridge University Library Gg.4.27," MLQ , V (1944), 37; Manly and Rickert, I, 178. 10 Which was similar to the modern practice; see OED , s. v. mine, thine . 11 In l. 3 Gg has han but is not unique (in l. 20 Gg omits the r in g [ r ] euous and line 112 in neue [ r ], but recovery of the full reading is virtually automatic). 12 Cf. Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1963), p. 1182 (Vocabulary of Rhymes). 13 For completeness I list the following instances in which Gg and Speght each read uniquely: l. 10, þu wit : thou will (for thou wolt ); l. 155, wiche : wish (for wisse ); l. 178, þe whiche : That wisht (for To wasshe ). Except for the title, see below, there are no other lexical variants. 14 Much of the time Speght, like some of his predecessors, simply took over an earlier printed text. 15 Not recorded by the Chaucer Society. The hand and ink are the same as those of the titles in Gg.4.27.1(b) which are believed by Caldwell to be by Holland. 16 The Fairfax title is added in the margin in a later hand (cf. Robinson's note, p. 855, which misleads) said to be Stowe's (in the manuscript, but in pencil in a 19th century hand; there is not much to go on). I think it probable that a connection exists between these added titles. 17 One of a limited number of actual facts; see Manly and Rickert, I, 179-182, and Caldwell's articles. 18 Now bound separately as Gg.4.27.1 (b). 19 Furnivall "suppos'd" the heading to be by John Stowe, "in imitation of Shirley" ( Supplementary Parallel-Text Edition of Chaucer's Minor Poems , Chaucer Society, Ser. 1, No. 59, p. 28; cf. fn. 3 above). Skeat regarded it as possibly true but "probably a mere guess" ( The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , 1894, I, 59); Brusendorff viewed it as a fabrication either by Speght or Stowe ("anyhow . . . too late to be accepted, since there exists no corroborative evidence whatever"; The Chaucer Tradition , 1925, p. 241). Marchette Chute, in her attractive biography, sees nothing "inherently improbable" ( Geoffrey Chaucer of England , 1946, p. 89). Robinson comments (p. 855): "no confirmation has been found." 20 Pepys (two copies, fragments of 60 lines each) is so placed partly because of the title but also because of general similarity, especially in lines 53 and 59. The unpublished Coventry MS. (fn. 7 above) has a (wholly) unique title; I believe it to be a sister of Gg, but even so a clear line for the transmission of the French title can still be drawn. 21 Working within Manly and Rickert's probabilities, one may discern other paths by which a tradition might have traveled, especially in the connection seen with Lewis de Robessart, the "familiar" of another grandson of Blanche's (Henry V) and "somehow related to the Chaucers" (I, 181). Then, of course, Humphrey was the patron of Chaucer's follower, John Lydgate. 22 And therefore cannot tell us anything about the text of the poem (not the heading) that Gg cannot tell better; Speght should no longer be cited in support of a reading in the text of the poem (cf. Robinson, p. 915, on. l. 181).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Benson's Alleged Piracy of Shake-Speares Sonnets and of Some of Jonson's Works by Josephine Waters Bennett</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When, in 1916, R. M. Alden demonstrated 1 that the edition of Shakespeare's sonnets published by John Benson in 1640 was set entirely from the Quarto published by Thomas Thorpe in 1609, scholars and critics immediately jumped to the conclusion that Benson's motive for the many changes he made in the arrangement of the sonnets was to conceal a piracy. Alden himself says that "As to the remarks in Benson's Preface, they must be regarded as deliberately intended to deceive; the book was made by reprinting the contents of three or four volumes [actually two] issued some thirty years before, but purchasers were to be led to think that the material in it was new." 2 Hyder E. Rollins, in his edition of The Sonnets published in 1944, says, "Thorpe, who owned the copyright of Q, ceased to publish in 1624. Fifteen years later John Benson pirated Thorpe's text, but took such great pains to conceal his piracy that he has deceived many modern scholars, just as apparently he hoodwinked the wardens of the Stationers' Company" (II, 18). Later he adds, "Nobody who studies the Poems [i.e. Benson's text] without preconceived opinions can fail to see that it was an illegal publication. The omission of the word sonnets and of the puzzling dedication to Mr. W. H., as well as the rearrangement of the sonnets and the P [ assionate ] P [ ilgrime ] poems, was a deliberate, and evidently successful, attempt to deceive readers and to hide the theft." 3 Most recently John Dover Wilson calls Benson's edition "a piratical treatment of the Sonnets ," and calls the volume, rather unjustly, "a heterogeneous collection of poems by other poets including Milton, Ben Jonson, Herrick, and anyone else from whom the editor thought he could pilfer without infringing copyright." 4 There is cause for any amount of indignation at what Benson did to Shakespeare's sonnets, but an examination of the situation shows that the charge of piracy is entirely unwarranted, and this mistake obscures his real motives and what they show us of the reputation of the sonnets in his day. It also has an unfortunate effect on the evaluation of his text of some of Ben Jonson's works, as we shall see. Benson called his publication, Poems; Written by Wil. Shake-speare. Gent . Printed at London by Tho. Cotes , and are to be sold by Iohn Benson dwelling in S t . Dunstans Church-yard. 1640. The contents of this volume have been thoroughly analysed, 5 and all we need before us is a summary. After preliminaries, including the title page, a portrait, a letter "To the Reader" signed I. B. (John Benson), and two verse tributes to Shakespeare, comes the body of the work which consists of all the contents of the 1609 Quarto, except the dedication and eight sonnets which Benson, or his printer, may have missed in the confusion of the rearrangement. 6 The sonnets have not only been rearranged, and grouped into "poems" made up of from one to six sonnets, each poem with a title, but interlarded among these "poems" is the entire contents of the third edition of The Passionate Pilgrime , a miscellany containing twenty-nine poems, five of which are Shakespeare's, and the last nine are by ThomasHeywood. 7 Benson's medley of lightly disguised sonnets and other lyrics is followed by six more lyrics from miscellaneous sources, three of which were Shakespeare's and there was some warrant in The Passionate Pilgrime for giving the other three to him. The next three pieces are: "An Epitaph" signed I. M. for John Milton, "On the death of William Shakespeare," signed W. B. for William Basse, and an anonymous "Elegie." This is followed by the word Finis on sig. L1 verso, and on L2 occurs a new heading, "An Addition of some Excellent Poems, to those precedent, of Renowned Shakespeare , by other Gentlemen." There follow fifteen poems which Benson took the precaution to copyright. Under the date 4 November, 1639, in the Stationers' Register , is the entry, "John Benson. Entred for his Copie under the hands of doctor Wykes and Master ffetherston warden An Addicion of some excellent Poems to Shakespeares Poems by other gentlemen viz t . His mistris drawne, and her mind by Beniamin: Johnson. An Epistle to Beniamin Johnson by ffrancis Beaumont. His Mistris shade . by R; Herrick. &amp;c." 8 The usual sixpence was paid for this entry, and no more would have been paid if he had entered "Shakespeares Poems with an Addicion, etc." The entry does record that he is printing Shakespeare's Poems . There was nothing surreptitious about that. The only problem, therefore, is why he copyrighted (or safeguarded his exclusive right to print) the "Addicion" but not Shakespeare's Poems , which he featured in his title. Of the two books used to make up this title, The Passionate Pilgrime had never been entered in the Stationers' Register and therefore the right to reprint it belonged legally to the Company of Stationers. William Jaggard had printed three editions, one and probably two in 1599, and what he labeled "The Third Edition" in 1612. His printing business, including his copyrights were inherited by his son Isaac, and on June 4, 1627, Isaac's widow consented to the assignment of his copyrights to Thomas and Richard Cotes. 9 Thomas Cotes was the printer of Benson's edition of Shakespeare's Poems . He had no valid claim to copyright in The Passionate Pilgrime , since the Jaggards had none, but he may have claimed some interest in it, — may even have supplied the copy for that part of Benson's volume in return for the printing contract, the only certainly profitable part of this publishing venture. 10 There is some reason to think that he supplied part of the preliminary and concluding matter; but before discussing that we must deal with Thorpe's copyright to the Sonnets which is the crux of our problem. Thomas Thorpe, the first publisher of Shake-speares Sonnets (1609), has also been described as "the pirate of Shakespeare's sonnets," 11 but however he came by his manuscript, he entered it in the Stationers' Register on May 20, 1609 (Arber, III, 410), just thirty years before Benson reprinted the Sonnets in his Poems . Meanwhile, Thorpe had neither reprinted nor recorded a transfer of the copyright. It is probable that he was dead by 1640, but in any case his publishing rights had lapsed to the Company. 12 He was fifteen when he was apprenticed in 1584, so that he would have been seventy in 1639. 13 But his last recorded publication was a second edition of Chapman's Tragedy of Byron in 1625, so that by 1640 he was no longer an active member of the Stationers' Company, and only active members could hold copyright. 14 There is record of a Thomas Thorpe admitted to an almsroom in the hospital for indigents at Ewelme in Oxfordshire on December 3, 1635. 15 This hospital was part of the royal estates, 16 and it seemed questionable whether this could be Thomas Thorpe stationer, since the Stationers had substantial funds for the care of their own members. 17 However, a recent book, Albert J. Loomie's The Spanish Elizabethans , provides the key to this puzzle. In his investigations of the affairs of Sir Francis Englefield, he reports that, in an inquisition post mortem taken in London May 27, 1597, Thomas Thorpe "stationer" testified that five months before, he had been in Spain where "by the meanes of Father Parsons he did ly in the said Sir Francis Englefield's house in Madrid" three weeks after the death of Englefield. 18 This entry throws a flood of new light on Thomas Thorpe. As a member of the Stationers' Company he had published nothing between February 4, 1594, when he was admitted freeman of the Company, and 1600 when he arranged for the publication of Lucans First Booke translated line by line, by Chr. Marlow . He dedicated this volume "To His Kind and True Friend: Edward Blunt," and there is reason to believe that Blount had a continuing interest in the publication. 19 The testimony of the inquisition post mortem strongly suggests that Thorpe was a Catholic and that he was in the employ of the English government. That would explain why, in his old age, he found asylum in the royal almshouse at Ewelme. It also suggests why he was Ben Jonson's publisher during the period when Jonson professed Catholicism. "By the meanes of Father Parsons," undoubtedly Robert Parsons, the famous Jesuit, opens a wide new avenue of research and suggests that there is still much to learn about the first publisher of Shakespeare's sonnets. However, the concern of this paper is with the second edition. It is evident that both parts of the body of Benson's volume belonged to the Stationers, The Passionate Pilgrime because it had never been "entered," and Shake-speares Sonnets because the copyright had been allowed to lapse. Therefore, if the publication cheated anyone, it must have been the Company. Did Benson, as Rollins says, "hoodwink the wardens of the Stationers' Company?" If so he ran a very heavy risk, for in 1637 the Stationers were subjected to the second "Decree of Starre-Chamber, Concerning Printing," which made it mandatory that every book be not only licensed but also "entered" "upon paine that every Printer offending therein, shall be for euer hereafter disabled to use or exercise the Art or Mysterie of Printing, and receive such further punishment, as by this Court or the high Commission Court . . . shall be thought fitting" (Arber IV, 528-36; Greg, First Folio , p. 31). No wonder Benson was so careful to enter his "Addicion." Punishment for illegal printing fell as heavily on the printer as on the publisher, 20 and Benson's volume was printed by Thomas Cotes, printer of the second Folio (1632) of Shakespeare's plays, and part owner of copyrights to many of them. In 1639 he not only had a financial interest in Shakespeare, but he was one of the most substantial printers of the day. His name occurs in the list of twenty-three named by the Stationers at the request of the Court of Star Chamber as worthy to be an authorized printer, and he was so authorized in the decree of 1637 (Arber, IV, 528, and 532, art. XV of the Decree). The fact that Cotes did the printing makes it highly improbable that there was anything surreptitious about the 1640 Poems . Several other members of the Company had financial interest in Shakespeare. In 1609 Thorpe divided his copies between two booksellers, William Aspley and John Wright, and both of these men were active in the Company in 1639 when Benson entered his "Addition" with its mention that it was an addition to Shakespeare's poems. Aspley seems to have been a friend of Thorpe's since the Stationers' Register records several business arrangements between the two. He held the copyright to two of the plays, 21 and he was a member of the Court of Assistants, the inner circle which transacted the business of the Company, from 1630 to 1640 when he was elected Master. 22 He had served as one of the two Wardens, 1632-1635. The Wardens were responsible for entries and transfers of copyrights (see Greg in Greg and Boswell, pp. lxix-lxxvii). It seems more likely that he supplied Benson with a copy of the Quarto than that he did not know what of Shakespeare's Benson was printing. John Wright was a beginner when he took half of the Sonnets for sale in 1609, 23 but in 1626 he acquired part title of Venus and Adonis with John Haviland (Arber, IV, 160). He printed the fifteenth edition of this poem in 1636 for Haviland (Rollins, Poems , p. 378), and the two reentered the poem in 1638 (Arber, IV, 431). Both Wright and Haviland would surely be interested in knowing just what poems of Shakespeare's Benson was publishing. So would John Harrison who published the eighth quarto of Lucrece in 1632 (STC No. 22352). John Smethwick, who was master of the Company in 1639 when Benson made his entry, owned copyright to four of Shakespeare's plays, including Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet . 24 Cotes certainly knew that his press was setting type from printed copy. Aspley, Wright, Haviland, Harrison, and Smethwick would all be interested to know what poems of Shakespeare's Benson was publishing. No doubt they did know. Books the copyright of which had come into the possession of the Stationers' Company were sometimes licensed for reprinting, a fee being charged for the benefit of the poor of the Company. In 1636 both Benson and Cotes experimented with the publication of such books. On August 1, "John Benson Came this day vnto y e Co rt . and Craved leaue to Imprint one Impression (here the words "one impression of Latimers sermons" have been deleted) he giueing such Consideration vpon the finishing of the said Impression as this Co rt should thinke fitt or usuall in this kind, w ch , the Co rt taking into Consideration hath ordered that he shall [ have ] Liberty to Imprint 1500. of the said bookes paying therefore vpon the finishing of the Impression such fyne as this Co rt . shall thinke fitt." The marginal notation reads, "M r Benson to print 1500. of the Golden Meane. giuing Consideration to y e vse of the Poore" (Jackson, p. 285). The change from Latimer's Sermons to The Golden Meane was necessary because Thomas Cotes had already been granted the privilege of printing one impression of Latimer's Sermons . At the next meeting of the Court, September 28, Cotes was "warned to the table" and paid £3/6/6 for the privilege of reprinting these sermons, as he had been given permission to do on February 3, 1633 (Jackson, pp. 285, 254). His edition is dated 1635. 25 Benson's edition of The Golden Meane has a colophon dated Maii 3, 1638. Again, on July 27, 1639, "M r Benson desired leaue of the Co rt . to print an Impr'ssion of the play called The Tragedy of Albouine made by M r Davenant w ch was printed in Anno 1629. &amp; neuer entered &amp; therefore in the disposal of this Co rt . Vpon Consideracion thereof It was ordered that the said M r Benson should haue leave to print an Imp r ssion of 1500. paying to the poore of this Company xls." 26 Benson did not print this work, probably because the original impression was still not sold out, but three months later he "entered" the "Addition" to Shakespeare's poems. Quite possibly the Poems were substituted for Albovine as two years earlier The Golden Meane had been substituted for Latimer's Sermons . At any rate it is reasonable to assume that proper arrangements had been made, because in 1639 and 1640 Benson was especially dependent on his Company for support and protection, and therefore particularly likely to keep his transactions with them in good order. He was engaged in a struggle with Thomas Walkley over the publication of Jonson's unpublished works. When Ben Jonson died in 1637 he left a substantial number of pieces unpublished. He apparently made Sir Kenelm Digby his literary executor, and it is commonly said that Digby edited them, although what Digby said was that he would publish them, 27 and what he did was to sell the papers to the publisher, Thomas Walkley for £40, so Walkley testified. 28 Walkley had them printed without entering them in the Stationers' Register . Meanwhile Benson secured copies of some of the pieces and promptly entered them. His first publication of any of Jonson's works appears in the "Addition" to Shakespeare's Poems entered November 3, 1639. Six weeks later, on December 16, he entered Jonson's "Execration against Vulcan" and "smaller Epigrams" (Arber IV, 493). Two months later, February 8, 1640, he entered Jonson's translation of Horace's Art of Poetry (Arber, IV, 498). Finally, on February 20, 1640, he entered Jonson's Masque of the Gypsies . 29 All of these pieces appeared in 1640 printed by J. Okes for John Benson. 30 Meanwhile, on January 20, 1640, a Bill of Complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery by Thomas Walkley complaining that Jonson had given his unpublished works to Sir Kenelm Digby "to dispose thereof at his will and pleasure," and Digby had sold them to Walkley who, "having procured license for the printing thereof and having to his great charge caused them to be printed," before they were "fully perfected, one John Benson &amp; Andrew Crooke" 31 having obtained "by some casuall or other indirect meanes false and imperfect Copies of the said workes did make an Entry in the Hall of the Company of Stationers . . . ." Walkley, according to his own account of the affair, complained to one of his Majesties Secretaries of State who granted a warrant "prohibiting the sayd Benson &amp; Crooke from further printing or publishing the same workes or any of them" ( Ben Jonson , IX, 98-99). He was using the royal authority to defeat the Stationers' right to grant copyright, and they found a way to deal with him; for the complaint goes on to report, "But nowe . . . one John Parker a stationer also of London p r tending the said Benson to be greatly indebted to him and finding the name of the said Benson to be entred in the hall of the stationers for the printing &amp; publishing of the said workes and knowing that diverse of the said bookes w ch yo r Orato r [Walkley] had at his owne proper charge caused to be printed were accordingly printed and ready for to be published, And knowing also where they were, the said Parker did by some private practice or agreem t w th them the said Benson &amp; Crooke cause the said bookes w ch yo r Orato r had soe caused to be printed to be attachd in London as the wares of him the said Benson at the suite of him the said Parker for a p r tended debt supposed to be owing to him the said Parker by the said Benson and proceeding thereupon in the Guildhall London obtayned a Judgem t therevpon, yo r Orato r being noe way privy thereunto or knowing thereof." This was no bit of private chicanery, but the might of the City guilds against the royal authority on the eve of the Civil War. John Parker was a member of the Court of Assistants of the Stationers' Company, and in July, 1641, he was elected Underwarden. In accordance with custom, he served as Warden twice (1644 and 1645), and then was elected Master in 1647 and again in 1648. 32 As early as 1628/29 Parker and William Aspley had refused to pay their part in a levy of "a great some of money for his Ma ties " use, and they were suspended from their interest in the English stock and Parker was further deprived of his "livery." He did not make his peace until January, 1630. 33 His services as Warden and Master during the early years of the Commonwealth indicate where his sympathies lay. Walkley, on the other hand, was a Royalist with a long record of toadying to titles, failing to register his publications, and even pirating. 34 He continued to publish for the Cavalier poets, entering (prudently) works of Thomas Carew in March and June, 1640 (Arber, IV, 504, 514). He also printed two royal proclamations in 1641, and he persisted in his support of the King even after Charles I was executed, for on December 1, 1649, a warrant was issued for his arrest for dispersing scandalous declarations sent from the King's sons in Jersey ( Calendar of State Papers , Domestic Series , 1649-50 [1875], p. 557). Benson's two publications of Jonson's miscellaneous works went on sale in 1640, while Walkley's printing was delayed until 1641, and then it was appended, without separate title page or Walkley's name, to the remaining stock of the second volume of Jonson's Works . 35 The first volume was simply a reprint of the Works of 1616 printed by "Richard Bishop and are to be sold by Andrew Crooke," and the copyright was in order. But the second volume bore on its title page simply "London, Printed for Richard Meighen, 1640." This leaf is followed immediately by the title page of the 1631 edition of Bartholomew fayre with the imprint, "I.B. for Robert Allot. 1631." In fact, the first 170 pages are the text of the three plays so badly printed in 1631 that the edition was never finished. The sheets had evidently passed from Allot to Crooke who acquired the business after Allot's death. This 170 pages is followed by what appears to be what Walkley had printed, beginning with page 1 (sig. Aa), and three more plays, each with a full page title, but the imprint is simply "Printed M.DC.XL" without the names of printer and publisher as required by law. Apparently Meighen, an experienced and reputable member of the Stationers Company, and one of the syndicate which published the second Folio of Shakespeare, bought Crooke's part of the old printed sheets (after Crooke had been stopped from further publication by the royal prohibition described by Walkley) and Walkley's sheets (impounded by the authority of the Guildhall), bound the two parts together, added only a general title page and sold this as the second volume. Possibly Digby had helped in some way, since Walkley evidently told Humphrey Moseley when he sold his rights to him in 1658 that Digby was the publisher (See above, note 27). Jonson's latest editors assume that Walkley published in 1641, but, while he evidently sold his printed sheets to Meighen, he was still trying to get a license to publish the "peece of Poetry of M r Ben: Johnsons which cost him 40 li " from the licensers of the commonwealth in 1648, since the "authority" (royal) which he had in 1640 was "excluded, and become invalid" ( Ben Jonson , IX, 100). Not until September 17, 1658, did he gain entry for his publication in the Stationers' Register , and then a Salvo iure cuiuscunque was added to the entry. 36 Benson must also have been compensated by Meighen, since his several small pieces were included in Walkley's text, printed from a different manuscript ( Jonson , IX, 123-28). Because Benson's reputation had been blackened by the charge that he "pirated" Shakespeare's sonnets, the editors of Jonson's Works accepted Walkley's testimony without investigation, giving an account of the affair very hostile to Benson, although they recognize that Benson went to considerable trouble and expense to produce a good text, of The Gypsies Metamorphosed especially, while Walkley's text of that masque "is execrable" ( Jonson , VII, 541, 542-546, 551-555, 562, and IX, 134-35). However, if Benson's publication of Shakespeare's sonnets was in no way illegal, surreptitious, or "pirated," we are left with the question, why did he omit Thorpe's dedication to "Mr. W. H.," and rearrange both the Sonnets and the poems from The Passionate Pilgrime , omitting the word sonnets from his title? Although Rollins raises this question, he supplied most of the answer in another connection. He says "it was the usual thing, when an author did not supervise the printing of his book, for Elizabethan and Jacobean publishers to edit, title, and arrange poems as they saw fit" ( Sonnets , II, 75). The sixth edition of Lucrece (1616) was provided with a table of "The Contents" and some marginal guides to several passages; and the ninth edition (1655) inserts these headings into the text, like chapter headings, omits Shakespeare's dedication, and adds one by J. Quarles who dedicates the volume to Mr. Nehemiah Massey (Rollins, Poems , pp. 409-412). The first edition of England's Helicon (1600) was dedicated to John Bodenham, but the copyright changed hands in 1613 and the new owner dedicated the second edition to Lady Elizabeth Cary (Rollins ed., Cambridge, Mass., 1935, II, 70; and see II, 63 ff. on the liberties taken with the texts to make all poems pastorals). The change of title, from Sonnets to Poems may have been due to the fact that the 1640 volume contained not only the sonnets, but "A Lovers Complaint," a narrative poem of 329 lines, and 9 poems from The Passionate Pilgrime , including some translations from Ovid, which were certainly not sonnets, and hardly lyrics of any kind. Although sonnets were not so popular in 1640 as they had been in the 1590s, Benson made no effort to conceal the fact that most of these poems were sonnets. Of the 72 poems into which he grouped 146 sonnets, many were single quatorzains. What he did by his rearrangement and titles was to destroy any resemblance to a long narrative poem of 14-line stanzas, creating, instead of Thorpe's numbered order, a volume of lyrics of varied length; and, by intermingling 29 poems from The Passionate Pilgrime , of varied meters. In spite of the omission, probably inadvertent, of eight sonnets, the 1640 Poems represents a gathering up of scattered and long out-of-print poems by and about Shakespeare, such as an admirer might collect. There has been some effort to secure a complete text, but the compiler used everything (including many lyrics by other poets) which he found attributed to Shakespeare in print. He printed as Shakespeare's the whole of Marlowe's "Come live with me and be my love," Raleigh's "Reply" and "Another of the Same Nature," because he found in The Passionate Pilgrime a poem (no. XIX of Rollins' facsimile reprint) made up of four of Marlowe's six quatrains and one of Raleigh's "Reply." He took his text from England's Helicon (1600) where the three poems appear together (Rollins, Sonnets , II, 21; Poems , p. 605). Obviously his copy of The Passionate Pilgrime , like most of the surviving copies, had "by W. Shakespeare" printed on the title page. He also added two songs from the plays. The first, "Take, O take those lippes away," has only one stanza in Measure for Measure but he secured a version which gave two. 37 The second is from As You Like It . 38 Between these two he put "The Phoenix and the Turtle," a lyric attributed to Shakespeare in the collection of "Poeticall Essaies," appended to Loves Martyr: or, Rosalins Complaint by Robert Chester, a long obscure poem published in 1601. Ten years later Matthew Lownes, who had acquired the unsold sheets, gave the work a new title, The Anuals [sic] of Great Brittaine , in an effort to sell the remainder. 39 The four preliminaries and three closing pieces also indicate a desire to honor and commemorate Shakespeare, and here Thomas Cotes' assistance is apparent. There is a frontispiece portrait imitated from the Droeshout portrait in the Folio, by William Marshall, 40 who also did a portrait of Jonson for Benson's duodecimo of that worthy. Under the portrait Marshall has engraved eight lines, the first six of which are borrowed from Jonson's tribute to Shakespeare in the Folio. 41 Next comes Benson's "To the Reader" in which he says (albeit with more elegance than clarity) that he is publishing some little-known poems published by Shakespeare in his lifetime, and "you shall finde them Seren , cleere and eligantly plaine," the ideal for lyrics in Benson's day, not such "cloudy stuffe as puzzell intellect"! He says also that he has been "some what solicitus to bring them forth" perfect, and no doubt he tried (Reprinted in Rollins Poems , p. 607; Sonnets II , 23). Following the "To the Reader" is a three-page poem "Upon Master William Shakespeare, the Deceased Author, and his Poems," by Leonard Digges, the step-son of William Russell, the overseer of Shakespeare's will. Digges had a twenty-line poem in the same meter in the First Folio, and this longer poem was written for a Folio of the plays since it is entirely concerned with them. In fact, it is a reply to Jonson's tribute published there. Jonson contended that "a good poet's made as well as born." Digges begins, "Poets are borne not made." And where Jonson celebrates Shakespeare's superiority to the ancients, Digges denies that he owes them anything, making pointed references to Jonson's borrowings. Where Jonson compares Shakespeare to Lyly, Marlowe, and Kyd, Digges compares him to Jonson, taunting Jonson with the lack of popularity of his plays and the great drawing power of Shakespeare's. 42 Digges had been dead for five years in 1640, and Jonson had been dead for three. Whether this spirited poem was written for the first, or for the second Folio it was probably among the papers in Cotes' printing house. The second poem among the preliminaries was written by John Warren for Benson's volume. It mentions Jonsonus Virbius , a volume of tributes to Jonson (1638), in a way which suggests that Warren thought of Benson's volume as a similar tribute to Shakespeare. Benson also took from the Folio Milton's "An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, William Shakespeare," but where it is unsigned in the second Folio it is here signed "I. M." 43 Likewise, "An Elegie on the death of William Shakespeare, who died in Aprill, Anno Dom. 1616," is here signed "W.B." This famous elegy was printed among John Donne's poems in 1633 but omitted from the volume of 1635. 44 William Basse was still living in 1640 and the inclusion of his poem in Benson's Poems may have been arranged by the author. The final elegy is anonymous and is followed by "Finis." Benson no doubt hoped to make a little money on this volume, but he took considerable pains with it, not only by the elaborate (if mistaken) rearrangement of two neglected volumes of lyrics, but by the additions, and the various tributes which had come into his possession, some probably from Cotes, but perhaps others from Aspley, Wright, or some other acquaintance who had collected some bits of Shakespeariana. The Poems of 1640 is not a pirated edition of Shake-speares Sonnets but an edition to rescue them from oblivion, as it did. When they were reprinted, in 1710 their editor reprinted Benson's text. He had never heard of Thorpe's Quarto, but that is another story.</field>

He himself edited the facsimile where they do not. The titles are all Benson's. 6 These are nos. 18, 19, 43, 56, 75, 76, 96, and 126. The last two may have been thought defective because 96 repeats the couplet of 36, and 126 has two pair of empty brackets instead of a final couplet. The other two pairs and two odd sonnets could have been simply missed. A group of miscellaneous sonnets at the end of Benson's rearrangement, nos. 107, 108, 78, 79, 73 and 77, may indicate that six more were caught at the last moment. 7 Reproduced in facsimile with an introduction by H. E. Rollins (1940). Two earlier editions, both apparently published in 1599, have been edited in facsimile, one by Sidney Lee (1905), and the other by J. Q. Adams (1939). There is no reason to suppose that Benson knew anything about Heywood's protest at the false attribution of his poems and Jaggard's substitution of a new title page without Shakespeare's name in part of this edition.

Thorpe's name is connected with some 40 publishing ventures between 1600 and 1625, but only three times did he publish a second edition.

Aspley was also a renter warden, acted as arbitrator many times, and was involved in other administrative affairs; see index, "Aspley." 23 Half of the surviving copies of the 1609 Quarto are marked, "At London By G. Eld for T. T. and are to be solde by Iohn Wright dwelling at Christ Church gate." The other half "are to be solde by William Aspley." Wright was just beginning to do business in 1609. His activities can be traced in Arber, and in Jackson more fully than in H. R. Plomer, Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers . . . 1641-1667 (1907). 24 Smethwick like Aspley took up his freedom in 1597, and like Aspley was a member of the Court of Assistants 1630-1640, like Aspley he was one of the publishers of both the first and second Folio. Both men were keepers of the English stock in 1637; Jackson, p. 291. Both paid 20 nobles to avoid being upper, or senior warden in 1637, both were among the auditors in 1638; Jackson, p. 298, p. 320. Smethwick was elected Master in July, 1639. 25 Jackson, p. 254. He had agreed to pay "to the house for the use of the Poore (according as usually hath byn . . . .) And he hath promised upon the finishing of the Booke to pay the same accordingly." 26 Jackson, p. 325. Greg, First Folio , p. 33, note 1, reports that Albovine , in the original edition was advertised for sale by Humphrey Moseley in 1653-60, and suggests that Benson did not print it because he learned that the old stock was still unsold. 27 Shortly after Jonson's death Digby wrote to Bryan Duppa, the editor of Jonsonus Virbius , that he would "as soon as I can" make the world "share with me" "those excellent pieces (alas that many of them are but pieces!) which he hath left behind him and that I keepe religiously by me to that end." In 1659 (two decades later), Humphrey Moseley apologized for publishing The Last Remains of Sr John Suckling , citing for precedent the publication of Jonson's The Sad Shepherd , "judg'd a Piece of too much worth to be laid aside, by the Learned and Honorable Sir Kenelm Digby , who published that Volume." He had just bought the copyright to the volume from Walkley, so the source of his information is clear. Neither Digby nor Moseley mention editing, and the state of Walkley's text seems proof that no editing was done; Ben Jonson , ed. C. H. Herford and Percy and Evelyn Simpson, Vol. IX (1950), 102-103; and see J. C. Reed, "Humphrey Moseley, Publisher," Oxford Bibliographical Society, Proceedings and Papers, II, 1927-1930 (1930), p. 100. 28 The sole document in this affair is Thomas Walkley's petition to the Court of Chancery, sworn and filed January 20, 1640, printed by Frank Marcham, "Thomas Walkley and the Ben Jonson 'Works' of 1640," The Library , 4th Ser., IX (1930), 225-229. Under the same title W. W. Greg interpreted this document in the same volume, pp. 461-465. The account in Ben Jonson , IX, 88-128, is slightly inaccurate and very hostile to Benson, accepting Walkley's plea as the whole truth. 29 Arber, IV, 500. The editors of Ben Jonson are mistaken on IX, 126, when they attribute to Benson the entry of March 20 of The Masque of Augurs , Time Vindicated , Neptune's Triumph , Pan's Anniversary , with sundry Elegies and other Poems. This entry was to Andrew Crooke and Richard Seirger, as they report correctly on p. 97. 30 Benson first published the Exercration against Vulcan: with diverse Epigrams , including "His Mistresse Drawne," and "Her Minde" already printed in the Poems . This is a thin Quarto. Then he published in duodecimo Q. Horatius Flaccus: His Art of Poetry . With other Workes of the Author, never printed before . This volume contains not only the Masque of the Gypsies , but also all of the pieces in the first volume. It is dedicated to the Right Honourable Thomas Lord Windsore by Benson who acknowledges "The Extension of your Noble Favours" which "commands" the presentation, and has also some commendatory verses by Sir Edward Herbert, Barton Holyday, Zouch Townley, and an "Ode. To Ben Jonson upon his Ode to himself," signed "I. C." Obviously, this was not a hasty and surreptitious volume, as the trouble taken with the text of the Masque also testifies. 31 Crooke had secured the right to reprint the contents of the 1616 Folio of Jonson's Works , and this volume appeared as Volume I of the edition of 1640, "by Richard Bishop, and are to be sold by Andrew Crooke in S t Paules Churchyard." Crooke, who specialized in plays, also had publishing rights to two of the three of Jonson's plays printed by John Beale in 1631 for Robert Allot. This edition was never completed, and probably Crooke acquired the unsold sheets when Allot died in 1635; see Ben Jonson , IX, 85. 32 Plomer, Dictionary , "Parker, John," reports that he had a large interest in the Latin stock of the Company. In 1620 he held the copyright to Venus and Adonis and published an edition. In his will he left a ring to Andrew Crooke. 33 Jackson, pp. 204-208. Aspley submitted in 1628, but Parker not until January, 1630; Jackson, p. 223. 34 Walkley failed to enter STC nos. 1399, 1400, 6779 (in 1636), 11074, 11057 ( Brittain's Ida by G. Fletcher, the Younger, which Walkley falsely attributed to E. Spenser), 12026 (perhaps pirated), 11095 (in 1635), 6306 (in 1639), 25890 ( The Workes of G. Wither , see Percy Simpson, "Walkley's Piracy of Withers Poems in 1620," The Library , 4th Ser. VI (1925), 271-277), two of Jonson's Masques, nos. 14762 and 14776, 14718, 14719, and some other pieces. A study of Walkley's publications and of the probable source of his text of Othello is in preparation. 35 Ben Jonson , IX, 103-104. Walkley's part consists of four sections, of which the last title in each of the two last sections has the imprint "London, Printed M.DC. XLI." Jonson's editors conjecture that the third and fourth sections were being printed simultaneously and were unfinished when John Parker "swooped down on the printing-office and impounded the stock." Evidently there were fewer of Allot's sheets than of Walkley's for the Folger Library, STC no. 14745a, has a copy which begins with The Divell is an Asse , reprinted and dated 1641. The other two plays of Allot's part are missing. Crooke had copyright to them. Meighen's title page is also missing. 36 G. E. B. Eyre and C. R. Rivington, A Transcript of the Registers of the Worshipful Company of Stationers, 1640-1708 (1913-1914), II, 196, 206. Here it is designated "Volume III." 37 Rollins, ibid., says from Fletcher's Bloody Brother , entered Oct. 4, 1639 and published the same year, but collation shows that this is improbable. 38 Probably also from a manuscript copy. It has one obvious error in common with the Folio text, III, ii, 133-162, and one significant variant. 39 Edited by A. B.

      <field name="heading_text">A Date and a Printer for A Looking Glasse for London and England , Q4 by Berta Sturman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his Bibliography of English Printed Drama [no. 118], Sir Walter Greg places the undated University of Chicago copy of A Looking Glasse for London and England (first printed 1594) between Q1602 (c) and Q1617 (e), remarking "it is not clear whether the edition is actually earlier than (e) or not; it is, however, placed here because it was printed page for page from (c) and is, like the earlier editions, in black letter." C. R. Baskervill thinks it came well before the 1617 quarto: "In fact, it may have followed close on Q3." 1 J. Churton Collins (see the preface in Volume I of his edition of Greene, 1905) refers to it as Q5. There is no internal evidence of date, except that three references to the Queen occur in the last scene in the editions of 1594, 1598, and 1602. Baskervill notes that these have been retained in the undated quarto, whereas the edition of 1617 refers to the King. But this is inconclusive, since references to Elizabeth were occasionally retained in texts printed during the reign of James. For example, the 1610 Quarto of Histrio-mastix employs the speech by Queen Elizabeth, and the 1606 Quarto of The Return from Parnassus contains an allusion to the Queen's day [III,1] and a reference to breaking the Queen's peace [IV,2]. We must turn, then, to the external evidence of printing practices. This undated Q4 contains no distinguishing ornaments or initials, such as appear in the earlier quartos, except a lace ornament. It is almost impossible to distinguish watermarks in the paper, but there seem to be traces of two different marks. All those distinguishing features which are sometimes helpful in dating an undated text seem to be wanting. However, a further expedient remains. Q4 follows, page for page, the 1602 edition, but it does not look like the work of the shop which printed the first three editions. Greg says of it: "The printer has not been identified, but the work is very inferior and is unlikely to be Creede's." 2 Close examination of this text, then, might reveal individual peculiarities to identify the press from which it was issued. One such peculiarity is immediately apparent. At the beginning of the text, on A2, is a lace ornament, a regular printers' substitute for the more costly woodblock or engraving. The piece of type is cast into an abstract design rather than a letter of the alphabet. A dozen or more such identical pieces seem to have accompanied a printer's stock of letters. Usually such type ornaments are placed in the forme in such a way that a regular pattern will result, most often a simple repetition like /// or \\\;. Sometimes two or four of the ornaments are placed in positions which combine to form a larger pattern, like this: ⋀ or this: ◇. This larger pattern is repeated until the space at the compositor's disposal has been filled. For this text, at least, the compositor seems to have inserted the pieces into his composing-stick at random. It is this lack of arrangement, rather than any peculiarity of the individual pieces of type, which is unusual. One other irregularity meets the eye at once. Printing-house custom seems to have been to sign texts with Arabic numbers, although some black-letter texts were signed with Roman. This quarto of A Looking Glasse has seven gatherings signed with Arabic numbers, two with Roman. So far as I can see there is no evidence of more than one compositor at work here — only of one confused or hurried man, haphazardly using now one system, now the other, in an unusual way. The play was printed with a mixed font. This was frequent practice during the last years of the period when black-letter fonts were being slowly replaced by italic fonts. Even in the smallest printing houses, damaged types were discarded as soon as they were discovered. When a letter came to be in short supply the quantity was pieced out by the addition of some from a similar but not necessarily identical font. Such a makeshift would serve until a fresh supply of type was secured. Knowledge of such mixed fonts can be useful to the scholar upon occasion, for a distinctive combination tends to recur over a short time but disappears over a longer period. The black-letter work of Valentine Simmes, for example, shows double forms of the capital letters C, E, G, H, P, T, and Y in 1597 and 1599, but in 1604 double forms occur only for C, T, and W. In the Chicago copy only the capitals D and M show such a mixed font. Each of these letters appears in a normal black-letter form (two slender uprights appear just to the right of the heavy, slightly curved, vertical of the D, and a slender upright line stands on either side of the central heavy vertical of the M), and also in a slightly different form (only one stroke follows the vertical of the D; the slender upright appears only to the right of the central shaft of the M). These variant D's and M's appear haphazardly, the variant D a little more frequently than the variant M. In addition, a broken form of the capital G appears. In it a piece of the back is missing and a part of each one of the inner vertical lines. The break seems to be diagonal; the missing part of the left-hand vertical is above the missing piece of the right-hand line. I sought, therefore, a small printing house where the workmanship was not very careful, whose work showed several of these characteristics: a jumbled type ornament, mixed Arabic and Roman numerals in the signatures, a mixed font showing variant capital M's and D's, and a capital G broken in a particular way. The earliest example I have found of such printing is not a complete text at all, but the last three gatherings of a larger work. In Dekker's Bachelors' Banquet , 1603, the signatures H-K seem to be of different workmanship. The running-titles are different and the type seems to be more worn. The variant D does not appear, but the variant M is present on H3 v , H4, and K2. The broken G occurs on H2 v . All the signature numbers in these three gatherings are set in Roman rather than Arabic numbers. F. P. Wilson, in the preface to his edition of The Bachelor's Banquet , explains that there were really two 1603 editions of this text, both by Creede, and that when it was decided to print up a second edition to satisfy the popular demand, Creede printed the second edition (1603b), the one in which we are here interested, from the first (1603a). Presumably to expedite matters, 1603b was set up in three sections: A-D, E-G, and H-K. 3 Both the 1603 editions carry the imprint "Printed by T. C. and are to be solde by T. P. 1603." The initials T. P. undoubtedly stand for Thomas Pavier, the publisher for whom Creede had printed the 1602 edition of A Looking Glasse . In 1603 also appeared an anonymous pamphlet, Present Remedies Against the Plague , printed for Pavier and carrying his device but bearing no printer's name. In it appear both forms of the D and M and the broken G. A lace ornament, similar to that in A Looking Glasse , is used here for a headpiece, the type dropped in, in no particular order. In 1604 the play Jacke Straw (Greg, no. 114) was similarly printed for Pavier with no printer's name. In it we find the variant D's and M's and the broken G, the same kind of ornament used in the same haphazard fashion, and signature marks which, although they contain no Roman numerals, are somewhat erratic, no signature at all appearing on A3, B3, C3, D3, E2, or E3. Finally, in 1605, we find three plays which apparently belong to this same group. In 1605 Pavier published The Fair Maid of Bristowe (Greg, no. 211), Captaine Thomas Stukeley (Greg, no. 220), and The First Part of Jeronimo (Greg, no. 221). All appeared with Pavier's device on the title page. Stukeley , Jacke Straw , and A Looking Glasse were on a list of twelve titles (Greg, p. 16) transferred to Pavier in 1600; The Fair Maid of Bristowe was entered to Pavier on 8 February 1604-5. Although The Fair Maid is the latest title in the group to be entered, it may have been printed at the same time as the other two Pavier plays. Greg says of it: "The printer has not been identified . . .the typographical arrangement, however, closely resembles that of Captaine Thomas Stukeley . . . and I Jeronimo . . ., and all three no doubt came from the same press." Not only is the typography of these three plays generally similar, but all three show the variant D's and M's, and in Stukeley the broken G occurs. The disordered ornament appears as a tailpiece in I Jeronimo and in The Fair Maid . A combination of Roman and Arabic numbers is employed in the signatures of all three. One more book may be included in this group. A Canterbury Visitation Article for 1605 (STC no. 10158), printed by R. Blower for T. Pavier, seems to have been set from the same font of black-letter type. The disordered lace ornament appears on A2 v and C3 v . Only the second of the three signatures is signed with Roman numerals. There are no variant D's, but the variant M occurs on A4 v , B1, B1 v , and B2. We have then seven texts and a part of an eighth, all of which show the confused ornament, the mixed Arabic and Roman type in the signatures, a mixed font showing variant capital M's and D's, and a capital G broken in a special way. The confused ornament appears as a headpiece in Jacke Straw . In a different but equally haphazard arrangement it serves a similar purpose in A Looking Glasse . It is used a tailpiece in The Faire Maid , and in I Jeronimo . In the Visitation Article and in Present Remedies it occurs twice: at the beginning and at the end of the text. The same pieces of type may, and probably do, appear and reappear, but their arrangement is always different and apparently random. Signing of the third leaf in a gathering is regularly omitted in Jacke Straw , and in the second sheet only the first leaf is signed. Otherwise, this volume seems to have fairly regular signatures in its five gatherings. The same practice of omitting the signature on the third leaf occurs twice in Captaine Thomas Stukeley , however, and twice in I Jeronimo , both of which show a mixture of Roman and Arabic numbers in their signatures. Of our eight texts, five show such a combination, and all five, except for A Looking Glasse , are dated 1605. On the three gatherings which this printer did for The Bachelor's Banquet , only the variant M appears. The variant forms for both the D and the M occur in the plague pamphlet, as they do in all of the plays in the group. The Visitation Article , like The Bachelor's Banquet , shows no variant D's. This may be taken to mean that an extra supply of capital D's became available before the Article was printed, but it more probably reflects only the brevity of the texts involved. In both instances only three sheets were printed. The broken G occurs in four of our texts: on H2 v of The Bachelor's Banquet (1603), on A3 and C4 v of Jacke Straw (1604), on D4 and F2 v of Captaine Thomas Stukeley (1605), and on F2 of A Looking Glasse for London and England . The Visitation Article bears the name of Ralph Blower as printer, and this suggests that the other seven typographically similar texts probably came from Blower's press. Consequently I examined twenty-one of the thirty texts which Morrison lists as printed by Blower between 1600 and 1616. Of these, only the 1605 Visitation Article shows three of the peculiarities described above. Two other works (STC nos. 5876 and 11232), both printed in 1607, have an ornament like that in A Looking Glasse but bear none of the other characteristics. The other eighteen examined show none of the typographical peculiarities of A Looking Glasse . In 1603 Blower printed London's Mourning Garment (STC no. 16757) and in 1607 The Court of Good Counsel (STC no. 5876). Both are in black letter but neither comes from a font with mixed M's and D's or with a broken letter G. Seven texts that do show one or more of these variant letters are dated between 1603 and 1607. This suggests that the Chicago copy of A Looking Glasse was also printed between 1603 and 1607. It may be possible to suggest a more precise dating. The disordered lace ornament recurs steadily from 1603 through 1607, but the mixed D's and M's disappear after 1605 and the broken G appears only in 1603, 1604, and 1605. Moreover, the mingling of Roman and Arabic numbers in the signatures occurs only in 1605. On this evidence one might say that Q4 of A Looking Glasse was probably printed between 1603 and 1605, very possibly in the winter of 1604/5, and that it is indeed the fourth edition. Except for his portion of The Bachelor's Banquet , Blower printed all of this group of texts for Pavier. He apparently undertook a little emergency work for Pavier or Creede when The Bachelor's Banquet was being hurried off the press and, despite the fact that his work is not equal to Creede's, received additional work from Pavier in succeeding years. Creede had printed A Looking Glasse for Pavier in 1602 (c) and may have parcelled out this subsequent edition to Blower in much the same way that he had employed Blower in the printing of The Bachelor's Banquet in 1603. Printing rights in the play, however, had belonged to Pavier since 1600 and it seems more likely that Q4 A Looking Glasse (d) was one in a group of five plays that Blower printed for Pavier in 1604-1605 quite independently of Creede. It is evident that Blower did not invariably put his name to everything that issued from his press. Of those to which his name or initials are appended there seem to be no very lengthy or important works. He appears to have been a very minor London printer of such things as Visitation Articles, sermons, pamphlets, etc. In 1615 he was returned as having one press and there is no particular reason to surmise that he had ever had more. Immediately after the close of his apprenticeship he evidently was associated with the Jaggards, one of whom, John, had been a fellow-apprentice under Tottell. In 1600, however, Blower and William Jaggard were fined for printing Sherley's Journey . Blower does not seem to have printed for Jaggard thereafter. In 1600 he printed Webbe's Rare and Most Wonderfull Things for Pavier. During the years between 1602 and 1608, Pavier's name appears as publisher on most of the title pages issuing from Blower's press. The addition of these seven texts makes the association inescapable. Blower's name occasionally appears alone, and once in a while he printed for another publisher, but for the most part his limited printing facilities seem to have been used in Pavier's service.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Eighteenth-Century Editions of Steele's Conscious Lovers by Shirley Strum Kenny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Sir Richard Steele's long-promised play The Conscious Lovers opened at the Drury Lane Theatre on 7 November 1722, it was assured a long run by advance publicity and a critical controversy. Rumors that Steele was writing a remarkable play had circulated for years. Now audacious puffs informed newspaper readers that it was "the very best that ever came upon the English Stage." 1 Advertisements announced new costumes and sets for the production. The critic John Dennis, irked at the publicity, attacked the play in a pamphlet published five days before the opening. Even after such unusual press agentry, the comedy's success probably exceeded expectations. An unusually long first run of eighteen nights brought the Drury Lane company £2,536/3/6 — more, according to Steele, than any play previously performed. 2 There were eight more performances during the season. Pamphleteers and newspaper wits spent months ridiculing it, defending it, and occasionally attempting responsible criticism. The market for copies of The Conscious Lovers could only be great. On 20 October, eighteen days before the opening, Steele assigned publication rights to Jacob Tonson Jr. for £40 and "divers other good Causes and Considerations." Half of the rights were reassigned by Tonson to Bernard Lintot on 26 October, and on 1 December the play was issued with the date 1723 on the title-page. 3 "Many thousand" copies were printed, and "a good part" of these were immediately sold, according to Tonson. 4 Actually there are three editions with the Tonson imprint dated 1723 although they were not labelled as different editions and they have never been correctly distinguished and identified. 5 The physical evidence of the three, summarized below, shows a very large and complex first edition, the "many thousand" Tonson speaks of; a smaller second edition which quickly followed the first; and a third to meet the continuing demand for copies. The title-page of one edition, designated I in the present discussion, reads: THE | Conscious Lovers. | A | COMEDY. | As it is Acted at the | Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane , | By His MAJESTY's Servants. | Written by | Sir RICHARD STEELE. | Illud Genus Narrationis, quod in Personis positum est , | debet habere Sermonis Festivitatem, Animorum Dissi- | militudinem, Gravitatem, Lenitatem, Spem, Metum , | Suspicionem, Desiderium, Dissimulationem, Miseri- | cordiam, Rerum Varietates, Fortunœ Commutationem , | Insperatum Incommodum, Subitam Letitiam, Jucundum | Exitum Rerum . Cic. Rhetor. ad Herenn. Lib. I. | LONDON: | Printed for J. Tonson at Shakespear's Head over-| against Katharine-Street in the Strand . 1723. The title-pages of the other two editions, here designated II and III, are identical except for one line-division between the fourth and fifth lines of the motto (I: Miseri- | cordiam ; II, III: Misericor- | diam ). All three are octavos with the collational formula A-F 8 G 4 . Although there are differences in line-divisions, there is only one variation in pages: the last line of A5 v in I is the first line of A6 in II and III. A quick glance at substantive variants in the three editions will verify that II must be the intermediate text: Page and line I II III A6 v .17 told me told me told 5.14 I'm I am I am 6.17 came came come 7.34 there is there's there's 8.1 Ay, Sir Sir Sir 10.37 a Part Part Part 14.17 greater greater great 19.17 his his this 22.1 But I I I 29.4 thing right thing right right thing 36.28 these those those 42.25 God Good Good 43.22 has he has he he has 49.29 to beget beget beget 52.1 plain,plainly (two states) plain plain 67.38 I a a I I a 71.34 Geoffry Sir Geoffry Sir Geoffry 75.28 I lost I lost lost Text II agrees in variants with each of the other texts almost an equal number of times. In the only instance in which II contains a variant found in neither I nor III, 67.38, the variant is an obvious misprint ("Oh! were a I Man —") easily caught by a copy-editor or compositor and corrected in the later edition. A similar pattern of agreement in accidentals and line-divisions of II sometimes with I and sometimes with III supplies further evidence that II was either the second of the three texts or the copy-text for both I and III. Editions I and II were printed in very quick succession. The type from the first of the two editions had not been distributed before the second was begun; some of the same type, recognizable by broken letters, appears in both settings. The reused type includes the outer forme of sheet C, the inner forme of sheet E (except E3 v , p. 54), and the following pages: A3 v , B1 v (p. 2), B8 (p. 15), E4 v (p. 56), E5 (p. 57), F5 v (p. 74), and G2 v (p. 84). The fact that pages from seven formes were left undistributed at one time indicates that at least one of these two editions, I and II, must have been very large and hastily printed. The hurried edition would likely be the first, when the printers worked to satisfy an eager public. This edition would probably also be the largest, as Tonson's estimate of "many thousand" suggests. Of 36 copies examined in connection with this paper, only three are text III, (at the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, and Harvard), and two are II (at Yale and the Bodleian). The other 31 are I. Assuming that survival gives an indication of the size of the printing, edition I must have been issued in far greater numbers than either II or III. Also, edition I required an unusually complex printing job. The type seems to have been repeatedly tied and stored, then reused. Running-titles vary from copy to copy, suggesting that the type pages were several times inserted in chases for press-runs. The only formes in which running-titles remained unchanged in the fourteen copies I collated were A, G, and outer E, with the exception of E3 (p. 53) on which three variant running-titles appear in different copies. It seems probable that the runs of outer E and G were extended when more copies were needed. A was removed from the chase, but the running-titles were tied up with the type. A few examples will indicate the complexity of printing edition I. Sheets B-G of two Folger Library copies utilized seven sets of running-titles, an abnormally large number for a play printed in this period. These two copies both contain the same impression of six formes (see chart below). Further, as the chart shows, the running-titles on the inner forme of B in both copies also head the outer forme of C in one, the outer forme of D in the other. The running-titles of the outer forme of F in both are used in inner D and outer B in one and inner E in the other. A chart of the sets of running-titles of these two copies shows the complications of the printing job and perhaps of the gathering of sheets: Sets of running-titles Identical running-titles in both copies In PR3704 1723a In 134674 1 B(i) C(o) D(o) 2 C(i) E(i) B(o) 3 F(o) D(i), B(o) E(i) 4 F(i), E(o) 5 C(o), (D (i) 6 D(o) 7 G (half-sheet imposition?) One running-title from set 2 recurs in set 5. Four from set 4 recur in set 6, one in a different location. The running-title in set 2 which appears on C2 and E2 occurs in a different position for B3: normally it would have been on B1, which has no running-title, but it was moved to B3, the same position in the chase as C4, an act opening with no running-title. Yet these two copies of edition I, of different impressions in five formes, are far more closely related than many other extant copies. They share, for example, at least five of six press-figures, and perhaps the sixth (one copy has a press-figure on G4; the other lacks this leaf). A copy at Yale University suggests the extent of variation found in edition I. Its running-titles agree with neither Folger copy except in A, G, and the outer forme of E. The only press-figure that it shares with either marks the outer forme of E. Instead of the Folger's five and six press-figures, it has eleven. Copies found in the Library of Congress, Princeton, Columbia (two), University of California, and the Huntington Library all share thirteen press-figures, but only three of the figures agree with the copy at Yale and another three with the two in the Folger Library. Most copies, in fact, add to the complexity of identification of the impressions of I: formes with the same press-figures may vary in running-titles; formes may vary in press-figures but not in running-titles; or they may vary in both. The following table shows the varying press-figures or lack of them in different copies of I: Forme Pages and press-figures A(i) A7 v -7; none A(o) A8 v -7; A8 v -broken 2 * ; none B(i) 11-4; 11-2; none B(o) 16-4; 16-2; none C(i) 31-2; 31-4; none C(o) 32-2; 20-7; none D(i) 47-6; 47-2; none D(o) 48-7; 48-2; none E(i) 62-7; 62-2; none E(o) 64-4; 64-3 F(i) 78-2; none F(o) 68-2; 68-3; none G 87-6; 82-7; none These press figures occur in fifteen combinations in the 31 examined copies. The heavy use of the figures, particularly when added to the wide variation in running-titles, indicates extraordinary printing practices. Although the same type, with some corrections, was used throughout the edition, sometimes the type shifted, a result of its being removed and reinserted in chases. For example, on p. 21 the words "to me" and "or taking" in lines 30-31 become "tome" and "ortaking" in some copies. Further, ornaments were used, removed from the pages, and then reinserted when the run was extended. This is most obviously apparent from an examination of the factotum on A2, which appears with strapwork at top and bottom in some copies of I and at the sides in others. In those copies in which it is at the sides, the initial appears in three different positions. The press-figures, running-titles, and ornaments in I, then, would all suggest that the play was printed on a large scale and the type was saved and reused several times for different impressions within the edition. In contrast, the printing of edition III is quite regular. Running-titles show that one press printed the inner forme of B, both formes of C, the outer forme of F, and G by half-sheet imposition. A second press printed both formes of D and both formes of E. A third was used for the outer forme of B and the inner forme of F; it seems likely that this press also printed A, although lack of running-title evidence makes it impossible to be sure. There was greater concern for correction in I than II or III, and in the end the order of editions can be ascertained through examining the variants of I, in relation to II. They include: Forme Page and line First state Second state A(1) A7 v .catchword And Your B(i) 3.35 alone, (cor.) (?) alone 7.29-30 Cone|science (?) Con-|science B(o) 13.16 Myrtle . Myrtle? C(i) 18.7 you, you. 18.32 but, but 19.2 seiz'd, seiz'd 19.32 and, and E(i) 51.catchword plain plain- 55.10 his own his 55.33 me hence 59.29 ather rather E(o) 52.1 plain plainly 53.26 if, if 56.39 is. (cor.) is F(o) 68.24 Mannor Manor 68.28 Mr Mr. Variants occur in four other formes in which the order of the states is incapable of proof: C(o) 28.6 Letter . Letter D(i) 34.16 Drawing-Room.-- Drawing-Room-- D(o) 44.37 seen, seen F(i) 71.catchword Myrt . Myr The derivation of the second edition, suggested by the size and complexity of I, can be proved by comparison of the two states of sheet E in I with II. II is identical with the corrected state of inner E. It is like the uncorrected state of outer E except that an obvious error (53.26) has been corrected. The result is that while the catchword "plain-" on p. 51 of II indicates that p. 52 should begin with "plainly", actually it begins with "plain". This could result if II followed I and was printed from the corrected state of inner E and the uncorrected state of outer E. It would be impossible, however, for the variants in the two states of I to follow from copy-text II. Therefore I must be the earlier edition. Since II is unquestionably the intermediate text, III can only be the third edition. With I established as the first edition, its variants have some bearing on an authoritative text of the play. Almost all of them are clearly errors corrected in the second state. The two marked "(cor.)" above are correct readings in the first state; in each case type may have been pulled out by the ink balls or lost in the process of moving the page in and out of the chase. The variants in outer C, outer D, and inner F probably fit into this category also. The first listed reading of each is obviously correct. The order is debatable in outer B although " Myrtle ?" is the better reading. The only other forme in which obvious errors were not corrected and therefore the order of the states might be questioned is the inner forme of E, in which two substantive changes were made. Here, however, the evidence of the order is incontrovertible: page 55, containing the two variants, is one of those pages of type in edition I which was reused in II. The type found in II could only be the last state of I. The catchword "plain" on p. 51 in this forme was changed to "plain-" in the second state when the first word on p. 52, "plain", was changed to "plainly" in the sentence, "But, Sir, I see very plainly what you are going into." As one would expect, there are fewer copies of the uncorrected state of the two formes of sheet E, ten of 31 examined copies. There are, of course, variants in the running-titles also. " Coonscius " occurs in the running-titles of p. 71 (F4) in eleven copies and p. 53 (E3) in five of the eleven. This suggests that the aberrant running-title was used throughout one press-run of inner F but was detected after outer E was in the same chase. Two other entirely different settings occur on p. 53, but the other running-titles in the forme do not change. Although sheets were gathered in various mixtures, examination of these 31 copies suggests that, on the whole, uncorrected sheets were gathered together and corrected sheets were. The oddity of this sharp division makes it seem that at least most of the corrections were made between press-runs. One exception is the inner forme of B; "early" copies are found with what appears to be the corrected forme of outer B and all other sheets. It is possible that the "first" state of inner B is actually a later state with p. 3 (alone,) corrected. The hyphen on p. 7 (Con-|science) could have been lost in moving the type and the error introduced by an unwary printer repairing the line. Examples of early copies of I include Yale copy 1 and two in the Bodleian shelf-marked Malone B 109 and G.P. 63 (1); later examples are the two at the Folger, Yale copy 3, two at the University of Texas, and Bodleian 8° E66 (2) Jur. Because one can distinguish early from late, it becomes possible to establish the authoritative text including substantive revisions. There is also ample proof of the immediate demand for thousands of copies of the printed play. Moreover, one can recognize the scope and complexity of the printing job, a clue to the capabilities of the print shop in 1722, when most if not all of the type for a book of 104 pages could be stored and reused again and again. 6 Tonson was able to stop a London piracy advertised for 8 December 1722 by a restraining order and then an injunction issued 11 December against Francis Clifton, Robert Tooke, John Lightbody, and Susanna Collins. 7 Two other editions, however, were immediately published outside England to take advantage of the interest in Steele's play. A duodecimo dated 1722 was printed in Dublin by A. Rhames for J. Hyde, R. Gunne, R. Owen, E. Dobson, and P. Dugan. An octavo dated 1723 was issued by T. Johnson with the imprint London, although it was probably printed at The Hague late in 1722. Both of these unapproved editions followed the early state of the first edition. Neither has any authority. The great number of later eighteenth-century editions and translations of The Conscious Lovers attests its continuing appeal. The "Third Edition" was published with Tonson's imprint in 1730, the year after Steele's death. The first edition served as copy-text for this duodecimo. Inexplicably, its readings of the variants on page 55 of the first edition are "his" and "me", a combination that could not result from the copy-text. The "Fourth Edition", dated 1733, was printed for Tonson and sold by W. Feales. An engraving by Gerard Van der Gucht was introduced. In 1735 Tonson published another edition. In the same year Feales produced a similar edition, bearing his own imprint and including an imitation of the Van der Gucht engraving, a carefully copied but reversed image. The title-page of this apparently pirated edition bears an imitation of the Shakespeare's head printed on Tonson's 1735 title-page. Tonson's copyright expired in 1736. A new edition appeared in 1740 with the imprint "Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country" and a second imitation of the Van der Gucht frontispiece. The imprint and engraving suggest Robert Walker as the printer, a probability strengthened by small numbers at the bottom of D1 and G1 similar to those used by Walker to designate the parts in which he issued many plays in the 1730's. 8 Jacob and Richard Tonson published another edition in 1741. The delay of eight years after the first three editions, followed by the printing of six in 1730-41 parallels the play's repertory popularity, which reached its peak in the 1730's and 1740's. The Conscious Lovers continued in demand both on stage and in print in London and elsewhere. By the end of the century, however, performances began to diminish while new editions increased. With a growing list of partners, the Tonsons published it in 1747, 1751, 1755, 1760, 1764, and 1767. Of these partners, Lowndes, Caslon, Nicoll, and Bladon joined with Strahan and others for still further editions in 1768, 1776, and 1782. Bell published several in his series (1776, 1782, 1791, and 1797), and Wenman issued one in 1778. Some of the later editions are cut as the stage production was, and in some the entire text is printed but the cuts are marked by inverted commas. Foreign publication also grew steadily. An Italian version was published in London in 1724, three French ones in Paris in 1736, 1778, and 1784, and two German ones in Dresden, 1752, and Leipzig, 1767. An English edition appeared in Göttingen in 1767. The play was also published in Dublin (1725, 1746, 1757, 1777, 1793, and 1795), Cork (1761), Belfast (1776), Edinburgh (1755, 1768, 1774 and two in 1782), and Glasgow (1782 and 1789). 9 Very possibly this list is not yet complete. Nevertheless, these 47 editions including six translations into three foreign languages demonstrate the continuing desire for copies of the comedy which had required such extraordinary printing procedure on first publication.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Laureate as Huckster: Nahum Tate and an Early Eighteenth Century Example of Publisher's Advertising by Stuart L. Astor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When John Seddon, an eminent calligrapher of the restoration, died in 1700, he left a number of unfinished designs in the hands of his friend and former pupil, Thomas Read. Read had not become a practising writing-master; he was instead clerk of St. Giles in the Fields. Nevertheless, some time after Seddon's death he decided to have his late friend's work completed and published, ostensibly so that the world might not lose examples of penmanship "both Useful and Delightful to the true Sons of Art." He approached George Shelley, another reputable calligrapher, and arranged to have Seddon's designs finished or, to use Read's word, "perfected." The volume which resulted was published in 1705 with the title, The Penman's Magazine: or, a New Copy-Book, of the English, French and Italian Hands, After the Best Mode; Adorn'd with about an hundred New and Open Figures and Fancies, Never before Publish'd: After the Originals of the Late Incomparable Mr. John Seddon . The Penman's Magazine consists of thirty-two plates engraved by John Nutting and printed, two per leaf, on the rectos of sixteen folio leaves. In addition to the title page there are five pages of preliminaries: one is Thomas Read's dedication, "To the Reader"; the other four, sig. B, contain a 146 line poem, "Upon this Performance of Penmanship, A Poem," by Nahum Tate, "Poet-Laureate to her Majesty." Like much of Tate's verse, this poem has little literary merit. Furthermore, while its occasional nature may shed some light on the private enterprise of that poet-laureate who had already chosen to write other poems on subjects as diverse as syphilis and tea, its place in Tate's canon is relatively unimportant. "Upon this Performance of Penmanship" is, however, a bibliographical oddity and may be the earliest surviving example of publisher's advertising of the eighteenth century, for after The Penman's Magazine was printed Tate's poem, retitled but not reset, was issued separately with a colophon added to show where and at what price copies of the Magazine could be obtained. The Penman's Magazine is not particularly rare. Columbia University, the New York Public Library, the Newberry Library, Yale University, and the British Museum, at least, own one or more copies in various collections. Among those I have seen I have found two variant states of a single issue. The earlier of these apparently went to subscribers and the later was sold to the public. I have found only one copy of the separately issued poem, however. This, which must be considered a second issue, is in the Plimpton collection of early textbooks at Columbia University and is called "On a New Copy-Book Entitl'd The Penman's Magazine, &amp;c, A Poem." The following descriptions are limited to the title pages and preliminaries of the Magazine as well as the new issue of the poem. Discussion of the calligraphic engravings would not only be out of place here but inconclusive, since most of the extant volumes I have seen are incomplete. The Wing Typographic Collection of the Newberry Library has two copies of The Penman's Magazine , one (Wing fZW 745.S547) in what appears to be its earliest state. Its title page, a transcription of which follows, bears no imprint, only the date of publication: The Penman's Magazine: [black letter] / OR, A / NEW COPY-BOOK, / OF THE / English, French and Italian / HANDS, / After the Best MODE; / Adorn'd with about an hundred [black letter] New and Open / FIGURES AND FANCIES, / Never before Publish'd: / After the ORIGINALS of the Late / Incomparable Mr. John Seddon . [rule] / Perform'd by George Shelley [black letter] WRITING-MASTER, / at the HAND and PEN in Warwick-Lane, London. / [rule] / Supervis'd and Publish'd by Thomas Read, [black letter] CLERK of St. Giles's / in the Fields, formerly a Scholar to the said Mr. SEDDON . / [rule] / Ann. Dom . MDCCV. In this copy, which I shall call the first state, the dedication to the reader (sig. [A] 2 r ) is followed by an unidentified epigraphic quotation: "Flourish may take him who a Letter Flies, / And turn Delight into an Exercise." The first page of Tate's poem has a signature mark, B, and the pages are numbered in square brackets, [1] - [4]. The text of the poem has only one marginal gloss, a reference to another poem by Tate, appearing on page 1 (sig. B1 r ). The other copy at the Newberry Library (Wing fZW 745.S548), as well as the other copies I have seen at Columbia, Yale, and the New York Public Library, varies in several ways and may be called the second state. The title page has not been reset, but a full imprint replaces the simple date of the first state: Sold by R. Parker , under the Piazza Royal-Exchange; J. Holland , at the Bible in Paul's-/ Alley , near St. Paul's Church; B. Lintott , at the Temple-Gate ; J. Dewell , at the Globe/ near the New-Exchange , in the Strand. Ann. Dom . MDCCV. Price 5 s. The epigraph below the dedication on sig. [A] 2 r has been eliminated. Much of the original setting of the poem is unchanged, but three marginal glosses have been added, two on page 2 and one on page 3. A catchword referring to the first plate has been added on page 4. Three spelling errors have been corrected, some punctuation has been changed and two words have been reset in italics. Most importantly, two whole lines and a word on page two have been changed substantially. Thus, "But still to Use and Imitation Lost," line 31 of the first state, becomes "But ah! almost to Use and Practice Lost," in the second; the first's line 40, "And, freed from Intricacy's cum-bring Chain," becomes the second's "Yet justly careful in the loosen'd Chain," and "a stronger champion," (first state, line 34) becomes "another Champion." 1 The separate issue of Tate's poem, an item of ephemera in Columbia's Plimpton Collection, retains most of the features of the second state described above. The printer who eliminated the catchword on its final page even neglected to remove the signature letter "B" from page 1. Apart from the eliminated catch word and the addition of the word "Finis" between the last line of the poem and the new colophon, three variants deserve comment. The poem's title, changed from "Upon this performance of Penmanship. A Poem" to "On a New Copy-Book, Entitl'd The Penman's Magazine, &amp;c. A Poem" appears to have been set wherever possible from the type used for the title pages of the earlier issue. Thus the black letter type of the words "The Penman's Magazine," and the large, bold letters of "New Copy-Book" were reimposed for the poem's title before the type was distributed. Although the printer may have saved time and labor setting the poem's title, he did not simply reimpose the imprint of the second state's title page as the colophon of the separate poem. The colophon, in fact, is newly composed and carries more information than the earlier imprint. It follows in full: The Copy-Book Sold by G. Shelley Writing-Master, at the Hand and Pen in Warwick-Lane / and T. Read , Clerk of St Giles's in the Fields: As also, by R. Parker , under the Royal Ex- / change; J. Holland , at the Bible in Paul's-Alley , near St. Paul's Church; B. Lintott , at the / Temple Gate; J. Dewell , at the Globe near the New-Exchange , in the Strand, London . 1705 / Price 5 s. A third and quite interesting variant occurs in one of the marginal glosses previously added to the second state and here expanded to triple its length. In the second state, lines 46-47, Tate writes "What Charming Wonder's That? * A Cloudness Moon/ Like Cynthia rais'd to her Nocturnal Noon;" and the gloss for those lines is cryptic enough to anyone who does not have the engravings at hand. It reads simply "* The C Copy ." The equivalent gloss to the same line in the separate poem reads "* A Crescent or Half-Moon Curiously perform'd in the Letter C ." These then are the three forms in which Nahum Tate's poem first appeared. Their sequence is easily determined, but leads to some interesting conjectures. The first state lacks a full imprint probably because it was issued directly to subscribers by Read and Shelley. In this state the lack of the marginal glosses later added to the poem to clarify the association of Read and Shelley with John Seddon also argues that the purchasers of the first issue were more familiar than the general public with the circumstances of its production. Perhaps the original subscribers were Shelley's own pupils, since all the lines corrected in the text of the poem for the second issue serve in the first to praise Shelley above Seddon, the creator of the original calligraphic designs. Harder to account for is the difference between the imprint of the second state and the colophon of the separately printed poem. The latter, in fact, is the only evidence that Read and Shelley themselves actually sold the Magazine , even though the title pages of both the first and second states identify Read as the work's publisher and Shelley as its performer. A likely explanation turns on the fact that The Penman's Magazine must have been a very expensive volume to produce. Even at five shillings per copy, a high price for the early eighteenth century, Read and Shelley probably had trouble clearing with the first issue what must have been a considerable investment in Nutting's engraved plates and the relatively high cost of printing them. Presumably the booksellers, Parker et al. , agreed to defray some part of the production costs in return for being allowed to issue the Magazine in its second state for public sale after the subscription copies had been run off. The exact financial arrangements cannot be known, but normal practice for the time suggests two possible contingencies. Under the first, Read and Shelley themselves would have seen no return from the public sale of the second state until the booksellers had covered their own costs and made a profit. Under the second, Read and Shelley themselves would have been responsible for all production costs until the booksellers had sold a predetermined number of copies of the second state. In either case, the more copies sold to the public, the more profit (or, at least, the less risk) to Read and Shelley. If the second state was not selling well, both the booksellers and the entrepreneurs would have benefited from the extra sales outlets at "the Hand and Pen" and St. Giles in the Fields. Here the separate issue of Tate's poem becomes significant as an advertising device. When it appeared the full edition of the Magazine , both plates and preliminaries, must already have been printed, since the poem's title is partially set with the same type used for the title pages of the first and second states of the Magazine . Hence, any investment Read and Shelley or the booksellers may have made in publication costs had already been made. One might argue that some copies of the poem must have been run off for Tate's own use or even to be sold as literature (although there is absolutely no evidence that the poem was sold at all), but these purposes would not have justified the new title, nor would they account for the expanded gloss — clearly an attempt to interest the public in seeing the Magazine — or the colophon, which lists six places at which the copy-book could be bought, as well as its price per copy. Unquestionably the poem was used for advertising in the modern sense of the word. Even the evident cost of producing the poem — in addition to whatever Tate may have been paid for the work, each separate copy of the poem requires the apparently extravagant use of a full sheet of paper — suggests an analogy with modern advertising budgets. If, as has been proposed, the poem was issued to offset poor initial sales of the Magazine , the attempt must have been almost desperate. If these conjectures seem to explain the differences between the Magazine's imprint and the poem's colophon, they raise another problem: to argue that the poem was issued to rescue a failing publishing venture is also to argue that the type for the preliminaries of the Magazine was left standing long enough for that venture to be evaluated. This in turn suggests either that the publishers were prepared to print another issue of the Magazine should the earlier ones have proved successful, or that they were aware that the copy-book might not sell well and were ready in advance to use Tate's poem as advertising. The first suggestion is the more likely, but the second cannot be overlooked. In his recent study of commendatory verses as advertising devices, Franklin B. Williams, Jr. mentions none that were separately issued, but he proves that through the mid-seventeenth century at least, the presence of commendatory verses could affect sales. He goes on to say, however, that "by about 1700 the sophisticated literary world had assumed a condescending attitude [toward commendatory verses], and in the Eighteenth century the practice lapsed into unimportance." 2 No doubt this is true, and although the public for Read's copy-book probably had little to do with the sophistocated literary world Tate's poem is nothing more than a bibliographical oddity. Nevertheless, "On a New Copy-Book, Entitl'd The Penman's Magazine, &amp;c. A Poem" is a far more complex advertising device than the earlier verses surveyed by Williams. Furthermore, it uses far more sophisticated techniques than the "rubric on the walls,/ Or plaistered posts, with claps, in capitals," the advertising of books through publicly displayed title pages, of which Alexander Pope speaks in his "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot," published twenty-eight years later than The Penman's Magazine .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "Another," for "a stronger" is not likely to be a correction rather than a change. The earlier version, "a stronger champion," refers to George Shelley and would, if let alone, elevate him over the master being commemorated, John Seddon. 2 "Commendatory Verses: The Rise of the Art of Puffing," Studies in Bibliography , XIX (1966), 4. A verse comment by the Elizabethan translator Richard Robinson quoted by Williams, p. 10, might be distorted into suggesting that MS copies of commendatory verses were circulated in advanced of publication: "I have been showne / Bookes that sell well, yet not for what's their own, / but for Commendators before them knowne." Unfortunately the statement clearly implies that the commendators' reputations, not their verses, were known ahead of time to the public.</field>
