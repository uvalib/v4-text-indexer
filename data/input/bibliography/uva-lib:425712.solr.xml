      <field name="heading_text">Marlowe's Doctor Faustus : The 1602 Additions by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The early editors of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus knew only the B-text, which had its first edition in 1616, until in 1850 Alexander Dyce printed both the A-text of 1604 and the B-text of 1616, a procedure followed by Peter Cunningham. However, the next editor, A. H. Bullen, in 1885 selected the A-version as his copy-text on the belief that it alone represented the pure original play whereas the 1616 text was a later revised version containing the additions for which Henslowe on 22 November 1602 paid £4 on behalf of the Admiral's men to Samuel Rowley and William Birde, or Borne. Bullen's hypothesis was followed by Tucker Brooke in his influential 1910 edition of Marlowe. This view prevailed until in 1946 Leo Kirschbaum exploded the bombshell of "The Good and Bad Quartos of Doctor Faustus " ( The Library , n.s. 26 [1946], 272-294), which effectively argued that the A-text represents a so-called 'bad quarto,' that is to say a memorial reconstruction of some acting version contrived without direct reference to any manuscript in the authorial line. Because of the paraphrases of this A-version in the anonymous Taming of a Shrew (1594) and an apparent reference in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1600-1601) to a scene in the B-text not present in the A-text (combined with what Kirschbaum took to be internal cross-references in A to episodes present only in B), Kirschbaum concluded that the A-text was a memorial reconstruction of the B-text as we know it from the 1616 quarto and hence that neither text contained the Rowley-Birde additions. Sir Walter Greg had been working on parallel lines, but he could not have escaped being seriously influenced by Kirschbaum's conclusions, which he made the basis for the extraordinarily intricate and detailed reconstruction of the history of both texts in the introduction to his parallel-text edition of Doctor Faustus in 1950. It was peculiarly unfortunate that Kirschbaum felt the demonstration of the memorial nature of the A-text by necessity involved the hypothesis that it was a redaction of the whole of the present B-text so that one in effect proved the other. It was also unfortunate that this linkage was accepted although not without question by Greg so that it became an article of faith: one could scarcely believe that the A1 edition was a bad quarto unless one simultaneously assumed that it derived memorially from the present B-text without the additions. 1 The two problems are in fact independent; and where the evidence appears to overlap in certain comic scenes, the hypothesis of B-text revision as part of the 1602 additions is as satisfactory as A-text memorial corruption and shortening where this evidence concerns the identifiable revisions. In the opinion of the present writer Kirschbaum's argument needs re-examination, and a more scrupulous examination of the problem (removed from the question of the A-text as bad quarto) will suggest that the A-text — if it is a report as seems most probable — refers back to the original version of the play whereas the B-text of 1616 contains not only the 1602 Rowley-Birde additions but also their revisions, chiefly confined to the comic middle part of the play, conventionally assigned as Acts III and IV, but also affecting the tragic action in Act V. 2 Five parallel passages are commonly accepted as borrowings from Faustus in the anonymous Taming of A Shrew entered in the Stationers' Register on 2 May 1594 and often considered to be itself a bad quarto of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew instead of a source of that play. Two of these passages echo lines in which the A and B-texts agree. 3 One repeats the word from the B-text in a passage where both versions otherwise agree, 4 and one the word from the A-text in similar circumstances. 5 These have no evidential value in respect to the 1602 additions. On the other hand, the fifth case (if legitimate) may echo a passage in a scene of the play where the A-text is wanting and the B-text alone is available. This is A Shrew , IV.ii.60-61, 'This angrie sword should rip thy hatefull chest, | And hewd thee smaller than the Libian sands', generally taken to be derived from Faustus , 1397-98, 'And had you cut my body with your swords, | Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand' (IV.ii). Moreover, although Greg (p. 28) admits that the parallel is not necessarily convincing, he and Kirschbaum agree that it can be strengthened by a reference in The Merry Wives of Windsor , IV.v.67ff. (TLN 2283-87) in Bardolph's speech, 'for so soone as I came beyond Eaton , they threw me off, from behinde one of them, in a slough of myre; and set spurres, and away; like three Germane -divels; three Doctor Faustasses .' This is taken to refer to the same scene, in which Benvolio, Frederick, and Martino are punished by the three devils Asteroth, Belimoth, and Mephistophilis, with especial reference to Martino. Faustus commands, 'Go Belimothe , and take this caitife hence, | And hurle him in some lake of mud and durt' (1408-9), and shortly in Scene xiii (IV.iii) Martino re-enters bewailing that he is 'Halfe smother'd in a Lake of mud and durt, | Through which the Furies drag'd me by the heeles' (1434-35). If the B-text contains the additions of 1602, these two scenes of Benvolio's attempted revenge and its punishment by Faustus must be among them, for they are wanting in the A-text and are intimately bound up, also, with the Emperor Carolus scene and its quite different treatment of the scoffing knight in the A-text. A third piece, one that may be called internal evidence, has also been adduced by Kirschbaum (pp. 285-286) and approved by Greg. In the A-text the Horse-courser, entering wet, cries out, 'he bade me I should ride him into no water; now, I thinking my horse had had some rare Qualitie that he would not have had me knowne of, I like a ventrous youth, rid him into the deepe pond' (Greg, A-text, 1180-83). In the B-text Scene xv (IV.v) which is absent in the A-text, the Horse-courser's narrative in a different context reads, 'Doctor Fauster bad me . . . in any case ride him not into the water. Now sir, I thinking the horse had had some quality that he would not have me know of, what did I but rid him into a great river' (1540-43), whereas the parallel B-text of the incident itself (Scene xiv) as quoted above in the A-text has simply, 'I riding my horse into the water, thinking some hidden mystery had beene in the horse, I had nothing under me but a little straw' (1484-86). Because the language of the A-text seems to repeat that of the B-text in Scene xv wanting in A, not the language of the parallel B-text of Scene xiv, Greg believed that it established the presence of the text of Scene xv when the A-text was memorially reconstructed. On these three pieces of evidence, in the last analysis, rests the whole case for the absence in the B1 quarto of the 1602 additions. It is now my task to re-examine Kirschbaum's and Greg's postulate, deriving from this evidence, that the whole B-text as we have it is a unified one that represents substantially the original composition of the play. The most obvious point of attack are those scenes, or major parts of scenes, that are present in the B-text but wanting in the A-text. These are in order: (1) lines [831-835], 836-980 of Scene viii (III.i) which represent all but the opening of the scene and concern themselves with Faustus' decision to forgo the sights of Rome in favor of disrupting the Pope's feast, the rescue of Bruno, and the exit of the Pope and his train to prepare for the banquet; (2) Scenes xii-xiii (IV.ii,iii), lines 1324.2-1456.1, comprising Benvolio's revenge and Faustus' retaliation; 6 (3) Scene xv (IV.v), lines 1504.2-1557.1, the meeting of the clowns in the tavern with the conclusion of this episode in lines 1588.1-1668 of expanded Scene xvi (IV.vi) where they interrupt Faustus' exhibition of his art to the Duke of Vanholt and his lady and are humiliated; (4) the start of Scene xviii (V.ii), lines 1796.2-1819, in which Lucifer, Belzebub, and Mephostophilis exult over Faustus' imminent doom and Wagner thanks Faustus for the bequests in his will; and (5) lines 1879.1-1925 later in the scene, Mephostophilis' confession that it was he who tempted Faustus, followed by the visions of heaven and of hell under the direction of the Good and Bad Angels. 7 In Greg's view (pp. 23-29) these are all A-text subtractions from the B-text original, not B's additions to the A-form of the text. 8 Nevertheless, the evidence for at least some of this material points in the contrary direction. The first of these scenes, in Rome, illustrates with superior clarity the case for addition and revision. Both the A-text and the B-text prefix Scene viii (III.i) with Chorus 2 (753.2-778.1) — the A-text, however, omitting 760-772, 774 — which recounts Faustus' eight days' trip through the heavens and then, on a second trip 'to prove Cosmography ', introduces him as first arriving in Rome in order to take part in St. Peter's feast that is being celebrated on this day. Both texts then continue with Faustus' account of his travels through France and Italy, and then his question where they now are, followed by Mephostophilis' reply and his description of Rome. Both then agree in Faustus' impatience to see the sights of Rome and in Mephostophilis' advice to remain in the papal palace to 'take some part of holy Peters feast.' At this point the two texts diverge. The A-text continues, normally, with Faustus' acquiescence to the plan and with his request to be made invisible. The Pope then enters to the feast, which Faustus and Mephostophilis disrupt, ending with the Dirge and the beating out of the Friars. This is a unified scene that follows the details of the source Historie of the Damnable Life . On the other hand, the B-text at the point of divergence very oddly repeats in expanded form the last two lines of the Chorus but for the sole purpose of changing the situation by yoking the annual feast of Peter with 'the Popes triumphant victory', which we later learn has been the defeat of the Emperor's forces and the capture of Saxon Bruno. After a boast about his life of pleasure, Faustus recounts once more the eight days' journey through the heavens already covered in the Chorus and then begs Mephostophilis to be allowed to stay in order to take part in the ceremonies. Since this was what Mephostophilis had originally suggested, he agrees, and then ensues the episode of Saxon Bruno and his rescue, subsequently given a special transition to the feast, at which point the two texts converge in their action. This material unique in the B-text cannot be a subtraction in the A-text, for all the evidence points towards its addition by a reviser in B. The abruptly altered purpose of the feast, different from the Historie , in order to insert material about Saxon Bruno from Foxe's Book of Martyrs is sufficient demonstration, with the confusion that results from this change and the resulting awkward join. Indeed, if more evidence were needed, it comes in 840-853, a complete non sequitur as a preface to Faustus' unnecessary plea to be allowed to stay, for the repetition of Chorus material suggests, as does the repetition in 833, that the writer envisaged the excision of the Chorus and was awkwardly providing within the scene itself the same information about the setting that had been the reason for the Chorus' existence. To reverse the situation by arguing for the A-text as a memorial redaction of B is quite impossible, for it would mean creating unity out of a thoroughly mixed-up situation. 9 Stylistic evidence confirms addition and revision. The reviser of this scene was free with rhyming couplets whereas none had appeared earlier in the play; moreover, couplets have no place in the original opening of the scene. Liberal use of rhyme, indeed, sets off the work of this particular reviser, as well as his occasional practice of completing a part line with the opening line of the next speech, a convention only sparingly used, if at all, in the original manuscript. 10 This partiality for couplets, it must be emphasized, is no part of the play where the A-text is present: couplets occur only in certain of the scenes, or parts of scenes, in which the B-text is the sole authority. Thus they constitute the best stylistic test available to isolate the work of this reviser, for they are unique to him. Scene xii (IV.ii), 1324.2-1430.4, contains at least fourteen rhyming couplets, and Scene xiii (IV.iii), 1430.5-1456.1, in its short length has nine. These two linked scenes found only in B depict the attempted revenge of Benvolio and the punishment Faustus gives to Benvolio, Frederick, and Martino. Little doubt can exist that these two scenes are the work of the author of the additions and revisions in Scene viii and hence that they participate in the additions made to the B-text. Scene xii has one completed line between speeches, and Scene xiii has four. The elaboration of the material here away from the simple dramatization of the Historie in the A-text of Scene xi is obvious, and the same difficulty exists here as with Scene viii in accepting the A-text as a memorial reconstruction. That is, the A-text knows nothing of the elaborate byplay marking Scene xi between Benvolio and his friends, or between Benvolio and Faustus, that associates this new material with revised Scene viii through the introduction of Saxon Bruno, and that leads to the revenge and its punishment. Although the exhibition of Alexander to Carolus is recalled in its salient details, the reporter of the A-text would need to have suffered a complete blackout when it came to the extensive comic material that is interwoven in Scene xi, so complete indeed that not a single detail was remembered and he was forced to return to the Historie to rebuild in an elementary and quite different action the lost original. This is not a hypothesis that lends itself to ready belief when the stylistic evidence as well as the evidence for elaboration, not for subtraction, associates this extensive section with the additions in Scene viii. In Scene xviii (V.ii) the opening triumph of Lucifer, 1796.2-1819, has only one couplet (1811-12) but two completions of part lines. By common consent it stands out stylistically from what follows in the scene, it is wanting in the A-text, and thus it can be assigned with some confidence to the revision of the original play. In corroboration, a faulty join of the new material is revealed by the repetition in its brief interlude between Faustus and Wagner of information given in Wagner's soliloquy (present in both texts and therefore part of the original) beginning Scene xvii (V.i), a repetition reminiscent of the same overlapping of old and new material in Scene viii. 11 Finally, 1879.1-1925, another set piece later in Scene xviii, with its visions of heaven and of hell distinguishes itself from the surrounding action by containing at least ten couplets and two completed part lines. It is unknown to the A-text 12 and stylistically associates itself with the similar cases earlier of B-text additions. The two crucial allied facts are that these noted scenes are unique to the B-text and, simultaneously, share distinctive stylistic characteristics not found elsewhere in the B-text (or in the A-text). The double association is critically significant in setting these scenes apart from the rest of the material that can be assigned as part of the original manuscript on the grounds that it is shared by both the A-and the B-texts. These scenes distinctive to the B-text are important in the comic action of Acts III and IV but they also touch up the tragic last scene. It now remains to examine the only other scene unique in the B-text, Scene xv (IV.v), 1504.2-1557.1, which instead is a part of the farcical action, with its conclusion in 1588.1-1668 attached to the comic action of Scene xvi (IV.vi). In these two prose sections involving the clowns' drinking bout and their interruption of the magic show at Vanholt, the touchstone of couplets and completed lines cannot be applied, and little can be done to associate the language with that in the verse scenes by the couplet writer. 13 General probability, then, constitutes the argument. That is, all other scenes unique in the B-text can be isolated as distinctive additions set apart from the style and matter of the original manuscript as shown by the agreement of the two texts; hence some special circumstance would need to be present to justify any hypothesis that, alone of all the scenes wanting in the A-text, the tavern action in Scene xv and the aftermath at Vanholt in Scene xvi were omitted in A1 because of total memorial failure or the exigencies of provincial production. 14 Two small hints may, instead, suggest that these sections are also additions, presumably by the same reviser(s) who supplied the other unique B-scenes. In the first place, the original scene at Vanholt— although it exhausted its source in the Historie insofar as the Historie account could be dramatized 15 — was brief and relatively undramatic, especially after the more extensive Carolus episode presented in the original play (as reconstructed by the A-text). Since in the Carolus episode the reviser chose to expand the action of the magic-show by an extensive and completely original reworking of the Historie's account of the knight and his horns (reproduced from the Historie with some faithfulness in the A-text), it may be suggested that he would have felt even more keenly the need to piece out the spare and static magic business at Vanholt by similar extraneous material. In contrast to the Carolus scene where the Historie and the original version of the play suggested the action to elaborate, the Historie was of no use for the additions to Vanholt and the grapes. It may be conjectured, therefore, that with some ingenuity the reviser chose to extend the Horse-courser action beyond its conclusion both in the Historie and in the A-text original. He took hints about the eating of the hay and a very bare account of the charming of some yokels from the Historie and combined these with a narrative recapitulation of the Horse-courser's theft of Faustus' leg that brought it to a new conclusion in the jokes about Faustus' wooden leg and the eventual revelation that Faustus was sound in both limbs. It will be observed that this hypothesis for the addition of the farcical scene in the tavern, with its transferred recapitulation of the Horse-courser's adventure with Faustus, answers Kirschbaum's and Greg's postulate (described above, earlier) according to which the A-text (1180-83 in Greg's numbering) in the original scene echoes language not of the parallel B-text but instead of the B-text recapitulation in the tavern scene, wanting in A, and hence provides evidence that this tavern scene had been present in the original manuscript where it affected the A-text memorial reconstruction of the earlier scene. Instead, if one hypothesizes the addition of the tavern episode, one may reasonably associate with this a corresponding revision in the earlier scene of the B-text Horse-courser's account of his adventure since it was to be repeated in the later tavern narratives of Faustus' mischiefmaking. Thus one need only take it that the supposed echo in A-text's Scene xiv (IV.iv) of B-text's Scene xv (IV.v), 1540-43, in fact represents no more than A's version of the original scene before its revision and hence before the B reviser's transfer of the fuller account in Scene xiv to the new Scene xv (with the corresponding reduction in B Scene xiv of the original details preserved in A). The narrative in Scene xv is thereby made no more repetitious than is effective in the retelling of a good joke, and the more precise detail transferred to the tavern scene leads naturally to the concluding jest of Faustus' wooden leg in expanded Scene xvi, which requires the tavern narrative as its motivation. 16 No technical objection on the evidence of the A-text can be made, therefore, to the hypothesis that these two farcical actions should be joined to the comic additions (and to the additions to and revision of the tragic action in V.ii) as material distinctive to the B-text not present in the manuscript from which the memorial reconstruction of the A-text derived. The view that the scenes unique to the B-text represent the Rowley-Birde additions of 1602 has been objected to on the ground that these are not extensive enough to warrant the payment of £4, close to the price for a new play. 17 At this distance it is difficult to adjudicate the merits of such a payment, which presumably would be based more on the intrinsic importance of the new material for reviving the popularity of an old play than on mere length. If the number of editions of the B-text (six between 1616 and 1631) is any guide to its popularity on the stage — and editions may sometimes coincide with revivals — Rowley and Birde earned their money. It is possible, however, that they earned it more thoroughly than is usually supposed. That is, the question of less identifiable revision as well as of the readily isolated new additions must be raised. 18 That there was revision of Scene xiv as a consequence of the addition of Scene xv has been suggested above, with some evidence in its favor. The new material that expanded Scene xi at the Emperor's court as preparation for the added scenes xii and xiii has also been mentioned as a revision of the A-text's elementary (or original) treatment of the scoffing knight dramatized from the Historie . Although these two cases of revision were required by the additions that followed, it is possible that other scenes were worked over in consideration of the £4 payment. In this connection it may be no accident that the B-text's Scenes vii (II.iii) and x (III.ii) substitute Dick as Robin's companion for the A-text's Rafe of the combined scenes from A and that Dick is the name in the only other appearances of this character in added Scene xv (IV.v) and expanded Scene xvi (IV.vi). This association leads to the conjecture that it was the reviser who split apart the unified A-text scene numbered by Greg as viii and ix although very likely it would be considered as one scene owing to the immediate re-entrance at A-text 985 of Robin and Rafe with the goblet in substantially a continuous action. 19 If so, he would be likely to rework the dialogue and not content himself merely with renaming the characters. 20 The reviser seems to have left the first farcical scene — between Wagner and Robin — more or less alone, for the A-text here is closer to the B-text than in any other farcical action. If so, this scene is the only trustworthy indicator among the farcical episodes of something like the true quality of the A-text memorial reconstruction of such material, the B-text's reviser having interfered in the rest to affect the evidence. Since one result of the reviser's observed ministrations was the overlapping or the awkwardness of his joins to original material as in the beginning of the scene at Rome and in the bequest to Wagner, 21 other such difficulties may reveal his hand. One of these is the very odd presentation of two magic books to Faustus, the first by Mephistophilis in Scene v (II.i), 543-551, and the second by Lucifer in Scene vi (II.ii), 717-720, in both cases Faustus' thanks being cast in identical words. It is just possible that the reviser was working over the Seven Deadly Sins action and then, moving back, excised the weak prose continuation of the presentation of the first book (almost certainly an interpolation between two Marlovian sets of speeches 22 ) and brought the scene to a close, in preparation for Scene vi, by repeating Faustus' thanks to Lucifer now applied to Mephistophilis. But this possibility is offered here with many reservations, for the matter is extremely obscure and an alternative speculation is almost as plausible. 23 Other anomalies in the play may refer back to the reviser. Some modern editors have found that the exhibition of Helen to the Scholars in Scene xvii (V.i) is inferior on the whole in the B-text to the A-text version. 24 In the same scene, moreover, the first speech of the Old Man is so completely different in both versions as to go beyond memorial corruption in the A-text and to require actual rewriting in one or the other form of the play. Similarly, it is perplexing whether the A-text's omission of the Scholars' discovery of Faustus' body represents Marlowe's original ending and a later production cut, or whether the B-text conclusion is a subsequent addition. As for the last, the terror of the great soliloquy provides a most effective ending, but there is something to be said for the traditional close of a tragedy in peace that is furnished by the Scholars' comments (Scene xix, 1982.3-2001.1). In favor of considering these closing lines as of a piece with the other passages unique to the B-text is the possibility that the final Chorus provides the assimilation of experience and commentary that is usually contained within the last lines of the action, as in the Scholars' comments, and indeed is repetitious if these comments are present. Yet opinions might well differ as to the effectiveness of either end and it is not beyond belief that at this point the acting version of the A-text could indeed have made a production cut. On the other hand, the lines themselves do not bear the unmistakable mark of Marlowe's hand (although he could have written them) and they would not seem to be beyond the capacities of the writer of the revised Old Man's first speech in the B-text. 25 The Scottish verdict of 'not proven' is perhaps the only one possible on the evidence, although in my own view we should have more pertinent evidence before assigning to Marlowe any such separate passage unique to the B-text where it automatically comes under suspicion of joining the other unique passages in the B-text that are the work of Rowley-Birde. For the rest of the possible tinkerings in the tragic action, one may say only that since the hand of the reviser has been seen in V.ii with some certainty, there is no bar to his also having worked over parts of V.i, specifically the sight of Helen and the Old Man's first speech. The alterations made in the B-text at a later time than the formation of the A-text are not confined, then, to the additions, important as these are, but also include revision and expansion of comic and farcical scenes already in existence as well as some reworking of the tragic action in Act V. That these alterations are on the whole extensive enough to be identified with the additions by Rowley-Birde for which £4 were paid in 1602 is the proposition I wish to advance. They cannot be identified with anything else, certainly. Indeed, the characteristics of the verse in the additions to Scene viii in Rome, with special reference to the extensive use of adjectives in - al to end verse lines, 26 are so similar to Samuel Rowley's When You See Me You Know Me , printed in 1605, as to have led Greg (pp. 133-136) to conjecture that Rowley (and perhaps even Birde) was the original collaborator with Marlowe. 27 This is the reviser whose penchant for couplets in scenes unique with the B-text sets him apart from any of the remaining scenes that by their presence both in A1 and B1 may be thought of as original, whether or not by Marlowe. The question at last arises whether the evidence herein adduced for the special characteristics that set apart the unique B-scenes and the expansions of other scenes, together with the revision, all of which points irresistibly to the Rowley-Birde additions of 1602, is strong enough to stand against the three pieces of contrary evidence — from The Taming of A Shrew , from The Merry Wives of Windsor , and from the supposed memorial echoes in the A-text of unique B-scenes. The 'echoes' can be discarded immediately on the ground that they are as reasonably to be assigned to revisions in the B-text as to memorial recollection in the A-text. The suggestion that A Shrew , IV.ii.60-61, 'This angrie sword should rip thy hatefull chest, | And hewd thee smaller than the Libian sands' is a paraphrase of Faustus , 1387-98, 'And had you cut my body with your swords, | Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand' in the unique B-scene xii (IV.ii) is, in Greg's words (p. 28), 'one of the least convincing of the parallels, and cannot be taken by itself to prove anything at all.' But Greg continues, 'It is, however, supported by a curious point relating to another of the scenes peculiar to B,' and he describes the allusion in The Merry Wives of Windsor to the punishment of Benvolio, Frederick, and Martino, and approves of the authenticity of this latter reference. He concludes, 'Since, then, The Merry Wives was probably written in 1600 to 1601, it follows that the scene in question was at any rate no part of the Rowley-Birde additions of November 1602.' Although not so positive as Kirschbaum and Greg of the precise application of this reference to the B-text's Scenes xii-xiii, 28 I am not prepared to deny it out of hand; but even if it were to be accepted — and this is not altogether certain — the conclusion does not follow by necessity that the Rowley-Birde additions are automatically disproved. Although The Merry Wives was probably composed about 1600-1601, the text we have comes to us from the Folio of 1623, printed from a transcript by Ralph Crane of the promptbook current at that date. A bad-quarto text registered on 18 January 1602 (almost a year before the payment to Rowley and Birde) and published in the same year may offer only doubtful testimony about the form of the original play but at least it does not preserve the allusion. A number of anomalies in the Folio text, including the change of Ford's alias from Brooke to Broome, and a clearcut rewriting of parts of the fifth act, constitute a warning that the Folio text cannot be relied on in all its details to provide us with an exact copy of the 1600-1601 text. The differences between the Folio and the bad quarto in the matter of the Germans, moreover, suggest some caution in assigning to 1600-1 anything to do with this puzzling German material in its Folio form. In general, the Folio material seems to allude to Frederick Count of Mömpelgart's attempts first to be honored with the Garter and then to secure its insignia. In 1592 and 1595 he or his representatives had some obscure trouble about the purchase of horses that excited considerable comment. He was elected, finally, in 1597 but despite protests in 1599 and an embassy in 1600 he did not receive the insignia until November 1603 under James. The possibility holds, therefore, that the allusion to Faustus , whether or not specifically to B-text's Scene xiii, was a part of the rewriting that produced the altered Folio text as we have it, just possibly for the court performance of November 1604 when the award of the insignia was a year old and the joke was less touchy and more reminiscent. In the midst of these uncertainties about the exact form of the Shakespeare text, therefore, no one can say for sure that the allusion to Faustus was present in The Merry Wives on its initial writing in 1600-1, given the known facts that suggest Folio alterations in the play. Under these circumstances, in my view, the keystone evidence that demonstrated for Greg the impossibility of Rowley-Birde's additions being present in the B-text of Faustus is too uncertain, and even suspect, to bear the major weight of excluding these additions. Greg's interpretation is contrary to the general run of probability 29 and also contrary to the specific evidence for the distinctive quality as well as the unity of the added B-text material, the evidence that it does not always fit smoothly into the original context, and the generally accepted relation of its style to that of Samuel Rowley. Once the additions and revisions herein isolated are accepted as the 1602 reworking, Greg's extreme complexity of hypothesis is materially simplified, for analysis shows that almost every one of his arching conjectures that pile problematic speculation on speculation refers ultimately back to the difficulties he faced in arguing for Kirschbaum's postulate that the B-text could not contain the Rowley-Birde additions largely because of the allusion in The Merry Wives of Windsor . Instead, we have a relatively simple case with no necessity for the various expedients that — among others — give us Marlowe's reworking the play in its promptbook to explain why the A-text sometimes seems more authentic than the B-text 1602 revisions, or Greg's acceptance (pp. 95, 132) of Bullen's suggestion (made at a time when the memorial nature of the A-text was not understood) that the passages peculiar to B in Act V 'are original drafts discarded in the final make-up for performance.' I suggest that Kirschbaum's premise was faulty because it denied the 1602 additions in the B-text. Hence when Greg accepted the premise without sufficient scrutiny, his supremely logical intellect was channeled into constructing the complex series of hypotheses, each one more speculative, that seemed necessary to solve the massive difficulties of what was, in fact, an essentially unnatural problem. Once the narrowness and the ambiguity of the evidence behind Kirschbaum's premise is recognized, the simpler logic of accepting the 1602 additions as present in the B-text reduces the problem of Doctor Faustus to relatively manageable terms. 30 The numerous textual problems are not automatically solved by this hypothesis, but various of them are materially clarified; and except for the contamination of the manuscript text from the 1613 quarto and the ministrations of the editor-inscriber of the 1616 copy we now know pretty well where we stand. The critical shift in our view of the play that will result from the exclusion of the unique B-text material and the return to the identification of the A-text as representing the form of the original play even though in a memorially corrupted text, should also clarify the position of Doctor Faustus in the history of the drama.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It is true that one of the more substantial pieces of evidence in favor of memorial transmission involves what appears to be knowledge in the A-text of episodes in the B-text either not used in A or else so materially altered as to represent quite independent treatment in A. If the view of this evidence is reversed and the references become not debased memorial recollection in A of the present scenes in B but instead B-text revisions, as I propose to argue, the case for A1 as a bad quarto is weakened but not, I am strongly inclined to think, destroyed. Greg himself had his moments of concern about various discrepancies in this evidence and in its direction when he contemplated seriously as an alternative the possibility: perhaps revision unknown to the A-reporter had been made in the manuscript underlying the B-text on the occasion of the conjectured purchase of a Pembroke's men promptbook in 1593 for the acting of the play by the Admiral's company in the autumn of 1594. In the end, however, he decided (pp. 95-97) that the weight of the evidence was not sufficiently in favor of such revision to warrant the complexities of hypothesis that would follow, and thus he decided to 'proceed on the assumption that the B-text is substantially of one date, and represents the play as drafted in the autumn of 1592.' 2 Thomas Bushell, the publisher of the 1604 quarto, entered for his copy on 7 January 1601, almost two years before the payment on 22 November 1602 to Rowley and Birde. It is a reasonable conjecture that the copy used for entrance did not differ from that in the 1604 quarto, whether or not lost editions intervened between 1601 and 1604. That is, although it might be theoretically possible for Bushell between 1602 and 1604 to have acquired a redaction of the A-text containing the additions that differed from the original copy he had entered, the consequences of this line of speculation are scarcely to be contemplated: it would follow either (a) Bushell purchased a memorial text in 1601 and then a second memorial text after 1602; or (b) Bushell purchased a good text in 1601 but published a different shortened and debased text, still without the additions, in 1604. 3 A Shrew , II.i.79-80, 'To seeke for strange and new-found pretious stones, | And dive into the Sea to gather pearle' from Faustus , 109-112, 'I'le have them flie to India for gold; | Ransacke the Ocean for Orient Pearle, | And search all corners of the new-found-world | For pleasant fruites, and Princely delicates' (I.i). (All quotations from Faustus and line-numbers are from my edition of Marlowe [Cambridge University Press, 1973].) Second, A Shrew , III.vi. 31-32, 'As once did Orpheus with his harmony, | And ravishing sound of his melodious Harpe' from Faustus , 579-581, 'And hath not he that built the walles of Thebes | With ravishing sound of his melodious Harpe, | Made musicke with my Mephistophilis ?' (II.ii). 4 A Shrew , Induction,i.9-12, 'Now that the gloomie shadow of the night | Longing to view Orions drisling lookes | Leapes from th' antarticke world unto the skie | And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath', which is identical with Faustus 229-232 (I. iii) except that the A-text has 'earth' where A Shrew and the B-text read 'night'. 5 A Shrew , II.ii.1-4, 'Boy. Come hither, sirrha, boy. | Sander . Boy, oh disgrace to my person, sowns, boy of your face, you have many boies with such pickadevantes, I am sure'. Here the Faustus A-text, though departing slightly in other respects, reads the key word 'pickadevaunts' whereas the closer B-text (probably by the ministration of the inscriber or editor) reads 'beards.' A-text, ' Wag. Sirra boy, come hither. | Clo. How, boy? swowns boy, I hope you have seene ma-|ny boyes with such pickadevaunts as I have. Boy quotha?'; B-text, 343-345, ' Wagner . Come hither sirra boy. | Robin. Boy? O disgrace to my person: Zounds, boy in your face, you have seene many boyes with such beards I am sure' (I.iv). 6 With these must almost certainly be associated lines 1154.2-1203.1, the beginning of Scene xi (IV.i), which introduce Martino, Frederick, and Benvolio and detail the preparations for the entrance of the Emperor with Faustus, and no doubt lines 1316-1320, Benvolio's threats at the conclusion of the scene which prepare for the action of Scenes xii-xiii. 7 The variations in the Old Man's lines are also in question, as is the Scholars' discovery of Faustus' body, and will be considered later. 8 Greg's reasoning in this matter is almost wholly directed by his feeling that additions of this nature and extent would necessarily represent the Rowley-Birde additions, which he is unwilling to admit. He is well aware of the difficulties of his position but believes that he is choosing the lesser of two evils. Similarly, although tempted by the hypothesis for some revision in 1594, he does not concede that the weight of the evidence justifies any departure from his general position that the B-text throughout is unified and was prepared only from the original foul papers, any revision in these being confined substantially to Marlowe's second thoughts made in the promptbook itself as represented by the A-text report. 9 From the presence in the B-text of seemingly original lines 760-772, 774, missing from the A-text Chorus, we know that this Chorus was available in the manuscript and was not an A-text invention. The curious anomaly in B 845-846 sounds almost as if it were Mephostophilis who had been suggesting a trip through Rome and it was Faustus, not Mephostophilis, who was urging participation in the feast before seeing the sights. Some slight possibility may exist that the reviser proposed to cut or alter part of the A-text beginning the scene, as well as the Chorus, but if so it is clear that the particular original manuscript from which the B-text inscriber was working had not been adjusted to correspond with the reviser's papers. There is no dispute between the two texts, however, that the initial arrival in the Pope's palace was merely to have a pied à terre , and the decision to participate in the feast before sightseeing — no matter who proposed it — followed as a consequence. 10 See 868 in this scene and references below. A completed line of this sort indicated earlier in the Cambridge text at 595 may be authentic or accidental. The tendency, though more marked in the work of this reviser than in the original, is not a prominent one, however: see 889-890 and 901-902 for opportunities that he passed over. 11 Just possibly the reviser proposed to excise Wagner's original soliloquy as the devils carry in the banquet (1674-80) since it is not essential to the action at this point, although closer to the Historie than the revision. The new position has the virtue of associating Wagner's farewell with that of the Scholars and thus of concentrating the material. 12 That the visions of heaven and of hell require elaborate stage properties has been taken as evidence that these lines were omitted in the A-text although present in the original manuscript. This might provide an acceptable reason were it not that it does not apply to 1880-91 within the action — Mephostophilis' exultation over Faustus — nor to the following dialogue in 1892-1898 between the Good and Bad Angels. Moreover, if the exigencies of provincial performance had prevented a descent of the throne, only minor adjustment in the Good Angel's lines 1899-1908 would be necessary to do without it, and not much more in the Bad Angel's description of the torments in hell and his farewell (1909-25) that follows just before the clock strikes eleven and Marlowe's own great final soliloquy begins. However, once the stylistic link of the couplets and the completed part lines is made with the other sections of the play unique with the B-text, the too easy rationalization of the A-text omissions here as stemming from provincial performance loses its pertinence. 13 However, the two farcical scenes are by the same writer, whether or not he was the author of the other additions. One cannot be an addition and the other a fragment of the original version omitted in the A-text. 14 Total memorial failure is not a convincing explanation given the acceptable memorial reconstruction of other farcical scenes such as the initial one between Wagner and Robin or the Horse-courser episode, or the conjuring of Robin and Dick. As for cutting for provincial performance, one may reasonably enquire why one of the better farcical episodes would be selected for omission in both its parts. 15 The Historie recounted the magical erection of a castle in the air and a tour through it by the participants in the adventure, an episode that would seem to defy staging and is therefore only mentioned at the start of the scene. Thereafter the Historie furnished only the relatively thin action of the grapes. 16 Another A-text 'echo' is perhaps even clearer as, instead, part of the B-text's transfer of original A-text material to the new Scene xv. The slightly unusual word 'Hostry' (or 'Ostry') is first found in B-text's Scene vii (II.iii), 733, in Robin's warning to Dick not to interfere with his conjuring, although missing in the memorially transmitted combined A-text version of this scene coming later. In the B-text it is next used in Scene xv, 1552, in the Horse-courser's narrative in the tavern. Here the word seems to have been taken over by the reviser from the A-text of Scene xiv (Greg, Scene xi, lines 1214-15) when the Horse-courser promises Mephostophilis forty more dollars to release him after he has pulled off Faustus' leg: 'come to my Oastrie, and Ile give them you.' It is interesting that a discrepancy appears between Scenes xiv and xv that involves this word. In Scene xv the Horse-courser boasts of Faustus' leg: 'now 'tis at home in mine Hostry' (this the phrase taken over from the A-text lines 1214-15) although in the B-text Scene xiv he proposed in his escape 'to cast this leg into some ditch or other'. The A-text does not mention the fate of the leg; thus it is as possible that the casting into a ditch is a carelessness on the part of the B-reviser as it is a lapse in the memorial report of the A-text. However, on the evidence of the use of 'Hostry' in the B-text Scene xv borrowed from the A-text of Scene xiv, Mephistophilis was present in the original Scene xiv, as in the A-text, and it was the reviser who removed him although forgetting to delete his name from the opening stage-direction. This appears to be the true explanation for his presence in the direction, not contamination from the A-text affecting a careless editor-inscriber of Scene xiv from the original manuscript. 17 Allied to this, in some part, is Greg's objection that if the unique B-scenes are removed, thus taking away much of the substance of the comic action of Acts III and IV, he does not see that very much is left of the original play. This objection is overstated. The A-text Acts III and IV still hold the three essential comic actions at Rome, at the Emperor's court, and at Vanholt, plus the farcical Horse-courser scene and, combined, the farcical scenes of Robin's theft of Faustus' magic book, the affair of the silver goblet, and the conjuring of Mephostophilis. If due account is taken of the normal reduction in the length of memorially reported scenes, something of a reasonable acting version of about 2,000 lines would result. 18 What follows is more speculative than the case that has been presented for the identification of the 1602 additions and should not be taken as in any sense affecting the virtue of the argument for these. 19 This speculation reverses Greg who takes it that the re-entrance is not really continuous action but a clumsy expedient of the A-text memorial reconstruction which had united, or rather associated, the two independent scenes in the original as represented by the B-text. Not much faith can be placed in Greg's surely desperate guess that the two scenes in the A-text may have been alternatives. 20 A similar splitting of the continuous action of an A-scene, presumably by the reviser, occurs when the Horse-courser episode is staged as an independent scene in the B-text (this Scene xiv suggested as reworked) whereas in the A-text it was continuous with the Emperor Carolus scene. 21 These duplications or awkwardnesses suggest, as has been remarked in Scene viii at Rome, that he had written out his revisions and additions independently and that the B-text was set from his original papers, a conjecture perhaps assisted by the theatrical nature of his stage-directions in contrast to the non-theatrical nature of directions in the B-text set from the earlier manuscript in places where it had not been retouched save perhaps by the inscriber. In Scene viii he definitely does not seem to have reworked the basic manuscript to fit in his new material. Whatever the nature of the manuscripts available to the inscriber of the final copy sent to the printer of the 1616 quarto (and he may not have reinscribed the reviser's new and worked-over scenes but only the papers of the original manuscript that were seemingly in less clean form), it was clearly not the prompt-book. 22 Mephistophilis' preliminary to the offer of the book, in what is almost certainly a Marlovian passage, begins with 'Marriage is but a ceremoniall toy' and ends 'Ready to execute what thou commands' (535-549). The interpolation in the A-text (whether by the original collaborator or by actors' gag) follows in prose in which Faustus requests further books but Mephostophilis shows that all the information he wants is in the one he has presented. Then in the A-text without interruption, but in the B-text after Faustus' thanks and in a new scene, Marlowe's part resumes with 'When I behold the heavens then I repent.' 23 That is, it would be possible to argue that the revision of Mephistophilis' presentation of the book might be laid to the editor (or inscriber) who found that the prose continuation of lines 551.1-13 was not present in his manuscript (and thus would represent unauthoritative A-text expansion) and being at a loss how to close the scene he replaced the lines by the thanks to Lucifer from the next scene. Either speculation is not without its problems, however. Although the A-text transition without scene division is certainly abrupt and may represent some difficulty in the original play, yet a continuous action is not impossible. On the other hand, the start of a new scene in the B-text violates the stage-convention that characters who have just left the stage empty should not immediately re-enter unless the action is to be taken as continuous. It may be that the B-text's direction to Scene vi — ' Enter Faustus in his Study, and Mephostophilis' — was supposed to indicate the passage of time by a difference in locale; nevertheless, it is interesting that someone saw the need for a transition and ineptly inserted the short form of the Chorus 2. Perhaps a new Chorus was intended but was not written or else was lost and the A-text's stage production merely continued the scene. Yet if the basic manuscript the inscriber was consulting for the B-text did not contain the A-text's form of continuation, how did it end the scene; or did it, in turn, continue like the A-text and it was the editor-inscriber who marked the end of one scene and the start of another? 24 Greg is forced to assume that the B-text represents the version in Marlowe's foul papers which he reworked in the promptbook and thus that his own revision comes down to us in the A-text; but such authorial reworking in the prompt copy itself is unusual and an unnecessarily complex hypothesis. Moreover, in my view this part of the scene is not Marlowe's. The language associates it with his collaborator. 25 Greg is inclined to accept the lines as Marlowe's (p. 127). In support one may mention the merest gossamer of evidence in the phrase used at 1993 by the Third Scholar, 'At which selfe time the house seem'd all on fire,' a somewhat uncommon idiom that parallels 'Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd, | In one selfe place', 510-511, lines that are indubitably Marlowe's. Yet against this evidence could be placed the phrase 'the Doctor' in 1987, 'Pray heaven the Doctor have escapt the danger', a form of reference characteristic exclusively of the added scenes in the B-text, as in lines 1183, 1222, 1294, 1553, 1557, 1658. 26 Cf. in Scene viii 'State Pontificall', 870; 'Statutes Decretall', 883; 'authority Apostolicall', 923; 'blessing Apostolicall', 973; and in Scene xi, 'state Majesticall', 1233. 27 These pronounced Rowleyan characteristics, including a predilection for couplet writing, are confined to the unique B-scenes; hence the presence of Rowley cannot properly be argued for in the original collaboration. As for Birde, no identified specimen of his writing has been preserved. He collaborated with Rowley in a lost play called Judas late in 1601. 28 Little parallelism exists between the forcible abduction by the three devils of Benvolio, Frederick, and Martino, with the particular punishment of being dragged through the mud meted out to Martino, and the escape of the Germans from Bardolph. His entrance bemired may be only a sight-gag, and the association of the three Germans with the three devils of Scene xii may be fortuitous. The heart of the allusion lies in the speed with which the three Germans escaped as if they were supernatural beings, or three magical Doctor Faustuses. The reference to the magic-making of Doctor Faustus is clear enough, but not necessarily an allusion to this specific scene. Indeed, if a choice had to be made, I should prefer the supposed paraphrase in A Shrew as the more convincing, conventional as it may be with the act of mincing someone's body, or with the quite ordinary use of 'sands' for number as in Dido , III.i. 87-88, 'where Ile offer up | As many kisses as the Sea hath sands,' a parallel scarcely to be confined to Marlowe, of course. 29 The case certainly cannot be demonstrated, but it would be an oddity for Wright to go to the expense in 1616 of securing a new and improved text of Faustus for a revised edition and then to accept one that did not contain the Rowley-Birde additions that should have retained a prominent part in the new look given the old play and would have been current on the stage, or at least in the memory of various purchasers, in 1616. It is at least worthy of notice that although the 1616 titlepage (which was clearly set under the influence of the quarto of 1611) perhaps inadvertently did not mention the new text, Wright's next edition of 1619 advertised 'With new Additions.' In my view the delay has no significance. Similar advertisements in other dramatic quartos (when they are not false) usually refer to revisions; hence the evidential value of the 1619 titlepage as bearing on the Rowley-Birde question cannot be ignored. It is quite possible to argue that the impetus for the publication of a new text of the play in 1616 was the opportunity that had arisen for Wright to secure these 1602 revisions. 30 That is, as manageable as any bad-quarto problem can be with a line of transmission that has contaminated the good text.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Dating Through Calligraphy: The Example of "Dover Beach" by S. O. A. Ullmann</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dating manuscripts can be puzzling. Although it is sometimes possible to assign dates on the basis of references in the text to specific historical or biographical events, all too frequently there are no such clues or those that exist lead to dating within a period of only five, ten, or more years. Generally this is unsatisfactory, especially for an edition of letters or for dating the poems of a writer like Matthew Arnold, who composed most of his poetry within a decade and who published his three most important volumes of poetry within five years. To deal adequately with such a writer's development precise dates for manuscripts are essential. Calligraphy has long been used to assign anonymous manuscripts to their historical period and to determine whether a manuscript was written during a writer's youth, maturity, or old age. A relatively recent development, however, is the attempt to refine this procedure so that dating within a year or even less becomes possible. Such precision can be achieved because the handwriting of most people, and especially of those creative people who regularly write by hand, is constantly changing. 1 The use of calligraphy to date letters, when combined with references in the text, has enabled scholars to make remarkably precise attributions. For example, a letter may refer to an unspecified death in the family or to the publication of some unnamed work. If the letter can be dated within a year by means of handwriting, it is sometimes possible, on the basis of this internal evidence, to determine the exact date on which the letter was written. Madeline House and Graham Storey, editors of the monumental Pilgrim Edition of Dickens' letters, have found that calligraphy can sometimes even enable them to correct Dickens' own misdatings, not uncommon especially at the beginning of a new year. 2 Two independent investigations using calligraphy to date manuscripts of nineteenth-century writers reveal important similarities in method: the first, an analysis of the handwriting of Emily Dickinson from 1850-86; 3 the second, the edition of Dickens' letters already referred to, which makes great use of calligraphy, especially in the first volume where more than two-thirds of the letters were originally undated (I, xxiii). These two studies, together with the present one, use individual letters of the alphabet as the basic unit of analysis. All three studies also usually differentiate among examples of the same letter, depending upon their position at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. Although Dickens' editors found that his signature and a few common words and names were especially useful for dating, they tended to concentrate on the initial or final letters of these words and names. A number of variables complicate the task of comparing samples of calligraphy. Manuscripts written with a pencil differ from those written with a pen. Even a change in pen or pen point affects the calligraphy. Health, mood, and fatigue likewise influence handwriting, as does the purpose for which the manuscript was written. The calligraphy of a formal letter or a fair copy of a poem will normally differ from that used in dashing off a note to a friend or writing a first draft. No wonder many believe it impossible to use handwriting as a basis for precise dating. These variables, however, merely make the task of analyzing calligraphy difficult, not impossible. Although comparisons among homogeneous manuscripts naturally produce the most reliable results, valid comparisons are possible among heterogeneous materials. Careful examination of dated samples will reveal the nature of the difference between fair copies and rough drafts. A single letter written informally but containing a long quotation, normally written more carefully, can enable one to observe the differences. Mrs. Ward found, for example, that Emily Dickinson's calligraphy in her late work sheets is a throwback to the handwriting she used earlier in fair copies (I, l-li). For Matthew Arnold, on the other hand, the reverse is true. Fair copies are PLATES Text of ["Dover Beach"] Plate I 1 The sea is calm tonight. 2 The tide is full; the moon lies fair on the French coast 3 Upon the Straits: [the cliffs of deleted ] the light 4 Shines &amp; is gone: the cliffs of England 5 Glimmering &amp; vast: out in the tranquil bay. sweet 6 Come to the window, hush'd is the night air. 7 Only from the long line of spray 8 Where the sea meets the moon blanch'd sand 9 Listen, you hear the grating roar, 10 Of pebbles which the waves suck back &amp; fling bank'd 11 At their return, up the steep strand again 12 Cease and begin and then begin mournful 13 With regular cadence [s deleted ?]low, and bring 14 The eternal note of sadness in 15 Sophocles long ago 16 Heard it on the Ægean, and it brought 17 In to his mind the turbid ebb and flow 18 Of human misery: we 19 Find also in the sound a thought 20 Hearing it by this distant Northern Sea 21 The Sea of Faith 22 Was once too at the full and round Earth's shore 23 Lay like the folds of a bright garment furl'd: 24 But now I only hear 25 Its melancholy long withdrawing roar 26 Retreating to the breath 27 Of the night wind down the vast edges drear 28 And naked shingles of the world— Ah love [l deleted ] &amp;c regressive in their calligraphy; while his rough drafts are innovative and reveal the direction in which his handwriting is developing. Analysis of different types of dated samples will reveal what kind of allowance needs to be made when comparing heterogeneous documents. The apparent chronological difference between a fair copy and a rough draft by Arnold is about a year. Fortunately, a few tell-tale signs always reveal that his fair copies are of later date than most of their features would otherwise lead one to suppose. Precision in dating is of course partly a function of the amount of dated material available. Without at least three thousand words a year in dated manuscripts accurate results will be difficult to obtain. Each manuscript can best be analyzed on a separate sheet of ruled paper on which one or more lines is provided for each letter of the alphabet and for any commonly used symbols, such as the "&amp;." Theoretically every occurrence of every letter should be traced on this sheet, using a lighted box with a glass top. Because transcribing even a single manuscript in this way would be extremely time-consuming, one makes many shortcuts in practice. To make them intelligently, prior study of the calligraphy is essential. Some letters, perhaps the "i's" and "o's," vary little from year to year. Other letters appear too infrequently to be useful, for example, capital "Q," "K," "X," "V," and "Z." Medial letters, except for distinctive combinations such as the "dg" of "Dover Beach," can normally be eliminated, thus saving considerable time. They generally show less variation from year to year than initial or final letters, and of course they are affected by both the letter that precedes and the one that follows them. An examination of medial "d," "f," "g," "h," "p" and "y" in hundreds of pages of Arnold manuscripts yielded little that was helpful for dating. After deciding which letters and symbols to analyze, one can duplicate a number of lined forms with the appropriate letters indicated in the left-hand margin. Some blank lines should be left for later additions. Often it is not only easier but also more useful to subdivide the examples of an individual letter into categories. Once these have been identified, it is enough to trace one example of each type and then simply note how often each occurs. For a single manuscript a handful of categories for any one letter should be adequate. Finer distinctions are unnecessary if, through preliminary examination, one has chosen categories that represent the significant variables. Obviously judgment based upon experience is necessary in deciding how many different variables to use and which letters to analyze. For example, one of Arnold's letters selected for analysis in the "Dover Beach" manuscript was his initial "n." At first only the beginning of the letter seemed important. Was the stroke vertical or horizontal, did it hook or loop, was it large or small? Later it became apparent that the angle between the first major downstroke and the next upstroke was highly significant. After years during which the upstroke largely retraced the downstroke, Arnold began to spread the letter so that it came to have two arches instead of one. Although a letter may vary from document to document and from year to year, it sometimes varies in a random way and is therefore useless as a clue to dating and can be dropped from further analysis. Arnold's final "y's" are extremely variable, but the variations depend more upon his mood and his purpose than upon the date. In Arnold, initial letters are the most revealing, but for other writers final letters are the most significant. Capital letters are always more useful than their relative rarity would lead one to suppose. Once a representative group of documents has been transcribed, the sheets should be studied carefully letter by letter to discover which provide clues to dating. One will then be in a better position to proceed more selectively in transcribing the remaining manuscripts. In examining the letter "s," for example, one would like to find variant "s 1 " occurring in 1850, "s 2 " in 1851, and "s 3 " in 1852. Unfortunately this never occurs. What is more likely is that "s 1 " and "s 2 " will both appear in 1850, though perhaps with "s 1 " dominant. By 1851 the proportions may be reversed with, in addition, an occasional "s 3 ." By 1852 "s 3 " may have become dominant and "s 1 " may have almost disappeared. Even this sequence is far too simple as a description. More than three major variants normally appear simultaneously, and changes rarely begin on New Year's Day. Within a period of months a writer may drastically alter the way he forms a letter and then may make no change in it for years. Yet although few letters retain their importance for dating throughout a writer's career, in any given year some of the letters—initial "s," capital "L," final "g," for example—will differ significantly from those of the year before. These, then, become the major indicators for determining whether a manuscript was written during that year. Thus Mrs. Ward lists for each year the distinctive features of Emily Dickinson's handwriting (I, li-lix). Although it sometimes happens that a variant will disappear only to reappear some years later, the over-all configuration of the other letters will indicate whether this is the first or second appearance of the variant. In this kind of analysis of calligraphy similarities are much more important than differences. Differences are the norm, similarities the exception. Therefore if every major variant of a single letter in an undated manuscript has its counterpart in the dated manuscripts of a given year, one has a clue to the dating. If all the letters of the manuscript fall into categories occurring within that year, the date of the document is established. Despite the fact that each individual letter is unique in some small way, if a manuscript is to be convincingly assigned to a particular year, the pattern of all its letters must be appropriate to the categories for that year, and unusual variants must be of a kind that are at least possible for that date. For instance, if the staff of a letter in successive years formed an angle of 30°, 60°, and 90° with the horizontal, a staff at an angle of 40° could easily be dated by its place in the sequence, even though no other examples of a staff at this angle existed in dated documents. Because patterns for all the letters, surprisingly, do fit in this way, it is usually possible to date manuscripts with a high degree of confidence. Because my interest in calligraphy grew out of a need as editor to date the many separate sheets of poems, notes, and reflections that constitute what is usually referred to as Arnold's "Yale Manuscript," I have naturally selected an Arnold manuscript, that of "Dover Beach," to illustrate the procedure described above. "Dover Beach" was an obvious choice, not only because it is Arnold's most famous poem, but also because it is the only one of his three or four best poems that survives in manuscript, now in the Ashley Collection of the British Museum. Moreover, ever since Tinker and Lowry first described the manuscript in 1935, 4 its dating has been a subject of increasing controversy. Warren Anderson speaks for many students of Arnold's poetry when he says of the poem: "Unique in its fame, it is also uniquely difficult to date." 5 Even with the aid of handwriting, it presents more than the usual number of problems, and is probably the most difficult to date of the more than a hundred individual Arnold manuscripts that I have dated. This draft of the poem is in pencil, most of it very faint, so faint in fact that Tinker and Lowry remark: "The lines have been so rubbed as to be almost illegible; indeed, it is even possible that an effort was made to erase them after they had been copied." 6 This cautious supposition, however, is mistaken. Arnold's usual practice, as illustrated in Plate I, was to draw lines through rough drafts of a poem, if he did not destroy them altogether, once the work had been published. Copies of published poems that survive without these disfigurements are usually fair copies (sometimes those used by the printer) that Arnold presented to friends or members of his family. The "Dover Beach" manuscript shows no erasures of the kind one would expect if Arnold had tried to obliterate the poem. Although Plate I is more legible than the original, it has been reduced by about 16% and is still difficult to read for those unfamiliar with Arnold's handwriting. A transcript has been provided, for no accurate text of the manuscript is available in print. Occasionally it is difficult to be certain of the punctuation. The untitled manuscript contains only the first twenty-eight lines of the poem and ends, "Ah love &amp;c" (after "love" there are very faint remains of an "l," indicating that Arnold started to write the next word, "let," but decided to stop and add "&amp;c"). The poem is on the front (the back is blank) of the second of two separate sheets that at one time were folded vertically and horizontally (see Plate I) and inserted into Thomas J. Wise's copy of the first edition of Arnold's Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems , now in the possession of the British Museum. At the top of the second sheet are the last seven lines of Arnold's notes in ink for "Empedocles on Etna," taken from the second volume of Simon Karsten's edition of Philosophorum Graecorum veterum praesertim qui ante Platonem floruerunt operum reliquiae (Amsterdam, 1838), pages 3-78. (All except the first eight and a half lines of Arnold's notes are transcribed by Tinker and Lowry, Commentary , pp. 289-90. There are two errors in their transcription of that part of the notes illustrated in Plate I: "Anchities" (l.2) should be "Anchitus," and "Orpheuslike" (l.6) should be two words, not one.) "Dover Beach" fills the remainder of the page in a way that clearly indicates that it was written after the notes that precede it. In June 1849 Arnold showed "Empedocles on Etna" to J. C. Shairp, a Balliol contemporary. Shairp's comments, in a letter of June 30th to Arthur Hugh Clough, indicate that enough of the poem had been written by then for Shairp to recognize that Arnold seemed to be using Empedocles' "name and outward circumstances" simply "for the drapery of his own thoughts." Because Arnold's notes are the kind he would have made at an early stage in his work on the poem, they cannot date from later than the spring of 1849. A letter from his mother to his brother Tom indicates that early that year Arnold still intended to write his long-contemplated tragedy, Lucretius , but he must soon thereafter have decided to incorporate some of the work for it into "Empedocles on Etna." In an outline of his poetic plans for 1849 ("Yale Manuscript," fol. 25 r ), probably jotted down in the fall of 1848, Arnold includes both "chew Lucretius" and, under the heading "compose," "Empedocles—refusal of limitation by the religious sentiment." It seems probable, then, that the notes on Karsten date from early in 1849. (An analysis of the handwriting of these notes, a relatively easy manuscript to date, places them between mid-1848 and mid-1849, thus supporting the usual date based upon the evidence given above.) The draft of "Dover Beach" must, therefore, have been written between early 1849, when Arnold made the notes on Karsten, and July 1867, when the poem was published in Arnold's collection of New Poems . One scholar has placed the date as early as September 1848-October 1849, 7 and another, as late almost as the day of publication, 8 though a majority consider the early fifties the most likely period of composition. 9 Hardly anyone who has dealt at length with the poem has been able to avoid confronting the question of its date. Arguments have been based on its connection with the notes for "Empedocles on Etna" and the likely interval between the notes and the poem; 10 and on Arnold family tradition connecting it with Arnold's wife, the possibility that it refers to Arnold's visit to Dover on his honeymoon in June (and again in October) 1851, and the likely interval between the event and the poem. 11 Other critics arrive at a date based upon the work's poetic maturity or upon its similarity in theme, imagery, and outlook to one or more of Arnold's other poems, especially "Human Life" and "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse," though there is disagreement about whether its composition preceded or followed the latter. 12 Some critics date the poem on the basis of Arnold's debt to the work of other poets, for example, to Browning's "Andrea del Sarto" of 1855. 13 Others find the poem indebted to Clough's The Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich , 14 while, on the contrary, still another critic sees Clough's "Say Not the Struggle Naught Availeth" (written by October 1849) as an answer to Arnold's poem (Robertson, pp. 919-26). If the poem was, in fact, written late in 1848, Professor Kenneth Allott ought to have placed it 30th in his chronologically arranged edition of the poems. On the other hand, if it was written early in 1867, it should be numbered 121 of the 129 poems Arnold published during his lifetime. In other words, settling the date of the poem involves deciding whether it was composed at the outset of Arnold's career as a poet, near its close, or somewhere between these extremes. Arnold's calligraphy provides a reliable basis for settling the problem, or at least for limiting its scope. Ideally this study ought to present numerous examples of Arnold's handwriting arranged chronologically along with the sheets of analysis based upon them, but this has not proven feasible. Instead, Plate II 15 contains primarily a selection from the "Dover Beach" manuscript of variants sufficiently rare that they appear within only a limited period, usually no more than a year or two. Virtually all the available letters, diaries, and poems for the years 1849-55 have been drawn upon for comparison. 16 Manuscripts for other years were eliminated because they had too little in common with the handwriting of "Dover Beach." Where the similarity between a dated variant and one in "Dover Beach" is sufficiently close, a "+" has been entered on the chart along with the month of the matching document. Personal judgment, of course, cannot be eliminated from the process of deciding whether the similarity is "sufficiently close." Matching requires enough familiarity with Arnold's handwriting for one to recognize unusual formations. Sometimes the special features that account for the rarity of an individual letter are small (as in the "L" illustrated in Plate II), while at other times they are large and obvious (as in S 1 ). In addition to relatively rare forms, Plate II includes examples of initial "s" and "w" labelled "norm." These represent categories that include more than half of each of these initial letters in the "Dover Beach" manuscript. These categories are in the majority in at least one document for each of the years marked with a "+." Arnold used these categories throughout the 1849-55 period, but only in the years indicated were they ever the norm, as they are in "Dover Beach." Because these two forms involve categories, precise matching is not required. Something needs to be said as well about the great majority of letters not illustrated in Plate II. Analysis of the "Dover Beach" manuscript began with an attempt to find matches for all of the capital letters and for about twelve lower-case letters—in all, almost sixty categories. Elimination of both the unique and the commonplace led to the selection reproduced in Plate II. Most of the letters in the manuscript proved to be of almost no significance for dating because they can be readily matched in documents throughout the 1849-55 period. A few letters are genuinely unique, unmatched in any other document, for example the "S" in line 21, as well as the "Th" formation beginning the same line (perhaps the result of Arnold's changing his mind as he was writing the word). There are at least eight unique variants in these twenty-eight lines, an unusually large number, appropriate for so original a poem. In style, content, and handwriting, its originality consists of small but significant variations on familiar patterns. The following brief comments point out the most important features of the individual letters and combinations illustrated in Plate II. (All lower-case examples are of initial letters, except for the "dg" combination, which occupies a medial position, and the "ds" combination, a terminal position.) 1. d (l.27): the major downstroke is at least slightly convex, and there is no loop at the top of the letter. 2. dg (l.27): the vertical of the "d" descends in a curve to form the vertical of the "g." There are small loops at both top and bottom of the combination. 3. ds (l.23): the "s" is rounded and extends slightly below the base of the "d." 4. G (l.5): the top of the letter is comparatively small, and the first part of the stroke (the upper lip) is on a line with the major downstroke. The main axis of the letter slants forward less than 30° from the vertical. 5. L (l.9): the top has a rounded hook to the left and shows no tendency to loop. At the base of the letter the top of the loop is to the left of the vertical and has a major vertical axis, with the downstroke reaching its low point after crossing the major downstroke. 6. n (l.6): the initial stroke forms a rounded hook (the apparent full loop is the result of a smudge). The major upstroke diverges at an angle of approximately 45° from the base of the initial downstroke and reaches a pointed peak. 7a. S 1a (l.3): loops at top and bottom with a forward slant. 7b. S 1b (l.20): loop at bottom only with a forward slant. (In 1851 the initial upstroke is too short.) 8. S 2 (l.4): hook with rounded bottom. (In 1853 the hook is too narrow and in 1855 too broad.) 9. s 1 (l.1): the lower-case version of S 1a . 10. s 2 (l.14): a very slight overlap or loop at the top with a rounded hook at the bottom that just begins to circle back on itself. 11. s 3 (ll.7, 8 twice, 10, 11 twice, 22, 28): the lower-case version of S 2 . 12. Th (l.14): a wide hook with a slight tendency to loop at the start. The "T" is linked to the "h" rather high up. 13. W (l.22): the initial downstroke slants less than 45°. The final upstroke makes an angle of about 60° with the vertical. (The "line" about mid-way down the initial stroke is a blemish in the paper.) 14. w (ll. 10 twice, 18, 25, 28): both halves of the letter are at least slightly rounded. The left side of the letter is at least two-thirds the width of the right side. The period from January 1851 through April 1852 includes examples of all the formations illustrated in Plate II. Because the letters not illustrated are commonplace throughout the period and because the eight unique exceptions mentioned above, though not found in any other manuscript, are variants of a kind that one would expect to find at the time (see p. 27), it seems reasonable to suppose that the manuscript was written during this fifteen-month period. This conclusion is of course based upon the total configuration of the calligraphy and not merely upon the letters illustrated in Plate II. Although dating depends upon finding similarities, a date cannot be established unless it is possible to account for all the forms in a manuscript. It is not enough that some forms can be matched in contemporary manuscripts. One must be able to demonstrate the possibility of all of the forms occurring within the assigned period. One very useful clue to dating Arnold's handwriting not illustrated in Plate II is the lower-case "th" combination, in whatever position it occurs. During the late forties Arnold often formed this combination without lifting his pen or pencil to make the crossbar of the "t." On average during the late forties every fourth "th" is formed in this way. In 1850 there are some manuscripts without this formation. From 1851 on, it disappears almost completely. In the last lines of Arnold's notes on Karsten, which precede "Dover Beach" (see Plate I), there are three examples of the uncrossed "th," appropriate for the period 1848-49. The formation does not occur at all in "Dover Beach," lending support to a date after 1849 and probably after 1850. There are combinations and variants that do not appear and disappear quite so dramatically. The proportions within the major categories of initial "f," for example, reinforce the conclusions reached on the basis of the examples illustrated in Plate II. As additional dated manuscripts become available, it should be possible to date "Dover Beach" with greater precision, though it is highly unlikely that the manuscript will be assigned to a date outside the 1851-52 limits. If a computer were to be used, refinements would be possible, even though the results would still depend upon the judgment of a human analyst. An additional piece of evidence, based in part upon handwriting, reinforces the 1851-52 date. Arnold pencilled the following sentence at the top of the recto of the first leaf containing the notes based on Karsten: "Man has an impulse for happiness: he sees something of it, hears traditions of much of it: he thinks therefore he ought to have it: what is true is, he may have it if he can ." From their location, squeezed into the top margin, it is obvious that these words also were written after the notes for "Empedocles." As Tinker and Lowry point out, the sentence is, "plainly, related" to one of the cancelled stanzas from "Empedocles" in the "Yale Manuscript" ( Commentary , p. 290n.), and obviously must have preceded the composition of the stanza. The cancelled stanzas can be dated, on the basis of calligraphy, between February 1851 and February 1852. Thus it is probable that the sentence was written in 1851. Because both the sentence and "Dover Beach" are in pencil, they are relatively easy to compare. Although the sample is too brief to be dated definitely, the handwriting shows many marked resemblances to that of "Dover Beach." If one accepts 1851 as the date for the sentence, '"Dover Beach" must fall within the 1850-52 limits, since the resemblance is too marked for them to have been written more than a year apart. If instead of focusing on the calligraphy one looks at the manuscript as a whole, still more clues to its dating emerge. Almost everyone who has commented on it has pointed out that the final words, "Ah love &amp;c," seem to suggest that the last nine lines of the published poem were composed before the first twenty-eight. The implication is that Arnold wrote the first twenty-eight to lead up to a conclusion that he had already arrived at. Although Tinker and Lowry point to the absence of any reference to the sea or tides in the conclusion ( Commentary , p. 175), few readers consider the poem flawed structurally. In fact, Professor Dwight Culler, far from believing that the poem strains to link two diverse sections, considers the absence of the sea in the last lines "the very point of the poem." 17 After my work on the calligraphy of the manuscript had been completed, Professor L. A. Beaurline suggested that the manuscript is very likely an "intermediate draft" of the poem and that there must have been an earlier version of the entire poem, not simply of the last nine lines. He based his hypothesis upon two observations: the revision of line 3, which suggests an eye-skip to line 4, and the absence of revisions in lines 15-28, which contain only one verbal variant from the final text. Careful examination of the manuscript supports this hypothesis. When Arnold was copying the second half of line 3, his eye may have strayed to the second half of line 4, as Professor Beaurline suggests; or he may have been relying upon his memory and have momentarily forgotten the sequence of clauses. It is also possible that he may have decided to insert a clause that did not appear in the earlier draft. In line 4 the manuscript omits the verb "stand," which appears in the published versions. Though "England" may seem to satisfy the need for a word to rhyme with "sand" and "strand," it does so by producing a feminine ending, the only one in the poem. Arnold again almost certainly copied his first draft hurriedly and inaccurately, or relied upon a faulty memory of his earlier draft. The manuscript also seems to suggest that Arnold revised line 12 by adding the word "again," but the meaning of the sentence would have been incomplete without it. Arnold probably began to put the word at the end of the line and then recalled that in his earlier draft he had inverted the normal word order for the sake of the rhyme, if for no other reason. We, of course, cannot determine in how many ways this version improved upon the previous one. Despite the absence of internal revisions in twenty-three of the twenty-eight lines, the pencilled draft is obviously not a fair copy. Though the poem seems to be squeezed on the page and Arnold has left no room for the final nine lines, he uses the space well. Except for the first few lines, the first two sections of the poem are so evenly spaced that Arnold must have known how many lines he had to fit on the page. Although the third stanza is written across the side of the page and may seem to be an afterthought, it gives the clearest proof that Arnold knew before he began this section how many lines he needed to make room for. If the third section had been only six lines long, like the second section, he could have begun it further to the right and then the text would have been interrupted only by line 10. But he began exactly where he had to in order to fit in eight evenly-spaced lines. Still, one wonders why Arnold didn't write the final nine lines on the back of the sheet, since it is blank. Perhaps he was satisfied with the last section and intended to use a fresh sheet for a fair copy in ink. Between completing the British Museum draft and preparing a fair copy for the printer some time before 1867, six verbal changes and numerous alterations in punctuation and capitalization were yet to be made. If the manuscript is an intermediate draft of the poem, perhaps produced by copying a previous draft or, more likely, by revising it at least in part from memory, it is unlikely that much time elapsed between the two versions. Arnold could hardly have relied upon his memory after a lapse of more than a month or two, and a few days or less seems a more likely interval. If the earlier draft were no longer fresh in his mind, he would probably have copied it more carefully than he did and would not have relied upon his memory. The dating by calligraphy suggests strongly that, to the extent that the poem reflects events in Arnold's life, the woman in the poem must be his wife. Since the first draft apparently included not only "the darkling plain" but also the references to the moonlit scene at Dover, it is unlikely that the poem was conceived before late June 1851, when according to Arnold's unpublished diary he and his bride first visited Dover together (Allott, Poems , p. 240). Arnold of course need not have written the first draft at Dover. The scene may well have been recollected in tranquility, perhaps late that summer or after a second brief stopover at Dover, October 8, 1851, reviving earlier memories, or during the Christmas season, with the first few discouraging months of school inspecting (October-December) behind him. If, then, one combines biographical evidence with clues furnished by the manuscript in general and calligraphy in particular, a reasonable date for the British Museum draft of the poem is between late June 1851 and April 1852. 18</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos by Alan E. Craven</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although much has been learned in recent years about the First Folio compositors and the quality of their work, relatively little is known about the compositors who set the substantive Shakespeare quartos into type, and about the amount and kinds of corruption which these workmen introduced into the quarto editions. One such compositor in the shop of Valentine Simmes is of special interest. For five substantive Shakespeare quartos were printed by Simmes, and these five quartos, as well as substantive texts of quarto plays by other dramatists, were set either wholly or in part by one compositor, Simmes' Compositor A, as he was designated by W. Craig Ferguson: 1 all of Much Ado about Nothing (1600), all of Henry IV, Part 2 (1600), all of the bad quarto of Hamlet (1603), and most of Richard II (1597). In the fifth of these quartos, Richard II (1597), seven of the twelve sheets were printed by Simmes, and these sheets were also set by Compositor A. The work of Simmes' Compositor A can be identified primarily by his highly unusual manner of treating speech-prefixes. After an unabbreviated prefix he characteristically does not use a period. Ferguson noted that of 335 unabbreviated speech-prefixes in Q 2 Henry IV 330 are unstopped; 487 of 489 unabbreviated speech-prefixes in Q Much Ado are similarly unstopped. In these two quartos the evidence from the speech-prefixes alone is virtually conclusive. In addition to the numerous unstopped prefixes, Ferguson observed little unnecessary mixing of roman and italic type (roman being used in the text proper and italic in stage directions), regularity in handling both non-exit stage directions (most being centered and these usually beginning with a capital) and exit directions (most being uncentered and most beginning with a lower-case letter), and consistency in spelling variants (that is, classes of variants pervading the entire text and not forming patterns which correspond to bibliographical units). Yet while these characteristics effectively supplement the evidence of the unstopped prefixes, they are not sufficiently distinctive to be used as conclusive evidence for compositor identification in other Simmes' quartos. For these quartos — substantive editions as well as reprints — in which determination of the compositor is not as clear-cut as in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado , additional characteristics of Compositor A must be adduced. Such characteristics can be found in Q 2 Henry IV and Q Much Ado , which may conveniently be considered together. Although the work of Compositor A does not reveal habitual spellings for a large number of high-frequency words, a few clear ones do emerge, along with less-marked preferences. 2 Henry IV Much Ado heart 29 heart 38 hart 2 hart 1 yong 23 yong 9 young 0 young 2 yoong 1 tongue 18 tongue 16 tong 0 tong 0 eie 10 eie 17 eye 0 eye 4 -nesse (suffix) 35 -nesse (suffix) 28 -nes 11 -nes 7 here 84 here 36 heere 13 heere 15 do 86 do 76 doe 25 doe 28 go 40 go 35 goe 11 goe 19 bloud 22 bloud 8 blood 11 blood 6 Habitual spellings are apparent for a few words: heart , yong , tongue . For most of the other words, moreover, one variant is preferred, although less strongly, by nearly the same proportion in both quartos— do , for instance, being favored over doe roughly 3 to 1. While a definite preference for heart should be apparent in other texts by Compositor A, one would not necessarily expect to find a 3:1 preference for do ; a heavy preference for doe , however, would be surprising. The cumulative evidence of a number of such weaker preferences can often be useful in compositor identification, although for such words the compositor, lacking a clear preference, may be more affected by copy spellings. On many occasions Compositor A chooses not to capitalize certain words that one might expect to be capitalized. He sets both ile and Ile : in 2 Henry IV , ile is preferred 18 times to 14; in Much Ado , ile is used on 21 occasions and Ile not at all. (Excluded from consideration here and below are all forms appearing at the beginning of a verse line or a sentence.) A similar indifference to capitalization of some words can be seen in the treatment of certain titles. 2 Henry IV Much Ado King 57 King 1 king 1 king 0 Prince 9 Prince 25 prince 43 prince 43 Lord(ship) 61 Lord(ship) 37 lord(ship) 79 lord(ship) 38 Lady 1 Lady 36 lady 2 lady 32 Knight 14 Signior 12 knight 3 signior 25 Captain 6 Count(y) 24 captain 12 count(y) 2 other titles, upper case 19 other titles, upper case 2 other titles, lower case 9 other titles, lower case 0 Only for King , Knight , and Count ( y ) are the upper-case forms consistently preferred. Another spelling trait evident in Compositor A's work is the occasional use of long, ee forms of certain pronouns: hee , shee , mee , wee . Although greatly preferring the shorter forms, he sets in 2 Henry IV ee forms 31 times (28 in prose passages) and in Much Ado 61 times (57 in prose); apparently the long forms are used to aid in justifying prose lines. He also habitually uses the ee spelling, without an apostrophe, in contractions such as weele and shees . Although quite clear, the evidence of spelling preferences, like that of the stage directions, is only corroborative; the unstopped speech-prefixes alone are sufficient to identify the hand of Compositor A in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . Similarly, the bad quarto of Hamlet (1603), clearly the work of a single workman, may also be assigned to Compositor A on the basis of the numerous unstopped speech-prefixes. Of the 163 unabbreviated speech-prefixes in the text, 145 are unstopped. At least one unstopped prefix appears on 42 of the 63 pages. The 18 stopped prefixes, on the other hand, are scattered through the quarto, occurring on 12 different pages, but 9 of these pages also contain at least one unstopped prefix. Non-exit stage directions in Q1 Hamlet are in general handled similarly to those in the two earlier quartos. However, exit directions, although usually set to the right just as they are in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado , sometimes begin with a capital. Only one exit in 2 Henry IV begins with an upper-case letter; only two exits in Much Ado so begin (although in four other cases in Much Ado a centered exit is capitalized). In Hamlet 5 of 40 uncentered exits are capitalized (along with 6 of the 7 exits centered and on a separate line). In Hamlet , however, a striking difference in typography can be noted: proper names (characters and places) in the dialogue are often set in contrasting italic type, a practice never used in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado (in these quartos only a few Latin words in the dialogue being set in italic). But the contrasting italic is not consistently used throughout Hamlet Q1, the ratio of italic to roman proper names being 4 to 1. On 25 pages (out of 63) both italic and roman names occur, and the italic does not form bibliographical patterns which would suggest the presence of an alternate compositor. Spelling preferences in Hamlet Q1 strongly support the ascription of the entire quarto to one workman, Compositor A. heart 33 hart 13 yong 19 young 0 tongue 9 tong 1 eie 8 eye 19 -nesse 23 -nes 10 here 46 heere 12 do 39 doe 35 doo 3 go 17 goe 31 bloud 3 blood 11 Some of the spelling preferences in the earlier quartos can be observed in the same proportions: yong , tongue , - nesse , here ; the heart preference is lower but still strong. For three variant spellings ( eie/eye , go/goe , bloud/blood ) the preference is reversed. Although predominantly in verse, the quarto contains many ee forms of pronouns—102—although almost three times as many short forms occur. Again the use of both lower-and upper-case titles is evident. King 30 king 24 Prince 17 prince 4 Lord 94 lord 58 Lady 7 lady 1 other titles, uc 1 other titles, lc 0 Similarly, both forms of the Ile/ile variant appear, 13 upper-case forms and 10 lower-case forms. But about half the total number of forms contain an apostrophe. (Included in this count are forms which begin a sentence or verse line.) Ile 15 ile 6 I'le 16 i'le 4 Indeed, the use of the apostrophe is three times as heavy in Hamlet as in 2 Henry IV , five times as heavy as in Much Ado . But neither the increased use of the apostrophe nor the italic in the dialogue invalidates the evidence of the speech-prefixes and other compositorial habits. Nor are there groups of spellings that suggest either that Q1 Hamlet was set by two compositors or that the single compositor was not Compositor A. It is impossible to tell whether the unusual features of Q1 Hamlet reflect new compositorial habits developed in the three-year interval after the printing of 2 Henry IV and Much Ado or whether they simply derive from the copy. The two Simmes' quartos of 1597, Richard II Q1 and Richard III Q1, unlike the three quartos just examined, present difficult problems of compositor identification. Richard II , the less difficult of the two, will be considered first. Unlike the three later quartos, Richard II is the work of two compositors, Compositor A and a co-worker who regularly stops unabbreviated speech-prefixes and has been designated Compositor S by Charlton Hinman. 2 Although many pages of Richard II can be assigned to one of the two compositors on the evidence of the unabbreviated speech-prefixes, a number of pages cannot be so assigned. Eight pages have no unabbreviated speech-prefixes at all, nine have at least one unstopped and at least one stopped prefix, and nine more have only one unabbreviated prefix. Fortunately, identification of the compositors of Richard II is greatly aided because evidence from distinctively damaged types can establish the identity of the type-cases from which any particular page was set and thus usually the identity of the compositor who set that page. The unstopped prefixes characteristic of Compositor A occur regularly on pages set from a case which may be designated case x, the stopped prefixes used by Compositor S from a second, case y. 3 When the evidence of speech-prefixes is used in conjunction with that provided by type-cases, it is possible to determine which of the two compositors set a given page. Thus 57½ pages can be assigned to Compositor A and 15½ pages to Compositor S. (Each compositor set part of C2.) In the quarto 234 unabbreviated prefixes are used: 171 unstopped and 16 stopped prefixes occur on A's pages, 2 unstopped and 45 stopped prefixes on S's pages. The other characteristics of Compositor A observable in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado are not, however, useful in compositor determination in Richard II . Compositor S, like Compositor A, does not normally set off names and places in contrasting type. (Twice in Richard II , Compositor A does set a name in contrasting italic, once on each of the first two pages he set, B1 and 2 v .) As for Compositor A's other habits, there is some disparity in the evidence provided by Richard II Q1 and that of the two 1600 quartos. Exit directions in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado almost always begin with a lower-case letter, but in Richard II exit directions on A's pages are always capitalized, as they are on S's pages. It may be that Compositor A's preference for exit directions changed during the three-year interval, or possibly the use of upper-case exits in Richard II is a conscious attempt to imitate the upper-case exits preferred by Compositor S, who set the first sheet of the quarto. Compositor A's inconsistent treatment of exit directions in 1603 Hamlet should, however, be remembered: 11 are capitalized, 36 are not. Additionally, some non-exit stage directions on A's pages of Richard II Q1 are handled differently from those in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . The practice in these plays is to center such directions. In Richard II five such directions on A's pages (as well as two on S's pages) are set to the right, at the ends of dialogue lines. But since the quarto was set by formes from cast-off copy, such placement of stage directions results from a need to compress material slightly to fit it to the limits of the type-page, and no significance can be attached to their occasional location at the ends of lines. If several of Compositor A's normal characteristics do not appear in Q1 Richard II , many of his spelling preferences do. In addition to Compositor A's, Compositor S's spellings for the same words are listed. Compositor A Compositor S heart 29 heart 5 hart 9 hart 10 yong 5 yong 1 young 5 young 0 tongue 15 tongue 4 tong 7 tong 4 eie 18 eie 6 eye 4 eye 2 -nesse 11 -nesse 3 -nes 20 -nes 7 here 38 here 5 heere 16 heere 5 do 47 do 13 doe 12 doe 3 go 26 go 3 goe 2 goe 0 bloud 37 bloud 12 blood 0 blood 0 A comparison of Compositor A's spellings in Q1 Richard II with those in the three quartos already considered reveals few significant differences. The preference for the longer -nesse form in the other quartos is reversed, and the yong/young variants are used equally. But heart and tongue are clearly preferred (although at lower ratios than in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado ), and for several of the less-marked preferences ( eie, here, do ) the ratios correspond generally with those in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . As might be expected, the greatest differences occur between Compositor A's spellings in Richard II and those in Hamlet Q1, the quarto furthest removed from Richard II in time. For four words the variant form favored in Richard II ( eie , -nes , go , bloud ) differs from that favored in Hamlet , but the ratios of preference in Hamlet are low, these not being words for which the compositor has habitual spellings. In spite of the six-year time lapse, there is a general uniformity of spelling preferences. Unfortunately, spelling preferences are of little value in compositor determination in Richard II Q1 because Compositor A's preferences are almost all shared by his co-worker, Compositor S. For only one word do the compositors clearly prefer different variants (Compositor A favoring heart , a form for which he shows consistent preference in all four quartos, and Compositor S less strongly favoring hart ), although for two other words, tongue and here , A prefers one of the variant forms to the other while S for each of the words uses both variants equally. Capitalization is rather more useful in identifying the compositors of Q1 Richard II . The ile form found frequently in the three later quartos never appears on A's pages in Richard II , Ile always being used by both compositors. But the use of lower-case forms for certain titles can frequently be seen in A's work in Richard II , rarely in S's work. Compositor A Compositor S King 85 King 18 king 30 king 2 Prince 5 Prince 3 prince 1 prince 0 Lord 78 Lord 10 lord 7 lord 0 other titles, uc 36 other titles, uc 6 other titles, lc 7 other titles, lc 0 The two appearances of lower-case king by S are, perhaps, occasioned by special uses, appearing in Richard's sardonic reference to king Bullingbroke and in the phrase king of beasts . Additionally, three stage directions on A's pages also contain lower-case titles. Although one would expect few, if any, ee pronoun forms in the entirely verse Richard II , two do occur, both on A's pages. Before proceeding to the fifth of Simmes' quartos, Richard III Q1, it is desirable to examine additional compositorial features of Richard II , not because there can be any doubt about the identity of the compositor who set four fifths of the quarto, but rather to assemble a fuller body of evidence about Compositor A's characteristics in order to aid identification in Richard III , where unstopped prefixes, the salient feature of Compositor A's work, rarely occur. Because they are shared by Compositor S, no use can be made of many of Compositor A's practices in Richard II : sparing use of the apostrophe, heavy use of colons, round brackets to set off many parenthetical expressions, brief catchwords, as well as a number of spellings for words not listed above. Of some usefulness, however, are several peculiarities in handling stage directions. In four instances on A's pages, non-exit stage directions which appear on a separate line are not centered but rather set to the right; Compositor S always centers stage directions which stand on a separate line. A second difference occurs in the handling of stage directions set to the right, at the end of a dialogue line. Compositor S places a round bracket before the only two stage directions so positioned; Compositor A never follows the practice of bracketing a direction in Richard II or the three quartos previously considered. Of more potential usefulness than this negative evidence for Compositor A is his practice of usually setting both exit and non-exit stage directions in from the outer margin of the type-page, not flush right. In the quarto, 14 exit directions occur at the ends of lines; in Compositor S's work one is set flush right, another only slightly in from the margin, but of the 12 on Compositor A's pages, 10 are set in from the margin (most of them some distance) and the remaining two set flush because there is insufficient space to do otherwise. Also set in from the margin in Compositor A's work are the two exit directions placed on separate lines. (Three long exit directions which contain several proper names also are set on separate lines but are handled variously.) Additionally, of the five non-exit stage directions placed at the ends of lines in Compositor A's work, three are set flush with the margin, owing to lack of space, and two are set in. Thus it would appear that whenever possible Compositor A preferred to set both exits and non-exit directions in from the margin of the type-page. The handling of stage directions in the three later quartos is in general agreement. Excluding from consideration all stage directions set flush right when there is insufficient space to do otherwise, in 2 Henry IV 11 exits (both those appearing at the ends of lines and those on separate lines) are set in from the margin, 5 are set flush right; 6 non-exit stage directions are set in, and 2 are set flush right. In Much Ado , 18 exits are set in from the margin, 3 are set flush right; 2 non-exit stage directions are set in, and 1 is set flush right. In Hamlet , 31 exits are set in from the margin, 1 is set flush right; 9 non-exit stage directions are set in, and 2 are set flush right. One final peculiarity of Compositor A can be observed in Richard II Q1 — the use of abbreviated names and titles. Although abbreviations in the dialogue are rare in the three later quartos, Compositor A in Richard II frequently abbreviates names or titles ( Ric : for Richard , B. for Bishop , etc.), even when there is no need to save space; in his 15½ pages of Richard II , Compositor S abbreviates only twice ( Lo. in the dialogue, Ric. in a stage direction), both times in crowded lines. The word most frequently abbreviated by A is Lord (or Lordship ) — 15 times, 12 as Lo : — but only once to save space in a crowded line. Richard III Q1, the fifth of the substantive Shakespeare quartos associated with Simmes, appeared in the same year as Richard II , 1597. Only seven of the twelve sheets (sigs. A-G) came from Simmes' press. These sheets are clearly the work of a single compositor. Not only were they set from a single type-case, as demonstrated by the evidence of distinctively damaged types, but they also exhibit a uniformity of compositorial practices, especially heavy spelling preferences. Identification of the compositor is, unfortunately, rendered difficult by the scarcity of unabbreviated speech-prefixes — only 18 in the 7 sheets. Although no completely satisfactory reason can be found for the small number of unabbreviated prefixes, the scarcity may in part result from the crowding apparent throughout all seven sheets. But whatever the reason, the 18 unabbreviated prefixes (including one prefix as a catch-word) are not consistently treated; 13 are stopped and 5 are unstopped. These data may be interpreted variously. On the one hand, since the use of unstopped prefixes in the printed drama of the period is rare, 4 even a small number of prefixes so treated would suggest the work of Compositor A. Additionally, Compositor S almost never used unstopped prefixes in Q1 Richard II , while Compositor A occasionally did use stopped prefixes. But on the other hand, since Compositor A so often used unstopped prefixes in the four other quartos, the predominance of stopped prefixes seems inexplicable. The evidence of the unstopped prefixes, then, seems inconclusive for identification of the compositor of Q1 Richard III . (Here and hereafter, I mean by Richard III Q1 only the seven Simmes' sheets, not the entire quarto.) The evidence provided by stage directions, however, strongly suggests the hand of Compositor A. Owing to the crowded pages, many non-exit stage directions are set to the right but never enclosed within a round bracket (the practice of Compositor S), unless the stage direction is turned over or under. Although 19 stage directions are set flush right, on every occasion there is insufficient space for the compositor to do otherwise, but on the 7 occasions when there is sufficient room, the stage direction each time is set in from the margin. Omitting from consideration the one long exit direction with proper names, standing on a separate line, 18 exits are also set in from the margin and only one is set flush right. Another peculiarity can be noted in Richard III Q1. Two non-exit stage directions standing on separate lines are set to the right instead of being centered. Four times in Richard II Compositor A set stage directions standing on a separate line in such a position. Spelling preferences are remarkably clear in Richard III , as the following list indicates. heart 28 hart 3 yong 2 young 7 tongue 8 tong 1 eie 17 eye 4 -nesse 8 -nes 17 here 30 heere 3 do 2 doe 60 go 32 goe 0 bloud 30 blood 0 Since Richard II and Richard III were presumably printed within several months of each other in late 1597, one would expect spellings in Richard III , if the compositor who set the quarto is Compositor A, to correspond more closely to Compositor A's spellings in Richard II than to those in the other three quartos — and such is the case. Richard III exhibits strong preferences for heart (not Compositor S's usual spelling, hart ), tongue and here (the latter words ones for which Compositor S used both variant forms equally). Indeed, only with doe is there a reversal of a form preferred by A in Richard II (S also preferring the do variant). In addition to the strong spelling evidence, the tolerance of abbreviations in the dialogue also suggests the hand of Compositor A. The word most often abbreviated in Richard III , as in Richard II , is Lord (or Lordship ); 15 times the abbreviated form appeared on Compositor A's pages in Richard II (12 as Lo :), and it appears 80 times (76 as Lo :) in Richard III , rarely to avoid an excessively long line. Compositor S in Richard II never abbreviated except to save space, and Lo. was his single abbreviation in the dialogue. Although several kinds of evidence support the attribution of Richard III Q1 to Compositor A, one kind points instead to Compositor S — capitalization. Both compositors, it will be remembered, always used Ile in Richard II (although Compositor A frequently used ile in the three later quartos), and Ile invariably appears in Richard III . But in Richard II Compositor A often used lower-case forms of certain titles, while Compositor S almost always capitalized them. In Richard III lower-case forms of these titles never appear; capitalized titles are used for King (60 occurrences), Queene (26), Prince (16), Lord or Lordship (151), Lady (7), and for other titles such as Duke (41). It should be remembered, however, that Compositor A in Richard II , although frequently using lower-case titles, did strongly prefer upper-case ones. A number of other compositorial features in Richard III could be examined. Most of these (for example, the use of numbers, unstopped, as speech-prefixes on 72 occasions) throw no light on the identity of the compositor, but none of them would suggest that the Simmes' compositor who worked on Richard III is not Compositor A. Despite the scarcity of unstopped prefixes and the total absence of lower-case titles, all other evidence strongly supports the attribution of the seven sheets to Compositor A. It should be remembered that in Richard II Q3, 1598, the work of a third Simmes' compositor can be identified, 5 but there is no evidence to suggest that he was the compositor who set Richard III . Since it seems certain that neither this compositor nor Compositor S produced the seven sheets of Q1 Richard III , we must suppose, if the compositor of Richard III was not Compositor A, the existence of yet a fourth workman, one who possessed almost all the traits of Compositor A. Such a supposition seems so unwarranted that, despite evidence less conclusive than that in the other four quartos, we can conclude that Compositor A almost certainly set the seven sheets of Q1 Richard III . It is clear that Simmes' Compositor A must be regarded as a compositor of unusual importance, having set wholly or in part substantive texts of five Shakespeare plays, three of these being texts of highest authority. In addition, the work of this compositor can be found in other substantive texts — A Warning for Fair Women (1599), Dekker's The Shoemakers' Holiday (1600), Marston's The Malcontent (Q1 and Q3, both 1604), Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (1604), and other substantive editions. 6 How accurate a workman, we may ask, was Compositor A? How many corruptions did he introduce into a given text? What kinds of alterations did he make? And in what specific ways did he corrupt his text? Of course, some manifestly corrupt readings can be observed in these quartos, but, given the often superficial proofreading practices of the Elizabethan printing house, to assume that because a passage makes sense it is necessarily sound is to make a dangerous assumption. In what specific ways, then, was the textual integrity of these plays violated? A careful collation of a printed text with the copy from which it was set, whenever such comparison is possible, can provide a fairly reliable gauge of a compositor's fidelity to that copy. Since the hand of Compositor A can be identified in reprints for which we possess the copy, it is possible to determine with some confidence the corruptions, both in number and in kinds, which he introduced into a substantive text. One such reprint appeared in 1598, a second edition of Richard II , set wholly by Compositor A. By collating this reprint with the copy from which it was set — the first quarto of Richard II — we can discover the relative accuracy of Compositor A. There can be little doubt that Richard II Q2 was set throughout by Compositor A. To be sure, there is a lack of consistency in the use of unabbreviated speech-prefixes. In the early sheets of the second quarto, which were set from material that contained many pages regularly showing S's stopped prefixes, Compositor A seems greatly influenced by copy. 7 But when working on pages of Q2 for which he had set the corresponding pages in the copy, he usually retains the unstopped prefixes, additionally expanding abbreviated prefixes to full names on fifteen occasions, a dozen of which are unstopped. When setting a prefix as a catch-word (and since Q2 is not a page-for-page reprint, the catch-words almost never are the same as those in the copy), he generally does not use a stop. In fact, all of the characteristics which were found to be useful in identifying Compositor A in the other quartos are observable in Q2. Of these, spelling evidence deserves brief comment. Compositor A's habitual spellings are strongly present in Q2. For the three words useful in distinguishing the work of A from that of S, the variant spellings preferred in Q2 are A's (the figure in parentheses indicating the number of changes to that particular spelling). heart 45 (12) hart 8 tongue 23 ( 3) tong 7 here 51 (11) heere 12 ( 2) Capitalization also follows the pattern previously encountered in the work of Compositor A. Additionally, the ee spellings of certain pronouns occur often in Q2 — 50 times — as they did in 2 Henry IV, Much Ado , and Hamlet . In short, there is abundant evidence that Compositor A set all of Q2 Richard II . Since Q2 was reprinted directly from Q1, a careful collation of the two will reveal the fidelity of Compositor A to copy-readings — the principle involved being that the alterations he made in setting Q2 from printed copy provide at least a rough index to both the number and kinds of changes (misreadings apart) he was likely to make when setting from the no longer extant manuscript (almost certainly Shakespeare's "foul papers") which served as the copy for the first quarto. Disregarding obvious typographical errors and variants in accidentals (spelling, punctuation, and capitalization), we can examine the substantive changes which Compositor A introduced into the second quarto. For a change to be considered substantive, it usually must affect meaning. But variant forms of some few words, semantically identical, are substantive when they affect the tone of a passage (and often, when in verse, the meter): my/mine or against/ gainst . Although most substantive variants indicate a textual corruption, a compositor's correction of an obvious error in his copy must be regarded as substantive, whether the reading produced is right or wrong. In the following table of variant readings between Q1 and Q2 of Richard II , the first column shows the page and line number in Q1 and the second and third columns give the readings in the two editions. The changes are classified as follows: those affecting a whole word or words ( substitutions , omissions , interpolations , transpositions , and corrections of obvious errors ); those affecting the letters in a word, a single letter omitted or added or two letters transposed ( literals ); those affecting the form of a word, usually for metrical or other "literary" considerations, whether designed to render more formal or more colloquial ( sophistications ). An asterisk denotes a change which produced a manifestly corrupt reading. (See the table of variants compiled by A. W. Pollard, " King Richard II": A New Quarto (1916), pp. 42-46. The present table differs from Pollard's in almost forty instances, the vast majority of these being readings which Pollard neglects to record.)

Corrections I3.5 Yorke Good King Good The collation of the two editions of Richard II yields the following results: 146 substantive variants in the dialogue and 9 in the stage directions for a total of 155 throughout the text. Thus in the 2592 lines of the play — 2756 lines in the Globe edition less the 164-line abdication scene, which did not appear in either of the first two editions — Compositor A made 155 substantive changes of which but 6 are corrections of obvious errors in Q1 (and these, having no authority, are not necessarily right) — an average of one in every 17 lines. More striking than the number of changes, however, is the fact that only 5 changes of the total 155 produced readings that are patently unsatisfactory. Certainly the incidence of error — one change in every 17 lines — is quite high, but not surprisingly so, since it has been evident for some time that Compositor A was especially prone to alter copy-readings. There are extant two issues of the printing of 2 Henry IV in 1600, Qa and Qb, the second of which contains a reissued sheet, necessitated because a scene was omitted by Compositor A in the original setting. When the scene was added, also by A, parts of the text which made up the original sheet (164 lines) had to be reset, the cancelled material serving as copy for the reset passages in Qb. Collation of the original sheet with the corresponding parts of the reissued sheet shows that in the 164 lines Compositor A made 10 substantive changes — 8 in the dialogue and 2 in the stage directions. The 10 substantive variants in 164 lines produce an average of one in every 16½ lines, corresponding closely to the frequency of variants in Q2 of Richard II . 8 We have some reason, then, to believe that the performance in the second quarto is typical of this compositor's work. Since Compositor A made such a large number of substantive changes in Richard II Q2, it is all the more necessary that we know in what specific ways he violated the integrity of his text. Such information will enable us to know, then, not only the amount but also the kinds of corruption that we may expect to find in the substantive editions that he set. Again, the reprint of Richard II can provide a rough index. The 155 substantive changes in the quarto may be classified as follows: Substitutions 63 Omissions 30 Interpolations 14 Literals 25 Transpositions 8 Sophistications 9 Corrections 6 This classification of the substantive variants introduced into Richard II Q2 reveals, first of all, a surprisingly high proportion of verbal substitutions — over one-third of the changes made in the reprint. There are, moreover, fewer changes in literals (changes involving the addition or omission of a single letter or the transposition of two letters in a word) than omissions of a whole word or several words. Such corruptions cannot have resulted generally from misreadings of the copy-text but rather reflect errors of a memorial nature. Compositor A seems characteristically to have taken more material into his head than he could deal with accurately. Thus he frequently substituted one word for another, interpolated or omitted a word. The words thus affected are not usually nouns and verbs, but instead are connectives and qualifiers (conjunctions, prepositions, articles, pronouns, and, less frequently, adjectives and adverbs): that for which , with for in , my for thy , the for my , in for for : all omitted, as omitted, my omitted, the omitted; the interpolated, and interpolated, a interpolated. These changes made in Q2 suggest what a careful examination of all the variant readings in Q2 substantiates — that Compositor A corrupted his text in an especially damaging way. For the corrupted lines almost always make tolerably good sense and seldom, of themselves, reveal that a reading has suffered corruption. Rarely too does self-evident corruption occur in Q2 when nouns and verbs were substituted, omitted, or interpolated: said for speak , drop for fall , sparkles for sparks , smoke for shock , slaughter for slander ; I say omitted, or fall omitted in the phrase the death or fall of Kings ; country's interpolated before slavish yoke , do interpolated before come . Indeed, as the substantive variants between Q1 and Q2 show, only five changes in the total 155 produced readings immediately recognizable as corruptions. Considering the kinds of subtle corruption introduced into the reprint, it is not surprising that editors have been able to discover in the substantive first quarto of Richard II , for example, only a small proportion of the corruptions that undoubtedly lie in seemingly satisfactory passages, and, finding few manifest errors, have generally regarded the first quarto as well printed and providing in the main an unusually reliable text. Yet the many verbal alterations in the second quarto of Richard II suggest that any substantive text set by Compositor A must be regarded as providing a far less satisfactory reproduction of its copy — whatever the nature of that copy may be — than has hitherto been supposed. For if Compositor A were no more accurate in setting from manuscript copy than from printed copy — if, that is, he averaged one verbal change every 17 lines — he would have introduced into his part of Richard II — 4/5 of Q1 — over 125 corruptions of the kind evident in the reprint and into the substantive texts of plays like Much Ado and 2 Henry IV over 165 and 200 such corruptions, respectively, as well as a good many other errors resulting from misreading the autograph copy. 9 Yet information about the number of corruptions which may have been introduced into substantive texts is of little value to editors of Shakespeare unless it can be determined in what specific ways a given text was misrepresented in the printing house. How at least some errors in a substantive text set by Compositor A can be identified and perhaps corrected will be made clear by examining a few passages in one substantive quarto — Q1 of Richard II . Peter Ure, the New Arden editor of Richard II , argues that it is "no longer possible to overlook the evidence for memorial elements in the Quarto and hence the probability that a transcript intervened between it and the foul papers." 10 The evidence advanced to support the theory of the intermediate transcript consists of anticipatory errors which Ure attributes to a transcriber. A compositor — so the argument goes — is unlikely to anticipate a word found ahead of the line he is setting, but a scribe familiar with the text he is copying might do so. But Charlton Hinman, rejecting the intermediate-transcript hypothesis, has recently shown that supposed anticipatory errors in Richard II Q1 may in fact be only recollections by the compositor of lines he has previously read over in pointing his copy. 11 If the copy for Q1 was, then, the foul papers themselves (as both Pollard and Greg believed), many of the memorial errors could well be of printing-house origin. In Q2 of Richard II Compositor A was especially prone to errors of the very kind that Ure attributes to the putative scribe. The majority of the changes Compositor A introduced into the second quarto were memorial in nature, not misreadings of the (printed) copy-text. Although many corruptions were due to recollections of a similar passage elsewhere in the text, others resulted simply from the compositor's inability to keep in his memory the exact wording of a passage as he set it. Harold F. Brooks has suggested that the putative Richard II transcriber's "errors are occasionally comparable with the errors apparently made by the transcriber of Q1 Richard III , and that the two transcribers may in fact have been the same person, perhaps the book-holder." 12 Since Compositor A set 4/5 of Q1 Richard II and over half of Q1 Richard III , it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that many of the errors in the two quartos are similar, not because the texts were transcribed by the same person, but because large parts of both were set into type by a compositor who inexactly remembered and inaccurately reproduced the words in his copy. Most of the alterations made by Compositor A are of a kind that substitutes sensible but non-Shakespearian readings for what stood in the copy. Lacking that copy we shall be unable to identify many of the corruptions that he introduced. Yet, as Ure notes, "in such a play as Richard II . . . disturbance of metre is often a sign that something has gone wrong with the text, since there is good reason to believe that Shakespeare was generally content at this period to write fairly regular verse." 13 In verse an omitted or interpolated word almost always affects meter, as do some verbal substitutions and some other kinds of changes. Thus Compositor A betrays himself with surprising frequency. For if an ear can be said to be tin, then Compositor A had one of lead; in Q2 Richard II a large number of changes resulted in broken meter — 1/3 of the dialogue variants — a fact with important implications for the editor of any play in which Compositor A had a hand. Especially in Richard II , which is entirely in verse, broken meter or a hypermetrical line may provide a clue to a possible corruption of the text. For in Compositor A's work, as we have seen, even a reading that makes tolerably good sense is not necessarily a correct one. An editor provided with specific information about the work of Compositor A will be better able to determine where the substantive text has suffered corruption. He would, presumably, emend at least some of the passages in which the Arden editor suspects memorial contamination by the supposed transcriber. 14 Moreover, a knowledge of the kinds of errors to which Compositor A was prone may also provide a means of recognizing where a seemingly satisfactory passage has been corrupted. Let the three following examples in Q1 Richard II be used to illustrate. Compositor A was especially given to omitting and interpolating words. In setting Q2 he 30 times omitted and 14 times interpolated a word or phrase. An instance of probable interpolation occurs at V.iii. 54-56, where Q1 reads: Fear, and not love, begets his penitence. Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. The reading has never been emended, apparently because the sense is satisfactory — but then so was the sense of 150 of the 155 corrupted passages in Q2. The meter in the second line is faulty, and we have seen how Compositor A's bad ear often betrays his corruptions. The metrical irregularity here effects no useful purpose: lest thy pity prove is curiously flat. Pity (unqualified) seems decidedly more emphatic and better develops the metaphor. In the context of the speech, pity (the quality itself) corresponds better to the emotions (fear, love) mentioned in the preceding lines. In each case an abstract cause (fear, pity) produces metaphorically a specific effect (his penitence, a serpent). On the quarto page, moreover, the word thy occurs eleven times — in such phrases as thy desire , thy presence , thy promise , and thy abundant goodness . The pronoun thy may have intruded into the compositor's memory because of the mistaken assumption that a phrase parallel to his penitence was required. Thus the following emendation may be worth consideration: Forget to pity him, lest pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. We have seen, however, that in Q2 the total number of omissions and interpolations falls far short of the number of verbal substitutions — 63. We should therefore expect that a great many substitutions corrupted readings in the first quarto. One such substitution we may have at V.iii.29-30, where Q1 reads: Aumerle . For ever may my knees grow to the earth, My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth. . . . Modern editions retain the first quarto reading. Although the meter does not here give us a clue to a possibly corrupt line, the phrase my roof is weak and unidiomatic. There is small reason to believe that Shakespeare would so clumsily adapt Psalms cxxxvii. 6: "Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth." 15 Moreover, we can observe in Q2 a number of substitutions of a pronoun for the or the reverse: thy right for the right , thy word for the word , thy correction for the correction , the gage for my gage , and the land for thy land . And it is easy enough to see how the repetition of my in the passage could have caused the substitution. It seems, therefore, that the second line should perhaps be emended to read: My tongue cleave to the roof within my mouth. . . . Another reading which seems to have been corrupted by a verbal substitution occurs at V.ii.41, where Q1 reads: Duchess . Here comes my son Aumerle. The line has never been emended, and yet it is not really satisfactory. The Duchess is certainly not at this point implying to her husband that Aumerle is her son but not York's. (Historically, the Duchess of York was Aumerle's stepmother, but Shakespeare treats her as his mother.) What seems to be wanted here is surely our son . This very kind of substitution can be observed in Compositor A's work in Q2: my brother for thy brother , your cousin for our cousin , my sovereign for thy sovereign , my last for thy last , thy own for thine own , mine honor's for my honor's , and others of the same sort. For one of this compositor's most characteristic failings was the substitution of a pronoun for another word. It is easy to understand why the substitution occurred. The next speech by the Duchess begins, Welcome , my son . . . . We can be reasonably confident, therefore, that in the earlier line Compositor A has committed an anticipatory error which caused him to substitute my for our and that the line should accordingly read: Duchess . Here comes our son Aumerle. A number of other readings in Richard II that are suspect in much the same way might also be offered to suggest how an intimate knowledge of the characteristic practices of Compositor A can reveal where the substantive text has suffered corruption. Such a knowledge can also provide means of recognizing compositorial corruption in other substantive texts in which Compositor A had a hand. For the textual integrity of the quarto plays set wholly or in part by this compositor was unquestionably affected by his errors — errors especially of careless omission and verbal substitution which resulted in an almost invariably plausible but far from meticulously accurate reproduction of the plays of Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists.</field>

Charlton Hinman subsequently identified the work of Simmes' Compositor A in Richard II ; see Richard II (Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles No. 13), 1966, p. xiv. 2 Richard II (Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles No. 13), 1966. Hinman's Compositor S is not the same workman Ferguson designates Compositor B, whose work he identifies in Q2 The First Part of the Contention (1600) and perhaps Q1 The Shoemakers' Holiday (1600). I feel certain, however, that The Contention is entirely the work of Compositor A, those features (such as some stopped speech-prefixes and occasional contrasting italic type in the body) which lead Ferguson to suspect a second compositor being the result of the influence of his (printed) copy. Spelling preferences and capitalization practices in the section in question are very similar to those in the rest of the quarto and in the other quartos produced by Compositor A. An alternate compositor is involved in The Shoemakers' Holiday , and he may be designated Compositor B, following Ferguson. This compositor was probably the alternate workman who helped Compositor S set type for Q3 Richard II , 1598. A discussion of the shares of the compositors of Q3 can be found in my unpublished dissertation (University of Kansas, 1965), "The Printing of Shakespeare's Richard II , 1597," pp. 67-68. 3 Compositor A almost always worked at case x; Compositor S always worked at case y. Four unstopped prefixes on C3 strongly suggest that Compositor A there set from case y; otherwise each worked only from his own case. A detailed analysis of the composition of the quarto is given in my dissertation, pp. 27-47. 4 Exactly how rare is difficult to say. Ferguson observes that in the three years 1599 to 1601, the 22 plays printed from manuscript by other printers almost never contain unabbreviated prefixes, p. 19. But in the sheets of Q1 Richard III printed by Peter Short (sigs. H-M) a large number of unstopped prefixes do appear. 5 This workman is probably Compositor B; see note 2, above. 6 A compositor study of Doctor Faustus Q1 appears in the unpublished dissertation (Duke, 1964) by Robert Ford Welsh, "The Printing of the Early Editions of Marlowe's Plays," pp. 85-126. Welsh identifies two compositors, X and Y [= Compositor A]. In identifying Compositor Y Welsh relies heavily on single-" l " spellings of words like will and shall . This characteristic can also be seen in Richard II Q2, set entirely by Compositor A, but is rare elsewhere in his work. 7 In Q2 The Contention Compositor A is similarly influenced by the stopped prefixes in his copy, especially in the early sheets. In the entire quarto he stopped 96 of the 372 unabbreviated prefixes. 8 See Charlton Hinman, "Shakespeare's Text—Then, Now and Tomorrow," Shakespeare Survey , 18 (1965), 26-27. Hinman records one less verbal change than I do, apparently because he does not consider an interpolated exit direction in Qb to be a substantive matter. 9 In editing Richard II it appears that different editorial policies must be adopted for a given page, depending upon which compositor set it. Judging from the evidence offered by Q3 Richard II , Compositor S was much more accurate than A — three times as accurate — making on the average one substantive change every 48 lines. Thus Compositor S was much less prone to error than A and to errors, often, of a very different kind. Compositor A, for example, omitted words 15 times as often as Compositor S did. 10 Arden King Richard II (1956), p. xix. 11 "Shakespeare's Text," pp. 31-33. 12 King Richard II , p. xix, n. 3. 13 King Richard II , pp. xvii-xviii. 14 King Richard II , pp. xviii-xix. 15 Richmond Noble, Shakespeare's Biblical Knowledge (1935), p. 158.

      <field name="heading_text">The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies by T. H. Howard-Hill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the fourteen plays printed in the Comedies section of the First Folio, only four were reprints of previously published quarto editions. For the remaining ten texts which were set up from manuscript copy, it is important therefore to discover how they were affected by the four compositors known to have set them in type. Little is understood of the habits, capacities and accuracy of these compositors: most work has been done on compositor B, virtually nothing on C and D, and compositor A of the comedies to Winter's Tale is not, as I shall show, the compositor A of the histories and later, familiar to editors mainly from the writings of Dr. Alice Walker. No attempt to study the influence of compositors on substantive readings can succeed unless the parts of the text which each compositor set are correctly assigned. The best kind of evidence useful to distinguish one compositor from another is supplied when the compositor is least influenced by the orthography of his copy, and it follows from this that evidence resting to any extent on what a compositor may or may not have done with the inferred forms of copy which does not exist, under conditions which can only be guessed at and never reproduced, is less likely to be good evidence. It is unfortunate, therefore, that compositor identification in the Folio has depended perforce mainly on this latter kind of evidence, particularly the testimony of spellings. In the following paper fresh attributions of pages of the Folio are made from combinations of evidence. This includes the compositors' various habits of spacing after commas in short lines, and at the ends of lines, their typographical arrangement of turned-over verse lines, their preferences in dealing with 'll and th' elisions, and some fairly common spellings supplementing the familiar do , go , and here . The evidence of dashes and catchwords is shown to be of small value in the comedies, but the new criteria are so generally helpful that there are few pages in the comedies for which the compositors can now be held to be uncertain. There has been some disagreement about the identification of the compositors of later texts in the Folio, but Hinman's conclusions on the compositors of the comedies have recently been discussed only in an article by Professor A. S. Cairncross which appeared after my own investigations were completed. 1 I propose here to decide the attribution of pages about which Hinman was in doubt and to question some other of his identifications with the aid of fresh evidence which was not available to him before 1963. I should therefore briefly describe the kinds of evidence that compositor study of the Folio has drawn upon and give some account of the evidence I have used here. It is not necessary to give details of the early work of Satchell and Willoughby, who mainly used spellings to distinguish between compositors, and the work of Hinman before 1963, because this is already incorporated in Printing and Proof-Reading and in Alice Walker's highly-commended Textual Problems of the First Folio . 2 She listed spellings which could be used to identify pages set by compositors A and B, and other spellings they tended to use. 3 Many of these spellings have been tested and approved by later investigators and A and B can usually be readily identified in the Folio by the criteria she supplied. There remains some doubt, however, about particular pages in which the evidence is scanty, and it is conceivable, since she worked from WT onwards, that compositor A of the early comedies is not the A of the histories and tragedies. 4 It is not always easy to use spellings, which of course provide linguistic rather than bibliographical evidence, for, without precise knowledge of the spellings of the copy from which the compositors set their Folio pages, it is hard to identify their shares of texts printed from manuscript copy of unknown character. However, Miss Walker, in common with later investigators, drew upon evidence of a more strictly bibliographical kind. She observed: Compositor B's pages have a much trimmer look than A's, partly because his tendency was to avoid turn-overs in verse by arranging a single line as two lines and partly because he set his marginal directions for exits and so on full out unless he was hurried; whereas compositor A had less prejudice against verse turn-overs and inset his stage directions irregularly. Compositor A's pages have therefore a less well-groomed appearance than B's. Another difference is that when a speech terminated with the end of a page, A generally set as catchword both the speech prefix and the first word (or an abbreviation of the first word) of the next speech; B normally set as catchword the speech prefix only. 5 The compositors were further distinguished by their use of parentheses and italics. Similar kinds of evidence were used in other studies of single texts. Although these confirmed her criteria, they did not significantly add to them. Greater advance was made by Hinman who, having already identified an apprentice compositor (E) who usually set from quarto copy in the Folio, 6 distinguished two more Folio compositors, C and D. One of his main aims in Printing and Proof-Reading was to show precisely how work on the Folio was shared amongst Jaggard's compositors. From evidence of type recurrence, changes in box-rule arrangement, running-title irregularities, page-numbering errors and similar bibliographical peculiarities, he determined the order in which the formes of type were composed, printed and distributed into the type-cases. Study of distribution evidence enabled him to show how many sets of type-cases were in use at any one time, and therefore, how many compositors were at work. Individual compositors normally worked at the same case and so knowledge of the case used in the composition of a passage of text usually suggested which compositor set it. Obviously, if two type-cases were in use together, the text set from them was most likely to have been set by two different compositors since it was impractical for them to set simultaneously from a single case. Occasionally, two compositors shared a page, and when, as in I5, distinctive types from different type-cases were found in a single page (usually in separate columns), spelling evidence revealed who the compositors were. Generally, however, knowledge of which compositors had worked from the respective cases in other pages of the quire was sufficient to identify the compositors of shared pages. However, at other times, a compositor who usually worked at one case would move to another to share the composition of a page with a compositor setting from his habitual case. Page bb3 v was shared by compositors A and B, setting from A's case x; page mm4 was shared by B and A who set from B's case y. When this occurred, and there is reason to believe that it happened more often than Hinman was able to detect, case evidence alone could not distinguish the compositors. Identifications were made principally (with such other minor criteria as dashes and catchwords) from the evidence of spellings. Spelling evidence again was generally all that showed Hinman that another compositor had set a single page in a quire quite regularly shared by two other compositors. Hinman's work is all the more admirable when one appreciates that the spellings he used to distinguish the five compositors of the Folio were the spelling variants of only three words: 'do', 'go' and 'here'. Although from time to time he referred to Alice Walker's A and B spellings, this was most often merely to confirm an identification made primarily on the evidence of 'do/go/here'. These are the only words of variable spelling which occur often enough in most pages of the Folio for distinct compositorial habits to be seen. The habitual or preferred spellings of the four main Folio compositors were found to be: A: doe, goe, here B: do, go, here C: doe, goe, heere D: doe, goe, here, but also do and go when (by assumption) they were in his copy. 7 The features of this table which contribute to the difficulty of Folio compositor identification leap to the eye. When 'here' does not occur often in the text (there are many pages from which it is absent), compositors A, C and D are indistinguishable. Similarly, when 'do' and 'go' are infrequent, B and C cannot readily be distinguished by these spellings alone. 8 Moreover, compositor D's preferences are identical with A's and, although Hinman characterises D as a compositor who would reproduce a few 'do' or 'go' spellings from his copy, unless he did this, and unless 'do' and 'go' were in his copy, these spellings cannot distinguish him from A. It is possible therefore that compositor D may be found to have set pages of the Folio, from copy in which 'doe' and 'goe' were the only spellings of these words, which have hitherto been assigned to compositor A. It is also useful to know how tolerant of their non-habitual spellings the compositors were (or, alternatively, how strongly they preferred one spelling to the other) since A and D could not be separated if A was equally prone to accept 'do' and 'go' from copy. A's preferences in the comedies are strongly defined and contrary spellings are infrequent. Compositor C on the other hand was more inclined to mix his spellings: he will tolerate 'here', and 'do/go' but not generally to the extent that he can be mistaken for D. Compositor D is fairly intolerant of 'heere' and this serves to distinguish him from C when they were setting together from copy with prevalent 'do/go' spellings. 9 From considerations such as these and his close analysis of the Folio composition and press-work, Hinman assigned 48 pages to compositor A, 121 to B, 58 to C, and 28 to compositor D, of the 302 printed pages of the comedies. There were six pages in which compositors shared. The available evidence did not permit him to be certain about the compositors of 41 other pages although often, when he indicated alternatives, his first suggestion was, by my analysis, correct. 10 The general principle can be suggested that in circumstances such as prevailed in Jaggard's printing-house, where the compositors were not expected to conform to rigid practices or house rules, the best kind of evidence for distinguishing compositors would be typographical, such as the case evidence Hinman used, or 'psychomechanical', such as varying practices in centering or arrangement of stage-directions, or the setting of dashes. 11 Often, however, these features are as scanty as characteristic spellings and sometimes they are not found on the pages where their testimony would be of greatest use. Typographical evidence may be affected by 'outside' influences such as the printing of non-Folio matter which caused the migration of types and even of compositors under circumstances that can only be guessed at. Psychomechanical evidence is affected by characteristic human fallibility or inconsistency. Compositor B's practice of putting the speech-prefix alone in catchwords is exceptionally consistent. Even so, it points to another intrinsic limitation of the kinds of evidence on which compositor identification must most often draw: when the evidence is binary, that is, when there are only two ways in which a compositor could deal with a matter (such as putting the speech-prefix alone in the catch-word, or the speech-prefix and the first word or part word of the following speech), the characteristic will still only distinguish two compositors, even if it is adhered to consistently. When as in the comedies, there are four compositors (at least) and all but compositor B are inconsistent, this characteristic on a page has little or no value as evidence, however satisfying it might be to confirm an identification made primarily from other evidence. A clear distinction, furthermore, must be made between evidence which enables the compositor of a page to be identified with reasonable confidence, and evidence which tends merely to confirm the identification or to describe the habits of that compositor. The pertinence of these comments will be seen clearly in the ensuing discussion of the kinds of evidence other than spellings which I have used for the identification of the compositors in the comedies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spacing Evidence Considerable aid has been obtained from observations of the compositors' habits of spacing commas at the end of lines of text, and inside short lines. There can be no doubt that the four compositors had different spacing habits which were habitual and distinctive: these practices usually confirm Hinman's compositor identifications. Even a facsimile of the Folio shows that some commas inside lines are followed by spaces, and that some are followed closely by the first letter of the next word: illustration of this is not necessary. 12 If there were any reason to doubt this, perhaps on the ground that different sorts were irregularly centered on the body of the type, the instances of inked spaces and quads which I have noticed in the Folio would confirm that internal spacing in short lines is a real and not an imaginary phenomenon. There is an inked space after a comma in a short line at Jn. 1970 and with commas in long lines at AWW 428 and Jn. 2207, and before a colon in a short line at TN 1324. Other interesting examples occur at Wiv. 2600, TN 1771 and R2 1074 where only one space of the two which must have been used has inked. 13 A wider space can be seen at the end of 1H6 1724. The proportions of spaced commas to non-spaced commas have been tabulated in the appendices. 14 Compositor B was the most regular in preferring to use spaces, and non-spaced commas are relatively infrequent in his pages. They sometimes occur, as will shortly be seen, in special circumstances. Compositor C also prefers to space commas but in this, as in many other practices, he is not consistent; his pages show many more commas without spaces than appear in B's pages. Usually but not always the relative proportions are sufficient to distinguish B from C but of course it is rare that spacing is the only evidence available to decide between them. Compositors A and D prefer not to space their commas, D's habit being more strongly marked. However, it is worthy of notice here that the spacing practice of A in the histories and WT is more like that of D in its preference not to space commas, and that A in the comedies apart from WT is sometimes inexplicably inconsistent in his practice from page to page. Although the counts of spaced commas amply confirm this general description of the compositors' habits, this evidence is sometimes of limited use. The number of commas, although they are usually frequent, sometimes varies considerably from page to page. Many pages have few short lines and so the count of spaced commas provides small guide to compositor identification. Consequently, on a particular page it may be impractical to rely on this evidence to distinguish between A and D who did not favour internal spacing, and B and C who did. Further, sometimes there are anomalies for which it is difficult to account. It may readily be supposed that a compositor who had almost exhausted the supply of spaces in his type-case when justifying passages of prose might be obliged to relinquish his preference for spacing in short lines. This might explain why sometimes there is a surprisingly small number of spaces in some pages set by B or C. 15 Or, on the other hand, a compositor such as A or D who preferred close spacing might in a similar situation be led to use more spaces than usual in short lines after he had become accustomed to setting them in justified lines. This might explain why compositor A in A5 v , which is mainly justified prose (with wide internal spacing after punctuation marks) has 20 spaced commas in short lines to 3 non-spaced. 16 It might also happen that the supply of spaces was depleted when non-Folio matter was set; irregularities of spacing practices might occur as such material was distributed back into the case which was being used for the Folio. When C's share of quires O, P, Q and R are studied in the order of composition, he is seen to depart from his preference for spaces after commas for sequences of pages in an order which might be explained in this way. Fortunately there is usually other evidence to show compositor C in these quires, despite the inconsistent evidence of the spaces. In the pages of King John which Hinman assigns to compositor C (a1-2 v , a5-b4) there is a large number of commas at the ends of short lines which are preceded by spaces. There are 25 on a1 v alone. These commas are more widely spaced than the spaced terminal commas which occasionally occur on pages set by the other compositors, and they are quite characteristic of C. Inked spaces before terminal commas can be seen at TGV 531 and MND 1166. As such spaced terminal commas are absent from a3-4 v which Hinman assigned to B or alternatively to C, his first attribution is the more likely to be correct. The number of such commas varies considerably from page to page, usually on account of long lines or because there were not many terminal commas (C did not space every comma at the end of a short line), but occasionally justified lines which extend to the full width of the column show widely spaced commas at the end of the line. As these are not often found in prose passages set by other compositors, they may be used with spaced terminal commas in short lines to support attribution of pages to compositor C. There are occasional instances of spaced terminal commas in pages which were clearly set by other compositors (e.g., at l. 1576 on E2, set by B), but, as the tables below show, they are undoubtedly characteristic of C. When, therefore, they have been observed on pages attributed to other compositors, I have taken this as a warning that such pages need especially close examination. I have not allowed this evidence to outweigh the testimony of spellings and the other evidence which will be discussed shortly. In fact, spacing evidence is consistent overall with the spellings and compositor identifications of Hinman and Miss Walker, and this shows that it gives good evidence for compositor identification in the Folio. Some tables will illustrate the different compositorial spacing habits, and the nature of the evidence which I have been able to apply to doubtful pages. In Jn. , which was set by C and B, the distribution of internal and terminal spaced commas in an equal number of pages set from case y is: Spacing in 'King John' 17 COMPOSITOR C COMPOSITOR B Page Terminal spaced, Medial spaced, Non-spaced, Page Terminal spaced, Medial spaced, Non-spaced, a1 5 24 10 a3 48 1 1 v 25:1j 32 27 3 v 40 4 2 25 31 14 4 42 4 2 v 23 24 18 4 v 42 5 5 12 51 14 b1 1 47 6 5 v 13:1j 47 15 1 v 65 3 6 11 51 18 2 50 4 6 v 21 42 15 2 v 61 3 b3 v 15 22 13 3 53 7 4 27 38 7 4 v 51 4 177:2 362 151 1 499 41 A glance at this table shows that although both B and C are alike in preferring to insert spaces after commas, B's habit is much stronger than C's and he rarely uses a space with a terminal comma. A group of A's pages from the early comedies, excluding pages with large amounts of prose, and anomalous pages such as B3 v and 4 v shows how his habit differs from C's. Compositor A's Spacing 18 COMPOSITOR A COMPOSITOR C Page Term. #, Med. #, Non sp. Page Term. #, Med. #, Non sp.

The spaced terminal commas in A's pages are not found in such relative profusion in later A pages, and few of them have the wide spacing that is so characteristic of C. A selection of pages set from case z, including those that Hinman used to prove that there was a fourth compositor in the Folio comedies, 19 illustrates the spacing practice of compositor D. Here, however, I must admit pages with large numbers of long lines, in order to make up a sufficiently large selection. 20 Contrasting pages set by C show also how prose affected his usual practice of spacing commas: it demonstrates that nevertheless he can be identified by spaced terminal commas.

Sometimes, however, it is not possible by this evidence alone to distinguish them in pages with many long lines. Were spacing the sole evidence by which compositors could be identified, it would not be very helpful even though there would be little difficulty in distinguishing C from B when C used his characteristic spaced terminal commas. Taken with other peculiarities, however, it is useful evidence, especially when discriminating spellings are scanty or ambiguous. Page H2 v in Err. has 2 'do', 4 'doe' and 3 'here' spellings: one of the 'here' is a rhyme and another occurs in a long line. The spacing, however, shows that this page was set by C and not by D to whom Hinman assigned it, mainly on account of the 'do' spellings. Another page in Err. with scanty and mixed spellings is H4 of which the spacing is, column a: 6/15/7; column b: 0/11/17. 21 This evidence is entirely consistent with the habits of compositors C and D. Hinman occasionally referred to A's habit of representing dashes by two or three hyphens. This is not helpful evidence in the comedies, for the only occurrence of this kind of dash before WT is on D4 which Hinman and Miss Walker assign to C; this is supported by spacing evidence (1:1/13/9). Two short dashes are found in A's D3 v , but dashes are not good evidence in the comedies, for none occurs in D's pages and both B and C prefer to set a dash by a long rule. Nor can catchwords which give the speech-prefix or the speech-prefix and the first word of the speech, supply clear-cut evidence. Compositors A and B in the histories are distinguished by their almost invariable practices, A for giving the first word of the speech, B for omitting it. But in the comedies, although B's habit is uniform, there are five pages on which A omits the first word of the speech out of 11 with this kind of catchword. C's practice is inconsistent (22 with the speech word, 11 without) but D almost always provides it: out of 19 pages, only on G1 is the speech word omitted from the catchword. There is another compositorial practice which sometimes helps to identify the compositor of a page. There are occasions on which compositors, obliged to turn over a line of verse which was too long for their measure, and unable or unwilling to set it as a turn-down or turn-up at the right margin of the column, have carried the remaining part of the line on to the next line. Often these have been indented from the left-hand margin. Lines 2658-9 on A's G5 v (the only occurrence of this in his pages) is an instance. What is remarkable about this is that it is infrequent in the pages of A and C (with whom D is most likely to be confused) and relatively frequent in the pages of B and D. One might expect that over a large number of pages set by the respective compositors the number of occasions on which they encountered long lines of verse requiring to be turned over would be roughly equal. To WT , however, the figures are: Indented Turn-overs COMPOSITOR A B C D PAGES 1 14 2 20 OCCURRENCES 1 20 2 94 It is therefore more likely than not that any page with more than one such indented turn-over was set by compositor D, and it is very unlikely to have been set by A or C.—This evidence, together with spellings, was employed to re-examine Hinman's compositor attributions in the comedies. Also helpful was the different compositorial treatment of 'will' and 'shall' elisions ( we'll, they'le, sheel and so on), especially as knowledge of Ralph Crane's spellings made it possible to allow for the influence on the compositors of copy in his handwriting. 22 There were also contrasting orthographies of 'the' elisions in i'th, o'th' and the like which served to distinguish compositors. The occurrence of this evidence is mentioned when necessary and may be consulted in the appendices. After the first form of this paper, in my thesis, was finished, Professor Cairncross's discussion of the compositors (largely in the comedies) came to hand; this offered the possibility of a stringent check on the methods and conclusions set out here. Mr. Cairncross is concerned mainly with C and D. To distinguish them he uses, besides the familiar spellings, the evidence of the future elisions ( wee'll, they'll , etc.), the layout of run-on stage-directions, and the setting of 'fareyouwell' as one word for compositor C; for D, the future elisions ( weele, theyle , etc.), - ie or - aie endings, and 'the dropping of final l , as in cal, fal, wil '. He confirms or changes Hinman's tentative attributions for 66 pages of the Folio up to sig. V. By my analysis, Cairncross is correct for all but 28 pages, although not often on the basis of the evidence he brings forward. It would be tedious to discuss every point of difference page by page but, undoubtedly, it is important to examine the kinds of evidence he has drawn upon and the way in which it has been used: nothing which leads towards certainty in these studies should be neglected. Mr. Cairncross distinguishes C from B by C's practice of indenting a two- or three-line stage direction by two or three ems; B centers the following lines after the first. 23 Compositor C is clearly partial to this kind of arrangement and there is nothing new about this. What is new is the extent to which Mr. Cairncross is prepared to take the occurrence of the indented stage direction as a sign of C's hand without the support of other evidence. Also, the value of his paper is seriously compromised by his reluctance to notice evidence which does not support his conclusions. For example, compositor C's kind of indented layout may be seen in stage directions on A1 and I3 (together with a B-type centered direction) 24 and I3, and in the letter on G2 v , which are all B pages; other indented directions occur on A5 (A), B1 (A) where there are 3 indented and 1 centered direction, and H3 v (my compositor D). As for compositor C, there are centered directions on C2 v , G4, H2 and K4 v which he reassigns to C, and on P4 v . Mr. Cairncross, observing that C disappears from F after Jn. , concludes that 'An important negative result of the new criteria is the elimination of Compositor C from quires d-gg . . . and t-x . . . oo and pp. . . . C's run-on stage directions are also absent.' 25 but this is not supported by C-type indented SD on d1 v (Hinman's B?C but B from the evidence of spacing), l3 v (B), n1 (A), p2 v (A), t6, t6 v , v2 (all C?A), x1 v (B), x3, x4 (C?A), aa2 v (B), aa3 v , cc4 Gg2 v , Gg3 v oo6, xx5, yy2, bbb2 v , bbb3, bbb3 v (all B). The elisions are in general good evidence of C's hand and so too is 'fareyouwell', although again, Mr. Cairncross omits to mention an instance of this on P2, which he reassigns from A to D. 26 With the help of such evidence Mr. Cairncross transfers 22 pages in sigs. F, G, H, I and K from compositor A or D to C; 27 in the same pages I find the hands of four compositors. The relative likelihood of Mr. Cairncross's or my attributions being correct should appear more clearly from the following discussion. It needs to be mentioned here however that his 'new' evidence is distributed very sparsely indeed throughout these pages. For instance, in F2, F3 v , F6 v , G1 v and G2, the first 5 pages he discusses, there are elisions in long lines on F2, F3 v , G1 v , no new evidence at all on F6 v , but G2 at last provides a single elision in a short line. On G5 v the sole evidence adduced for reassignment to C is 2 F-type elisions. Only on two pages (H3 v , I4 v ) does more than one kind of new evidence support reattribution. Mr. Cairncross's discussion of the evidence from which pages were confirmed or reassigned to compositor D is seriously inadequate. The elisions, as I found, are good evidence. For D's spellings of - ie and - aie and ' l/ll no statistics at all are given. In fact, when one surveys 5 pages (O5 v , O6, T5, V3 and V3 v ) which he attributes (correctly) to D, there are 86 - ie/aie to 70 - y/ay spellings and, mysteriously, only 2 - l spellings in long lines to 113 - ll forms. 28 In P1-3 v which he assigns to D, the proportion of - ie/aie to - y/ay spellings favours only his attribution of P3 v , and in the same 6 pages, there is only one - l spelling, and that is in a long line. On P4 however, there are 5 - l spellings, but this page was unquestionably set by C. Neither of these spelling tests then can on this showing be used to characterise D, and Mr. Cairncross's D evidence reduces to the elisions. It is not surprising, therefore, that he was not able to detect the alternation of C and D in H1-4 which he reassigned to C.—To conclude, I have re-examined all the reattributions discussed in the following pages and I have found no reason to alter any of them in light of Mr. Cairncross's observations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Compositor Attributions In dividing the composition of the comedies amongst the four compositors, most heed has been paid to the printing evidence and spellings set out by Hinman. Although I have questioned several of his attributions, there is none, I believe, which contradicts the spellings. The best test of the correctness of these attributions will be when the spellings of the individual compositors are studied en masse. I hope to work on such a descriptive study later. In the meantime it is enough to know which pages of the Folio comedies were set by which compositor. The attributions which are questioned or confirmed are these: Hinman's Compositor Attributions Questioned or Confirmed Text/p. Hinman Hill Text/p. Hinman Hill Tmp. B4 A?C C I5 a A?C C TGV 6 C(?)

Before these pages are discussed, there are a few minor remarks on the table which might be made. The number of pages shared by two compositors in the early comedies is consistent with Hinman's account of the printing of this part of the Folio, but his suggestion that distribution irregularities indicate that compositor D was involved in the setting needs some modification: the distribution of quires F, G, and H was irregular, not because D was present but because so many of the pages were shared by two compositors. 29 Compositor D seems to have been a cuckoo in Jaggard's printing-house and was comfortably accommodated (in the printing of the Folio, at least) only when he was given his own type-case, z, first seen in quire K. The effect of these reattributions is to diminish A's share of the comedies and to increase the importance of C and D. As these compositors set little if any of the Folio after Jn. , editors of the early comedies must pay particular attention to their characteristics. 30</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Summaries of Evidence I do not propose to discuss here the pages for which Hinman's identifications are acceptable. The evidence used is set out summarily in tables for each text printed as appendices; these include concise figures for spacing. When 'do/go/here' evidence is ambiguous, and even when it is plentiful, it is best to use all the discriminatory spellings for a particular text that can be found. In practice, however, 'do/go/here/indeed/mistress' were the only discriminants which occurred frequently enough throughout the comedies to be useful. After the comedies had been examined for the presence of these spellings, and other potentially discriminating spellings such as Miss Walker's A and B spellings, I surveyed the distribution of a miscellaneous selection of other spellings. These were 'deed' (since 'indeed' was characteristic of C, 'indeede' of the other compositors), 'doe't/ doo't/do't', and the more common elisions, 'a'th'/by'th'/i'th'/o'th'/ to'th' and 'hee'l/shee'l/they'l/you'l' and their variant spellings. The results of this investigation, which revealed different compositorial practices confirming the attributions already made from the main evidence, is set out in a table in the appendices. 31 This evidence is incorporated in the summaries of compositorial practices in the individual comedies which are also printed as appendices. 32 In Tmp. the spacing confirms Hinman's attributions except for B4 which is more likely to have been set by C than A: the presence of 'heere' gives strong support to this identification. 33 On B3 v the spacing is not in accord with A's usual practice but the three 'here' spellings, and the spelling 'indeede' which C rarely uses, do not allow this page to be assigned to C. For TGV I have had the help of a table compiled by Miss Walker for the Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare. Her spelling evidence and the spacing confirm Hinman's division of this text between compositors A and C. He was doubtful about assigning B6 and B6 v to C but the spacing shows him to have been correct. In Wiv. , where again I have benefited from an analysis of the composition by Miss Walker, the spellings of all the B pages save E1 and E6 are supported by the spacing evidence. These two pages contain many long lines which have probably disturbed B's customary preference for spaced commas inside lines. 34 Page E6, over which Hinman was in doubt, can certainly be assigned to B for it shows seven instances of 'M r ' without a point, B's almost invariable spelling. B's pages apart, spellings do not always distinguish the contributions of A and C, the other compositors of Wiv. , as there is much prose and C's distinctive 'heere' is liable to be affected by the need to justify. He was in any case apt to accept 'here' from his copy. The spellings suggest that A set D3, D3 v , E3 and E5 although the only 'here' of E3 is in a long line. However, the spacing evidence is consistent with these identifications. The spacing evidence, particularly the spaced terminal commas, similarly confirms the attributions from spelling evidence of D2, D2 v (which Hinman had assigned to A), and D4-6 v to compositor C. The compositors of MM and Err. are much more difficult to distinguish and I must devote more space to discussion of their problems. According to Hinman, compositor D is encountered for the first time in MM where supporting evidence from the order of printing is almost totally lacking. Hinman found that compositor C set F2 v where alone there is a clear preference for the speech-prefix ' Isa. ', with doe and goe , compositor B set five pages, F5 v , F6, G2 v , G3 and G3 v , and the remaining pages of quires F and G were set by A and D, their stints being separated by D's tolerance of 'do' and 'go' when it occurred in copy. Hinman commented: we cannot here adduce the combined evidence of types and spellings. In several quires in this section of the Folio (and in some, alas, that raise very tricky identification problems), such attributions to particular compositors as we make will for the most part have to be based upon spelling peculiarities alone. 35 In these quires there are many 'do/go' spellings, and 'here' occurs so frequently throughout that it is very likely to have occurred frequently in the copy for MM (and, indeed, in the texts which precede it in the Folio). In order to assign pages to D, Hinman assumed that 'do' and 'go' were also present in the copy, which is probable enough, and he drew upon the evidence of D's relative tolerance of these spellings which he had observed when establishing the presence of a fourth compositor in the Folio. 36 However, in order to give F1 v , F6 v , G1 v , G4 and G4 v to compositor D, he had to allow him eleven 'heere' spellings as against only four 'here's. 'Here' is the spelling which distinguishes D from compositor C, so on his own showing, Hinman's compositor identifications are hardly satisfactory. They would have been more persuasive had D been setting from his case z, but that case, with the assumption that a new compositor had joined in work on the Folio, is not seen until quire K where also Hinman identified compositor D. As the customary spellings are inadequate, it is necessary to draw upon a wider range of evidence. Other compositorial practices described earlier offer helpful support in some pages, but no evidence is more generally useful than that of the spacing of terminal and medial commas. The spacing evidence of quires F and G by columns runs as follows: Spacing in Quires F and G, by Columns * Col. a Col. b Page Hinman's comp. Hill's comp. Term. #, Med. #, Non sp. Hill's comp.

C 8 2 C 6 8 Patently, many of the pages which Hinman assigns to D have contrary spacing practices from column to column. Also, the spacing of medial commas on Hinman's D pages is not consistent with compositor D's practice in the case z pages of quire K where he does not prefer to use spaces after commas in short lines. 37 Further, the absence of spaced terminal commas from C's page F2 v and the number of them elsewhere suggests that Hinman's attributions need closer examination. The table also shows that compositor B's strong inclination towards the use of spaces after commas is confirmed by the pages which Hinman assigned to him and that there are other columns which might also, if the spellings were agreeable, have been set by this compositor. Compositor B's spellings are so distinctive and frequent that his contribution to MM may be dealt with summarily. Hinman noted that the spellings of G1 v resembled compositor B's but assigned the page to D against the evidence of 'heere' because 'there is no other evidence to suggest that B had any share in the setting of the last three formes of quire G. . .'. 38 The printing of quire F was so irregular that an appeal to normality carries little weight, but as the table shows, B is found in the last three formes of quire G, in column a of G1. There are no contrary spellings, the spacing agrees with what is known of B's practice, the spellings are incompatible with the habits of the other compositors, including D, and as can be seen from the earlier table of spacing in MM , the two columns of G1 contrast in spelling and spacing evidence. G1 was therefore shared by B and another compositor. Other pages show different spacing habits between columns: this suggests but of course does not prove that two compositors shared in the composition. There are other pages and columns in which the incidence of spaced terminal commas points to compositor C. Hence F4 and F4 v are more likely to have been set by C than any other compositor (certainly not A or D who did not favour internal spaces), and so too are F5a, G4a, G6 v b where the distribution of spaced terminal and internal commas contrasts with the practice of the other column of the page. The spacing evidence is most useful to distinguish C, who, as Tmp. , TGV and Wiv. show, will accept 'do', 'go' and 'here' occasionally from copy, but it is less useful to distinguish A and D, particularly when many of the columns have large numbers of long lines. Their stints have been assigned, as far as other spellings permit, on the principle of minimising the number of 'do/go' spellings allowed to A. The evidence I have used and my final allocation of columns to A, C and D is set out in a table facing this page. It may be that C's partner in the shared pages of quire F was sometimes A rather than D to whom, where the spellings are not conclusive, I have assigned columns so that quire F was shared by two compositors other than B. The picture that this division of work presents of activities in Jaggard's printing-house is most unusual. 39 It is scarcely to be conceived that the Folio would ever have been published had this been the ordinary method of working. Yet the absence of corroboration from type recurrence and distribution which Hinman noticed is perhaps more readily explained if the compositors shared many pages of these quires and distributed whole pages, rather than the portions each had set, into the type-cases which were free at the moment. In any event, Hinman's account of the printing shows that when the printing of Wilson's Christian Dictionary came to an end and compositor D was free to work more often on the Folio, normal routine was upset. The irregular distribution of these quires arose, I suggest, not because compositor D's practice was irregular (as Hinman thought) but because the division of setting amongst four compositors working from two cases led to unusual practices. A's 'indeede' is found on G4 v a (2439) and G5 v (2718j), 'she'll' on G5 v (2654j), 'we'll' on G5 v (2743, 2690j), and there is an indented verse turn-over on G5 v a. Characteristic C spellings are 'they'll' on F2 (236j), 'you'll' on F3 v (685j) and G6 v (2935), 'deed' on F4 (848) and G6 (2853) but 'deede' on G4a (2291), 'doe't' twice on F4 (799, 802j), 'shee'll' on G2b (1841), and 'wee'll' on G5 (2638j) and G6 v (2937). An indented turn-over occurs on D's F1b, 'indeed' on F1 v a (131j), 'indeede' on F3 (558, 561, 550j, 581j) and F2b (331j), 'youle' on F3 (589), and 'doo't' on F5b (1071, 1074). A is characterised by his preference for italicising ' Duke/s ', ' Prouost ', and ' Frier ' and his intolerance of 'do', 'go' and 'heere'. He seems to have preferred ' Duk. ' to ' Duke. ' as the speech-prefix. Compositor C on the other hand did not generally italicise these words although it is consistent with his habits elsewhere in the Folio that occasionally he should do so. He was more prone than A to accept 'do' from his copy, though not as often as D, and his readiness to take 'here' from copy has been noted in the preceding comedies. He inclined to the speech-prefix ' Duke .' Compositor D did not tolerate 'heere' and did not italicise 'Duke/s', but apart from his willingness to accept 'do' and 'go' from his copy, his habits are similar to A's. These were the general grounds for the compositor identifications from spellings in quires F and G. There is not much useful evidence on F1 and F1 v . Compositor C clearly set F1 v b. Page F2 is divided on spacing evidence between C and D, on account of the 'do' spellings and ' Frier .' Page F2 v contains the 17 ' Isa. ' speech-prefixes which led Hinman to assign this page to a compositor (C) who otherwise, since other pages show mixed forms of the speech-prefix, did not participate in the setting of MM . In the other sections of the text which I give to C he preferred ' Isab. ' but the unitalicised 'Duke' and 'Prouost', together with the spacing, obliges me to conclude that in this first page in which he encountered ' Isa. ' compositor C followed copy. The spacing of F3 is inconclusive, but the 'do/go' spellings suggest D rather than A. Spacing and Hinman's conclusion that the pages of the first forme were set by the same compositor makes it most likely that F3 v was set by C, despite such A spellings as 'ile' and 'here'. In F4, F4 v and F5a the large number of spaced terminal commas makes C the compositor, but D seems to have set F5b where there are two 'do' spellings and a great number of medial commas without spaces. The 'heere' spellings and 'Frier' (1501) show that F6 v b is C's as also the other column may be, but the 'do' spellings there encourage me to maintain the division of quire F between C and D. Compositor B's partner in G1b is assuredly D as 'do', 'Duke/s' and ' Frier ' show, and the spacing and 'do' of G2a show that that column was also set by D. His partner may well have been A since the spacing is inconclusive, but the unitalicised 'Friar' (1566) and the preponderance of ' Duke. ' speech-prefixes indicate C, to whom, with the support of his characteristic 'shee'll' (1841), G2b may also be given. Spacing and spelling evidence agree to show C as the compositor of column a of G4 which was evidently shared by two compositors. Compositor A is more likely, on the showing of four ' Duke 's and two ' Frier 's, than D to have been C's partner, and similar evidence divides G4 v between the same compositors. Spacing and spellings alike show C to have set the whole of G5 and A to have set G5 v . Contrasting spellings divide G6 between A and C, but only the elisions show C to have set the short page G6 v . Discriminating spellings are scanty in Err. where, fortunately, Hinman's attribution of H4 v , H5, H6, H6 v and I1-2 v to compositor B is amply confirmed by the spacing and other characteristic practices, such as the setting of 'M r , without a point, which have been noticed in his pages previously. 40 The compositors of the remaining pages are not as readily distinguished, for again on pages which Hinman assigned to D, B's partner in Err. , there is conflict of spacing evidence between the columns of some pages. Spaced terminal commas indicate that C was responsible for H1 and H1 v a where his characteristic 'heere' is seen, but not column b where, although there is one spaced terminal comma, the other spacing and two 'indeede's tell against him. He also set H2b where 'heere' is found; five 'Mistris' spellings in column a and six 'Mistresse's in column b show that H4 was set by different compositors. The spacing of H2 v and H3a (which also has 'Mistresse' spellings) identifies C as the compositor but he is unlikely, despite the spaced comma in column a, to have set H3 v which has many indented turn-overs of verse lines: these are also found on H3b and H4b which C did not set. (Compositor C also set H4a as the spacing and 'heere' show.) His partner in the shared pages where 'do' and 'go' sometimes occur is therefore more likely to have been D than A. I have assigned the remainder of Err. , where indented verse turn-overs are frequent, to D. Happily, after MM and Err. the printing of the comedies became more regular and never again are the compositors found sharing the setting of single pages in such numbers. Undoubtedly the introduction of a fresh type-case, case z, from which hereafter D usually set, contributed greatly to normalisation of the compositorial work from Ado. onwards. In the rest of quire I, quire K and L1 which make up Ado. , Hinman distinguished three compositors. Two are B, and D setting from case z, whereas the compositor who set from case x was doubtfully A, C, or both. The spellings do not give good evidence because much of Ado. is prose, but the spacing evidence leaves little doubt that the compositor of case x was C, even though, because of the many long lines, some of the spacing counts are inconclusive. The spellings, especially 'indeed' which only C sets against the copy spelling, supports C's composition of the pages I attribute to him. The spacing also shows him to have set M1-3 v of LLL where Hinman was in doubt: all the evidence is consistent with division amongst B, C and D (setting from case z). Spacing also confirms D as the compositor of N6 v of MND . 41 In MV there are anomalies of spacing in C's pages but the spaced terminal commas give good evidence of his presence. Page P1 v , which Hinman assigned to C from the spellings, I have given to D on the evidence of indented turn-overs and spacing. 42 The absence of 'do/go' spellings cannot tell against D in MV because there are none at all in quarto copy. Accordingly I have reassigned Hinman's A pages of quire O which were set from case z to compositor D: 'youle' on O5 v and the spacing supports this, but great confidence is not possible when the only spellings which distinguish D from A cannot, by the nature of the copy, occur very frequently. I should perhaps note that Hinman shifted his ground here: compositor D, who was earlier identified by his tolerance of 'do/go' when they were in his copy is now identified because copy 'doe' and 'goe' were 'needlessly' changed to 'do' and 'go'. 43 In short, compositor D not only tolerated these spellings but also occasionally used them against copy: in this his habit is like C's. The spellings of MV are not so clear that it can be certain that every page has been correctly assigned to A and D, and a closer analysis may find that all pages set from case z were set by compositor D. None of Hinman's compositor identifications in AYL has been changed but in Shr. pages T5-6 v which he assigned to A are more likely to have been set by D. The compositor set from a new type-case which had been freshly distributed into, so type evidence is not available to aid the identification of the compositor. 44 There are too many 'do/go' spellings for compositor A (it is suggestive that there is only one such spelling in C's pages: apparently 'do/go' were not frequent in copy) and the indented verse turn-overs, which occur on all four pages, and D's characteristic 'weele' on T5, support reattribution to him. To these D pages may be added V3 and V3 v of AWW where, because there is only one 'do/go' spelling, Hinman identified A. However, the elisions are strong evidence of compositor D and there are indented verse turn-overs on both pages: compositor D was responsible for them. Compositor B set the whole of TN and shared WT , the last text in the comedies section, with compositor A. The compositor identifications from a detailed investigation of the composition of WT by J. H. P. Pafford were confirmed by Hinman. Dr. Pafford noticed that B's page Bb3 contains a fairly large number of uncharacteristic spellings; his table shows, for example, four 'here's. 45 But as Hinman commented, all but one of the non-B spellings in this page occur in long lines; all the 'here' spellings are in long lines, and three of them are 'here's' spellings, B's frequent justified form. Spacing evidence confirms this page as his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Compositor A in the Comedies and Histories I have already mentioned the possibility that the A of the early comedies and the A of WT and the histories were not the same compositor. Anomalies in the summary of A's habits on p. 85 suggest that this question deserves some consideration. It will be noticed that the compositor of WT prefers 'indeed', 'mistresse', "x'th'" and 'x'le' whereas in A's pages of Tmp. , TGV , Wiv. , MM and MV the corresponding preferences are 'indeede', 'mistris', "x'th/xth'" and 'x'll'. 46 This evidence is too scanty for the influence of copy to be dismissed, but there are other differences between the habits of the compositor in the two groups of pages. The simplest test of the integrity of the compositor is to observe the occurrence of the spellings which Miss Walker has identified as characteristic of A in WT and the later plays of the Folio. In the table below I have included some other useful spellings, and counts of the elisions. From this it is clear that the compositor A of R2 , which was partly set before WT and finished after it, and the A of WT are one and the same. Although I have not represented the histories which preceded the setting of quire d of R2 in the table, apart from the elision counts, A's spellings there are consistent with the spellings in the table. Nothing I have observed suggests that A changed his habits in the histories. This confirms Miss Walker's description of A's habits. Comparison of the spellings of this part of the Folio with the summary for the five plays in which A shared before WT shows many contrasting features. It is possible to discount the elisions in Tmp. where the compositor, fresh to work of this kind, was possibly more greatly influenced by copy than he usually was. Compositor B also seems to have set a fair number of elisions from copy in Tmp. , Wiv. , and WT . Copy influence can not entirely explain the variation between the "'ll" and "'le" elisions although undoubtedly some of them, and some of the other spellings listed in the table, were taken from copy. There is a common preference for 'doe/goe/here' and a strong disinclination to set 'do/go/heere' other than in long lines, but the compositor's use of other variant spellings differs between the groups of pages. This matter is relevant because of the five plays printed before WT in which compositor A had a hand, four ( Tmp. , TGV , Wiv. , MM ) are texts which were probably printed (and WT also) from copy prepared by Crane. If for the moment it is conceded that the copy was Crane's, and if the compositor A of the early comedies and histories is taken to be a single compositor, it is still impossible to explain the different counts by reference to Crane's spellings. 47 Both Crane and the histories A prefer 'deuill', yet that spelling does not occur from Tmp. to MM ; instead there are 12 'diuell's. Crane preferred 'howre' and the A of the histories tolerated 'hower' 48 yet no such spelling occurs in the early comedies. The histories A would tolerate 'mistresse' from copy; 'mistris' is Crane's spelling and A uses it 22 times in the early comedies, yet in WT , the copy for which was presumably in the same hand, 7 'mistresse' spellings occur and only two of the spellings which are assumed to have been in copy. The single 'indeed' is possibly a copy spelling for that was Crane's invariable spelling, yet there are 17 'indeede' spellings in the early comedies. In WT 'indeed' occurs ten times, but these are not likely to have been taken from copy as 'indeed' is also the preferred spelling of A's pages in the histories. 'Yong' is the spelling of Crane and the A of the comedies but in WT the compositor sets 'young', the characteristic spelling of A of the histories. Miss Walker's compositor A, in short, prefers 'deare', 'deuill', 'suddaine' and 'young' whereas the compositor of the early comedies prefers 'deere', 'diuell', 'sodaine' and 'yong'. There is other evidence. The spacing is not altogether clear since spaced commas inside short lines are not favoured in either group of pages. However, the table of spacing 49 shows that whereas the comedies compositor would quite often space a fair number of internal commas, occasionally more than were left without spaces, the practice of the histories A is much more pronounced and never, in the plays I have examined, is there a greater number of spaced commas to unspaced commas. Also, before WT , the compositor A was indifferent to whether he set the first word of the speech together with the speech-prefix in a catchword, or the speech-prefix alone, but in the histories his invariable practice was to supply the first word of the dialogue with which the next page started. The evidence is such that it is not possible to believe that a single compositor is found in A's pages of the comedies and histories without serious doubt being cast on the principles on which compositor identifications from spelling are made. There could be little objection to this if the procedures of spelling analysis had been called into question elsewhere in the Folio, or in other books. A compositor might change his preference from one form of a spelling to another over a period of time, or perhaps admit so many copy-spellings against his usual practice that in a particular text it might be difficult to discern his presence, but one does not expect (and indeed, I have not found) a compositor to change a number of established practices at once. There is no practical alternative to the belief that when compositorial practices change between groups of texts, a change of compositor is indicated. This is the basis of compositor determination in the Folio, and if application of the principle has proved adequate to distinguish B from D, for example, it should be possible to distinguish between the compositors of the early comedies and the histories on the same ground. There is some further support for the maintenance of this principle in that none of the other compositors' habits changed significantly during the course of the Folio's printing though, since they set from the same kinds of copy as A had before him, they would have been just as exposed as he was to copy spellings contrary to their own. I can see little alternative but to conclude that there was another compositor in the early comedies; henceforth I shall refer to him as F. 50 In other folios printed by Jaggard about this time, the principal compositors of the Folio can be identified in discrete sections of the books by their usual spellings. 51 However, there are patterns of spellings, particularly in Favyn, with which compositors A, B, C, and D of the Folio cannot easily be readily identified. Compositorial patterns in these books are so generally consistent from one folio to the other that one can be reasonably confident that the compositors have been correctly identified. Nevertheless, there are some sections distinguished by firm compositorial spelling preferences which cannot be identified, especially after, say, the Folio A, has already been distinguished in that book. When I made my survey of these folios in 1965 I was inclined then to conclude that there was another Jaggard compositor but deferred the conclusion until work on the Folio supplied further evidence. 52 It is most likely that more work on other Jaggard books of the time will confirm that Jaggard used at least five compositors before he took on the apprentice E.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "Compositors C and D of the Shakespeare First Folio," PBSA , 65 (1971), 41-52. 2 Early use of spellings to identify compositors is discussed in some detail in my "Spelling and the Bibliographer," Library , 5th. ser., 18 (1968), 1-28. 3 Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953), p. 9. 4 Compositor A is discussed on pp. 84-88 where I conclude that the compositor of the comedies before WT is not A of the Histories. For ease of reference, however, I continue to use the accepted designation in this discussion. 5 Textual Problems , p. 10. 6 C. Hinman, "The Prentice Hand in the Tragedies of the Shakespeare First Folio: Compositor E," SB 9 (1957), 3-20. 7 Hinman discusses the 'do/go/here' spellings of these compositors in The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , (1963), I, 18-200. Since the fifth compositor, E, does not appear in the comedies, I have not referred to his habits here. 8 Miss Walker has noticed that B alone sets 'Mr' without a point; this is useful evidence in Wiv . 9 These general observations may be checked in the summary tables of compositorial spellings on pp. 89-91. 10 These figures were compiled from the 'tabular synopsis' in Hinman, II, 514-15. 11 Mr. Cairncross's use of the arrangement of SD to identify compositors is discussed briefly on pp. 72-74. 12 To MV I worked from the Malone Folio in the Bodleian Library, thereafter from the Norton facsimile. Hinman's through-line-numbering system is used throughout for reference. 13 Other inked quadrats and spaces may be seen at Wiv. 2420, 2421; MM 2690; MV 2396, 2397; AYL 1671; Shr. 300; WT 3355; Jn. 229 and 2H6 3302. 14 Whether any particular comma is counted as spaced or non-spaced depends partly on individual judgement; preceding or succeeding sorts and the extent to which they are correctly centered, may influence judgement. The italic ligature ' us ', for instance, seems always to be followed by a space, but whether there is one in a particular instance is difficult to decide. My counts, therefore, may differ (even though they have been repeated and checked) from the counts of others.—Counts of spaced commas column by column for the pages of the comedies form appendix I of 'Ralph Crane and five Shakespearian First Folio comedies', D. Phil. thesis, Oxford University, 1970. 15 See for example in the tables on pp. 90-103 the figures for pages with many long lines in Tmp., TGV, Wiv. , and MV set by B and C who normally preferred to set spaces after commas in short lines. 16 The spellings do not allow A5 v to be assigned to any other compositor. 17 In this table and hereafter, 'j' is used to denote occurrence in a long line. When spellings or spaced terminal commas occur in both short and long lines, the counts are given in the form '3:1'. 18 This is the A of the comedies, whom I later name 'F'; see pp. 85-87. 19 Hinman, I, 196-197. 20 Such pages are asterisked in the tables. 21 I shall cite the counts of spacing in this form hereafter: the figures are for spaced terminal commas, spaced medial commas, and non-spaced commas inside short lines respectively. 22 Ralph Crane and some Folio Comedies , a monograph based on an Oxford D.Phil. thesis (see note 14), has just been published by the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia (1972). 23 Cairncross, p. 42, does not show the indentation of C's SD; there is a misprint in B's example. Q2 in the antepenultimate line should be O2. 24 Cairncross, p. 50, suggests that A1, on account of the initial SD, was started by C. 25 Cairncross, p. 50. 26 The distribution of the main variants of 'fareyouwell' may be of interest: fare-thee-well D5 v , farethee well ssl v , fareyouwel K5, fareyouwell G4, P2, R4, a6 v , farthee well Gg2 v (2), fartheewell Z2 v , Bb2, faryewell O4, O4 v , faryouwell P5, far-thee-well Z2 v . 27 Cairncross, p. 44. 28 These figures come from a fairly hasty manual count and may be inaccurate, though not, it is believed, to an extent that affects the argument. 29 See Hinman II, 380 ff. for an account of the irregular distribution of this part of the comedies. There is nothing intrinsically unlikely about compositors sharing pages: it occurred elsewhere in the Folio even after work practices had become more regular. See also p. 80. 30 Unlike Mr. Cairncross I find some traces of C in the spacing of some of the pages of the Tragedies section which Hinman assigns to him, but I am unable to write confidently on this at the moment. 31 See pp. 105-106. 32 See pp. 92-104. 33 On the separate identity of compositor A before WT , see pp. 84-88. 34 See pp. 67-68. 35 Hinman II, 379. 36 Hinman I, 196-200. * Asterisks denote columns with many long lines. 37 See p. 70. 38 Hinman I, 408. 39 Hinman divides quire F, as I divide G, amongst four compositors. 40 In Err. , on H4 v (956), H6 v (1386) and I1 v (1647). 41 Henceforth, to Wt , I discuss only the pages where Hinman's identifications have been questioned or confirmed. 42 Hinman I, 415, commented that 'Pl v could have been set by D'. 43 Hinman I, 415-417. 44 Hinman II, 452 arbitrarily named this case x. 45 Pafford, " The Winter's Tale : typographical peculiarities in the Folio text", N&amp;Q , 206 (1961), 172-178. The table is on p. 174. 46 In an earlier investigation for which Hinman's attributions were accepted, but drawing only on the pages about which he was certain, I noticed variation between A's preferred spelling of been/beene/bin and honor/honour in Tmp. , TGV , Wiv. , and MM , and WT . This and the other evidence is all the more significant if the copy for all these texts had been prepared by the same scribe. In A's pages of the early comedies there are many bin's (Crane's strongly-preferred spelling was byn), a scattering of beene spellings, and no been 's at all, yet been is the dominant spelling of A's pages of WT , and there are no bin spellings. In R2 , A changes bin to beene . 47 Crane's spellings of some of the words mentioned here are: doe , goe , here , deere , deuil/l , greif/ue , howre , indeed , mistris , sodaine , yeare/yeere , yong . 48 Walker, Textual Problems , p. 9. 49 See p. 89. 50 It is wise to reserve the denomination A for the familiar A of the histories. 51 These folios are Mille's Treasurie , 1619 ( STC 17936), Boccaccio's Decameron , 1620 ( STC 3172), Burton's Description of Leicestershire , 1622 ( STC 4179), Vincent's Discoverie of Errours , 1622 ( STC 24756), and Favyn's Theater of Honour , 1622-3 ( STC 10717). 52 Since my work on these folios relied on spellings derived from Hinman's compositor identifications, I am unwilling at the moment to write more specifically about the compositors in these books. The inescapable point is that these folios show mutually exclusive spelling-patterns, and more than are found in the Folio hitherto. The inference must be made that more than four compositors were employed in their composition. * Where there are two totals, the first excludes WT ; subsequent citations refer to R2 (from c5), WT, H5, 1H6, 2H6, 3H6 (04 + only) and R2 cont., in Hinman's order of printing. This division demonstrates the distinct identities of compositor F (to WT ) and A (from Aa1).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Richardson's Revisions of Clarissa in the Second Edition by Shirley Van Marter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been known for a long time that both the manuscript and printed text of Clarissa were extensively revised by Samuel Richardson, but his changes attracted no serious published attention until recently. In May, 1968 Eaves and Kimpel brought together in one article 1 scattered comments from Richardson's correspondence and private papers to illuminate the thorny problems posed by the revisions he made prior to the first edition, printed in 1748. Since none of the several manuscript drafts has survived, Eaves and Kimpel base their chronology of the pre-publication composition of Clarissa on evidence that is limited in certain respects, but nonetheless significant enough to establish beyond doubt Richardson's enormous concern to improve his novel through constructive advice from others, as well as through meticulous self-criticism. No study of Richardson's revisions in his published text, comparable in thoroughness to Eaves and Kimpel's handling of the pre-publication problems, has yet appeared. Kinkead-Weekes made a start toward such an undertaking in his stimulating article " Clarissa Restored?" 2 but his prime concern in that study was to examine the more general question of whether Richardson's addenda consist wholly of restorations from earlier versions, or whether newly invented material is also included. Most of his evidence is drawn from two different sources that Richardson left behind about his own revisions: a handwritten memorandum 3 in which he itemized the "most Material" changes he made in the second edition, and a separate volume Letters and Passages Restored from the Original Manuscripts of the History of Clarissa , which he offered to the public at the same time as the third edition (1751) "for the Sake of doing Justice to the Purchasers of the Two First Editions." No independent study of Richardson's revisions, based on a collation of all four editions published during the author's lifetime (1748, 1749, 1751, 1759), has yet appeared to check on the completeness and accuracy of Richardson's own records. I have recently collated these four editions, and the purpose of this paper is to present my findings on the first set of revisions he made in print — the second edition of 1749. Besides providing further evidence of Richardson's reflective habits, and of his exchanges with his contemporary audience, the changes in his most famous novel also have direct bearing on the recently growing interest in critical editions of Richardson's works. Since he added over two hundred pages of text to Clarissa by the time of the third edition in 1751, it has generally been assumed that the third, or some combination of the third and fourth, best illustrates his final intention. Following that assumption, all modern editors (with one very recent exception) have printed the third rather than the first. Neither the Everyman edition, first published in 1932, nor the Modern Library abridgement of 1950 identifies which text it uses, but they both are in fact based on some version of the third edition. George Sherburn's abridgement for the Riverside Editions (1962) explicitly states that it follows the typical pattern of conflating passages from different texts and "is based on the faulty text given in Everyman's Library, which has been collated with that of 1759, which in turn, chiefly for misprints, omissions of essential words, etc., has been compared with the texts of 1748 and 1751." 4 The modern version generally regarded as "standard," though having no special claim to that designation, is the Shakespeare Head Edition of 1930, now out of print. It is based on the 1751 text, and according to the editors, it follows all of that edition's "inconsistencies of spelling and punctuation . . . as faithfully as possible." The one exception to this practice is Philip Stevick's abridged version, published in April, 1971 for the Rinehart Press. Following Kinkead-Weekes' suggestion that the third edition "is in many ways cruder than the first," Mr. Stevick argues that the first is the better one: "although the revised text is better prose, the text in the first edition produces far more successfully the illusion of authentic letters unmediated by a controlling author. . . . The substantial difference between the editions, however, lies not in such small and subtle variations but in great blocks of material which were added to the third edition." 5 It is these large blocks of material that Kinkead-Weekes had previously argued were probably restored by Richardson in response to a hostile public. "But if the changes are proved to be," Kinkead-Weekes asks, "with relatively few exceptions, the direct result of the misinterpretations of an uncritical audience, the definition of 'intention' becomes less simple. Which represents Richardson's real intention: the novel he wrote expecting an audience capable of appreciating it, or the revisions for one he found careless, superficial, and sentimental?" 6 This is where the problem now stands. Before it can be solved, much more evidence is needed about precisely what Richardson did change in his variant editions. Only the full scope of the evidence can help scholars determine whether it is true that the substantial difference between the editions lies not in "small and subtle variations" but primarily in the large blocks of material inserted into the third version. On the basis of these findings an editor can then decide which text represents the author's final intention, which one offers scholars the best critical text of Clarissa , which version achieves maximum power as an artistic masterpiece, and which one should finally be printed to make a popular edition available for the pleasure of new generations of readers. There are no easy answers or procedures with respect to any of these four issues. Each one confronts more than one option; the evidence presented by Richardson's revisions is voluminous and exceedingly complex; the assumptions and criteria used to support any conclusion need to be carefully tested against alternatives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i Richardson saw four editions through the press during his lifetime: the first in 1748 (actually published in three installments: Vols. I-II, December 1, 1747; Vols. III-IV, April 28, 1748; Vols. V-VII, December 6, 1748); the second in 1749, which consists of only the first four volumes of his novel; the third in 1751; and the fourth in 1759. 7 Following Sale's practice, I count the one printed in 1759 as the fourth edition. A deluxe "fourth" edition in octavo was published simultaneously with the less expensive third in duodecimo (1751), but since it is identical in text with the third, I have not included it in my study. By the time Richardson was preparing his third installment (Vols. V-VII) for printing in December 1748, almost a year after the first two volumes had appeared, he realized he would soon need a new edition. For this reason he printed enough copies of the third installment to accompany a new printing of Volumes I-IV. This is why the second edition consists of only four volumes, or approximately one-half of the novel. It terminates with Clarissa's escape to Hampstead Heath and Lovelace's new schemes to recapture her. This new printing of Volumes I-IV was offered to the public on June 15, 1749, only six months after the third and final installment of the first edition. Since the truncated second edition has no new Volumes V-VII of its own, any collation must reckon with this fact. From the point of view of the evolution of the text, the second or intermediate stage between 1748 and 1751 is only partly complete. Volumes V-VIII of the third edition must be compared directly with Volumes V-VIII of the first. It is probable that Richardson made some changes right on the manuscript or proof sheets of the third installment before they actually were printed for the first time. His letter of May 10, 1748 lends plausibility to the assumption that he may have been planning his revised second version even while preparing the last three volumes of his first one. Written only three months after the initial publication of Volumes I-IV, this letter indicates that he planned to recast the final three volumes extensively: "I know not whether it [ Clarissa ] has not suffer'd by the Catastrophe's being too much known and talked of. . . . I had never, however, designed that the Catastrophe should be known before Publication; . . . I have so greatly alter'd the two last Volumes, that one half of the Sequel must be new written." 8 It is not unlikely that while rewriting during the next seven months, he may well have been marking his first four volumes in preparation for the second edition. He already knew he needed it. Richardson certainly prepared his 1749 text meticulously. Almost every page contains at least one substantive change, most contain from two to eight or more. Over 1,000 changes occur in Volume I alone, and each of the other volumes is revised as thoroughly. The majority of smaller revisions are designed to correct and elevate the text in tone, as well as to render it more concrete and vivid. Syntax becomes smoother; grammar is corrected; diction is elevated; thousands of contractions are expanded; abbreviations and numbers are spelled out. 9 All this creates a more carefully polished text to replace the first printed edition. In the matter of grammar alone, hundreds and hundreds of minute changes are systematically inserted into the text. Subjects are frequently added ("Will receive" is changed to "I will receive"); understood verbs are made explicit ("against your" to "against taking your"); objects are inserted ("have her without" to "Have her without Marriage "); prepositions are included ("man whom" to "man to whom"); conjunctions are filled in ("thinks I have" to "thinks that I have"); and many dangling prepositional constructions are eliminated ("I ought to have been bound by" to "by which I ought to have been bound"). Verb tenses are altered selectively ("has not" to "had not," "cheapens" to "cheapened," "were" to "was" but also "was" to "were," "shall" to "should," etc.); the past participle of some verbs is changed, though not consistently ("forbid" to "forbidden," "broke" to "broken," "forgot" to "forgotten," "shook" to "shaken"); the subjunctive is now more often employed ("If that comes to pass" to "if that come to pass"); conjunctions are altered ("But" to "Altho'"); adverbs are corrected ("Sure" to "Surely"); and fourteen comparative adjectives are revised ("the charming'st women" to "the most charming," "cruellest" to "most cruel," "favourablest" to "most favourable," etc.). At least 200 pronouns were altered to clarify the meaning of specific sentences and to achieve greater concreteness. Thirty instances of the indefinite pronoun "one" or "one's" were eliminated in favor of personal pronouns or descriptive nouns such as "we," "our," "a Libertine," "the blusterer," etc. In at least 170 other cases, Richardson changed a pronoun to a noun, or a common noun to a proper noun, for greater precision in his meaning: "he" becomes "The Captain," "Mr. Lovelace," "Mr. Hickman," etc.; "she" becomes "Mrs. Greme," "Miss Howe," "the good woman," etc.; "they" becomes "my Brother and Sister," "it" becomes "the parcel," "humour," "marriage," etc.; "theirs" becomes "the silly people," etc. Richardson also sharpened his meaning by discriminating thoughts, actions, and things with more specificity. Clarissa reports that Lovelace contrived "some wicked stratagem" rather than "some way or other"; she worries that she will be "called uncivil" for refusing Miss Partington her bed rather than "called so"; she takes exception to Lovelace's "haughty looks" not "how he looked"; and Anna skirmishes with her mother over a prohibited "Letter" not a "paper." Other changes are widespread and they shift words like "person" to "woman," "sex" to "Men," "women" to "wives," "man" to "Lover," "This letter" to "my mother's Letter," "thing" to "proceeding," "That" to "Over-delicacy," etc. A whole series of revisions is designed to smooth out confusing details and to clarify complex syntax structures. Many are too long to quote here, and not all of them are successful. But even a few examples of Richardson's shorter revisions will suggest what happens in his text. Clarissa's involuted reference to her brother James is changed from "unbrotherly nephew" to simply "my Brother"; her mention of "my father's family" becomes "our family," "more undelightful" becomes "and of consequence less pleasing," "for my mind's sake," becomes "for me," the " when " becomes the "time for it," "The contrary window," becomes "the most distant window," "was silent for a considerable space" becomes "was silent for some time," "she is full of fears of consequences" becomes "she is very fearful of the consequences," etc. Another large set of revisions systematically alters various terms of address throughout the second edition. One of the most obvious patterns is the disappearance of Clarissa's childlike use of "mamma" and "papa." In 1749 Richardson consistently replaced these two words with the more restrained greeting "Mother" and "Father." Since there are 305 of these changes in Volume I alone, the difference in tone between the two editions is considerable. A second pattern affects the titles of Lovelace's family, members of the aristocratic class. Richardson professed ignorance of the proper modes of address while working on his last novel, Sir Charles Grandison , and appealed to his correspondents for help. His letter to Lady Dorothy Bradshaigh, dated October 5, 1753, indicates that he had been troubled by matters of social decorum even when writing his two earlier novels: "The Wonder at the Mistakes in Pamela and Clarissa, as to the Titles of Characters, will be lessened, when it is known, that my Ignorance of Proprietys of those Kinds, was one of the Causes; another that writing without a Plan." 10 We do not know where he received his help in 1749, but it is clear that he corrected 51 titles that designate Lovelace's relations: "Aunt Lawrance" is regularly emended to "Lady Betty" or "Lady Betty Lawrance,"; "his aunt Sadleir" to "Lady Sarah," or "Lady Sarah Sadleir"; Lovelace's "uncle" to "Lord M." or "his Lordship." A more formal tone is introduced even for characters in the novel who are not part of the nobility, although they are not addressed above their rank. Anna now writes to Clarissa of "Mr. Hickman" instead of "Hickman," and she instructs Clarissa to leave letters for her at "Mr. Wilson's" not "Wilson's." Lovelace now speaks of "Mrs. Howe" not "Goody Howe," and on one occasion the servant Hannah is called by her proper name instead of "wench." On the other hand, Richardson substituted a more personal mode of address on fourteen occasions when Clarissa is being named. In the first edition he had allowed her family and close friends to call her occasionally "Clarissa Harlowe" or "Miss Clarissa Harlowe." He now gains greater realism by having her addressed intimately as "Clarissa" or "Clary." Richardson's effort to imitate contemporary modes of address in his fiction is also reflected in 72 changes he made from "Gentleman" and "Lady" to "man" and "woman." Many of these 72 changes identify more accurately Clarissa's middle-class background, revealing the author's scrupulous attention to the social distinctions of his time. We recall that at one point in the novel Clarissa's uncle John Harlowe describes her manners and behavior as typical of the upper classes, in contrast to Arabella's commonness: "No, it was your gentleness of heart and manners, that made every-body, even strangers, at first sight, treat you as a Lady, and call you a Lady, tho' not born one, while your elder Sister had no such distinctions paid her" (2nd ed., II, 85). Although Richardson does not alter John Harlowe's praise of his niece, he does make his second edition reflect class distinctions with greater precision. One very telling longer revision omits six lines of text that had appeared in the first edition. Clarissa had written to Anna Howe that Lovelace insists upon addressing her as Lady, even though a marriage had not yet taken place: "Lady he calls me, at every word, perhaps in compliment to himself. As I endeavour to repeat his words with exactness, you'll be pleased, once for all, to excuse me for repeating This. I have no title to it. And I am sure I am too much mortify'd at present to take any pride in that, or any other of his compliments" (1st ed., III, 94). Perhaps Richardson was most concerned that Clarissa's dwelling upon the matter belied her stated disinterest in the compliment. But consistent with this deletion, he also altered references to her as "Lady" throughout the text, changing them to words like "woman," "person," "sweet creature," "Fair-one," and others. The word "gentleman" posed a similar problem for Richardson and he solved it in essentially the same way. Richardson thought of "gentleman" not only as a word which designates a man of noble birth, but also as one which in its secondary sense describes a man whose conduct conforms to a high standard of moral excellence. How then would he designate Lovelace and his companions, whose libertine lives gave them no right to the title, though their social class did? Richardson puzzles over this contradiction even in the first edition: he has Clarissa use the term to describe Lovelace's four friends to Anna, after which she comments on the paradox it contains: "But to the gentlemen, as they must be called in right of their ancestors, it seems; for no other do they appear to have" (III, 322). Richardson did not revise this statement by Clarissa in the second edition, but he did alter one reference by her to these same men six pages later, from "four gentlemen" to "four men." Other revisions of "lady" or "gentleman" show Richardson continuing to select more strict class distinctions; at the same time he universalized moral issues that are not limited exclusively to members of one social class. Belford no longer speaks of Lovelace's "trial upon young ladies," but extends it to "young women"; Lovelace now comments on devices to "deceive a woman" not just "a lady." The "gentlewoman of the inn" at St. Albans, where Clarissa and Lovelace stop after leaving Harlowe Place, now becomes "the mistress of the house." Arabella calls Solmes "a naughty man" instead of "a naughty gentleman," and Clarissa angers her brother when she reminds him that "a young man's education" (not "a young gentleman's") should train him to reason justly and control his passions — what the university very obviously failed to do in James Harlowe's case! Perhaps to achieve elegance, and perhaps to heighten his story's tragic quality, Richardson made many changes in the diction of his characters. Colloquialisms are replaced by finer speech, and dozens of words the author newly invented are revised or eliminated. We know that Richardson encountered public criticism for his freedoms with the English language. In 1754, after the publication of Sir Charles Grandison , an anonymous pamphleteer attacked Richardson's choice of language: "That your writings have in a great measure corrupted our language and taste, is a truth that cannot be denied. The consequences abundantly shew it. By the extraordinary success you have met with, if you are not to be reckoned a classical author, there is certainly a very bad taste prevailing at present. Our language, though capable of great improvements, has, I imagine, been for some time on the decline, and your works have a manifest tendency to hasten that on, and corrupt it still farther." 11 This critic also expresses his fear that many of Richardson's "new-coin'd words and phrases" will be imitated by other writers until they are finally transferred to a dictionary by some industrious compiler, there to be sanctioned by Richardson's "great Authority." The prophecy was at least partly fulfilled quite soon, for in the very next year (1755) Dr. Johnson's dictionary came out, containing ninety-seven entries culled from Clarissa alone. 12 As an innovator, Richardson often invented new words for unusual effects ("figaries," "tostications," "precautionaries") and he manipulated standard ones in unorthodox ways. Sometimes he merely hyphenated a conventional word and placed the stressed portion in italics ("un- question -able," "unper- suade -able," "ap- pa -rent," "in- ten -tion," "oppor- tune -ly"), imitating on paper oral patterns of intonation. In other instances, he added prefixes or suffixes ("un-busy," "un-shy," "promiser-er") for expressive emphasis. He also invented compound adjectives, such as "struggled-away cheek" to incorporate the agent's action within the modifier. In 1749 Richardson revised many of these experiments. Forty-six hyphenated words like "ap- pa -rent" were standardized in the second edition by dropping hyphens and italics; newly invented nouns, like the feminine forms "survivress," "Rivalress," and "varletesses" were replaced by conventional nouns, "survivor," "Rival," and "Rogues." Clarissa now calls Betty "The confident creature" (not "The Confidence"), and she refers to her family's "dependence" upon her past good conduct (not their "dependencies"). Certain compound adjectives are also simplified: James Harlowe's "college-begun antipathy" to Lovelace becomes his "early antipathy"; Clarissa tells Lovelace that his offers to reform are just so many "anticipating concessions" instead of "stop-mouth concessions." Arabella's claim that Clarissa "next-to-bewitch'd people" becomes "half-bewitched people"; Lovelace gives Clarissa's "averted cheek" a kiss rather than her "struggled-away" one. Clarissa's closing lines to Anna are changed three times from "ever-affectionate" friend to "affectionate," and dropped one other time; "Your ever-obliged CL. HARLOWE" is changed to "CL. HARLOWE" once, and dropped altogether once. Other changes turn "over-ceremonious husband" to "ceremonious husband," "beg-pardon apologies" to "apologies," "all-excelling Sister" to "Sister, "lifted-up" to "uplifted," "over-promptitude" to "promptitude," etc. Reflecting the nobler tone of the second edition, some colorful colloquialisms are replaced with more dignified expressions. Clarissa's phrase "sooner than it agrees with my stomach" becomes "sooner than I should otherwise chuse"; "had told" becomes "had numbered." Clarissa speculates that Joseph Leman "acts a double part" between her brother and Lovelace rather than "plays booty." Lovelace speaks of "this cursed family" instead of "these cursed folks." Anna reports that her fiancé Hickman "dismounted" not "alit," and Clarissa "began to vindicate her fidelity and Love" instead of "fell a vindicating." James Harlowe storms out of Clarissa's room with "a glowing face" instead of a "face as red as scarlet." Anna speaks of Clarissa's "non-compliance" with her family's wishes instead of "standing-out." She "listened" instead of "harken'd." Clarissa insists that her "father loved me in his heart" instead of "loved me at bottom." Lovelace calls on the Devil of Love "not to frustrate my hopes" instead of "not to play me booty." He addresses Belford as the "awkward fellow" not "puppy," and as a "mortal" not a "varlet." He describes James Harlowe as "The foolish Brother" not the "Cunning whelp the brother," himself as a "bashful mortal" not a "bashful whelp." Clarissa is urged by Anna to "escape" or "withdraw" instead of "to go off." She is "in bed," not "abed." Lovelace speaks of "a high degree" not "a damn'd degree," "d-----d Art" becomes "Female Art," "a d----n'd impudent thing" becomes "an impudent Thing," although "what a d---n'd thing" remains as "what a damn'd thing." Finally, six expletives that use the name "God" or "Lord" are softened to "Heaven" ("for God's sake" to "for Heaven's sake"). Certain minor revisions are used to intensify the lines of action in the novel, and to delineate characters more pointedly. Lovelace's "faulty morals" becomes "his repeated faulty morals"; he is described as "that detested Libertine," not "that Libertine." Mr. Harlowe now is described as a "severe Father," not just an "unkind" one, and James and Arabella's 'implacableness" is changed to "antipathy." Clarissa is "so highly provoked," not "so provoked"; she goes to the "extorted interview" with Solmes, or the "apprehended interview," rather than simply "the interview." But on the other hand, Richardson also deleted modifiers: Clarissa speaks of "the subject" of marriage to Solmes, rather than "the shocking subject." She describes herself to him as a "young creature," not "a poor young creature." Betty becomes "sullen" when silenced by Clarissa, not "quite sullen," and Anna is thanked for "the pains" she took on Clarissa's behalf, not "the kind pains." Increased use of italics in the second edition highlights key words, passages, and details. This device had already been used in the first edition for emphasis, but in 1749 Richardson took even greater care to show that his heroine exercised as much precaution as possible in proposing conditions to Lovelace before leaving Harlowe Place. His Forster memorandum lists two new examples of added italics, but there are dozens of other instances — some simply one word, some much larger — that he does not identify. 13 Italics are particularly significant in the second volume, when Clarissa is relying on Lovelace's promise to put her under the protection of the ladies in his family. Each of the promises he makes to her while she is still at Harlowe Place is newly underscored to stress his later betrayal, and her innocence. In addition to these various larger patterns of changes made in the second edition, a number of specific items were altered. Richardson began to spell Dr. Lewin as Dr. Lewen; in Volume II he replaced an inaccurate allusion to Ariadne with the name Arachne, the expert weaver who challenged Athene to a contest, whose talent Lovelace compares to Clarissa's skill in embroidery. He also identifies correctly in that same volume Caesar's third wife as Pompeia (not Calpurnia), and he changes an allusion by Lovelace from Mulciber to Satan. Along with these specific corrections, he made several hundred single word changes that need to be looked at individually: "violence" to "passion," "bequeath" to "devise," "daughter" to "child," "delicate" to "polite," etc. Given these myriad small changes, what is their distinctive effect on the second edition? Is Clarissa finally a better or worse novel for these efforts in 1749? No simple answer can be formulated, for gains and losses both emerge, in great variety as well as in numbers, when the second edition is compared with its predecessor. Each text compromises some of the most attractive features of the other. It must be noted too that many small revisions, quite apart from those that clearly enhance or mar the text, neither increase nor diminish the aesthetic pleasure aroused by this novel, nor do they markedly transform this pleasure from one variety into some other kind. Such changes, being indeterminate in functional impact, need not have been made. They offer no decisive reasons for choosing either version over the other, yet they must be counted among the literal facts pertinent to any detailed study of Richardson's skill in refining his art. Even from a study of its small changes alone, it is clear that the virtues of the second edition, despite its truncated state, are several. Much of the polishing of minor matters clearly provides readers with better prose: more concrete, more precise in its meaning, more pointed in its internal references, more accurate in its use of allusion and historical example — in short, a more readable text. Happily, a fair number of awkward inventions are dropped. Not all of the words Richardson newly coined for his first edition are successful. In 1749 he weeded out many of the more infelicitous ones, as well as other distracting verbalisms and stylistic idiosyncrasies of various sorts, without sacrificing the illusion of spontaneity. It is to his credit, too, that Richardson improved the capacity of his novel to mirror more exactly the modes of address appropriate to the social strata of his day. This is fully consistent with his theory of the novel as a fiction that achieves emotional and instructive power by imitating the nexus of probabilities typical of life, by being "written to nature." Given his experiential handicap with respect to the aristocracy, this should not be taken for granted. More impressive, however, is his subtle effort to refine his art in universal terms, employing deft touches here and there to release his novel from unnecessary bondage to class distinctions. His tale of deception and sorrow transcends, even while it more carefully builds upon them, the passing accidents of birth, and certain small changes in the second edition reinforce this powerful thrust. Some freshness is sacrificed (though this loss can easily be exaggerated in a novel of such length, density, and minute detail) by still other revisions designed to improve the prose. However, corrections in grammar do not automatically spoil the refreshing verve of letters "written to the moment," nor do they necessarily render the novel's tone rigidly "formal." It is easier to see that freshness is lost in those cases where Richardson's concern for propriety led him to discard certain colorful colloquialisms, oaths, and expletives that originally added a distinct flavor to specific speeches. For good reason some were eliminated as inappropriate to the particular character speaking. Others seem to have been cut simply to raise the tone, but these, unfortunately, are not replaced by anything that secures this desired effect with comparable power or vibrancy. A major case in point is Richardson's decision to substitute "Mother"-"Father" for the more appealing terms of endearment Clarissa uses in the first edition, "mamma"-"papa." Whatever his reasons were for this change, his creative instincts failed him in this matter. His heroine thereby lost a charming dimension that had helped to humanize her. This vivid sign of her own warm-hearted affection for her parents made their cruelty more poignant to watch. Indeed, if Richardson had succeeded in transforming his grave girl more fully, endowing her with undeniable warmth as well as with tragic grace, she would be delightful to encounter. Small changes are not all he wrought, however, and I now will examine the larger revisions introduced in 1749.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii Unlike Richardson's thousands of changes in single words or small phrases, which have not been previously discussed by scholars, some of his many larger revisions have been known from his Forster memorandum, which selectively lists 102 "most Material" changes in the second edition. This document is the basis of Kinkead-Weekes' inquiry, but it was actually published as early as 1908 by Erich Poetzsche, 14 and mentioned by Sale in his bibliographical study in 1936. 15 The memorandum was probably drawn up for Richardson's own records, since he was precise in his habits both as a printer and as an author. He identifies the volume and page number for each of the 102 passages, classifying each one according to whether it is an "Addition," "Large Insertion," "Omission," etc. Sometimes he indicates his reason for making the change, such as this important entry under Volume IV, page 65 — "A large Note added, in Defense of Clarissa's Character and Delicacy." The smallest passage is one printed line of text; the largest adds more than seven pages of material by expanding an exchange of letters between Lovelace and Joseph Leman from six to thirteen pages. There is considerable diversity among these revisions, nor is Richardson's inventory by any means complete for all of the longer changes in the second edition. Counting one printed line as a minimum unit, my collation reveals there are at least 271 other changes (of one line or more) besides the 102 cited in his list. Many of these do not materially alter the structure of the plot, or significantly refine a character's feelings, actions or motivation (criteria which seem to guide Richardson's own selection in his Forster memorandum), but all of them increase our knowledge of the evolution of his text and his achievement as a craftsman. Nonetheless, certain exclusions are in order. Since some revisions, notably those about Lovelace, have been discussed by Kinkead-Weekes and others, I will not take them up. For the same reasons, I will also exclude all the "editorial" footnotes except one contemporary allusion. Most of them serve to blacken Lovelace or to defend the heroine's delicacy. 16 Their various uses of the omniscient point of view set them off as a distinctive, easily identifiable group of changes, and their aesthetic value for this novel has been the subject of controversy. Many other revisions, of the 373 that are one line or longer, are too inconsequential to need examination here. I will present a varied sampling of Richardson's changes, concentrating on those that have not been treated in print, those which seem to produce the most essential changes in important elements of this novel (e.g. character, theme, technique, style), and those which most illuminate the author's creative habits and intentions. The shaping of Lovelace and Clarissa had tested Richardson's ingenuity from the very beginning of his labors. In the case of his heroine, he struggled to achieve several purposes. Among these, he wanted her to be a faultless exemplum to young ladies. At the same time, she could not be completely perfect, or she would appear too unnatural and improbable as a girl of eighteen, not sufficiently well "written to nature," to achieve great artistic and instructive power. Both goals are explicitly stated in his surviving correspondence. As early as October 29, 1748, while the last three volumes of Clarissa were still in manuscript, he spelled out his first objective in a letter to Aaron Hill: "I had further intended to make her so faultless, that a Reader should find no way to account for the Calamities she met with, and to justify Moral Equity but by looking up to a future Reward; another of my principal Doctrines; and one of my principal Views to inculcate in this Piece." 17 A second letter to Aaron Hill one month later invites him and the women of his family to locate those passages in the novel where Clarissa seems to lack delicacy or grace: "Your Dear Ladies will be so good as to honour me with their Censure and Correction, in such places . . . where my Clarissa wants Delicacy and Female Grace. I struggled, as I may say, to give her Failings, that I might not seem to have aimed at drawing a perfect Character. But that Delicacy and Propriety of Sex, which I think to be the Sex's Glory, I wou'd not have her want." 18 In 1749, while he was preparing his second edition, he was still refining his heroine. Two remarkable revisions are designed to preserve Clarissa from any suspicion of deceit. The first edition had shown her planning a deception to forestall marriage to Solmes: "For fear they should have an earlier day in their intention, than that which will too soon come, I will begin to be very ill. Nor need I feign much; for indeed, I am extremely low, weak, and faint" (1st ed., II, 253). Clearly Richardson had tried to diminish her guilt by stressing the small scope of her intended action, but in doing so he overlooked a more troubling flaw: it is not the degree of her artifice, but her willingness to use it at all, which detracts from her innocence. Her ruse disappears in the revision: "And who knows, but they may have a still earlier day in their intention, than that which will too soon come?" (2nd ed., II, 251). A second mention of a pretended illness eight pages later was also emended. This time Richardson's transformation is even more illuminating. He does not simply drop the scheme, but adroitly turns it into a blameless new device to postpone the dreaded marriage to Solmes. Initially, the passage read: "I am far from being well: Yet must I make myself worse than I am, preparative to the suspension I hope to obtain of the menaced evil of Wednesday next" (1st ed., II, 261). It becomes, "I am really ill. And shall make the worst of my indisposition, and not the best (as I used to do, for fear of making my friends uneasy) in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next" (2nd ed., II, 259). Several revisions focus on Clarissa's responsibility for her early correspondence with Lovelace. Though her parents forbade it, there must be continued contact between their daughter and Lovelace if the tragic tale is to be set in motion. The first edition stresses her helplessness in the affair, and her own lack of choice in her actions: "But being forced into a clandestine correspondence, indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man, before I can be consulted: And between them, I have not an option, altho' my ruin [For is not the loss of reputation a ruin?] may be the dreadful consequence of the steps taken. What a perverse fate is mine" (1st ed., II, 228). Certain facts and circumstances are subtly reworked in 1749. The adjective "clandestine," with all its unmistakable connotations of deliberate illicit intrigue, is replaced by "unhappy" to direct attention to Clarissa's good intentions and unwanted misfortune. Her disobedience is also played down in the second version by adding a meritorious motive for it: "For altho' I was induced to carry on this unhappy correspondence, as I think I ought to call it, in hopes to prevent mischief; yet indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man, before I, who am so much concerned in the event of the present contentions, can be consulted: And, between his violence on one hand, and that of my relations on the other, I find myself in danger from both" (2nd ed., II, 226). A comparable refinement puts a different light on Clarissa's continued correspondence with Anna, after that too had been forbidden. Here again the problem is similar: to keep the narrative unbroken, the young ladies must remain in touch, yet the heroine must be preserved from equivocation. In the first edition, Clarissa rationalizes her action: "Yet (altho' I am ready sometimes to discontinue a correspondence so dear to me, in order to make your mamma easy) what hurt could a letter now-and-then from each do? — Mine occasionally filled with self-accusation too!" (1st ed., III, 70-71). Recast, this passage shows her willing to continue only if Mrs. Howe will renew her permission: "Yet as to this correspondence, what hurt could arise from it, if your Mother could be prevailed upon to permit it to be continued? — So much prudence and discretion as you have" (2nd ed., III, 70). Another difficulty in the novel which the author puzzled over in his early drafts is the thorny problem of Clarissa's departure from Harlowe Place with Lovelace. Richardson had written to Aaron Hill in 1746 that "Going off with a man is, moreover, the Thing I wanted most to make inexcusable; and I thought I ought not to make a Clarissa, give a Sanction to such an highly undutiful and disreputable Procedure, from any common Motives." 19 One notable revision, however, makes her unplanned flight with Lovelace more excusable, not less so. In the first edition, Clarissa had written to Anna: "I own you might well be surprised; [I was myself; as by this time you will have seen] — after I had determin'd, too, so strongly against going away" (1st ed., III, 49). The new version puts greater stress on her fixed resolve to remain at Harlowe Place, as well as her passive role in the new turn of events: "I own, that after I had told you of my absolute determination not to go away with him, you might well be surprised, at your first hearing that I was actually gone. The Lord bless me, my dear, I myself, at times, can hardly believe it is I, that have been led to take so strange a step" (2nd ed., III, 49). The same incident is also remodeled by omitting lines that present her flight negatively. In the first edition, she bluntly criticized herself when she arrived at St. Albans: "What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, by this rash action? I can now, too late, judge of the difference there is in being an offended rather than an offending person! — What would I give to have it once more in my power to say I suffer'd wrong, rather than did wrong" (1st ed., III, 50). In reshaping the passage, Richardson replaced "rash action" with the milder term "inconsiderateness," and he eliminated the line in which she implies she is an " offending person ." Although he still has her admit her responsibility, he mitigates her guilt: "What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, when I reflect upon my inconsiderateness! O that I had it still in my power to say I suffered wrong, rather than did wrong!" (2nd ed., III, 50). There is a value in looking closely at Richardson's deletions, for as he himself said as early as 1744, he was a "sorry pruner" and as "apt to add three pages for one" he took away. 20 His Forster memorandum lists six "Omissions" from the second edition; four of these, however, designate lines of verse, including Elizabeth Carter's 'Ode to Wisdom.' There are also thirty-five other deletions, from one to four lines each (but totaling only sixty-seven lines altogether), that are cut in 1749 — over and above the many individual words and phrases cited earlier in the first section of this paper. The total (sixty-seven lines scattered throughout four volumes) is relatively slight in bulk, considering that some of Richardson's individual insertions introduce as much new material into the novel at one stroke. None of his deletions concerning Clarissa is listed in his Forster memorandum. In Letter XXXIX, Volume II, Clarissa tells Anna that if Lovelace offers her protection, he must do so without any material advantage, for she will not litigate with her father over her estate: "And yet," she laments, "that I have too much pride to think of marrying, until I have a fortune that shall make me appear upon a foot of equality with, and void of obligation to, anybody" (1st ed., II, 269). Such clear concern for financial independence and social position may have seemed to Richardson incompatible with the exemplary spiritual function he wanted her to serve. He excludes these lines after the first edition. He also struck out three lines from Volume IV in which Clarissa entreats Anna for psychological support in dismissing Lovelace forever: "Do my dear, advise me, persuade me, to renounce the man for ever: And then I will for ever renounce him!" (1st ed., IV, 44). The passage suggests she is wavering, out of a more dangerous weakness for Lovelace than Richardson wished to stress in 1749 (several other alterations also bear this out); he may also have felt that Clarissa's appeal to Anna for moral counsel was excessive, unworthy of his heroine's own independent moral sense. A third instance of the author's desire to minimize Clarissa's attachment to Lovelace is his decision to omit these three lines by her to Antony Harlowe: "And is it such a crime in me, if I should prefer an acquaintance of Twelve months to one of Two?" (1st ed., I, 209). Her question is very revealing as a response to her uncle's charge that she will not consider Solmes, the new suitor proposed for her after her brother's return from Scotland, because she is prepossessed in another's favor. Richardson still let Clarissa compare the two suitors to Solmes' disadvantage, but he carefully removed her explicit confession of a preference. A fourth deletion probably reflects other reasons. Near the end of Volume IV, Lovelace fancies with pleasure the sight of Clarissa, his mistress, holding a "Twin-Lovelace" at each breast, "pressing with her fine fingers the generous flood into the purple mouths of each eager hunter by turns" (1st ed., IV, 260). The imaginative fantasy is retained in 1749, but the quoted lines are cut. One suspects that Richardson decided the robust maternal image was too earthy for his maiden heroine. Consistent with his effort to weaken Clarissa's growing affection for Lovelace in the early volumes, Richardson altered several signs of it by changing "Love" to " A conditional kind of liking ," and by eliminating some discussion of the topic (1st ed., I, 181, 252; 2nd ed., I, 182, 254). Disappointingly, the most ineffectual changes with respect to Clarissa are several newly inserted passages which simply lengthen the novel without ennobling her character or rendering it more attractive. She is given further opportunities to make moral commentaries on her own plight, to judge Lovelace more harshly, and to chide Anna anew for criticizing the Harlowe family (2nd ed., I, 179-80; III, 71-72, 207). Richardson always intended the violence of James and Arabella to lead to more and more inhuman actions by the whole family. His letter to Sarah Chapone, March 2, 1752, points out the undesirable dominance James and Arabella exert over their parents: "The Harlowes being too much influenced by their insolent and rapacious Son, joined by the instigations of an envious Daughter." 21 He had developed the vicious character of the family in the first edition, but he exploited it even more fully in 1749 by introducing fifteen details to magnify the Harlowes' evil. When Mrs. Harlowe pleads that Clarissa not be turned out of the house for refusing Solmes a visit downstairs, her son taunts his mother with this new line: "It is plain, that she relies upon her power over you" (2nd ed., I, 286). Another addition in the same volume shows James equally stubborn when he directs Mrs. Norton to report to Clarissa "That the treaty with Mr. Solmes is concluded: That nothing but her compliance with her duty is wanting" (2nd ed., I, 260). Lovelace, expert in the ways of power himself, easily recognizes that James and Arabella are determined to provoke Clarissa into some rashness, and he shrewdly sums up their characters in this added line: "tho' they had too much malice in their heads to intend service to me by their persecutions of her" (2nd ed., III, 82). Anna is also used to point up the Harlowes' evil. What can be their hope, she asks in new lines to Clarissa, " Except indeed it be to drive you to extremity, and to ruin you in the opinion of your Uncles, as well as Father " (2nd ed., II, 133). Richardson sets this comment in italics for even greater emphasis, foreshadowing the outcome of the first stage of the action of the novel, Clarissa's estrangement from her family. He also uses Anna to highlight a key feature of Arabella's character in another addition: "that meanness rises with her pride, and goes hand in hand with it" (I, 87). The longest revision that magnifies the Harlowe wickedness presents Anna's reaction to Mr. Harlowe's curse on Clarissa. In 1749, Richardson inserted two new paragraphs into Anna's Letter LIV (2nd ed., III, 266-67), described in the Forster memorandum as "much altered." Anna's new comments stress the unnaturalness of Mr. Harlowe's denunciation, which she sees as his own curse against God. She also acquires another new line in the same letter, to advertise further the family's guilt: "Can you think that Heaven will seal to the black passions of its depraved Creatures?" (2nd ed., III, 266). Even Clarissa now reveals more about her family, especially her mother, whom she formerly shielded. In consequence, they loom more blameworthy for insisting that she marry Solmes: "My Mother, my dear, tho' I must not say so, was not obliged to marry against her liking. My Mother loved my Father" (2nd ed., I, 109). Another revision shows Mrs. Harlowe participating more actively in the family evil. The original passage accented her helplessness within the family circle: "Would any-body, my dear Miss Howe, wish to marry, when one sees a necessity for such a sweet temper as my mamma's, either to be ruin'd, or depriv'd of all power" (1st ed., I, 100). The second edition stresses her culpable role, despite her own better judgment, against Clarissa: "Would any-body, my dear Miss Howe, wish to marry, who sees A Wife of such a temper, and blessed with such an understanding as my Mother is noted for, not only deprived of all power; but obliged to be even active in bringing to bear points of high importance, which she thinks ought not to be insisted upon?" (2nd ed., I, 100). His care to blacken Mrs. Harlowe is notably evident in Richardson's removal of one rare clue that she appreciates her daughter: "And now, that she has left us, so disgracefully left us! we are stript of our ornament, and are but a common family!" (1st ed., IV, 34). But even worse damage results from a long passage inserted into Anna's Letter to Clarissa of March 23 (2nd ed., II, 13-14), for it leaves no doubt that Mrs. Harlowe's human and moral qualities have withered under the hostile influence of the Harlowes throughout the years of her marriage. Anna argues that the family's effect on her is incontestable evidence of its terrible power to corrupt even the good. Finally, one addition which Richardson describes as "small, but significant" in his Forster memorandum makes Antony Harlowe look still more foolish than previously. Inserted into his courtship letter to Mrs. Howe, it expresses his views on how to handle servants: "And moreover, if we keep not servants at distance, they will be familiar. I always made it a rule to find fault, whether reasonably or not, that so I might have no reason to find fault. Young women and servants, in general (as worthy Mr. Solmes observes) are better governed by Fear than Love. But this my humour as to servants, will not affect either you or Miss, you know" (2nd ed., IV, 111). Other supporting characters also undergo revision. Lord M's garrulousness is expanded unnecessarily in Volume IV (Letter XVII) with more maxims and bits of moral counsel. Joseph Leman's letter grows more effectively from 2½ to 5 pages, from an abstract to a full-length letter in Joseph's characteristic illiterate prose (2nd ed., III, 229-233). Dolly Hervey's note that Mr. Brand will marry Clarissa omits her description of him as "the young Oxford Clergyman, and fine scholar" (1st ed., II, 295; 2nd ed., II, 292). Readers, in no position to evaluate this first clue to Brand's character, could be misled by Dolly's secondhand report. Anna assails the romantic pretensions of her mother and Antony Harlowe with more vigor (2nd ed., IV, 116), and she tries more actively to send money to Clarissa in defiance of her mother's orders (2nd ed., III, 193). This draws new chiding by Clarissa (2nd ed., III, 207), which could have been better left out. One of Richardson's finest revisions — and one wishes he had invented more of this caliber — is his expansion of a comic scene between Anna and her mother, depicted in the first edition only in bare outline: Bless me! — how impatient! — I must break off — * * * A charming dialogue — But I am sent for down in a very peremptory manner (1st ed., III, 63) Its development brings this scene amazingly alive, making us see and feel Anna's confusion as she tries to hide her letters before her mother enters: Bless me! — how impatient she is! — How she thunders at the door! — This moment, Madam! — How came I to double-lock myself in! — What have I done with the key? — Duce take the key! — Dear Madam! You flutter one so! * * * You may believe, my dear, that I took care of my Papers before I opened the door. We have had a charming dialogue — She flung from me in a passion — So—what's now to be done — Sent for down in a very peremptory manner (2nd ed., III, 62) One modest deletion enhances Hickman's character, although it cannot by itself produce the radical change Richardson desired. Richardson argues strongly in his correspondence 22 that readers are wrong to form their judgment of Hickman from the narrative points of view of Lovelace and Anna, but he nonetheless sought to improve Hickman's appeal in the second edition by striking out this slanted statement by Anna: "For Hickman appears to me to be a man of that antiquated cut; as to his mind I mean: A great deal too much upon the formal, you must needs think him to be, yourself" (1st ed., I, 174). Several contemporary or historical allusions are also revised in 1749. Richardson's footnote in the first edition explaining that "This picture [Clarissa's] is drawn as big as life by Mr. Highmore, and is in his possession" (III, 260) is omitted now; an allusion to Cromwell is also dropped "[as Cromwell said, If it must be my head, or the king's]" (III, 57); as is this reference to French royalty: "The royal cully of France, thou knowest, was Maintenon'd into it by his ill successes in the field" (1st ed., IV, 92). One new allusion, this time to English royalty, is added to Lovelace's claim that a woman will forgive almost any masculine indiscretion except public statement that she is "too old for him to attempt." The allusion supplies a confirmatory example from Renaissance history: "And did not Essex's personal reflection on Queen Elizabeth, that she was old and crooked , contribute more to his ruin, than his treason?" (2nd ed., III, 361). At least sixteen other alterations are of one kind. 23 Material written in indirect discourse is turned into the more lively format of direct speech, better able to create the illusion of letters written spontaneously. Two versions of the following passage show a typical transformation: He presumed, he told me, from what I said, that my application to my relations was unsuccessful:That therefore he hoped I would give him leave now to mention the terms in the nature of settlements, which he had long intended to propose to me; and which having till now delay'd to do, thro' accidents not proceeding from himself, he had thoughts of urging to me the moment I enter'd upon my new house; (1st ed., IV, 52) I presume, Madam, replied he, from what you have said, that your application to Harlowe-place has proved unsuccessful: I therefore hope, that you will now give me leave to mention the terms in the nature of Settlements, which I have long intended to propose to you; and which having till now delayed to do, thro' accidents not proceding from myself, I had thoughts of urging to you the moment you entered upon your new house ; (2nd ed., IV, 52) Continuing a practice already operative fourteen times in the first edition, Richardson casts one crucial scene in Volume IV (between Tomlinson, Clarissa, and Lovelace, pp. 225-28) more explicitly into dramatic form. He does so by borrowing from playwrighting the convention of prefacing each speech in a dialogue with the speaker's name. His choice is excellent for its context. Tomlinson's role, as a master of disguise serving Lovelace by deceiving Clarissa, is carried off with the flair of a well-acted stageplay that arouses new suspense. Many of the larger revisions (like most of the small ones discussed in Part I of this paper) are essentially stylistic. They range in quality, as do all of Richardson's changes, but often they clearly improve the text. Some changes transform minor passages into vivid images by adding tiny new details that further animate even sentences that were already good. As if he were auctioning off a prize heifer, James Harlowe directs Solmes' gaze toward Clarissa. In the first edition he said simply: "Look at her person! Think of her qualities! — All the world confesses them" (II, 187); but the full weight of his boorishness is more powerfully felt through this revision: "Look at her person! (and he gazed at me, from head to foot, pointing at me, as he referred to Mr. Solmes). Think of her fine qualities! — All the world confesses them" (2nd ed., II, 184). More intensity is also built into another passage that presents Clarissa waiting in silence for her mother to recognize her. It first read: "After some time, she ask'd me coldly, What directions I had given for the day?" (1st ed., I, 120). This is reworked by combining a specific temporal reference with evidence of Clarissa's anxiety: "I believe it was a quarter of an hour before she spoke to me (my heart throbbing with the suspense all the time); and then she asked coldly, What directions I had given for the day?" (2nd ed., I, 120). A final example shows, by its original and altered forms, how Richardson simplified and improved several clumsy, confusing sentences: "He was grieved at his heart, that he had so little share in my favour or confidence, as he had the mortification to find, by what I had said, he had" (1st ed., III, 36). In 1749 it is trimmed neatly to: "He was grieved at his heart, to find that he had so little share in my favour or confidence" (2nd ed., III, 35).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iii So much for a close look at a cross section of the changes in the second edition of Clarissa . To evaluate Richardson's efforts in 1749, several distinct issues must be tackled directly. Patently any claim that he revised primarily because of criticism from an audience that was sentimental, careless or superficial must be reassessed. Given the extent and range of his tiny and large revisions at this time, covering thousands of nuanced difference in tone and content, designed for very different functions, purposes and effects, it is clear that only some of them (and a rather small proportion at that) can be pinpointed with any certainty as specifically governed by his reaction to his contemporary readers. Kinkead-Weekes may be right that many of the "editorial" footnotes, and certain insertions into the text, that darken Lovelace's character and defend Clarissa's delicacy, were probably prompted by criticisms Richardson received during the long intervals between installments of his first edition. But these obvious revisions are only a small part of his total — they form only one compact group amid the thousands of instances resulting from the thorough overhauling of the first four volumes in 1749. In fact, they constitute an even smaller part of all the changes Clarissa repeatedly underwent from the time this novel was in its first manuscript form. 24 They certainly should not be treated out of proportion to their role in the entire scope of Richardson's complex endeavor. A second assumption which has clouded discussion of Richardson's revisions implies that if he introduced a certain footnote or line into his text to meet a specific criticism from his readers, he must have made all changes of the same kind for the same reason. On the contrary, each revision must be judged independently in light of its own evidence. The dangers of not doing so are visible in Philip Stevick's new version of Clarissa for the Rinehart Press. His introduction, and a footnote on page 223, indicate that his abridgement is based on the first edition, with one exception — a letter in which Lovelace describes to Belford his projected scheme to rape Anna, Mrs. Howe, and their maid, and to throw Hickman overboard, during a trip to the Isle of Wight. Stevick claims that "Richardson wrote the letter for inclusion in the revised third edition," and he explains that it serves in his abridgement to provide his readers first-hand experience with "one of the more obvious and sustained efforts Richardson made, in revising, to darken the character of Lovelace" (p. 223). Ironically, this one sample was not at all written specifically for the third edition (1751), nor can it truly exemplify even those post-publication revisions which Richardson invented in response to criticism from an adverse audience. It was written at least five years earlier and then cut from his manuscript during Richardson's struggles to shorten Clarissa for his first printing. We know it existed in the earliest versions of the novel, because it is one of the scenes that Miss Sophia Wescomb, on April 14, 1746, suggested the author might eliminate when he appealed for her help in condensing and correcting his work. 25 A third problem any editor or scholar of Clarissa must face, and face squarely, is that Richardson's changes taken as a whole are not uniformly successful, but they do reveal, as his novel does too, both his considerable strengths and his particular weaknesses as an artist. It is special pleading to set aside certain revisions that seem crude, by arguing that they do not represent his true intentions (because they are his response to an allegedly inferior audience) while others do. For better or worse, all his changes in 1749 represent his conscious and deliberate intentions as a craftsman. Indeed, they mark another important stage in a persistent practice of revising that began many years earlier. This is confirmed by the fact that some patterns of change are not confined to Clarissa alone, for they originate with his very first novel. In their thorough examination of Richardson's revisions in Pamela , Eaves and Kimpel have noted that "85 mentions of God were either cut or altered by changing the word 'God' to 'Heaven.'" 26 This, as well as other patterns that continue, shows that certain kinds of change made as early as 1741 recur in Clarissa eight and ten years later, for he altered six examples of this sort in 1749 and seven more in 1751. In other words, as a serious independent artist Richardson made certain decisions that not only transcended particular audiences and times but particular works as well. Nor did he passively rely on the many persons whose suggestions he sought. As Eaves and Kimpel have concluded from their study of the evolution of Clarissa before publication, he rarely followed most of the advice he received. 27 Lastly, it is tempting to separate the small changes from the large, give credit to the former but dismiss them as relatively unimportant, and marshal one's ammunition against the "large revisions." While it can be useful to separate these two groups for purposes of discussion, as I have done in this paper, there is no separation of them in the novel. Because they are interwoven, any theory that focuses on one group with only nodding attention to the other is headed for difficulty: it vastly oversimplifies and distorts the data relevant to a careful evaluation of Richardson's art. Quantitatively, Richardson's revisions form a continuum from the very tiny to the very large, and certain patterns of qualitative strengths and weaknesses, certain stylistic features peculiar to him, certain goals that he set himself, turn up at many different points throughout this continuum. The quality of Richardson's efforts in 1749 can also best be viewed as a continuum ranging from poor to excellent, with a subtle range of distinctions in between. Richardson did succeed in purifying his heroine of certain vexing weaknesses, and this enhances her character. But he also gave her further opportunities for moralizing and chiding. These do not warm a reader's heart, and many such signs of her character could have been more advantageously pruned from the work even in its original form. The finer distinctions introduced to harden Mrs. Harlowe against Clarissa solidify the family's opposition, completing the heroine's domestic isolation in Books I and II, with consequences that operate indirectly throughout the rest of the novel, especially during its denouement, when she is utterly alone. This subtle tightening in one important thread of his plot is certainly to Richardson's credit, for it partakes of the stuff that tragedies are made of, the pain caused by seeing a close relationship reversed, with someone suffering undeservedly as a result. In regard to that group of revisions which I have purposely excluded from my discussion because other scholars have treated them (the "editorial" footnotes and the textual insertions that expose Lovelace), it is a pity that Richardson did not trust his own better instincts to let the final installment speak for itself, without encumbering his novel with these changes. Lady Bradshaigh, like so many other readers who wrote to him throughout 1748, could not have anticipated exactly how he would bring his heroine through the ordeal of being raped, nor how he would make her death an appropriate, desired, and satisfying conclusion to his fiction. Surely he was on sound ground when he urged Lady Bradshaigh to wait until Volume V before she made up her mind about the catastrophe. "But after all," he argued, "it is the Execution must either condemn or acquit me." 28 Whatever may be his ineptitude in retouching Lovelace, it must not make us forget his fiercely creative independence in resisting the most radical request of all voiced by his readers: that he give his work a happy ending. His retouching is flawed, but this pales by comparison with his impeccable sense that the structure of a masterpiece is no arbitrary thing — probabilities of character and action must be followed out even to their stark ending in humiliation and death. His refusal to give up his catastrophe is consistent with his perceptive argument (in the Postscript to the first edition) against the widespread contemporary clamor for happy endings (VII, 428). He singled out Nahum Tate's popular script of King Lear , but his charge held for other works as well. Whether the preference to act on the English stage an altered version of King Lear is due "to the false Delicacy or affected Tenderness of the Players, or to that of the Audience," Richardson did not claim to know, but he urged that the "Public Taste" should be tried upon the original once again. Coming from one who is so often thought of as the sentimental novelist par excellence at the mid-century, this clear-eyed disenchantment with ruling fashions in taste is a pointed reminder that Richardson was as independent and surprisingly different as most great men of any age or time.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">An Annotated List of Contributions to the Boston Dial by Joel Myerson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite the commonly recognized importance of the Boston Dial , surprisingly little scholarship has been devoted to tracing its history. 1 Nineteenth-century studies are reminiscent in tone and sparse in detail; twentieth-century studies concentrate on the aesthetic or literary attitudes of the magazine and its contributors. In fact, until now no attempt has been made to provide a documented list assigning all the articles, poems, notices, and reviews in the Dial to their respective authors. The Dial was a quarterly magazine published from July, 1840, to April, 1844; 2 Margaret Fuller edited the first eight numbers and Ralph Waldo Emerson the last eight; George Ripley was business manager through the October, 1841, number and Henry David Thoreau was in charge of editing the April, 1843, number in Emerson's absence. Among its important contributors the magazine counted, in addition to its editors, Bronson Alcott, James Elliot Cabot, Ellery Channing, Lydia Child, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, George William Curtis, Charles A. Dana, John S. Dwight, Frederic Henry Hedge, James Russell Lowell, Theodore Parker, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, and Jones Very. 3 The first serious study of the Dial appeared in 1885. 4 In the July, 1885, number of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy George Willis Cooke published a brief historical account of the Dial and a tentative list of the contributors and their contributions. This list was the result of Cooke's searching through the contributors' published works, his correspondence with the contributors who were still alive, and his use of Thoreau's attributions in his set of the Dial . In 1902 Cooke expanded his article into an historical and biographical introduction which accompanied the Rowfant Club's limited edition reprint of the Dial . In the intervening seventeen years Cooke had corresponded with more contributors and had checked sets of the Dial containing the notations of Ellery Channing and Emerson. Yet his list is still inadequate: many pieces in the Dial are not listed, some entries are incorrect, and—most important—Cooke did not cite the authorities upon which he made his attributions. Since 1902 much more material has become available to scholars and it is now possible to provide a much-needed new and authoritative list of contributions to the Dial . The present list provides full documentation for assigning authors to the nearly four hundred and fifty articles, poems, and reviews in the Dial , re-assigns eighteen of Cooke's attributions, and for the first time assigns authors to thirty-two contributions omitted by Cooke from his list. 5 In assigning the authorship of each piece in the Dial the present study relies upon the following sources: 1. Extant Manuscripts . The last known location of each manuscript is given, with the following exceptions: for convenience, letters, journals, and other writings which have been responsibly edited are cited by volume and page number of the edition in which they appear. 2. Publication in Authorized Editions of the Author's Work . That is, editions published in the author's lifetime and with his knowledge and consent, or posthumous editions responsibly edited by the author's literary executors. 6 3. Attributions of Authorship in Contemporary Letters and Journals . Since not all contemporary attributions are correct, only those documents about which it is reasonably safe to assume that the writer had personal knowledge of the manuscript or had talked to the author about his or her contribution are considered trustworthy. 4. Attributions of Authorship in Copies of the Dial Owned by or Made by Contributors . Copies of the Dial containing notations by Ellery Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Emerson, Thoreau, and Samuel Gray Ward have been used. 7 Since many of these attributions of contributors were made some years after the Dial had ceased publication, they are given less weight than the preceding three sources. 5. Bibliographies and References to the Dial Published After 1844 . Since none of the books or articles in this category state the authorities for their attributions, they are used only when the question of authorship cannot be resolved by any of the above sources. Two important scholars here are James Elliot Cabot and Cooke. Cabot, Emerson's literary executor, made ascriptions based upon his extensive knowledge of Emerson's writings and the basis for his authority is self-evident.

CoH&amp;BI states that Ward furnished the author with a "list of his poems" in the Dial and by that authority Cooke assigns this poem to Ward (II, 194). 84 "To Allston's Picture, 'The Bride'" M. Fuller? Signed "O." CoJSP gives no author; M. Fuller given by ChD, CoH&amp;BI (following ChD ). However, no other evidence of M. Fuller's authorship is available and Higginson does not include this in her writings. 84 Song S. G. Ward EmBMD, EmHD, EmLCD, CoH&amp;BI (from Ward's "list of his poems," II, 194).

Ripley to Dwight, July 7, 1840, Boston Public Library. 134 A Dialogue M. Fuller FuND; ChD, EmLCD; AlcConv . Higginson appears to be in error by not listing this as among M. Fuller's writings. 135 Richter M. Fuller Life Within and Life Without , ed. Arthur B. Fuller (1859), pp. 383-84. 135 Some murmur at the "want of system" in Richter's writings M. Fuller ChD, EmHD . Although not listed by Higginson, this is probably the poem referred to in The Letters of James Freeman Clarke to Margaret Fuller , ed. John Wesley Thomas (Hamburg: Cram, de Gruyter, 1957), p. 118. 135 The Morning Breeze M. Fuller EmLCD, CoH&amp;BI (following EmLCD ). CoJSP gives no author and Higginson does not list this as among M. Fuller's writings. The images and ideas are similar to those expressed by Margaret in a letter to Elizabeth Hoar, August 17, 1839, Barrett Library of the University of Virginia Library. 136 Dante S. Clarke Signed "S." ChD, ClD, EmBMD, EmHD . 136 A Sketch [I] M. Fuller? CoH&amp;BI , Higginson. 136 A Sketch [II] M. Fuller? CoH&amp;BI , Higginson gives M. Fuller?. 136 ["Did you ever admire . . ."] M. Fuller? CoJSP gives Emerson and CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller. Neither Cabot nor Higginson assigns an author. Like the two preceding items, this was probably among the material which Margaret had to supply in order to fill up this number (see Higginson, p. 155). Volume One Number Two October 1840 137-58 Thoughts on Modern Literature R. W. Emerson Signed "E." Works , XII, 309-36. 158 Silence R. W. Emerson "Eros," Works , IX, 362. 159-60 First Crossing the Alleghanies J. F. Clarke Signed "F.C." Clarke to S. Clarke, April 7, 1840, HCL; EmL , II, 348. 161-72 A Sign from the West [review of A. Wylie, Secretarianism is Heresy ] C. P. Cranch Signed "C." ClD, EmHD, WaD . The attribution to Clarke in ChD, EmBMD, EmLCD are obviously incorrect, both because of the ClD attribution and because "F.C." or "J.F.C." were the only signatures that Clarke used in the Dial . 172 Angelica Sleeps [translated] M. Fuller? CoJSP assigns no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller?, probably because, as editor, she is most likely to have supplied filler material. EmL , II, 348, states Emerson's belief that Margaret "wrote nothing" but "The Athenæum Exhibition" article for this number, making it just possible that the attribution to J.F. Clarke in ChD is correct. 173-75 Nature and Art, or the Three Landscapes J. F. Clarke Signed "F.C." John Wesley Thomas ( James Freeman Clarke: Apostle of German Culture to America [1949], p. 86) states that he has examined the manuscripts of these poems. 175-82 The Art of Life,—The Scholar's Calling F. H. Hedge EmL , II, 348; EmBMD, EmHD . The attributions to Emerson in ChD and to Emerson? in ClD are incorrect. 183-87 Letter to a Theological Student G. Ripley Signed "R."

Record of the Months 246-47 Review of The Works of William E. Channing G. Ripley CoJSP gives Emerson? but Cabot does not list this as among Emerson's writings. EmL , II, 348; WaD; AlcConv all state that Ripley wrote the entire "Record of the Months" section, undoubtedly in reference to all of the book reviews. 248-51 Review of George F. Simmons, Two Sermons on the Kind Treatment and on the Emancipation of Slaves . . . G. Ripley [see I, 246-47] 251-56 Review of Edward Palmer, A Letter to Those Who Think G.

Select List of Recent Publications 264-65 Review of [Richard H. Dana], Two Years Before the Mast R. W. Emerson EmL , II, 348; Cabot states that it seems to be by Emerson and the reference to Robinson Crusoe in the review is contained in the letter. 265-66 Review of Albert Brisbane, Social Destiny of Man: or Association and Reorganization of Industry G. Ripley Although CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson, Cabot feels this is "doubtful." Ripley's biographer, Charles Crowe, in a letter to the present author, considers Ripley to probably be the author. Apparently Emerson first met Brisbane in late April, 1841 ( EmL , III, 19-20); Ripley, on the other hand, was much interested in associationism at this time. 266 Review of Leopold Ranke, The Ecclesiastical and Political History of the Popes of Rome . . . T. Parker? CoJSP, CoH&amp;BI give Parker as the author, probably because of the subject matter. 267-71 Review of Philip Harwood, Materialism in Religion G. Ripley CoJSP gives Emerson as the author but Cabot does not. CoH&amp;BI gives Ripley, which is probably correct. 271-72 Review of V. Cousin, Œuvres completes de Platon . . . G. Ripley CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives Ripley. Since Ripley translated Cousin in his Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature series, he probably did this review. 272 Review of Hermann Ulrici, Ueber Shakespeare's dramatische . . . M. Fuller? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . The subject seems to be ideally suited to Margaret's interests and was probably in Higginson's mind when he assigned part of the "Record of the Months" to her, although Emerson stated that she wrote only on the "Athenæum Exhibition" ( EmL , II, 348). 272 Review of Fr. Gfrörer, Das Jahrhundert das Heils, Die Heilige Sage , and Das Heiligthum und die Wahrheit T. Parker? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . The tone seems to indicate Parker, rather than the only other possible author, G. Ripley. 272 Review of F. Nork, Rabbinische Quellen . . . G. Ripley? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Assigned here to Ripley primarily because he was in charge of the "Record of the Months." Volume One Number Three January 1841 273-89 Man in the Ages T. T. Stone Signed "S."

EmL , II, 380. 312-13 To Nydia J. F. Clarke At the time, Emerson wrote that Clarke was the author, "I think" ( EmL , II, 380); ClD, EmBMD, EmHD, EmLCD, WaD . 314 The Violet E. L. T.

Record of the Months 401-2 Review of John Edward Taylor, Michael Angelo, Considered as a Philosophic Poet . . . M. Fuller? CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson as the author, probably because of Emerson's life-long interest in Michelangelo, and this book may possibly have been the "book about Michel Angelo" which Emerson mentioned in EmL , II, 406. However, Cabot feels Emerson's authorship to be "doubtful" and this review was probably in Higginson's mind when he gave M. Fuller as the author of the "Record of the Months." Neither the style nor the ideas seem to be Emerson's. Select List of Recent Publications 401-4 Review of Samuel D. Robbins, The Worship of the Soul G. Ripley? CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson but Cabot believes this to be "doubtful." M. Fuller did not review religious works. This review was probably in Alcott's mind when he said that Ripley did the "Record of the Months" ( AlcConv ). 404-5 Review of B. Rodman, A Voice from the Prison . . . M. Fuller CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller, probably following Higginson's statement that Margaret did the "Record of the Months." Prison reform was long an interest of Margaret's. 405 Review of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Grandfather's Chair M. Fuller CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller, probably following Higginson as mentioned in I, 404-405. Since Margaret did the other reviews of Hawthorne in the Dial , this one is also probably by her. 405-6 Review of Krummacher, The Little Dove M. Fuller? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Probably by M. Fuller, whose interests and style it most closely approximates. 406 Review of Knight's Miscellanies M. Fuller? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Probably by M. Fuller, following Higginson. 406 Review of Nichol, Architecture of the Heavens, The Solar System , and The Structure of the Earth M. Fuller? [see I, 406 ( Knight )] 408 Review of Daub's philosophische und theologische Vorlesungen . . . G. Ripley? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . AlcConv is probably correct in thinking this to be part of Ripley's contribution to the "Record of the Months." The subject is one that M. Fuller would not normally take up. There is a slight chance, based on the subject matter, that T. Parker wrote this. 408 Review of Ludwig Wachler, Franz Passow's Leben und Briefe G. Ripley [see I, 408 ( Daub )] Volume One Number Four April 1841 409-43 The Unitarian Movement in New England W. D. Wilson CoH&amp;BI , on the authority of a letter from Wilson (II, 194); the attribution to G. Ripley in ChD is incorrect. 443-45 Dream J. F. Clarke Clarke to S. Clarke, April 7, 1840, HCL; Clarke-Fuller Letters , p. 138; ClD . J.S. Dwight was incorrectly entered as the author in ChD but later crossed out. 446-61 Ideals of Every-Day Life. No. II. J. S. Dwight Signed "D." EmL , II, 380. 461 Listen to the Wind E. S. Hooper? CoJSP gives E.S. Hooper?; ChD, CoH&amp;BI (following ChD ) give C. Sturgis. ClD states that E.S. Hooper was the author and is probably correct, both since Clarke knew Mrs. Hooper better than Channing did, and since Clarke's other attributions to E.S. Hooper are all correct while Channing's are often wrong. 461 The Wind Again C. Sturgis? CoJSP gives E.S. Hooper?; ChD, CoH&amp;BI (following ChD ) give C. Sturgis. In this case Channing does seem to be right, for the poem does resemble C. Sturgis's style more than it does Mrs. Hooper's. 462-67 Leila M. Fuller ChD, EmBMD, EmHD, EmLCD, ThD . 468-69 Poems on Art.

EmLCD states that G.W. Curtis is the author, but Curtis to Cooke, n.d. ( CoH&amp;BI , II, 170), clearly indicates that Emerson was in error. 53-55 Need of a Diver M. Fuller? CoJSP , Higginson give M. Fuller; CoH&amp;BI states, probably following ChD , that W.H. Channing is the author. However, Frothingham ( W.H. Channing ) does not assign this piece to Channing. In this instance, Higginson must be considered more trustworthy than ChD , although the fact that this piece was never reprinted in M.

CoJSP, CoH&amp;BI give no author; "BF" in EmBMD is probably an incomplete "BFP[resbury]", the author of the poems immediately before and after this one, which Emerson failed to cross out after he became aware of his error.

Fuller Higginson assigns no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller, which must be assumed correct both because of the subject matter and the tone of the review. 395-99 Review of Monaldi, a Tale M.

Fuller See Clarke-Fuller Letters , p. 41; Higginson. 407-8 Boston Academy of Music M. Fuller Higginson, CoJSP assign no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M.

Fuller [see II, 407-408] 408 Review of The Ideal Man E. P. Peabody? CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson but Cabot feels this is "doubtful." Higginson does not assign the review to M. Fuller. The review is introduced as being inserted at "the request of a friend." Since the book was published by E.P. Peabody, it is possible that she wrote the review, since she often did write notices for her other books. Emerson's authorship is highly unlikely. Volume Two Number Four April 1842 409 To the Editor of the Dial A. B. Alcott Letter, signed "A. Bronson Alcott." 409-37 Days from a Diary A. B. Alcott Signed "A.B.

Marianne Dwight Jackson, a Brook Farm resident, is given in ChD as the author. There is a slight possibility that this was translated by some of Margaret's pupils under her supervision. 483-85 Silence and Speech C. P. Cranch Signed "C."

Emerson Although both CoH&amp;BI and EmHD give Emerson?, and Cabot does not mention this as among Emerson's writings, the evidence in EmL , III, 102, and Kenneth Walter Cameron, "Emerson, Thoreau, and the Town Athenaeum," in his The Transcendentalists and Minerva (1958), III, 890-92, make Emerson's authorship fairly certain. 131 Review of G. Oegger, The True Messiah . . . R. W. Emerson? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. While it is just possible that this is one of T. Parker's reviews which Emerson had on hand (see Parker to Emerson, May 16, 1842, HCL, and EmL , III, 68), more likely the notice is by Emerson, who had just begun as editor. 131 Review of Günderode R. W. Emerson? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. Emerson, as editor, may have written this to promote the sale of M. Fuller's book. 132 Notice of O. A. Brownson, A Letter to Rev. W. E. Channing R. W. Emerson Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI ; see EmJMN , VIII, 484. The notice promises a review in the next number by "a correspondent," probably Elizabeth Peabody (see EmL , III, 63-64). 132 Notice of Novalis, Henry of Ofterdingen R. W. Emerson? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Probably by Emerson, as editor (see possibly EmJMN , VIII, 484-85), although the book would also have been of interest to M. Fuller and the notice may possibly have been among the materials which Emerson inherited from her when he took over the Dial (see Emerson to L. M. Child, January 8, 1844, Pierpont Morgan Library). 132 Notice of Caroline Southy, Chapters on Church Yards R. W. Emerson? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Probably by the editor; see EmJMN , VIII, 484. 132 Notice of The London Phalanx , June R. W. Emerson Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . Probably an exchange paper, the issue arrived too late to make M. Fuller the author; see EmJMN , VIII, 484. Intelligence 132-33 Exploring Expedition R. W. Emerson CoJSP gives no author; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson and is probably the authority for the attribution to Emerson in CoH&amp;BI . 133 Association of State Geologists R. W. Emerson EmHD ; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson; see also EmJMN , VIII, 484. 133-34 Harvard University R. W. Emerson EmHD ; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. 135 [William Wordsworth] R. W. Emerson ThD ; EmHD gives Emerson?; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. 135 [Tennyson] R. W. Emerson Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. That this piece of information came from C.S. Wheeler, an old friend of Emerson's, makes his authorship almost certain. 135 [Henry Taylor, John Sterling, Carlyle] R. W. Emerson CoJSP , CoH&amp;BI ; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. The information was probably drawn from Emerson's correspondence with Sterling and Carlyle. 136 Berlin R. W. Emerson EmHD , ThD ; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. 136 New Jerusalem Church R. W. Emerson CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. Since the information is from an exchange paper, and since the "Intelligence" section was originally Emerson's idea, in all probability he was the author (see also EmJMN , VIII, 484).

This poem is listed with "Saadi" in the table of contents to volume three as being on pp. 265-69 and therefore, although both EmLCD and ChD have R.W. Emerson next to the entry, actually only "Saadi" is being referred to. G. W. Curtis is listed as the author in EmBMD , but Curtis to Cooke, n.d. ( CoH&amp;BI , II, 170), makes this seem unlikely.

However, EmL , III, 90, and a copy of the review corrected in Margaret's hand in her "Journal Vol. III," HCL, make her authorship certain. 276-77 Review of O. A. Brownson, A Letter to Rev. Wm. E. Channing R. W. Emerson? CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. EmL , III, 63-64, seems to indicate that Emerson is the author, although it is barely possible that E. P. Peabody wrote the review (see the discussion of this book for III, 132, above). 277-78 Review of William Smyth, Lectures on Modern History . . . T. Parker?

Emerson (see also EmJMN , V, 165), CoH&amp;BI is probably correct in giving Thoreau (see ThJ , I, 251, 264, 279, and ThCor , p. 68). 340-42 Death W. E. Channing Poems (1843), pp. 135-40. 343-62 The Life and Character of Dr. Follen [review of Follen, Works of . . ., and Memoir of his Life ] T. Parker Signed "P." See Parker, "Journal," II, 1, Unitarian Universalist Association, Boston; EmL , III, 87. 363-86 The Prometheus Bound [translation] H. D. Thoreau Signed "H.D.T." See Emerson to C.S.

Undoubtedly written by Emerson from an exchange paper. 387 [Introductory Note to "Letter from Germany"] R. W.

H. Hedge See Emerson to C.S. Wheeler, February 3, 1843, HCL; EmL , III, 97-98. Record of the Months 404-6 Review of Life of Jean-Paul Frederic Richter . . . Translated from the German M. Fuller? Cabot does not assign this to Emerson; Higginson does not assign this to M. Fuller; CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?. Although Emerson definitely read this book (see EmL , III, 92, and EmJMN , VIII, 267), his personal feelings about Richter are often at odds with those expressed in the review. The reviewer, who says that Richter is his "favorite author," is probably M. Fuller, who had earlier promised to do the reviews for this number ( EmL , III, 9on). 406-11 Review of An Essay on Transcendentalism C. Lane CoH&amp;BI ; the tone and style of the review both closely resemble Lane's writing. 411-13 Review of Letters of Schiller . . ., trans. J. L. Weisse R. W. Emerson? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R. W. Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. The review could possibly be by M. Fuller, but no firm evidence is available and the piece is not assigned to her by Higginson. 413-14 Review of Fables of La Fontaine , trans. Elizur Wright, Jr. R. W. Emerson? [see III, 411-13] 414-15 Review of Confessions of St. Augustine R. W. Emerson ThD ; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson. 415 Notice of Cornelius Mathews, The Career of Puffer Hopkins R. W. Emerson? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI ; probably written by Emerson, as editor. 415 Notice of H. W. Longfellow, Poems on Slavery M. Fuller? Not listed by CoJSP or CoH&amp;BI . The tone of this notice of the "thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow's thin books" coincides with Margaret's own negative feelings about Longfellow. 416 Notice of the Lowell Offering , December R. W. Emerson? [see III, 415 (Mathews)] 416 [English Books] R. W. Emerson CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings, but it is surely Emerson's account of the many books which A.B. Alcott had been sending him from England. 416 Goethe and Swedenborg R. W. Emerson CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?; Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings, but the tone and subject matter make his authorship seem certain. Volume Three Number Four April 1843 417-54 A.

Emerson?, which is probably correct (see possibly EmJMN , VIII, 167). Record of the Months 532 Review of Frederika Bremer, The Neighbors M. Fuller? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?, but Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. This is probably part of the "Record of the Months" which Higginson says that Margaret did. For Margaret's probable authorship, see also EmL , III, 147. 532-33 Review of E. L. Bulwer, The Last of the Barons R. W. Emerson? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?, but Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. The thoughts are similar to those Emerson expressed in "Europe and European Books" (III, 518-20). 533-34 Review of Francis James Festis, Music Explained M. Fuller CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives M. Fuller?. The topic is congenial to Margaret's tastes and this review is probably part of the "Record of the Months" credited to her by Higginson; see also EmJMN , VIII, 529. 534-35 Review of George Borrow, The Bible in Spain . . . R. W. Emerson CoJSP gives R.W. Emerson?; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson; Cabot says that this seems to be by Emerson, who had earlier reviewed Borrow's Zincali for the Dial . 535 Review of Robert Browning, Paracelsus M. Fuller? CoJSP gives R.W. Emerson?; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson, but Cabot feels that this is "doubtful." Although Emerson did read this book, his journal entries ( EmJMN , VIII, 302-304) do not point towards his authorship. For Margaret's probable authorship, see Louise Greer, Browning and America (1952), pp. 218-23. This review is probably part of the "Record of the Months" assigned to Margaret by Higginson. 535 Review of Heinrich Zschokke, The Sleep Walker M. Fuller? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson?, but Cabot does not include this as among Emerson's writings. The book deals with "animal magnetism," or hypnotism, which was an interest of Margaret's, and this may be among the "Record of the Months" which Higginson assigned to her. 536-40 Review of John A.

Emerson is listed in EmLCD and strong supporting evidence is in Arthur Christy, The Orient in American Transcendentalism (1932), pp. 306-312, and in Frederic Ives Carpenter, Emerson and Asia (1930), p. 223. 62 Spring W.

Emerson CoJSP does not say who selected the poem; CoH&amp;BI assigns Emerson?; EmLCD states only "Leigh Hunt". For Emerson's interest in this poem, see EmJMN , VIII, 174. 63 The Song of Birds in Spring W. E. Channing? CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives W.E.

Thoreau, but Emerson's greater familiarity with this work (see EmJMN , VIII, 146, 354, 366-67, 383, 410) makes him the probable author, although Thoreau might have made the selections, using Emerson's copy of the book. 210 Via Sacra C.

Percival, The Dream of a Day, and Other Poems R. W. Emerson? CoH&amp;BI gives R.W. Emerson, but Cabot feels that Emerson's authorship is "doubtful." Many of the ideas, and especially the comments on W.C. Bryant, are close to Emerson's own. 272 [Notices of Books] R. W. Emerson CoH&amp;BI gives R.W.

EmLCD. CoJSP , CoH&amp;BI give H. D. Thoreau, who may have made the selections, but the Hermes section was undoubtedly the same as that which A.B. Alcott sent to Emerson in August, 1842 (Alcott, Letters , p. 88), and which Emerson promised in the October Dial to print in the future (III, 278). Emerson had a life-long interest in Saadi.

Although Higginson does not assign this to Margaret, the evidence in EmL , III, 230, and Emerson to L.M. Child, January 8, 1844, Pierpont Morgan Library, strongly support her claim of authorship. 407 Review of L. M. Child, Letters from New York M. Fuller CoJSP gives no author; CoH&amp;BI gives R. W. Emerson?, but Cabot does not include it as among Emerson's writings. The tone is unlike Emerson's; the writer could possibly be C.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Dial's history can best be traced through Cooke's two studies (cited below) and my 1971 Northwestern University doctoral dissertation, "A History of the Dial (1840-1844)," which I am currently revising for book publication. An excellent article by Burton R. Pollin, "Emerson's Annotations in the British Museum Copy of the Dial," Studies in Bibliography , 24 (1971), 187-95, discusses the Harvard and British Museum sets of the Dial containing Emerson's annotations. I am grateful to Professor Pollin for kindly supplying me with information concerning the British Museum's Dial . 2 The Dial was published by Weeks, Jordan and Company (July, 1840-April, 1841), W. H. S. Jordan (July, 1841), Jordan &amp; Co. (October, 1841), E. P. Peabody (January, 1842-April, 1843), and James Munroe and Co. (July, 1843-April, 1844). 3 The maiden names of Margaret [Fuller] Ossoli and Caroline [Sturgis] Tappan are retained throughout because neither was married until after the Dial had ceased publication. 4 Alcott's Conversation on the Dial in the Boston Commonwealth was very incomplete in listing facts about the magazine and its contributors, as was his "Reminiscences of the Transcendental Club," ( Boston Book Bulletin , 1 [December, 1877], 3-5, [March, 1878], 30). George William Curtis's "Mr. Emerson and the 'Dial'" ( Literary World [Boston], 11 [May 22, 1880], 178) was a slap-dash affair put together for a special Emerson issue and is of little value. Cooke's list was originally intended to accompany a reprint of the Dial planned by Roberts Brothers in 1882 but when only half of the two hundred subscribers needed to insure its financial success responded, the project was abandoned (see "A Reprint of 'The Dial,'" Journal of Speculative Philosophy , 16 (1882), 329-31, which reprints Roberts Brothers's prospectus, and Raymond L. Kilgour, Messrs. Roberts Brothers Publishers [1952], pp. 132, 198). 5 The majority of these last two items are reviews and notices. My purpose throughout has been to provide a newly and independently researched annotated list of contributions to the Dial ; my results in most instances agree with the attributions of Cooke and Cabot, both of whose work I am indebted to. 6 However, since this list does not attempt to locate all reprints of material in the Dial , only those subsequent printings of Dial material which help to ascertain authorship are listed. For example, when a lecture by Emerson is printed by the Dial and he is clearly given there as the author, I did not feel it necessary to also list another printing of it in his Works . 7 With the exception of Emerson's annotations in the Library of Congress's copy, attributions by contributors are made throughout their copies of the Dial . I have personally examined all copies, with these exceptions: a microfilm of Ellery Channing's set was used; a Xerox of the table of contents of the Library of Congress's set was used; a Xerox of the table of contents of the British Museum's set, supplemented by information in Pollin, "Emerson's Annotations in the British Museum Copy of the Dial ," was used. Professor Pollin reports most of Emerson's attributions but since it was not his purpose to report all of them, I have used the original sources as the basis for my own list.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Periodical Literature of English and American Bibliography by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although it is true in most fields of knowledge that new discoveries are often announced first in periodical articles and only later consolidated into more comprehensive books, this situation is particularly characteristic of bibliography. Given the nature of the subject, many contributions inevitably consist of brief notes or articles on individual copies of a book, providing facts which supplement a previously published bibliography or which augment the accumulated evidence about a given printing or publishing practice. As time passes and a sizable body of information develops, a new book, drawing the scattered material together, may be called for; but until that time, those periodical pieces represent the current state of knowledge. Perhaps the classic instance in the field of bibliography is McKerrow's Introduction to Bibliography (1927), which has been the standard guide for over forty years but which has naturally (and increasingly) required supplementing by reference to current research as reported in the journals. Obviously a cumulated index to periodical articles is an essential reference tool in any field, but the surprising thing about bibliography is what little effort has been made, until recently, to provide this kind of coverage. 1 When Studies in Bibliography included in its third volume a "Selective Check List of Bibliographical Scholarship" for 1949, it was inaugurating what was to become one of its most important services to bibliographers—a listing of the principal contributions of each year, including separately published monographs as well as articles in periodicals. That service has now covered more than twenty years' work and has twice been provided with cumulative indexes (in the separate issue of the lists for 1949-55 and for 1956-62), making it even more convenient to consult. One has no complaint, therefore, about the indexing of bibliographical articles from 1949 on—though the SB lists cannot hope to be complete and do not try to be (they are called "Selective Check Lists"). It may therefore be necessary in certain kinds of bibliographical research to consult other general indexes for items not included (such as a brief history of a publishing firm in Publishers' Weekly or a book review on a bibliographical subject), 2 but these lists do an outstanding job of recording what can sensibly be called "scholarship" and have caused 1949 to be regarded as the great dividing line by anyone in the process of searching out bibliographical articles. 3 For the period before 1949 a few guides to bibliographical work exist, but they are not comparable to the SB lists in coverage of periodical material on English and American books. The principal one is probably the series of current lists 4 which have appeared in the Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen since its inception in 1884; though the emphasis is on separate publications, especially those relating to libraries, the lists do contain some English and American articles. For the periods 1904-12 and 1922-26 annual (and indexed) cumulations, issued under the title Bibliographie des Bibliotheks- und Buchwesens (1905-27), make these lists easier to consult; and the expanded cumulation which followed, the Internationale Bibliographie des Buch- und Bibliothekswesens [ IBBB ] (1928-41), covering 1926-40, is particularly useful, since it includes about two dozen prominent English-language journals, such as the Library , the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America [ PBSA ], Publishers ' Weekly , Publishers ' Circular , and Penrose Annual . Similarly, Library Literature surveys a field which overlaps bibliography, and it indexes—besides a great many library periodicals, as would be expected—the Library , PBSA , Publishers' Weekly , and Publishers' Circular . 5 In addition, a selection of English and American items can be located in the "Bibliography" section of the Modern Humanities Research Association's Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature (1921- ), with coverage from 1920, and in the sections on printing, publishing, periodicals, and book arts in Writings on American History (covering 1902-03, 1906-40, 1948-57; published 1904-64), Writings on British History (covering 1901-45; published 1937-68), Bibliography of British History (1928- ), and Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (1940, 1957, 1969- ). Other cumulative lists which may yield additional periodical material include E. C. Bigmore and C. W. H. Wyman's great Bibliography of Printing (1880-86); Talbot B. Reed's "A List of Books and Papers on Printers and Printing, under the Countries and Towns to Which They Refer," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 3 (1895-96), 81-152; George T. Watkins's Bibliography of Printing in America (1906); Clark S. Northup's A Register of Bibliographies of the English Language and Literature (1925); Nathan Van Patten's An Index to Bibliographies and Bibliographical Contributions Relating to the Work of American and British Authors, 1923-1932 (1934); Alan R. Eager's A Guide to Irish Bibliographical Material (1964); T. H. Howard-Hill's Index to British Literary Bibliography (1969- ); and G. T. Tanselle's Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (1971). 6 Even after checking these lists, a bibliographer still cannot be sure that he is drawing from a reservoir containing all the articles in all the principal bibliographical journals of the period. What he must do, to come closer to this goal, is to consult several further kinds of index. One is the guide to articles in a specified group of bibliographical journals. The best-known of these is George Watson Cole's excellent Index to Bibliographical Papers Published by the Bibliographical Society and the Library Association (1933), covering the period 1877-1932—essentially an index to the Bibliographical Society's Transactions (1893-1920), the Library (1889-1932), Bibliographica (1895-97), and the Library Association Record (1899-1929). A successor to this index is Michael Turner's forthcoming "Bodleian Index to Certain Bibliographical Journals," which will cover, from 1933 through 1965, the Library , PBSA , Studies in Bibliography , Book Handbook , Book Collector , and Bibliotheck , as well as the publications of the bibliographical societies of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. Another kind of index, which can be used to supplement both of these works, is the cumulative index to a single periodical—such as that for PBSA (as of 1931 and 1951) and for the Bulletin of the New York Public Library (as of 1936, 1946, and 1962). 7 Cumulative indexes before 1942 can be located through Daniel C. Haskell's A Check List of Cumulative Indexes to Individual Periodicals in the New York Public Library (1942). 8 Finally, one can turn to the general periodical indexes, most of which cover at least a few journals of bibliographical interest. Poole's Index , for example, covers the early years of the Library and Library Journal , along with the Bibliographer, Bibliographica , and such other late nineteenth-century journals as Book-Lore , Bookworm , and the American Bibliopolist . For the twentieth century, the Readers ' Guide indexes Publishers ' Weekly and several of the library periodicals, while the Social Sciences and Humanities Index (formerly International Index ) includes, during part of its run, PBSA and the Library , as well as Colophon , Library Quarterly , Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , and a few other periodicals with occasional bibliographical material. The Annual Magazine Subject Index 9 also takes up PBSA and the Library , plus certain library journals and a number of typographical publications, such as Printing Art , Print , and Graphic Arts . The central group of library journals is again surveyed in the Internationale Bibliographie der Zeitschriftenliteratur [ IBZ ], along with Publishers ' Weekly , Publishers ' Circular , the Library , and, for a few years, American Printer , British Printer , and Printing Art ; in recent years the coverage of IBZ has been so enormous (now roughly 13,000 periodicals) that one might expect more bibliographical journals to be included—indeed, there are considerably more of them in recent years—but for the pre-1949 period the IBZ is not markedly richer in bibliographical material than the other periodical indexes. Similarly, the British Humanities Index (formerly Subject Index to Periodicals ), aside from a dozen or so library journals, records only a few bibliographical journals—the Library and PBSA , the publications of the bibliographical societies of Oxford and Glasgow, and—only after the beginning of the SB lists— Signature , Typographica , Penrose Annual , and Book Collector . Although there is much overlapping of coverage among these periodical indexes, 10 and although many bibliographical journals are not covered in them at all, they are worth checking, since stray articles of a bibliographical nature can always turn up in some of the general magazines indexed in them. One could go on making further suggestions for tracking down articles, but the point is clear: for pre-1949 material, no one index to bibliographical literature provides a counterpart to the SB lists, and, if one wishes to approximate the SB coverage, one must make a time-consuming check of a number of lists. Periodical indexes can of course be constructed in either of two ways—as an attempted record of all material, wherever published, that is relevant to a given subject, or as a survey of a specified list of journals. Of the indexes mentioned here, Library Literature and the guides to historical writings are good examples of the subject approach, while the standard general periodical indexes are examples of indexes based on fixed groups of journals. Since the subject areas covered—such as librarianship and printing—are less broad than the whole field of bibliography and since the bibliographical journals covered in the general indexes naturally represent only a selection from the full range of bibliographical periodicals, neither group of presently existing indexes provides a really satisfactory control of serial bibliographical material before 1949. Of course, persons interested primarily in a particular author will find bibliographical articles gathered together with other material about that author in each year's issue of the MLA International Bibliography and the MHRA Annual Bibliography and in other guides to literary scholarship. But the fact that bibliographical articles do get listed in this way does not mean that a listing devoted exclusively to bibliographical articles is superfluous—an article on a particular writer, for example, may employ an unfamiliar bibliographical technique, and the bibliographical importance of the article may not be as readily recognized if it is not recorded in a bibliographical context. There is simply no substitute for a serial listing which takes bibliography as its field of knowledge. The SB lists are important because they do more than cover a limited list of periodicals; instead, they try to include all the significant scholarship in physical bibliography, wherever it happens to appear, and, in doing so, they provide a means for measuring the growth of bibliographical knowledge at the same time that they furnish a tool which facilitates the further accumulation of that knowledge. 11 Since there is no real counterpart for the period before 1949, it becomes particularly important to be aware of the main bibliographical journals of the period and of the places (if any) where each is indexed. Surveying the journals which might reasonably be expected to publish bibliographical material is complicated, however, by the variety of fields and publications that are related to the study of the book in its broadest sense—ranging from the scholarly papers of bibliographical societies to the trade journals of the printing industry. While a journal of librarianship may not very often have an article relevant to physical bibliography and while a book-trade magazine may not usually publish anything that could be called scholarship, both are undeniably sources of information which may be helpful to bibliographers. The most extensive convenient listing of these journals is Carolyn F. Ulrich and Karl Küp's Books and Printing: A Selected List of Periodicals , 1800-1942 (1943); its thousands of entries show the great extent of this literature and provide a place where one can turn for the names of lesser-known journals relevant to all aspects of book production. 12 Because I had occasion, in preparing my Guide to the Study of United States Imprints , to examine the indexing of these varieties of journals somewhat more systematically than I had done before, and perhaps more systematically than bibliographers generally have time to do, I thought it might prove useful to draw this information together in concise form. Accordingly, I shall make some comments in the following pages on the indexing of five classes of periodicals: 13 journals of bibliographical societies (and related scholarly bibliographical journals of a general nature); book-collecting journals; magazines dealing with printing and typography; trade journals of the publishing industry (or other industries—aside from printing—related to the production or distribution of printed books); and library journals (both general periodicals and those associated with particular libraries). Following these discussions is a table surveying more precisely the coverage of the principal journals in the nine most prominent relevant indexes. 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Bibliographical Society Journals The organs of bibliographical societies naturally constitute the central group of journals for bibliographical study, both because they are scholarly in approach and because they are not usually limited to any one aspect of the book. The Library , the publication of the Bibliographical Society (London), has the most distinguished history of any such journal, for even before it became officially connected with the Bibliographical Society in 1920 it was oriented as much toward physical bibliography as toward librarianship and was publishing the work of Pollard, Plomer, and Greg. Even though it was not a bibliographical society journal from 1889 through 1919, therefore, it deserves a place in this group as a general scholarly journal of bibliography. Because of its importance, it has probably been indexed more times than any other bibliographical journal: its entire run is covered in Library Literature ; the Cole and Turner indexes cover it through 1965; the IBZ takes it from 1911 forward; and practically all the other major periodical indexes treat substantial segments of it. Before the Bibliographical Society took over the Library , it published its Transactions (1893-1919) separately, and they, too, are covered both in Library Literature and in Cole. 15 The principal American journal, the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America (1904- ), is much less satisfactorily indexed in these guides: although it turns up in a number of indexes, the periods involved are so scattered that, in order to cover the pre- SB years (other than in PBSA 's own cumulative indexes), 16 one must consult at least two different indexes ( Library Literature for 1904-14 and the Annual Magazine Subject Index for the remaining years through 1949). Studies in Bibliography , the other major bibliographical journal in English, has not been extensively indexed in the general indexes, 17 but there is no problem in locating its contents since it is obviously included in the annual lists of scholarship which it publishes. Of the remaining journals of local bibliographical societies—principally the bibliographical societies of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Wales—the years from 1933 on are taken care of in Turner's forthcoming index, but the earlier years are only haphazardly covered. The Subject Index is the best that one can do for this purpose, since it includes the Glasgow society as of 1912, the Welsh as of 1915, and the Oxford as of 1926. Bibliographical societies such as those of Cambridge, Canada, and Australia and New Zealand, whose publications began after 1948, are of course included in the SB checklist, but the earlier publications of the Bibliographical Society of Ireland are not listed in any of the basic indexes. Finally, a few other general journals, technically not organs of bibliographical societies, belong in this group. The most illustrious early one, Bibliographica (planned from the beginning to last only three years, 1895-97, and full of contributions by Pollard, Plomer, Madan, Proctor, and Redgrave), is completely indexed in Cole; the Bibliographical Register (1905-07), significant if not equally important, does not appear in the lists of any of the standard indexes; the Gutenberg Jahrbuch (1926- ), which over the years has contained many important articles in English on all aspects of bibliography, is not adequately covered in the periodical indexes, not even appearing in IBZ until 1963 (the first fifteen years are indexed in IBBB , but a gap of over twenty years still remains); and the Bibliotheck , containing much valuable Scottish material, only began in 1956 and is recorded in SB . The situation can therefore be summarized in this way: for the pre- SB years, Turner's index takes care of most of the bibliographical society journals back to 1933; but for the years before that, aside from Cole's coverage of the few major English publications, the indexing of these journals—including such important ones as PBSA and Gutenberg Jahrbuch —is either confusingly spread over several indexes or nonexistent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Book-Collecting Journals The other principal category of general bibliographical journals consists of those ostensibly directed toward an audience of book collectors. They are not necessarily less scholarly, and indeed many of them are notable for their learned commentary. Thus the dividing line between this category and the previous one is not distinct; but it makes some sense, for purposes of classification, to separate those journals associated with book collecting—by virtue of their title, their content, or their sponsoring organization—from those journals associated with bibliographical societies. In practice, of course, the two groups together constitute the central core of general journals in the field of bibliography. The principal book-collecting journal in English at present, the Book Collector , illustrates the point, for its editorials, bibliographical descriptions, notes and queries, and reviews maintain a high scholarly standard. Because it began in 1952—that is, after the start of the SB checklists—there is no problem about its indexing; but part of the run of its predecessor, Book Handbook (1947-52), appeared before the SB coverage, as did all of Bibliographical Notes and Queries (1935-39), the forerunner of the notes and queries section of the Book Collector —and while Book Handbook is indexed in Turner, Bibliographical Notes and Queries is unfortunately not indexed anywhere. In fact, the indexing of book-collecting journals in general is extremely sparse, with only a few of the important ones receiving even fragmentary coverage. Thus one can go to the English Subject Index for nearly all (1919-30) of the Bookman's Journal and Print Collector and for a small segment (1915-22) of the Irish Book Lover ; to the IBBB for most (1930-34) of Desmond Flower and A. J. A. Symons's Book Collector's Quarterly and for Charles F. Heartman's American Book Collector (1932-35); to the International Index for part (1934-39) of the Colophon ; and to Library Literature for the New Colophon (1948-50) and part (1936-39) of the Book Collector's Packet . But even after consulting four indexes, one has only partial coverage of most of the journals included and no coverage at all of such landmarks as Paul Leicester Ford's Bibliographer (1902-03), Heartman's American Collector (1925-28), the Limited Editions Club's Dolphin (1933-41), and the publications of the Grolier Club, the Book Club of California, and the Zamorano Club ( Hoja Volante ). As for the numerous book-collecting journals which flourished around the turn of the century, their contents may now be outdated, but the best of them contained a great amount of material which is still useful—if for no other reason—as a source of information about individual copies of books; this material certainly deserves to be made accessible through a consolidated index. Yet of all these periodicals, only Wheatley's Bibliographer (later Book-Lore , then Bookworm ) is included in a standard index (Poole). 18 A thorough index to bibliographical literature should also cover at least Bibliomane (later Bibliophile and Book-Worm ; 1881-94), Book Lovers' Almanac (1893-97), Legler's American Book-Lore (1898-99), 19 Literary Collector (1900-05), the Edinburgh Book-Lover's Magazine (1900-09), and Bibliophile (1908-09), and perhaps Philobiblion (1861-63) as well. With so many book-collecting journals neglected, it is not surprising that still lesser and more specialized ones, like Dime Novel Round-Up (1931- ) and Miniature Book Collector (1960- ), are ignored; yet all these periodicals contain material of permanent interest. The two principal journals in this area, aside from the Book Collector , that have started since 1949 are the new American Book Collector (1950- ) and the Private Library (1957- ), both of which are of course covered by the SB lists. But the need for a comprehensive index to the periodical literature of book collecting for at least the period before 1949 is undeniable; such a work would make possible for the first time the systematic use of this large body of bibliographical commentary. 20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Printing and Typographical Journals Although printing and type design as fields of endeavor are distinct from bibliography, bibliographers are frequently concerned with the printing of books and the analysis of type faces; thus any printing or typographical journal—particularly if it contains historical material—may be relevant to the bibliographer's concerns. The number of journals in this area is extremely large (as a glance at Ulrich and Küp will show), ranging from trade journals and house organs to scholarly annuals. Indeed, the field of typography has been fortunate in the number and quality of scholarly periodicals devoted to it. The most distinguished is Simon and Morison's Fleuron (1923-30), but other journals containing important historical research are Gerard Meynell's Imprint (1913), Goudy and McMurtrie's Ars Typographica (1918-34), Simon's Signature (1935-54), Harling's Typography (1936-39) and Alphabet and Image (1946-48), Nash's Printing and Graphic Arts (1953-65), Spencer's Typographica (1958-62), Moran's Black Art (1962-65), and Wrolstad's Journal of Typographic Research [now Visible Language ] (1967- ). At present the only journal devoted exclusively to historical work in this area is James Mosley's Journal of the Printing Historical Society (1965- ). Of all these journals, only a few have received partial coverage in the standard indexes: part (1926-30) of the Fleuron in IBZ , one year (1926) of Ars Typographica in IBBB , and part (1947-48) of Alphabet and Image in the Subject Index constitute the total amount of such indexing in the pre- SB years, though after that time the Subject Index ( British Humanities Index ) did include Signature (for 1949-53), Typographica (for 1949-51), and Black Art (for 1962-65). If these journals are probably the most important in this field for bibliographers, several others contain much useful historical material: graphic arts publications, such as Printing Art (1903-41), PM [later AD ] (1934-42), Print (1940- ), Book Design and Production (1958- ), and, above all, the great Penrose Annual (1895- ); house journals, of which the outstanding example is Monotype Recorder (1901- ); and trade journals of the printing industry, such as Inland Printer (1883- ), American Printer (1885-1958), British Printer (1888- ), and Printing Review (1931-59). The only journals of this group which have received any coverage to speak of are Printing Art , most (1907-39) of which is indexed in the Annual Magazine Subject Index , and Penrose Annual , included in IBBB for 1926-38 and in the Subject Index for 1949-61, although the Inland Printer (in IBBB for 1927-37), American Printer (in IBZ for 1911-20), British Printer (in IBZ for 1911-20 and the Subject Index for 1947-61), and Print (in Annual Magazine Subject Index for 1941-49) have each received brief treatment. Many other printing-trade journals have existed, of course, ranging from the nineteenth-century Typographic Messenger to the twentieth-century Typothetae Bulletin and regional magazines like New England Printer , Pacific Printer and Publisher , Western Printer and Lithographer , and Southern Printer . Although they are principally concerned with current news, the fact that they occasionally contain material of bibliographical interest makes it worthwhile to check the few available guides to this class of material. The Graphic Arts Index , for example, published by the United Typothetae of America in its Service Bulletins from 1932 through 1934 and in the midmonthly numbers of the Typothetae Bulletin from 1935 through 1940, provides coverage, for the period 1927-40, of the large collection of trade journals (English as well as American) received by the Typothetae library. 21 A later similar guide is Printing Abstracts (1946- ), based on the trade journals in the Leatherhead, Surrey, library of PATRA (Printing, Packaging and Allied Trades Research Association)—now called PIRA (Research Association for the Paper and Board, Printing and Packaging Industries.) 22 These guides to trade journals are naturally of limited usefulness to bibliographers, though they do include sections of historical articles; but their existence serves to emphasize the fact that, in a field like printing with an enormous periodical literature, the need is especially urgent for an index drawing together the bibliographical material scattered through these hundreds of journals, both the scholarly and the trade journals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. Book-Trade and Paper-Trade Journals Other industries connected with book production, in addition to printing, have their journals, and the listings in Ulrich and Küp under the headings "Book Trade," "Paper and Papermaking," and "Ink," for example, show how numerous they are. But there are fewer journals in these areas with significant bibliographical contributions, because there are practically no scholarly journals in English exclusively devoted to publishing or papermaking—the journals in these fields tend to be limited to trade publications more than is the case with printing. Nevertheless, their importance should not be underestimated. Publishers' Weekly (1872- ), in particular, during its long run has published a great many historical articles, both on special aspects of publishing and on individual firms, and almost no study of American publishing can be undertaken without recourse to its pages. It is fortunate that—aside from its own semi-annual indexes—it has been covered in IBZ since 1911, with some of these years duplicated in Library Literature (1921- ) and in the Readers' Guide (1929-53, 1961- ). The English counterpart, Publishers' Circular (1837- ), now called British Books , has not been so well treated, for one must consult three indexes in order to cover the journal from 1925 on ( IBZ for 1925-29 and Library Literature from 1933 to the present, with IBBB filling the gap); and Whitaker's Bookseller (1858- ) has only had a tiny fraction of its long run included in IBZ . Of the several nineteenth-century American book-trade periodicals which contain useful information, Sabin's American Bibliopolist (1869-77) is, surprisingly, indexed in Poole; but such other important magazines as the American Stationer (1873-1928) and American Bookseller (1876-92) are not indexed at all. The leading journal of the antiquarian and out-of-print trade is Sol Malkin's Antiquarian Bookman (1948- ), which frequently contains signed articles worth later reference, and it is now (since 1955) indexed in Library Literature . The only publishing journal at present which seems something more than a trade journal is Toronto's Scholarly Publishing (1969- ), and the relevant articles in it will presumably be listed in SB . Of the remaining fields related to the production of books, the paper industry probably has the most publications, but only a few need to be included in a selective list for bibliographers: Lockwood's Paper Trade Journal (1872- ), the Paper-Maker and British Paper Trade Journal (1891- ), and perhaps Direct Advertising (1912- ), as the leading trade periodicals for paper, and Hercules Chemical Company's Paper Maker (1932- ), as the most distinguished house organ, with numerous articles on the history of individual paper mills. Other memorable journals could be named, such as Paper World (1880-98), William Bond Wheelwright's Paper &amp; Printing Digest (1935-39), and particularly Spalding's Quarterly (1923-39), with its historical studies of watermarks. 23 But virtually all material relating to paper is conveniently listed in the excellent series of indexes called Pulp and Paper Manufacture: Bibliography and Patents , covering 1900-55 in five volumes and the years since 1955 in annual volumes; although these volumes are primarily a guide to the technical literature of the field, they do include, under the headings "History" and "Watermarks," much out-of-the-way material of interest to bibliographers. 24 For the field of bookbinding, one could cite Bookbinding Magazine (1925-), 25 and for ink the American Ink Maker (1923- ); and there are the trade journals for less closely related fields, such as Editor and Publisher (1901- ) for newspaper publishing and Printers' Ink (1888- ) for advertising. But the indexing of such periodicals is practically nonexistent in the standard indexes, and a specialized index which would pull the relatively few articles of bibliographical importance out of this mass of material would indeed be a great contribution. All such trade journals, of course, constitute important primary material for bibliographers studying the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and anyone using them in this way would want to work straight through the journals themselves; what a bibliographical index is needed for is to segregate the small number of retrospective—if not scholarly—articles from the large number concerned with current matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. Library Journals The broad field of library publications—including general studies of librarianship as well as accounts of individual libraries—is immense and, since any material dealing with books may potentially be of significance to bibliographers, cannot be ignored. It is true that most of the general journals deal almost exclusively with matters of library administration, but they occasionally have articles of a historical nature and frequently review books of bibliographical interest. Fortunately, the field is well covered by an excellent index, Library Literature (1921- ), and even the period immediately before its inception (1876-1920) is relatively well covered in H. G. T. Cannons's Bibliography of Library Economy (1927), a subject (but not author) index. 26 Library Literature attempts to record all relevant material, wherever it appears, but it does provide a list of basic journals that are regularly and completely indexed. Thus any articles on printing, publishing, and bibliography which appear in any of the general or specialized periodicals in this field can be easily located through this index; and since, in addition, Library Literature surveys some of the important bibliographical and book-trade journals ( Library , PBSA , Publishers' Weekly ), it provides an extremely convenient—and sometimes over-looked—guide to bibliographical articles. 27 Of the general library journals, those of most interest to bibliographers are probably Library Quarterly (1931- ), the leading scholarly journal in the field, Library Association Record (1899- ), especially in its earlier years, and Library Trends (1952- ), along with the more recent Journal of Library History (1966- ) and Library History (1967- ); all these journals have included articles on printers and publishers or on bibliographical trends. Most of the other established periodicals in the field—such as Library Journal (1876- ), Library World (1898- ), American Library Association Bulletin (1907- ), Special Libraries (1910- ), Wilson Library Bulletin (1914- ), Library Review (1927- ), College and Research Libraries (1939- ), and Library Resources and Technical Services (1957- )—are of less interest bibliographically, though one cannot rule them out entirely; and historical articles on printing and publishing do appear in some more specialized publications like Horn Book Magazine (1924- ), dealing with children's books, and Catholic Library World (1929- ), as well as in the Medical Library Association Bulletin (1902- ), Law Library Journal (1908- ), and Music Library Association Notes (1934- ). Many of these journals have been widely indexed—particularly in IBZ , Subject Index , and IBBB —but since all of them are taken up in Library Literature , and for a longer period of time, there is little need to consult the other indexes for this purpose. Publications of individual research libraries present a somewhat different situation. As a general rule, they do not concentrate on library administration but rather on the contents of the libraries involved, and as a result they frequently contain bibliographical examinations of important or newly acquired books in their collections and often in this way supplement or correct previously published bibliographies or provide new demonstrations of bibliographical techniques. Since most major research libraries (and some lesser ones) publish journals, this kind of valuable bibliographical material is widely scattered. Again Library Literature is helpful in covering some of the principal journals, but it does not cover them all. It does take up most of the best-known ones, such as those issued by the New York Public, Bodleian, Yale, Huntington, Princeton, and Harvard libraries (as well as providing partial coverage of those from Boston Public, John Rylands, Rutgers, Library of Congress, Texas, Rochester, and Columbia). But Library Literature must be supplemented by the Subject Index if one is to cover the Aberdeen and British Museum libraries, the National Library of Wales, and additional years of the New York Public and John Rylands. Similarly, IBZ is necessary for later coverage of the Boston Public and Huntington journals; and the International Index must be turned to for some (1917-55) of the important bibliographical contributions of the American Antiquarian Society. 28 But even after supplementing Library Literature in these ways, one still does not have any systematic index to a number of other useful journals, such as those from the Syracuse, Pennsylvania, Duke, Brown, Colby, Newberry, Indiana, Durham, Kansas, Iowa, Hunt Botanical, and Kent State libraries. 29 Many additional periodicals are published by the state libraries of individual states—sometimes as the organs of state or regional library associations and sometimes independently—but these journals contain much less that would normally be of interest to bibliographers 30 and need not be included in a basic list. Many of them—and especially the regional library association publica-cations—are included in Library Literature , and the bibliographer will not be missing much if he does not pursue them beyond that index. Largely as a result of Library Literature , then, the indexing situation with regard to library journals is better than that for any of the other related fields upon which bibliography impinges. A survey of this kind (reinforced by the accompanying table) only emphasizes the fact that, for the years before 1949, the periodical literature of bibliography is not—despite the existence of several excellent indexes—brought together in any single comprehensive index. Because the amount of material is so great, if all the related fields are taken together, it is probably not realistic to expect such an index to be produced retrospectively. And since librarianship has already been well provided for, perhaps the most feasible solution would be to have similarly comprehensive guides—but limited to periodical articles—for the literature of book production and bookselling and for the contents of all book-collecting and bibliographical society publications. Until such works exist, bibliographers will have to resign themselves to time-consuming searches through several indexes. But even the most energetic bibliographer cannot continually turn through all the journals not indexed anywhere. The importance of comprehensive periodical indexes is not merely that they save time in utilizing the accumulated information of the past but that they literally make possible that utilization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Basic Bibliographical Periodicals and Their Indexing In the table which follows, a selective list of periodicals containing material of bibliographical interest is arranged according to the five categories discussed above. For each periodical, indication is made (with the last two digits of the years) of the period (if any) during which it is covered in each of nine indexes. By reading across, therefore, one can get an idea of the best index or indexes to use in connection with a given periodical at a particular time; and by reading down the columns for the indexes, one can see what sort of pool of bibliographical information is available in any particular index. Although the SB lists make such a table less necessary for the years following 1948, the data given here are carried through to the present, since in certain areas—such as the trade journals—one may wish to supplement those lists. This table, it must be emphasized, has a deceptively precise appearance—for the figures in many cases must be regarded only as approximate indications of periods of coverage. There are several reasons for this situation: (1) the figures given here are based solely on the lists of indexed periodicals as printed in the indexes, but these lists are occasionally inaccurate; (2) some indexes, such as IBZ and BHI , do not specify the dates covered in their lists of periodicals, and, if the dates covered do not in fact coincide with the announced dates of coverage for the index volume as a whole, the figures as reported here will turn out to be inaccurate; (3) not all journals listed in an index may be treated with equal thoroughness, for what constitutes completeness of coverage may be susceptible of various definitions (book reviews or brief notes, for example, may be omitted)—thus a duplication in coverage by two or more indexes may not mean that the coverage is actually identical; (4) in the case of Library Literature , only those journals are noted which occur in its list of regularly indexed periodicals, but relevant articles from other journals (which in the present list appear not to be included in Library Literature ) may in fact be recorded there.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 However, various people, recognizing the need, have issued calls for bibliographical indexes from time to time. Randolph G. Adams, for example, said in 1935, "We want a general index to American bibliographical journals which have ceased publication"; he pointed out in regard to such journals as Heartman's American Book Collector that "a mass of valuable information [is] buried in these volumes" ( Colophon , n.s., 1, 293). But no index of the kind he described has ever appeared. A similar concern was shown by M. McIlvaine at the turn of the century; see "The Indexing of Bibliographical Periodicals," Yearbook of the Bibliographical Society of Chicago , 2 (1900-1), 20. 2 Book reviews are not included in the SB lists, but many of them from 1960 on can be located through An Index to Book Reviews in the Humanities (1960- ) and Book Review Index (1965- ). Before that time some can be found in the Modern Humanities Research Association's Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature (1921- ); and the Times Literary Supplement has always paid particular attention to bibliography, reviewing individual numbers of bibliographical journals as well as books. 3 Another annual record of bibliographical material is the Oxford Bibliographical Society's Bibliography in Britain (1963- ), beginning coverage with 1962; it lists only works published in the United Kingdom, but it does include book reviews and the British professional journals in the fields of printing and librarianship. The "Register of Current Publications" in Proof (1971- ) is limited to books. 4 Called at first "Neue Erscheinungen auf dem Gebiete des Bibliothekswesens" and later, in expanded form (beginning with 1904), "Neue Bücher und Aufsätze zum Bibliotheks- und Buchwesen." 5 The Bibliographical Index (1938- ), another prominent current index, is limited to material in checklist form and is therefore less useful as a guide to material in the field of physical bibliography, though naturally some material in this area does turn up there. The earlier Internationaler Jahresbericht der Bibliographie (1931-41), covering 1930-40, though written in essay form, is also concerned largely with enumerative bibliography. 6 These last two works serve in a sense as a cumulated guide to periodicals, since they do bring together a large number of references to bibliographical articles dealing with English and American books. But neither work sets out to provide complete indexing for any periodical; and, in the nature of things, both must have overlooked certain relevant articles in obscure journals which have never been indexed. In any case, the title of each shows that its area of interest is something less than the entire field of bibliography. (A number of other lists of the kind enumerated in this paragraph are recorded in my Guide, pp. 888-93.) At the time of the writing and proofreading of the present article, the first volume of a proposed series called Indexed Periodicals , edited by Joseph V. Marconi and announced for 1972 publication by the Pierian Press of Ann Arbor, was not yet available. Volume 1 is planned to provide a record of all the journals covered by the major American, British, and Canadian indexes and will probably present a more detailed account of the indexing irregularities of those bibliographical journals which it lists than can be found in this article. On the other hand, the present survey tries to cover a central group of journals representing the whole field of English and American bibliography (including some journals not indexed anywhere) and tries to refer to all the principal indexes that take up English-language bibliographical journals (including some indexes not announced for coverage by Marconi). 7 Among other useful individual cumulative indexes are those to the first fifteen volumes (1890-1935) of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society Publications (by M. R. Dobie) and to the seven volumes (1923-30) of the Fleuron (by A. F. Johnson), appearing in each case in the last volume of the group; the excellent index to the first ten volumes (1920-30) of the fourth series of the Library is less used now, since that material is included in Cole's more comprehensive index. One of the most famous and best of all such indexes to single bibliographical journals is Robert Proctor's A Classified Index to the Serapeum (1897). 8 Many of the bibliographical journals listed there, however, have also been covered in more comprehensive indexes (e.g., Bibliographica, Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , Library Quarterly , Library Journal ); nevertheless, a cumulative index to a single periodical is often more thorough than combined indexes to several and may include references to book reviews and editorial commentary, for example. 9 Now conveniently cumulated for its entire run, 1907-49. 10 As early as 1910 J. Christian Bay recommended that the Bibliographical Society of America set up a committee "to look into the problem of unnecessary duplication" in periodical indexes. See "A Survey of Periodical Bibliography," PBSA , 5 (1910), 61-69. 11 A W. Pollard once expressed doubt about the necessity for thorough bibliographical indexes, when he asserted that "it is a question whether the work spent in accumulating bibliographical information which would never be used might not exceed the work at present wasted for lack of bibliographical information that the same ground has already been adequately covered" ( Library , 2nd ser., 6 [1906], 111). It is indeed a question; but one cannot assume that there is any information which will never be used or that there are many discoveries of the past which will be duplicated in every detail. The growth of scholarship demands a knowledge of previous work; and a guide to that work also stands as a historical record of the contours of a particular intellectual movement (in this case, the development of analytical bibliography). The problem presented by bibliographical material published in places where it is difficult to locate (such as in dealers' catalogues or in footnotes to non-bibliographical articles) is discussed further in G. T. Tanselle, "A Proposal for Recording Additions to Bibliographies," PBSA , 62 (1968), 227-36. 12 Other, shorter, lists of bibliographical periodicals exist. One recent list is included in the Widener Library Shelflist Number 7: Bibliography and Bibliography Periodicals (1966), pp. 445-64; another is the list of serials in the Edward C. Kemble Collections on American Printing and Publishing in the California Historical Society, as recorded in the Kemble Occasional , No. 5, Sept. 1968. 13 I have limited the discussion to journals in the English language (or journals like Gutenberg Jahrbuch , with a long tradition of important articles in English). Although many journals dealing with librarianship and with the history of printing are published in other languages, the principal developments in descriptive and analytical bibliography have appeared in English and (aside from the early work on incunabula) have been associated with the study of English and American literature. 14 Because of the presence of the table, the discussions do not always give precise figures and dates; the table can be used to supply the more specific data on which generalizations in the discussion are based. 15 However, the Bibliographical Society's News Sheet (1894-1920), which contains some important material, is not included in any standard index; but an index of it is supplied in G. T. Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Society's News Sheet , 1894-1920," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1967 , pp. 297-307. 16 In this case, consulting the cumulative index to the journal is simpler and more reliable than using the general periodical indexes. 17 It has been included in the Essay and General Literature Index beginning with 1961. 18 It was also provided with an individual index (covering 1882-87) by A. G. S. Josephson in Bulletin of Bibliography , 3 (1902-04), 120-24, 136-39 (reprinted in 1904 as Bulletin of Bibliography Pamphlet No. 12). 19 An index to this journal is included in G. T. Tanselle, "Legler's American Book-Lore ," Gutenberg Jahrbuch 1969 , pp. 331-34. 20 One related category of bibliographical writing which has rarely been indexed adequately consists of the columns on rare books or book collecting which have had long runs in certain book-reviewing publications; the best of these often include material of more than passing interest. Three of the most important American examples began in 1924: "The World of Rare Books" in the Saturday Review of Literature (conducted by Frederick M. Hopkins through October 1927 and then principally by Carl P. Rollins for about ten years); "Books for Bibliophiles" in the New York Herald Tribune Books (conducted by Leonard L. Mackall through April 1937 and then by Lawrence C. Wroth to the end of 1947); and "Notes on Rare Books" in the New York Times Book Review (signed in the thirties and forties by Philip Brooks). Similar columns, conducted by Frederick M. Hopkins and Jacob Blanck, appeared in Publishers ' Weekly in the 1930s and 1940s; and Paul A. Bennett's "Books and Bookmakers" in Linotype News is another example, emphasizing individual designers. Among English columns, Bernard Newdigate's "Book Production Notes" in the London Mercury (1920-37) is well known. 21 It is continued as a section of the Printing Industry of America Management Reports (1947-50), as supplements to the International Graphic Arts Education Association News Bulletin (1951-53), and as a section of Graphic Arts Progress (1954- ). 22 A forerunner, just preceding the Graphic Arts Index, was the Index to the Printing Trade Periodicals of the Year (1930-32), a joint effort of the Printing Industry Research Association and the St. Bride Printing Library. The Industrial Arts Index [now Applied Science and Technology Index ] (1913- ) covers so few printing journals (e.g., Printing Art , Inland Printer ) for such limited periods that it adds little to the coverage available elsewhere. Some articles on printing are entered individually in the card catalogues of collections on printing, like the printed Dictionary Catalogue of the History of Printing from the John M. Wing Foundation in the Newberry Library (1961; supp. 1970); but such catalogues do not normally attempt any systematic sort of periodical indexing (though the catalogue being formed, under George L. Harding's direction, in the Kemble Collections at the California Historical Society does include unusually thorough coverage of articles in journals). 23 Another paper journal, Paper Industry and Paper World , is covered in IBZ from 1949 through 1966. 24 Another related guide is the Abstract Bulletin of the Institute of Paper Chemistry (1930- ). 25 Indexed (under its later title, Bookbinding and Book Production ) in Library Literature for 1936-51; Pacific Bindery Talk is also covered in this index for 1933-39. 26 Cannons supersedes Library Work (cumulated for 1905-11), the forerunner of Library Literature ; but because Library Work includes digests and has author entries, it may still be useful on occasion. Another standard guide to library materials is Robert B. Downs's American Library Resources (1951; supp. 1962), which lists books and articles that make reference to specific library locations of books. The Annual Library Index (originally called Annual Literary Index ; 1892-1910) is actually an index to general periodicals but does cover Library Journal in each volume, as well as the Library in the last three volumes (1908-10). 27 The abstract service for the library field— Library Science Abstracts [now Library and Information Science Abstracts ] (1950- )—is not, as the title suggests, normally concerned with matters of physical bibliography. 28 The Antiquarian Society Proceedings for 1900-10 are included in the Supplement to the ALA Index to General Literature . 29 Annual reports of research libraries also frequently contain bibliographical information. Sometimes they are published, at least in revised form, in the journals (as in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society or the Yale University Library Gazette ); but other important reports, such as Edwin Wolf's for the Library Company of Philadelphia, are issued separately. 30 However, to cite two exceptions, the Missouri Library Association Quarterly has recently given considerable attention to private presses, and the California Librarian has published a checklist (by Theodore F. Gould) on the history of nineteenth-century printing and publishing in California (27 [1966], 97-106).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Bibliographic History of Alfred Tennyson's Idylls Of The King by John Pfordresher</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction In the nineteenth century artists frequently took on projects so immense that they dominated the mature life of their creators. One has only to think of Balzac's Comédie Humaine , Wagner's Ring des Niebelungen , or, the subject of this study, Tennyson's Idylls of the King . Tennyson began thinking about his Arthurian "epic" when he was still a young man—we have notes for several different Arthurian projects sketched in the 1830s—and in 1833 he began with the end, composing his "Morte d'Arthur" which was later integrated into "The Passing of Arthur." "Morte d'Arthur" was published in 1842, but it took until 1885 for the last substantial portion of the poem to appear, the idyll "Balin and Balan." And even then Tennyson was not really finished with his Idylls , because in the last years of his life he continued to tinker at the punctuation of the poem, even instructing, as one of his last creative decisions, that a qualifying line be added to the "Epilogue." Victorians who read the beginnings of this immense work in their childhood were still observing its growth in their old age. Such an extended evolution stirred a curiosity in those early readers which, even in our own time, has not been fully assuaged. They wanted to know, as we still do, how Tennyson carried out such an enormously taxing project. How did he build his poem over such a long period of time? Did he see the plan of the whole clearly, from his youth, or was he forced to cut and add in order to make everything fit together smoothly? In seeking to investigate this problem of growth yet another problem rises up to block our progress. To analyze a poem's evolution one must first learn the full history of that poem. In what order were the several parts written? Do early manuscripts and proof sheets still survive? Those which do can help shed light on Tennyson's creative progress. Then, as new, longer versions of the poem appeared, were earlier versions altered, and if so, to what extent? To put it briefly, the student of the Idylls , in order to answer his critical questions, is forced to answer first a set of bibliographic questions. Tennyson was scarcely dead before the professional studies seeking for answers began to appear. In 1895 Richard Jones published The Growth of The Idylls of the King , 1 based upon a careful collation of eight sets of printer's proof which were even at that early date available for public scrutiny. Subsequent investigation would show that Jones was only exploring the tip of the iceberg, but because his was the only close study to exist, it has remained of great interest until our own day. Next came the bibliographers, attempting to clarify the history of the printed versions of the Idylls . Their progress was snarled by the machinations of the book-seller and forger T. J. Wise. He generously offered his advice to Luther D. Livingston, who was making a bibliography of Tennyson to accompany a sale by Dodd, Meade in 1901, 2 and again to J. C. Thomson who, in 1905, brought out another Tennyson bibliography. 3 In both cases Wise convinced these men that certain "rare trial issues" which were, in fact, Wise forgeries, were legitimate. So, when Wise published his own two volume bibliography in 1908 he had already built an entire bibliographic history for his forgeries, and it was only in the nineteen-thirties that Carter and Pollard, in their An Enquiry Into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets , 4 unmasked the Wise frauds. Still, the Wise bibliography, for all its faults, remains the most complete study to date of Tennyson bibliography, and when used with care can still serve the student. There have been other bibliographic studies of the poem in recent years, the most important being the essay "Some MSS of the Idylls of the King . . ." 5 by the poet's grandson Sir Charles Tennyson. This was the first, and remains the only serious investigation of actual manuscripts. It offers long quotations of variant readings, and probes some of the knottiest questions of chronology. Until now the student of Tennyson, consulting all of these studies, could put together a fairly accurate picture of the poem's history. From Sir Charles Tennyson he would have an insight into the appearance and the contents of a major manuscript collection. From Jones he could determine the extent of variation within a limited set of proof sheets. And from the bibliographers he could construct a fairly accurate chronology of the published editions of the poem. But such a student would be ignorant of the preponderance of the existing manuscripts and proof sheets, and, if confronted with them, would have no ready way of determining their chronological relationship to each other, and to the final poem. But would Tennyson have wanted such problems investigated at all? It is difficult to tell. His oldest son, amanuensis, and biographer, Hallam Tennyson, thought he would not. Hallam, quoting his father, writes, He 'gave the people his best,' and he usually wished that his best should remain without variorum readings, 'the chips of the workshop,' as he called them. The love of bibliomaniacs for the first editions filled him with horror, for the first editions are obviously in many cases the worst editions . . . ( Mem . I, 118). 6 Acting in accord with what he considered to be the wishes of his father Hallam burned "many" papers and put others in collections fenced round with an interdict which prohibited in perpetuity anyone copying or reproducing them in any way. They were to remain mere exhibits, safe from the hands of scholars. But in a contradictory fashion Hallam himself did closely study the manuscripts in the family collection when he set about writing the official biography of his father, and he felt free to quote at length from "Manuscripts never meant for the public eye" ( Ibid. , pp. XV-XVI)—to cite his own words. And in later years the attitude of the Tennyson family has softened on this question. In 1956 Charles Tennyson sold a collection of manuscripts to Harvard imposing no restrictions on their use save that they might not be used to alter accepted readings of the poems. In 1964 the present Lord Tennyson loaned, on an indefinite basis, yet another collection of papers and books to the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln with the same minimal restriction. Finally in 1969 the family was able to lift the "perpetual" interdict on the manuscripts at Oxford and Cambridge, thus opening all the extant Tennyson papers to scholars. Thus the time has come for further serious study of Tennyson bibliography. What follows is as complete a list of manuscripts and printer's proofs as the author has been able to assemble. Those familiar with the poem and the questions it poses will recognize at once that this suddenly expanded Idylls bibliography presents a spate of new problems, problems which the textual history of the poem which follows this list will attempt to solve.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Tennyson's Method of Composition There stands the list, ordered according to the repositories in which the documents now lie. Such an organization in itself indicates the next problem to be faced. How do these various scraps of paper, small blue note-books, tattered proof sheets covered with printer's scrawls, how do they all fit together into the final completed poem which we now know as the Idylls of the King ? The question is one of chronology, and will be answered with a short history of the poem itself, into which each document can be fitted. The authority for the chronology is purely textual. Every manuscript, proof sheet and edition has been collated with the final version and compared with its fellows, following the theory that as an individual text diverges from the final version more and more, it can be considered to come earlier and earlier in the history of the poem. But before we begin we must consider how Tennyson set about writing poetry. Once we know something about his methods of composition, we will be able to readily understand the relationships among these scattered and confused sources. Tennyson was a man who did much of his work in his head—he was not addicted to scratch pads and doodling. He would begin a new work with a period of brooding which, for his longer works, could last for months. In his later years he described this habit to a friend. "I can always write," he said, 'when I see my subject, though sometimes I spend three quarters of a year without putting pen to paper." 7 Such a practice rules out the possibility that we will discover in the manuscripts a large number of false-starts and half-formed conceptions. Only when he had roughed out the entire pattern of the poem, when he could "see" it, would Tennyson begin the work of versification. This too began mentally, either during certain hours which he formally set aside for composition, or during his long rambles about the downs of the Isle of Wight. He would begin, his son tells us, with a "single phrase" which he would "roll about" in his head, over and over, elaborating it into poetry ( Mem. , I, 268). As he worked he muttered the lines aloud, testing their sound and feel; his was always a "verbal" poetry ( Ibid. , p. 378). At this stage the poem was in a remarkably fluid state. As a friend of his tells us, "he might say aloud and almost as it were to himself, some passage he had just made, but seldom twice in the same words, and unless written down at once, the first and original form of it was lost or 'improved'" (Knowles, p. 168). It is at this point in his creative process that Tennyson would begin jotting down his lines. The overall plan was established and he was creating poetry to fit that plan. As it came to him he would write it down, even if, as was often the case, he had only two or three lines ready. It seems evident from the confusion of his notebooks that he did not work through his poems from the first line to the last, creating them in sequence. Rather, he would work on whatever passage or scene seemed "ready" for composition. The end result of this method is the jumbled state of the earliest drafts which have survived. These are usually scattered across the pages without order or pattern and frequently appear in a scrawl which clearly mirrors its writer's hurry. As he continued to work Tennyson would commence molding these random scraps together into a continuous narrative, altering phrases, lines, sometimes entire blocks of lines. Though the overall patterns persist, minor characters and incidental scenes appear and dissolve as the final poem begins to emerge. Sir Lamorack falls into shadow; elsewhere, Sir Bors appears. The final text is, in fact, the product of relentless and persistent craft. Though Tennyson may have labored hours shaping a line, he is merciless with his creations, and again and again he will chip and patch, write and rewrite, cut or expand. For some poems we have draft after draft, each filled with new revisions, some of which seem to us as perhaps inordinately picayune, but which to Tennyson were, in fact, of equal importance to the cancellation of an entire passage. When Tennyson began working on his second set of four Idylls he turned to a new compositional procedure. The process of slowly molding scraps of poetry in his head was evidently enormously taxing, and consequently he began to write out prose drafts of his poems before the actual versification. Most of the manuscripts, both prose and verse, which have survived, are on a variety of pale blue paper of which Tennyson was fond. He purchased this paper unbound and worked on it in quires, often ripping out pages if he was dissatisfied. As the work progressed from fragmentary scraps to continuous narrative, he would begin writing on only the right hand page, reserving the left for the inevitable alterations and additions. In this manner he was sometimes able (e.g. in the Trinity "Enid" [CT-30]) to assemble pages from various drafts into a fair copy. When the poem was finished his wife would frequently sew the pages into small "notebooks" and hand cover them with marbled boards and orange-red spines. Following the final manuscript draft would come the spate of proof sheets, over which Tennyson worked with great care. While he was writing out his poetry in manuscript Tennyson never concerned himself with punctuation. Many times he would write on for lines without a single punctuation mark, frequently even neglecting to capitalize the first word of a sentence. He was a wealthy and successful poet by the time he actually began the Idylls , and his publishers were evidently happy to cater to what must have been his expensive preference. The slightly punctuated manuscripts would be sent to the typesetter whose proof sheets became the ground on which Tennyson worked out his punctuation. Because he was such a perfectionist this could often be an extended process in itself. The most extreme example is "Merlin and Vivien" which went through five different versions of proof before it was finally set up and sent to the printer. Years later, when preparing "Gareth and Lynette," Tennyson reduced the number of proof states he needed, but heavily corrected two different copies of the same proof state, evidently trying to get the punctuation "right" on the first try. Even then he required two more proof states before the actual first edition was set up. This scrupulosity, this endless nagging concern for his poems drove Tennyson to tinker at them even after they were finally placed under the public gaze. In virtually every new edition of his Idylls Tennyson would make alterations, generally in punctuation, but sometimes in word choice as well. For this reason, no copy of the poem printed during his life matches the final version, published only after his death. His epic was in fact in a state of endless alteration, until finally death itself came to halt the tinkering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Bibliographic History of the Idylls of the King Evidently from the days of his youth Tennyson had resolved on creating a "major poem," and from an equally early period he settled upon the Arthurian legends as a subject which had not yet been exhausted. Hallam Tennyson reprints in his biography three different sketches for an Arthur poem, all dating from the 1830s. One is a short prose draft, one a set of jottings which create an allegorical framework (presumedly for a large work), one an outline for a five-act play. And there were, evidently, further attempts, now lost. In 1859, when Tennyson was finally polishing his first four Idylls for the press, he wrote his friend the Duke of Argyll that, "Many years ago I did write 'Lancelot's Quest of the Grail' in as good verse as I ever wrote, no, I did not write, I made it in my head, and it has now altogether slipt out of memory ( Mem. , I, 457). The significance of these sketches and early, mentally composed poems is that the Arthurian legends represented for Tennyson, from the early days of his creative life, the monumental project which, in the future, it was his destiny to complete. There were moments when he was discouraged, diverted. But, from our vantage point, looking back on his career, it is difficult to see how he could have avoided writing the Idylls . It was, from the beginning, the focus of his life's work. The poem, as we now have it, germinated during the intense emotional crisis which struck Tennyson on hearing of the death of his friend, Arthur Hallam, in 1833. Their friendship was deep and intense, and Tennyson felt a serious personal loss. But further, as the long sequence of lyrics In Memoriam: A. H. H. demonstrates, in Hallam's death Tennyson discovered the reality of death itself. The poems begun in this period are filled not only with laments for the departed Hallam, but with morose brooding over man's mortality. And it is in the midst of these sorrows and fears that the first draft of "Morte d'Arthur" appears, written out in a notebook between In Memoriam lyrics and sketches for "The Two Voices," once titled "Thoughts of a Suicide" ( Mem. , I, 109). This first draft appears in a Trinity College manuscript (Ct—17) and is clearly headlined First Draft. The manuscript also contains a second draft of the poem, this time with the lines numbered. Sir Charles Tennyson is sure these drafts were done during the year 1833. 8 Tennyson was evidently finished with the poem by 1834, when "he told Tennant he was busily copying out his 'Morte d'Arthur' . . ." ( Mem. , I, 138). The poem was not published until the now-famous two-volume edition of Tennyson poems published in 1842. But this does not mean that it rested on the shelf during the interval between its drafting and its first publication. Tennyson was habitually reading his poems to his friends; and Edward Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Khayyám, tells of hearing Tennyson read the "Morte" in 1835 ( Mem. , I, 153). In addition, Tennyson permitted close friends to copy from his manuscript. Several copies still exist. One is from The Heath Commonplace Book (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), a manuscript collection of poems by a friend of Tennyson. At the Houghton Library, Harvard, there are two more copies of the poem, one probably in the hand of James Spedding (MH-H-21). Whereas the poem was popular with his friends, Tennyson was not at all sure of its public reception. He intended it to be a test of public reaction to his long meditated Arthurian epic. Tennyson hoped a short poem would be readily accessible. "I thought that a small vessel, built on fine lines, is likely to float further down the stream of Time than a big raft." 9 Regardless of the merit of the poem itself, Tennyson's fears were probably justified. "In 1842," as Kathleen Tillotson has written, "Arthurian story was still strange to the ordinary reader, and even felt to be unacceptable as a subject for poetry." 10 To prepare the public, Tennyson cushioned his Arthurian tale with a framing poem called "The Epic" which describes a drowsy Christmas Eve party at which the poet Everard Hall is persuaded to read his Arthurian poem, one of "some twelve books" (1.22) which he had burnt, dissatisfied "that nothing new was said, or else/Something so said 'twas nothing . . ." (11.30-31). The experiment, even with the cushion, was a failure. The collection as a whole drew praise, but the "Morte d'Arthur" was criticized, particularly by John Sterling who felt that "The miraculous legend of 'Excalibur' does not come very near to us, and as reproduced by any modern writer must be a mere ingenious exercise of fancy." 11 Though he often affected indifference, Tennyson was deeply hurt by critical remarks, and in this case he himself confessed that Sterling's strictures "finally decided him to postpone this project, making him feel his powers were not adequate to the task." 12 With this melancholy, though perhaps accurate self-assessment, Tennyson let his Arthurian project lapse for fifteen years. It was twenty-seven years until the "Morte d'Arthur" would be integrated into a new and growing epic whole. But while Tennyson busied himself with other projects, it is clear that the Idylls were never far from his mind. In 1843, the year after Sterling's review, he was already fashioning the first lines of "Merlin and Vivien" (ll. 228-231) while on a trip to Ireland ( Mem. , I, 218). In subsequent years he made other trips, with his purpose even more evident. In 1848 he visited Bude, Tintagel (Mark's Castle), and Land's End at the tip of Cornwall, legendary land of Lancelot ( Ibid. , pp. 274-275). Sir Charles Tennyson tells us that on his return home he began work on a Merlin poem, but was interrupted. 13 In August of 1853 Tennyson traveled to Glastonbury ( Mem. , I, 376-377), the ruined abbey which legend says Joseph of Arimathea founded when he reached England. Readers of the Idylls will recognize at once that these are all places which the poem mentions and describes. Though he may not have admitted it at the time, Tennyson was doing research. When Tennyson began again, he began in earnest, though the exact date of his new start is subject to debate. Sir Charles Tennyson says that a rough draft for this new Arthurian poem, now called "Merlin and Vivien," was finished by January of 1856. 14 Hallam Tennyson tells us the poem was begun February 1856 and complete (at least in its first form) by March 31st ( Mem. , I, 414; Mat. , II, 161). There still exist a remarkable number of manuscripts and proof states for this poem. We have no less than five different manuscripts representing the early stages of composition, probably written out in the early months of 1856. Two of these manuscripts are single sheets of paper. (MH-H-152) covers lines 237-261, and (CtY-III). actually a torn shred of paper, includes lines 916-918, with fragmentary jotting from "Enid" on the reverse. Then there are three small notebooks which contain more extensive sketches and drafts—(MH-H-30) and (MH-H-31) are both bound, and both have been severely mutilated. (MH-H-30) covers lines 315-353, c. 691ff., and 805-826. (MH-H-31), which also includes drafts for "Guinevere," covers lines 811-843. (MH-H-153a), 16 pages of paper sewn together, contains extensive drafts, in somewhat scrambled order, covering lines 267-458, 553-630, 666-683, 838-862. All of these manuscripts represent Tennyson's first steps in composition. All of them, save (CtY-III), remained in the family collection until the 1950s. There are also two fair drafts of the whole poem still extant. The first, presented to Frederick Locker and auctioned in 1924, 15 is now in the Huntington Library (CSmH-HM-1326). This draft precedes the second fair copy, now in the Harvard Library as Lowell 1827.12. 16 Tennyson gave this manuscript to Mrs. Julia Cameron, the pioneer photographer and his neighbor on the Isle of Wight. She sent to him asking for the manuscript for "Guinevere," the Victorian favorite from the first volume of the Idylls . Evidently Emily Tennyson was slightly piqued at this, and Alfred sent Mrs. Cameron the draft for "Merlin and Vivien" ( Mat. , II, 220). It, like the Huntington, is complete, and it is evidently one of the last copies made before the first printed proof. "Merlin and Vivien" was not, in its early stages, known by that title. In fact, the wily seductress of Arthur's wizard is called, on all the manuscript drafts and in the early proof states, Nimuë. And that name was the first title given the poem. There are five different states of printer's proof for "Nimuë"—"Vivien," the first four employing the name "Nimuë." The first of these is in the British Museum "trial book" Enid and Nimuë: The True and the False , designated here as (L-1). The second is one of two proof states bound in the Forster Library volume, The True and the False . It can be distinguished from the later Forster proof by the name of the villainess, and by its length, 97 pages. The third proof state is represented by three different copies, two in the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln, designated (LiT-M1), one in the Yale Library (CtY-VIII), which is fragmentary. The fourth state, in two copies, can also be found at the Tennyson Centre, and is here called (LiT-M2). In the fifth state the name is finally altered to "Vivien." The sole known copy of this state is the second proof for "Merlin and Vivien" in the Forster collection. It is 101 pages in length. Finally, there is the actual first edition state, which appeared in 1859. A quick glance will show the vital role these successive proof stages played in the development of the poem's punctuation, as well as in the final polishing of certain phrases and lines. Tennyson was not finished with "Merlin and Vivien" after the 1859 publication. He was to return to it again in the years 1872-1874, to alter a number of passages, and add 140 new lines. I will describe the manuscripts relating to these changes in my account of the 1873 and 1874 editions. Having finished a draft of "Merlin and Vivien" Tennyson turned at once to another tale, which he called, initially, "Enid," but which modern readers know as two distinct idylls, "The Marriage of Geraint," and "Geraint and Enid." In 1870 the poem was retitled "Geraint and Enid," and in 1873 Tennyson split it in half, numbering the parts I and II. Only in 1886 was the first half called "The Marriage of Geraint." For convenience, I will presently deal with it as Tennyson first did, as a single entity, titled "Enid." Emily Tennyson's diary mentions from time to time the progress her husband was making on this, his second idyll. He began it on 16 April, 1856 ( Mat. , I, 161). On June 1st he was working on the song "Come in" ( Ibid. , p. 164). June 16th he wrote his wife that Enid was "a little harder to manage than Merlin" ( Ibid. , p. 165). By July 27 he had finished the scene describing Geraint asking for Enid's hand ( Ibid. , p. 167) and on August 1st the tournament was done ( Ibid. , p. 168). By October 17 he was far enough along to read aloud from "Enid" to his friends, but on November 11 he was still "working at Enid" ( Ibid. , p. 173). Only on May 6, 1857, could he finally write his wife from London telling her that the final proof sheets had been sent to press ( Ibid. , p. 180). In the existing manuscripts one can see the struggle which consumed Tennyson over these months. "Enid" is a long poem even by Victorian standards. And it was all composed, bit by bit, in the poet's head, and the scraps jotted down as they came. The notebook, (MH-H-32) is filled, from cover to cover, with such jottings, scattered in random order, written right side up, up side down, sideways. (MH-H-71a) is just slightly more organized. 17 These two manuscripts show us Tennyson laboring over every line. And he faces even more prodigious difficulties when it comes time to join these scraps, along with the "Enid" drafts from (MH-Lo-1) and from manuscripts now lost, into a single, continuous whole. We can see these difficulties in the Trinity manuscript (CT-30). By this point Tennyson is pulling things together, but the struggle involved is manifest in the remarkable number of alterations and revisions which crowd the pages of the Trinity copy. In an effort to see the poem clearly, Tennyson had his wife make a fair draft from the Trinity manuscript, and then recommenced his alterations on this copy, now in the University of Texas Library (TxU-S-E). And his labors extend even into the poem's numerous proof states. The first state exists in two copies, one in the Forster True and False volume (LVA-F-EN1), the other at the Tennyson Centre. (LiT-EN-1). The student can readily spot them by the bizarre printer's error in line 74 of "The Marriage of Geraint," "the column of his knotted throat." The second "Enid" proof state is in the British Museum trial book Enid and Nimuë (L-1). The third and fourth states are both in the Tennyson Research Centre, and are here called (LiT-EN2), (LiT-EN3). The final proof state, again in the Forster volume, is called (LVA-F-EN2). Once Tennyson had finished the first manuscript drafts for both "Nimuë" and "Enid," he had them set up in type and bound together into a "trial book," a job his printer had finished by May 6, 1857 ( Mat. , II, 180). As we have already said, this book contains the first "Nimuë" state and the second "Enid" state. Tennyson titled it Enid and Nimuë: The True and the False . Evidently he was seriously considering publishing only these first two poems. And as Hallam Tennyson tells us, "Several friends urged the immediate publication of the newly-written Idylls, among them Jowett, who says . . . 'Anyone who cares about you is deeply annoyed that you are deterred by critics from writing or publishing . . .'" ( Mem. , I, 425-426). But Tennyson decided against publishing the pair. F. T. Palgrave tells the story. These two Idylls it was A. T.'s original intention to publish by themselves. Six copies were struck off, but owing to a remark upon Nimuë which reached him, he at once recalled the copies out: . . . From this change of purpose &amp; delay given (sic) the idea of publishing the four as 'Idylls of the King': a felicitous accident for English literature! 18 So Tennyson withdrew his "trial book." But he did not turn from his Arthurian epic. Instead, he recommenced writing idylls. The third, in fact, was already begun by July 9, 1857, when he presented his wife with lines 575-577 of what was to be the poem "Guinevere" ( Mem. , I, 419). By January 8, 1858 he had written the parting of Arthur and Guinevere ( Mat. , II, 193). February 1st, Guinevere's final speech, March 5th the song "Too Late," and on March 15th, a finished fair copy ( Ibid. , p. 195). This was faster work than "Enid" had been, and in later life Tennyson confidently told a friend he had written the poem in "a fortnight" ( Mem. , II, 202). The most fascinating "Guinevere" manuscript is (MH-H-31), an early set of sketches for lines 238-253. They tell of the early, magical days of the reign of Arthur, and depict a kingdom of marvels, filled with fairies. These early drafts are narrated in the first person. In later drafts Tennyson put the tale into the mouth of the little novice, thus altering it into a fable recounted of the distant past. (MH-H-36) is, however, the most important of the "Guinevere" manuscripts. As Sir Charles Tennyson describes it, "A characteristic of this fragmentary rough draft is the number of rough notes, often mere indicators of the rhythm and wording of the final text, which are jotted down, here and there, apparently just to fix an idea which had come into the poet's mind." 19 As the manuscript goes on there appear longer continuous passages. The whole covers lines 127-209, 398-682. (CtY-IV) contains a manuscript copy of the song "Too Late," and (MH-H-73a), a single sheet, includes lines 365-394. The Trinity manuscript (CT-39) is a fair draft of the whole poem and leads directly to the first proof state. This can be found in a small volume in the British Museum catalogued as C.133.a.7 (Here, L-2). A second state is in the Forster True and False volume. Guinevere was finished and copied in March, 1858. By mid-June Emily writes, "He told me his plan for 'The Maid of Astolat.'" ( Mat. , II,200). We hear little else about the new poem until February 4, 1859, when Tennyson was "finished writing down all but a little of 'The Maid of Astolat'" ( Ibid. , p. 213). This poem which we now know as "Lancelot and Elaine" retained "The Maid of Astolat" title through two proof states, then becoming "Elaine." Only in 1870 was the title finally altered to the present "Lancelot and Elaine." Remarkably little seems to have survived from the creation of this long poem. The Houghton Library has a single sheet (MH-H-114a) covering lines 1346-1352. There exists only one other early manuscript, but that a very important one. Once in the library of Templeton Crocker, it is now in the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia. Consisting of thirty leaves, this manuscript contains about 725 lines, written, as in the early drafts of the three preceding idylls, in scraps and short blocks of verse. In the Trinity College manuscript (CT-39) these blocks come together. This, while a continuous draft, can hardly be called final. There are many variants, and sometimes, as in the case of Lancelot's final soliloquy, the poet is still roughing out the shape and length of the poem itself. Three proof states survive. The first two are both titled "The Maid of Astolat," though in the second state this is crossed out and replaced (in manuscript) with the new title "Elaine." The first state is found in the small (L-2) book which also contains a proof of "Guinevere." There are portions of another copy of this state at the Tennyson Research Centre. The Centre also possesses the sole copy of the second state, called here (LiT-L2). There is, finally, a third proof state in the Forster volume. It is time now to talk at greater length about that peculiar book which contains the last proof states of all four idylls as well as the first state of "Enid" and the second of "Nimuë." All are bound together and headed with a title page which was later rejected. Evidently Forster obtained both a complete version of a very late "trial book," created just before the first edition, and some earlier proofs as well, and had them all bound together. This would then be, in part, a second "trial book," and it is considered such by most bibliographers. It bears the title The/ True and the False./ Four Idylls of the King . The University of Virginia possesses another copy of this title page, altered by Tennyson into the final form which was used for the first printing. Why did he change The True and the False to the Idylls of the King ? Wise suggests that the 1859 publication of a novel by Lena Eden, False and True , forced the alteration. 20 Whatever the reason, the title page was reset, and yet another set of plates prepared, but this time for an actual publication. In March 1859 Tennyson went to London to work on the final proofs, and in May the last proofs of "Elaine" were complete ( Mem. , I, 437). Forty thousand copies were ordered for the first printing and, in the first week of sales, 10,000 copies were sold ( Ibid. , p. 444). The volume was in the end both financially and poetically very successful. But with success came the burden of pressure. The first four idylls were not at all a closed entity. Their episodic nature left them open to addition. Further, by this date the initial criticisms of "Morte d'Arthur" were part of a distant past, and any ardent Tennyson reader would have wished that poem to be integrated somehow into a larger whole. On 24 September 1859, the Duke of Argyll wrote Tennyson, "Macaulay . . . was in great hopes that you would pursue the subject of King Arthur, and particularly mentioned the Legend of the 'Sangreal' as also the latter days and death of Lancelot" ( Mat. , II, 236). But Tennyson was not ready and replied on October 3 that "As to Macaulay's suggestion of the Sangreal, I doubt whether such a subject could be handled in these days, without incurring a charge of irreverence. . . . The old writers believed in the Sangreal" ( Mem. , I, 457). So, for the moment, the Idylls gave way to other concerns. On 14 December 1861 Albert, the Prince Consort, died. Tennyson began, almost immediately, 21 to compose a poem dedicating his Idylls to Albert, who once had personally indicated pleasure in the Laureate's Arthurian epic ( Mem. , I, 455). By January 9, 1862, Tennyson's publishers had the poem set in type. 22 Special copies were printed up and circulated free to those who already possessed a copy of the Idylls . Tennyson sent some copies to the Princess Alice; she replied on January 19, that the Queen felt the poem's lines "had soothed her aching, bleeding heart." ( Mem. , I, 479-480) There are three manuscript copies of this dedication still extant. (MH-H-96a) is clearly a first draft, with (MH-H-95a) coming as a second draft, embodying the corrections of the first. There is also a peculiar copy made in another hand (CtY-V), which was evidently transcribed from (MH-H-96a) before it was corrected. The Yale Library also has the only known printer's proof for the Dedication (CtY-VI) with manuscript corrections in Tennyson's hand. The British Museum has a copy of the free leaflet, under the press mark C.59.i.2. In 1862 a fourth edition of the Idylls appeared, with a few minor corrections. This edition included, for the first time, the Dedication. In the meantime, the Holy Grail project continued to trouble Tennyson. In January, 1862, Emily Tennyson writes that "A. T. talks of writing an Idyll on the Quest of the Sangreal but fears handling the subject lest it become irreverent" ( Mat. , II, 342). The external pressures to expand the Idylls continued as well. On February 23 of the same year Argyll wrote that the Princess Royal "is very anxious that you should make the Morte d'Arthur an ending of the Idylls—adding only something to connect it to Guinevere." 23 It seems evident that Tennyson wanted to go on, but could not find the way. The dam finally broke in March of 1868. Emily writes, "A. T now worked regularly . . . writing 'The Holy Grail'" ( Mat. , II, 79). In April yew trees rich with pollen inspired both lines 13-16 of "The Holy Grail" and lyric XXXIV of In Memoriam ( Mem. , II., 53). By the 9th and 11th of September Tennyson was reading bits of the new poem aloud ( Mat. , III, 88). September 14 Emily writes that Alfred is ". . . almost finished with the 'San Gral' in about a week (he had the subject clearly for some time). It came like a breath of inspiration" ( Ibid. , p. 90). This at first sounds self-contradictory, since there are so many references to earlier composition. Evidently Tennyson must have been considering the poem as a whole for some time and creating only scraps until the momentous week in September when it all came like an "inspiration." The Houghton notebook (MH-H-38) bears this out. It consists of a rough draft of the entire poem in prose, the first instance of Tennyson's following this practice in the creation of a particular idyll. The prose draft occasionally slips into sections of verse, and those could be the bits and pieces he had created incidentally before setting down the prose version. Following the prose comes a verse draft, written out with relative confidence. This is probably the work book for that week of inspiration. Huntington (CSmH-HM-1323) contains a few further drafts for "The Holy Grail," drafts of passages which were still being developed after (MH-H-38). On October 22 Emily tells us that Tennyson "finished copying out his 'Holy Grail' for the press." ( Ibid. ) She is probably referring to what is now Trinity notebook (CT-29), which contains a complete draft of the poem in a form very close to the first proof state. In November the poem was sent to the printer ( Mem. , II, 59). This brings us to a peculiar problem. Tennyson went on, immediately after composing "The Holy Grail," to write three further idylls. All four were set up in proof at the same time and appear, grouped together, in four different proof states. It is easy to arrange these in order. But, in addition, there are two proofs for "The Holy Grail" alone. In both of these proofs the page numbers are printed between parentheses at the center of the page top. The problem is to determine the order of succession. We begin with the four states of proof for the entire volume, The Holy Grail, Etc . The first of these is in the Ashley Library at the British Museum (L-A-2104). The volume, originally owned by Fredrick Locker-Lampson, was purchased at his death by T. J. Wise. It bears no title page. Of the four idylls therein, three have titles differing from the final version. "The Coming of Arthur" is called "The Birth of Arthur," "Pelleas and Ettarre" is "Sir Pelleas," and "The Passing of Arthur" is "The Death of Arthur." There are manuscript corrections. The second state of proof is in the John Sterling Library at the University of London (LU-S-925). This volume contains the four Grail idylls plus copies of the 1859 idylls, all bound together to form a trial version. The last two proof states are both represented in the collection of the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln. There is one copy of (LiT-HG1) with the last idyll ending on page 156; the Berg Collection also has a copy of this state (NN-B-VIII), with manuscript corrections. Lincoln holds two copies of (LiT-HG2), with the last idyll ending on page 158. Both of the last two states employ the now-standard titles for the poems. This sequence of four states is readily established. The difficulty arises when one tries to explain where the two special "Holy Grail" proofs belong. The following is my conjecture. Tennyson first had the four poems set up in the volume (L-A-2104). He made a few corrections in this version (only eight in the case of "The Holy Grail"), and a second copy was pulled, (LU-S-925). Meanwhile, for the sake of ease, Tennyson had his printers make up some sheets from the Ashley version for further correction and emendation. The corrections from both (L-A-2104) and this new set of proofs (NN-B-VI) were embodied in a second "Holy Grail" proof (MH-H-HGP). Meanwhile, following the Ashley/Sterling tradition only, another version of all four idylls was set up (LiT-HG1) and (NN-B-VIII). Then Tennyson combined the corrections from the (LiT-HG1) (NN-B-VIII) state and the (MH-H-HGP) state into yet another proof state, (LiT-HG2). This became the source of the first edition. This explanation is complex, and not terribly satisfying. But it seems at least possible, giving the existing confusion of the data. We have dealt with the proof states for all the idylls included in The Holy Grail, Etc . But we must return now to a brief description of the creation of the three poems which accompanied the title idyll. These poems—"The Coming of Arthur," "Pelleas and Ettarre," and "The Passing of Arthur"—were all written within a remarkably short period of time. The earliest drafts have all been mutilated mercilessly, and probably for commercial motives. It was the custom in the late nineteenth century for a book dealer to increase the value of an item by binding with it manuscript fragments which had an "associational value." A rich collector would be more tempted to purchase a first edition of the Idylls if some manuscript scraps were bound in with the book. Evidently the first drafts for "The Coming of Arthur," "Pelleas and Ettarre," and "The Passing of Arthur" were in the possession of Frederick Locker-Lampson, whose Rowfant Library was auctioned in 1904-1905. Thomas J. Wise bought much of this collection, and a few years later he sold John Henry Wrenn a copy of The Holy Grail, Etc. volume with numerous scraps of manuscript bound in. 24 Wise himself retained the proof copy (L-A-2104) we have already discussed and had more scraps bound therein. It seems reasonable to assume that Wise possessed sketches of these three poems, cut up the manuscripts, and evenly distributed the fragments between his copy and Wrenn's. We find further support for this conjecture in the fact that Wise possessed a fair draft of lines 20-71 of the "Coming" while he sold Wrenn the rest of the manuscript, covering lines 74-423. 25 It is difficult to guess how much was lost as Wise plied his lucrative scissors. Certainly, we will never know in what manner these drafts were placed within the notebooks, nor how many draft passages have been destroyed. Once finished with the story of "The Holy Grail" Tennyson turned to the problem of rendering the very earliest days of Arthur's reign. By February 13, 1869 he was reading portions of "the birth and marriage of Arthur" to his wife ( Mem. , II, 63). Before the end of February he had read her "all" of the poem, though on May 7 he had just finished "'Leodogran's dream,'" ( Ibid. , p. 65) the vision which finally persuades Guinevere's father to give her to Arthur in marriage. Probably he had finished the bulk of the poem in February but continued to add to it in later months. We possess early drafts of the poem in the Ashley and Texas (Wrenn) scraps. Next, there is an early full draft of the poem which exists part in the Ashley collection (L-A-4521), part in the Wrenn collection at Texas (TxU-S-C). Finally, there is a late draft in the Berg collection (NN-B-1). This came to New York via the A. H. Japp collection and the library of Jerome Kern. 26 These manuscripts give an account of the writing of the poem as it appeared in 1869. But Tennyson was not yet finished. In the 1873 Library Edition he added lines 66, 94-133, 459-469, 475-502. I will discuss these additions in relation to that volume. On May 19th of 1869 Tennyson was already reading portions of a new poem, "Sir Pelleas," to his wife ( Mat. , III, 107). This tale had been on his mind for some time. On 28 June 1859 he had read Malory's "Sir Pelleas and Ettarre" to Mrs. Cameron and Emily Tennyson "with a view to a new poem" ( Ibid. , II, 220). Now, in the spring of 1869, he carried out his plan. As with "The Coming of Arthur," there are rough drafts, some prose, extant in the Ashley and Texas scraps. Texas also has a continuous draft of the poem (TxU-S-P). Lines 387-403 were added in the 1873 edition. There seems to be no reliable means for dating the composition of "The Passing of Arthur," though it is safe to say that the work was done in the spring of 1869. Of course, much of the idyll was finished decades earlier, as the "Morte d'Arthur." Tennyson now surrounded this poem with new material, fitting it into the overall pattern of his epic. Some early sketches for this framing material still exist. (MH-H-37), (MH-H-39), and a scrap of paper included in the proof state (NN-B-VIII) all contain drafts for Sir Bedivere's speech c. line 51. (MH-H-37) also has further sketches. The Ashley and Texas scraps offer some drafts, and a sheet bound into a copy of The Holy Grail, Etc. in the Widener collection holds a draft of lines 144-154. These are all preparatory manuscripts. There is no known fair copy. As it was published in 1869, "The Passing of Arthur" lacked lines 6-28, added in the 1873 edition. On November 1, 1869, Emily Tennyson reports that "we were very busy about the new volume of poems, 'The Holy Grail'" ( Mem. , II, 83). It was around this time, then, that the four trial books already described were set up and amended. On November 25, Emily continues, "A. T. went with Mr. Locker to look after his proofs in London . . ." ( Mat. , III, 134). Forty thousand copies of the book were printed up at once, and, as Hallam tells us, "in consequence of the large sale, my father made more in this year than in any other, the profit realizing over 10,000 pounds" ( Ibid. , p. 138). The title page of this volume, The Holy Grail, Etc. , is dated 1870, but the book was actually published in December to take advantage of the Christmas trade. Consequently, it is referred to in the present list as ('69). At the same time, Tennyson's publishers released an edition of the Idylls of the King which included not only The Holy Grail, Etc. poems, but the first four idylls as well. This text is subsequent to The Holy Grail, Etc. embodying certain corrections not in The Holy Grail, Etc. (In this list the 1869 Idylls of the King is designated '69 ). Both these volumes refer, for the first time, to the tales framed by "The Coming" and "The Passing" as "The Round Table." In 1870 Strahan issued an edition of Tennyson's complete works in small volumes, called the Miniature Edition. It contains all the idylls written to that date and is significant in that there are a number of changes in the titles of the poems. "Enid" becomes "Geraint and Enid," "Vivien," "Merlin and Vivien," and "Elaine," "Lancelot and Elaine." There are few textual alterations. Tennyson was now past the hurdle posed by the San Graal tale, and he evidently regarded the Holy Grail volume as only a step towards his final end. In November of 1870 Emily records the fact that he has already written parts of a new poem, "The Last Tournament" ( Mem. , II, 100). This project, like the Pelleas tale, had been in his mind for some time. As far back as May 24, 1859 he had read that portion of Malory "where Sir Lancelot behaves so courteously to Sir Palamedes, and where Arthur goes to see La Belle Isoude (with a view to a poem on Tristram and Isolt)" ( Mat. , II, 218). On July 17, 1866 he composed lines 12-15 of this idyll ( Mem. , II, 39), though the real work did not begin until November of 1870. May 21, 1871, Emily writes, "He read me his 'Tristram' the plan of which he had been for some weeks discussing with me" ( Ibid. , p. 104), and by the end of May the poem was sent to the printer. 27 It is difficult to tell which printer this is, because "The Last Tournament" first appeared in The Contemporary Review for December, 1871. There are at least three proof states for this publication, all represented in the Texas collection. But there were also two proof states set up before the first book edition. October 23, 1871 Emily again talks of proof, saying, "We arranged 'The Last Tournament' for the press" ( Mat. , III, 177). It seems probable Tennyson at first had the book proofs set up, and only later decided to let the poem first appear in the periodical. In (MH-H-40) there is a brief prose draft for the opening of "The Last Tournament." No other prose exists for this poem. Huntington Library manuscript (CSmH-HM-1323) has a draft of the lines describing the tournament day (lines 151-187) and the Berg collection has a complete draft (NN-B-III) from the collection of Sir James Knowles, auctioned in 1928. 28 Tennyson had given the manuscript to Mrs. Knowles, whose husband edited the Contemporary Review ( Mat. , III, 179). Two proof states precede the first edition. The first state is represented by two copies, (L-A-2101) in the Ashley Library of the British Museum, and a Berg Collection copy (NN-B-III), acquired from the library of Sir James Knowles in 1928. There is a copy of the second state in the University of Texas Library, from the collection of Frederick Locker-Lampson. 29 As he readied "The Last Tournament" for the printers Tennyson was already at work on yet another idyll, again a project he had long considered. On February 18, 1861 he had read the tale of Sir Gareth in Malory, doubtless considering it for his epic ( Mem. , I, 471). Emily tells us that on October 19, 1869 Tennyson "gave me his beginning of 'Beaumains' (Sir Gareth) to read, written (as was said jokingly) to 'describe a pattern of youth for his boys'" ( Mat. , III, 133). Evidently the poet set this project aside in favor of "The Last Tournament." Only when that poem is in print do we again hear of Gareth. November 20, 1871—"A. T. read the beginning of his new poem of 'Sir Gareth' which he had just written down" ( Ibid. , p. 178). It is a long poem, and Tennyson worked at it for some time. 30 But by July 9th of 1872 he records the manuscript sent to the printers, though he feared that the manuscript was so "ill written" that it would confuse his typesetters ( Mem. , II, 113). He worked over the proofs during September and by the 24th was able to return them to the printers ( Ibid. , p. 116), his task finished. There are a remarkable number of "Gareth" manuscripts in existence. Tennyson began his work for the poem with prose drafts. There is a long draft for the opening to the tale, (MH-H-40), part of which was later rejected. The Texas collection includes two pieces of paper with prose sketches, and the Butcher's Book, (MH-H-32), has a sequence of prose passages. This manuscript represents the bridge between prose and verse for the poem, and is one of the most fascinating of the Tennyson manuscripts. Unlike the orderly translation of "The Holy Grail" from prose to verse, "Gareth" was evidently done in a confusion of bits and pieces, leaving bursts of prose and poetry scattered in random order over the many pages of this manuscript. It seems that Tennyson simply grabbed the book at odd times as he worked, only later troubling to bring everything together. The Widener Collection possesses an unusual volume which may directly relate to (MH-H-32). This book, clearly created for a wealthy collector, contains "Gareth" proof sheets for the 1873 Library Edition and numerous drafts for the poem in manuscript. These drafts have been cut from some earlier source and pasted onto pages by the binders. At least one student of Tennyson manuscripts thinks that these Widener scraps come from (MH-H-32). 31 The first continuous draft of the poem can be found in (NN-B-IV) (lines 1-125), while the Bodleian Library copy contains a complete text, on pages the same size as the Butcher's Book. This, in all probability, is the "ill written" manuscript Tennyson sent to his publishers. There are three proof states for "Gareth." The first, in which the heroine's name is spelled "Lineth," exists in two copies, (L-A-2109) in the British Museum, and (LU-S-929) in the University of London Library. Both contain numerous authorial corrections. There are also two copies of the second state, one in the Berg Collection (NN-B-II), one at the University of Texas. The Texas collection holds as well a unique copy of the third proof state (TxU-S-GP3), this embodying many of the corrections made on the Texas copy of the second state. (TxU-S-GP3) in turn holds even further authorial manuscript corrections, these appearing printed in the first edition. In December 1872 "The Last Tournament" and "Gareth and Lynette" were published together as Gareth and Lynette, Etc . That edition contained an explanatory paragraph which, in its proof state, indicated that these two poems concluded the Idylls . This was corrected before the book was published, but it indicates the possibility that Tennyson may not have been completely sure of the final shape of the poem, even at this late date. Proofs for this paragraph are now in the Berg Collection and in (TxU-S-GP3). But Gareth and Lynette, Etc. was not to be the end, for Tennyson had long since begun work on still further additions to his poem. As "The Last Tournament" went to press Tennyson was already "busy about Strahan's Library Edition . . ." (October 23, 1871). 32 This was to be, like the Miniature Edition of 1870, a multi-volume collection of Tennyson's work to date. Tennyson seized on the event to further develop his Idylls . This would be the first edition to contain all of the poem he had finished (including the Gareth poems), and so he decided that it would also be a good moment to take a second look at the poem as a whole. Consequently, he began work in 1871 and continued emending the text into 1873. There are hundreds of minor alterations, but Tennyson also took this moment to expand four earlier poems, and write an "Epilogue." To "Merlin and Vivien" he added lines 187-192. (MH-H-39) has the manuscript draft for these lines. It also contains a draft for some of the additions to "The Coming of Arthur" (lines 59-115). This poem received the most additions, including lines 94-133, 459-469, 475-502. The Pierpont Morgan Library contains a draft for lines 459-467 bound in a copy of The Holy Grail, Etc. (MH-H-29a), a single sheet of paper not in Tennyson's hand, contains a copy of lines 94-134. And the Berg Collection possesses a draft of "The Song of the Battleaxe" (lines 475-502), probably written out November 6, 1872 ( Mem. , II, 117). At the same time ( Mat. , III, 198) Tennyson decided to add a song to "Pelleas and Ettarre" (lines 387-403), and there survive two manuscripts, both in the Huntington Museum (CSmH-HM-1324, CSmH-HM-19494), the second in another hand, with manuscript corrections by Tennyson. Finally, he added lines 6-28 to "The Passing of Arthur." To conclude the Idylls volumes of the Library Edition, Tennyson decided to write an "Epilogue" addressed to Queen Victoria. This was already finished and "copied out" by Emily Tennyson on December 25, 1872 ( Mem. , II, 119). Extensive drafts for the "Epilogue" can be found in (MH-H-32), the Butcher's Book which contains so many "Gareth and Lynette" sketches. Tennyson's publishers set up an early printing of the poem in eight pages for presentation and had fifty copies printed. The Ashley Library has one, (L-A-2111). Tennyson sent his "Epilogue" to the Queen and she acknowledged the poem on February 26, 1873 (Wise, I, 224). The Library Edition volumes V and VI, which contain the Idylls , were published in 1873. In 1874 two more editions of Tennyson's collected works appeared— the Cabinet Edition in ten volumes and the Author's Edition in six. (Wise, II, 33-37). Both contained a new text for "Merlin and Vivien," which included, for the first time, lines 6-146. Several manuscripts for this addition have survived. (MH-H-33) has sketches, some of which were afterwards abandoned. This manuscript also contains passages from "Balin and Balan" and illustrates Sir Charles Tennyson's contention that the "Vivien" alterations and "Balin", published so much later, were in fact products of the same creative period. 33 (MH-H-37), in the midst of further "Balin" sketches, has one page with a draft for lines 128-144 of "Merlin and Vivien." There are also two fairly complete drafts of the addition, both headed "The Beginning of Vivien" in the author's hand. The earlier, (MH-H-34), has many alterations, while the Yale Library (CtY-1) copy, purchased in 1949 from the library of Col. Prinsep, is quite fair and clearly is close to the first printing. Further editions appeared through the next ten years, but gave no indication that Tennyson was at work on any further Idylls . Doubtless most readers considered the set complete. Then, in November of 1885 (Wise, I, 271), Tennyson published a collection of his later work called Tiresias, and Other Poems which included "Balin and Balan" subtitled in that edition, "An introduction to 'Merlin and Vivien.'" All the evidence seems to indicate that, in fact, this idyll was composed early in the 1870s, probably after "Gareth and Lynette" and was contemporaneous to the additions being made for "Merlin and Vivien." 34 There are a number of quite early manuscripts relating to this idyll. (MH-H-37) contains fragments of prose sketches as well as verse. (MH-H-33) has very early drafts for passages around lines 246 and 455. (MH-H-32) has a large number of drafts, chiefly in the form of discrete blocks of poetry, covering lines 9-81, 150-192, 306-329, 386-391. (MH-H-47) contains only two pages of drafts for lines 430-457. The next creative stage is represented by the Huntington Library's (CSmH-HM-1323), a full draft of the poem, but with many alterations. (CT-31) is clearly a manuscript copy made up for the printer. It is a ruled notebook with manuscript on various pieces of paper glued in. Evidently the poet cut up a number of his fair drafts and glued them into this notebook for his typesetters. There is one puzzle surrounding "Balin and Balan." Sir James Knowles, a close friend of the poet, gave Tennyson's son Hallam what he called a "prose sketch" for "Balin and Balan." Hallam printed it in both his Memoir of his father and in the annotated Eversley Edition of Tennyson's works. Since Knowles has said that Tennyson dictated the draft to him, we do not expect to find it in the Tennyson manuscripts. But, what we do find are short prose drafts other than the Knowles copy, and many verse fragments which appear to precede any prose draft. Sir Charles Tennyson concludes that these jottings "seem . . . to represent Tennyson's first thoughts . . . and to have been written before the composition of the prose sketch dictated to Knowles." 35 This sketch then becomes little more than a curiosity which played no organic part in the composition of the poem. On these grounds I have omitted it from this list. "Balin and Balan" was readily integrated with the rest of the Idylls of the King in the 1886 New Miniature Edition. Tennyson's life was now essentially complete. He worked on his last poems, helped his son and biographer prepare an annotated edition of his works, and reminisced. But in 1891 he instructed his son to insert one more line into the Epilogue to the Idylls (1. 38), describing Arthur as "Ideal manhood closed in real man." This was first published in the Edition Deluxe of 1899. In 1908 the Eversley Edition, with Tennyson's notes, was published, and the long period of the growth of the Idylls finally came to an end.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Method for Compiling a Concordance for a Middle English Text by Sidney Berger</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alan Markman's pioneering essay on the creation of "A Computer Concordance to a Middle English Text" 1 was one of the earliest attempts to explain how to make such a concordance. However, he concentrated primarily on the problems he and Barnett Kottler faced in the production of their concordance to the works of the Pearl Poet, rather than on a general method of compiling a concordance to a Middle English text. I am now nearly finished compiling a concordance to LaƷamon's Brut , done with an ingenious programmer, George Rompot, and the University of Iowa's IBM 360-65 computer. The results are promising, I think, and some of the methods deserve to be set forth as a practical and practicable means of making a concordance. I have formed some of my ideas with this in mind: that the person compiling a concordance should keep in mind the many uses to which his labors will be put. If this means "extra" work in categorizing and cross-referencing words, separating homographs, or gathering variant forms of one word, this extra work is not only worth-while but necessary to make a useful concordance. The first step in preparing a concordance is selecting a copy text. Most Middle English texts worth making a concordance for exist in more than one edition, and if there is no "standard" edition of the work, one should select a single text and stick to it, noting in footnotes or a separate table the variants in the other major editions, if they are worth noting. The quality of the edition and its ancillary material should help to determine which one will be used. I emphasize this because it is necessary for the person making the concordance to adopt a "neutral" stance toward his material, and he can do this most easily if he does not have to worry about editorial matters in the text — matters which the editor of the text should be relied upon to decide. By "neutral" I mean that he should rely on his edition for decisions such as the reading of a carelessly-spelled word in the manuscript or the meaning of a word on which other editors disagree. For example, if an editor whose edition is being used glosses a word which is spelled "gode" as "good," the concordancer 2 should list this word under this meaning, despite another editor's decision to interpret this word as "god." Warnings that this is the concordancer's policy must appear in the concordance; for if one tries to adopt one reading from one editor, one from another, and yet a third from his own reading of the text, he is no longer a mere concordance-compiler, but an editor, and his concordance will be of little use to anyone trying to find a word. To be useful, a concordance must enable its user to locate quickly the word he wants to find; if the text used for the concordance is edition A, but the concordance lists words under interpretations given in edition B or C, the user will not be able to find the word he seeks. 3 Markman says that the next major problem faced by the concordancer is to put the text into what he calls a "machine readable" format "so that the computer system can digest it and perform operations with it" (p. 55). By now many people in the humanities have worked enough with computers to consider this a fairly trivial problem; but one important thing must be kept in mind before this phase of the computer project is begun: what will the final output look like, and therefore, what sort of information is it necessary to feed into the computer to arrive at this design? For example, before I actually began the work on my concordance, Professor Stephen Parrish of Cornell University Press suggested that to make my final output more readable and attractive than some of the earlier computer-assisted concordances, I should try to design the final output to be printed in upper and lower case letters, rather than the usual upper case computer printing. So when I put the text onto IBM cards, I coded in a special character which preceded all upper case letters. Eventually the special symbol was deleted, the letter following it was printed in upper case, and the line was back-spaced to fill up the space formerly taken by the special character. Concordancers who will be separating their texts into grammatical categories for, say, nouns, verbs, and adjectives, may want to indicate in the initial input of data which words fall into which categories. If a separation of homographs and a gathering of variant forms can be made while or before the material is fed into the computer, perhaps during the feeding in of the text some codes can be inserted to separate these forms automatically later. 4 The frequently-used modern term for this activity is "pre-editing," much of which is necessary to help one anticipate what sort of things he must tell the computer when his text is being put onto cards, tape, or disc. It was my experience that working with IBM cards was the easiest and least expensive way of handling the material. I found it more convenient to have the cards in order to proofread and make corrections in my own study rather than at a computer terminal. Therefore, I put the entire text into card form, had the cards listed (i.e. printed out by the computer exactly as they had been punched on the cards), and did my proofreading of the text from these lists. If time and finances permit, the proofreading should be done with someone reading the lists aloud, while another person checks this oral reading against the edition used for the basis of the cards. Because of the great variations in spelling which most Middle English texts present, it is advisable to proofread by spelling out most words rather than by trying to pronounce them. It may slow the work considerably, but it will result in a vastly more accurate text, and is thus worth the effort. While the text is being proofread, some of the corrections can be made and inserted into the deck of cards. It is of course practical to overlap these two tasks if time allows. And again, by dealing directly with the cards, the concordancer remains closer to his text than if he were working with the much more costly computer terminal. Ultimately using cards is more accurate. As I said earlier, I used a method of "pre-editing" which I found to be most helpful and efficient. While the text is being punched, the key-punch operator is required to do little thinking, and also has little room on the machine for extra papers. But during the proofreading stage, the mind can "think" or "interpret," when much of the sorting of lexical items which will eventually need to be done can be accomplished. The proofreading goes slowly enough to allow the concordancer and his assistant (assuming his assistant knows something about the language being read) to think; therefore during the reading homographs can be separated, variant spellings gathered, 5 typographical errors and key-punch errors located, and so on. These simple tasks also help to break the monotony of the proofreading. For example, I made charts separating 'good' from 'god,' 'idon' ('did') from 'idon' ('excellent, noble'), 'ræd' ('advice, counsel, situation') from 'ræd' ('to advise, tell') and from 'ræd' ('ready' or the past tense of 'ride' or 'read'), and so on. It is important to anticipate all homographs in the text, so that later there will be little trouble separating them. 6 Also during this proofreading phase, the concordancer can list for his own benefit any irregularities he might encounter which deserve to be glossed in special places in the concordance, which ought to be given special cross-references, or which deserve mention in an introduction. 7 Following the editorial convention of his day, Madden had the printers set his edition of the Brut with all the abbreviations and peculiarities of the manuscript, so I was able to locate all instances of such things as dotted y 's [y], unusual abbreviations, interchanging of u 's, v 's, f 's and w 's for one another, etc., during the proofreading. My charts were eventually helpful in the commentary, and in the compiling of the final concordance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First Program Concurrently with the proofreading I ran the deck through a special program designed by my programmer, Mr. George Rompot. This clever program checked the data for "illegal" characters, other "illegal" combinations of key-strikes, and sequence. It was easy to tell the computer what keys were "legal" in our punching, and to direct the machine to locate all those key-strikes which were of non-allowable characters. Though this program cannot find other spelling errors, it is a back-up for the oral proofreading. Further, we could tell the computer which combinations of key-strikes were not legal (e.g. consecutive blank spaces, blank spaces on either side of a hyphen, blank spaces at the beginning of a line, consecutive q 's, capital letters within a word [except in hyphenated compounds], and so on), and the machine would list for us all occurrences of these. Finally, since most texts will have some consecutive numbering of words, lines, or pages, and since this 'consecutive numbering' information will most likely be fed into the computer along with the initial input of raw data, it is a simple thing to have the machine check for correct 'sequence' (i.e. whether the line numbering is correct). Since the deck I worked with had lines numbered consecutively from 1 to over 32,240, it was easy to locate errors in line numbering in the deck of cards. I think I can safely say that there will be no errors in this area in the final concordance. And the time saved by not having to proofread all those numbers was great.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Second Program Once the proofreading is completed and the corrected cards inserted into the deck, an alphabetical word-list may then be generated. Whereas the first program gave in output only a list of errors which it found, this program could give an alphabetical list of every combination of key-strikes in the work (the machine does not think in terms of 'words'; it recognizes combinations of key-strikes bounded by blank spaces), along with a frequency count of each item. The frequency-list is what Larry D. Benson calls "the normal by-product of a machine-produced concordance," 8 and is so easy to produce that one should appear in every computer-assisted concordance. A quick proofreading of this list may turn up errors not caught in the oral proofreading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Third Program The next step one should take is to run the material — now from a computer tape since the material must be on a tape to generate the frequency-list — through the machine to generate the preliminary concordance. This program should give an output of a complete alphabetized list of words in the work with only the line numbers in which the words appear. It may be possible to get a line concordance at this stage (for shorter texts — say under 5,000 lines of verse), but that is not needed. It is from such a list that the concordancer works to separate further homographs which he no doubt will find during the proofreading, to help him refer to the text to verify peculiar spellings, to help in the gathering of variant spellings which will eventually be listed under a single headword, and so on. I found several errors which slipped by me in the other proofreading phases of the project when I had this preliminary concordance. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fourth Program Since the material is now on tape, and since one may very well find errors in the text, there is a simple but necessary program that will allow the concordancer to make up cards with corrections of the errors, and to insert these cards, automatically substituting the corrected readings for the incorrect ones. The output for this program will be a list of the original readings, and the corrected ones which have been substituted. The lines with errors can easily be located since each line has a unique number in the data. At this point one is at a crossroads: the data, including headwords and cross-references, could all be put onto computer tapes and the computer could be directed from a terminal how to group and categorize the words, and which to separate from which; or, human hands could manipulate a deck into the final concordance, which could then be printed out from the cards. The former plan would require hundreds of hours at an IBM terminal, feeding information into the computer. The costs of this method are very high (between $2.50 and $3.00 per hour plus the salary of the person sitting at the terminal). Furthermore, it would still be necessary for the person sitting at the terminal to type out all headwords and cross-references, a task which would complicate matters greatly and increase the amount of time considerably. The method I used, however, was inexpensive, and was, I believe, more accurate than the 'terminal method' would have been. Using the preliminary concordance and the glossary in the text I was dealing with, I punched all headwords and cross-references on IBM cards. In this form they can easily be listed and proofread, and corrections can be made with simple substitutions of cards. One must anticipate what sort of information will be needed for these cards, and how many key-strikes he may allow himself. For example, I designed the page to be six inches in width, so the headword and cross-reference cards could not exceed sixty (or perhaps 62) key-strikes. As Benson complains (p. 273), the Beowulf concordance does not always separate homographs, and the cross-referencing is somewhat inadequate. I suggest that every form of every word (or at least every potentially unrecognizable form) be cross-referenced. It may take a good deal of trouble (as I so painfully found out), but the ultimate benefit derived is worth-while. Users of the concordance will find it a more versatile and valuable tool if this is done. And I think Markman and Kottler have set an excellent precedent in their method of handling headwords (a method I have slightly modified): 1) All Middle English words which have close Modern English equivalents in spelling and meaning should be glossed under the Modern English form (perhaps with a few of the basic and unusual Middle English spellings given in parentheses, and certainly with most of the various forms the word takes cross-referenced, directing the reader to the proper headword). Thus, the headword might be as follows: ABOUT (ABEOT, ABUTE(N), ABOUTEN, IBUTEN, YBOUTEN) Then, at the various spellings there should be entries as follows: IBUTEN (see ABOUT) 2) All Middle English words with Modern English equivalents in spelling only, should be glossed under their main or most common Middle English form with definitions given in parentheses, as follows: LAUERD (LORD, MASTER, HUSBAND) Listing all forms of this word under 'LORD' is misleading, for the word could also mean "master" or "husband"; the addition of a few basic meanings of the word is extremely helpful for the user of the concordance. 3) All Middle English words with no Modern English equivalents should be glossed under their main or most common Middle English form with definitions in parentheses, as follows: HENDE (FAIR, COURTEOUS, SKILLED, GOOD) 10 The cross-reference and headword cards will be simple to punch in one large deck, using the preliminary concordance and the glossary of the text as guidelines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fifth Program Although it is little trouble to alphabetize these headword and cross-reference cards by hand, it is simpler to let the machine do it. The computer should be used for every mechanical process it is capable of performing. And the computer can errorlessly alphabetize and punch out a new deck of headword and cross-reference cards, which could then be inserted manually into another deck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sixth Program The next to last program needed by the concordancer is one which has the computer punch out a deck of concordance cards, on which are 1) the word being glossed, 2) the complete line of text which will be concorded (either a single line of verse or the specific context 'surrounding' the word for a KWIC concordance), and 3) the line number or other designation which will identify the location of this line. The first item of these three will eventually be deleted from the final print-out of the concordance, but will be most helpful in the sorting of the cards. This deck of cards — large though it may be (I had nearly fifty boxes of cards) — is much less costly to work with than a computer terminal, and keeps the concordancer closer to his text, because he can see each line individually while organizing the cards, and can easily insert the headword and cross-reference cards and rearrange others to their proper places in the deck. That is, one can carefully consider any form of a word which might not belong in the alphabetical sequence in which it automatically fell. Making the separations and gatherings of forms by hand during this phase of the project is no more difficult than doing it at a terminal. One thing must be added here. The program which I used to produce the concordance cards was modified by Mr. Rompot in such a way that I could delete from the deck before it got punched any word or words which were to be deleted from the final concordance. 11 Thus, before submitting the program to punch out concordance cards for all the words beginning with the letter a , I inserted into the program a small, alphabetized deck of cards with the words 'a,' 'an,' 'and,' and so on, which were never punched by the computer. The few occurrences of, say, 'æ' which were words that I wanted to include in the concordance (e.g. where it meant 'river' or 'ever') I was able to locate and punch myself. And it would not be necessary to search through the scores (or hundreds) of occurrences of such words if one makes note of such individual occurrences during the proofreading stage. It is just such a thing which must be anticipated before beginning the proofreading. During this hand-sorting stage it is advisable to have an extra box for IBM cards nearby in which to place cards the computer had fed out in alphabetical order, but which belong in the deck under a headword which falls later in the alphabet. For example, one will have many past participles beginning with the letter i which should be glossed under their root words; ITAKEN should be given under TAKE, and at ITAKEN there should perhaps be a cross-reference to TAKE. Until one gets to the sorting of the t 's, he should store the ITAKEN's apart. This is the method I used, and I found it to be most effective.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Seventh Program Once the two decks (of cross-reference and headword cards and of concordance cards) are integrated into one, with the cards all in the desired order, one has the entire concordance in deck form. It is simple, then, to run the deck through the computer to get the final print-out. But it may also be necessary to remove from the IBM cards certain symbols which had been substituted for other characters. 12 This can be done by means of a fairly simple program. For example, as I mentioned above, I coded into the deck during the key-punching of the text a symbol which preceded capital letters. The special program deleted the symbol, back-spaced the line into the space formerly used by the symbol, and printed the entire line in lower case letters except those letters formerly preceded by that symbol. Any symbol will do, of course, just so long as it is not one of the letters used in the text. (I used an equals sign.) This special program also deletes from the concordance cards the word being glossed, which is no longer needed since both the headword and the line of the text will 'speak for themselves' concerning what word is under consideration at this point in the glossary. Further, since it is easiest to type the headword and cross-reference cards in all upper case letters (on the key-punch machine that is all one has), rather than insert a 'capitalization symbol' before each letter to be capitalized in the final print-out, this last program can be instructed to recognize all headword and cross-reference cards (because of the fact that they have no line numbers or text indications on them), and can be instructed to print them all in upper case. Hence, all my headword and cross-reference cards were printed in upper case, and all my text cards in lower case except those characters preceded by an equals sign. There is only one small exception to this: on the cross-reference cards I did not want the word 'see' to be in capital letters, so the program included a statement to the effect that on all cross-reference cards the word 'see' should be printed in lower case. (I did this, too, for the word 'or' on the headword cards. See the sample pages below.) This last program is also the one which must be 'taught' how the page is to be printed. With special IBM charts, I mapped out what I considered to be an aesthetic and legible format, and Mr. Rompot programmed the material to match my design. 13 I suggest (following Mr. Benson's critique) that concordancers keep in mind that their efforts are likely to be used by eye-weary scholars, and thus the page should not scare away potential users of the concordance. If room allows, the text lines should be 'legibly' apart from one another, they should be indented from the headword and cross-reference lines, and the text citations should be close enough to the text lines to be easily linked with the correct line (without the unsightly row of dots separating them). If one is going to take the trouble to make a concordance — and no small trouble it is! — he should at least make his volume legible and attractive. The specific problems each concordancer faces concerning homographs, homonyms, variant spellings, compounds, hyphens and prefixes (especially negative prefixes for Middle English verbs), words to be deleted, alphabetization, abbreviations of all sorts (depending, of course, on the type of text being used, a published edition or a manuscript), apparent typographical or scribal errors in the 'copy text' chosen, proper nouns, punctuation, and so on — all these and other specific problems directly related to each text must be dealt with by each concordancer. One could not possibly state any general rules to follow for so varied a set of problems. All one can expect is that the policies adopted will be logical and consistently adhered to, that they will be stated clearly at the beginning of the concordance so that the user of the volume will know how to proceed, and that they will produce an easy to use, legible tool. My suggestions about how to arrange and use headwords and cross-references seem to me logical, and were practicable for the text with which I was working, but may not be so for every text. The usefulness of the final volume must be the guiding principle in every phase of the compilation of data, regardless of how much extra work the compiler subjects himself to. What good is a giant volume of data so hard to use and so confusing in its arrangement of material that it hardly pays to struggle with it? The following are sample sheets from the Brut concordance. This preliminary copy was printed on the University of Iowa's computer which does not have the proper characters on its print chain; I have therefore substituted the following: for þ the number 3 for ð the number 6 for Ʒ the number 9 for æ the symbol &gt; The final print-out will of course contain the Middle English letters, in both upper and lower case. As I stated above, I have 1) listed Middle English words with close Modern English equivalents in spelling and meaning under the Modern English spelling [e.g. FOSTERED]; 2) listed Middle English words with Modern English equivalents in spelling only under their Middle English forms with a few definitions [e.g. FULLE]; and 3) listed Middle English words with no Modern English equivalents in their most common form with definitions [e.g. FULLUHT]. I have further cross-referenced some of the variant forms which can be found under headwords elsewhere in the concordance [e.g. FOT(E) (N), FULLEHT].</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Alan Markman, "A Computer Concordance to a Middle English Text," Studies in Bibliography , 17 (1964), 55-75. 2 I use this word for brevity; Professor John McLaughlin, of the Linguistics Department at the University of Iowa, suggested the term to me. 3 In my work on the Brut I used the only complete edition of the poem ever published, that of Sir Frederick Madden (Society of Antiquaries, 1847); Professor G. L. Brook, who is preparing a new edition for the Early English Text Society, has concurred with my selection of texts. Though I disagreed with Madden's interpretations of some words, I glossed them under the meanings he gave for them. Thus the word 'bihedde' Madden glosses as 'viewed' for line number 30155; it seems to me that he is in error here, for the word seems to mean 'greeted.' But in my concordance the word may be found under the meaning he gives. 4 Later I will suggest a different method for separating homographs and gathering variant forms which worked very well for me. Professor Richard L. Venezky of the University of Wisconsin has other suggestions on a similar level in Computers and Old English Concordances (1970), which is a record of what was said at a conference of the same name held in Toronto in 1969. 5 The problems of homographs and variant spellings have been recognized for many years; see for example Stephen Parrish's article "Problems in the Making of Computer Concordances," Studies in Bibliography , 15 (1962), 8-9. Unfortunately, Mr. Parrish's article, like Mr. Markman's, deals too much with the problems they encountered on their respective projects, and not enough on general principles and methods of compiling a concordance. 6 A few other Middle English homographs to watch for are: soon/son/sun, here (here) /here (army), Brutus/Bruttes (which could mean Brutus or Britons), aðel(e) (n) (noble) /aðel(e)(n) (chief, elder), nomen (names) /nomen (take), are (form of the verb 'to be') /are (mercy), for (the conjunction)/for (went), sunnen (sons)/sunnen (sins), in (in or within)/in (inn or hostelry), græten (to greet) /græten (great), and so on. A careful perusal of the glossary of the edition will help the concordancer to locate the ones he needs. 7 For example, I separated the word 'worse' (the comparative form of 'bad') from the word "Worse' (a substantive extension of that comparative form, but which has come to mean 'the devil'). 8 Speculum , 45, No. 2 (April 1970), 274. 9 Mr. Rompot has assured me that even though it is possible to combine this program with the previous one, it is easier and safer not to do so. Many computer programs take several 'modifications' before they work the way they were designed to, and it is much less costly and much safer to separate the complex functions of alphabetization and counting from the function of compiling the line-number concordance. 10 In 1960 when Mr. Parrish delivered the paper mentioned in note 5 above, he outlined three possible ways of handling the format of the headwords, cross-references, and text of the concordance (p. 10); he apparently did not think of the method I have chosen, which seems quite practical and eminently 'usable' from the reader's point of view. 11 Professor Venezky has called these "stop-words . . . usually high-frequency function words" ( Computers and Old English Concordances , p. 67). Professor John McGalliard, of the Department of English at the University of Iowa, has suggested to me that since it has generally been the policy of concordancers to tend more toward completeness than toward abridgment in their listing, and since with the computer's aid it is no trouble at all to print every word of a text, it seems to me that only the most 'dispensable' words be deleted from the final concordance. What took scholars of the pre-computer era years to compile takes us literally minutes. There is no reason, therefore, for omitting words like 'after,' 'but,' 'can,' and so on; these words have their interest to linguists, statistical-stylists, and others. But of course there is no reason for including words like 'a,' 'an,' 'and,' 'be,' 'the,' or hundreds of personal or relative pronouns. Words of such abundance (I encountered over 7400 'and's' in the Brut ), if they are to be studied, can be amassed in great quantities without the need of a concordance. But even a complete record of these is readily available so long as the computer tapes which were used to generate the original concordance are still available. 12 The key-punch machine does not have an ash, a thorn, an eth, or a yogh, so I substituted symbols for these. Eventually they will be converted to the proper characters when they are run through a computer with a print chain with the proper characters. Philip Smith, at the University of Waterloo, has informed me that his computer now has such a chain, and he will allow me to use it for some reciprocal labor of key-punching. Hence, the sample pages included here will have a 3, 6, 9, and &gt; substituted for the thorn, eth, yogh, and ash respectively. 13 I included in my design page numbering. It should be be remembered, in case the concordance is to be published, that one should number the even numbered pages on the left, and the odd numbered pages on the right, as in most printed books, or all pages in the center bottom.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Lower-Case "2-r" in 16th Century English Black Letter Texts by Melvin H. Wolf</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Readers of 16th century English books are generally aware that the black letter fonts of the period included two forms of lower-case "r" — the one which is still commonly used in roman type, and the form called "round-r" or, because of its similarity to the Arabic numeral "2", "2-r". It is generally known, too, that both forms derived from Medieval manuscript forms of the letter. What does not seem to be generally known is that a standard printing practice determined which form would be used each time the letter appeared, and that this standard practice was so consistently followed by English printers that deviations from it identify either typographic errors or idiosyncratic policies of particular compositors. (Such idiosyncrasies might well prove helpful for the identification of anonymous printers and compositors.) Apparently, much the same convention had been followed by some medieval scribes, but the scribal convention seems to have been followed less generally and less consistently than the printing convention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A plain description of the convention followed by virtually all English printers from 1510 onward seems at first glance to be based on neither rhyme nor reason, but I believe that a principle was indeed at work, and that the principle was an aesthetic one. To begin with the description: In 16th century English black-letter texts, the "2-r" form is used only and always when immediately preceded by: 1) lower case b, d, h, o, p, w, and y, 2) upper case B, D, O, P, and G, 3) upper case W in those fonts in which the rightmost limb of that letter is rounded convexly. It follows that the "2-r" form is not used as the initial letter of a word, since the immediately preceding piece of type would then be a space.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As case (3), above, suggests, the principle which seems to have been followed is simply this: letters ending in convex curves are followed by the "2-r" form; all other letters (and spaces as well) are followed by the other form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This principle, if applied consistently, would seem to have demanded that upper-case H, M, and Y, in most black letter fonts, be followed by "2-r". Those letters are not listed in case (2) above, because I have encountered no instances in which those letters were followed by a lower-case "r" in either form, but when such instances are encountered, I predict the principle will hold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholars of three kinds may find the following mnemonic phrases helpful when examining 16th century English black letter texts; each phrase includes all the lower-case letters which one may expect will be followed by "2-r".</field>

      <field name="heading_text">On the Use of the Verb 'Facere' in Early Colophons by Dennis E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In April 1970 the British Museum bought a copy of the Exempla of Marcus Antonius Coccius (Sabellicus), completed at Venice on 19 September 1507. It is a quarto of 150 leaves, collating [* 4 ] A-Z, AA-MM 4 NN 6 , and it bears foliation up to fol. CXLVI. The most interesting feature of this book is the colophon which reads: 'MARCI ANTONII SABELLICI DECEM EXEMPLO = | RVM LIBRI FINIVNT. IOANNES BARTHOLOMEVS | FECIT. VENETIIS. M.D.VII. SEPTEMBRIS. MEN = | SIS: DIE. XIX. LAVREDANI PRINCIPIS ANNO | SEXTO.' There is no recorded printer at Venice in 1507 (or at any other time, as far as I am aware) named Joannes Bartholomaeus. The book is printed in type 82 R., and from the woodcut initials used in it one can safely attribute the printing to the press of Georgius de Rusconibus, whose main activity as a printer at Venice falls within the period 1500-1521. The same N which appears on leaf Y4 verso of the Coccius appears, with the same breaks, on leaf A1 recto of La vita de Merlino et de le sue prophetie historiade of 20 April 1507. 1 The same I on leaf FF2 verso of the Coccius appears on leaf P2 verso of the Merlino , with the same large break in the top left-hand frame-line. The capital P, showing three boys, one of whom is wearing a mask, is found in the Coccius on CC1 recto, and also on h4 verso of the Ovid, Metamorphoses , which Georgius de Rusconibus printed on 2 May 1509 2 ; while it is repeated on h4 recto of the same printer's Ovid of 20 April 1517. 3 Finally, the same capital N of the Coccius, noted above, is found on q3 verso of the Ovid of 2 May 1509. There seems to be no doubt that the Coccius came from the press of Georgius de Rusconibus on 19 September 1507. What then is meant by 'Ioannes Bartholomeus fecit'? I have found two other examples of early sixteenth-century books which were printed by well-known printers, yet bear in their colophons, accompanied by the verb 'fecit' or 'faciebat', the names of other persons who are equally unrecorded as is Ioannes Bartholomaeus. The first of these is the Compagnia del Falcone , without imprint but easily attributable to the press of Gian Stefano di Carlo da Pavia at Florence about 1520. This ends with the words 'Tantalus Marochus faciebat'. Neither Dr. Bühler, who owns the book, nor I have ever come across this man's name elsewhere as author, printer, publisher or editor. 4 Secondly, there is the case of three books by Lancinus Curtius of which I have examined the copies in the British Museum and in All Souls College, Oxford. They are his Epigrammaton libri decem ; the same, decados secundae ; and Sylvarum libri decem . Each of these was printed at Milan in 1521 and each has the same imprint: Mediolani, apud Rochum &amp; Ambrosium fratres de Valle impressores; Philippus Foyot faciebat. Here it will be seen that Rochus and Ambrosius de Valle are clearly stated to be printers. The British Museum's holdings show that the brothers Rochus and Ambrosius de Valle (principally active from 1517 to 1521) almost invariably printed on commission for the bookseller Nicolaus de Gorgonzola, who as far as we know was never a printer himself. Their other colophons make this clear. Philippus Foyot is to me otherwise unknown. What was his role? It is obvious that Ioannes Bartholomaeus in Venice in 1507, Tantalus Marochus in Florence about 1520, and Philippus Foyot at Milan in 1521, were not authors, editors (in the modern English sense) or printers; nor were they publishers. If the colophons had meant to say 'fieri fecit' in the sense of 'published' or 'commissioned', they would surely have said so. I believe that the simple use of the verb 'facere' in these examples, which must have been quite clear to customers at the time but is far less intelligible to us, indicates that the man who supplies his name in this way was the chief type-setter or compositor of the press. He was otherwise a character whose name would not be likely to be recorded for posterity; but there was nothing to prevent him from adding his name at the end of a book just as the scribe of a manuscript might have added his name with the word 'scripsit' but be otherwise completely unknown as a calligrapher; and it was often a matter of complete indifference to the owner of an early press whether he put a colophon in a book or not, or indeed what information he put in the colophon and what he left out. There were no rules. It will be observed that my three examples all come from the first quarter of the sixteenth century and all come from Italian books. I have not yet found a parallel case in the incunable period; nor have I looked for examples of the use of 'facere' in the colophons of books printed outside Italy; but I have by chance seen the verb 'formavit' once used in the same position. 5</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Observations on the 1562 Editions of Cardinal Reginald Pole's De Concilio and Reformatio Angliae by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1562, four years after the death of Reginald Pole, four editions 1 of the De concilio and of the Reformatio Angliae by the Cardinal were put in print by three presses. Although it should have been entirely self-evident which editions were the first printings of both tracts, contrary views have, from time to time, been set forth. The account given in the Dictionary of National Biography 2 states only that the De concilio "appeared in Venice in 1562," while Herzog-Hauck 3 claims that the Dillingen edition is the editio princeps . In accordance with the British Museum's cataloguing rules, 4 the Venice edition of this tract precedes the Roman one in its Short-Title Catalogue . 5 But this arrangement is due solely to the fact that the Venetian edition is a collected one of opuscula 6 and thus is listed before the separate printings of these treatises. It is unequivocally certain that the Roman edition of the De concilio , dated 1562 and with ten lines of errata , represents the first appearance in print of this tract. 7 Similarly, the Roman printing of the Reformatio Angliae , also dated 1562 and with a single line of errata , is certainly the first edition of that work. 8 This may be predicated on the fact that all four of the editions of the De concilio contain the preface by Paulus Manutius. It seems absolutely inconceivable that any printer in Venice or Dillingen could have obtained the text of this preface before Paolo had printed it himself. The first edition of the De concilio having been established through this and other evidence, as set forth in the study cited in note 7, a similar line of argument in determining priority can be applied to the Reformatio Angliae , 9 with the result noted above. That the four editions are somehow related is also indicated by an omission common to all four. The De concilio consists of 86 questions and responses — but there is no Quaestio XXXIX in any of them. However, the first Roman edition and the two non-Roman ones restore the count by repeating the heading Quaestio XLI. The second Rome edition does not repeat no. XLI, so that thereafter there is always a numerical gap between it and the other three, this edition ending with Quaestio LXXXVII where the others have Quaestio LXXXVI. It can be argued, I think, that if either the V or D editions had used the second Roman printing as their copy, the numbering would have agreed with that edition. This suggests that V and D were either set up from R1 or that one was set from R1 and that the other copied this. 10 That D was set from R1 can further be shown by a number of misprints which these editions have in common. 11 In R1 (25.b.7), one finds the phrase: "ut ad minutissimæ quæque legis obseruanda iidem promptos se ostenderint." With this D agrees. However, the third word should read "minutissima" as modifying "obseruanda" and both R2 and V have the correct form. This is further evidence to suggest that D was set from R1. 12 Again, in R1 (32.a.19/21), the text reads "habuit in ea ciuitate" which V also prints (52.a.2), though the errata emends to the plural "habuerunt." R2, at the same place, offers "habuerunt in ciuitate" while D has the text of R1 as corrected by the errata ("habuerunt in ea ciuitate"). Clearly, it is quite certain that V was set from R1, and it is highly probable that D was here following the corrected R1 rather than R2, though in certain other instances (as will be shown) D follows uncorrected R1. The examples cited here demonstrate, of course, the independence of D and V from one another. Similar arguments can be advanced in the case of the several editions of the Reformatio Angliae . In R1 (6.b.13), the text reads: "in uniuersum orbem terræ primatum." Here the errata substitutes "tenere primatum" for "terræ primatum." R2 prints the corrected text and V (100.b.7) concurs in this reading. But D (folio 184 verso) preserves the erroneous text of R1! Since D could hardly have arrived at this misreading by coincidence, it follows that D must have used R1 as a Vorlage . Again, in 18.b.24, R1 has an erasure after the ampersand in the sequence "purgati, &amp; [ ] qua." The compositor of R2 was apparently unaware of this correction and set the original, uncorrected text of R1: "purgati; &amp; ea, qua." But both D and V print the corrected text of R1, not that of R2. What, then, are the results of this investigation? That R1 of both the De concilio and of the Reformatio Angliae represent the first printings of these texts can hardly be questioned. D and V, in turn, are independent of one another 13 — and both of them, together with R2, derive from R1. Which of these is the second edition cannot be determined from internal evidence, and no chronological details are available to us to aid in finding the answer. Probably the Dillingen edition is the last of these four — an opinion largely based, and perhaps too presumptively, on the remoteness of the German town from Venice and Rome. But whether Ziletti issued his Venetian "piracy" before or after Paulus Manutius got around to reprinting his editio princeps must remain a matter of speculation until further evidence comes to hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The De concilio and the Reformatio Angliae are here treated as a unit, though the Roman editions were so printed that they could be sold either separately or together. In the other two editions, the two tracts form a single book with continuous pagination. The editions and their sigla are: Rome: Paulus Manutius, 1562 — R1 (for both texts) Rome: Paulus Manutius, 1562 — R2 (for both texts) Venice: Giordano Ziletti, 1562 — V Dillingen: Sebald Mayer, 1562 — D See also Antoine Augustin Renouard, Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde (1834), pp. 185-186, and Otto Bucher, Bibliographie der deutschen Drucke des XVI.

In R 1 and R 2 the De baptismo Constantini is printed with the De concilio . 7 For further remarks on these Roman editions, see my "Paulus Manutius and his first Roman Printings," PBSA , 46 (1952), 209-214. 8 The errata of R1 were incorporated in R2. 9 See Bühler, pp. 213-214. 10 In the De baptismo Constantini , the errata of R1 suggests that (in 60.b.23) "semper professus" should be corrected to read "semper est professus." However, R2 prints "semper professus est." Since both V and D follow the correction as in R1, it may be assumed that they did not use R2 as their copy. 11 In 59.a.13, R1 has been altered, by means of pen and ink, so that "conciliorum" reads "consiliorum." D follows uncorrected R1, while R2 and V adopt the new reading of R1. 12 R1 (60.b.11) corrects "acta" to read "actae" by an ink emendation. Again D follows the original reading of R1, while R2 and V both make the correction. See Bühler, p. 212. 13 By following the erasure in R1 of the "n" in "ante," R2 and D read (59.b.15) "iam a te dictum est." V, however, preserves the uncorrected text of R1; see Bühler, p. 212, no. 11. Since V sometimes accepts the corrections and at other times prints the original text where D does the direct opposite, it seems certain that D and V must be quite independent of one another. Sometimes V differs from the three other texts. Thus, in 13.b.1 in the De concilio , R1 has "cum eum principium" in common with R2 and D — but V omits "eum." In 2.a.15 of R1 and R2 (and so in D), we read: "legatis sunt communes" but V omits the "sunt." Similarly, in the Reformatio Angliae , R1 (26.b.21) in common with R2 and D has "an eorum bona" where V (127.a.14) alone prints "an uerò bona."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Plots of The Dead Man's Fortune and 2 Seven Deadly Sins : Inferences for Theatre Historians by Scott McMillin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two of the extant theatrical "plots" from the Elizabethan playhouses — those of The Dead Man's Fortune and The Second Part of the Seven Deadly Sins — pose a special problem for theatre historians. On the one hand, we find in these manuscripts our most extensive evidence for the personnel of major acting companies in the obscure years of 1589-1594; on the other, because those years are obscure, we do not know how to interpret the extensive evidence. The plots are related to each other in some way, for they both name "Burbage" as an actor (presumably Richard Burbage) and they both seem to have been in the possession of Edward Alleyn. 1 But Burbage is the only actor named in both plots — the nineteen other names in 2 Seven Deadly Sins do not correspond to the three other names in The Dead Man's Fortune — and we are thus confronted with evidence that the two most famous Elizabethan actors were associated for a time, even as the same evidence fails to prove in which company of players the association occurred. Moreover, some of the actors named in the manuscripts correspond to leading members of the Chamberlain's men in 1594-95, raising hopes that the plots bear upon Shakespeare's early years in the theatre; but Shakespeare is not named in either one. The years of 1589 to 1594 are the hardest period for historians of the Elizabethan theatre, for the constitution of the acting companies, the theatres in which they played, and the playwrights whose works they performed all share in the obscurity which blankets the "lost years" of the Shakespeare biography. From this narrow gap of time come two manuscript plots, offering fuller details than we normally expect from such papers, and refusing to tell us exactly what we want to know. The answers to all questions are not at hand, but I think the two plots deserve fresh examination. The last full comparison was performed some forty years ago, when Greg and Chambers, conducting their superlative studies of the Elizabethan stage, found that their interpretations of the plots remained in disagreement. In undertaking a new examination of the documents, I wish to accomplish two purposes: 1) to bring that longstanding disagreement to something of a conclusion, if Greg and Chambers were right in their shared assumptions about the dates of the plots; 2) on the possibility that they were wrong about the dates, to raise a new speculation about the provenance of The Dead Man's Fortune . Greg and Chambers agreed that both plots must date from before May of 1591, on the grounds that a professional association between Burbage and Alleyn would have been unlikely after the argument which had occurred by that time between the Burbage family and Alleyn's company of actors. 2 According to this view, Alleyn and others of the Admiral's men were playing at James Burbage's the Theatre prior to the argument. They are supposed to have been cooperating in some way with Strange's men at this time, for the Court records of 1590-91 interchange the names of the two companies. Chambers held that the cooperation was in effect an amalgamation which lasted from approximately 1590 to 1594 and that the two plots come from one company, probably from the amalgamated company, in 1590 or early 1591. Greg argued that the two companies ordinarily acted separately before May of 1591, the joint performances at Court having been an occasional association; thus the plot of 2 Seven Deadly Sins represents Strange's men acting alone at the Curtain, while the plot of The Dead Man's Fortune represents the Admiral's men at the Theatre. The appearance of Burbage's name in both plots Greg explained on the assumption that the young actor was attached to his father's playhouse interests rather than to any one company and acted at both the Theatre and the Curtain. A close study of the manuscripts, I submit, reveals a considerable contrast in the casting of the two plays and renders unlikely the view that the plots originated with one company in the brief span of 1590-91. 2 Seven Deadly Sins represents a large organization, perhaps the largest of which we have record before the turn of the century. The plot records the names, at least in part, of twenty actors and includes two major roles (Henry VI and Lydgate) for which the actors are not named and which could not have been doubled from the specified twenty. 3 Also unnamed are the actors of the seven deadly sins and of Mercury (who appears, for reasons unknown, at the end), but since these roles could to some extent have been doubled by the named actors, we can only say that the company included between twenty-two and twenty-nine performers. At least six of these were boys, for they played female roles; the rest, we assume, were men. Since the action is framed as three playlets, treating separately the themes of Envy, Sloth, and Lechery, the number of characters is large. The plot shows thirty-five named roles and twenty-seven unnamed — demands which correspond to the heavier history plays of the early 1590's — but aside from the problem of casting the seven sins in the opening scene, the company was able to handle the succession of roles without excessive doubling. Thomas Pope and Augustine Phillips, for example, who performed leading roles in the second playlet, were not called upon in the first and third, and more than half the company was free from performing in at least one of the segments. Walk-on parts are generously assigned: the "some attendants" of scene iii turns out to be four; six soldiers are named in scenes iv and v, and at least four captains in scenes xiii and xvi. The Dead Man's Fortune reveals a different situation. At first glance it seems easier to cast than 2 Seven Deadly Sins , having only about half as many parts. But the action alternates between a main plot of romantic characteristics (apparently a story of young lovers saved by a magician's influence upon their obstructing elders) and a sub-plot derived from the commedia tradition (apparently a story of a cuckolded Pantalone), and when these strands come together at the conclusion, some twenty-one to twenty-three performers being on stage together, there are signs in the manuscript that the company was forced to expedients of casting which the ample personnel of the Sins company did not face. As Greg recognized, the conclusion is arranged to allow actors from the sub-plot to double several of the roles added to the main plot in this scene. 4 What has slipped by unnoticed is the particular playhouse maneuver which allowed this doubling to occur. In the margin of the manuscript are some notes for a scene to be inserted just prior to the large conclusion, and this appears to have been a late addition — a piece of vamping, probably — to allow the necessary doubling by the sub-plot actors. The marginal addition, of course, did not escape Greg's eye. He explained it as a correction to an error on the part of the scribe, who earlier in his work had been forced to correct just such a mistake. The scribe had begun the plot on what is now the reverse side, but after a few lines, discovering that he had omitted a scene, he abandoned this attempt, turned the board over, and wrote the plot on the other side. Thus the marginal addition toward the end seemed to Greg the second example of an absentminded scribe. But the marginal addition toward the end, as Greg noticed, was written not by the scribe but by a playhouse annotator, who also added calls for music during four intervals in the action. The playhouse annotator was obviously concerned with details of production, and his marginal addition, written in haphazard language which does not resemble the usual formulas of the plots, and supplying a scene which Greg admitted (pp. 103-104) was not integral to the action, looks like a late insertion intended to serve a pragmatic theatrical purpose. That purpose seems to have concerned the doubling of roles in the conclusion. Without the insertion, the sub-plot actors would have appeared in the scene preceding the conclusion. With the insertion, which involves five characters from the main plot, the sub-plot actors would have gained time to dress for their doubled roles in the conclusion. 5 This interpretation is hardly conclusive in itself, but the manuscript gives other evidence that casting was a problem, particularly in the smaller roles. For one thing, the only performers named, aside from one reference to Burbage, are "Darlowe," "Robart lee," and "b samme," these three having slight parts in several places, and the "tyre man," who appears once. For a playhouse functionary like the tire-man (from the tiring-house) to be pressed into service is not a unique occurrence in theatrical documents, but it does indicate that the regular actors fell short of filling out the scene. What happened in The Dead Man's Fortune is clear enough. The tire-man was forced to serve as an attendant to characters named Tesephon and Allgerius in IV, i (Greg's division). Now Tesephon and Allgerius were accompanied by attendants in two earlier scenes, lighter in demands of casting, and in both cases the attendants were played by Darlowe, Lee, and "samme." In IV, i, however, two speaking roles occur which do not figure elsewhere — a messenger and one Euphrodore — and the plot assigns these parts to Lee and "samme," the attendants being left to Darlowe and the tire-man. 6 In terms of casting, IV, i occurs in the most demanding section of the play apart from the large final scene, 7 and it seems reasonable to conclude that the marginally-added scene toward the end was intended to solve the same kind of problem which the tire-man was called upon to solve in IV, i. The composition of the company can be determined with reasonable precision from this information. Since the four female roles cannot be doubled, the organization must have included four boys. Darlowe, Lee, and "samme" appear to have formed the entire group of regular supernumeraries, for it is when two of them are assigned brief speaking roles in IV, i that the tire-man is called into play. The rest of the adult actors played important speaking roles — that is, named roles which recur throughout — and they seem to have numbered eleven. Greg estimated their number at ten, but he assumed that King Egereon, who appears only in the long concluding scene, would have been played by a supernumerary. Kings, even late-arriving kings, do not usually walk on in Elizabethan plays, and since this king remains throughout the long conclusion, I assume that his role was important enough to be played by an experienced actor. 8 This company estimated at eighteen — four boys, three supernumeraries, and eleven capable men — cannot easily be identified with the company of between twenty-two and twenty-nine players for whom the plot of 2 Seven Deadly Sins was prepared. Darlowe, Lee, and "samme" do not appear among the twenty named actors of the Sins plot, nor does the Sins plot show signs of the kind of casting problems which the company of Dead Man's Fortune maneuvered to solve. The handwritings of the two manuscripts do not correspond. Aside from the appearance of Burbage's name in both plots, and aside from the likelihood that Alleyn possessed both manuscripts, there is nothing to suggest that 2 Seven Deadly Sins and The Dead Man's Fortune had the same provenance. Chambers' theory that the plots originated with one company in a brief period of its career appears to be incorrect. Yet we cannot simply affirm Greg's opinion and bring matters to a comfortable conclusion. The difficulty is that while Greg was probably right to argue that the plots imply separate companies, his identification of those companies as Strange's men and the Admiral's men involves some troublesome elements. To suppose that Burbage's name appears in both plots because he shuttled between the two companies rather falters in the absence of any example of an Elizabethan player similarly related to different organizations. Moreover, of the two organizations to which Greg assigned Burbage in 1590-91, we cannot be certain that one, the Admiral's men, existed at that time as a distinct company in London. The company's existence is always assumed , but the assumption lacks solid grounding in fact. Edward Alleyn and his brother John retained their personal designations as servants to the Lord Admiral in the early 1590's, but when we search for their fellow "Admiral's men" in London we come to the name of James Tunstall and no more. 9 Some "Admiral's men" were touring the provinces in the early 1590's, and some left for the continent in 1592, 10 but records for an Admiral's company acting in London between 3 March 1590 (when they certainly appeared at Court) and 14 May 1594 (when they reorganized under Alleyn's leadership and opened at Henslowe's playhouse) are curiously uncertain. In fact there are only two such records, and they occur in the Court documents for 1590-91 which interchange the company's name with Strange's men. It appears unlikely that there was a London company of Admiral's men in the early 1590's — a point that needs to be stressed because a good deal of the theatre history written for this period fails to notice it — and rather more likely that the Alleyn brothers, retaining their personal standing as servants to the Lord Admiral and accompanied by Tunstall, were performing with Strange's men at the Theatre in 1590-91. In the face of uncertainties such as these, while allowing that Greg's argument for the separate origins of the plots seems accurate, we cannot easily accept his specific conclusion that The Dead Man's Fortune represents the Admiral's men and a free-lancing Burbage. A new working hypothesis would be encouraging, and the best way to locate a new hypothesis is to consider further the most specific evidence at hand, the evidence in the plot itself. If it seems likely that the playhouse annotator of The Dead Man's Fortune inserted the marginal scene in order to solve a problem of doubling, our best inference is that the company had undergone a reduction in personnel which necessitated a late adjustment of this sort. The small number of supernumeraries indicated in the plot and the use of the tire-man to fill out a scene strengthen this impression. Moreover, it is a peculiarity of this plot (compared to the other known examples) that it includes no systematic naming of actors. Apart from Burbage (whose name, as Greg noticed, must have been accidentally substituted for the name of his role), only the supernumeraries are mentioned. The plot rather appears to have been prepared for a company already familiar with the play but forced by a reduction in personnel to adjust the casting; the adjustments made the assignments of the supernumeraries important enough to record, called a theatre functionary into costume, and required an additional scene prior to the final large grouping of characters. Now the London companies often had to tour the provinces in the early 1590's, and (as Chambers noticed) a touring company would ordinarily have sought economy by reducing their number of lesser actors or "hired men." 11 The characteristics of The Dead Man's Fortune fit well with the situation we should imagine for a company on tour, while the characteristics of 2 Seven Deadly Sins seem appropriate to the greater stability and larger numbers of a company acting in London. Since the usual interpretation assigns 2 Seven Deadly Sins to Strange's men in 1590-91, when they were a prominent London company and Burbage was almost certainly acting with them (this element is common to the theories of Greg and Chambers), we have no reason to seek a new explanation for that plot. For The Dead Man's Fortune , however, we should ask if there is evidence of a touring company in which Burbage may have acted (not to mention Darlowe, Lee, "samme," and the tire-man), and which can be connected to Alleyn in such a way as to explain how the manuscript came into his possession. So long as May of 1591 is taken as the later limit of The Dead Man's Fortune , as Greg and Chambers assumed, little can be said about provincial tours. The Admiral's men toured often in 1590-May, 1591, but they are unlikely, as I have indicated above, to have been related to the plots. Strange's men, who have a closer bearing on one of the plots, do not appear in the provincial records during this period; indeed, they seem to have taken special pains to continue acting in London. 12 Although many theatrical events which could have involved Burbage, Alleyn, and The Dead Man's Fortune have disappeared from view, on the surface of information for 1590-May, 1591, we cannot observe specific occurrences which relate to the manuscript's indications of revision for a reduced company. We have reason to think, however, that May of 1591 should not be taken as the later limit for The Dead Man's Fortune , for it is entirely possible that Burbage and Alleyn were associated at a later time. As Greg proved in his edition of Henslowe's Diary , for ten days in June of 1594 the reorganized Admiral's men and the new Chamberlain's men collaborated at Newington Butts. 13 Alleyn certainly led the Admiral's men at that time, and there is no reason to doubt that Burbage, named as a payee for the Chamberlain's men in the Court records of 1594-95, belonged to that company from its inception. Until now, this has been regarded as an isolated sign of cooperation between the two companies and a slender basis for imagining a "professional association" between the two leading actors. After the ten days in June, the companies certainly went their separate ways, Alleyn and Burbage becoming popular rivals to one another. Isolated signs of cooperation are in themselves a little odd, however, and there is a possibility that earlier in 1594 the actors who would collaborate in June, presumably including Alleyn and Burbage, entered upon a first stage of their association at Henslowe's Rose. A company known as Sussex's men played two brief seasons for Henslowe early in 1594, and their repertory included Titus Andronicus and The Jew of Malta , two plays not otherwise known in relation to the Sussex company. Since both plays were also performed during the ten days at Newington Butts, the possibility arises that the Sussex's seasons at the Rose and the Admiral's-Chamberlain's cooperation at Newington Butts belonged to a single process in the reorganization of the London companies. This is not the place to present the argument about Sussex's men in detail. I mention it only to give additional edge to the possibility, and nothing more than the possibility, of an association between Burbage and Alleyn not only for the ten days in June, but also for five or six months before. There is no reason to assume that May of 1591 is the last time when a manuscript plot involving Burbage could have come into Alleyn's possession. And that raises a new possibility for the provenance of The Dead Man's Fortune . For more than two years after May of 1591, Alleyn and Strange's men, separating from the Burbage interests at the Theatre, moved to Henslowe's Rose for their London seasons and traveled in the country when the plague ran high in the City. One wonders what Richard Burbage was doing at that time. One wonders a little more poignantly what Shakespeare was doing too, and whether he was with Burbage. Neither can be located in Strange's men, and according to current estimates we should look to a company of brief existence called Pembroke's men, who apparently formed as an offshoot of Strange's men, perhaps in May of 1591, became prominent enough to play at Court in the Christmas season of 1592-93, spent much of their short time in the provinces, performed at least three Shakespearean plays, and foundered in the summer of 1593. 14 Soon thereafter, three of their plays were published in what we have learned to call "bad quartos" — reported versions of plays probably cut down for provincial touring. These are The Taming of A Shrew and the quarto versions of 2 and 3 Henry VI . A thorough study of the constitution of this company as it can be inferred from these reduced texts remains to be made, 15 but at the moment I see nothing to rule out the possibility that the plot of The Dead Man's Fortune , with its record of Burbage's name, with a possible date after May of 1591, with signs of revision for a reduced company, and with indications of the small number of hired men we would expect for a provincial tour, originated with Pembroke's men in 1592-93 and came into Alleyn's possession during the first half of 1594. With that as a working hypothesis, matters come to a pause. The constitution of Pembroke's men is a difficult subject which cannot be encompassed here. For the moment, we can only notice that the manuscript evidence raises the possibility of a connection between The Dead Man's Fortune and Pembroke's men without affording proof. Once again, the plots refuse to tell us exactly what we want to know. Darlowe, Lee, and "samme" are silent on the matter, and the tire-man is no help at all.</field>

The companion volume of reproductions and transcripts provides the best text of the plots. 2 E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare : A Study of Facts and Problems (1930), I, 48-52; Greg, Documents : Commentary , pp. 16-19. The argument was related to the Burbage-Brayne controversy, documented by C. W. Wallace, The First London Theatre : Materials for a History , Nebraska Univ. Studies, Vol. 13 (1913), and summarized in E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage (1923), II, 387-395. 3 "Vincent" appears only once, as a musician in scene xiii, and he may have been more a playhouse musician than a regular actor. But the distinction between "musician" and "actor" cannot be sharply drawn for Elizabethan performers, who usually knew several crafts. The manuscript shows that originally two actor-musicians (Cowly and Sincler) were cast in this scene, the "2" being changed to "3" when Vincent became available. 4 Documents : Commentary , pp. 99-101. I follow Greg's interpretation that the concluding episodes form one continuous scene. It may be added that for the three "antique faires" who dance into the conclusion, the plot specifies serial entrances and exits. Since similar serial entrances follow for Validore, Asspida, and Rose from the sub-plot, these groups of three roles apiece were probably doubled. 5 Some of the revisions in The Book of Sir Thomas More probably served a similar purpose, as I have explained in " The Book of Sir Thomas More : A Theatrical View," MP , 68 (1970), 10-24. Greg might have assumed that the "Musique" signaled before the start of the concluding scene provided an interval for the doubling, but we cannot assume that this was more than a momentary pause. A similar call for music before IV, i did not meet the casting problem that the tire-man had to solve. Wilfred T. Jewkes, Act Division in Elizabethan and Jacobean Plays : 1583-1616 (Hamdon, Conn., 1958), pp. 96-103, concludes that act intervals of the kind Greg seems to have had in mind were not a practice in the public theatres before 1607. 6 At first glance it appears that Burbage played the messenger, but Greg's interpretation, the only one to account for every detail in this scene, must be correct: Burbage's name was entered in mistake for the name of his major role, and the messenger was a separate part played by Lee. ( Documents : Commentary , pp. 102-103.) 7 By a "section" of the play I mean a group of three successive scenes. The most demanding sections are: IV, vi-V, ii, twenty-one to twenty-three roles; III, iv-IV, ii, nineteen roles; several sections between II, ii and II, vi, sixteen roles. 8 The supernumeraries would have been busy with the "Officers" and "Lords" who enter with Egereon; one fears that the tireman might have been summoned again at this point. It should occur to students of such details that in an Elizabethan repertory company the royal costumes, expensive and used in various plays, would have been fitted to leading actors. 9 As Greg noticed in Documents : Commentary , p. 16n. What has confused the matter is John Alleyn's testimony in the Burbage-Brayne case (Wallace, First London Theatre , p. 101), where he refers to the Lord Admiral's patronage. This has always been taken as proving that "the Admiral's men" were playing at the Theatre in 1590-May, 1591, but it is equally possible that Alleyn was referring to his and his brother's standing as personal servants to the Lord Admiral. That Edward Alleyn retained this standing is well-known from the Privy Council warrant of 6 May 1593 in behalf of Strange's men (Chambers, Elizabethan Stage , II, 123). John Alleyn was afforded special attention as the Admiral's servant in Privy Council business of 14 July 1589; that he used to dwell with the Lord Admiral is mentioned in a letter of 22 September 1612. See G. F. Warner, Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Muniments at Dulwich College (1881), p. 85 and p. 98. 10 The provincial visits are recorded in Chambers, William Shakespeare , II, 306-307, and Giles E. Dawson, Records of Plays and Players in Kent : 1450-1642 , Malone Society Collections, Vol. 7 (1965), p. 175. The continental trip of 1592 has been misunderstood. Chambers supposed that in issuing a passport to certain performers the Lord Admiral was acting in his official capacity, not as the players' patron ( Elizabethan Stage , II, 274). Unfortunately, the important phrase estants mes joueurs et serviteurs does not appear in Chambers' transcription. For a complete transcription and the correct interpretation that the actors were from the Admiral's men, see Erik Wikland, Elizabethan Players in Sweden : 1591-92 , trans. Patrick Hort (Stockholm, 1962), p. 99. 11 Elizabethan Stage , I, 331-332. 12 I refer to the petitions from Strange's men and Henslowe to the Privy Council, as interpreted in Chambers, William Shakespeare , I, 43.

      <field name="heading_text">Annotations by Coleridge in a Copy of The Friend (1818) by Peter Mann</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Barbara E. Rooke's edition of The Friend for the Collected Coleridge , 1 Appendix C provides the reader with a descriptive list of all known annotated copies of The Friend in its three-volume edition of 1818. Item 10 on this list is "Thomas Fanshaw Middleton's copy", concerning which Miss Rooke writes: Not located or described. This copy is known only from the ms transcript recorded in Blackwell Catalogue 570 , lot 751: "The notes in ink at end of Vol. III were transcribed from S.T.C.'s own MS. notes in a copy presented by him to Bp. Middleton, his old school friend." Middleton (1769-1822), C's friend at Christ's Hospital and at Jesus College, Cambridge, New Testament scholar, and Bishop of Calcutta (1814). 2 We now know, however, that Coleridge did in fact intend an annotated copy of The Friend (1818) for Bishop Middleton though it is not clear whether he received it or not, or what subsequently happened to it. On December 31, 1820, Coleridge wrote to the Rev. H. F. Carey that he was about to prepare a packet containing "a corrected Copy of my Friend and of the Lay Sermons". Carey's son, William, who was about to embark for India with his regiment, was to deliver the packet to Middleton, along with a letter of introduction from Coleridge which had been particularly requested by Mrs. Carey. Coleridge would have liked to send Middleton a copy of Biographia Literaria as well, but it was out of print and he had no copy available. 3 It is uncertain whether William Carey was able to receive the packet before embarkation, for on January 8, 1821, Coleridge wrote again to H. F. Carey expressing his anxiety about its fate. "I am left uncertain whether the Parcel sent from here on Wednesday last and inclosing the Books and Letter reached you in time for Mr William to have it. I need not say, that this has caused &amp; causes me no little anxiety—I shall wish my corrections at the ( Printer's ) Devil, if the Delay occasioned by them &amp; which with the search for a Messenger put off their final departure from our House till past One o/clock, should have belated the Letter &amp; Books. — Pray, give me one Line just to say — Yea or No." 4 I am unaware whether Carey replied with a Yea or a No, and the subsequent history of the annotated copy of The Friend (and of the Lay Sermons) remains, for the time being at least, a mystery. However, though the annotated copy of The Friend (1818) intended for Middleton remains unlocated, there is in my possession the copy of the edition of 1818 described in the Blackwell catalogue as containing notes transcribed from Middleton's copy, and this does in fact contain a small number of manuscript emendations and corrections (some with the initials "STC"), including a marginal note of considerable interest that is not to be found, so far as I have been able to discover, in any other edition or annotated copy. The notes appear in volume III on pages 255-57 and 262-64. They are mostly in a clear blue ink of uncertain age, but a few are in pencil. I have been unable either to identify the copyist or to determine what the history of this copy was before it appeared on Blackwell's shelves in 1951. Coleridge annotated or corrected several copies of The Friend (1818) and Miss Rooke has incorporated in her textual notes the emendations in the known surviving copies. 5 It is impossible to determine whether the notes in the present copy were transcribed directly from the corrected copy prepared for Middleton (now lost or unlocated), or whether they had some other source. Coleridge's annotations were much prized by his admirers and friends, who made a practice of enriching their personal copies of his works by transcribing his marginalia into them, often placing Coleridge's initials by them to indicate their authenticity. 6 Very shortly after publication of The Friend (1818) Coleridge sent to a few of his friends various corrections, at least some of which he anticipated would be transcribed into still other copies, 7 and it is not impossible that the notes in Middleton's copy were transcribed in this way or that some other record of them was made. Whatever uncertainty there may be, however, about the mode of transmission in the case of the notes in the present copy, there can be no doubt, I believe, about their authenticity or about their Coleridgian origin. The emendations are as follows. In volume III, page 255, line 11, after the words "to the giant tree of the forest," a manuscript note inserts "from the mole that burrows at its roots"; the initials STC stand in the margin. On the same page, line 20, "and by which" is deleted and the words "Hence too it is that" substituted; the comma after "class" is converted into a period. On line 22 "then" is inserted after "if we". On line 25 after the words "shall we not hold it probable that" a note inserts "by some analogous intervention". On lines 25 and 26 of the same page and on line 1 of the next page (256) these words are deleted: "of universal and general laws by an adequate intervention of appropriate agency, will have been effected"; in their place is supplied: "will have been effected for the rational and moral ? Are we not entitled to expect some appropriate agency in behalf of the presiding and alone progressive creature? To presume some especial provision". On page 256, line 3, "progressively" is deleted and "and grow" substituted, and on line 4 "idea" is deleted and replaced by "Humanity". On line 5 "all" is underlined. Before "outward relations of matter" on line 15, the word "changes" is inserted. 8 On line 16 "them" is substituted for "these", and the phrase "phenomena in time and space" is deleted. 9 On page 262, line 21, after the words "instrument of the former —" a manuscript addition (initialed "STC") reads: "when it would itself be its own Life and Verity". 10 In Copies A, D, H, and L a long additional paragraph has been inserted on page 263 after the paragraph ending at line 7 with the words "whose transparency hath no vacuum." 11 A similar passage may have been inserted in Middleton's copy also for in the margin of the copy in my possession, at line 7, are the words: "Here insert the ms paragraphs below." At the foot of the page, however, the copyist has gone no further than to write the abbreviation §§. A few emendations appear in pencil on page 264. On line 9 in the sentence ending "of which it had been the quarry and remains the foundation", the words "had been" and "remains" are underlined and the initials "STC" stand in the margin. In the passage "this life in the idea, even in the supreme and godlike, which alone merits the name of life," the word "idea" (line 12) is underlined twice and after "godlike" (line 13) is inserted the word "life". These small variations do not appear in Friend (1837) or in other annotated copies of the 1818 edition. The most interesting of these emendations is a note written across the foot of pages 256 and 257 (of Volume III) apparently intended to illustrate part of the lengthy argument which begins on page 254 at the point where Coleridge recapitulates the traditional argument from design—"Look round you and you behold everywhere an adaptation of means to ends . . . the material world must have been made for the sake of man." More particularly the note relates to the passage on page 255 where Coleridge affirms that "in all inferior things from the grass on the house top to the giant tree of the forest, to the eagle which builds in its summit, and the elephant which browses on its branches, we behold—first, a subjection to universal laws by which each thing belongs to the Whole, as interpenetrated by the powers of the Whole; and, secondly, the intervention of particular laws by which the universal laws are suspended or tempered for the weal and sustenance of each particular class ." This passage, especially the words I have placed in italics, marks an important turning point in Coleridge's argument in this section of The Friend , for he goes on to argue that there is an analogous "intervention" in the case of a fundamental law of human nature, without which man's intellectual and spiritual progression would have been impaired. It would have been helpful if at this point Coleridge had supplied the reader with some instances, drawn from the non-human creation, of universal laws "suspended or tempered", as he states, by the "intervention of particular laws . . . for the weal and sustenance" of each particular class. The omission is to some extent remedied, however, by the following note in the copy of The Friend which is the subject of this article: Note The 16+16 = 32 days of Light obtained by the Greenlanders by the secondary Laws of Refraction; that Ice is the one exception to the General Law of Contraction by cold, to which exception the Planet owes its habitability, and clay the one exception to the general law of dilatation by heat, without which exception a hot summer would sentence every clay soil to sterility are three striking instances among hundreds less obvious STC. Though not itself lacking in obscurity this note serves to illustrate his argument at a point where it needs illustration; it also provides further evidence of the range of Coleridge's reading and some insight into his processes of mind. In the background to Coleridge's allusion to the extra days of light enjoyed by the Greenlanders lies the common eighteenth-century belief that the laws of nature and the physical geography of the countries of the far north had been so disposed by the divine wisdom as to mitigate the rigours of life there for their inhabitants. Coleridge was familiar with David Crantz's History of Greenland , which first appeared in English translation in 1767. 12 Livingston Lowes long ago pointed out how deeply Coleridge's reading of this work affected the poetic atmosphere and imagery of The Ancient Mariner and of other poems by Coleridge, 13 but Crantz's History also forms part of the intellectual background to Coleridge's note to The Friend . Crantz found that in Greenland the nature of the atmosphere in such high latitudes brought certain benefits to the Greenlanders. "In summer there is no night at all in this country . . . In June and July it is so light here all night long, that a person may read or write the smallest characters in a room without a candle . . . This is of great benefit to the Greenlanders, who in their short summer can hunt and fish all the night through; and also to the sailors, who would otherwise run great hazard from the quantities of ice. . . . On the other hand the winter-nights are so much the longer . . . the face of the sun is never seen above the horizon from Nov. 30 to Jan. 12. During that period the inhabitants enjoy but a moderate twilight . . . And yet there are never such quite dark nights here, as there are in other countries . . . people can do very well out of doors without a lanthorn, and can see plainly to read print . . . And even if the moon does not shine in the winter, the northern lights, with their sportive streams of variegated colours, often supply its place still better." 14 The theological implications of Crantz's observations were brought out by the translator in his footnotes to a new edition of Crantz's work which appeared in 1820. "It is a strong argument in favour of the infinite wisdom of Him who planned the system of Nature, that even those results which seem necessarily to follow from the consistent operation of the different elements, in various circumstances, upon each other, generally answer some particular end in the wide economy of the Universe." 15 Hans Egede, too, in his A Description of Greenland noted that "the Almighty God and good God, who has not in vain created the vast globe of the Earth, has also not intended, that any part or province of it should lie buried in eternal oblivion, useless to mankind." Egede, like Crantz, points to the beneficent effects of the kind of light to be found in Greenland. 16 An explanation of Coleridge's allusion to the 16 + 16 = 32 extra days of light granted to the Greenlanders may be found in one of the works of Bernhard Varenius (1622-1650), the most celebrated of the geographers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, whose Geographia generalis; in qua affectiones generales telluris explicantur was first published in Amsterdam in 1650. 17 Like later works of its kind it included not only a systematic account of physical geography and astronomy, but also much information and technical matter about meteorology, the climates of the world, navigation and mathematics. Many topics of particular interest to Coleridge are discussed with much learning, including subterranean fires, the polar regions, the air, winds, water and other elements, the sun and moon, the aurora borealis, rainbows, and atmospheric phenomena of all kinds. Of particular relevance to The Friend is Varenius's account (in Section VI, chapter xix) of the primary laws relating to the refraction of light in different media. "Experience testifies, that the Rays coming from any Object out of one Medium into another more gross, or more fine, do refract or turn aside" (I, 445). "Mathematicians . . . have by Observations found the Laws of Refraction of all oblique Rays, and that in every Medium there is a constant fixed Proportion between the Sine of the Angle of Incidence and of the refracted Angle" (I, 446). One effect of refraction caused by the earth's atmosphere is to cause "the Sun and other Stars to appear before they come to the Horizon at rising, or after they are passed it, at setting; and appear higher than they really are, while they are under twenty Degrees of Elevation." (I, 448). Thus in high latitudes the length of the day and the period of twilight are sensibly lengthened. In the very highest latitudes the fundamental laws of refraction undergo some modification. The degree of refraction is in proportion to the density of the atmosphere, and by experiment it had been found that the "refractive Power exactly answered to the Proportion of the different Densities of the Air thro' which the Ray passed, so as to be twice or thrice as large when the Air had twice or thrice the Density" (I, 447). In the frigid zone, where the air becomes much colder and denser, the greater refraction lengthens the twilight period a great deal and allows the sun to be seen when it is in fact considerably below the horizon when rising and setting. In the far north where in winter there is no sun at all and in summer no night, atmospheric refraction has the effect of delaying the disappearance of the sun at the onset of winter and of hastening its reappearance at the approach of spring. On occasion these consequences of refraction could be quite remarkable, and Varenius several times refers to the extraordinary observations of a party of Dutch voyagers who had been forced to pass the winter of 1596-7 in Nova Zembla (Novaya Zemlya). "When the Dutch wintered in Nova Zembla , the Sun appeared to them sixteen Days before it came to the Horizon, that is, when under the Horizon four Degrees, and that in a clear Sky" (I, 448). When the Dutchmen later reported their experiences the unusual amount of refraction necessary for so early a sighting of the sun stimulated much scientific speculation and some initial incredulity (as being opposed to nature and to the known laws of refraction) and references to the observations of the Dutch voyagers in Nova Zembla may be found in scientific publications and in the transactions of learned societies from the seventeenth century onwards. It is very probable, in my view, that an early reading of Varenius, whose work was a text book of long standing at both Cambridge and Oxford, lies behind Coleridge's allusion to the 16+16 = 32 extra days of light made available to the Greenlanders by the secondary laws of refraction. Coleridge refers in his marginal note to Greenland and not to Nova Zembla (a lapse of memory perhaps) and in other respects his recollection of the observations of the Dutchmen was imperfect. His equation "16+16 = 32 days of Light" was obtained by assuming that sixteen extra days were also gained at the beginning of winter when in November the sun made its last appearance above the horizon, as well as at the end of the long winter night in February. Varenius says merely that "the sun left them the second of November , which by Refraction . . . should not have been so soon" (II, 618). Coleridge seems also to have been under the impression that the early reappearance of the sun by as much as sixteen days was a permanent, providential feature of the climate in such latitudes, whereas Varenius suggests that although the refraction so far north is considerable, the remarkable degree of refraction observed in the winter of 1596-7 was rare and was possibly due to some unusual and temporary condition of the atmosphere (I, 453, 461-4). Nevertheless, the experiences of the Dutch sailors form part of the background to Coleridge's note and I believe it is likely that it was Varenius's account of how the laws of refraction are modified in high latitudes that provided Coleridge with one of his illustrations ("among hundreds less obvious") of the way in which nature's "universal laws are suspended or tempered" by the "intervention of particular laws". Coleridge's statement in his marginal note that "Ice is the one exception to the General Law of Contraction by cold" recalls a notable scientific essay, "Of the propagation of heat in fluids", by Count Rumford (Sir Benjamin Thompson, 1753-1814), which appeared in two parts in 1797 and 1798. 18 Rumford's essay is of particular interest here, partly because it provided Coleridge (when writing his marginal note) with another pertinent example of a universal law modified in particular circumstances with beneficial effects, partly because the pronounced teleological character of Rumford's thinking in this essay affected Coleridge's own presentation of the argument from design throughout this important section of The Friend . In Chapters 1 and 2 of Part I of Essay VII Rumford gave a detailed account of the experiments he had conducted in order to demonstrate that water (with other fluids) was intrinsically a non-conductor of heat and that heat was propagated in it only by the motion of its individual particles. When this motion was inhibited by the addition of solid matter, such as feathers or fur, the propagation of heat in it was much reduced. The more viscous a fluid is, the less is its ability to propagate heat. When water is condensed to a solid form as ice, it is a very poor conductor indeed. "The discovery of this fact opens to our view one of the most interesting scenes in the economy of Nature," Rumford writes, since "the manner in which Heat is propagated in liquids . . . must act a most important part in the preservation of Heat, and consequently of animal and vegetable life, in cold climates" (II, 280, 231). "As liquid water is the vehicle of Heat and nourishment, and consequently of life , in every living thing; and as water, left to itself, freezes with a degree of cold much less than that which frequently prevails in cold climates, it is agreeable to the ideas we have of the wisdom of the Creator of the world, to expect that effectual measures would be taken to preserve a sufficient quantity of that liquid in its fluid state, to maintain life during the cold season: and this we find has actually been done" (II, 226). Trees in the far north, for example, are found to have sap that is thick and viscous and which consequently gives off its heat very slowly and freezes with difficulty. "Is there not the strongest reason to think, that this was so contrived for the express purpose of preventing their being deprived of all their Heat, and killed by the cold during winter?" (II, 228). The most remarkable properties of water are discussed in Chapter 3. "Though it is one of the most general laws of nature with which we are acquainted, that all bodies, solids as well as fluids, are condensed by cold: yet, in regard to water , there appears to be a very remarkable exception to this law" (II, 252). In temperatures above blood-heat the expansion of water is very considerable, but "in the neighbourhood of the freezing point it is almost nothing. And what is still more remarkable,—as it is an exception to one of the most general laws of Nature with which we are acquainted,—when, in cooling, it comes within eight or nine degrees of Fahrenheit's scale of the freezing point, instead of going on to be farther condensed as it loses more of its Heat, it actually expands , as it grows colder, and continues to expand more and more, as it is more cooled" (II, 283). When water becomes ice, "it expands even still more, and the ice floats on the surface of the uncongealed part of the Fluid " (II, 290). The consequences of this exception to "one of the most general Laws of Nature" offer to Rumford "a striking Proof of CONTRIVANCE in the Arrangement of the Universe", for the exceptional behaviour of water affects the whole economy of nature in a variety of ways and serves to make the globe habitable (II, 281). Were it not for the fact that water cools less and less rapidly as it nears freezing point and that a covering of ice still further inhibits the loss of heat, "the greatest part of the Heat accumulated during the summer in the earth on which the water reposes would be carried off and lost, before the water began to freeze; and when ice was once formed, its thickness would increase with great rapidity, and would continue increasing during the whole winter; and it seems very probable that, in climates which are now temperate, the water in the large lakes would be frozen to such a depth in the course of a severe winter that the Heat of the ensuing summer would not be sufficient to thaw them; and should this once happen, the following winter could hardly fail to change the whole mass of its waters to one solid body of ice, which never more could recover its liquid form, but must remain immovable till the end of time" (II, 299-300). "Let us see what must have happened if things had been left to what might be called their natural course ;—if the condensation of water on being deprived of its Heat had followed the law which we find obtains in other fluids . . . Had not Providence interfered on this occasion in a manner which may well be considered as miraculous , — all the fresh water within the polar circle must inevitably have been frozen to a very great depth in one winter, and every plant and tree destroyed; and it is more than probable, that the regions of eternal frost would have spread on every side from the poles, and, advancing towards the equator, would have extended its dreary and solitary reign over a great part of what are now the most fertile and most inhabited climates of the world!" (II, 288). Again, all life depends on those seasonal changes in temperature which are produced "in a manner at the same time the most simple and the most stupendous (by the inclination of the axis of the earth to the plane of the ecliptic); yet this mechanical contrivance alone would not have been sufficient . . . to produce that gradual change of temperature in the various climates which we find to exist, and which doubtless is indispensably necessary to the preservation of animal and vegetable life" (II, 285-6). In high latitudes particularly, "in order to render those regions habitable, some contrivance was necessary to prevent the consequences which [the] great inequality of the Heat generated by the sun in summer and in winter would naturally tend to produce" (II, 286). The exceptional characteristics of salt water, "the vast extent of the ocean, and its great depth,—but still more its numerous currents, and the power of water to absorb a vast quantity of Heat, render it peculiarly well adapted to serve as an equalizer of Heat", moderating extremes of temperature in all parts of the globe. The oceans give off the heat they have acquired, warming the cold polar air as it flows away from the poles, yet the falling rate of heat loss near freezing point, and the lower freezing point of salt water, prevent the oceans from totally losing their heat as well as inhibiting the excessive formation of ice (II, 287). When Rumford contemplated the diverse consequences for the economy of nature in thus making water an exception to one of the most universal of natural laws, he was overtaken by feelings of astonishment and gratitude. In a passage that is particularly relevant to Coleridge's argument in The Friend , Rumford remarks: "It does not appear to me that there is any thing which human sagacity can fathom, within the wide-extended bounds of the visible creation, which affords a more striking, or more palpable proof of the wisdom of the Creator, and of the special care he has taken in the general arrangement of the universe to preserve animal life, than this wonderful contrivance:—for though the extensiveness and immutability of the general laws of Nature impress our minds with awe and reverence for the Creator of the universe, yet, exceptions to those laws , or particular modifications of them, from which we are able to trace effects evidently salutary , or advantageous to ourselves and our fellow-creatures, afford still more striking proofs of contrivance , and ought certainly to awaken in us the most lively sentiments of admiration, love, and gratitude" (II, 282-3). Coleridge's own presentation of the argument from design in this section of The Friend owes something to Rumford's Essay VII, as both his text and his marginal note seem to indicate, but the argument in The Friend is extended to become an integral part of a more complex and ambitious argument of a very Coleridgian kind. "If we then behold this economy everywhere in the irrational creation, shall we not hold it probable that by some analogous intervention, a similar temperament will have been effected for the rational and moral ? Are we not entitled to expect some appropriate agency in behalf of the presiding, and alone progressive creature? To presume some especial provision for the permanent interest of the creature destined to move and grow towards that divine Humanity which we have learnt to contemplate as the final cause of all creation. . . ." 19 Just as in the economy of nature certain universal laws are suspended or tempered by the beneficial intervention of particular laws, so too in man's nature we may find a fundamental law, "the untempered and uncounteracted action" of which would prevent his development and progression, and this law we discover "in that law of his understanding and fancy, by which he is impelled to abstract the changes and outward relations of matter and to arrange them under the form of causes and effects. And this was necessary, as being the condition under which alone experience and intellectual growth are possible." 20 This law of his understanding, left "untempered and uncounteracted", inevitably tempts man to the superstitious worship of his own abstractions, to a blind materialism and slavery to his senses, and to a fragmentation of the "one divine and invisible life of nature". But by the intervention and "appropriate agency" of miracles and prophecies and by listening to the voices of inspiration, men can be "compelled, by a more impressive experience, to seek in the invisible life alone for the true cause and invisible Nexus of the things that are seen". 21 So the development of knowledge and spiritual insight in man is made possible by an "intervention" in, or exception to, a fundamental law of his nature analogous to that providential exception to universal law discovered by Rumford in his researches into the laws of the propagation of heat in water and other fluids, and analogous, too, to that modification of the primary laws of refraction observable in the lands of the far north, thanks to which life is made more tolerable there. 22 By invoking exceptions to the otherwise universal laws of nature as additional evidence for contrivance and design in the universe, Rumford gives a sophistication to the argument from design that is lacking in Paley's Natural Theology (1802), where Paley's treatment of natural law, and consequently of miracles, is particularly unsuitable to the needs of Coleridge's argument in this part of The Friend . I do not know when or by what means Coleridge became acquainted with the contents of Rumford's Essay VII, but Rumford's essays and articles were frequently reviewed, abstracted or reprinted in William Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts (of which Coleridge was a reader), and Volume II (containing Essay VII) of Essays, political, economical, and philosophical (1798) was reviewed in The Critical Review 30 (1800), 143-153. Having praised so highly the first volume of Rumford's Essays in 1796, it is not unlikely that Coleridge looked out for or noticed the appearance of the second volume in 1798 (containing Essay VII) or noted the earlier separate publication of the essay in 1797 and 1798. A notebook entry, which is itself relevant to Coleridge's marginal note to The Friend (1818), suggests that he was thinking about Rumford's views on heat round about March 1804: The Poles of Ice render the Torrid Zone Habitable &amp; the very much later accumulation &amp; Extent of Ice at the South Pole necessary to preserve the Ice at the North/?—How? The non-conducting Power of Fluids—else all ice/the high conducting power of the air/else all Scorch &amp; Conflagration/— 23 This is one of the rare occasions on which Miss Coburn does not provide a reference, but Rumford's Essay VII clearly forms part of the intellectual background to Coleridge's allusions here to ice and fluids. The notebook entry does not suggest a recent or close reading of Rumford's essay for Rumford clearly says in Essay VII that air is a poor, not an efficient conductor of heat.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Corrections Lists for F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise by James L. W. West III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">F. Scott Fitzgerald liked to make lists, "hundreds of lists: of cavalry leaders and football players and cities, and popular tunes and pitchers, and happy times, and hobbies and houses lived in and how many suits since I left the army and how many pairs of shoes . . . ." 1 And there are the famous lists in his writings: the list of New England schools in This Side of Paradise , the list of homosexuals in a rejected manuscript fragment of Tender is the Night , the guest list in The Great Gatsby . 2 This article, however, will deal with a different kind of list, a list (or in this case several lists) of changes that Fitzgerald wanted made in the plates of his first novel, This Side of Paradise . These lists, which Fitzgerald sent to Scribners during the spring and summer months after the March 1920 publication of This Side of Paradise , were recently found in the Scribner Archive at Princeton University Library. They supply new bibliographical evidence about the printing history of This Side of Paradise and establish Fitzgerald's attitude toward the faulty text of that book. For the student of textual problems, they also demonstrate that once a flawed text is in print, it is difficult for an author or his publisher to repair it. This Side of Paradise has a sloppy text. There are worse texts: prepublication cutting and tampering marred Look Homeward, Angel and Absalom, Absalom ! and post-publication corruption damaged The Great Gatsby and The Wild Palms , but in the category of careless error This Side of Paradise is probably unequalled. Fitzgerald was a notoriously bad speller, and his grammar and punctuation were idiosyncratic to say the least. Examination of the manuscript of This Side of Paradise (among the Fitzgerald Papers at Princeton) reveals that many of the errors in the printed version of the novel were carried over intact from the manuscript. But a collation of this manuscript with the first printing of This Side of Paradise has also brought to light numerous additional mistakes that are almost surely attributable to typist and compositorial error or to careless copy-editing and proofing. Not all of the errors in the printed version, then, are Fitzgerald's. 3 The mistake-riddled first printing of This Side of Paradise was published on 26 March 1920, and Fitzgerald was not long in hearing about the condition of his text. On 1 April 1920 Robert Bridges, editor of Scribner's Magazine , typed up the following office memo which listed eleven blunders: THURSDAYm, APRIL 1st, 1920. ERRORS IN: "THIS SIDE OF PARADISE" . by F. SCOTT FITZGERALD Page 28 : Line 10: "Ex-Ambassador" should be "Ex-Minister." Page 80: Line 7 from bottom: "Cambell" Hall should be "Campbell" Hall Page 128 : Line 13: "Dachari" should be "Daiquiri" Page 226 : Line 2 from bottom: "Benêt" should be "Benét" Page 228 : "I restless" should be "I am restless" (?) Page 229 : "Kerenski" should be "Kerensky" Page 229 : "Gunmeyer" should be "Guynemer" Page 232 , "Gouveneer" should be Gouverneur". Page 294: "Mackeys" should be "Mackays". Page 304 , Line 19: "God's" should be "Gods" (plural I also think the Dedication is wrong and that "Sigorney" should be spelled "Sigourney"; but I can't prove it. Robert Bridges. 4 Fitzgerald, in New York in early April to marry Zelda Sayre, followed Bridges' list with a list of his own. On the backs of sheets of stationery from the Biltmore Hotel — Fitzgerald and his bride were honeymooning there — he wrote down 29 changes that he wanted made in the plates. Of these alterations, 19 corrected errors in spelling, punctuation, and word usage, and the other ten were stylistic. This is not the conventional accidental-substantive distinction; there are mixtures of accidentals and substantives in both categories: Corrections for This Side of Paradise On Dedication page Substitute Sigourney for Sigorney On page 6, line 7. change raconteur to the fem. gender On page 17 Should be two quotation marks in front of Casey Jones. On page 18, line 26. change Rhinehart to Rineheart On page 3, (1st sentence in the book), put a comma after trait and one after few . On page 51, line 9. Change Litt . to Lit . On page 51, line 29, Change Cumizza to Cunizza On page 56, line 2 Change Litt . to Lit . On page 80, line 29 Change Cambell to Campbell or whatever correct spelling is. Page 116, line 6. Substitute metier for flare Page 117, Line 30 Substitute Lit. for Litt. Page 119, line 4 One dot is outside the parenthesis Page 180, line 24 Substitute shimmee entheusiasticly . for tickle-toe on the soft carpet Page 182, line 27 Substitute the word utterly for the word just P. 184, line 1 Should be unimpeachable instead of impeachable P 199, 4th line from bottom Change juvenalia to juvenilia Page 224, line 24 Change Jenny to Jennie Page 224, line 25 Change Mckenzie to Mackenzie P. 228, line 23 Change I restless to I am restless P 229, line 17 Gunmeyer is not the correct Spelling of this name. Page 234, line 8 juvenilia instead of juvenalia Page 235, line 14 delete comma after sight P 235, line 23 should read was dead and sound not yet awoken—Life cracked like ice!—one brilliant ect (In other words, the word life should be capitalized but not the word one ) P 240 Are the genders right in fifth line of poem? P 251, Line 9 Stretch ! should be Scratch ! P 296, line 27 deep should be much 5 Scribners now had one list from Bridges and one from Fitzgerald. Maxwell Perkins, Fitzgerald's editor, apparently directed the printers at the Scribner Press to make the changes in these lists, for on 8 July 1920 he wrote to Fitzgerald that the corrections were made "in the earliest edition [ i.e. , printing] we could catch." 6 This was the fourth printing of May 1920. However, not all of the changes that Fitzgerald had asked for were made. No alteration was made in the French poem on page 240 (Fitzgerald would dictate a specific spelling change in a later list), and the spelling error "juvenalia" for "juvenilia" was left standing on both pages mentioned by Fitzgerald. So matters stood through May and June and two more printings of This Side of Paradise . By now the book was attracting notice and selling well. Word of its success spread to England, and W. Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd. of London agreed to bring out an edition for the English market. News of the planned fresh typesetting reached Fitzgerald in Westport, Connecticut, where he and his wife were living for the summer, and caused him to write the following letter to Perkins: Westport, Conn. July 7th 1920 Dear Mr. Perkins: In regard to this English edition of Paradise I want to ask you a favor. It seems to me that if the book appears there in a land of much more intense scholarship with approximately 100 mispellings and misprints it would hurt it. You already have at least two lists of corrections Mr Bridges + mine + I am putting down herewith another list of additional ones some Harvard scholar sent me. I have gotten several letters recently which indicate that it is rather a mistake to let the book go thru edition after edition without corrections. Of course almost all the mistakes were mine but it was rather humiliating this morning to get a letter wondering whether "they left the mistakes in just as they did in the Young Visitors to keep the spirit of the original." 7 At the end of this letter, Fitzgerald put down his second list of corrections, some of which had already been made in the plates and others of which were new: Corrections (3 d list) 8 [page] 4 Change Margaritta to Margherita " 7 " Ashville to Asheville " 120 " Dachari to Daiquiori " 154 " Cecelia to Cecilia " 176 " Johnston to Johnson " 229 " Gunmyer to Guynemer " 232 " Gouveneer to Gouveneur " 233 " Bennet to Bennett " 240 " langeur to langueur " 242 " Celleni to Cellini " 252 " tens to teens " 300 " bon to borne If you can't find the other two lists I may be able to get another thorough list from some one. F.S.F. 9 All of the new errors mentioned in this second Fitzgerald list were changed in the Scribners plates. The new readings appeared in the seventh impression of August 1920. On 8 July 1920, Perkins wrote a letter to Fitzgerald telling him what was being done about the upcoming English edition: As for the English edition, as they will set the book up, most of these corrections should be made by their proofreaders, — that is, unless proofreading in England has sunk to the level to which the war has somehow brought it here. We have virtually had to undertake to read typographically in the Editorial Department now, and that is a very different thing from the ordinary editorial reading which is done by way of making suggestions and criticism. It is purely the mechanical and therefore irksome. But to make sure that the English catch the mistakes, I will get together the lists you have sent and the one we have made and send a complete list to their editorial department. 10 Perkins had on hand one list from Bridges and two from Fitzgerald, and he apparently conflated the three and sent the resulting list to Collins in London. This conflated list is not in the Scribner Archive at Princeton, but judging from the English publisher's reply to Scribners, one error was again not mentioned: 28th July 1920. Messrs Charles Scribner's Sons., Fifth Avenue at 48th Street, NEW YORK. Gentlemen, We are very much obliged to you for the corrections that you have sent us for "THIS SIDE OF PARADISE". We will read the book very carefully for press in any case and will see that these are incorporated. We notice one mistake which you have not given in your list which is, that the author repeatedly uses the word juven a lia instead of juven i lia. 11 On this side of the Atlantic, new criticism of the text of This Side of Paradise was appearing. Franklin P. Adams in his New York Tribune column "The Conning Tower" for 6 July 1920 attacked Fitzgerald for writing a book that was "sloppy and cocky; impudent instead of confident; and verbose. It is doubtful whether the Scribner proofreading is at fault for the numerous errors; and if they are the author's, they indicate a sloppy carelessness that it will pay Mr. Fitzgerald to overcome." Adams followed his remarks with a list of errors which he evidently got from a first, second, or third printing of This Side of Paradise , since some of them had by that time been changed in subsequent printings: He speaks, for example, of "Frank on the Mississippi." The book is "Frank on the Lower Mississippi," as any slippered pantaloon who used to read Harry Castlemon will recall. Other instances of Mr. Fitzgerald's disregard for accuracy follow: Ashville [Compton] McKenzie Collar and Daniel's "First-Year Latin" Fanny Hurst Mary Roberts Rhinehart Lorelie cut a swathe "Ghunga Dhin" [Swinburne's] "Poems and Ballades" flambuoyant "Jenny Gerhardt" "Come Into the Garden, Maude" flare [for flair ] [Arnold] Bennet Gouveneer Morris 12 Fitzgerald was undoubtedly troubled by these fresh evidences of error in his book. His response was another letter to Perkins and another list of errors: Westport, Conn. July 16th, 1920 Dear Mr. Perkins: Last week in the Tribune F. P. A. balled out my book and gave a long list of mispellings — I find by looking at the sixth edition that many of those first list of corrections havn't been made — for instance juvenalia (twice) in the section called "Tom the Censor" in "Experiments in Convalescense." I really think it has been a mistake to let it go so long. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Sincerely F Scott Fitz F.P.A. finds the following new misspellings Frank on the Mississippi should be Frank on the Lower Mississippi Chap I Collar + Daniel's First-Year Latin (mispelt) Chap I Cut a swathe (mispelt) Chap II Poems + Ballades should be Poems + Ballads (Chap II) Fanny Hurst should be Fannie Hurst Lorelie (mispelt) Ghunga Dhin (mispelt) Flambuoyant (mispelt) Come Into the Garden, Maude. (mispelt?) 13 But F.P.A. was not through with This Side of Paradise . In his 14 July 1920 column he published a second collection of errors from the book — this list supplied him by someone with the initials "C. W." inexplicably (for inextricably) Christie Mathewson Mont Martre confectionary tetotalling Lyoff Tolstoi Samuel Johnston Juvenalia Celleni forborne stimulous born (for borne) Fitzgerald, still anxious to patch up his novel, sent a postcard to Perkins three days later giving his fourth and last list of errors: Westport, Conn. July 17th 1920 F.P.A. is at it again.

His letter indicates that he, too, wanted to mend the text of This Side of Paradise : I was disappointed to find you were right about the corrections you named not having been made in the sixth edition. I am sending you a list of the corrections that were made and I am sending a list of those that still should be made to our press for the next edition. 15 For his third and fourth lists, however, Fitzgerald had not given Perkins page or line references to the readings, and probably for this reason only one of the new errors from these last two lists was located: "Ghunga Dhin" at 18.22 was changed to "Gunga Dhin." Also, the correct reading "Rinehart" at 18.26 (which itself was a plate change over erroneous "Rhinehart" of the first three printings) was altered again between the sixth and seventh printings to read "Rineheart," the wrong spelling Fitzgerald had suggested in his first list. These two changes, like the ones from Fitzgerald's third list, appeared for the first time in the seventh printing of the book. That ended the work on the plates of This Side of Paradise ; the novel finished out its run and these plates were probably stored. When they were resurrected in 1947 for a new printing, only a little type batter had been added. Here we might pause and count up the number of corrections lists that seem to have been made. They are: (1) Robert Bridges' list of 1 April 1920; (2) Fitzgerald's first list, probably compiled in early April 1920; (3) the list "some Harvard scholar" sent to Fitzgerald; (4) Fitzgerald's second list, made for the English edition and included in a 7 July 1920 letter to Perkins; (5) Perkins' conflated list which he sent to Collins in London probably in early July 1920; (6) F.P.A.'s first list in his column for 6 July 1920; (7) Fitzgerald's third list, occasioned by F.P.A.'s first list — this list was sent to Perkins on 16 July 1920; (8) the list put together by "C. W." and published in F.P.A.'s column for 14 July 1920; (9) Fitzgerald's fourth list, occasioned by "C.W.'s" list—this list was sent to Perkins on 17 July 1920; (10) Perkins' "list of the corrections that were made" which he told Fitzgerald he was going to send to him; (11) Perkins' "list of those that still should be made" which he told Fitzgerald that he would send "to our press for the next edition." With so much effort going into the making of lists, one wonders what happened to the plates. The machine collation below tells the story. There are no unexplained changes; each plate variant is mentioned in at least one of the lists given above: 16 Page &amp; First Fourth Seventh Line Printing Printing Printing [v] SIGORNEY SIGOURNEY 3.1 trait trait, 3.2 few few, 4.1 Margaritta Margherita 6.7 raconteur raconteuse 7.33 Ashville Asheville 17.3 'Casey-Jones "Casey-Jones 18.22 "Ghunga Dhin," "Gunga Dhin," 18.26 Rhinehart Rinehart Rineheart 28.10 ex-ambassador ex-minister 51.9 Litt.

Some errors were corrected in one spot but left standing in another. For example, "Bennet" at 233.14 was altered to "Bennett" but a second "Bennet" referring to the same English novelist was left at 224.25. "Ashville" at 7.33 was corrected to "Asheville" but another "Ashville" five lines above at 7.28 was untouched. Other errors mentioned by Fitzgerald were not corrected: for instance, "flambuoyant" at 49.15 was left alone, and "Juvenalia" at 234.8 and 235.2 and "juvenalia" at 199.29 were never changed. And there are errors in the text of the first edition that were not noticed by any of the list-makers. See, for example, the readings at 139.21 and 233.8. 17 As late as 1922, at least one critic was still chiding Fitzgerald and Scribners about the errors in This Side of Paradise . In his first essay on Fitzgerald, Edmund Wilson wrote of the novel, "it is one of the most illiterate books of any merit ever published (a fault which the publisher's wretched proofreading apparently made no effort to correct). It is not only full of bogus ideas and faked literary references but it is full of English words misused with the most reckless abandon." 18 Fitzgerald was embarrassed by the text of This Side of Paradise . In the novel he had flaunted his familiarity with books, poems, critics, authors, and philosophers. He had attempted to balance his showiness with a good dose of irony, but the misspelled words, incorrect titles, and wrong names undercut his attitude more than he had intended. Indeed, these mistakes were the beginning of Fitzgerald's largely undeserved reputation for pseudo-intellectuality, a reputation that is still brought out and aired occasionally today. Fitzgerald remained aware of the errors in This Side of Paradise for the rest of his life. He once inscribed a copy of the novel: "This book is a history of mistakes — something never retracted yet, in a way, to be ashamed of, by a conscientious worker . . . Scott Fitzgerald." 19 In 1938 he tried to persuade Scribners to bring out a new impression of the novel, and having given up hope of getting the errors expunged from the plates, was toying with the idea of writing a "glossary of absurdities and inaccuracies" 20 for the printing. No new impression was issued, however, and no such glossary seems to survive. Fitzgerald's scheme to turn errors into assets apparently died with him in 1940. Today, there is still no reliable text of This Side of Paradise available. Scribners preserved most of the errors in the last printing of the first edition when they re-set the novel in 1960. In fact, the 1960 Scribners edition — distributed as a Scribner Library paperback and widely used by students, teachers, and even by publishing scholars — is worse than the 1920 text it is based on. A collation of the first printing of Scribners 1920 against the clothbound B-11.60[H] printing of Scribners 1960 reveals some 187 variants, a figure that does not include minor features of typography. Of the 187 changes, 40 enter the 1960 text legitimately from plate alterations in the first edition. Twenty-four of the remaining 147 variants are substantive, but only two of these substantive changes — at 127.26 and 270.22 of the 1960 text — can be classed as corrections. The other 22 changes are new corruptions. As might be expected, the 1960 text preserves " Juvenalia " at 218.25, "Juvenalia" at 219.17, and "juvenalia" at 186.20. The errors in This Side of Paradise are significant. They figure in the initial reception of the book and in its subsequent critical reputation. One might even say that the mistakes have become a part of the history of the novel. But as has been noted, not all of the errors in the book are Fitzgerald's. Blame for the mistakes has to be distributed all along the line of textual transmission. Fitzgerald deserves some of the blame, but as he wrote years later of the errors in This Side of Paradise : — "My God — did they expect me to spell? If I was such a hot shot couldn't the proof-readers do the spelling?" 21 The errors in This Side of Paradise should not be perpetuated. We are not getting the flavor of Fitzgerald's idiosyncratic spelling and word usage. We are instead getting a book marred by the careless error of most of the people — Fitzgerald included — who were involved in its original publication.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Samuel Edgerly: Printer in Calabar, 1846-1857 by R. H. Carnie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pros and cons of the impact of the missionary movement on the cultures of West Africa is still a matter of vigorous historical controversy. 1 One side-effect of the attempts to Christianise West Africa was the introduction of the art of printing by the missionaries in order to make the Gospel available to their converts. This short article attempts an objective account of the introduction of printing to that part of Africa now known as Eastern Nigeria, by the Presbyterian mission set up at Calabar in 1846. 2 It is, as far as I know, the first attempt by a booktrade historian to re-create the circumstances by which printing was brought to Eastern Nigeria. The data has been derived from both printed and manuscript records of the mission which are to be found in Scottish archives. 3 These relate to the missionary activities of the Presbyterian Church known from 1847 to 1900 as the United Presbyterian Church. This church had been formed in 1847 by the uniting of the Relief Church with the United Associate Synod of the Secession Church — two evangelical groups outside the Church of Scotland, particularly interested in missionary work. The United Presbyterian Church became part of the United Free Church in 1900. The United Free Church itself re-amalgamated with the Church of Scotland in 1929. The official Church of Scotland, therefore, is now the custodian of the records of the U. P. Church, 1847-1900. Presbyterian Christianity came to Eastern Nigeria via Jamaica. In 1834 the United Associate Synod resolved to send two missionaries to that island. By 1836 the Jamaican Missionary Presbytery was set up. Several congregations were established by the time of the union of 1847, a union which put all the Jamaican missions under the control of the U. P. Church, including the mission of the Scottish Missionary Society started in 1824. The missionary in charge at Mount Zion station, H. M. Waddell, 4 was one of those who strongly urged at a meeting of the Jamaica Presbytery in 1841 that a mission be sent to the homeland of so many of the Jamaican negros — West Africa — and Waddell returned to Scotland to propagate the idea in the home church. He was successful, and in May, 1844 the United Associate Synod agreed to send a mission to the long established trading post at Old Calabar, on the West African coast. Waddell toured Scotland and England raising funds (£4,000) for this new venture. In Waddell's group on this tour were Samuel Edgerley and his wife. Edgerley had been trained as a printer, probably in his home town, Shrewsbury, and had spent eighteen years in Jamaica. He had latterly been stationed at Mount Horeb as a catechist. The mission reached Calabar 10 April, 1846 and set up stations at Old Town, Duke Town and Creek Town in the Calabar area. Amongst their equipment was a lithographic press and a conventional press for letterpress printing. Waddell returned to Jamaica to recruit further missionaries and teachers, and, amongst others, the scholarly Scot, Hugh Goldie, joined the Calabar mission in 1847. Goldie's history Calabar and its Mission , (Edinburgh and London, 1890) is one of the most reliable sources of information about the infant press. Goldie says of Samuel Edgerley: 'Having acquired the art of printing, it was judged that this would make him of special service to the mission.' 5 Goldie also tells us that the lithographic press was under Waddell's care. Waddell had attempted to learn the lithographic art and his own account makes it clear that the first fruits of the Calabar Press were produced lithographically by him and not by Edgerley on his conventional press. A lithographic press was attached to the mission and the time had come to use it. The first use was to print off a series of 'Bible Lessons' in plain writing and very simple language, for the use of the 'gentlemen' of the country who had learned to read writings. It was a common fact that while not one could peruse a printed book, a certain number had learned to use the pen by way of trade. A series of twelve historical lessons was thus prepared and circulated. It was not without much trouble that the press was put into good working order, owing partly to the climate, and greatly doubtless to my inexperience in the art. 6 Various chiefs were presented with copies of the 'first book printed in their country' and Goldie records one comment in pidgin English: 'I see stone make book in one minute.' Waddell's published and unpublished writings also give us the fullest picture of Samuel Edgerley. After Edgerley died 28 May, 1857, Waddell wrote: Mr. Edgerley, a native of England, had gone to Jamaica as a printer, and afterwards entered the planting 'line' in which he advanced through the various stages of bookkeeper to be an overseer. The Mercy of God having arrested and converted him, he became a teacher in the Mico Charity, Montego Bay, and afterwards in connection with myself taught Mount Zion school first, and then got charge of Mount Horeb station. While he was there he was appointed by his own desire to be my assistant in Africa. Having known him, and been associated with him so long, and knowing so well his many valuable qualities, I could not but deeply feel his unexpected and premature demise. 7 Waddell had also recorded in 1855: The affairs of the Old Town claim our first attention this year, for they reached a crisis and ended in destruction. Mr. and Mrs. Edgerley taught the school there, and kept meetings on the Lord's Day in the town, and at other times in their own house, besides visiting several villages of the Qua people, the aborigines of that part of the country. . . . He was also much engaged in printing, and produced some of the best specimens of typography to be seen on the coast, whereby he greatly aided the cultivation of the native tongue of his brethren, and the progress of the schools. 8 Waddell's unpublished journal reveals, despite the tone of the above, that there was often trouble between him and Edgerley who complained directly to Waddell, and to the Mission Board of the home church, that Waddell was parsimonious and overbearing. Waddell clearly though that Edgerley was of a hasty and suspicious temper, and that he had acted very rashly on a number of occasions as far as the natives of Old Town, Calabar were concerned. On one occasion he was reprimanded for breaking an 'Egbo' drum venerated by the Efik people. 9 There is some evidence, too, that Edgerley, who had been left in charge in Calabar, when Waddell went on his staffing journey to Jamaica, resented the fact that newcomers to the mission had been placed in authority over him. Edgerley's complaints to the home board reveal his distaste for restraint and control, and his suggestion that he order his own supplies may indicate that he thought Waddell was hampering the printing operations. Edgerley returned to Scotland in 1850, ostensibly because of the health of his wife, and gave an account of the progress of the mission at Calabar. On this trip, he was ordained minister of the U. P. Church by the Glasgow Presbytery. The unpublished material reveals that Waddell was unhappy about this, believing that Edgerley was spiritually unprepared despite his piety and fervour. 10 When Edgerley returned to his duties at Old Town, his troubles continued, culminating in the withdrawal of the mission there and the bombardment of the town by a British Navy frigate, 'The Antelope.' Edgerley's vigorous reaction to discoveries of poisonings and charnelhouses in Old Town had made him unpopular with the Old Town people, and it is clear that Waddell thought him imprudent and partly responsible for the crisis and the destruction of the village. Waddell also puts on record his admiration for Mrs. Edgerley and her daughter, Mary 11 who were popular with the inhabitants of Old Town, Mrs. Edgerley being the first white woman to pass through Calabar streets. When attempts were made to rebuild Old Town, it was reported from Calabar to the home Board that the people in Old Town, who blamed Edgerley for the bombardment, would not permit him to return there and the question of sending him again to Britain was discussed. It was finally agreed that he should remain at Calabar, at the station at Duke Town, to give attention 'to putting the types in order and to the erection of a house.' The home Board concurred in the view that Edgerley's usefulness as a missionary was now doubtful but they were anxious that he should continue as the Printer to the mission and they agreed to his staying in Calabar to carry on the work of the press 'on the distinct promise that he was to abstain from all active teaching.' 12 Edgerley was still in Calabar, and engaged in printing a dictionary of the Efik language, when he died of fever 28 May, 1857. He was buried at the missionary station at Creek Town. The activities of Edgerley's press at first Old Town and then at Duke Town can be partially reconstructed from the letterbooks and minutes of the Board of Missions of the U .P. Church. Edgerley's earlier output is listed at the end of this article. In September, 1848, Waddell, who had collected a brief vocabulary of the Efik language, asked that 250 copies of it be printed in Scotland as the work could not be undertaken in Calabar. The Board agreed to have it printed by Grant and Taylor in Edinburgh, and in 1849 Goldie made inquiries about having a small catechism printed. By 1851, after Edgerley's return from Scotland, the Calabar press was once more in action. Andrew Somerville, the secretary to the home Board wrote to Edgerley, 12 Feb. 1852: Mr. Goldie mentions in a letter which I had from him, dated 26 November, that you are busy with the Press. This is a valuable agency. What would Luther have done without the art of printing? He might have done good in a few towns in Germany but he would not have reformed Europe, nor stamped his influence upon the world. When knowledge is committed to printing and when persons can read it, they have very easy access to it — can peruse it again and again, and impress it fully on the mind. I attach, therefore, much importance to the Press department at Calabar, and I am happy to hear that it is, in your hands, going on favourably. 13 Somerville reported in January, 1853 that he had received copies of the New Testament , and said, 'They are a credit to the Calabar Press.' In April 1853, Edgerley and Goldie requested from the home Board that a fount of brevier type, a specified number of accented vowel letters, twelve reams of good strong printing paper and certain other articles of printing paper be sent out. In July, 1853 the home Board acknowledged receipt of copies of Elijah and Jonah and the 1852 Annual Report , Mr. Waddell's History of Joseph , and the Calabar Hymn Book . 14 In October, 1853, Gibb, an Edinburgh printer who did work for the U. P. Church, was asked to fill further (unspecified) requests of Edgerley for paper and types, and in February, 1854, Somerville writes: 'You are usefully employed at the Printing Press. The books which you are sending out will be effective teachers and will very greatly aid in helping forward the reformation of Calabar.' 15 I have no record of further work done in 1854, in which year Edgerley visited Sierra Leone, and in 1855 the work of the press came to an abrupt stop with the expulsion of Edgerley from Old Town. He was at work again in Duke Town in 1856. Somerville writes, 18 July, 1856: 'I had a visit from Mr. Armour about rollers for printings. He is to send out a pair and some glair 16 — but he spoke of a kind of balls — used in printing in olden times — which he says climate does not affect and which he thinks will be suitable for you if you can make them. I asked him to find out from some old printer the way of making them and give you a description of the method.' 17 The inactivity of the press at the end of 1856 is indicated by a request by Waddell that his short course of lectures in Efik on the Ten Commandments be printed in Britain and by the fact that W. Anderson's Efik translation of the Epistle to the Romans was being printed in Glasgow in March, 1857. The Press was working well enough for Edgerley to have made some progress with the Efik Dictionary before his four-month illness and death, in May, 1857. An agreeable footnote to the short and stormy career of Samuel Edgerley, printer at Calabar, is the fact that he was succeeded both as printer and missionary by his son, Samuel Edgerley, junior. The boy had been brought to Britain in 1845. From 1852 to 1855, he had been apprenticed to an Edinburgh printer, J. Armour, 54 South Bridge. Armour reported in Dec. 1855 that the boy was ready to assist as a printer at the Mission. It was also suggested that he spend a few months learning bookbinding, which he did at the shop of Alexander Banks of Edinburgh, and that he attend normal school for six months to equip himself as a teacher. Banks reported that Samuel had been a good pupil, and could now do 'plain school-binding.' He sailed to Nigeria in May, 1856 to join with his father in running the printing-house at a salary of £60 per year. According to the Edinburgh Almanack for 1857 the Old Calabar mission now had an additional station at Ikunetu and that the two printers, the Rev. S. Edgerley and S. Edgerley were stationed there. In 1858, Samuel Edgerley, Jnr. was officially appointed printer, presumably at his father's salary of £120 per year, and a year later he was building a new printing-office. He trained in Scotland for the ministry from 1861 to 1863, and was in receipt of a special grant to keep his printing skills alive. After being ordained by the Presbytery of Edinburgh, he returned to Calabar, where, in a long and honourable career, he ran the Mission Press until his death in 1883. 18 LIST OF PUBLICATIONS OF THE CALABAR MISSION PRESS, 1846-1857. 1.
