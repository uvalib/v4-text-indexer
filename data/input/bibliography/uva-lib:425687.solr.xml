      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of Jefferson's Unpublished Errata List for Abbé Morellet's Translation of the Notes on Virginia by Joseph M. Carrière</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WRITTEN ORIGINALLY WITH NO VIEW to publication, but merely in answer to "a paper containing sundry inquiries" received in 1781 from M. de Barbé-Marbois, secretary of the French Legation in Philadelphia, Thomas Jefferson's Notes on Virginia (1785) contained a frank exposition of his views in favor of the revision of the constitution of that state and the abolition of slavery. The author was fully aware that these views differed radically from those held by many of his American contemporaries and might provoke to no useful purpose bitter controversy, if freely advocated in print. 1 For this reason, the Notes , which were first printed in Paris during the latter part of 1784 and the first months of 1785, 2 came off the press in a limited edition of 200 copies bearing no author's name and intended strictly for private distribution. Jefferson took great care to write on the fly leaf of every copy presented to friends a note enjoining them not to communicate the book to anyone who could not be relied upon to protect it against publication. Yet it was not long before he made the painful discovery that, at the death of one of the recipients, a copy had fallen into the hands of the bookseller Barrois, who was now planning to publish "a surreptitious translation." "This," Jefferson wrote to C. W. F. Dumas on February 2, 1786, "has induced me to yield to a friendly proposition from the Abbé Morellet, to translate and publish them, submitting the sheets previously to my inspection. As a translation by so able a hand will lessen the faults of the original, instead of their being multiplied by a hireling translator, I shall add to it a map and such other advantages as may prevent the mortification of my seeing it in the injurious form threatened." 3 From a letter which Jefferson wrote to his friend Madison a few days later, we not only learn that Morellet had owned a copy of the Notes which had been presented to him by their author, but also that he had already translated "some passages for a particular purpose" before anything was known about Barrois's plan. 4 It was therefore natural that he should have agreed with the bookseller to prepare for him a translation of the entire book if he would refuse to publish the other version. As for Jefferson, he really had no choice but to accept such an arrangement, although he had never intended to have his work translated into French. He lived in an age when authors enjoyed no effective protection against unscrupulous printers. The fact that Jefferson had given Morellet a copy of the Notes shows that he held him in very high esteem. Morellet and Franklin were habitués of the Société d'Auteuil composed of men of letters who met at the home of Mme. Helvétius. 5 Jefferson probably met the Abbé through Franklin, who, as we know, introduced his American colleague to many prominent literary personages in the French capital. 6 Morellet enjoyed great prestige in intellectual circles. His sharp wit led Voltaire to make a pun on his name and call him "l'Abbé Mord-les," "Abbé Bites-Them." In 1785, he was elected to the French Academy, the highest honor to which a man of letters could aspire. Jefferson knew, of course, that he had not only published in 1766 a translation of Beccaria's famous treatise Dei Delitti e delle Pene , for which Voltaire had written an anonymous preface, but that he had also translated in 1774 John Gregory's highly popular book, A Father's Legacy to his Daughters , and revised a French version of William Robertson's History of Scotland published in Paris in 1764. 7 Since Jefferson was uninformed about the careless way in which the delicate art of translation was generally practised at that time and took it for granted that others set for themselves the same high standards which he always imposed upon himself, it is not surprising that he should have fallen into the error of believing Morellet eminently qualified to render the Notes on Virginia into French. One should like to follow the progress of the translation from the time it was begun for Barrois until it was completed. Unfortunately, we have little documentation on this subject. Our information has to be derived almost entirely from six letters dated only by days of the week and all of them from Morellet to Jefferson. 8 From these, we gather, however, a few details which are not without interest. On one occasion, Morellet sends Jefferson a few pages of his French text to find out from him whether he has understood well the trend of his thought. 9 At some other time, he returns pages which have been of help to him in correcting his translation. Although the context is vague, he is apparently referring to notes or comments which Jefferson had transmitted to him on specific details of translation. 10 In another letter, Morellet tries to justify the way he had rendered the phrase "a knowledge of the first order. 11 " On three different occasions, he comes back to the subject of the printing and engraving of the map of Virginia which both he and Jefferson considered an indispensable supplement to the book. 12 From remarks to be found in Morellet's letters, it seems clear that he did not first translate the entire book before transmitting his manuscript to the printer, but sent him from time to time a certain number of pages, which had been previously submitted to Jefferson for his examination. The translation of the Notes appeared with the following title page: Observations| sur | La Virginie, | Par M. J***. | Traduites de L'Anglois. | A Paris, | Chez Barrois, l'aîné, Libraire, rue du | Hurepoix, près le pont Saint-Michel. | 1786. It should be noted that the title-page did not bear the name of the translator, and carried only the initial of Jefferson's name. The book was published with a new map of Virginia prepared by the author. 13 Although the translation appeared with the imprint of 1786, and this date has been accepted as that of publication by bibliographers as well as students of Jefferson, actually it was not published until the following year. In a letter to the English bookseller, John Stockdale, dated February 1, 1787, and dealing with the publication of an edition of the Notes in London, Jefferson wrote: "I never did intend to have made them public, because they are little interesting to the rest of the world, but as a translation of them is coming out, I have concluded to let the original appear also." 14 While we cannot determine the exact week or month Morellet's translation was actually published, we know that it came out during the first part of 1787, since the Mercure de France published a long review of it in its issues of June 2 and 9 of that year. 15 The book as it appeared in print, with the exception of the map, had little which could appeal to a man of such exacting taste and high literary standards as Jefferson. It was printed on paper of mediocre quality; the type was not attractive; there were numerous misprints and errors of translation, and the order of the material had been changed. In the Avertissement , Morellet explained the reason which had induced him to transpose parts of the text from the place where they occurred in the original to a different one in the translation. He wrote: "L'Ouvrage qu'on donne ici au Public a été imprimé en 1782 [ sic ], sous le titre de Notes on Virginia , &amp; n'est en effet qu'un recueil de Notes, ou Observations détachées, servant de réponse aux Questions d'un ami de l'Auteur, Européen qui cherchoit à connoitre cette partie des États-Unis; mais on ne craint pas d'annoncer que sous un titre si modeste, le Lecteur trouvera des connoissances approfondies &amp; des idées étendues. "L'Ouvrage n'ayant d'autre plan que celui qu'a donné l'ordre des Questions, qui n'est pas toujours le plus naturel qu'on pût suivre, le Traducteur a pris la liberté, avec l'agrément de l'Auteur, de transposer quelques morceaux." 16 Morellet's explanation contains factual errors which must have irked the author considerably. The Notes on Virginia were not published in 1782 as stated by the translator, but in 1785, even if the title-page of the Paris edition bore the imprint of 1782. Jefferson and Barbé-Marbois exchanged letters, but the relationship which existed between them was not such that they can be called friends. Moreover, if Jefferson ever agreed to the changes made in the order of the text of the Notes , it must have been most reluctantly and only under very great pressure since he later expressed unequivocal disapproval of the transpositions made by the translator. 17 Morellet lists the most important of these changes and adds that nothing has been omitted from the original. The seventh query of the original devoted to the study of the climate has become the second chapter of the translation. 18 The ninth and tenth queries of the English text dealing with military forces on land 19 and sea 20 have been placed towards the end of the book after the last paragraph of the part concerning public income and expenses. The proposal for the emancipation of the Negroes, which, in the original, came under the heading "Plan for the revision of our constitution" 21 has been transferred to the section devoted to the slaves. 22 The observations communicated to Jefferson by his friend Charles Thomson after reading the manuscript no longer appear in an appendix at the end of the book, but are printed in the text after the passages to which they refer. They are set off from Jefferson's text by square brackets. Jefferson's notes have been removed from the bottom of the page and printed also in the text. The translator justifies this change by saying that Thomson's notes are comments on those of Jefferson, which seem to be related closely enough to the text to form a connected sequence with it. "This is," Morellet adds, "the way notes should always be, if by following this rule, one were not dispensed from writing any." However objectionable all these changes were to Jefferson, the presence of numerous misprints and errors in the translation was undoubtedly a still greater source of disappointment to him. As is well known to bibliographers, not one, but two errata lists entirely different in their contents were printed, the second as a cancellans after the sheets had been impressed. One of these lists is only nine lines long, while the other covers approximately two pages and a half. 23 Among its rich collections of Jeffersoniana, the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia possesses two copies of the French translation of the Notes ; one of these, in the Byrd collection, contains the short errata list, the other, in the McGregor collection, the long one. An interesting feature of the Byrd copy is that a large number of manuscript corrections in ink and in an eighteenth-century hand are to be found in its text. 24 None of the corrections in the short errata list appears among the notations in ink which are to be seen in this copy. An examination of these manuscript corrections and the long errata list shows, on the other hand, that all passages corrected in that list—and eleven others not to be found there—have also been corrected in the Byrd copy. Except in three cases, the French word or phrase written in ink in the text as a correction of an error of translation is the same as the one given at the corresponding place in the long errata list. On the basis of the information which we have used up to this point, if it were not for the bibliographical evidence of the cancellation made in the final gathering in order to substitute the longer form, one might conclude that the long errata list was printed first, the shorter one later to supplement it. 25 As for the notations in ink, we might argue that they were written into the Byrd copy by some contemporary who had access to the long list. The presence of corrections in ink not to be found in the long list might be explained as the result of a very careful examination of the original and the translation, although it would be difficult to explain why none of the errata indicated in the short list are corrected in the notations in ink. There exists, however, a little known document which throws a vivid light on the history of the errata lists and the manuscript notations in the Byrd copy, and which illuminates the bibliographical evidence. In the Jefferson Papers at the Library of Congress, is to be found a seven-page letter press copy of a memorandum written in Jefferson's hand, which is dated January 19, 1787, and entitled "Errors in the Abbé Morellet's translation of the Notes on Virginia the correction of which is indispensable. 26 " In this memorandum, the English passages containing typographical errors, or words or phrases the translation of which Jefferson questioned, and the corresponding passage of the French text are presented in parallel columns. The English word or phrase which he considered wrongly translated and its French equivalent are in many cases underlined. A comparison of the contents of this document with those of the two errata lists provides an interesting revelation. Whereas none of the six errata in the short list is to be found in the memorandum, every one of the forty-five in the long list is included among the seventy errors which Jefferson recorded. It is clear that his memorandum was prepared after the short errata list had been printed. It would be indeed difficult to explain how Jefferson would have failed to notice and write down any of the errata indicated in it, if his list had been intended to supplement it. The fact that the person who prepared the long errata list did not find anything to correct which is not also found in Jefferson's memorandum points to an interesting conclusion. Since a comparison of the original and the translation of the Notes shows many errors which Jefferson did not record, it seems impossible that the translator could have failed to discover at least a few misprints or evident errors of translation not listed in the memorandum, if he had made even a half-hearted attempt at preparing as accurate as possible an errata list. One is forced to conclude that whoever prepared the second errata list had at his disposal the original of Jefferson's memorandum and relied exclusively on it. The absence from that list of twenty-five corrections requested by the author in his memorandum does not invalidate that conclusion. In some instances, Morellet may have been convinced that his translation was correct. In others, he may have considered the error not important enough to warrant a correction, or he may have been unable to find an adequate substitute for what he had originally written. Moreover, he would naturally be inclined to shorten as much as possible a long list of errata which could only raise doubts as to the value of his translation. Finally, he may have failed to make all suggested corrections through sheer carelessness or indifference. In this connection, it should be pointed out that, when preparing the first errata list—the short one—he did not read proof much beyond page 99, since the last erratum which he recorded occurs on that page. 27 It can be taken for granted that, if it had not been for Jefferson, no other list would have ever appeared. One should not fail to add, however, that if Jefferson was most unfortunate in having Morellet as a translator, Morellet was equally unfortunate in choosing to translate the Notes on Virginia . It was not customary for authors to be in a position to exercise such close supervision over their translators. There is still another interesting problem connected with the long errata list. Of the fifty-six manuscript notations in the Byrd copy, all without a single exception are corrections requested by Jefferson in his memorandum, and, as already stated, only in three cases does the wording of these notations vary from that of the corresponding entry in the long errata list. It is again clear that the writer of these notations had access to Jefferson's list. Morellet's name comes at once to one's mind as the probable writer of the manuscript notations. Unfortunately, we have no means of tracing the history of the Byrd copy. Moreover, with the exception of three notations, the longest of which is three lines, the corrections written on the various pages all consist of three or four words at the most. Their briefness makes it impossible for one who is not an expert in handwriting to draw any valid conclusion from a comparison of the hand in which they are written and that of the Morellet letters in the Jefferson Papers. Yet, to me, they present a number of common characteristics. But whether the corrections in the Byrd copy were written by Morellet or someone else, there can be no doubt that whoever wrote them had access to Jefferson's list. Because of the interest of this list and its inaccessibility to the average student, it is printed here in full. Peculiarities of spelling and punctuation found in the letter press copy have been retained, with the exception, however, of Jefferson's spelling of the French preposition à as á , which has been changed. 28 Errors in the Abbé Morellet's translation of the Notes on Virginia the correction of which is indispensable pa. 2. 36°30' 2. 36°3' 29 145. in the same season of 1780, Chesapeak bay was solid from it's head to the mouth of Patowmac.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See letter of Jefferson to Chastellux written on June 7, 1785, in which he gives the French author permission to translate for the Journal de Physique sections of the Notes which might be of interest to the editors, but adds: "The strictures on slavery and on the constitution of Virginia are not of that kind, and they are parts which I do not want to have made public, at least till I know whether their publication would do most harm or good. It is possible that in my own country these strictures might produce an irritation which would indispose the people towards the two great objects I have in view, that is the emancipation of their slaves &amp; the settlement of their constitution on a firmer &amp; more permanent basis. If I learn from thence, that they will not produce that effect, I have printed &amp; reserved just copies enough to be able to give one to every young man at the College. It is to them I look, the rising generation, and not to the one in power, for these great reformations." The Writings of Thomas Jefferson , Ford edition (New York and London, 1904), III, 318-19. Will be referred to henceforth as Ford. Chastellux's plan to translate parts of the Notes was never put into execution. 2 For more information on this subject, see Alice H. Lerch, "Who was the Printer of Jefferson's Notes? " in Bookmen's Holiday. Notes and Studies Written and Gathered in Tribute to Harry Miller Lydenberg (New York, 1943), 44-56. 3 Ford, III, 324-25; see also Jefferson's letter to Dr. Edward Bancroft, February 26, 1786, ibid. , III, 325. 4 The text of this letter written on February 8 will be found in Ford, III, 322. 5 Morellet speaks at length of his relations with Franklin in his Mémoires sur le dix-huitième siècle et sur la révolution (Second edition, Paris, 1822), I, 295 ff . 6 See Gilbert Chinard, Les Amitiés américaines de Madame d'Houdetot d'après sa correspondance inédite avec Benjamin Franklin et Thomas Jefferson (Paris, 1924). 7 Morellet's Mémoires constitute an interesting record of his literary activities as well as a valuable source of information on French intellectual life during the eighteenth century. He was born in 1729 and died in 1819. Additional information on him will be found in Pierre Proteau's monograph, Etude sur Morellet considéré comme auxiliaire de l'école physiocratique et examen de ses principaux ouvrages économiques (Paris, 1910). 8 Jefferson Papers. Library of Congress. Volume 46, folios 7782-7792. A letter from Jefferson to Morellet dated July 2, 1787, and dealing with their difficulties with Barrois in connection with the map prepared for the book is printed in Ford, III, 332-35. 9 Folio 7783. 10 Folio 7782. 11 Folio 7785. 12 Folios 7782, 7787-7790. 13 This map was engraved by Neele of London and is also the one used in the 1787 edition of the Notes published by Stockdale. 14 Ford, III, 330. 15 Pages 29-40, 69-81. This is a highly enthusiastic review in which Jefferson's book is acclaimed as a notable contribution to science and philosophy. 16 The text of the Avertissement , found in the translation on pages i-v, is reproduced in French in Ford, III, 327-29. 17 See Ford, V, 367-68 for his comments in a letter written to William Carmichael on December 15, 1787. 18 Morellet, pp. 4-20; Jefferson, pp. 134-51. All references to the English text of the transpositions are to the 1785 edition of the Notes . 19 Morellet, pp. 339-42; Jefferson, pp. 162-65. 20 Morellet's chapter entitled "Marine militaire et Navigation," pp. 343-47, includes not only query x on the marine, found on page 165 of the original, but also the last part of query XXI on weights, measures, and money from page 317, line 25, to the end on page 322. 21 There is no such heading in Jefferson's text. The proposal for the emancipation of the slaves is outlined on pages 251, line 16, to 265, line 4, of "Query XIV. The administration of justice and the description of the laws?" 22 Morellet's chapter, "Esclaves noirs," pp. 198-217, comes from four different sections of the Notes . Pages 198, line 7, to 199, line 5; 199, line 6, to 212, line 11; 212, line 13, to 215, line 13; 215, line 14, to the end of the chapter correspond to pages 161, line 6, to 162 (end of query viii); 251, line 16, to 265, line 4; 298; line 8, to 301 (end of query xviii), and 130, line 27, to 133, line 4, of the original. The last section deals with the Albinoes. 23 Final gathering of the book is signed Bb and is a half-sheet octavo. The short form of the errata list occurs on signature Bb4 and was printed as an integral part of the book since it is physically conjugate with leaf Bb1. The longer form consists of a 2-leaf fold. Leaf Bb4, the original list, was cancelled, and to the stub of Bb1 was pasted this cancellans fold containing the longer form. The longer version, therefore, is a later addition, made after the original printing had been concluded and presumably after publication. 24 In addition to these corrections, there are in the Byrd copy six more manuscript notations in ink and in two different hand-writings. On the title page next to the letters M. J. someone wrote: "Jefferson," and under "Traduites de L'Anglois," the words "Par. M. l'abbé Morellet de L'Academie Françoise." In the translation, one finds in the same hand in the margin on page 21, " barre du Pec&lt;heur&gt; , the French equivalent of the place name Fishers-Bar in the text, and again in the margin on page 315 at the end of the chapter on religion: "La tolerance a été assur&lt;ée&gt; mais seule&lt;ment&gt; pour les sec&lt;tes&gt; chretiennes." Letters in pointed brackets were clipped off when the pages were trimmed by the binder. In a different and later hand, someone wrote the name "La Fontaine" on the title-page, and on the back of the false title the following bibliographical note: "Pour le nom de l'auteur et celui du traducteur, voir Dict. de Barbier, N o . 12996." 25 The opinion that the long form was printed first and the short one later was expressed by John C. Wyllie in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XXXV (1941), 71. Mr. Wyllie now acknowledges his error. 26 Jefferson Papers. Library of Congress. Volume 27, Folios 4717-4723. The date, written in a different ink, is crowded in at the top and is not certainly in Jefferson's hand. 27 In his memorandum, Jefferson lists three errors on page 103, one on page 104, two on page 106, one on page 113, etc. The fact that none of these appears in the short errata form should constitute ample evidence that checking was not carried much beyond page 99. 28 Jefferson's punctuation and spelling in the memorandum are much more informal than the spelling and punctuation found in his book and Morellet's translation. 29 Not changed either in manuscript notations in Byrd copy or in errata list. 30 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list to read "où sa largeur est de 5 1/5 milles entre les deux pointes avancées de terre." 31 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 32 Changed to paroît quelques fois in manuscript notations and to paroît quelquefois in errata list. 33 Changed in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 34 York-Town in Morellet's text. Indications on the letter press copy show that contact was not made between paper and press with the result that - Town was not reproduced. 35 Changed in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 36 The English text of this passage and its French translation were crossed out by Jefferson, who, on second thought, must have felt that the translation, although not literal, did not do violence to the original. 37 The English text and its French translation were crossed out by Jefferson. It is difficult to understand why he did so, unless he felt that lac , a misprint for bac , English ferry , would be obvious to the reader. 38 Au-dessus de was changed to au-dessus sur. Occurs at top of page 25. 39 Changed to au-dessous both in manuscript notations and errata list. 40 Changed to situées au-delà du Mississipi in manuscript notations and errata list. 41 Changed to de la branche nord du petit Kanhaway in manuscript notations and errata list. 42 The brackets were inserted in manuscript notations and errata list. 43 This passage was crossed out by Jefferson. 44 Changed to read à l'est in manuscript notations and errata list. 45 Changed to read &amp; parmi elles celle du Pic d'Otter in manuscript notations but not in errata list. 46 Changed in manuscript notations and errata list. 47 "La largeur de l'arche " changed to sa largeur in manuscript notations and errata list. 48 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 49 Sur crossed out in manuscript notations; left unchanged in errata list. 50 The English passage and its French translation were crossed out by Jefferson. 51 Changed in manuscript notations but not in errata list. 52 Changed to read aussi blanc qu'il soit possible d'en trouver à la surface de la terre in manuscript notations and in errata list. 53 Changed in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 54 Changed in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. The writer of the manuscript notations seems to have pondered considerably over the translation of these words. He first changed Source chaude and Source brulante to Source tiede and Source chaude , then wrote crossed out tiede and chaude . He began to write bouillante , but did not get farther than bou. Not changed in errata list. 55 Jefferson evidently wanted to write a environ , and not a d'environ , which is incorrect. 56 Changed to pouces in manuscript notations and in errata list. 57 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 58 Changed to territoire du lord Fairfax in manuscript notations and in errata list. 59 Wrote at the bottom of the page: "les vegetaux suivans qui se trouvent en Virginie y ont eté probablement apportés de climats situés plus au sud." This passage occurs in the English original, but had been overlooked by Morellet. Its translation is not to be found in the errata list. 60 In the manuscript notations the words "les dents ainsi configurées" are replaced by "de defenses ni la même structure"; in the errata list, the correction reads: "qui n'a point les dents ainsi configurées, lisez qui n'est point de la même structure, qui n'a point de défenses, &amp;c." 61 The negative ne was dropped both in the manuscript notations and in the errata list. 62 Changed to comme en convient M. de Buffon in manuscript notation and errata list. 63 The phrase "quoiqu'elles presentent encore des signes certains." was changed to "quoiqu'elles présentent aucuns signes certains" in manuscript notations, and to "quoiqu'elles ne présentent aucuns signes certains" in errata list. 64 Changed to on peut croire in manuscript notations and in errata list. 65 Changed to peut donc étre in manuscript notations and in errata list. Dont in Jefferson's memorandum should read donc . 66 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 67 Changed to read si cet animal étoit carnivore in manuscript corrections, but not in errata list. 68 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 69 The words the flat horned elk are translated as l'elan a bois palmé in manuscript notations; no correction in errata list. 70 Jefferson may have felt that Morellet's translation of this passage on page 126 of the French text was not close enough to the original. The French context reads: "C'est-là l'animal decrit par Catesby, comme le cervus major americanus , le stag , le cerf de l'Amérique , &amp; qui differe cependant du cerf autant que l'élan à bois palmé differe du daim." 71 Changed in manuscript notations to read quoiqu'aiant tant de caracteres de l'élan, de quoi le confondre . . ." Not changed in errata list. 72 Changed to de bonnes femelles in manuscript notations and to de bonnes nourrices in errata list. 73 Changed to si je puis croire avoir vu in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 74 Changed to boeufs in manuscript notations and errata list. 75 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. 76 qu'au contraire is blurred and illegible. 77 Changed to lorsqu'on en a pris soin en Europe in manuscript notations and in errata list. Jefferson forgot to copy the word soin . 78 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. 79 The bracket was added in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 80 The bracket was added in manuscript notations, but not in errata list. 81 In the manuscript notation has been changed to read: "Ces faits sont suffisans pour montrer que si les Américains aborigenes n'ont point des formes de gouvernement, ils connoissent la sociabilité politique . . .;" in errata list: "que si les Américains aborigènes n'ont point de gouvernement, ils connoissent une sorte de sociabilité politique . . ." 82 In the manuscript notations the text is changed to read: "En passant de Norwege en Islande, de l'Islande au Groenland, du Groenland au Labrador, le 1 er trajet est le plus long;" the errata reads: "après le mot Labrador; lisez le premier trajet est le plus long." 83 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. 84 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. 85 Corrections requested by Jefferson were made in errata list; in manuscript notations, the correction was made on the chart, but not on the page facing it. 86 The brackets were added in the manuscript notations, but not in the errata list. 87 Changed to de la même espece de blanc in manuscript notations and in errata list. 88 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 89 Changed in manuscript notation but not in errata list. 90 Changed to confreres in manuscript notations and in errata list. 91 Not changed in manuscript notation or in errata list. 92 Not changed in manuscript notations or in errata list. 93 Changed to deux fois pour les affaires civiles &amp; criminelles, &amp; deux fois pour les affaires criminelles seulement . This correction is found in the manuscript notations and the errata list. 94 A word coming before the passage is blurred and illegible. 95 Changed to loix &amp;c, dont il n'étoit pas en leur pouvoir ni dans celui de la couronne de s'écarter . The correction was made in the manuscript notations and in the errata list. 96 Changed to annullées in manuscript notations and in errata list. 97 Changed to l'arpenteur in manuscript notation and in errata list. 98 The correction was not made either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 99 Changed to du vendeur in manuscript notations and in errata list. 100 Changed to des plus anciens statuts existans in manuscript notations and in errata list. 101 Not changed either in manuscript notations or in errata list. 102 The "&amp;" is missing in the manuscript. 103 Jefferson forgot one of the "t's" in the French word littérature . 104 Changed to de l'Europe in manuscript notations and in errata list. 105 The word had is blurred and almost illegible. 106 The words aussi intolérans qu'en Europe envers leurs freres have been replaced by aussi intolérans que leurs freres in manuscript notations and in errata list. 107 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. 108 Changed in manuscript notations and in errata list. The last four words should read: " un acte de charité." Jefferson prefixed the wrong article to acte .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Correspondence with Thomas Jefferson Concerning the Public Printers Transcribed, with a Foreword, by Jessie Ryon Lucke</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DEARTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE early public printers of the United States has been commented on often enough; and, were it not for the pioneer listing of Greely, 1 the historian and the bibliographer alike would be lost in the morass of miscellaneous official and semi-official leaves and pamphlets which poured from the American presses during the first fourteen Congresses. Since the following heretofore unpublished letters shed considerable light on the printing practices of the first days of the Republic, they are transcribed in full. They have not been burdened with notes concerning the writers, since such information is readily available in standard reference works. 2 They comprise the earliest group of a collection of letters in the Executive and Foreign Affairs section of the National Archives, entitled "Laws of the United States and Related Papers 1789-1923," and are contained in a portfolio of letters to the Secretaries of State, concerning the printing of laws, 1789-1822. In addition to fourteen letters to Jefferson, eleven of which are from printers, presented here are a letter from the printing establishment of Childs and to Remsen, chief clerk at the State Department for two years under Jefferson, and a document, signed by Jefferson, to the Department of State, which confers his official approval on an edition of the "Laws of the United States of America," printed by Andrew Brown in Philadelphia, 1792. The remaining three letters to Jefferson recommend printers; one, from Jabez Bowen, recommends Bennett Wheeler; another, from William Bingham, recommends Andrew Brown; and the third, from David Sewall, recommends Benjamin Titcomb, Jr. One other unpublished Jefferson letter from the Library of Congress collection is printed in a footnote, because it supplements the correspondence with Benjamin Russell. This group is of special interest because of the information contained therein concerning printing prices current, and the indication, evinced by the letters of application and the letters "recommendatory," that much competition was called forth by the prestige accruing to those printers who were fortunate enough to obtain the coveted privilege of printing the federal laws. David Sewall's effort to get some political patronage for the State of Maine is also worthy of note.</field>

After a long printing Career, I shall reluctantly surrender to my said Competitor the Remains of a small Business, established with much Toil, Care and Expence; but should the Measure eventually take Place, your Excellency will be enabled to account for my Paper not arriving at your Office. With the highest Consideration for your Excellency's Character and literary Attainments, and zealous Attachment to the Government in which you hold so distinguished a Station, I have the Honour to be, very respectfully, your Excellency's obedient and devoted Servant, J o n Carter.

      <field name="fulltext">letter 8 Sir, Agreeably to the request contained in M r Remsen's letter of yesterday, I beg leave to inform you that should I be continued the publisher of the laws of the United States, 5 I shall perform that duty, with accuracy and expedition, at the rate of one dollar for what is equal to one page of the edition of the laws printed by Childs &amp; Swaine. This is considerably under what I have hitherto had from the State of Pennsylvania, and much less than my fixed price for advertising. I beg leave just to add that should the printer of any other reputable paper propose to undertake the business for a less sum I shall most cheerfully lower my price accordingly. I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient humble servant And. w Brown Philadelphia 26 Nov r 1790.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">letter 9 Boston , Dec. 5, 1790. Sir, In compliance with your request communicated by M r . Remsen, that I would furnish you with an estimate of the expense that will attend the publication of the laws of the United States in my paper; and the lowest price for which I will perform the work; I beg permission to inform your Honour, that the Laws of the second session inserted by your order amount to Three Hundred and Seventy-two * Squares of Long-Primer. These at half a dollar a square, amount to One Hundred and Eighty-six dollars. The price paid for publishing the Laws of this Commonwealth, in Long-Primer squares, has been reduced, on account of the competition of the Printers for the Printing work of government, which in some of its branches, is lucrative, from One Dollar to Half a Dollar—The price, therefore, that I have inserted, is regulated by the price given by this State—Your Honour's information will enable you to judge whether it is too high or not high enough. With me, Sir, compensation is &lt;not the&gt; first object, in the publication of the La&lt;ws&gt; of the United States; and while I earnestly solicit the continuation of your patronage; I shall rest satisfied, should I be so fortunate as to obtain it, with such allowance as you shall think just to make. I have empowered Captain Patrick Phelen, an officer of the customs of the United States, to receive, on my behalf, such sum as shall be allowed for my services.

      <field name="heading_text">In The Savoy: A Study in Post-Restoration Imprints by C. William Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHERS OF THE PERIOD OF THE English Restoration have for years associated the imprint phrase "In the Savoy" with presswork issuing from the King's Printing House. They have not, however, recognized the value of the phrase in identifying the printers of a large number of proclamations and books, especially plays, whose title-page imprints carry "In the Savoy" but fail to name the printer. Consequently they have not attempted what this note tries tentatively to do; that is, to set down the history of the phrase and to distinguish among the seventeenth and early eighteenth-century printers who used it. The Savoy was a large, sprawling structure situated in the Strand next to Somerset House and almost directly opposite the New Exchange. It was built originally in 1245 by Peter, Earl of Savoy, from whom it received its name. In the Restoration its ample apartments served as quarters for not only the King's Printing Press but also a prison; a parish church; religious assembly halls for the English dissenters, the French, Dutch, High Germans, and Lutherans; and a hospital harboring the poor. The Savoy fell into disuse and ruin late in the eighteenth century and was razed early in the nineteenth to clear the approach to Waterloo Bridge. The location in the Savoy of the King's Printing Office dates probably from the early weeks of September, 1666, when the great fire of London destroyed along with Baynard's Castle the neighboring shop of Thomas Newcombe, the printer of the London Gazette and the more active of the two printers working for the King under the patent held by the assigns of John Bill and Christopher Barker. The last extant issue of the Gazette which Newcombe signed with his Baynard Castle address is dated August 30, 1666; the issue of September 3, Number 84, is lacking in files of the news-sheet and was presumably destroyed by the fire. If we are to believe J. G. Muddiman, the next issue of the Gazette to appear, that of September 10, "Newcombe was compelled to print . . . in the open air, in the evil-smelling churchyard of the Savoy, choked with the bodies of the dead from the plague." 1 The imprint of this issue, however, reads simply "London, Printed by Tho. Newcomb." The exact date on which the King's Printing Office was moved to the Savoy, therefore, remains in doubt, but there can be no question about the fact that by November 8, 1666, Newcombe and the patentees of the King's Press had decided to make the Savoy their permanent quarters; for on that date Newcombe first used the imprint phrase "In the Savoy" on two different publications printed in his shop. One was the issue of the London Gazette dated November 8, 1666; the other was the King's proclamation "prohibiting the importation of all sorts of manufactures" printed "By the Assigns of John Bill and Christopher Barker" and likewise dated November 8, 1666. 2 From November 8, 1666, to July 19, 1688, the imprints on issues of the London Gazette run in an unbroken succession: "Printed by Tho. Newcomb in the Savoy." The forty-four entries in vol. 1 of Wing's S.T.C. bearing the imprint "In the Savoy by Thomas Newcombe . . ." are similarly distributed through the years from 1667 to 1688. No imprint containing "In the Savoy" is linked with any printer's name other than Newcombe's during those years, and no imprint bearing the name of Thomas Newcombe or the Assigns of Thomas Newcombe after 1688 contains the phrase "In the Savoy." The later Wing volumes will, of course, have to be checked in order to verify these findings, but in the light of the specific corroborative evidence furnished by the London Gazette imprints, there is little likelihood that any additional data uncovered will change the terminal dates of Newcombe's printing activity in the Savoy. Further, an examination of a substantial number of the publications bearing Savoy imprints without Newcombe's name printed between those terminal dates reveals the presence of ornaments and decorative capitals clearly identifiable as Newcombe's. Those books lacking ornaments present a typography in no way inconsistent with the assumption that Newcombe was the printer. Thus one may conclude with reasonable certainty that any proclamation or book with a Savoy imprint published between November 8, 1666, and July 19, 1688, came from the presses of Thomas Newcombe. That conclusion, however, needs one qualification. Sometime between December 21, 1681, and January 11, 1681/2, Thomas Newcombe, Sr., died, and his son, Thomas Newcombe, Jr., also free of the Stationers' Company and presumably working with his father, inherited the business and assumed his father's responsibilities. 3 Although the clerk of the Stationers' Company was making a distinction between father and son in Stationers' Register entries as early as October 27, 1677, no Newcombe imprint either in the London Gazette or in vol. 1 of Wing's S.T.C. makes the differentiation. Further, Thomas Newcombe, Sr., appears to have been actively engaged in his work almost to the end of his life, for his last entry in the Stationers' Register occurred on December 5, 1681. Therefore it seems safe to conclude, finally, that all material containing the imprint phrase "In the Savoy" printed between November 8, 1666, and December, 1681, was issued by Thomas Newcombe, Sr., and all material signed "In the Savoy" and printed between January, 1681/2 and July 19, 1688, came from the presses of Thomas Newcombe, Jr. Only a check of Wing's later volumes will determine whether the second Thomas Newcombe or any succeeding Savoy printer issued imprints carrying the phrase "In the Savoy" without his name. All eighty-seven imprint citations of this special sort gathered so far fall within the dates assigned exclusively to Thomas Newcombe, Sr. The imprint of the London Gazette for July 23, 1688, links the Savoy phrase for the first time with a printer named Edward Jones. The explanation for his replacing the younger Thomas Newcombe as the King's Printer midway during the year of the "Bloodless Revolution" is almost certainly political. Plomer states that Bill, Hills, and Newcombe were obliged to retire in favor of Jones "on the accession of William" because they had printed the declaration made by James 11 against the Prince of Orange. 4 Plomer's argument may be sound, but the date of the London Gazette first bearing Jones' name indicates clearly that Jones had taken over the duties of the King's Printer some months before William's Tor Bay landing on November 5, 1688. Whatever the political maneuvering was that led finally to Jones' gaining the patent as printer to the King, the fact is that from July 23, 1688, until February 18, 1705/6, two days after Jones' death, the imprints on issues of the London Gazette read without deviation: "Printed by Edw. Jones, in the Savoy." And thirty-two of the thirty-three entries in the first volume of Wing's S.T.C. containing the Savoy phrase dated from 1688 to 1700 are signed by Edward Jones. The single Wing entry (C6729) linking the phrase "In the Savoy" with another printer's name is Thomas Coxe's A Topographical, Ecclesiastical and Natural History of Great Britain . In the Savoy: by Eliz. Nutt: and sold by M. Nutt . . . and J. Morphew . . ., 1700. 4° O[xford: Bodleian]. Further investigation of this volume has revealed that Wing's imprint citation is accurate; the difficulty rests with the patently incorrect date "MDCC", which occurred as a result either of a typesetter's error or of someone's deliberate attempt at false dating. The text following this title-page in the Bodleian copy and in others similarly dated 5 is typographically in the same style as portions of the text of Thomas Coxe's Magna Britannia (6 vols.) printed in the Savoy by Eliz. Nutt some twenty years later in 1720-1731. Following Edward Jones' death, "M. Jones," apparently Jones' widow, undertook to manage the Queen's Press and to print the London Gazette . The news-sheet imprints indicate that her tenure of office extended from February 21, 1705/6, until February 26, 1707/8, after which Jacob Tonson, Jr., assumed the publication of the London Gazette at his Gray's Inn shop, and J. Nutt, who had served Edward Jones in 1700 and 1703 as the retail bookseller for two of Jones' publications, 6 began operating the Savoy presses. Thus one may conclude that all publications containing the imprint phrase "In the Savoy" printed between July 23, 1688, and February 18, 1705/6, were the presswork of Edward Jones, and all material bearing the Savoy phrase between February 23, 1705/6, and February 26, 1707/8, came from the presses of M. Jones. The evidence for determining the Savoy printers after 1708 is too sketchy to warrant any definite conclusions. The history reconstructed from scattered statements in Plomer's Dictionaries 7 reveals that the Office of Queen's or King's Printer passed successively from one member of the Nutt family to another. After J. Nutt's death in 1710(?), Benjamin Nutt seems to have held office in the Savoy. He was followed in 1720 by Elizabeth Nutt, whom Plomer conjectures to be J. Nutt's widow. Sometime in 1724 she, in turn, joined Richard Nutt in a partnership which lasted until 1738. Thereafter, until his death in 1780 when the King's Printing Office was moved from the Savoy to new quarters, Richard Nutt appears to have signed all imprints bearing the phrase "In the Savoy" with his name.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Three Shakespeare Piracies in the Eighteenth Century by Giles E. Dawson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DURING SOME PERIODS IN THE EIGHTEENTH century it is difficult to decide just what constituted a piracy. The established, prosperous members of the Trade, who owned the most valuable literary properties, such as Shakespeare and Milton, were loudly insisting that the copyright statute of 1709 had had no adverse effect upon their perpetual rights in these properties. This view was strongly contested by the small fry among publishers, who took the position that the Act had put an end to perpetual copyright and hence that these old authors lay in the public domain. Now and again one of the little men ventured to publish Shakespeare or Milton, was hotly denounced by the 'proprietor' as a pirate, and as hotly denied the charge. But this controversy arose only after 1731, for the Act of 1709 was perfectly explicit in continuing the copyrights of old books in the hands of their then possessors for the term of twenty-one years from 25 April 1710. Any play of Shakespeare's published during this period by any stationer other than the Tonson firm or the Wellington firm—the lawful proprietors of all of Shakespeare's plays—was undeniably a piracy. Three such piracies—the only ones known to me—form the subject of the present paper. But before we embark on the account of these three little spurious Shakespeares it will simplify matters to have before us a description of three other Shakespeares—irreproachable publications of the lawful owners of the copyrights, the Wellingtons: 1 (1) HAMLET , | Prince of Denmark; | A | TRAGEDY, | As it is now Acted by his | Majesty's Servants. | [ rule ] | Written by | William Shakespear. | [ rule ] | LONDON ; | Printed by J.

Tonson; and also for J. Darby, | A. Bettesworth, and F. Clay, in Trust | for Richard, James, and Bethel Wel-|lington. M.DCC.XXIX. 12mo. A-G 6 . Ford's bibliography 2 contains three entries corresponding to these. It ought to contain six, for there exist two editions of the 1723 Hamlet , two of the 1724 Othello , and two of the 1729 Macbeth to which the foregoing descriptions would in each case apply equally well. That Ford failed to recognize these duplicate editions is not to his discredit, for the duplication is so close that even when the pairs are seen together it is not easy at once to distinguish them. More conspicuous differences than those which they present have been overlooked in books of greater importance than these three insignificant duodecimos. Not until very recently was it recognized that the 1709 Rowe edition of Shakespeare and the 1765 Johnson edition were each two editions, actually, instead of one. And these pairs differ even as to collation. But their title-pages, their format, their illustrations—the points ordinarily observed by booksellers and collectors—differ only in such trifling details as no one but a prying bibliographer is likely to observe—or value. 3 This practice of making reprints duplicate their first editions might reasonably be taken to explain the reprints which we are now considering. A close examination of these, however, reveals certain features which clearly show such an explanation to be untenable and which suggest instead unlawful publication and an intent to deceive. It will make the detailed description of these features easier if we confine ourselves first to one of the plays—the 1724 Othello . In this description I use the letters A and B to designate the two editions (in what I believe to be their correct order). Title-page . Comparison of the A and B titles in the accompanying reproduction reveals small typographical variations sufficiently apparent without further comment. But it also reveals a degree of correspondence too great to be the result of accident or of the natural desire of the compositor of a reprint to save time and trouble by following his copy as exactly as possible. The dimensions of the A and B type-pages, for example, differ by scarcely a hair's breadth. 4 The similarity of the pair of ornaments on A and B , each composed of four common stock pieces, is not remarkable; the close correspondence of their relative positions is more so. Headband, A2 r . Again, it is not remarkable that the printer of B should have had in his shop, or have been able to obtain, the type sorts of which he found the A headband composed. These were standard ornaments, doubtless obtainable by any printer. The significant points are, on the one hand, that the two headbands are not exactly identical and, on the other, that they are so near alike that the differences can be detected only upon close examination. To make the rows of very small pieces which compose the outer border and separate the larger interior elements fill the required spaces, it was necessary to insert here and there thin types. In the top row are an exclamation point and a question mark; in the righthand side an exclamation point; in the lefthand side an 'i'. Exactly the same types appear in B as in A and in precisely the same positions—an effect which required careful calculation and counting. Factotum initial, A2 r . The factotum of B is not identical with that of A but is sufficiently like it—and this is the important point—to be regarded as unmistakably an imitation. The A factotum having been a woodblock, the B printer did not have, and could not go out and buy, a duplicate, as he could the component parts of the headband. His alternatives were instead to use another factotum of similar size and character, or to have an imitation of A specially made for the occasion. The first of these alternative courses would not, it seems, answer his purpose, and we may assume that he chose the second. It is chiefly upon this factotum (supported by the tailpiece on H6 v ) that my determination of the order in which the two editions were printed rests. It is obvious that the A factotum is old and worn, while B appears fresh and clean. Tailpiece, p. 96 ( H6 v ). Much of what I have said about the factotums applies to these tailpieces. B is of cruder workmanship than A , with heavy outlines and inferior draughtsmanship, but is clean and unworn. Signatures . One of the easiest quick tests by which to determine whether two given copies of a book (of the 18th century or earlier) are printed from the same setting of type or whether they belong instead to two different editions is to compare signatures. Since compositors did not bother to center their signatures exactly in the lower margins, a signature in one edition will ordinarily occupy a different position in relation to the letters of the line just above it from that of the corresponding signature in another edition. The variation between the position of the 'A2' in A and B (see the reproduction) is so slight as to appear not to be the result of chance. A comparison of the other signatures of the two editions makes it clear that chance is not here the controlling factor—that, even in such a trifling and unobtrusive detail, the B compositor was consciously imitating his copy, A . Of twenty-three signatures in the volume the B compositor placed eighteen of them more accurately than he did the 'A2'. Press figures . In many 18th-century books we find in an occasional lower margin a figure, asterisk, or the like—never more than one to a forme. These are believed to indicate the press or the pressman on which or by which the forme was printed. It seems probable that they were inserted by the pressman; they could not have been inserted until the formes were made up. And so there would normally be—and there normally is—no agreement whatever between the press figures of a first edition and those of a reprint of it. In the Othello there is such agreement. One press figure appears in A —a '2' on C6 v . And B agrees with this, even down to the position of the figure on the page. This can only be intentional imitation. So much for the 1724 Othello . The 1723 Hamlet and the 1729 Macbeth exhibit the same kinds of similarities in the two editions of each. Title-pages are copied with approximately the same degree of fidelity. Factotums and tailpieces of the two A editions are worn like those of Othello , while those of the B editions are new looking, heavy, rather crude in workmanship, and have the appearance of imitations executed by the same hand as those of Othello. Hamlet has at the head of its text a composite headband somewhat like that of Othello , the B edition showing the same care in the placing of the thin types needed to fill up that we found there. The Macbeth headpiece is, instead, a foliated woodblock ornament, B imitating A just as in the factotums and tailpieces. In its signatures Hamlet is almost as remarkable in the correspondence of B to A as Othello . Of a total of twenty-five signatures, eighteen agree more or less exactly in their relative positions. Likewise the Hamlet B press figures exactly duplicate the four in A —three stars and a '1'. In the 1729 Macbeth no press figures occur in either edition, and the B compositor failed to follow A in the placing of his signatures. From this mass of evidence it will be quite clear that in the printing of the three B editions neither trouble or expense was spared to produce careful type-facsimiles. There could have been no reason for this if the B editions were ordinary reprints (like those of 1709 and 1765) produced by John Darby, who is named in all the imprints. Had Darby been responsible for these reprints, supposing that he had had any motive for producing exact facsimiles, he could have made them better and with less trouble by using the same factotums and tailpieces instead of only moderately good imitations. He retained these old factotums and tailpieces in his shop and used them later in other plays. Quite obviously, then, the three reprints are the work of a pirate. And from the great lengths to which he went to make his spurious products look exactly like the genuine it seems probable that he had reason to fear detection. Were the evidence of piracy less conclusive than it is, one would be tempted to allow some weight to what appears at first sight to be a piece of contrary evidence, namely an advertisement appended to the 1729 Macbeth . In the 1723 Hamlet also, the original printer, following a common custom, filled what would otherwise have been a blank and wasted page at the end of the play by there placing an advertisement of 'Books printed for M. Poulson.' This our pirate, carrying out with complete fidelity the facsimile nature of his reprint, reproduces in its proper place (I6 v ), thus very honestly advertising the wares of his rival. In the Macbeth , Darby had a blank leaf at the end (G6), which he utilized by printing on the recto a list of 'Books printed for J. Tonson in the Strand' and on the verso one of 'Books sold by J. Darby in Bartholomew-Close, A. Bettes-worth in Pater-noster-Row, and F. Clay without Temple-bar, in trust for Richard, James, and Bethel Wellington.' Again, the pirate follows suit, reproducing the advertisements with close attention to details of typography, spelling, and punctuation. But there is a difference, and it is this that creates the difficulty. When we find, upon collating the Darby-Wellington list, that the reprint omits two titles, we need not attach much importance to the omission; it could, despite this printer's usual care, be a mere accident. But when, proceeding down the list, we find in the spurious reprint two titles not included in the genuine original, this is harder to explain. What we have seen of the pirate's work has not led us to expect from him any degree of carelessness that could have produced such a result. The only explanation which I have been able to evolve eliminates any carelessness on the pirate's part without, I hope, too great a strain upon our credulity. The two extra titles which appear in the reprint, ' Collier's Dictionary abridg'd, 2 Vol.' and ' Hartman's Family Physician,' were for many years among the Wellington stock. They appear, for example, together with most of the other titles in the Macbeth list, in a list of books printed for the three Wellingtons and sold by Darby, Bettes-worth, Clay, and R. Caldwell which is appended to a 1728 edition of Lee's Mithridates and in another Wellington-Bettes-worth-Clay list appended to a 1734 edition of Mithridates . Is it not reasonable to assume, then, that Darby omitted the Collier and Hartman titles from the Macbeth list by mistake, that he remedied this by a belated press correction, that copies were sold in both states, that the pirate had before him a copy with the list in the second state, and that the two copies known to me both belong, by an unhappy chance, to the first? Three questions about these elaborately executed piracies remain to be considered: Who was the pirate? When did he produce his spurious reprints? How did he intend to dispose of them? While I can supply no confident answer to any of these questions, I can at least throw some light on all of them and suggest some plausible answers. William Feales, who is first heard of in 1729, very soon established himself as a large dealer in plays. His name appears in the imprint of many plays between 1731 and 1736, never, so far as I have observed, as sole publisher, always in conjunction with such well-established capitalists as Bernard Lintott, the Wellingtons, or the Tonsons, particularly the last. From the first he appears to have been primarily a wholesale dealer in plays, especially remainders. Two receipts preserved in the British Museum 5 show him buying in October 1731 from Benjamin Motte 1950 copies of Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice for £13.11.0, and in July 1733 from Lintott 606 copies of Cibber's Love's Last Shift , the price not stated. Sir Courtly Nice was a fairly new play, published at some time in 1731, but the price of 1 2/3 pence per copy suggests a remainder stock. Though Feales sold plays separately, he also collected them into bound sets for which he supplied general title-pages. The first of these he called The English Theatre . This began as an eight-volume set, dated 1731, but additional 'Parts' of six or eight volumes extended the set by 1733 to twenty-six volumes containing 104 plays, which he advertised at £4.7.6 bound (which comes to 10d. per play). I do not know of any complete set of these; the Folger Library has a nearly complete set the only missing volume of which is supplied in another broken set. The plays, which have their own titles, are chiefly old remainders, their dates going back as far as 1719 and their imprints representing many publishers. As a stock of old remainders became exhausted, Feales obtained other reprints to fill their places; in all probability he undertook for this purpose the publication of new reprints in conjunction with those publishers who controlled the copyrights. Thus in a volume with a general title-page dated 1731 we may find plays dated 1733. And in the two Folger sets, though they are alike in general titles and contents, a given play may be of two different editions, one 1728, the other 1733. With Feales's later ventures, The British Theatre , in ten volumes, and 'The Beautiful Editions of the Plays with Red Titles and Handsome Frontispieces'—the latter consisting of the old plays issued separately with new (cancel) titles—I am not now concerned. Feales's method of play publishing bears upon our three pirated plays. For all three of them appear in the first volume of The English Theatre , 1731—the three counterfeit reprints, in the order indicated by their imprint dates, complete with titles and advertisements—together with a 1729 edition of Tate's King Lear . The two Folger copies of this volume are identical in every important respect. Now I cannot say how Feales acquired the three reprints. He was not himself a printer, and when he required the services of a printer he usually employed Darby himself, who is in this case, as always so far as I know, above suspicion. Yet it is not impossible—or even unlikely—that Feales was the culprit. Nothing is known about him before 1731, except for the single imprint of 1729 mentioned before. He was not in any case a well-established member of the trade and may well, before he became respectable as the associate of the most substantial stationers of London, have been a shady character not above a barefaced piracy. He may have employed some equally shady printer to do the job for him and, experiencing difficulty in getting the pirated plays off his hands, may have kept them until the assembling of The English Theatre occurred to him. Or he may have acquired a large stock of miscellaneous plays with such a collection in view and, unable to obtain editions of the most popular plays of Shakespeare which he desired for his first volume, may have had them secretly printed for the purpose. On the other hand, it must be regarded as equally possible that Feales, a wholesale dealer in all sorts of plays, bought these three piracies from their real perpetrator, either quite innocently or with some degree of guilt. Perhaps, even, the real pirate was caught, and his stock confiscated, as the Act of 1709 provided, and then acquired by Feales. There seems little to choose between these alternative suggestions. Whichever origin we choose, it seems to me very probable that the three plays were produced not earlier than 1729, and I see no good reason for assigning a date earlier than 1731. The dates on the title-pages of the reprints may of course be ignored. And the similarity of technique in all three, together with the uniformity in execution of the woodblock ornaments, supplies some ground for assuming that the three piracies were carried out by one printer and at one time. When all is said, it must be admitted that we have here but few facts. All that can be said with complete confidence is that the three reprints are piracies, and that William Feales is the only man whom we can connect with them in any way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Mary Poulson of the imprints was the widow of Richard Wellington (d. 1715), who had owned some half dozen Shakespeare copyrights. A. Bettesworth and F. Clay appear to have been trustees of the Wellington estate on behalf of his three minor sons, Richard, James, and Bethel. On the Wellingtons' part in the Shakespeare copyrights see my "The Copyright of Shakespeare's Works", Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild (University of Missouri Studies, 1946), pp. 28-9. 2 H. L. Ford, Shakespeare 1700-1740 (Oxford, 1935), Nos. 47, 167, and 217. 3 No satisfactory explanation has ever been suggested to account for this 18th-century practice of disguising the fact that a reprint, when it follows close on the heels of the first edition, was a reprint. Why not openly denominate the reprint "Second Edition" and thus advertise the popularity of the work? 4 In contrast to this the type-page height of the general title to the second of the 1765 Johnson editions, printed in the same shop as the first and intended to imitate it closely, is more than 9 mm. taller. 5 Addit.

      <field name="heading_text">The Compositor of the "Pied Bull" Lear by Philip Williams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MOST RECENT STUDY OF THE PRINTING of the controversial "Pied Bull" quarto of Lear remarks that the application of a spelling test to determine the number of compositors employed remains a desideratum. 1 Following this suggestion, I have examined the text of the "Pied Bull" Lear and two other play quartos printed by Nicholas Okes, in an attempt to prove, if possible, the number of compositors employed. 2 The technique I use was first developed by Professor Charlton Hinman. 3 It consists, in brief, of identifying the orthographic habits and peculiarities of individual compositors. In addition to supplying three good examples of the reliability of Professor Hinman's test, 4 I think that I can show conclusively that only one compositor was engaged in the production of Lear . In order to prove that the "Pied Bull" Lear is the work of a single compositor, it is first necessary to examine two other dramatic quartos printed by Nicholas Okes. The information thereby obtained concerning the spelling habits of the compositors in the Okes shop can then be applied to the Lear quarto. In 1612, four years after he printed the Lear quarto, Nicholas Okes printed the first quarto of John Webster's The White Devil . An examination of this quarto shows that two compositors were employed. One compositor (whom I designate B) never uses the apostrophe in the form Ile , although he regularly uses it in such forms as He'd, We've , and the like. In addition to this peculiar use of the apostrophe, Compositor B frequently uses ie for final y . The other compositor (whom I designate A) generally uses the apostrophe in the form I'le and, with certain exceptions mentioned below, never uses ie for final y . Both compositors invariably spell certain words with a final y . These words, which are not included in the tabulations because they are non-significant, are: any, away, lay, may, many, pray, say, way , and why . The appearance of Ile/I'le and final y/ie forms is given in the following chart. 5 The tabulation shows that the alternation of the two compositors was not regular. Beginning with B1, Compositor A set B1, B1 v , C1-F2 v , G1-G2 v , H2, H2 v , H4, H4 v , I3, I3 v , I4 v , K1, K3 v -K4 v , L3-M2 v . The quarto consists of 88 pages, 87 of which contain letterpress (the verso of the title page is blank). Of these, Compositor A set 56 pages. The remaining 31 pages were set by Compositor B. 6 In 1609, one year later than the "Pied Bull" Lear , Nicholas Okes printed the first and only quarto of Robert Armin's The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke . An examination of the text of this quarto shows that, as with The White Devil , two compositors were engaged. The two compositors, moreover, are the same two whose work has been identified in the Webster quarto. The following chart shows the occurrence of the significant forms by which their identity can be ascertained. 7 In The Merry Maids of More-clacke , composing started with A1. 8 Compositor B set the following pages: A1, A2 v , A3, B1-B2 v , C1-C2 v , D1-D3, E1-E2 v , F1-F2 v , G1-G2 v , H1-H3, H4 v -I2 v . The title-page was probably set by B. The remaining 31 pages (out of a total of 70) were composed by A. The two compositors generally alternated after setting four type-pages, and the evidence of this alternation is, in the main, quite clear. 9 By combining the evidence obtained from The White Devil and The Two Maids , and tabulating this evidence in percentages, the spelling habits of the two compositors can be summarized as follows: I'le Ile y ie do doe Compositor A 63% 27% 99% 1% 90% 10% Compositor B 0 100% 60% 40% 20% 80% Turning now to the "Pied Bull" Lear quarto, we find that only one compositor was engaged in setting the book, and that this compositor is the Compositor B of The White Devil and The Two Maids of More-clacke . A tabulation of the characteristic forms upon which this spelling test is based is given below. The characteristics that distinguish Compositor B are at once apparent: the absence of the apostrophe in Ile forms, the frequent spellings in final ie , and the preponderance of doe spellings. When presented in percentage form, the figures for Lear are very close to the percentages arrived at by combining the evidence obtained from The White Devil and The Two Maids . In Lear , final ie is used 45% of the time as compared with 40%, and the doe form is used 72% of the time as compared with 80% for The White Devil and The Two Maids . On only two pages, I believe, is the evidence inconclusive. On H4, we find seven final y 's, no final ie spellings, and no Ile forms. The two doe forms suggest Compositor B but are not evidence enough upon which to assign him the work. On L4, the only significant forms appearing are seven final y 's. As Compositor B has, however, set all of the other pages, it seems very likely that he also set H4 and L4. The thirteen settings of the running-titles 10 that appear in the quarto all read The Historie of King Lear . On the strength of the ie spelling, I believe that these, like the rest of the text, were set by Compositor B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Fredson Bowers, "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear," The Library , Fifth Series (1947), II, 35 n.1. 2 This paper is a part of a larger study of Nicholas Okes' printing practices upon which I am engaged. Dr. Greg and Professor Bowers agree that in reconstructing the method of printing employed in Lear "we are bound to explain the peculiarities as the necessary outcome of some normal method of working" (W. W. Greg, The Variants in the First Quarto of "King Lear ": A Bibliographical and Critical Inquiry , p. 45, as quoted in Bowers, op. cit. , p. 40). 3 Charlton Hinman, "Principles Governing the Use of Variant Spellings as Evidence of Alternate Setting by Two Compositors," The Library , Fourth Series (1940), XXI, 78-94. 4 So far as I know, the only published examples of the extensive application of the spelling test are those offered in Professor Hinman's article. 5 Evidence supplied by the running-titles proves that printing started with B gathering, and that A1-A2 v (containing the title-page and preliminary matter) was printed with M1-M2 v by full sheet imposition. After printing, the sheet was divided. I have, therefore, arranged the pages in order of composition: A1-A2 v follows M2 v . 6 The evidence in certain pages is insufficient, and in five cases, somewhat ambiguous. The appearance of a single final y on the title-page is certainly insufficient evidence for assigning the page to A; but as A composed the two following pages, it seems reasonably likely that he set the title-page too. This suggestion becomes even more likely when we note that the pages immediately preceding the title-page (in order of composition) were also set by A. On pages E1, F2 v , G1, H2 v , and I2 v we find a single final ie spelling conflicting with a preponderance of final y spellings; and on F2 v , G1, and H2 v conflicting with I'le forms as well. On E1, the form bodie appears as the final word of a full line, and the unexpected spelling may be explained as the method adopted for justifying the line. The spellings on G1, H2 v , and I2 v seem to be inexplicable exceptions to A's normal spelling habits. The conflict on F2 v , however, is capable of explanation, and suggests a third characteristic that may be of some use in distinguishing the two compositors. The word merrie appears on the fourth line from the bottom ofthe page. In the preceding line, the word do appears three times, each time spelled do . On the last line of the page the word appears spelled doe . A tabulation of the occurrence of do/doe forms throughout the book reveals that B shows a marked preference for the doe form; A is predisposed toward the do form. It would, therefore, seem probable that Compositor A set the first 33 lines on F2 v , and was then relieved by Compositor B who set the remaining four lines and the three following pages. (A similar case is cited by Professor Hinman, op. cit. , p. 90). 7 As in the previous tabulation, words invariably spelled with a final y by both compositors are not included. 8 The evidence provided by the running-titles proves that printing began with text gathering A. As in The White Devil , the title-page and preliminary matter, consisting of two pages signed a , were printed along with the final two-page gathering by full sheet imposition. The running-title appearing on the versos reads "The History(ie) of the two". Four such running-titles are used. Two read "Historie", and were, I believe, set by Compositor B. The other two, reading "History", were probably set by Compositor A. 9 On certain pages the evidence is inconclusive, and on others, somewhat ambiguous. The one ie form on the title-page is hardly sufficient evidence to assign the composition of the title-page to B. On A4, one ie spelling (curtesie) conflicts with twenty y spellings. The same word, this time spelled "courtesie", appears on H3 v , where it conflicts with ten final y spellings. On B4 v , the form "weie" (for weigh ) appears twice. I believe "weie" may have been A's normal spelling. On D4 and F3 v , the spelling "busie" occurs; and on D4, we also find "obloquie". On the strength of these two ie forms on D4, plus the single Ile form and the one spelling doe , the page should probably be assigned to Compositor B. To do so, however, upsets the quite regular alternation that precedes and follows. On G3 v , G4, and G4 v , the single ie spellings seem to be inexplicable variations from A's normal habits. On B1 and D1, pages clearly composed by B, we find the form Il'e . A possible explanation may be that B, attempting to follow his copy closely, misplaced the apostrophe in setting the word. 10 Bowers, op. cit. , pp. 21-22.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Five Bookes of Ovid's Metamorphosis, 1621, Englished by James G. McManaway</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DISCOVERY 1 DURING THE SUMMER OF 1947 of a copy of The First Five Bookes of Ovids Metamorphosis "Imprinted for W:B: 1621" puts an end to many conjectures 2 about this mysterious and elusive littlc book; but not to all, for according to the title-page, it belongs to "edit: 2d." The copy, which was acquired for the Folger Shakespeare Library, may be the very one of which just one hundred and forty years ago Joseph Haslewood supplied to Sir Egerton Brydges the following account: Art. IV. The First Five Bookes of Ovid's Metamorphosis, Second Edition. Imprinted for W.B. 1621. 16 mo pp. 141, besides Introduction . This edition of the translation of Ovid by Geo. Sandys, is unnoticed in all the lists of his works. The title is engraved on a curtain, supported by two flying Cupids; above the curtain, Venus lying on a couch of clouds, holding a burning heart, attended with doves and the god of love, and below a full assembly of the heathen deities. "Fr. Delaram, sculp." 2a A head of Ovid in an oval, with verses beneath, as in the folios. "Ovid defended," is the only article prefixed to this edition, which has a trifling variance from the subsequent ones, as giving "Ovid's selfe-censure," a translation of the concluding lines of lib. 15 . . . Of the edition, dated 1621, I have never seen any other copy than the one above described. The date of the first edition of the five books yet remains to be ascertained. 3 More than once the failure of scholars to locate this or any other copy of the book—nowhere is the name of the owner of the copy in question stated—has led to speculation about the accuracy of Haslewood's description and even about his honesty. 4 The vindication of the antiquary, who suffered deeply from the scorn of some of his more genteel contemporaries, in this instance may help to validate his other contributions to bibliography. The Folger copy of The First Five Bookes —which, until another comes to light, I shall call unique—corresponds in almost every detail to that described by Haslewood. The book, which measures 6.4 x 10.2 cm., is actually a duodecimo and not a sexagesimo. When purchased, it possessed only the rear cover and portions of the backstrip of eighteenth-century calf, and its condition was such that after a careful examination the book was taken apart and then rebound in green niger. On blank leaf ¶6 v , written in a childish scrawl as part of a doggerel statement of ownership, is the name of Thomas Hickman. The collation appears to be, ¶ 6 A-F 12 (F12, possibly a blank, wanting). Leaves "¶1/6 were not conjugate, each having been backed with heavy wove paper. For this reason the collation . . . cannot be entirely certain; but the exact correspondence of chain-lines made it appear highly probable that these two leaves had originally been conjugate . . . All other pairs of leaves were normally conjugate except F2/11, F3/10, of which there was every reason to believe that they had originally been conjugate." 5 Contents: ¶1 r , engraved title; ¶1 v , blank; ¶2 r -6 r , "OVID DEFENDED"; ¶6 v , blank; A1 r -F11 r , the text; F11 v , blank. Pp. [xii] + 141. It will be noticed immediately that the Folger copy lacks a leaf bearing the head of Ovid engraved in an oval, with verses beneath. Probably this was a frontispiece which was lost at the time the little book lost its front cover. 6 The title-page is exactly as Haslewood described it, and the prefatory defense of Ovid begins, as Haslewood said it did, with a translation from the concluding lines of Book XV of the Metamorphoses . These points have been conjecturally called in question, and it is doing simple justice to Haslewood to affirm his accuracy. The first sentence of "Ovid Defended" is identical in the editions of 1621 and 1626, 7 except that the words "from detraction" have been added in line 3 of the later edition. In the 12mo, the second sentence is as follows: And, in that the traduced may with modesty enough report their owne merits, I will first begin with a OVID'S SELFE-CENSVRE. Now haue I ended, what the Thunders rage, Nor fire, nor steele shall raze, nor eating Age. Come when it wil my death's vncertayn houre; Which o're this body onely hath a powre. Yet shall my better part transcend the skie: And my immortall Name shall neuer die. For, wheresoe're the Roman Egles spred Their conquering wings, I shall of all be read. And, if we Prophets true presages giue; I, in my fame, eternally shall liue. 8 The reference "a," is identified on ¶6 r as "L. 15 in fin." The preface continues: "A prediction already confirmed by many lustres of Ages. Heare we now that accurate Orator, Marcus Annaevs Seneca." The section continues as in 1626 until Erasmus is reached, where the earlier edition provides an ampler testimony. After Stephanus, 1626 inserts Marcus Antonius Tritonius and Bernardus Martinus. There are occasional variations in the wording of the transitional sentences. Though the book was originally entered in the registers of the Company of Stationers to Matthew Lownes and William Barrett on 27 April 1621, 9 the engraved title-page of the second edition names only W[illiam B[arrett]. 9a The printer of this edition is unknown, and no guesses as to his identity can be hazarded because the book contains no printer's devices, no ornaments, and no initial letters. From the date of the second edition, it is obvious that the book was popular, for a reprint was called for within twelve months of the date of entry. The relationship between the second edition of 1621 and the folio of 1626 is very close. In the preliminaries, for example, the edition of 1626 has on the verso of the leaf of dedication an engraving that has for its central feature the head of Ovid in an oval, with verses beneath; this corresponds to the engraving described by Haslewood but now wanting in the Folger copy of the 1621 edition. Each edition has an engraved title-page, but these differ radically. And each edition has a section enentitled, "Ovid Defended." 10 It is in the texts of the translation that the editions most closely resemble each other. These may be minutely collated for page after page without discovery of even a literal difference. From time to time, the compositors of the 1621 edition were forced by the length of a line to use an ampersand or to indicate the omission of "n" or "m" by printing a vowel with a tilde. 11 Occasionally 1626 corrects a typographical error in 1621 12 or introduces one. 13 Sandys devoted much attention to smoothing the metre of the lines in the edition of 1626, frequently altering the spelling of a dissyllabic word to insure that it should be pronounced as a monosyllable and eliding e's and o's before vowels or the letter h. 14 Otherwise, except for verbal changes or alterations in the translation, which will be discussed together in another connection, the text of the first five books of the 1626 edition agrees to a remarkable degree with that of the edition of 1621. Only in the reprinting of Bibles, I think, will such literal correspondence be found in other seventeenth-century books. If this be true, it follows that a corrected copy of the second edition of 1621 must have been supplied to the printer in 1626 for the use of his compositors, 14a and the accuracy of the reprint suggests that Sandys read the proofs zealously. Now if a copy of the second edition of 1621 was used as printer's copy in 1626, it is a safe presumption not only that this second edition was an exceptionally faithful reprint of the first edition of 1621 but that the latter was printed from a manuscript supplied by Sandys himself. It would follow that Sandys planned the book and its engravings in conjunction with his publishers, William Barrett and Matthew Lownes. 15 While Sandys was in Virginia, William Barrett died, and on 3 April 1626, his relict, Mistress Barrett, conveyed to John Parker her rights in a number of books, including Sandys's Ovid . 16 Then, a little more than one month later, William Stansby entered " A booke Called Ovids Metamorphosis XV bookes , in English verse by George Sandes." 17 Although the imprint on the engraved title-page names neither printer nor publisher and the colophon reads, "Printed by William Stansby 1626," it may be presumed that Stansby served as publisher of this edition, for in 1626 Sandys expected to return shortly to Virginia. He probably assumed that his rights in the book were fully protected by the pregnant words, "Cum Priuilegio," engraved on the title-page. This phrase alludes to letters patent granted by King Charles to Sandys on 24 April 1626 18 that gave him exclusive publishing rights for twenty-one years. 19 These rights he had to assert within two years, for Robert Young published an octavo reprint of the complete translation early in 1628. The details of the transaction by which Young became possessed of rights in the book are obscure. Matthew Lownes was dead before 10 April 1627, for on that date many of his titles were transferred to his son Thomas, 20 but not the Ovid. Soon after, Thomas Lownes conveyed a large group of books to Humphrey Lownes and Robert Young, 21 but again the Ovid is not named. Yet the minutes of Court Book C, are explicit in their statement that "the assignm t to Robt Younge . . . shalbe . . . Crost out of the Regester Booke of the Company." It must be assumed that in a private and unrecorded transaction 22 Matthew Lownes had before his death transferred to Young his interest in The First Five Bookes , as recorded long before on 27 April 1621, and that Young had, somewhat unethically perhaps, taken advantage of this right in five books to reprint the complete translation of fifteen books. The wording of the minute in the Court Book suggests that, though he had provided Stansby with a copy of the 1621 edition to print from in 1626, Sandys considered his Fifteen Books an independent publication and that he gave no compensation to John Parker, who had acquired William Barrett's rights in The First Five Bookes , or to Matthew Lownes, who had transferred his rights in the duodecimo to Robert Young. 23 It is my belief, as stated above, that William Stansby, printer of the folio of 1626, probably served only as Sandys's agent. But the outraged poet took no chances when he made his demands upon the Company of Stationers: the minute records that Mr Sandes Patent for the sole printing of the 15. bookes of Ovides Metamorphosis by him translated into English verse was openlye reade in the hall this quarter day. And it is ordered that th' entrance of M r Barret and M r Lownes deceased of the first five books and the assignm t to Robt Younge, and the Entrance of the whole 15. bookes to mr Stansby shalbe all Crost out of the Regester Booke of the Company for that noe man shall laye anie claime to the printing of the same or any pte thereof. 24 And so it was done, but the transfer of Mistress Barrett's rights to Parker was somehow overlooked. Between the years 1621 and 1626 Sandys made a number of revisions of his translation of the first five books of the Metamorphoses . Some of these appear to have been introduced for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the translation. Thus the reading of 1621 (p. 9, line 24), "Or must th' Earth be by saluages possest?" is changed in 1626 to "Must Earth be onely by wild beasts possest?" ( Met. 1. 249, ferisne paret populandas tradere terras). Again, "trembling" ( 1621 , p. 80, line 28) is corrected to "wrathfull" (cf. Met. III. 577, ira tremendos), and "Epogus" ( 1621 , p. 82, line 13) to "Epopeus" (cf. Met. III. 619). More frequently Sandys amended his translation to improve the Latin pronunciation of proper names. In 1621 (p. 23, line 31), Pleias is trisyllabic, with the accent on the second syllable: But, calls his sonne, of bright Pleïas bred; in 1626 both syllabification and accent are changed: But, calls his sonne, of fulgent Pleias bred; ( Met. 1. 670, Pleias enixa est letoque det imperat Argum). In one case at least, Sandys corrected the pronunciation of one name at the expense of another. In 1621 (p. 36, line 13), he was not satisfied with his rendition of "Citheron": Mycale , with the sacred Citheron: so he revised it to High Mycale , diuine Cithaeron , wast: (cf. Met. 11. 223, Dindymaque et Mycale natusque ad sacra Cithaeron), thus doing violence to the pronunciation of "Mycale." Some of the revisions entail the rewriting of a complete line or even a couplet. The ravishment of Io, (1. 599-600) is rendered thus in 1621 (p. 21, lines 21-22): With darknesse he the Earth inveloped; And catching her, inforc't her Maiden-head. In 1626 , the couplet is changed to read: He in the Aire a sable cloud displai'd, Caught, and devirginat's the strugling Maid. The account of Phaeton's conversation with Apollo ( Met. 11. 33-34) appears in 1621 (P. 29, lines 27-28) as follows: What brought thee hither, Phaeton , said hee, My dearest sonne? well worthy so to bee. In 1626 , the passage is altered thus: Who said, What hether drew thee Phaeton , Who art, and worthily my dearest Son? Once Sandys rewrites a passage ( Met. 111. 185-88) to secure greater precision and compression. In 1621 (p. 66, line 31— p. 67, line 3), five lines are required: When from her aged Love shee takes her flight: Such was Diana's , taken in that plight. Although inuiron'd by her Virgin trayne, Shee side-long turneth, casting with disdayne A killing looke; and wisht her deadly Bowe: Three lines suffice in 1626: Such flusht in Dians cheeks, being naked tane. And though inuiron'd by her Virgin trayne, Shee side-long turnes, looks back, and wisht her bow: . . . The later version profits by the removal of the couplet that elaborates the reference in the preceding line to "rosie Morn," and in this revision Elizabethan exuberance can be seen yielding to classical correctness. Other examples might be cited of Sandys's efforts to polish his lines, but these indicate the care he expended on the translation. Now that the finding of a copy of the second edition of The First Five Bookes of Ovids Metamorphosis has cleared Joseph Haslewood of charges of inaccuracy (or worse) and thrown new light on the history of Sandys's famous translation, it remains to inquire once again whether this book in the edition of 1626 may be considered the first published verse in the English language which was written on the mainland of North America. 25 The answer must be given in the negative. Another "American" poem preceded it by fully three years. In Catalogue 77, A Selection of Extremely Rare and Important Printed Books and Ancient Manuscripts issued early in 1948 by the London firm of William H. Robinson Ltd., item 98 is a broadside ballad entitled, "Good Newes from Virginia . . ." 26 This was published without date in London "for John Trundle," but the title informs us that the poem was "Sent from Iames his Towne this present moneth of March, 1623 by a Gentleman in that Country." Since the ballad gives a highly circumstantial account of the Indian massacre of 1622, the date is probably accurate and the attribution of authorship correct. The author may have been "a Gentleman," but surely his literary attainments were of the slightest, if the ballad is a fair measure. The first stanza is typical: No English heart, but heard with griefe the massacre here done: And how by sauage trecheries, full many a mothers sonne: But God that gaue them power and leaue, their cruelties to vse, Hath giuen them vp into our hands, who English did abuse. There is no need to detail the evidence of the author's first-hand knowledge of events. The ballad may be read in the facsimile provided in the bookseller's catalogue. It has, moreover, been available to scholars and historians in another form for eight years, having been reproduced as Number 105 in "Photostat Americana, Second Series," in May 1940 from the copy in the Public Record Office in London. 27 Appropriately enough, this rare ballad, generally overlooked by literary historians, includes a fine tribute to George Sandys: Stout Master George Sands vpon a night, did brauely venture forth: And mong'st the sauage murtherers, did forme a deed of worth. For finding many by a fire, to death their liues they pay: Set fire of a Towne of theires, and brauely came away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 It is a pleasure to record my thanks to Mr. Lionel Robinson for putting me in touch with the owner, who had found the book in a barrow in front of an obscure bookshop. 2 For an historical survey of the facts hitherto known to bibliographers and scholars, and of their hypotheses, see Richard Beale Davis, "Early Editions of George Sandys's 'Ovid': The Circumstances of Production," The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XXXV (1941), 255-76. 2a A comparison of this engraving with photostats from the University of Chicago Library and Harvard University Library indicates that Delaram copied in reverse the unsigned engraving which serves as the general title of a duodecimo edition published in Amsterdam in 1619 by Guilielmus Ianssonius with the title, Pub: Ovidii Nasonis Opera (another copy is credited to Mills College and a fourth to the Bibliothèque Nationale). The work also appears in a 1624 edition (cf. copies credited to the American Antiquarian Society and to the Bibliothèque Nationale), but Dr. Brigham writes me that the copy in the library of the American Antiquarian Society is not a Jansson publication. The title-page of this edition, which has no engraved general title, reads as follows: " Publii Ovidii Nasonis Operum Tomus I. quo continentur Heroidum Epistola. Amorum Libri III. De arte Amandi Libri tres. De Remedio Amoris Libri II. Et alia, qua aversa pagella indicat . [cut of 2 globes] Amsterdami Apud Guilielmum Caesium Anno MDCXXiiii." The appearance of the name Caesium suggests that the copy listed in the catalogue of the Bibl. Nat. as by "G. Janss. Caesium" may be inaccurately described. In 1629 the Jansson edition was reprinted with a different title, Pub: Ovidii Nas: Opera. Daniel Heinsius textum recensuit , by Ioannes Ianssonus (I have used a photostat of the title-page of the Harvard copy; other copies of this edition are in the Boston Public Library, the Washington and Lee University Library, the British Museum, and the Bibliothèque Nationale). This 1629 edition has an engraved title-page, unsigned, that is closely copied from that of 1619. According to the catalogue of the Bibliothèque Nationale, later editions were published by J. Jansson in 1634 and 1647 and by J. Blaeu in 1649. I am indebted to Dr. F. T. Bowers for directing my attention to the Dutch engraving and to F. C. Francis, Esq., Mr. William A. Jackson, Dr. Clarence S. Brigham, and Mr. P. G. Morrison for assistance in securing photostats and collecting other information about the Jansson editions. 3 Censura Literaria (1808), vi, 132-33, 135. 4 It has been hinted that the entry in Censura Literaria is a fabrication of the sort frequently attributed to John Payne Collier—cf. Davis, op. cit. , pp. 261-62. 5 Quoted from the bibliographical note by my colleague, Dr. Giles E. Dawson, Curator of Books and Manuscripts, which is inserted at the end of the volume. Similar signed notes are placed in every old book which is rebound at the Folger. The old calf cover is mounted inside the rear cover. 6 If the frontispiece was printed on leaf F12 which was then detached and prefixed to the book, its loss would be readily accounted for. 7 Upon his return from Virginia in 1626, Sandys published in a small folio his translation of all fifteen books—see below. See further Davis, op. cit. , and also his "America in George Sandys' 'Ovid'," The William and Mary Quarterly , 3d. Ser., IV (1947), 297-304. 8 Readers may wish to compare this 1621 version with the translation that appears at the end of the folio of 1626: And now the Work is ended, which, Ioue's rage, Nor Fire, nor Sword shall raze, nor eating Age. Come when it will my deaths vncertain howre; Which onely of my body hath a powre: Yet shall my better Part transcend the skie; And my immortall name shall neuer die. For, where-so-ere the Roman Eagles spread Their conquering wings, I shall of all be read: And, if we Prophets truly can diuine, I, in my liuing Fame, shall euer shine. 9 Arber's reprint, iv, 53. (If Haslewood had had access to the Stationers' Registers, he might have guessed that the first edition was almost certainly dated 1621.) This is the first entry of Sandys's translation. The compilers of the S.T.C. err, as pointed out by Russell H. Barker, T.L.S. , 27 Sept. 1934, p. 655, and again by R. B. Davis, "Early Editions," p. 259, note 14, in identifying Sandys's work with the one entered to Jonas Man on 23 February 1617/18. The earlier book, "Ouids metamorphosis gramaticallie translated by John Bringsley" is in fact S.T.C. 18963, of which two copies (British Museum and Folger) are extant. Printed by Humphrey Lownes for Thomas Man in 1618, it is a textbook translation of Metamorphoses , Bk. I, by the celebrated teacher and Puritan divine, John Brinsley. Davis, loc. cit. , mistakenly credits the entry of 23 Feb. 1617/18 to "master Lownes"; instead the entry was to Jonas Man "vnder the handes of Master Lownes senior warden." pa Until a copy of the first edition of 1621 is discovered, it cannot be known whether the words "edit:2d." were added to the plate at the time the book was reprinted, or even whether the first edition had an engraved title. But certain minor differences in the formation of the letters suggest the possibility that "edit:2d." is an addition. If so, the insertion did not crowd the adjacent lines unpleasantly, but it should be noted that the absence of "edit:2d." would not spoil the appearance of the page. 10 See note 8 above for detailed comparison. I wish to record my indebtedness to my colleague, Dr. E. E. Willoughby, for several suggestions and to my son, James G. McManaway, Jr., for valuable assistance. 11 Cf. 1621 , p. 20, line 27: To streams, &amp; gentle Nymphs that streams frequet. and 1626 , p. 15, line 32: To streams, and gentle Nymphs that streams frequent. 12 Cf. 1621 , p. 8, line 10: Nor rhine, for Thee, lesse thought, Augustus , tooke, with 1626 , p. 6, line 13: Nor thine, for Thee, less thought, Augustus , tooke, 13 Cf. 1621 , p. 9, line 4: An other part on hissing Embers broyles. with 1626 , p. 6, line 39: An other patt on hissing Embers broyles; 14 Cf. 1621 , p. 40, l. 17: Nor lesse the Heliades lament; who shead with 1626 , p. 30, l. 19. Nor lesse th' Heliades lament; who shead or 1621 , p. 67, l. 10: To his Browe th' antlers of long-liuing Harts: with 1626 , p. 50, l. 20: T' his Browe th' antlers of long-liuing Harts: 14a It is possible that 1626 was set from a copy of the lost first edition. If so, the printer of the second edition must have worked with remarkable accuracy, for the close correspondence observable between the editions of 1621 and 1626 is rarely found in two independent printings of a copy text. 15 The fact that one of the publishers, Lownes, to whom the first edition of 1621 was entered was a warden of the Company lends additional weight to my belief that the 1621 venture was not piratical, as has been more than once suggested. 16 Arber, IV, 157-58. 17 7 May 1626. See Arber, IV, 160. 18 A typographical error in D.N.B. causes Sir Sidney Lee to seem to date this grant 1621, to the confusion of scholarship. 19 Noted by Alexander Brown, Genesis of the U. S. (1840), II, 994; Davis cites the edition of 1880. 20 Arber, IV, 176. 21 On 30 May 1627; cf. Arber, IV, 180. 22 For a preliminary discussion of this and other interesting points of copyright practice, see Giles E. Dawson, "The Copyright of Shakespeare's Dramatic Works," in Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fairchild , ed. C. T. Prouty, The University of Missouri Studies xxxi (1946), 12-14. The subject is treated at greater length in his forthcoming essay, "Copyright of Plays in the Early Seventeenth Century," in The English Institute Annual , 1947 (Columbia University Press). 23 It is possible, of course, that Young acquired these rights prior to Sandys's return to London in 1626 and that some arrangement should have been made with him instead of with Lownes. 14 See Davis, "Early Editions," pp. 270-71, for this text and an account of later troubles that beset Sandys. 25 Professor Davis has demonstrated that although Books vi-xv were translated on the voyage to America or while Sandys was in residence in Virginia, the first explicit references to the American scene occur in the commentary of the edition of 1632—cf. his "America in George Sandys' 'Ovid'," cited above. 26 The ballad is to be sung to the tune of "All those that be good fellowes." It consists of two parts, the first of eight stanzas, and the second of fourteen stanzas. Below the title are a woodcut of a ship and another of an armed man, surveying the corpses that lie at his feet. 27 Reproductions are available in the fifteen American libraries that subscribe to "Photostat Americana." The stanza quoted below is printed by Davis, "Early Editions," p. 265, from E. D. Neill, Virginia vetusta (1885), 147-48.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Art of Selling Books: Notes on three Aldus Catalogues, 1586-1592 by Rudolf Hirsch</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION Conventional histories of literature and orthodox bibliography have paid scant attention to the reaction of the reading public to book production. Sociologists, public opinion analysts, and commercial interests have recognized the importance of current problems of "literary taste." What are the reasons for the neglect of the historical aspects of readers' reactions? The scarcity of objective data would appear to be the obvious explanation. However, we possess a mass of information which can profitably be utilized in analyzing the reception by the public of specific titles or groups of publications. The first and main sources are data on the periodicity, or frequency of republication, a barometer of public appeal, which can be assembled with comparative ease by the scholar well trained in the use of bibliographical tools. Another, more obscure source, is found in the advertisements and catalogues issued by publishers and bookdealers with some frequency since the 15th century. Specimens of this latter type are the subject of this paper. The firm of Aldus, founded in 1494 by Aldo Manuzio and continued successfully by his son Paolo, fell into comparative decline under his grandson Aldo Manuzio, the Younger. From 1581 on, the business was conducted largely by Niccolo Manassi who, in the words of Renouard 1 exploited "non sans quelque capacité, l'immense réputation de cette typographie célèbre." Renouard who takes a somewhat dim view of Manassi's stewardship, comments on him, under the year 1586, as follows: "L'imprimerie, régie par Nicolas Manassi . . . se trouve réduite à bien peu de chose. Il paroît que son exploitation se bornoit presque à la vente du peu de livres restés en magasin." This statement is not entirely correct. His activities as a publisher, between the years 1581 and 1586, compare not unfavorably with those of the younger Aldus. That more than a few books were still in stock becomes evident upon examination of the "Libri di stampa d'Aldo che si trovano al presente" (see illustrations). It seems, however, true that Manassi was eager to reduce the stock at hand; or so we deduce from his use, from 1586 on, of a new kind of sales catalogues, published as appendices of the firm's regular publications. As far as could be ascertained, he was the first to use his own publications as vehicles for advertising the remaining, unsold stock. This technique, used today on book jackets, common in books during the 19th century, is generally associated with English 17th century printers who used it to promote the sale of dramatic publications. 2 Little or no attention has been paid to the sales catalogues of Aldus, though Renouard mentioned them, had seen 23, and listed 21. 3 He reprints the sales catalogue found in LeRoy, 1592 (R.248, 3) "parce qu'il est un des plus amples"; he refers to it as the sixth Aldus catalogue. Five earlier publishers' lists of the firm were printed separately, and issued in the years 1498, 1503, 1513 (two catalogues) and 1563. The 1586-1598 series, of which our sales catalogues are part, covers a comparatively short period. Its catalogues are characterized by the fact that they were printed as part of regular publications, and list only items still available ("che si trovano"), and therefore unsold. By examining items not sold, in the light of total production, we can arrive at an estimate of the attitude of the reading public towards Aldus publications. Since items—except for pre-publication announcements—are priced, a comparison of the sales catalogues provides data on book price variations. Finally, the listing itself is brief and not too clear, as was customary for all early bibliographies and catalogues; nevertheless, sufficient points of some bibliographical value have been clarified, beyond the information previously supplied in the comprehensive study of Renouard, to justify further investigation of such sales catalogues. The designation "nuovo" (or "nuova," "nuovi") found following the indication of size in the 1586 and 1589 catalogues, remains a riddle. The most likely interpretation is that it refers to reprint editions, an explanation which holds true for a majority of items designated "nuovo." It cannot mean recent publications, since the imprints cover the range from 1575 to 1589. It may mean new, as against second-hand copies, but this is highly doubtful, since it is assumed that most items advertised were available in several copies, as must definitely be the case for the 1586-1589 imprints, just off the press and presumably all new. It seems unlikely that "nuovo" refers to a special kind of size, since it is used in connection with folio, 4to, 8vo and 16mo. Sales catalogues chosen here for the comparative study are those printed in Armandus, Declaratio (1586) 4 and Bobali, Rime (1589) 5 The relative position of individual items in those catalogues is indicated in the tabular presentation, preceding the price. Data from the LeRoy list of 1592 have been added to illustrate the sales progress during the three following years. Since the 1592 catalogue includes the dates of printing, it is of particular value in identifying editions in the two earlier catalogues. By re-arranging chronologically the items listed in the sales catalogues of the Armandus and the Bobali, the business success of Manassi and the Aldus family is portrayed somewhat in the fashion of an inventory.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSION The first two items in the tabular presentation are the only "remainders" from the period of Andrea Asolano who conducted the affairs of the Aldus establishment from 1515 to 1529. They like the following items (nos. 3-5) were apparently sold out between the years 1586 and 1589. Six items (nos. 6-11) belong to the late period of Paolo Manuzio. The rest (nos. 12-76) are the products of the younger Aldo Manuzio or his manager Manassi. In the tabular presentation the number of items, listed by year in Renouard, is added in parentheses after the years 1563 to 1589, to provide comparative information on sales versus production. Thus, we find that of 185 publications listed by Renouard for the period 1563-1574 6 all but six had been sold out by 1586. Quite obviously the picture is less favorable as we approach the date of 1586. Of 64 items listed in the 1586 sales catalogue, thirteen (nos. 1-5, 8, 10, 23, 25, 36, 43, 51, and 60), or roughly one-fifth were not relisted in the catalogue of 1589, and therefore were probably sold. However, two of these were again listed in 1592, possibly as single copies. Eight more items (nos. 7, 12, 24, 27, 49, 58, 63, and 76) from the original 64 were omitted in the 1592 listing and can be considered "out-of-print." Three items (nos. 9, 16, and 20), though printed between 1569 and 1578, are listed in the 1592 catalogue only; they may possibly be single copies. Several items were listed in one of the catalogues in one edition, sold out, reprinted, and listed in another edition in a later catalogue, as for example Tasso's Aminta (nos. 43 and 74). Unfortunately we do not possess information on the size of editions, or the number of copies still available at the time of listing. In any case, this new type of advertising must have been successful and profitable; otherwise Manassi would not have continued the practice as persistently as he did. The prices are in Venetian lire (or librae, livres, pounds) and soldi. A comparison with book prices of other publishers of the period has not been attempted. Price increases between lists (nos. 12-15, 18, 34, 37, 57, 59, 64, and 76) reflect the continued rise of prices, typical for the second half of the 16th century. Why, in contrast, the prices of a few items (nos. 24, 61 and especially 71, the last drastically reduced from 1.10 to 0.10, if not a typographical error) were reduced, is difficult to understand, except that complete failure to sell may have been the reason. As stated in the introduction, the ability to sell is an indicator of "literary taste". It is beyond the scope of this study to draw any conclusions in this matter, except for pointing to some few examples: Of seven Tasso items (nos. 42-46, 53 and 74) only the Aminta (nos. 43 and 74) seems to have been a commercial success. All others remained listed throughout. Of nine Cicero items (nos. 8, 13, 22, 29, 34-35, 38-40) only the earliest imprint, the Epistolae ad Atticum , 1569, in Italian, went out of print between 1586 and 1592. In all these cases competition from other publishers has undoubtedly been a contributing factor. But the competition was equally heavy for items which were sold successfully. It may therefore, be safe to say that Tasso's Rime, Padre di famiglia , and Rinaldo were not too popular in the 1580's. Similarly it would appear that Cicero, most esteemed during the 15th and first half of the 16th century, had lost ground by the end of this century and that only the lower intelligentsia, the literate whose reading was limited to works in his native tongue, prolonged enthusiasm for Ciceronian writings. Similar and less obvious conclusions could probably be drawn upon a complete analysis of the Aldus sales catalogues; but this task is left to the literary historian. Bibliographical puzzles (or solutions) in connection with this study are few. They are found in notes 4, 5, 8, 9 and 12 of the tabular presentation. A more extended investigation of all known Aldus sales catalogues—a long range plan—may well unearth considerably more, and more valuable, information.</field>

Since he describes only an edition in 8vo, this is either an error, or, if truly an edition in 16mo, it is unknown to R. 5 R. does not know a reprint of v.2; v.2 may therefore be a "remainder" from the 1575 edition, or it is unknown to R. 6 5 Tasso items, part of the Rime e prose , but sold separately. 7 Reissue of volumes first issued separately. 8 Renouard has not seen this volume and doubts its existence. 9 Listed by Renouard under 1589; he has not seen it and quotes it from the 1589 Catalogue. 10 Pre-publication announcement of 1587 edition. 11 The 1586 listing refers either to the 1580 edition, or is a pre-publication announcement. The 1592 listing gives the date 1580, which is curious, if not a mistake. The latter is quite plausible, since the editions of 1576, 1580 and 1587 are identical except for the first eight leaves. 12 Renouard 227,2 says: "Les catalogues d'Alde en indiquent une edition que je ne connois point." 6 Including some items printed outside Venice.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Text of Chaucer's Purse * by George B. Pace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">T HE COMPLAYNT OF CHAUCER TO HIS PURSE is preserved in ten manuscripts and also in Caxton's print, which, representing a lost manuscript, ranks as an authority. As one would expect, the manuscripts all vary; but by and large the variations are slight, and it is frequently difficult to tell, on a priori grounds, significant from non-significant variation. Professor Robinson regards the classification of the texts as uncertain. 1 The uncertainty of which Professor Robinson speaks is well shown in the three published classifications. 2 They are similar in that each divides the manuscripts 3 into two groups independently descended from a lost original. 4 But this similarity is not real, for the components of the two groups are different in each classification, as one can see from footnote 4 above. Such confusion suggests that a bifid arrangement is wrong. In great part the confusion almost certainly arises from the slightness of the variations. Each editor presumably regards a somewhat different set of readings as significant for grouping the manuscripts. 5 With long poems, of course, it is often necessary to limit the number of variants—for practical reasons. The Purse is short, however, and by considering all of the variant readings, I believe I can show that a trifid arrangement is correct. The classification proposed in this paper is hence complete; 6 and whether one agrees with the argument or not, one has before one all of the evidence upon which a classification may be based. The Purse manuscripts, with their sigils, are as follows: 7 A Additional 22139. British Museum. F. 138 a . A 2 Additional 34360. British Museum. F. 19 a . CC 1 , CC 2 MS. 176. Caius and Gonville College, Cambridge. Pp. 12 (CC 1 ), 23 (CC 2 ). Cx Caxton's Anelida and arcite . F. 9 a -9 b . F Fairfax 16. Bodleian. F. 193 a . Ff Ff. 1. 6. Cambridge University Library. F. 59 a . H Harley 2251. British Museum. F. 298 a . H 2 Harley 7333. British Museum. F. 148 a . M MS. 4. Morgan Library. F. 77 a . P Pepys 2006. Magdalene College, Cambridge. P. 388. If my reasoning is correct, the following is the most probable tree for these texts. I. In explaining the tree, we may begin most conveniently with the lowest MS. on it—A 2 . Miss Hammond has proved that H and A 2 are sister MSS, 8 but it is nevertheless obvious that A 2 has no independent textual value for the Purse . Because the reading of H in line 11, Ie-lownesse (for yelownesse ), is obviously more authoritative than the reading of A 2 , eye lownesse , I have chosen H as the exemplar which more closely approximates the common original of H and A 2 , and have hence diagramed A 2 as descended from H and have omitted a separate discussion of it. II. H and M share several readings found in no other MSS 9 and hence must be considered as closely related. Neither can be considered as descended from the other, however, for each text reads uniquely in places where the other agrees with the rest of the MSS. 10 First, M's unique readings (H's readings agree here with all other MSS): 15. Omits to me; H to me 16. Om. downe; H downe 17. pis night; H thurgh youre myght Note also this reading in M: 7, 14, 21. y muste; H must I , the word-order of the rest of the MSS. Now, H's unique readings (M's readings agree with the rest of the MSS): 2. Om. be; M be 3. Om. nowe; M nowe 10. To . . . as; M Or . . . lyke 12. feere; M stere 20. Om. thus; M thus Note also these readings in H: 5. on biere; M vpon my bere , the reading of all MSS except P Cx (see section VI below, in which it is shown that P Cx have a common original). 15. my lif my light; M my hertis light . Both readings are unique, yet M's is closer to the generally supported reading, my lyves lyght . H and M share these unique readings: 11. H yowre Ie-lownesse bath no peere; M youre yelownes bathe no pere . For reasons which will become apparent, Chaucer's original (the x of the tree) must be assumed to have read That of yelownesse had neuer pere . 16. souerayn lady . The rest of the MSS read saveour . 20. Both MSS read line 6 here and omit the usual But yet I pray unto your curtesye . On the basis of the above shared unique readings, we may assume ex 2 HM, 11 which we may call a . The significant readings of a are as follows: 1. to 4. yf 5. Me were as lefe to be leyde vpon my bere 7, 14, 21. must I 10. Or se 11. That of youre yelownesse hath no pere 13. Quene of comforte and of company 15. Now purse 16. And souerayne lady downe in this world here 18. Sith 20. ffor which vnto yowre mercy thus I crye 22ff. Om. Envoy III. CC 2 and a share several unique readings. Because of the following unique reading in a , however, we cannot assume the descent a &gt; CC 2 : 11. That of youre yelownesse hath no pere . CC 2 , which reads neuer no pere , must belong with the MSS in which neuer occurs (i.e., all except a); further, CC 2 omits youre with all other MSS. Nor, because of the following unique readings in CC 2 (where a and the rest of the MSS agree), can we assume the descent a &lt; CC 2 : 1. Om. to; a to 15ff. CC 2 om. third stanza and envoy; a , although it omits the envoy, contains the third stanza. Note also these readings in CC 2 : 4. Om. yf; a yf , the reading of all other MSS except A Cx P. 12 5. Me were A leef to be layd opon my bere; a Me were as lefe to be leyde upon my bere , a reading closer to the generally supported reading, which omits to . CC 2 and a share the following unique readings: 5. to be leyde upon my bere . All other MSS om. to . 11. no pere . All other MSS om. no . The following reading may be taken as corroborative evidence: 7, 14. must . All other MSS except CC 1 13 have variations of mote . On the basis of the above readings, we may assume ex 2 a CC 2 , b , the significant readings of which, as they differ from those of a , are as follows: 11. That of yelownesse hath never no pere IV. H 2 and b share two unique readings. However, because of the following unique readings in b (where H 2 and the rest of the MSS agree), we cannot assume the descent b &gt; H 2 : 5. to be layde; H 2 be leyde 16. souerayne lady; H 2 saveoure 20. Reads line 6 here; H 2 But yitte I pray vn-to your courtesye 22ff. Om. envoy; H 2 has the envoy Nor, because of the following unique readings in H 2 (where b and the rest of the MSS agree), can we assume the descent b &lt; H 2 : 10. Or shew . . . to; b Or se (om. to ) 15. Yee pursse; b Now purse Note also this reading in H 2 : 16. as in pis worlde doune here . Although in reading downe in this world here b incorrectly omits as , it preserves the generally supported word-order. 14 H 2 and b share this unique reading: 13. Om. good . All other MSS read good . These readings are also significant: 11. H 2 neuer his pere; b neuer no pere . The extra word is uniquely common to these MSS. 18. Sith . All other texts except CC 1 and the Thynne print of 1532 read Syn . 15 On the basis of these readings we may assume ex 2 b H 2 , c , the significant readings of which, as they differ from those of b , are as follows: 5. be leyde 16. saveoure 20. But yitte I pray vn-to your courtesye 22ff. The envoy presumably read as in H 2 . V. Before considering the group A CC 1 Cx P, I shall give briefly the evidence for the classification of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth-century printed versions of the Purse . Since they all derive ultimately from Cx, they are of no value in establishing a text. 16 The descent often can be determined only through shared spellings since many of these texts are practically identical. The copy in Thynne's 1532 edition of The Workes (sig. Vvv4 b ) is almost identical with Cx: the only variations of importance are the substitution of arte for be in line 15, and Sithe for Syn in line 18. The copies in the 1542 and the undated (1545?) Thynne (sig. TT5 a and Qqq4 b respectively) are independently descended from the 1532 volume, as can be determined from the spellings which the undated Thynne shares with the 1532 but not with the 1542. The only variant reading of any importance is the undated Thynne's error tresour for tresorere in line 18. The copy in Stow's 1561 edition of The Workes (sig. O006 6 -Ppp1 a ), is descended from the copy in the undated Thynne edition, sharing with it tresoure but misreading worde for worlde , l. 16, and Burtes for Brutes , l. 22. The copy in Speght-s 1598 edition of The Workes (sig. O005 b -O006 a ) is descended from Stow: it leaves uncorrected the three misreadings mentioned above but introduces no new errors. The copy in Speght's 1602 edition (sig. Iii3 a ) "corrects" the errors of its predecessor ( treasoure becomes treasure , Burtes becomes Brutes , word becomes world ) but for some unknown reason attributes the poem to Hoccleve. This copy introduces a few slight variants (these are found also in its offsprings, a copy in a 1649 pamphlet reprinted and discussed by P. B. Mitchell in MLN , li [1936], 436, and the reprint in the 1687 Speght). The last text we need consider is the copy in Urry's 1721 The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, Compared with the Former Editions, and many valuable MSS (p. 549). Despite the pretensions of the book's title, this copy is only a sophisticated version of Stow. VI. CC 1 Cx P share one unique reading. Because CC 1 is a fragment, containing also a number of unique readings, neither Cx nor P can be descended from it: 1-14. CC 1 omits the first two stanzas. 16. as in this worde downe here; Cx P as doun in this world here , a reading which we must assume to be that of Chaucer's original. 17 17. Of lich 18 ; Cx P Out of , the reading of all other MSS. 18. tresour; Cx P tresorere , the reading of all other MSS. 19. shae; Cx P shaue , the reading of all other MSS. 20. you curtiously; Cx P your curtoisye , the reading of all other MSS. 24.

Om. yet; CC 1 P yet , the reading of all other MSS. Note also the following unique spelling in Cx: 19. ony; CC 1 P any , the usual spelling. CC 1 Cx P share one unique reading: 24. Om. song . All other MSS containing the envoy read song . Note these other readings as corroborative evidence: 5. Both P and Cx depart from the usual reading, upon my bere . P up on bere , Cx upon a bere . 8. yet . The rest of the MSS read it . Presumably, Cx and P's unusual spelling arose from a parent MS. whose parent, in turn, read yt. 25. CC 1 Cx P depart from the reading which we must assume to be that of x (see section X below), all oure harmes , CC 1 reading all my mys , Cx P all harmes . 20 On the basis of the above readings we may assume ex 2 CC 1 Cx P, d , the significant readings of which are as follows: 4. For certes but ye make me heuy chiere 5. Me were as lief be leid vpon bere 7, 14, 21. Be 8. yet 11. had neuer pere 13. of gode companye 16. as doun in this world here 18. Syn 19. as any frere 21. Be . . . mote I 24. Ben verrey kinge this to yow I sende 25. And ye that mow all harmes amende VII. A and d share two readings, one unique, the other, although not unique, believed to be significant for grouping A with d . Because, however, of the following unique readings in A (where d and the rest of the MSS agree), we cannot assume the descent d &lt; A: 4. any; d heuy 13. Om. of; d of 21. Om. mote; d mote 22ff. A omits the envoy Note these unique spellings in A: 7. dey; d dye , the usual spelling. 20. Rut (an obvious scribal error); d But . Nor, because of the following unique readings in d (where A agrees with the rest of the MSS), can we assume the descent d &gt; A: 5. upon bere; A upon my bere 8. yet; A hit A and d share these readings: 4. Om. if . All other MSS except CC 2 read if . 7, 14, 21. Be . All other MSS read some form of Beth . Although this evidence is not strong, it is stronger than any other evidence for placing A; hence I think we may assume ex 2 d A, e , the significant readings of which, as they differ from those of d , are as follows: 4. For certes but ye make me heuy chere 5. vpon my bere 8. hit VIII. Because of the following unique readings in c (where e agrees with the two MSS not yet considered, F and Ff), we cannot assume the descent e &lt; c: 11. had never no pere; e had neuer pere 13. Om. good; e good Nor, because of the following unique readings in e (where c agrees with F Ff), can we assume the descent e &gt; c : 4. Om. if; c if 24. Om. song; c song 25. Om. oure; c (with Ff) oure c and e share one reading which is not shared by the two MSS yet to be considered (F Ff): 19. For I am shave as nigh as any frere This line must be assumed to be the reading of the prototype. Otherwise we must assume, as will appear, that x read For I am shave as nye as is any frere (a reading found only in Ff). Hence we cannot consider that c and e had an exclusive common ancestor. Each rather represents a group derived independently from an unknown parent MS. IX. F and Ff share a number of unique readings. Because of these unique readings in Ff, however, we cannot assume the descent F &lt; Ff: 11. the lewdnesse; F yelownesse , the reading of c e . 19. Om. nye; F nye , the reading of c e . Note also these two spellings in Ff: 7, 14. deye; F dye , the usual spelling. 21. erlles; F elles , the usual spelling. Nor, because of these unique readings in F, can we assume the descent F &gt; Ff: 19. a; Ff any , the reading of c e . 25. alle myn harme; Ff all oure harmes , the reading of c . F and Ff share these unique readings: 18. bene . The other MSS read be . 19. is . The other MSS omit. 25. mowen . This form varies in all other copies. Note also these two unique spellings: 8. voucheth sauf . This phrase was troublesome to nearly all of the Purse scribes (A vouchesafe; A 2 H fouchesauf; CC 2 wouschsaf; Cx vouchesauf; H 2 wouchepe save; M fouchesaufe; P vouch sauf ). 14. ayeyne On the basis of the above readings we may assume ex 2 F Ff, f , the significant readings of which are as follows: 4. but yf 7, 14, 21. Beth 13. of gode companye 18. Syn 19. For I am shave as nye as is any frere 21 24. song 25. all oure harmes X. Neither c nor e can be descended from f because of f 's reading: 19. For I am shave as nye as is any frere . Here c and e agree on as nygh as any frere . XI. f shares with c these readings not found in e: 4. but if . e omits if 7, 14, 21. Beth e Be 24. song . e omits song 25. all oure harmes e all harmes But f shares with e these readings not found in c: 13. gode . c omits gode 18. Syn. c Sith 22 Hence we must suppose that c , e , and f all derive independently from one parent (the x of the tree). XII. From the tree it will be seen that four MSS (F Ff A H 2 ) are all at one remove from the original. Of these Ff has the fewest unique readings and is in general a good text. It therefore forms the basis of the text which I now print.

The differences are: 3. been . Skeat be . 4. ffor certes but yf ye make me hevy chere . Skeat and Robinson omit yf. 24 11. That of yelownesse had neuer pere . Skeat and Robinson read hadde . 15. ben. Skeat be . 18. wil. Skeat and Robinson wole . 25. all oure harmes . Skeat all our harm . Because the differences between my text and Skeat's and Robinson's, while numerous, are rather trivial, a natural question now—at least a question frequently asked—is this: If a text is to stay substantially the same, why go to the trouble of "establishing" it? 25 Is the work worth doing, really? An answer lies readily at hand in Dr. Bühler's comments on the Morgan MS.: Does line 17 in the Morgan MS. [ Oute of this toune helpe me pis night ] mean that Chaucer wanted money to leave Greenwich and thus avoid an expected encounter with the sheriff? . . . The lines (apart from the Envoy) suggest a date not later than May 4, 1398, for on that day King Richard took Chaucer "into his special protection. . . ." After that date Chaucer had no reason to press for money so urgently, or, for that matter, to leave town precipitously. This is true not only of the poem as it stands in the Morgan MS. but also in the other MSS.; the Morgan text (in line 17) mainly emphasizes Chaucer's immediate need of money. This argues for a date earlier than May 4th, 1398; in that case, the Morgan text may be construed to represent the earlier version of the poem. 26 Chaucer's biography is so meager that it is tempting to make any inferences we can. I think my study shows, however, that we must reject any inferences drawn from line 17 in the Morgan MS. From the evidence set forth in section 11 above, we must conclude that the Morgan MS. is the sister of Harley 2251—that the two manuscripts have an exclusive common ancestor, the a of my tree. From the evidence set forth in sections III and IV, we must conclude that b is the sister of CC 2 , 27 and that, in turn, the exclusive common ancestor of a and CC 2 (the b of my tree) is the sister of Harley 7333. Now in line 17 Harley 2251 and Harley 7333 read Out of this towne help me thurgh youre myght; this is the reading of the rest of the manuscripts also. Hence the reading of a , the parent of the Morgan MS., must have been thurgh youre myght , and the variant pis night the emendation of a scribe. TABLE OF VARIANTS Note .

Robinson: (1) A 2 CC 2 F Ff H H 2 ; (2) A Cx P. Bühler: (1) A CC 2 F Ff H 2 P: (2) A 2 H M. (See below for the meanings of the sigils.) Although the alphabetical arrangement of the sigils shows most imperfectly the many differences between these classifications, one will note the flexibility with which the MSS are shifted from group to group. Obviously at least two of these classifications must be largely incorrect. 5 Dr. Bühler's classification is based mainly on the variants in lines 5, 11, 16, and 20; Robinson's (a tentative classification) and Heath's are published almost without explanation. 6 Note that Robinson omits M and CC 1 (both unavailable to him); Bühler, Cx and CC 1 (the latter unavailable to him); and Heath (whose classification was published in 1898), A 2 CC 1 CC 2 M (some of the errors in Heath's classification probably arise from the small number of MSS which he used, but cf. Flügel, "Kritische Bemerkungen zur Globe-edition von Chaucers Werken," ESt , XXVII [1900], 60). CC 1 (a transcription of which is printed in my "Four Unpublished Chaucer MSS" [forthcoming in MLN ]) and the Black Letter texts had not been classified until my study. 7 Most of them have been published by the Chaucer Society (for A F Ff H H 2 P, see Parallel Texts , pp. 448-49; for A 2 , More Odd Texts , p. 41; for Cx, Supplementary Parallel Texts , p. 155), and I have relied on their transcriptions. In addition, I have used the transcription of M published by Dr. Bühler ( op. cit. , 6-7) and the transcription of CC 2 published by H. N. MacCracken ("An Odd Text of Chaucer's Purse ," MLN , XXVII [1912], 228-29). The MSS are all from the Fifteenth Century (Cx was printed ca. 1477); A and F are from the first half. Except for CC 1 , the dating of which is necessarily my own, I have relied on generally established dates. (Although questions of date are not important in the classification of the Purse MSS, I might point out that the MS. tree which I propose preserves chronological probability.) 8 "Two British Museum MSS," Anglia , XXVIII (1905), 1-28. The evidence which Miss Hammond used, however, is completely outside the Purse MSS. 9 Henceforth called " shared unique readings ." These readings are in A 2 , of course, but at the moment that fact is irrelevant (cf. fn. 10 below). 10 As a general thing, the phrase "the reading of the rest of the MSS" means exactly what it says. To avoid an unnecessary complication, however, I exclude from consideration the readings of MSS already considered provided they are in the same line of descent as the MS. being discussed . For instance, it is at present of no significance whether A 2 agrees or disagrees with the rest of the MSS. (The variant readings of A 2 —as well as those of the other MSS—may be found in the Table of Variants below.) 11 This useful abbreviation, borrowed from the Chicago Chaucer , means, of course, "the exclusive common ancestor [of H and M]." 12 On the basis of this reading Dr. Bühler groups CC 2 with A P (he does not consider Cx). The omission, however, is of the sort that any scribe might well be tempted to make, since the line is metrically too long and the yf is not necessary to the sense (see below for a further discussion of this variant). In view of the quite strong evidence in lines 5 and 11 for grouping CC 2 with a , one is practically forced to consider the omission of yf as accidental coincidence. 13 CC 1 , in the same book as CC 2 , contains the last stanza and the envoy. Although it is of a different provenance from CC 2 (see section VI), and apparently in a different hand, there may be some connection in both texts' reading must instead of mote . 14 CC 1 reads as in this worde downe here . The agreement in word-order with H 2 seems nonsignificant (see fn. 17 below). 15 Since the Thynne print is clearly copied from Cx (see section V below), which reads Syn , this reading may have little significance. 16 Fortunately, as they seem never to have been investigated carefully (even Thynne was unclassified before this study, although the classification is simple [cf. Robinson, op. cit. , p. 1039]). 17 The evidence for this line is as follows: Cx P A F Ff as doun in this world here CC 1 as in this worde downe here H 2 as in pis worlde doune here A 2 H downe in this world here M in this worlde here As we shall see, we must assume that F Ff form a group independently descended from x; hence we must assume the reading of Cx P A to be that of x (note also the reading of A 2 H). CC 1 's reading, however, leaves us with two additional problems: the agreement in word-order with H 2 and the agreement in the variant worde with the Stow print. For the first of these I can offer no explanation except to remark on the general badness of CC 1 's text, a badness which suggests memorial transcription. I am forced to regard the agreement in word-order with H 2 as accidental in view of the rather strong evidence for grouping CC 1 with Cx P in l. 24. The second agreement is even more remarkable when considered with the next line, for there CC 1 reads tresour with Stow. Yet we know that Stow's reading derives from the 1545(?) Thynne. It is chronologically impossible, of course, that CC 1 be descended from Thynne or Stow, and there seems to be no reason for thinking that Thynne or Stow utilized CC 1 , since their texts are otherwise in close agreement with their printed predecessors. The explanation must lie in the character of the variants. Both tresour and worde make a sort of obvious sense, and hence both may be sophistications; or they may be misprints in Thynne and Stow, graphic errors in CC 1 (note that CC 1 's scribe drops a letter in shave , l. 19, reading shae ). (Professor Hench has called my attention, since I wrote this note, to the fact that word is commonly found for world in Middle English texts (cf. NED ). Hence the form in CC 1 is quite probably only a variant spelling.) Such striking agreements as the tresourworde pair show how necessary it is to consider all variant readings in constructing a tree rather than simply those that seem significant. 18 Apparently meaningless (the writing is clear). 19 The omission of yf must be considered non-significant for grouping CC 2 with A P in view of the evidence set forth in section III. 20 CC 1 's reading perhaps derives from a spelling all har mys , since in the non-book hands of the period har and my do not look unlike. 21 F For I am shave as nye as is a ffrere; Ff For I am shaue as ys any frere . 22 To be considered as significant only with the reservation expressed in fn. 15 above. 23 There are many differences in spelling, of course; but since no edition can pretend to reproduce Chaucer's spelling, the fact that the three texts are spelt somewhat differently is not important. My procedure has been to follow F's spelling rather rigidly, departing from it only when it is unique (but making no distinction between y and i and u and v: hence sovne instead of soune in l. 9). Skeat's departures from F's spelling, incidentally, seem to follow no consistent plan: for instance, he adopts the spelling of Cx P, purs , in l. 15, although the spelling of F, purse , is found also in A A 2 [CC 1 ] H [M]; but in l. 1 he retains F's purse , although Cx Ff P spell the word purs . Skeat's through for thurgh , l. 17, is found in no MS. 24 My reading, metrically less regular than Skeat's and Robinson's, perhaps needs a word of comment. Although yf is omitted by some MSS (A CC 2 Cx P), it is found in two of the three branches of the tree and hence must be assumed to have been in the original. Furthermore, it would seem more probable that a scribe would emend to make the line more regular than emend to make it less regular. (It may be well to remind the reader that the x of the tree is only the archetype of the eleven Purse MSS; that it is not necessarily identical with Chaucer's own copy of his poem [indeed, most probably is not exactly identical]; and hence that the x of the tree may itself have contained errors.) 25 One can never know, of course, what the final text will be until the work is done. 26 Op. cit. , pp. 8-9. Since Dr. Bühler is arguing from a unique reading—and the assumption is usually made that unique readings are per force to be regarded as of scribal origin—, the reader should know that in Dr. Bühler's tree the Morgan MS. is placed at one remove from the original. Even so, there are logical difficulties in assuming "the earlier version." Instead of one earlier version, at least two earlier versions must be assumed, one composed of the Morgan MS. alone (solely on the basis of its unique variant in l. 17). 27 CC 2 ends at line 14.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Headlines of William de Machlinia's Year-Book, 37 Henry VI by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RECENT REVOLUTIONARY STUDIES in the field of headlines by Bowers, 1 McManaway, Hinman and others among my colleagues have suggested to me that I might try my prentice hand at this line of investigation. For this trial effort, I chose an English incunabulum in the Pierpont Morgan Library 2 which might prove valuable from a bibliographical point of view even if, for the literary student, the book is singularly lacking in appeal. The results of my study are set forth below; they are interesting though, perhaps, inconclusive—the latter being the possible result of my inexperience in this form of bibliographical research. The volume under examination is the Year-Book 37 Henry VI credited to the press of William de Machlinia in London and apparently printed between 1486 and 1490. The collation of the volume, as given by Duff 422, 3 is: [a 8-1 ] b-f 8 g h 6 . The information as to the first quire is somewhat uninformative. Upon careful study it becomes evident that folio 3 is an insert as it is printed on different paper from the rest of the quire; the watermarks and the stub found between folios 5 and 6 of the Morgan and Exeter College copies confirm this. Apparently this leaf was forgotten or overlooked when the quire went to press and the omission was made good by an insert. According to Dr. Greg's formulary, the first quire would be described as a 6 (a2+1). For reasons which I set forth in my Rosenbach lecture (1947), I should prefer to describe this as [a 7 ; a3 disjunct) or, as expressed in M. Polain's 4 form, [a 7 (4+3, le 3 e encarté)]. Before turning to the volume itself, a word may be said about the headlines in such fifteenth-century books as the present example. It is, of course, a commonplace observation that early type was often somewhat crudely cut and easily subject to damage; frequently the ink was carelessly applied and, being thin, tended to spread and distort the face of the type. This at once simplifies and complicates the examination of the headlines. While the variety of tied letters in the earlier fonts makes it easy to sort out the headlines into readily identifiable groups, the indistinct characters and bad inking make it extremely difficult, on occasion, to determine whether a specific headline on one page is the same as that on another or whether the apparent identity is just an instance of a headline reset with the identical combination of tied letters and reasonably comparable spacing. The headlines in the present volume have been minutely examined as to letter-press, and calliper measurements of over-all length and spacings have been carefully recorded; 5 for the purposes of this discussion, only those running heads will be admitted which can, with reasonable certainty, be assumed to be identical. One peculiarity of the headlines in this book must be pointed out at once, since it is of special significance. In normal circumstances (and especially in books of a later date), a particular headline, when it forms part of a permanent skeleton, 6 must necessarily always be in the same position 7 relative to the edges of the type-page. In this Year-Book , however, the position of a specific headline is not so invariable. For example, in quire b the eight verso running-heads show five (possibly more) different positions relative to the (printed) left-hand edge of the type-page, the maximum difference being as much as 13 millimetres. Dr. Fredson Bowers has kindly suggested to me what is surely the only reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. It is possible that the long lines of the folio volume made it difficult for the pressman to pick up a whole line of type (that is, the headline with its letter-press and quads) without danger of pieing. Thus one may assume, in this case, that in transferring the parts of a skeleton from one forme to assemble them again around the type-pages of the next one, the printer merely picked up the letter-press of the headline, centered it (as nearly as he could judge) to the text-page and filled up the rest of this line to the edge of the type-page with the loose quads from the forme about to be distributed. This would adequately explain the variations in the position of the headline from page to page. Turning now to the actual headlines in Machlinia's Year-Book , we find that, with three exceptions, 8 each recto page contains the words "Henrici sexti." The versos usually indicate the four terms of court (Michaelmas, Hilary, Easter and Trinity). The recto headlines are extant in at least three different settings that can easily be spotted: (1). Thorned H; ri tied (2). Thorned H; ri separate letters (3). Unthorned H; ri tied As the investigation will at this stage be simplified by confining our study to the last three gatherings (f-h), it will be seen that the verso headlines cover the Trinity term (Trin xxxvij) and appear in four different settings: (a). ri tied; j undotted; 5 mm. space; 30 mm. over-all 9 (b). ri tied; j dotted; 3 mm. space; 28 mm. over-all (c). ri tied; j dotted; 1 mm. space; 26 mm. over-all (d). ri separate; j undotted; 30 mm. over-all Now the outer formes of quire f regularly have the combination: Trinity (c)—Henry (1); the inner formes, however, have with the same regularity: Trinity (a)—Henry (3). In the case of gathering g. both inner and outer formes have the headlines: Trinity (b)—Henry (1). The headlines of quire h are decidedly more complicated. The first two sheets (h1.6 and h2.5) have in both formes: 10 Trinity (d)—Henry (3); but the inner and outer formes of the innermost (h3.4) both have: Trinity (b)—Henry (1). The result then is this: in gathering f, Machlinia had and used two skeletons, one for the outer forme and the other for the inner; in quire g he used but one skeleton (a variant of that found in $(0) of f); and, for quire h, he employed for the outer two sheets a variant of the skeleton used in the inner forme of f. Since the innermost sheet of h is printed with the same running heads as quire g, it probably indicates that when Machlinia had set his type through folio 4 recto, he was ready to print the inner forme of the innermost sheet and proceeded to do so with the skeleton that had just been used for printing the last forme of g (whichever one that may have been). 11 While this sheet was printing, Machlinia put in a new head, i.e. Trinity (d), for the skeleton used for the inner forme of f in order to print the middle sheet of h as well as the inner forme of the outer sheet; the recto headline also appears on h1. Turning now to the earlier gatherings, we find that the headlines for quire c are perplexing but afford information of a rather speculative sort. Here are found on the versos three forms for the headline for Hilary term: (α). Hill' xxxvij—c4, c5 and c6 (β). Hillarij xxxvij—c8 (and d1) (γ). Hillarij xxxiiij ( sic )—c2 and c7 A study of the sheets in their bound and quired form (not that of production) supplies the following information. The skeleton for the previous printed forme (be that either forme of the outer sheet of gathering b) contained the headline "Michīs xxxvij—Henry (2)" and this reappears in the first inner forme of c (c1 v -c8). For the outer forme, and for all the other versos (save c3), Machlinia required a new running title for Hilary term. Thus he here used Hilary (β) for c8 v and, for c1, Henry (1). This latter heading had been previously employed for the printing of the rectos of b6 and [a3-5]. For the next sheet (c2-c7), Machlinia used another headline. The skeleton then contained, for the outer forme, the incorrect Hilary (γ) 12 and Henry (1). This same skeleton was employed for the inner forme, with the result that the Hilary (γ) headline on c2 v was then wrong in two respects since, instead of Michaelmas 37, it read Hilary 34. In the case of the third and fourth sheets of signature c, 13 Machlinia was obliged to meet a rather complex situation, for whereas the outer forme of the former and the inner of the latter had the same headline, the complementary formes did not. For the formes with the identical headline, 14 he used a running title reading Hilary (α)—Henry (2); this corrects the error of Hilary (γ) of the second sheet. Beginning with the outer sheet, the headlines may be summarized thus: Quire c 1.8(o): Henry (1)—Hilary (β) (i): Henry (2)—Michīs xxxvij 2.7(o.i): Henry (1)—Hilary (γ) 3.6(o): Henry (2)—Hilary (α) (i): Henry (2)—Michīs xxxvij H vi 15 4.5(o): De t'mino 16 &amp;c—Hilary (α) (i): Henry (2)—Hilary (α) The actual printing of the eight leaves of gathering c may well have proceeded as follows. When the compositor had set through folio 5 r , printing on this section could have begun. In moving the skeleton from the last forme of b and requiring a new headline for c4 v -c5, the printer placed the still usable running title (Michīs xxxvij) above the type-page of c1 v and supplied the new head Henry (2)—Hilary (α). For the outer forme of c3.6 he could (and perhaps did) use the same skeleton and headline immediately 17 —and he could then have perfected both sheets by using the respective halves of the original headline together with the special running titles as noted above. At this stage the original pair of running titles was no longer together, so the compositor set up the combination Henry (1)—Hilary (γ) for c2.7 (probably using a skeleton then idle) and printed both outer and inner formes with this. The skeleton for inner c3.6 could then have been used for printing inner c1.8, keeping Henry (2) and using the Michīs xxxvij which had been preserved for this purpose. For the outer forme of this sheet, the printer then had available the skeleton of c2.7; he retained the Henry (1) but, noting the misprint, supplied the correct Hilary (β) for c8 v . These are the facts, so far as they can be ascertained with any reasonable assurance, which may be determined from the headlines—though the reader, without the book before him, is possibly by this time thoroughly confused. If my findings are correct, it would indicate that expediency was the order of the day at Machlinia's press. 18 It seems likely that the printing of the various formes for this book was undertaken rather with the idea of conserving effort than that of saving time or maintaining a logical sequence. As we have seen, Machlinia was perfectly capable (in gathering f) of handling two skeletons, printing the one forme with one skeleton and perfecting with the other. Why he did not follow the same procedure in quire g is incomprehensible to me, unless it be true that another press with a less skilled crew was set to work on this section of the book. Again, in quires c and h, Machlinia used more than one skeleton but (in all of h and in parts of c) he printed the inner and outer formes of the same sheet with the same skeleton. He thereby voided whatever benefits normally accrue through the use of multiple skeletons, especially those of keeping the press at full productivity and saving time. Machlinia may, of course, have found difficulty in keeping the text pages of troublesome Law-French in proper order (he had already made one serious slip in the first quire). This may have suggested to him that it would be better to proceed with caution rather than to avail himself of the full potential productivity of the press. If there is any other explanation for the curious order in which the headlines appear in quires c and h, it is not apparent to me.</field>

The headlines are relatively short and the effect of shrinkage would not be perceptible in millimetre measurements below a maximum 33 mm. for the longest normal headline. 6 For the definition of this term, see Fredson Bowers, "The Headline in Early Books," English Institute Annual, 1941 (1942), p. 186, and his general discussion of the problem in "Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence," The Library , 4th ser., XIX, 315-338. 7 Very minor variations in the position of the headline may, of course, be due to the difference in the amount of pressure when the headline was locked but such a change would necessarily be quite small. 8 On the first printed page [a2], c4 (see below) and d3, the beginning of Easter term. 9 The measurement is taken from the left extremity of the cross-bar in T to the point at the bottom tip of j . 10 h6 verso is, of course, blank. 11 If one should assume that Machlinia began printing with the first sheet of quire h—printing both formes of this and the second sheet with only one skeleton, there is no apparent reason why he should have preserved the skeleton from the previous quire for use only in both formes of the innermost sheet. If he had been printing "outside in", one would expect to find the same skeleton used for all three sheets, or (if he here used two skeletons) to find the second skeleton used for the second sheet. 12 This, naturally, would be a suitable headline for Duff 419 ( Year-Book 34 Henry VI ). Through the courtesy of Mr. H. G. Nicholas, Librarian of Exeter College, Oxford, I learn that the section for Hilary term 34 Henry VI occurs on signatures f2 through h3 of Duff 419. This slight misprint perhaps means that the two books were printed about the same time. 13 In quire d, the situation is equally complex. For the first sheet of this quire, Machlinia seems to have taken, from the skeleton of c1-c8 v , Hilary (β) for the inner forme as it reappears (just once again) on d1 v and Henry (1) for the outer, since this reading is found only on d1 and was not used again till quire f. The innermost sheet, in turn, has the same headline in both formes: Pasche xxxvij ( j undotted)—Henry (3); the latter appears here for the first time. This combination of running titles occurs only once more, in the outer forme of the second sheet of gathering e. In the rest of quires d and e, the only recto headline is Henry (2); the verso running-heads seem to defy classification. 14 One must otherwise assume that separate headlines were supplied for all four formes, since (as we shall see) parts of the original pair of running titles appear in the complementary formes. But these running titles seem to be identical and it seems mathematically most improbable that Machlinia could four times have set such headlines with the same combination of abbreviations, spacings and measurements. This is especially true in view of the noticeable variety found elsewhere whenever he was called upon to supply new letter-press. It is true that the headline on c6 verso seems to measure one millimetre more than the others but it is possible that this particular forme was not locked up as tightly as the other two. The measurements for the Trinity headline, it should be noted, depend on the space between the term and the year—a somewhat different matter than simple over-all length. Even a slight loosening of the pressure would probably spread the increased length more or less equitably throughout the running title, not necessarily in just one particular place. 15 This marks the end of the Michaelmas term. 16 The headline "De t'mino hill' anno H sexti.xxxvij." is supplied to mark the opening of the Hilary term. 17 If he had printed normally (that is, first the inner and then the outer formes of c4.5 and c3.6), he would have had available (from outer c3.6) the pair "Henry (2)—Hilary (α)" for printing outer c1.8. Since, however, he set up new combinations for both c1.8 v and c2.7, it seems to indicate that the old pair of headlines was no longer available. 18 Charlton Hinman ("New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual, 1941 , pp. 207-222) has suggested that, when two skeletons were employed, this was done solely for the purpose of speeding up the presswork. He also states (p. 209): "It follows as a general principle that in any book printed on a single press two sets of headlines will appear only if the book was printed in an edition large enough for composition to keep ahead of presswork—and of presswork at the increased speed which the use of two skeletons would make possible." Neither of these conditions necessarily applies here, but it must be borne in mind that Machlinia was working, almost certainly with rather simple equipment, more than a century earlier than the period with which Hinman concerns himself.

      <field name="heading_text">Sir John Davies' Nosce Teipsum , 1599: A Bibliographical Puzzle by Gerald J. Eberle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FULL STORY OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES of Nosce Teipsum , 1599, a quarto, has by no means been told. I propose to add a chapter, analyzing and identifying the twenty copies I have examined or have had examined for me. Of these copies of STC 6355, all printed by Richard Field for John Standish in 1599, eleven are usually described as first editions, nine as second. Some libraries have made a further distinction between a first and second issue of the first edition, based upon variant readings in line sixteen of signature C1 v . The reading "chaunge" has been used to distinguish the first issue, the second issue having "chaunce" at this point. These editions and issues, however, are linked by more than their common imprint. In signatures K and L, for example, the first and second editions are being printed very nearly at the same time. Standing type from the first edition, signatures K4 and L3, is used with the new running-title in the second edition. More significantly, in two copies of the second edition —one in the Chapin Library of Williams College, the other in the Folger Shakespeare Library, the copy identified as STC 6355b—outer K of the second edition is perfected with corrected inner K from the first edition. Apparently this perfecting was stopped early; the perfecting of outer K in other copies of the second edition was continued with only one page of standing type. Because this linking of editions is but a small part of the central problem, I have not attempted to examine all available copies of the second edition. Nor have I reported in the charts five copies which appear to be normal second editions throughout. Those unreported copies are in the Rylands Library, Manchester; Emmanuel College Library, Cambridge; the Henry E. Huntington Library; Yale University Library; and the Detroit Public Library. A more significant link between the first and second editions is to be seen in three copies: the Chapin Library copy, the Library of Congress copy, and the Bodleian copy. These three are usually identified as second editions, but all three have signatures B and C from the first edition. I doubt that these are made-up copies in the usual sense of the word. These links are charted in the accompanying Table I, the full meaning of which will become apparent as this report progresses. At the moment a brief word of explanation is in order: I have used the symbol X for the first edition and Y for the second. The appended u and c indicate the uncorrected and corrected states of a forme, the combined uc indicates a partially corrected forme. The X1 and X2 indicate the first and second settings of type in outer B and C, about which more later. The absence of an appended symbol does not necessarily indicate an invariant forme but merely that I have not recorded any corrections. The gaps in the chart call attention to those copies which have not been studied fully, because I found it necessary to have them examined for me. Those fully reported I have studied either in the originals or in photostats. As is apparent from the chart, the linking of editions is just one of several abnormalities that resulted from the complicated printing of Nosce Teipsum . That several formes appear in two settings of type has been long known, but not explained. I propose here to report fully what I have found and to attempt an explanation. Though the creaking of the machinery while the guns are hauled into position might prove somewhat annoying, several more charts must be displayed and explained: the accompanying Table II indicates the distribution of running-titles in all formes of the first edition. The apparently arbitrary choice of letters to designate running-titles was a device to facilitate recognition. Each symbol indicates the letter in the running-title which is its most obvious distinguishing mark. Thus the so-called U running-title is that in which the U and M are badly spaced. It will be noted immediately that after sheet G the arrangement of these heads in sets of four is slightly varied. The earlier grouping has heads S U T E in one unit and O I N P in another. By way of warning it must be noted here that in the rearrangement of heads after sheet G, the bad spacing of the U head was remedied. But close examination leads me to believe that it is the same head, not a new one. In passing I might add that the running-titles of Nosce Teipsum are somewhat hard to manage because they are all upper-case letters and do not show many marks of positive identification. Only the simultaneous examination of many copies made it possible for me to ignore minor variations due to faulty inking or dirty type. Table III is involved in the distinction between the first and second settings of type in outer B and outer C, and generally in the relationship between the first and second editions. It charts an odd practice by one of the compositors in Field's shop, the man who set the type for almost all of the second edition and part of the first; this compositor habitually placed a space in front of each mark of final punctuation. The formes in both editions which are set by this compositor are marked W , the unspaced-punctuation formes are marked N . The chart refers to the first setting of type in the first edition, and momentarily ignores a slight exception which will be discussed in detail later. The forme that I have listed as B(0)X2, the reset, is unusual in that the so-called wide-spaced final punctuation appears on B2 v and B3, and the unspaced or narrow punctuation on B1 and B4 v . This abnormality obviously suggests a resetting by two compositors, each working from half a sheet already printed on one side. No other conceivable explanation is as satisfying as this one; hence I have not hesitated to label the second setting positively. This reset of outer B is superior to the original setting in several important readings, and includes on B4 v the use of italic instead of roman type in lines 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 15. Ordinarily we expect reset pages to be inferior to the original setting in appearance at least. 1 But here the evidence of two compositors at work, each on a half sheet, is, I think, decisive. Such a division of copy is expedient when the press is standing by, waiting for a forme which had been mistakenly distributed too soon. Because the reset in B(o) is marked by improvements in readings and by the substitution of italic for roman, a needed correction, the same touchstones ought to be valid in C(o). In outer C the reset forme substitutes italic for roman in nineteen words or phrases; it adds twenty commas; it improves seven readings, adds one typographical error and rectifies another. This analysis is re-inforced especially by one faulty reading in the first setting: "Aƈt" for "Art" on sig. C3. There can be no question that the correct reading is "Art". A compositor setting from manuscript could misread and set "Aƈt". But it is unlikely that he should set "Aƈt", using the ligature, from a printed page reading "Art". The more likely explanation is that he was resetting from corrected copy that consisted of the printed word "Aƈt" with marginal proof corrections to indicate the proper reading. When we turn to examination of the combinations of formes in B and C, we note several oddities. In sheet B, for example, all copies of the uncorrected state of the inner forme are perfected by the first setting of type, and all copies of the corrected state by the second setting. In inner B the corrected state is marked by these readings: Sig. B1 v , line 14 Good and Truth Sig. B2, line 4 retain'd Sig. B4, line 4 threat The uncorrected readings are " God and Truth ", "retained", "thereat". Only the last is a manifest error, though all the corrected readings are somewhat superior to the uncorrected. 2 The corrected state of inner C (not a new setting of type at all) is distinguished by the readings "chaunce" and "Doctrines". As is noted in Table I, the wholly uncorrected state of C(i) in the first edition, with the reading "chaunge" on sig. C1 v line 16, and the reading "Doctrine" on sig. C2 line 6, has been found in only one copy, the so-called first issue of the first edition in the Huntington Library. Four copies retain "chaunge" but correct to "Doctrines". The remaining copies make the further correction to "chaunce". Quite the opposite of what we found in sheet B, the five uncorrected and partially corrected formes of inner C are perfected by the second setting of type. One additional copy, that in the Carl Pforzheimer Library, perfects the corrected state of inner C with the second setting. All other copies have corrected inner C perfected by the first setting of type. The central question, as I take it, is this: How could a miscalculation go unnoticed until two successive outer formes had been printed and their type distributed? The notion that the formes had pied may be discounted immediately, for the running-titles were not disturbed. Any explanation must, I believe, take into account the odd order of perfecting in sheets B and C, as well as the apparent over-printing of these sheets that manifests itself in the three copies of the second edition which have sheets B and C from the first edition. It seems to me that we must assume, first of all, that the outer formes of sheets B and C were printed successively or perhaps simultaneously before perfecting was begun. Putting together all the evidence of running-titles, variants, and oddities, and making use of traceable broken letters, I offer one possible solution of the problem. In the following tentative explanation of what perhaps happened in Field's shop, the number of copies printed is, of course, pure conjecture, however reasonable the figures might appear to be. Because the time element is so important at the start at least, I have numbered the various steps in the process. 3 1. Forme B(o)X1 [S E T] and Forme C(o)X1 [O P N] were first imposed and run off. After about 800 copies had been machined, the type was distributed. It is possible that two presses worked off these formes simultaneously, and in view of what happened later it is perhaps probable. 2. Forme B(i)Xu [S U T E] perfected the 800 copies of Forme B(o)X1 [S E T]. Here in sig. B3 v line 8 appears for the first time a distinctively broken lower-case roman letter g in the word "sight". At this point it was decided to enlarge the edition to about 1400 copies. The decision was reached before the perfecting of sheet C was begun. 3. For some reason Forme C(i)Xu [O I N P] started to print white paper before perfecting C(o)X1. After about 100 copies had been printed, the first correction was made. After about 400 copies of C(i)Xuc [O I N P], the second correction was made. The final 100 copies on white paper were printed from C(i)Xc [O I N P]. Then the now wholly-corrected Forme C(i)Xc [O I N P] went on to perfect the 800 copies of C(o)X1. 4. Meanwhile Forme B(i)Xu [S U T E] had finished perfecting and had gone on to print 600 copies on white paper, but the forme had in the meantime undergone correction. Thus we have 600 white paper copies of B(i)Xc [S U T E]. 5. The resetting of already distributed type occurred here. Forme B(o)X2 [O P N] used the ornament that had been used in Forme B(o)X1 and some of the display type from the head-title: for example, the g from the word " knowledge ", but not the l . This Forme B(o)X2 [O P N] perfected the 600 copies of B(i)Xc [S U T E]. 6. In Forme C(o)X2 [O P N] the previously mentioned wide-spacing compositor assisted, setting sigs. C2 v and C3. Here, on sig. C1, the oddly broken letter g re-appears. 7. The 600 copies of Forme C(i)Xu-Xuc-Xc were perfected by Forme C(o)X2 [O P N]. And that completed the printing of all of sheets B and C for the first edition. At this point it was decided to enlarge the edition further, to perhaps 2400 copies, by making of it a double edition. The composition for what we call the second edition could have started at about the same time as step number 5 above, but not very well earlier. I believe that the wide-spacing compositor began to set Forme B(o) for the second edition as soon as he had completed his two pages for B(o)X2, for these reasons: For sig. B1 of the second edition he used some of the remaining letters of display type from the head-title of Forme B(o)X1: for example, the l from the word " knowledge " and the e from the word " humane ". The ornament used is a mirror image of that used in both settings of the first edition. Thus the re-appearance of certain letters and non-appearance of others gives us probable temporal termini within which the composition of the second edition may have begun. I assume that composition began after B(o)X1 was distributed and before B(o)X2 was completed. The decision to enlarge again, when the last of 1400 copies of sheets B and C were in process of being machined, made it advisable to print only 1000 copies of those sheets in the second edition. Thereafter each edition would print 1200 copies. The odd distribution of running-titles in the first edition can be reasonably accounted for if we assume that one press printed one forme each day. While the first edition machined sheet D, the second edition was working with sheet C. The distinctively broken letter g appears now in both C(o) and C(i) in the second edition. Obviously the type from C(o)X2 was distributed by the wide-spacing compositor in order to replenish a case that must have been quite short of certain sorts; so short, in fact, that it became expedient to distribute one of the formes in sheet C in the second edition before composition for the other forme was well under way. This unusual state of affairs came about probably because the second edition was being set by formes from proof-read sheets of the first edition as they came off the press. Had this delay between inner and outer formes of a single sheet occurred at the end of a working day, no special inconvenience would have resulted. From this point on, it seems likely that the second edition was composed by formes from the first edition and printed at the same time as the first edition but slightly more than one forme behind. Tracing the broken g through the formes enables us to see some such pattern. The broken g, last used in both formes of sheet C in the second edition, appears nowhere in sheet D. But it occurs in the first edition in sig. E3 v line 14, and in sig. F2 line 8. Then it appears again in the second edition, in G1 v line 4. Then back to the first edition in H3 line 6 and in I3 v line 13. It seems reasonably certain that the second edition was at least one forme behind the first edition but probably not much more than two formes behind. After sig. I3 v the distinctively broken g disappears. Fortunately, other links become apparent. It is noted in Table III that the wide-spacing compositor set both formes of sheet H, the inner forme of sheet I, and both formes of sheets K and L in the first edition; his hand is also traceable in the second edition in all formes except inner and outer F, inner and outer I, and outer L. This suggests the switching of compositors wherever the pressure was greatest at the moment. I think, too, that after the second edition had machined inner I, all the resources of the shop were directed toward completing the printing of the first edition. Some evidence is available to enable us to determine the time relationship in sheets K and following in the first edition. We note, for instance, that Forme K(i)Xc was used to perfect the first printed sheets of Forme K(o) in the second edition. The fact that the entire forme was used, running-titles and all, is significant, especially when we note that the relative position of those running-titles on the page is different in the second edition. Then, when the inner forme of K in the second edition was imposed, it used standing type from Forme K(i)Xc on sig. K4 v but with a single italic word in the first line set in different type. Apparently the use of the first edition forme in the second edition took place after that forme was unlocked. Now when we note that the running-titles used in K(i)Xc were used also in L(i)X we may assume that, unless the printing of sheet L in the first edition was delayed, the use of K(i)Xc to perfect K(o) of the second edition took place after the printing of the first edition was completed. In other words, the I T U S running-titles were re-imposed around the still standing pages of K(i)Xc for use in the second edition after they had been used for L(i)X. This explanation can be re-inforced by means of a further link between the two editions a bit earlier. When sig. M1 in the first edition, a single page, was printed along with the preliminary matter, 4 only one running-title was needed. The title used was the one identified in Table II as P. Another running-title in the same O E N P group, the O title, for which there was no longer any use in the first edition, appears now on sig. I3 in the second edition. I have not been able to trace any other of the first edition running-titles in the second edition. As a final link, the display type from the first edition title-page and from sig. A3 was re-used in the second edition but with a different ornament, again a mirror image of that which was used in the first edition. That the second edition was printed after the first here is determinable by the progressive deterioration of the central stem in the letter m in the word "Humane" on the title-page. The letter is damaged throughout the first edition copies and through part of the second edition copies. In some copies of the second edition the piece is broken off completely. In general, it seems clear that the outer forme of sheet I in the second edition was imposed while the press was machining the final formes of the first edition. To sum up: in the outer forme of sheet I of the second edition one running-title from the first edition was used. 5 In the inner forme of sheet K an entire forme was used for some of the perfecting of the second edition. Then a single page of standing type from the inner forme of sheet K in the first edition was used with a new running-title in the newly set inner forme of sheet K in the second edition. This must have been a time-consuming process, but no simpler explanation suggests itself. The possible overprinting of the inner forme of sheet K in the first edition would not account for the different position of headlines in the normal Forme K(i)Xc and in those pages as they appear in the second edition sheets. Similarly, in sheet L a single page of standing type from the first edition was used on sig. L3 with a new running-title and with reset marginal notes in the second edition. Furthermore, two compositors are at work on the final sheets of the second edition: the inner forme of sheet L is wide-spaced before final punctuation except for the first two lines of sig. L1 v ; the outer forme of sheet L is narrow-spaced except for sig. L3, where the wide spacing results from the fact that this is standing type from the wide-spaced first edition. In passing it might be noted that all the evidence that the second edition was set from the first is borne out by careful collation of variant readings. I make a special point of this since we might be tempted to assume that sheet I in the first edition was set from already printed formes of sheet I from the second edition, because of the odd division of labor between compositors. But I believe that the use of the O running-title on sig. I3 precludes this. Apparently we must assume a division of copy designed to allow each compositor to set a complete forme. Finally, the fact that the variant reading on sig. K3v— " will " for "will"—represents a miscorrection in the first edition that was repeated in the second must not disturb our belief that the second edition was in every forme set from the first. The complicated order of formes through the press in sheets B and C of the first edition, as outlined above, would result in the following combinations of variants: It is unfortunate that the wide distribution of copies of the first edition makes so difficult the examination of watermarks and paper. Otherwise it might be interesting to see whether such a study would confirm or render untenable the beliefs expressed here. Copies reported in numbered columns: 1.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford, 1928), pp. 184-6. 2 Because the second edition was set from uncorrected copy, it corrects the obvious error to "threat", but retains the faulty " God ". 3 The symbols used in Tables I and II have been used throughout the discussion that follows. The running-titles used for each forme are placed in square brackets after the identification of formes. Thus the symbol B(o)X1 [S E T] means "outer B of the first setting of type of the first edition with the running-titles identified as S E T ." 4 Note that sig. A in Table I is not simply divided into inner and outer formes. The unsigned title-page has its verso blank; the next leaf, signed A3, begins the dedicatory verses that end on the verso. Signature M1 was probably printed with the preliminaries. All known copies lack A1 and A4. The M1 page from the first edition in one copy of the second is probably the result of sophistication. 5 The running-titles in the second edition present a hopeless picture of lack of order. I find at least fourteen different titles, some used as many as seven times; is this evidence of a pool of running-titles?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Uses of Watermarks As Bibliographical Evidence by Allan H. Stevenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ONE ECONOMY practised in the publishing of cheap play quartos was the use of job lots of paper. These papers usually originated in France and varied somewhat in thickness, texture, and watermarks. As a result of their use, many quartos contain several different watermarks, and some almost as many different watermarks as sheets. 1 Often individual sheets vary in watermarks from copy to copy. It is obvious that such varying watermarks may prove a source of information as to the manner in which a book went through the press. Despite inherent ambiguities, they promise support to the evidence supplied by press corrections, headlines, and the early treatise by Joseph Moxon toward the solution of bibliographical problems. This article is intended as a preliminary enquiry into the significance of job-lot or variant watermarks. The evidence and illustrations are drawn mainly from a group of play-quartos printed by Thomas Cotes in the spring of 1639/40. Though studies of the papers of other printers are needed for correlation, the present investigation appears already to yield useful inferences and methods. The examination of watermarks is no easy task. The microfilm facilitates the collation of typographical variants from all over the world, but seldom suggests the presence of even a blatant watermark. If the bibliographer wishes to compare the paper in a number of copies, he must examine them at Bodley, Folger, and Huntington, or wherever they may be; and exact comparison suggests the advantage of carrying his own copy about as a basis of reference. Often it may not be possible to draw clear inferences from fewer than five or ten copies. In quartos the watermarks occur within the fold at the spine, and may be further obscured by sewing and close binding. When small they may be difficult to make out at all; and even when they are large and sprawling they may be difficult to describe well enough for sure recognition when one meets them again. 2 The initials on pots, the quarterings on shields, or the number of grapes on a stem may be hard to decipher. However, many watermarks are sufficiently distinguishable without such details. Gradually as one works from copy to copy the patterns of watermarks in an edition emerge and take on an appearance of significance. The most interesting set of job-lot watermarks that I have encountered occurs in a group of seven play quartos printed by Thomas Cotes (successor to the Jaggards) in or about February-March-April 1639/40. They consist of two plays of Fletcher, Wit without Money (1639) and The Night-Walker (1640), printed for Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, and five of Shirley, two, The Maides Revenge (1639) and The Humorous Courtier (1640), printed for Cooke alone, two, The Coronation and The Opportunitie (both 1640), printed for Crooke and Cooke, and one, Loves Crueltie (1640), printed for Crooke alone. 3 I began the study of their watermarks to learn what support they offered a hypothesis concerning the order in which these plays were printed. I found that the sequence of the watermarks substantiated my idea of the typographical relations of the title-pages. 4 Thus encouraged, I proceeded to look for further meaning in the watermarks. I noted that Cotes printed two other plays in 1640: Chamberlain's The Swaggering Damsell , for Andrew Crooke, and Habington's The Queene of Arragon , for William Cooke. The first is a quarto containing seven of the watermarks found in the Fletcher-Shirley group, and The Queene of Arragon is a small folio which luckily exhibits three (at least) of the same watermarks —in the center of the page. As these two plays were entered on 2 April 1640, 5 while Cotes was seeing the Fletcher-Shirley quartos through the press, it is likely that he went on with the new work for Crooke and Cooke and completed the Chamberlain and Habington plays by May or June. 6 I have attempted no complete study of these nine Cotes plays in terms of compositors, headlines, press corrections, and watermarks. There might never be time for that. But I have gathered data on all and have made a detailed study of one important quarto, The Opportunitie . I have examined twenty copies of this play for press corrections and twelve copies for watermarks. A full collation of eight copies and a partial collation of others has revealed corrections in just five formes: inner and outer C, outer F, inner G, and inner K. Several of those in outer C and outer F bespeak a corrector of intelligence and resource, but those in the other formes are mechanical and routine, though useful in the study of printing-house practice. This difference in the kinds of corrections may itself suggest inferences concerning the order of formes through the press. Press Corrections in The Opportunitie Forme Literal Punctuational Literary Uncorrected copies % C(i) 5 3 1 10 ex 20 50 C(o) 3 7 4 3 " " 15 F(o) 0 5 2 7 " " 35 G(i) 5 9 0 1 " " 5 K(i) 2 0 0 1 " " 5 The table shows the number and frequency of corrections for each forme. If the sample is a fair one, we have indications that half the edition sheet of inner C was run before corrections were made, amounting to nine small changes. Corrections were also made in the outer forme, somewhat sooner in its run, apparently when the reader discovered blunders in the sense. One suspects there had been earlier corrections when the compositor looked over his type or preliminary proofs were taken. In outer F a good third of the sheets remained uncorrected. But of inner G and of inner K only single uncorrected copies have come to light. Their rarity suggests the possible existence of other uncorrected (inner) formes. Study of the headlines in The Opportunitie reveals two distinct skeletons. These show regular and normal transference from forme to forme, except for interchanges of formes at four points and turns of skeleton X at inner E and inner K. This is the pattern of the two skeletons: Skeleton X: B(i) C(o) D(o) E(i) t F(o) G(o) H(i) I(i) K(i) t Skeleton Y: B(o) C(i) D(i) E(o) F(i) G(i) H(o) I(o) K(o) Judging from the treatment of speech prefixes and spellings, the early sheets were set by two compositors, but from about sheet E on by a single and different compositor. 7 If there is more than coincidence in the turning of skeleton X at inner E, one may suspect an interruption in the work on the quarto there. 8 With these bibliographical features of the quarto in mind, we turn to the watermarks in The Opportunitie . There seem to be seven. The accompanying table shows their distribution in the twelve copies examined, together with the incidence of corrections in these copies. The pot watermark common to sheets B and C is a one-handled pot surmounted by fleuron and crescent; its bowl, measuring 19 mm. across, bears the letters Gro -- probably indicating manufacture by the Rousel family in France. 9 One copy in sheet B has a slightly larger pot with two slender handles and a round bowl of 22 mm., bearing a fleurde-lis. 10 The characteristic mark of sheets B to F is the very Christian symbol IHS with cross mounted on the bar of the H; 11 it measures 36 x 36 mm. 12 Associated with this paper (in the same edition sheets) is one showing a small bird (45 x 27 mm.) with pointed head, wings outstretched, and tail fanned out: I find nothing like it in Briquet, Bofarull, 13 or Nicolaï. 14 As these IHS and bird papers are similarly associated in other plays, 15 they probably had the same origin and came packed together, that is, with tokens or reams of each in the same lot or bale. Twice in sheet D occurs a U-shaped spray of flowers (48 mm. across) with letters or leaves between the stems. 16 Then in sheets G, H, I, K, and half-sheet A comes a great harvest of grapes. These grapes are fifteen to a bunch, in diamond form (18 x 13 mm.), with a bit of stem. 17 Among the grapes in sheet H twice appears a crown, over the initials GP (22 mm. wide)—perhaps those of the maker of the grape paper. Except for the bird and spray watermarks, these are all common types and indicate papers imported from France, perhaps from the mills of Normandy. 18 As some copies of the quarto measure at least 7" x 5¼" or more, these papers appear to have been of old demy size or about 14½" x 10½". 19 Watermarks in The Opportunitie ICU DFo 1 DFo 2 DFo 3 MH 1 MH 2 A ...... d ...... d Grapes n Grapes n ...... d Grapes d B Pot-fl Pot Pot IHS IHS IHS C Bird c c Pot u u Pot c u Pot c u Pot u u IHS c c D IHS Bird Spray IHS IHS Bird E IHS IHS IHS Bird Bird IHS F IHS c IHS c IHS c IHS u IHS u Bird c G Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c H Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes I Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes K Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c DLC 1 DLC 2 NNP ICN IEN S A Grapes d Grapes n Grapes d Grapes n Grapes d [Missing] B IHS Pot IHS IHS Pot Pot C IHS c c Bird c c Pot c u IHS c c Bird c c Pot u u D Spray IHS IHS Bird IHS IHS E IHS Bird IHS IHS IHS Bird F IHS u IHS c IHS u IHS c Bird c IHS c G Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c H Grapes Grown/GP Crown/GP Grapes Grapes Grapes I Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes Grapes K Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Grapes c Collation: A 2 B-K 4 .

The watermarks in The Opportunitie fall into three main groups: pots, IHS-birds, and grapes. There is a certain orderliness in their distribution. Though the marks in various Caroline plays give the impression of chaos, 20 here in a dozen copies we are aware of balance and continuity—a record of presswork in palimpsest form. The striking feature of sheet B is the equal division into six pot and six IHS watermarks. This division is repeated in sheet C: six pot and three each of IHS and bird watermarks. More startling is the distribution of press corrections in C: the six uncorrected exemplars of the inner forme are printed on the six sheets of pot-G/RO paper, and the six corrected exemplars of that forme are printed on the other two papers. Further, the three uncorrected exemplars of the outer forme likewise appear on the pot paper, backed of course by the uncorrected state of the inner forme. Clearly, so neat a distribution may be fortuitous, for we are analyzing a sample of precisely twelve copies; 21 yet sheets D, E, F serve to clarify and stress the pattern. This pattern involves multiples of two. Sheet D, indeed, with two spray, seven IHS, and three bird watermarks, varies from even quantities. But E is divided neatly into eight and four, and F into ten and two. (As the IHS mark tends to outnumber the bird, it looks now as if the original proportion of these papers in sheet C may have been four to two.) With sheet G comes a shift to a new watermark and a steady outpouring of grapes, except for two crown marks in H. There are just four instances of uncorrected readings in outer F, and they fall only on IHS paper. The variant formes of G and K are printed on (apparently) invariant paper. 22 If in the latter part of the quarto the rhythm of two's is somewhat obscured, it is not obviously disturbed. The distribution we have observed bears substantial implications for the size of the edition and for the order of the formes through the press. The first is the easier to see. The edition was probably one of 1500 copies. This quantity best satisfies both the distribution ratios and the external evidence. 23 If we adopt the working assumption that each watermark in the table represents a half-token of paper (five quires), we can follow the course of the press (or presses) from paper to paper fairly well. We reckon in tokens as the seventeenth-century pressman commonly did. The hypothesis works this way. Whatever was the first forme on the press and the number of presses involved, sheet B used three tokens or 750 sheets each of IHS paper and pot paper. The pot paper was continued and printed the uncorrected state of inner C, using three more tokens and thus completing three reams of pot paper. The rest of the edition sheet must have been made up of a ream of IHS paper and a token of bird paper, or vice versa (the table showing 3's for each). Sheet D used a stray token of spray paper along with perhaps two reams of IHS and a token of bird paper (the ratio being 2:7:3). Sheet E is easy: exactly two reams of IHS and one of bird (8:4); and so is F, with five tokens of IHS and one of bird (10:2). At this point the warehouse boy opened up a bale of grape paper, and the press (or presses) proceeded monotonously through thirteen reams of it (sheet G to half-sheet A), unrelieved except for a token of crown paper which turned up during the printing of sheet H. An edition of 1500 fits with other evidence and considerations. (1) The Opportunitie was made up in three lots, with variant imprints: the main lot for Crooke and Cooke, a smaller one for Crooke alone, and a few copies for sale in Dublin. (2) I have located thirty-six copies in libraries and a dozen others in sale or auction catalogs. Thus the edition was clearly one of some size. (3) Shirley was a popular dramatist in his time and also liked on the Restoration stage; yet Andrew Crooke found it unnecessary to reprint any of Shirley's plays in which he had rights. 24 (4) The Stationers' Company had long permitted editions of 1250 and 1500, and the number had been increased to 1500 and 2000 in 1635. 25 In July 1639 the Company specifically gave John Benson "leaue to print an Imp r ssion of 1500" copies of a second edition of Davenant's play The Tragedy of Albovine 26 —though apparently he did not do so. (5) As Mr. Hinman has pointed out, two sets of headlines (such as The Opportunitie has) would hardly save time in presswork, due to the time needed for typesetting, unless the edition was one of at least 1200 copies. 27 (6) An edition of 1500 is implied by certain evidence concerning the rate of presswork presently to be offered. 28 Before taking up the problem of the order of the formes through the press, we should know the number of presses available. The Cotes establishment was an important one and must have operated at least two presses. The Jaggards had had two in their day. Mr. Willoughby has shown that their output for 1619-1623 averaged more than four hundred edition sheets a year, far more than one press would be able to handle. 29 Thomas and Richard Cotes, their successors, carried on a business of similar size. 30 And in 1637 a Star Chamber decree allowed the master printers, Thomas Cotes among them, two presses, or, rather, no more than two presses. 31 As this act seems not to have been closely enforced, 32 we need to allow for the possibility that Cotes had a third press, possibly some worn relic of Jaggard days, useful mainly for proofing 33 and for printing broadsides. Two presses, however, would provide ample means for printing six to ten edition sheets a week (depending on the size of the edition), 34 along with opportunities for proofing and for minor pieces of presswork. Thus the resources of the Cotes shop in the Barbican allowed a choice between one press and two presses for the printing of a quarto. The nature of the work, as well as the habits of the shop, would ordinarily decide the question. In general, two presses (printing simultaneously or in relay) might be employed when a single job was in hand or when a certain book was given priority over others; and one press for each might be used when two books were in process and full use needed to be made of workmen, type, and presses. By allocating each quarto to separate compositors and pressmen and a single press, a master printer might reasonably expect that work on two plays would go forward simultaneously without confusion of formes or printed sheets. Circumstances would modify practice, of course, but a system of alternating the work on two presses between two books would have been no system at all. These considerations imply that The Opportunitie , as one of a series of play-quartos, would normally be printed on a single press. For clues as to Cotes's method of handling such quartos, let us turn to the watermarks in The Night-Walker and The Coronation , their marks being much like those in The Opportunitie . The accompanying table shows the distribution in a few copies of these plays. The Night-Walker has six watermarks in common with The Opportunitie : pot-G/RO, pot-fleur-de-lis, IHS, bird, spray, grapes, plus two others, a lion on a shield and a belt encircling a quartered shield. The distribution looks a little wild: each copy has five to seven different marks within nine and a half sheets. Yet sheet B has one consistent mark—grapes (its only appearance in the quarto). 35 And sheets G and H show a division between two marks, pot and IHS; other sheets a Watermarks in The Night-Walker ICU DFo 1 DFo 2 ICN PU A Pot-fl ......

Without further evidence we cannot say whether such distributions are characteristic of the use of two presses. The case of The Coronation is clearer. With just two to five watermarks to a copy, it has four in common with The Opportunitie : IHS, bird, grapes, and crown/GP, plus the belt mark found in The Night-Walker . Their relatively simple pattern is surprisingly like that of The Opportunitie . There is the same general progression from IHS-bird to grape papers, except that The Coronation reached the run of grape paper at F, one sheet behind The Opportunitie . 36 In sheets B and C of The Coronation the belt paper occupies more or less the place of the pot-G/RO paper. The IHS paper continues commoner than the associated bird paper. And again the crown paper occurs sporadically among the reams of grapes. The inference is inescapable: The Coronation was going through the press at very nearly the same time as The Opportunitie . 37 Placed side by side, the tables tell a similar story of moving from IHS and associated papers into a long run of grape paper. The simplest explanation is that the two plays were being printed on separate presses fed by the same job-lot supply of paper. There is again the contrary suggestion of more than one press in the use of three papers in sheets B to F of The Coronation , but just such a mixture of papers may have come from the stockroom. The very differences in the two sets of watermarks support the hypothesis of separate presses. During the printing of sheets B and C of these plays press 1 was supplied with several reams of pot paper, and press 2 with a similar amount of belt paper. At sheet F, press 2 (printing The Coronation ) came upon a little more belt paper, possibly a remainder from its earlier use. The spray paper occurs only in The Opportunitie . And only in The Coronation does the grape paper turn up from time to time before the main body of the grape paper is reached. 38 Thus, the general similarities and particular differences together argue that the two plays were printed on separate presses during approximately the same period of time. That this is probably the right view, at least for the latter two-thirds of The Opportunitie , is attested by the apparent fact of a single compositor there. When composition must keep up with two presses, we may expect to find alternate setting by two compositors. But when a single press undertakes an edition of 1250 or 1500, one compositor should be able to keep up with its demands. 39 Though there are signs of two compositors in the first third of the play, particularly in sheet C, for the present it is safer to assume a single press there, too. Now we can attempt to plot the order of the formes through the press, using what we know of compositors, headlines, corrections, the edition size, the presses available—and the papers laid out. As some of the evidence is itself inferential and limited by the number of copies examined, and as the patterns of the watermarks are under consideration as new evidence, we need rather to explore the more likely methods of presswork than grasp at conclusions. However, the new material considerably extends the range of enquiry and perhaps leads us close to right answers. For the present we assume that 1500 copies of The Opportunitie were printed on a single press. Sheet B has been composed. Skeleton X has been made up and placed about its inner forme, and skeleton Y made up (with an ornament at the head of the first page of text) and placed about its outer forme. Whichever forme went first on the press might be a matter of chance if B4 v was composed before the press was made ready or if preliminary proofs were taken before presswork began. Though there is some reason to think the normal procedure in Cotes's shop was inner forme on first, 40 the beginning forme would matter less than later ones. Here, on first analysis, it looks as if the press began with the outer forme. In the absence of variants in sheet B the watermarks offer a clue—that is, the watermarks of B in their relation to the watermarks and corrections of C. Assuming (what is reasonable but uncertain) that the pot papers in sheets B and C were a continuous run of just three reams among the prevailing IHS paper, we see that printing might begin with the outer forme on three tokens of IHS paper, and then proceed to a similar quantity of pot paper. In this manner skeleton Y would be first through the press and available for imposing about the inner forme of C as soon as seven type-pages of this signature had been composed. The shift of the skeleton from an outer to an inner forme would be natural enough. There is, however, a better explanation of this shift. It lies in the pattern of the headlines through the quarto. As we have noted, there is a shift of skeletons not only after B, but likewise after D (with a turn of skeleton X), after E, and after G; and between I and K—though there is no shift—skeleton X is turned to starting position. Thus we find a rhythm of alternate sheets, except for a change of accent or quickening of tempo at sheet E. 41 I have an idea that the correct explanation is that which Mr. Bowers has recently found for a similar phenomenon in the Pide Bull Lear : a shift means the end of a day's labor, or some like pause in the work. 42 Indeed, the rhythm suggests a rough printing schedule for the play. We may suppose that Cotes's well-ordered establishment, using two skeletons, normally printed and perfected about 1000 sheets (two reams) on one press in one day. 43 Thus, in machining an edition of 1500, completion of a sheet would tend to coincide with the end of the work-day every third day. Ordinarily a sheet begun on a morning would be two-thirds done by the evening and quite finished at noon the next day; and the following sheet would be one-third done by the second evening and completely perfected by the third evening. And, it will be noted, if all went well the presswork on four edition sheets might neatly fill a week. Then what precisely caused the shifts? Probably the habits of certain compositors in the shop of Thomas Cotes. If the compositor preferred to wait till the end of the day to distribute type, 44 at the end of any third day he would have on his workbench both formes of the sheet finished that day. If he placed the second forme on the bench below the first, pushing the first up and out of the way, the second forme (last off the press) would of course be the nearer one to him when he began distributing. And in this situation he would naturally attend to the nearer forme first. If in stripping this forme he placed its skeleton around the next forme designed for the press, and was consistent in the forme he sent first to press, he would bring about the sort of shift of skeleton that occurred four times during the printing of the play. The twice-turning of skeleton X might come from setting the forme down elsewhere before finding room for it on the bench. And the omission of a shift between sheets I and K may have been due to the nature of K, which, ending in the midst of K4 r , might the more readily receive the waiting skeleton X about its inner forme before outer I with skeleton Y came from the press. 45 We now return to the presswork on the early sheets, better able to imagine how they were handled. We see that the inner forme of sheet B may after all have been first on the press if the completion of work on the sheet coincided with the end of a day. If so, presswork must have commenced sometime during the previous day. Actually the shift may have come about either through beginning printing with the outer forme or beginning distribution with the second forme at the end of the day, though the sequence of shifts favors the latter view. In either case, we assume that the pressman began printing on IHS paper and after about 750 sheets went on to the first tokens of pot paper. If work commenced around noon, about mid-morning of the second day he would turn the pile and, the work moving smoothly, perfect the whole of it before going home to supper. And in the meantime sheet C would have been composed. Sheet C is unusually interesting because of the close correspondence between its variations in text and paper. The chances are that the printing of this sheet began on a morning with the inner forme (and skeleton Y) on the press. The priority of the inner forme is particularly suggested by the fact that fifty per cent of the exemplars are uncorrected—that half the white paper was printed before the corrector arrived—whereas outer C received corrections after about 15 per cent of its pulls. The pressman, continuing with the pot paper used in B, began in the middle of a ream of it and finished three tokens before pausing for corrections and then going on to a fresh supply of IHS (and bird) paper, on which he impressed the whole of the corrected state. After thus taking 750 pulls of each state, by mid-afternoon he would be ready to turn the pile of printed sheets and begin perfecting the lot. He would perfect perhaps a token with outer C (and skeleton X) in uncorrected state, pause again for corrections, and perfect another token with the corrected forme before quitting for the day—if he completed the 2000 daily pulls we have assumed. The following morning would be sufficient for perfecting the remaining 1000 sheets. This treatment of sheet C envisages the "normal" procedure of printing the whole run of white paper with one forme before turning the pile and perfecting with the other forme; 46 and the pauses for corrections might be suitably filled with the taking of proofs 47 or necessary work about the press. 48 However, there is a modification of this method which would make more efficient use of the pressman's time and such evidence as the relative quantities of uncorrected pulls for the two formes. It is odd that half the pulls of inner C should be uncorrected and a third of these backed with uncorrected pulls of the outer forme—when only three later formes exhibit corrections, and these with normal percentages in different sheets. But, as will be seen presently, sheet C must have been printed around Easter; and on the morning of Easter Even or Easter Monday Tom Cotes or the corrector might come to the printing-house late. Now then. The pressman, while printing the three tokens of uncorrected inner C, may have become aware of the need of corrections and decided not to go beyond the mid-point of the run without them. He had a heap of 750 sheets and had exhausted the supply of pot paper. Having proceeded so far, he might turn the heap, substitute the outer forme on the bed of the press, and begin printing with little fear of smudging. By noon he would have perfected about a token (one third) of the printed sheets, thus completing 1000 pulls for the morning. About this time (we may suppose) the corrector appeared and attended to the inner forme, and then in a burst of virtuosity corrected the outer forme as well. I am led to this inference not merely by the three to one ratio of uncorrected pulls and the neatness of the hypothesis but by the presence of "literary" corrections in these formes, perhaps one in inner C and four in outer C. 49 After study of the variant and invariant formes in several quartos, I am of the opinion that Cotes's formes commonly received cursory correction before printing commenced, 50 and I consider such corrections as those in outer C and outer F, and possibly those in inner C, true stop-press corrections, the second sets of corrections made in those formes. Obviously, second corrections would be made only where first corrections proved insufficient from the point of view of printer's style or reader's sense. There is no way of knowing whether both uncorrected states of sheet C were printed ahead of the corrected states, but this method accords precisely with the evidence. In the afternoon the pressman would go ahead with the corrected formes, presumably first printing the second half of the run of inner C, on IHS and bird papers, and then, towards the end of the day, perfecting about one token with corrected outer C. As before, he would finish perfecting the edition sheet the next morning. There is less evidence as to the manner of printing the sheets that followed C, but what there is fits the hypothesis of 1500 copies printed on a single press at the rate of one edition sheet in a day and a half. If the perfecting of sheet C was completed on a morning, the press could begin printing the white paper of sheet D in the afternoon. No late corrections were made, 51 and the sequence of the three watermarks is doubtful. 52 Assuming normal procedure, with the inner forme on the press first and printing the whole run of paper before the exchange of formes, we may suppose that 1000 sheets were printed in the afternoon, that perfecting began about the middle of the next morning, that the sheet was completed by evening. At this point comes the second shift of skeletons—and the turning of skeleton X. Sheet E is an anomaly, for a third shift of skeletons occurs between it and the following sheet. There are indications of a change of compositors, perhaps in the midst of E1 r . 53 There are no variants, and the watermarks imply an orderly run of two reams of IHS paper and one ream of bird paper. We may imagine some sort of delay, due to holidays, the change in compositors, or the need of the press for other work. 54 The delay may have been half a day or as much as a day and a half. At any rate, it is convenient to suppose that the printing of this sheet began about noon of one day and ended at the close of the next. For at this point comes the third shift in skeletons. Continuing our hypothetical schedule, we find particular support for it in the corrections of outer F. If the printing of inner F (invariant) took the usual three-fourths of a day, the press would have time to perfect 500 sheets in the late afternoon. These correspond to the proportion of uncorrected sheets in the run, one-third. Over night the need of corrections was noted, and they were made. That these were second corrections is indicated by the fact that none were literal corrections, two amended the sense, 55 and the remaining five strengthened the punctuation. Presumably, then, the corrected outer forme perfected the last 1000 sheets on the following morning. Noting that the uncorrected state is on IHS paper, we may infer that the perfecting, and therefore likewise the printing of the white paper, commenced with a ream of IHS paper. The order of the other two reams is not clear, but the principle of continuity would put the (token of) bird paper at the end of the run. At this point the change to grape paper took place. There is nothing to suggest a delay, for the new paper was probably laid out and dampened the night before. Our alternating schedule starts the printing of sheet G in an afternoon. If inner G went on the press first, either several proofs were taken or else printing proceeded while the proofs were being read. For this time the fourteen corrections include five literal changes, nine punctuation additions or substitutions, and no alterations of verbal sense. It was a quick job, or one done at lunchtime: only a few uncorrected quires can have been printed, for just one uncorrected copy has come to light. As this copy has a grape watermark, 56 apparently the whole edition sheet is so marked. On the second day of grape paper the heap would be ready to turn by mid-morning, and perfecting could be completed by night. The fourth shift of skeletons took place here. Sheets H and I involve no problems and may be assigned to the third, fourth, and fifth days of grape paper. The two crown/ GP watermarks among the twelve exemplars in H may be a good clue to the source of the grape paper, but they seem to tell us nothing about presswork. The imposition of sheet K was accompanied by no shift of skeleton but instead a turning of skeleton X as inner K received it. When this forme went on the press (first or last), two small corrections were made in the final type-page after only a few pulls had been taken. (Corrections may have been made already in the three earlier pages of the forme.) These amounted to one perverse change in a speech-prefix 57 and one correction of broken type. Such changes might be made without removing the forme from the press. And thus the machining of sheet K would go ahead relatively smoothly on grape paper and reach completion about noon of its second day. With the nine edition sheets of text out of the way, the press would proceed to the preliminaries, half-sheet A. At about this time Shirley, on arriving from Ireland, visited the printing-house, and penned his dedication to Captain Richard Owen. 58 In it he tells us he found The Opportunitie "emergent from the Presse, and prepar'd to seeke entertainment abroad." If there was no delay, this dedication as well as the title-page should have been in type by the morning on which the last sheets of K were perfected, and the greater part of the required half-sheets might be wrought off the same day. The most likely treatment would be imposition in a single forme 59 and printing by the print-and-turn method. 60 That is, the forme would be made up of the title (A1 r ), a blank (A1 v ), the dedication (A2 r ), and "The Actors Names" (A2 v ), arranged clockwise in the chase, with the title at lower left (or upper right); and as usual the sheets would be turned endwise for perfecting by the same forme. 61 Now, the matter is complicated by variant imprints and a curious distribution of watermarks. Three lots were made up for the publishers: (1) the main one for Crooke and Cooke, dated 1640; (2) a smaller one for Crooke alone, not dated; and (3) a few copies for Crooke to sell in Dublin, dated 1640. These states exist in percentages of approximately 58, 40, and 2. 62 The watermark table shows state 1 fairly equally divided between watermarked and unwatermarked ends, but state 2 printed only on watermarked ends. Of five copies of this state examined, 63 five are watermarked with grapes, none unwatermarked. (State 3 is the unique Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington copy and is mounted so as to obscure watermarks.) The explanation of this distribution does not seem easy, particularly as we do not know how consistently watermarked ends were arranged in a ream. It probably would be easier for a paper maker to gather sheets consistently, and the run of watermarks in certain folio and quarto sheets seems uniform, but little is known about the point. In the present half-sheet we must assume either a freakish distribution or a fairly consistent arrangement of the sheets on which the undated state was printed. A possible explanation, offered tentatively, is this. The pressman printed the complete run of the main state, 64 say 875 copies (three and a half tokens), before turning the heap and perfecting with states 2 and 3. If the title fell on unwatermarked ends during the first ream and on watermarked ends during the rest of the run, the ratio of blanks to marks for state 1 would be about five to four. After the imprint was changed and the heap had been turned, the pressman would be printing the undated title on watermarked ends for the space of a ream and on unwatermarked ends for a few quires beyond, if, say, 625 copies were needed of the two Crooke states. 65 If we allow a quire for state 3 (a few copies to sell in Dublin), the ratio of marks to blanks for state 2 would be about five to one. However, the press would go on perfecting so that the whole of state 1 might include the dedication. The objection to this method is that it wastes upwards of 250 half-sheets, though some allowance may be made for proofs, unsatisfactory pulls, and possibly printer's copy books 66 and title-pages to be used as posters. On the other hand, an initial run of 875 or 900 sheets would just about fill an afternoon, and would conveniently put the whole of the main state on one side of the sheet. No simple, economical explanation seems available. 67 When ingenuity tires, we may fall back on eccentric distribution as an almost-acceptable answer. Thus far we have assumed that The Opportunitie was printed wholly on a single press. We need now to explore briefly the possibility that a few of the early sheets were printed instead on two presses. Reasons for making allowance for this possibility include: (1) the neat division between pot and other watermarks in sheets B and C; (2) the evidence of two compositors in C, suggesting rapid composition; (3) the three to one ratio of uncorrected pulls in the two formes of C, suggesting a lag between presses; and (4) the incidence of Easter, 5 April 1640, 68 and consequent abnormal working conditions in the printing-house. These reasons are not material, but they are clues worth investigating. The equal balance between pot and IHS watermarks in sheet B urges the idea of simultaneous printing on two presses. Simultaneous printing would seem a natural method for machining the first sheet of a play, if two presses were available. 69 Press 1 (say) might begin with the inner forme (skeleton X) and print a ream and a half of pot paper, while press 2 would take the outer forme (skeleton Y) and print a similar amount of IHS paper. At this point the pressmen would exchange heaps and begin to perfect each other's work. The first man through would provide the first forme on of the next sheet; and this in itself might cause such a shift in skeletons as that between B and C. At this stage single-press printing might begin, or both presses might continue. However, sheet C cannot have been printed simultaneously, for the uncorrected states are found back to back. The relay system might be used—that in which one press prints and the other perfects. 70 Following this method, we may suppose that press 1 would continue with pot paper, using up the second ream and a half of it before pausing for corrections. When they arrived, it probably would go on to impress the corrected inner state on IHS and bird paper. In that case press 2 might follow after a ream or so with the uncorrected state of outer C. 71 An advantage of this procedure is that press 2 might receive corrections at much the same time as press 1, that is, after press 1 had printed three tokens (half the run) and press 2 had perfected about one. If the inner forme received its corrections first, the lag of the second press might be more than a ream, and there would be little danger of smudging. But all three papers would have to originate with press 1. The apparently balanced distribution of papers in sheet C suggests an interesting variation. After press 1 had printed the three tokens of pot paper, it could receive the outer forme and begin perfecting. In the meantime inner C, now corrected, might find press 2 idle and use it for printing the second half of the edition sheet, on IHS and bird paper laid out for that press. Press 1 after perfecting a token would need to stop for corrections, about midday. It might end in perfecting the sheets printed by both presses. Whatever the system used to print sheet D, it looks as if perfecting was completed at the end of a day, when a shift of skeletons took place. The time needed for relay printing is not easy to reckon, but two presses could handle an edition-sheet of 1500 in one day if the second press followed the first by two or three tokens. In the meantime, however, the first press would be able to go on to new work. The uncertainties are too many in view of our little acquaintance with two-press work and the meanings of watermarks. At present the best evidence in favor of the use of two presses in any sheet of The Opportunitie seems to be that of two compositors at work on sheet C—where there might be the need of keeping up with two presses turning out sheet B. Actually, the intrusive compositor seems to have set just two pages of C, and there might be various reasons for his appearance. If we could assign a single two-press method to sheets B, C, D, the idea of two presses would be more attractive. Or if the pot paper of B and C extended into D, we might accept two-press printing for B and C. However, so neatly does the one-press hypothesis fit with the meaning suggested for the skeleton shifts, with the apparent relation between press corrections and watermarks in sheets C and F, and with the evidence of parallel work on The Opportunitie and The Coronation —there seems little reason to look for an ornate explanation. At the same time, it is manifest that we need more light on two-press methods; and it looks as if variant watermarks, when studied, may furnish some. There remains the question of the approximate period during which The Opportunitie was put through the press. We have a fairly definite terminus ad quem . After some three years in Ireland, Shirley returned to England in mid-April 1640. 72 He must have reached London about Monday, April 20. 73 As he found his play "emergent from the Preffe, and prepar'd to feeke entertainment abroad," we may take it that sheets B to K were then printed and ready, or sheet K was coming from the press. Reckoning back in terms of 1500 copies, a single press, and the skeleton shifts, we can make a schedule with tentative dates. It starts on April Fool's day and need not be taken as revelation. April 1, 2, 4 (Wed.-Sat. of Holy Week). Sheet B composed and printed. A compositor would set about six pages on the first day, 74 and printing might begin late on the morning of the 2nd. If the pressman did not labor on Good Friday, but worked all day Saturday, he would finish perfecting the sheet by that evening; and the first skeleton shift would come at the end of a week. Meanwhile, sheet C would be composed, one compositor setting two pages on Thursday afternoon (say) and another the remaining six on Saturday. April 6-11 (Easter week). Sheets C, D, E printed; C and D on the first three days, E after a delay (of uncertain length) on Friday-Saturday. The late corrections in inner C may be due to the late arrival of the Cotes brothers or their corrector on Easter Monday. Skeleton X got turned at the time of the delay, and the week ends with the third shift of skeletons. April 13-18 (Mon.-Sat.). Sheets F, G, H, I printed. If inner F was printed first and outer F was the perfecting forme, corrections must have been made between days after a ream of uncorrected pulls. The press handled a normal week's run of four edition-sheets. At the end of the week skeleton X got turned again. April 20-22 (Mon.-Wed.). Sheet K and half-sheet A printed. Shirley came to the printing-house on Monday or Tuesday and wrote the dedication to Captain Owen. If there were no delay, the half-sheet might be printed on Tuesday afternoon and perfected on Wednesday morning. Gathering into copies might take place later the same day. Though there is no way to check the details of this schedule, the general idea in it seems right enough, and the imagined sequence is instructive. We realize that one press would take nearly three weeks to produce an edition of 1500 copies. We note that Easter may have contributed to the irregularities of sheet C. The shifts and turns of skeleton suggest reasonable allocations of work to particular days and weeks. And through analogy we can measure the amount of time Cotes took to print The Coronation , and perhaps the whole series of 1639/40 Fletcher-Shirley quartos. We can now cast up accounts. Study of the variant watermarks 75 in The Opportunitie has enabled us to draw several useful inferences: (1) It was printed in an edition of 1500 copies. (2) It was produced mainly or wholly on a single press parallel with The Coronation . (3) Late corrections, when made, occurred between tokens or reams, and sometimes at noon or night. (4) Composition and presswork on the quarto took approximately the first three weeks of April 1640. Similar study of other play quartos, and indeed books of various formats, dates, and printers, should improve the quality of such inferences, and should throw light on two-press work and other procedures of the printing-house. One weakness of watermarks as evidence is their inherent ambiguity. And they lend themselves to subtleties and complications. Clearly, he who looks for meaning in their permutations needs to temper ingenuity with calm common sense. Bibliographers who fear madness may prefer to let them alone. There are, however, some simple uses of variant watermarks that may help to preserve sanity. I mention three. First, an obvious point. Everyone knows that in first editions the preliminaries were commonly printed last, but everyone cannot readily demonstrate the fact. A glance at the tables of watermarks found in The Opportunitie and The Coronation is enough to assure oneself that half-sheet A of both these plays was printed at least among the last. However, the continuity of watermarks is sometimes lacking, as in Loves Crueltie and The Night-Walker; and in such cases there may have been a delay in printing the preliminary half-sheet. The second point presents a useful corollary. As press corrections are ever a highly important source of evidence as to what an author wrote, we need aids in searching them out. Variant watermarks are such an aid. After the investigator has listed the watermarks in several copies of a book, he will sometimes find such a contrast between papers as we have noted in sheets C and F of The Opportunitie . In these cases he may well suspect variants and begin collation in sheets with two contrasting marks. Naturally, he will not always find variants: collation of sheet B of The Opportunitie in terms of pot and IHS papers yields none; yet collation of the same papers in sheet C brings to light corrections in the inner forme, and may do so likewise in the outer forme. Clearly this should prove a time-saving device. Working without knowledge of the watermarks, one might examine five or even seven copies of The Opportunitie (among the twelve of the table) before finding variants in inner C. In collating some other sheets, the student would have fewer rewards, but before long he would have reason to suspect that most of the formes are invariant. The principle is simply this: Since textual variants sometimes occur on contrasting papers, one should collate formes printed on such papers first. To this may be added: Since composition of pages in normal order favored a custom of sending the inner forme to press first and the first forme might wait some time for corrections, 76 one should collate inner formes first, at least in two-skeleton printing. My first attempts to apply the principle were instructive. Noting that my copy of The Coronation differed from the University of Chicago copy in watermarks in several sheets, I collated these sheets—and found no variants. Then I realized that only in sheet E were the contrasting marks (bird and grapes) representative, so far as I could tell from five copies. Next I compared the Inderwick-Folger copy of The Night-Walker (using a microfilm) with the Newberry copy. The first two sheets I tried yielded variants. Sheet C, with bird and spray marks, proved variant in its inner forme. Sheet G, with pot and IHS marks, proved variant in its outer forme. Testing farther, I listed the watermarks in three copies of A Pastorall Called the Arcadia , "Written by Iames Shirly Gent." (an unlikely attribution) and printed by John Dawson, 1640. It is evident that Dawson was buying some of the same job-lot papers that Cotes bought. I noted that in sheet C my copy agreed with the Newberry copy in its watermark (lion on a shield) but not with the Chicago copy (15 grapes). Turning at once to the inner forme, I found no corrections on C1 v , but at C2 r 4 "wisper" in my copy and "whisper" in the Chicago copy. Thus admonished, I did not shout. But, whatever my run of luck, I was confident I had a gadget that would save some time in collation. The third (and last) point illustrates the surprises that may lurk in watermarks. Examining the University of Chicago copy of The Queene of Arragon , by William Habington, I rejoiced to find three watermarks I knew well—in the midst of folio pages where I could measure them: several IHS marks, many grape marks, and once the bird with wings outstretched. A few days later I looked at the Newberry copy, and discovered a startling thing. The watermarks were different. No IHS marks, no bird mark, just one thin page with grapes. The prevailing mark in the Newberry copy is a long heraldic panel surmounted by a thin cross, the whole not too plain. 77 The paper is thicker than the intrusive grape paper and apparently of a better sort. What is the solution to this little mystery? Although I have not had the copies side by each, I can hardly doubt they are the same setting. The play (collation A 2 B-H 4 I 3 ) is probably too long to leave in standing type. My guess is that Habington, a butterfly sort of courtier-poet, had a number of copies printed on better-grade paper for himself and his friends, and that Tom Cotes simply included a token or so of this paper in the paper laid out for each sheet. It might be printed last in each edition-sheet so as to benefit from corrections. There would have to be care in gathering the fancy copies, and it is not surprising that one bunch of grapes got in by accident or lack of a fine-paper sheet. 78 I have no idea whether such special printings were rare or not. "The matter deserves further study." 78a The purpose of this paper has been to call attention to the significance of variant or dissimilar watermarks for bibliographical study. Certain findings of the paper are naturally tentative, subject to the discoveries and corrections of further investigation. But enough has been done to show that the new tool, when its subtleties have yielded to patient analysis, will take its place beside press corrections, headlines, and our knowledge of hand presses as a useful means of enquiry into the manner in which books were made. Actually the tool is an old one put to new employment. A generation of scholars has used inconsistency in watermarks to spot cancels, 79 inserted sheets, 80 mixed issues, standing type, 81 made-up copies, facsimiles, 82 , and other irregularities. Indeed, les filigranes have come a long way since Briquet compiled his distinguished work, and since A. W. Pollard remarked in the 11th Britannica that watermarks are helpful in distinguishing between gatherings. I believe that their aid can be extended to the study of various normal, though relatively complex, situations, and that this aid will prove substantial when it is properly correlated with other bibliographical evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 McKerrow notes that "many printers bought their paper in job-lots, and it is common to find a number of different watermarks in a book about the printing of which there appears to have been nothing abnormal." Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford, 1927), p. 101 n. 2 I have had the experience of listing a certain watermark five different ways before discovering it was a lean lion rampant upon a twisted escutcheon. 3 The Cooke plays were entered on 12 April and 29 July 1639, the Crooke and Cooke plays with Loves Crueltie on 25 April 1639. W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , I (London, 1939), 50-51. Shirley controlled the whole group and published them while in Ireland. See my article, "Shirley's Publishers: the Partnership of Crooke and Cooke," The Library , 4th s., XXV (1944-45), 140-61. 4 These results will be printed elsewhere. 5 Greg, I, 52. 6 A companion Habington folio, The Historie of Edward the Fourth , entered ahead of the play, on 15 Nov. 1639 (Arber, iv, 489), has some of the same marks. Certain other Cotes folios and quartos of 1640, such as Parkinson's Theatrum Botanicum and Heywood's The Exemplary Lives and Memorable Acts of Nine the Most Worthy Women of the World , contain decidedly different watermarks. 7 Notable is the shift in the prevailing colloquial spelling of "would" from "wod" to "wud" and of "should" from "shod" to "shud." This is not likely due to a change in copyists, for the manuscript would seem to have been holograph. 8 The new compositor may have come from work on The Humorous Courtier , for at E4 r he set " Orf. " (as if for Orseolo) as the catchword instead of " Af. " (for Ascanio). Orseolo is the "humorous courtier" of the earlier play. 9 This pot occurs also in The Night-Walker and The Humorous Courtier . It is similar to Edward Heawood's no. 78 in "Papers Used in England after 1600," The Library , 4th s., XI (1930-31), 299. Heawood, p. 289, mentions a MS of 1633 with pot G/RO; and W. A. Churchill illustrates a pot G/RO of about 1645 as no. 469 in Watermarks in Paper in Holland, England, France, etc., in the XVII and XVIII Centuries and Their Interconnection (Amsterdam, 1935). 10 It resembles Heawood 89 and is found also in Wit without Money, The Night-Walker, The Humorous Courtier , and The Swaggering Damsell . 11 Similar "jesus" watermarks are illustrated in C. M. Briquet, Les filigranes (Paris, 1907), nos. 9461, 9463, 9465, and elsewhere. They were sometimes used as countermarks. 12 The measurements for the IHS, bird, and grape marks are taken from the folio pages of The Queene of Arragon (ICU copy). 13 Francisco de A. de Bofarull y Sans, Los animales en las marcas del papel (Villanueva y Geltrú, 1910). 14 Alexandre Nicolaï, Histoire des moulins à papier du sud-ouest de la France 1300-1800 (Bordeaux, 1935). 15 The Night-Walker, The Coronation, The Swaggering Damsell, The Queene of Arragon . A more homogeneous mixture of paper would be the normal result of the use of two moulds together in the manufacture of paper—see Louis Le Clert, Le papier (Paris, 1926), I, 17, and Dard Hunter, Papermaking (New York, 1943), pp. 88, 133. In fact, such trays were commonly made and used in matched pairs, so that one ordinarily cannot tell their watermarks apart. But in this group of plays the two marks are not at all alike and are not evenly distributed. Their association must be of a different kind. 16 It turns up also in Loves Crueltie, The Night-Walker , and The Humorous Courtier , but I find no parallel in the books. 17 Similar to Heawood, "Further Notes on Paper Used in England after 1600," The Library , 5th s., II (1947-48), no. 135 or 140, without the leaf and stem. Most illustrations, such as Briquet's show more than fifteen grapes. I find this mark in all seven of the Cotes plays dated 1640. Here it may be noted that the "1639" plays, Wit without Money and The Maides Revenge , contain some pots, letters, etc., not found in the 1640 plays, along with several marks that link them with them. 18 The indications are that the Rousel (or Rouse) mills were in Normandy. Cf. Heawood's notes on RO paper-marks in "Papers Used in England after 1600," pp. 282, 287, 291, and "Further Notes," p. 125, with his general evidence that most cheap papers came from northwestern France. A recent French authority provides a more definite clue: a legal record of 1636 shows that "Jean Huet et Nicole Rouxel, sa femme, natifs du pays et duché de Normandie," were paying "une chef rente de 12 l. 10 s. et un champart d'une rame de papier" for a mill near Morlaix in Brittany. See H. Bourde de la Rogerie, "Les papeteries de la région de Morlaix depuis le XV e siècle jusqu'au commencement du XIX e siècle," Contribution a l'histoire de la papeterie en France , VIII (Grenoble, 1941), 20. This monograph locates the mills of a number of Norman paper-makers, including some who had migrated to Brittany. The well-known Bodleian list of 1674 mentions various papers imported from Caen and Morlaix: R. W. Chapman, "An Inventory of Paper, 1674," The Library , 4th s., VII (1926-27), 406-8. 19 Chapman, p. 403. This is not quite half modern demy size. It has scarcely been noted that paper sizes have grown considerably since the Restoration. 20 The Warwick Castle-Folger copy of The Swaggering Damsell has this sequence of watermarks in nine sheets, A to I: grapes, two sorts of pots, lion, fleur-de-lis/PD, IHS, bird, grapes, IHS. 21 Readily factorable into pitfalls and snares. 22 The uncorrected copies are not among the twelve: they are respectively at Huntington and Texas. 23 A case might be made out for 2000 copies in terms of certain ratios and the number of surviving copies. But 1500 fits all the conditions and exactly suits the hypothesis on presswork discussed later. Similar considerations and the balanced distributions make an edition of 1250 or 1750 improbable. 24 He did reprint Fletcher's Wit without Money and The Night-Walker in 1661. 25 Arber, IV, 22. 26 Greg, I, 51. 27 Charlton Hinman, "New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual 1941 (New York, 1942), pp. 208-14. 28 An edition of 1500 means that perhaps 1525 copies of each sheet would be printed. A quire would be allowed for proofs, waste, and possibly a few printer's copies. See Francis R. Johnson, "Printers' 'Copy Books' and the Black Market in the Elizabethan Book Trade," The Library , 5th s., I (1946-47), 99-100. The extra quire might introduce a foreign watermark into an edition sheet—such as the pot-fleur-de-lis mark in sheet B of The Opportunitie . 29 Edwin E. Willoughby, The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (Oxford, 1932), pp. 27-28, and A Printer of Shakespeare: The Books and Times of William Jaggard (London, 1934), chs. xii-xiv. 30 Between 1627 and 1640 STC lists 264 books with Cotes imprints, an average of twenty books a year. 31 Henry R. Plomer, A Short History of English Printing (London, 1900), p. 179. 32 Ibid. , p. 181. For instance, certain disallowed printers, such as John Norton the younger, continued to print. 33 Several bits of evidence point to facilities for easy proofing in Cotes's shop: (1) the relative infrequency of variant formes in Cotes quartos (just 5 out of 19 in The Opportunitie , not counting variant imprints); (2) the indications that some of these few variant formes are due to second corrections or "revises" (as in outer C and outer F of The Opportunitie; and (3) the further indications that first corrections were made either before printing began or before more than a few quires had been printed (as in inner G and inner K of this play). See discussion below. As for special "proof presses," they are first mentioned in Restoration times. A table of the "Number of Presses and Workmen Employed in the Printing Houses of London in 1668" lists two proof presses, and assigns Mrs. Ellen Cotes, widow of Richard Cotes, "3 Presses, 2 Apprentices, 9 Pressmen" (Plomer, pp. 225-26). 34 And assuming about 1000 perfected sheets a day. 35 Raising the suspicion of a reprint or cancel sheet. 36 That is, if they reached this paper on the same day, The Opportunitie was a day or two farther advanced in its printing. 37 The Night-Walker as clearly was not, though it may have preceded (or followed) these plays. 38 Both presses would be supplied from the same stockpile or warehouse room, but the accidents of time and choice would cause variations in the papers set out for each press. 39 Hinman, pp. 209-12. 40 For instance, the headlines of The Humorous Courtier seem to reflect the rule of inner forme on the press first: Skeleton X: B(i) ... ... E(i) ... G(i) H(i) ... K(i, o) Skeleton Y: B(o) C(o) D(o) ... F(i) G(o) ... I(i) ... Skeleton Z: ... [C(i)] D(i) E(o) F(o) ... H(o) I(o) ... K is a half-sheet. Skeleton Z received changes of spelling after being set. If printing began on a single press with B(i), each inner forme thereafter used either the waiting (or new) skeleton or the first skeleton off. Any mixed method would not work so smoothly, and hitches would occur at E and G if the rule were to send outer formes to press first. 41 In terms of the inner forme the sequence is B(i)-X C(i)-Y D(i)-Y E(i)-X t F(i)-Y G(i)-Y H(i)-X I(i)-X K(i)-X t . Exact alternation would have given shifts after C E G I or B D F H. 42 Fredson Bowers, "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear," The Library , 5th s., II (1947-48), 31 n.1, 35. 43 Mr. Hinman has computed that a single press using one skeleton "as a rule printed daily about 900 perfected sheets," and remarks that "of course this number could sometimes be increased by the use of two skeletons." "New Uses for Headlines," pp. 209-10. 44 This would be regular. Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises , ed. T. L. De Vinne (New York, 1896), II, 210; quoted with comments by R. C. Bald, "Evidence and Inference in Bibliography," English Institute Annual 1941 , p. 17. 45 Or, if imposition took place with both skeletons on the bench, the compositor may have found it easier to send outer K to press first, because of its three type pages, and therefore transferred to it skeleton Y from the nearer forme of I. 46 For the most satisfactory hypothesis concerning the customary order of proofing, printing, and correction, see Bowers, "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear ," pp. 28-30, and his fuller discussion, "Elizabethan Proofing," Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies (Washington, 1948), pp. 571-86. 47 Such as preliminary proofs for outer C during the first pause or proofs for the other press ( The Coronation ) during either pause. 48 Bowers, "Proof Correction in Lear ," p. 42 n. 2, and "Elizabethan Proofing," p. 578. 49 Such as "redevivd" for "redevind" at C1 r 11 and "sister" for "sisters sister" at C3 r 20. Of literal corrections C(i) has 5 out of 9, while C(o) has just 3 out of 14. 50 The invariant formes in The Opportunitie are generally clear of broken type, transposed letters, turned letters, foul case, raised quads, and similar mechanical errors. It is mainly such faults that are marked for correction in the two surviving page proofs of the Shakespeare Folio of 1623, when Thomas Cotes (later clerk of St Giles Cripplegate: Arber, III, 704) was probably Jaggard's foreman and corrector. See Willoughby, The Printing of the First Folio , frontispiece and pp. 62-64, and Charlton Hinman, "A Proof-Sheet in the First Folio of Shakespeare," The Library , 4th s., XXIII (1942-43), 101-7. Though Mr. Willoughby takes the Anthony and Cleopatra proof-marks as those for a second correction, the high percentage of literal changes and the rarity of the uncorrected state (existent only in the proof itself and the Bridgewater-Huntington copy) suggest the probability that these were the first and only corrections made. Of the Othello corrections marked in the Jonas-Folger folio and found in 95% of the Folger folios, Mr. Hinman says (p. 103): "there can be no real question but that the forme was unlocked for correction only once." 51 Unless there was an adjustment of the fallen "y" in "young" at D2 v 22 (outer forme), its time of falling being uncertain. In copies checked, the defect occurs on all three papers used, and the correct form on spray and IHS papers. 52 For the error may have occurred at any time during the printing of the forme. 53 With a variation in speech-prefix forms. In this sheet only the full spellings "would" and "should" are used, "wud" making its first appearance at F1 v . And the catchword " Orf. ," reminiscent of the compositor of The Humorous Courtier , occurs at E4 r . 54 Such as the printing of playbills (Greg, 1, 35) or the perfecting of a sheet of The Coronation . 55 At F1 r 15 "and" became "or" and at F2 v 14 "Lady" was changed to "body." 56 The Huntington Library so reports. 57 That is, " Bo. " to " Bor. " at K4 r 15, leaving " Bo. " unchanged in line 2 above. 58 Shirley had just crossed the Irish Sea in Owen's ship the Ninth Whelp; see my article "Shirley's Years in Ireland," RES , XX (1944), 22-28. 59 One might expect to find that the preliminaries of The Opportunitie and The Coronation were printed together, with both titles in one forme. But they were not: the plays have an identical line of type on their title-pages, "As it was presented by her." And the title-page of The Coronation was not printed when Shirley was about the printing-house, for it assigns this his play to John Fletcher. 60 Dr. Greg shows that half-sheet "a" of Shirley's masque The Triumph of Peace (printed by J. Norton, 1633/4) was presumably handled in this manner. W. W. Greg, " The Triumph of Peace: A Bibliographer's Nightmare," The Library , 5th s., I (1946-47), 114. 61 An interesting question arises as to what might have happened if Shirley had not arrived home in time to include the dedication. Cotes could have printed the title and dramatis personae back to back within a half-sheet, but he seems to have had little liking for quartos beginning with a blank leaf. He might have put in the catalog of Shirley's publications which fills a page in the preliminaries of The Maides Revenge and The Humorous Courtier; or he might have had a dedication from another hand, something like the one Andrew Crooke furnished for Loves Crueltie . The problem did not arise in printing The Coronation , for it has a prologue to fill out its preliminary half-sheet. 62 My census at present locates 28 copies of state 1 (20 in libraries), 19 of state 2 (14 in libraries), and 1 of state 3 (at the Huntington Library). 63 The four in the table plus the Huntington copy. 64 Typographical relationships imply the sequence of states here assumed. The undated state looks like a hasty modification of the main imprint, for words are run together. The date "1640" in the Dublin imprint is reset. 65 This assumes proportions of 7 and 5 for the Crooke-Cooke issue as against the two Crooke issues. 66 In view of an ordinance of 1635, Cotes may have allowed his men copy money instead of copy books; see Johnson, "Printers' 'Copy Books' and the Black Market," p. 99. 67 The main alternative would be printing in half-formes alongside other material; but it is difficult to identify possible material. As we have seen, it could not be half-sheet A of The Coronation . Nor would it likely be half-sheet K of that play, for it uses the headlines from outer I in a pattern which apparently implies imposition in a single forme; see Mr. Bowers' discussion of headlines and half-sheet imposition in this present volume. No other plays of the group have the grape watermark in their preliminaries, except The Swaggering Damsell , and in that play they occupy a full sheet. 68 Julian reckoning. Checked by a perpetual calendar and an almanac for 1640. 69 Both presses might be available if Cotes was not yet ready to start printing The Coronation . As noted, The Opportunitie was one sheet farther along when it reached the grape paper. 70 For discussions of the relay or "staggered" method see Edwin Wolf 2d, "Press Corrections in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Quartos," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America XXXVI (1942), 193-96, and F. R. Johnson, "Press Corrections and Press-work in the Elizabethan Printing Shop," loc. cit. , XL (1946), 285-86. 71 The shift from simultaneous to relay printing might be decided on if one press had got ahead of the other while perfecting B, or if one press took a special job for a few hours, or if a pressman came late to work. Of course, the relay method might have been used for B as well, though it seems less likely for a first sheet using equal amounts of two different papers. 72 "Shirley's Years in Ireland," pp. 25-27. 73 A week later, on April 28, two plays which he probably had brought with him from Ireland were entered on the Register by Richard Whitaker. Greg, Bibliography , I, 53. 74 Hinman, "New Uses of Headlines," p. 209. 75 The term job-lot watermarks proves inadequate. For any shift of marks within an edition sheet or between sheets, whatever its cause, may be valuable evidence. Some quartos contain only two or three different watermarks; for instance, the Chicago copy of Shirley's St Patrick for Ireland (Raworth, 1640) contains two varieties of hand watermark, probably from the same factory; and their sources usually will not be job-lots of paper. The term variant watermarks may be used safely enough in general situations, though most advantageously where a dominant watermark provides a norm. 76 Cf. Bowers, "Proof Correction in Lear ," p. 29 and note. 77 This appears once in ICU—in the title-page (A1). 78 This sheet, F2-3, has the grape watermark in both copies. 78a Since writing this paragraph I have seen another copy of The Queene of Arragon , at the University of Pennsylvania. It contains none of the fine paper and resembles the Chicago copy, having as watermarks grapes (small), IHS, and once each a pot-G/RO and a large bunch of grapes. As it is the tallest of the three copies (11 1/8 x 7 1/8 in.), Newberry appears not to be a "large paper" copy. Two instances of presentation copies of play-quartos printed on fine paper are Jonson's Sejanus (1605) and Volpone (1607); see Greg, Bibliography , I, 342, 391. Mr. Heywood mentions several works printed on large paper in his "Further Notes," pp. 131-32. 79 Cf. McKerrow, p. 225. A recent example is in Southerne's The Disappointment (1684): Ray O.

      <field name="heading_text">A Bibliographical Note from the Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio Guy A. Battle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Beaumont and Fletcher first folio (1647) there are examples of a little-used type of bibliographical evidence: that of progressive changes in the boxlines. The boxlines were apparently made up of a number of flexible pieces which often were bent by the pressure of the furniture in a slightly different way each time they were set up with type. Consequently, a number of minute changes, which progressively developed as the boxlines were used, may be discerned. Because of the flexibility of these rules their evidence is tenuous, but often they will provide a clue as to forme-order or a support for other evidence. Indeed, sometimes even considered alone, this evidence cannot very well be ignored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For example, in the fifth section of the folio, one set of boxlines had a break in the top line, left side (with respect to the type). This remained constant for many printings, but on 5R2 r the gap was pushed together so that the rules overlapped. Then, on 5R3 r the rules were evidently wedged down by the furniture and remained in this position, unchanged, for printing many subsequent formes. Under a glass the progressive change is obvious and definite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is probable, then, that at this point the outer forme was printed before the inner forme. (One other small progressive change also supports this assumption.) Also, by the same kind of evidence two quite obvious forme sequences are indicated: that the inner forme of the outer sheet of 5P was printed before the outer forme of the inner sheet of 5Q and that the outer forme of the outer sheet of 5R was impressed before the outer forme of the middle sheet of 5S (a gathering of three sheets).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A close scrutiny of alterations in the rules that form boxlines, in conjunction with a study of their running-titles, will often, perhaps, reveal clues as to forme-order and provide valuable controls at certain points in bibliographical studies.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Center Rules in Folio Printing: A New Kind of Bibliographical Evidence James S. Steck</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even more useful than running-titles for identifying the skeleton-formes used to print a book are the box-rules enclosing the type-pages of various hand-printed folios. 1 Bald and Willoughby have demonstrated that the strips of metal constituting the box-rules were treated by early printers as integral parts of the skeleton-forme. However, a problem which has not been formally considered is the relation of the center rule separating the two columns of a double-column folio type-page to the enclosing box-rules. A study of Section 5 of the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio produces previously unsuspected bibliographical evidence which, when fully developed, may make possible a more minute study of the processes of early printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first fact revealed is that the center rule 2 does not bear to the box the same relation which the box maintains to the skeleton-forme: in other words, the center rule cannot be considered an integral part of the skeleton-forme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As an illustration I have made up a table for the various appearances of these center rules in the first six gatherings of Griffin's section (Section 5) of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evidence of this partial table shows clearly that because of the irregular occurrence of the center rules within the various skeletons and their boxes, no reliance in difficult cases may be placed upon center rules as a means of identifying the box-rules in which they are found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The irregular appearance of these rules requires explanation. When the printer came to impose the type-pages of a new forme, the box-rules enclosing the wrought-off type-pages would be transferred as an integral part of the skeleton; but on the evidence of the table, the center rule—in effect a part of the type-page itself—was not removed from the type-page until distribution of at least one column of type had been effected. The reason would appear to be fairly simple. To leave the center rule between the two columns is obviously an expedient to prevent the pieing which would almost certainly ensue if the rule were removed before the compositor was ready to distribute the type. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The recurrence of these center rules in different formes, however irregularly, indicates that the compositor found it a convenience to have on hand a supply of rules made up to the proper length. We should thus expect him to lay the center rule aside on the bench, once it had been freed from its type-page by the distribution of a column of letterpress. Hence, there is the possibility of estimating at least the maximum distribution period for a type-page by tracing the reappearance of its center rule in another forme. This evidence, of course, can never be completely exact. We have no reason to believe that a compositor would always pick up a center rule in the precise order in which it had been laid aside on the bench. Moreover it is necessary to inquire just when he would place the center rule between the columns of a newly-composed type-page. The answer is of some interest as revealing the precise way in which, on the evidence of Griffin's section, a large double-column type-page was composed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are two possibilities. First, after completing the first column of his page, the compositor might take a center rule from the bench, lay it in the page-galley against the type margin, and then proceed to set the second column, transferring type from his composing-stick until the two-column page-galley was complete. If he did so, he would have an uncomfortably large type-page to transfer, by means of his slice, from the page-galley to the composing-stone. That this operation was possible is shown by the various folios which are set in a single column of long lines, but there would seem to be little question that with a double-column page a single column of type would be easier to handle as a unit. For this reason we might expect a compositor to follow the second alternative and transfer the letterpress from his page-galley to the stone after he had completed only a single column. If he did so, he could then (a) place his center rule beside the column, or (b) insert it when the second column was composed and placed beside the first on the stone, or (c) there could be a delay until two completed type-pages were ready and were being imposed from the skeleton of a wrought-off forme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A study of gathering 5A indicates that, at least for this section of the folio, the compositor adopted the third method (c). When we follow him in the order of composition, we see that type-page 1 recto uses an unidentified rule, 1 verso rule 1, and 2 recto rule 2. But when on 2 verso we find rule 1 once more, it is clear that this rule can appear in these two pages only if it had been inserted as a part of the process of imposition. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this demonstration that the rule in question would be placed in a new type-page at the last possible moment, we can narrow our estimate of the spread in time between the moment when a rule becomes available by the distribution of at least one column of its type-page, and the time when the rule is employed again. In turn, this greater precision should enable us to estimate more accurately in these double-column folios the chronological relation between imposition and presswork on a new forme and distribution of the type-pages of a wrought-off forme. Clearly, the kind of evidence afforded by center rules must always be used to supplement and to check the evidence from running-titles and box-rules in any attempt to break down the precise method by which two presses printed a related series of sheets. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 R. C. Bald in his monograph, Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 (1938) and E. E. Willoughby's earlier study, The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1932) made extensive use of the evidence of box-rules to augment the information yielded by the various running-titles. The most recent study of this printing problem, the work of G. A. Battle, appears above in this present volume, supplementing his more extensive study which interestingly demonstrates that under certain conditions the box-rules are more trustworthy than running-titles to identify various skeleton-formes. See his "The Case of the Altered 'C'—A Bibliographical Problem in the Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XLII (1948), 66-70.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 For convenience I refer to a center "rule" even though actually a center rule is ordinarily composed of two, or more, short touching rules, one of which is generally longer than the other. The two rules can appear in all possible relations to each other; sometimes both rules are reversed so that the longer section appears at times above the shorter rule, and at other times below it; at other times the sections of the rules maintain the same linear relationship to each other, but are reversed in direction, thus preserving their identity, but rendering the task of following them through the various gatherings extremely exacting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 The boxes, which in effect represent the skeletons, are composed of two horizontal rules enclosing the running title, another horizontal rule at the bottom of the type-page which separates it from the tail of the page, and two vertical rules along the right and left margins of the type-page. There are two such boxes in each skeleton-forme; therefore, for the sake of clarity, we shall number each of the three skeleton-formes used in printing this section I, II, and III, further distinguishing the two halves with the letters a and b . Thus, the inner sheet of gathering 5A was printed with skeleton-forme II a -II b ; and the outer sheet of the same gathering was printed with skeleton-forme I a -I b . At times the boxes are reversed in position, as in the outer forme of the outer sheet of gathering 5E, which was perfected with skeleton-forme II b -II a . In the same manner are numbered the center rules, using arabic numerals, with α and β to distinguish the two touching sections of the rule.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 We may compare Moxon's description of the manner in which a forme is unlocked: "The Reason why he opens the Foot-Quoins first, is, because the Letter is less subject to Squabble between Line and Line (that is Head and Foot , the length of the Page ) than it is between side and side (the breadth of the Page) . . ." ( Mechanick Exercises , ed. De Vinne [1896], II, 202).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 If printing, as we must assume, is made from the inside out, forme 2 v .3 would have been the first on the press; hence the center rule from 1 v .4 (which will be the next-to-last forme of the gathering to be printed) would not be available for transfer to 2 verso if either (a) or (b) had obtained. Similarly, rule 2 can appear on 2 recto and 3 recto not if it is inserted at the moment of composition, but only at the time of imposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 Such a complete analysis still remains to be made of the difficult problem presented by the presswork in Griffin's section of the folio, which seems to have been printed with a second press irregularly assisting the press assigned to the job.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Textual Revision in Crashaw's "Vpon the Bleeding Crvcifix" George W. Williams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is commonly thought that Crashaw's religious lyrics "have only the structure that is given by the string in a rosary," 1 and thus lack the kind of careful, "articulated structure" 2 often achieved by George Herbert. However, Crashaw was, in fact, capable of this "articulated structure": an interesting example will be found in a comparison of the two versions of the poem entitled in 1646 "On the bleeding wounds of our crucified Lord," in 1648 "On the bleeding body of our crucified Lord," and in 1652 "Vpon the bleeding Crvcifix A Song." 3 The progressive change of name is significant. The emphasis has been shifted from the wounds through the body to the crucifix, and the key to the new structure has been suggested, for the poem has been made consciously cruciform in the later version. No major change has occurred in the thought of the poem, but the deceptively simple transposition in lines two and three of the first stanza and the consequential rearrangement of the order of the following four stanzas evidence a certain intention to provide the 1648 version with an articulated structure in keeping with the new name for the poem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An examination of the two versions of the first stanza reveals Crashaw's statement of the form in the second version. 1646: Iesu, no more, it is full: de From thy hands and from thy feet, From thy head, and from thy side, All thy Purple Rivers meet. 1648 and 1652: Iesu, no more! It is full tide. From thy head &amp; from thy feet, From thy hands &amp; from thy side All the purple Riuers meet. By the single interchange of "hands" and "head," the 1648 stanza immediately becomes cruciform. The second line, "head . . . feet," gives the vertical support, the third line, "hands", provides the crossbar. Furthermore, the words parallel the movement of the hand in making the sign of the cross.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The elaboration of this statement follows to build the articulated structure. In both versions each of the second through fifth stanzas deals with one of the wounds of the Christ. In the 1646 version these stanzas bear no formal relation to the order of the wounds in the opening statement. Thus, "hands . . . feet . . . head . . . side," the order in the first stanza, is expanded in the random manner: "feet . . . hand . . . side . . . head." 4 In the 1648 revision, however, Crashaw has so rearranged the order of the second through fifth stanzas that the statement of the theme is expanded identically in the stanzas. Thus, the order in the first stanza, "head . . . feet . . . hands . . . side," is reproduced in the same order in the stanzas: "head . . . feet . . . hands . . . side." 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is evident that this is no casual rearrangement, but that Crashaw is consciously revising to create a cruciform poem which outlines a small crucifix in the opening lines and proceeds to enlarge the picture in the body of the poem.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">2 A term originated by G. H. Palmer in an essay, "The Style," prefacing his edition of The English Poems of George Herbert , I, 139-140, to describe the kind of structure which results from the conscious desire of the poet to make the form of the poem reproduce the movement of the thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 The Poems English Latin and Greek of Richard Crashaw , ed. L. C. Martin, pp. 101, 288.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 The presence of the singular word "hand" in the first line of the stanza (1646) indicates that Crashaw was not thinking in terms of a formal crucifix since both hands are obviously needed to form the cross bar. In the 1648 version the word is significantly plural.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 The concluding four stanzas in both versions indicate the more typical Crashavian structure. A progression in size may be noted: "river, rivers, [flood], deluge."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Hallam-Tennyson POEMS (1830) Mary Virginia Bowman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical (1830) was originally intended as part of a joint publication to include the poems of his college friend, Arthur Hallam, but when Hallam's father objected to the project it was abandoned and Tennyson published separately his section of the proposed collection. Parental objection to the publication of Hallam's poems had not been made, however, until type-setting had been completed. Hence Hallam ordered some copies of his own section to be run off for private distribution among his family and friends. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The obscurity of Hallam's book of poems in this privately issued form has given rise to two major misconceptions. The first—that only two copies have survived—was clarified in 1941 when T. H. Vail Motter made a census listing the details of fifteen known copies. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A second misconception—that at least one copy of the originally intended joint collection actually survives—still remains to be considered. This error was given credence by Hugh I'Anson Fausset in his biography of Tennyson (1923). After commenting that Hallam's idea of a public collaboration with Tennyson was abandoned only when the volume had actually been put into type, Fausset made the flat statement, "A copy of it exists today." 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This odd statement seems to go back to an unsigned report in The Bookworm , a London publication in January, 1894 (VII, 48) which describes the sale at Sotheby's of a copy of the two sections bound together. After explaining the original intention of a joint production, the article continues, "and no copy of the complete book has hitherto occurred for sale. In the copy in question, however, Hallam's poems are included." Such a statement could be read to mean a surviving copy of the originally intended publication, or The Bookworm may have meant only that this copy is in the form originally planned. The first reading seems more probable, however, in the light of the statement further on: "Some partially erased pencil notes . . . render it probable that the volume is a unique proof copy belonging to Hallam himself." There is nothing in the context of this passage to indicate The Bookworm remarks are directed at Hallam's section alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The confusion seems to be based on the assumption (now known to be false) that no copies of Hallam's Poems had survived the non imprimatur . Therefore, since this volume was in existence, it was explained as a proof copy of the originally intended publication. The ghost raised by Fausset from this shadowy evidence remains to be laid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The copy described in The Bookworm (no. 8 in Motter's census which refers to the 1925 sale, the volume having eluded him thereafter) was auctioned at Sotheby's in December, 1893, where—according to Book Prices Current 1894 —it was bought by the bookseller Pearson. 4 It appeared on the market again in a sale at the Anderson Galleries, New York, in December, 1925 (Sale Catalogue no. 2007, item 291), and once more in December, 1933, at the Ritter-Hopson sale of the James M. Kennedy collection, where it was purchased by Tracy W. McGregor of Detroit. After his death in 1936, the book was bequeathed as a part of his collection to the University of Virginia, where it is now preserved in the McGregor Library. That this is the volume referred to by The Bookworm writer is sufficiently demonstrated by its exact correspondence to his description, including the partially erased pencil notes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This book is bound in calf (as described in 1894), with "TENNYSON'S POEMS" lettered on the spine. It begins with Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical (1830), 154 pages, page 91 misnumbered 19, with "carcanet" on p. 72. The final leaf of advertisements has been removed. Hallam's Poems , 174 pages, follow directly, without the preliminary two-leaf fold containing a blank and the half-title, and without the final blank. At the top of page 1 is inked in a printing hand "Poems | by | Arthur Hallam Esq r ." Presumably the same hand (although in the nature of things this cannot be certain) has also printed on Tennyson's title-page beneath Tennyson's name "&amp; | ARTHUR HALLAM." At the top right hand corner of Tennyson's title in a different hand is written "E.H.F. from Aunt Julia | March 1859."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Throughout the book, both in the Tennyson and in the Hallam sections, are found pencil annotations (most of them partially or completely erased). These are written in what seem to be three hands, all of which are different from the Aunt Julia inscription. The first hand is confined to the written identifications under the titles of three poems in Hallam's section, as "Sir F. A. Doyle", which have not been erased. On the errata page of Tennyson's part is inscribed in what is probably a different hand "To | Edith Hamilton Forsyth", which has been erased but can be read in an infra-red photograph. This writing is somewhat similar to the hand that wrote the identifications, but the inscription is much smaller. Owing to the small amount of the writing it is impossible to make a positive decision, but the two are probably unlike. It is certain, however, that a still different hand has made a number of pencil comments on various poems in both sections, all of them more or less thoroughly erased although some are still readable either by infra-red photographs or by an occasional convenient offset. A sample is the remark on p. 157 of Hallam's section, "I think this would be pleasing if it were intelligible." On p. 5 of Tennyson's Poems the writer has copied in quotation marks the next to the last line of the poem "Like a roseleaf I will crush thee" and has drawn two sets of roseleaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unique interest is given to these annotations by the tradition which has grown up that this is a Hallam family copy. The Bookworm writer insinuates that these notes are by Arthur Hallam ("Some partially erased pencil notes . . . render it probable that the volume is a unique proof copy belonging to Hallam himself."). Later sales catalogue descriptions of the book ascribe the pencil notes as well as the additions on the title-page to Henry Hallam and identify Aunt Julia in the inscription "E.H.F. from Aunt Julia" as Hallam's sister, Julia, who, according to the fiction, passed the book on to a descendent after Henry Hallam's death in 1859. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The source of this belief is unknown. It is probably based mostly on wishful thinking, although possibly it is also related to the erroneous concept that this was the only copy of the Hallam Poems in existence, which made it seem very probable that the book was Arthur Hallam's own copy, kept by his father after Arthur's death in 1833. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, the identification of the inscription handwriting as that of Julia Hallam seems most unlikely in the face of the evidence of the bookplate, within the front cover, of John Edwardes Lyall (born 1811 and died 1845), who is apparently the son of George Lyall and Margaret Ann Edwardes. The evidence of his name is corroborated by the fact that he married a Julia Davis, with his sister marrying in 1843 a William Forsyth. Moreover, it is possible to establish the fact that Lyall and Arthur Hallam were acquainted, and presumably friends. The two attended Eton together and were fellow members in the small Eton Society, where they must have become intimate. 7 Thus it is perfectly natural for Lyall to have been the recipient of a copy of his poems from Hallam, or just possibly from his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This book, in its present form except for the binding, must have come into the possession of John Edwardes Lyall early in its history, for he died in 1845 after having been made Advocate General of Bengal in 1842. It is improbable that his bookplate would have been inserted in a book after his death, and since the plate is pasted in the present binding, this makes the combination of the Hallam and Tennyson poems prior to 1845, and almost certainly prior to 1842. The binding, although preserved in a slip-case since 1894, is somewhat loose and shows signs of considerable wear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In connection with this question of the date at which the Hallam and Tennyson parts were brought together, one group of the pencil annotations has a very considerable significance. These are the partially erased annotations in the same hand commenting on the poems in both sections. In the process of binding the present volume, some of the final letters of this set have been shaved off, thus establishing the writing of these particular annotations, at least, as prior to the present calf binding, which itself is to be dated as prior to 1842. 8 So far as can be determined from the relatively small amount of writing preserved, the hand that wrote these pencil comments on various Tennyson and Hallam poems bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Arthur Hallam. 9 In these circumstances, there is nothing to prevent the hypothesis that Arthur wrote in these two parts already sewn together and then presented them to an Eton (and perhaps Inner Temple) classmate; or else, just possibly, after his son's death Henry Hallam may have sent the volume to a friend, Lyall. Moreover, the comments themselves show such a close interest in the poems as to be more likely those of the author than those of a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus, there seem to be two alternatives. If the handwriting is authentically Arthur Hallam's, then this is a presentation copy of the two associated sections made by him, or by his father, to a friend. Or, if the handwriting is that of an unknown person, the book is a made up combination such as could have been done by any individual at any time by combining the two first editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is no justification for the statement that this is a proof copy, for it is not on the paper that would have been used for a proof (the paper seems to be the same as that used in the other first edition of Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical in the McGregor Library). Moreover the pencil annotations which can be deciphered are not the sort of notes made when reading proof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor is there any justification for assuming that this is a copy of a published book in collected form. Those who believed in an actually published copy of the two sections can have had in mind only one of three possible forms: (1) A collection in which the original plan was to sign and page the sheets of the two sections consecutively, not separately as found at present. (2) A "publisher's" title-page replacing either Tennyson's present title-page or Hallam's half-title. (3) A collection which simply binds the two parts as we know them now; in other words, a replica of the McGregor volume but possibly containing the Hallam half-title and very likely cancelling the Tennyson advertisement leaf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first is based on what is probably a false assumption. 10 A collection such as the two young men were contemplating would quite naturally be separately signed and paged in its two parts in order that separate issue of some copies could be made if required. To believe that any other form existed, impressed on paper, than is known from the present separate examples of each part is to believe that some sheets of Hallam's part were actually printed consecutively signed and paged with Tennyson's, and then the type-pages were altered for Hallam's private printing. This is an absurdity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The writer of The Bookworm account seems to waver between the second or third possibilities, although he is not overly clear in the matter. The second would require the present Tennyson title-leaf, and possibly the Hallam half-title, to be a cancellans, for which there is no evidence. 11 As for the third possibility, any binding of the two parts together in their present form is by no means—as Fausset hastily took it—proof of collected publication. Any private person could perform this operation, and indeed there is a record that one did. 12 In fact, however, no bound-together copies, except for the McGregor volume, are known to exist today.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To conclude, the tracing of the history of the McGregor volume back to the Sotheby sale in 1893 and its establishment as the collected volume described by the writer of The Bookworm article demonstrates that, whatever interpretation is placed on his comments in 1894, there is nothing in this book which under any circumstances could lead to a belief, as with Fausett, that a copy of the originally intended collection was ever in existence. The McGregor collection is the unique example of what seems to be a fairly well authenticated joint binding; yet, at best, it can be shown only to have been put together from two separate parts, either by Hallam himself or by Lyall, in what we may suppose is substantially the form the proposed joint publication would have taken with the exception of a general title naming the two authors (never printed) and the doubtful matter of whether the half-title is missing here by design or by accident.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 The above is the accepted account and doubtless approximates the actual facts, although precise evidence is lacking. For example, it seems to be only an assumption that Hallam's poems were still in type and had not been printed though as yet unpublished when his father disrupted the plan. The present makeup of his section presents no bibliographical evidence either in favor of or against a form privately printed for personal distribution. That the typesetting had been well advanced, if not completed, is presumably demonstrated by the simple fact that copies were struck off; also a footnote on p. 62 refers to "my friend, whose name is prefixed with mine to this volume." Although the retention of this last could have been an oversight, the only real question is whether Hallam had a few copies privately printed or whether he took as many already printed sheets as he required and had the rest destroyed. If Tennyson's section had been planned as the start of the volume, then we must believe the first; if Hallam's were to come initially, then the advertisement leaf concluding Tennyson's Poems is not evidence. The proposed order of the two parts is not known. Possibly the appearance in both sections of the printer's imprint is evidence in favor of only the private printing.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">5 Arthur Hallam's sister Julia was married in February, 1852, and died in July, 1888. Aunt Julia cannot be Henry Hallam's wife, Julia, since she died in the 1840's. However, she was the daughter of Sir Abraham Elton, Bart., one of whose sons, Henry, married Mary Ford and produced a daughter Julia. Charles Abraham Elton, who succeeded to his father, married Sara Smith and among their numerous children was a daughter Julia. There are no Forsyth connections in the immediate Hallam family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 The usual statement, repeated in all the booksellers' catalogues, reads, "That this was Hallam's own copy is attested by the fact that it is the only copy in existence, by the intimate knowledge of the author's friendships betrayed in the MS notes, and by the inscription on the title-page in the autograph of Hallam's sister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7 The Eton Society was founded in 1811 by Charles Fox Townshend and became an exclusive social club and debating society. At first the members were known as the "Literati," but eventually the club acquired the less dignified name of "Pop." The number of the members was originally restricted to twenty but was soon raised to thirty. See M. Zamick, "Unpublished Letters of Arthur Henry Hallam from Eton, now in the John Rylands Library," Bulletin of The John Rylands Library (Jan., 1934), pp. 197-202; and also H. C. Maxwell-Lyte, A History of Eton College 1440-1884 (London, 1889), pp. 373-76. Although Hallam attended Trinity College Cambridge, and Lyall attended Balliol College Oxford, both subsequently entered the Inner Temple. The date when Lyall was admitted to the Temple cannot be ascertained from records available in this country, but if he entered (as did Hallam) immediately after graduation from the university, the two would have renewed their acquaintance shortly before Hallam's death. It is of some interest that Lyall's cousin, Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, was a close friend of Tennyson and wrote a biography of the poet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 The history of this volume must be taken as controverting the theory that the ink inscription in 1859 from Aunt Julia to E. H. F. has any connection with Arthur Hallam's sister, Julia. Although from the records available in this country it cannot be established that Edith Hamilton Forsyth was the daughter of Lyall's sister who married William Forsyth, it is most probable that Lyall's wife, Julia, gave the volume to her niece by marriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9 I am indebted for the following opinion to Mr. F. L. Berkeley, Jr., Curator of Manuscripts at the Alderman Library, University of Virginia, who compared the writing with photostats of Hallam letters kindly furnished by The Pierpont Morgan Library. He feels that, "the penciled marginalia in this copy of Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical (London, 1830; bound with Hallam's poems) have been too well erased to permit positive identification of the writer. It can be said, negatively, that the notes (which were made before the book was bound and trimmed) are not in the hand of Henry Hallam. The formation of those letters that can be clearly distinguished does bear a striking resemblance to the hand of Arthur Hallam. On the other hand, the three names, identifying persons to whom poems are dedicated, are not in the hand of Arthur Hallam, and do bear a considerable resemblance to the less distinctive writing of Henry Hallam, the historian. The words on the errata leaf, 'To Edith Hamilton Forsyth', appear to have been written by a third person, certainly not by Arthur Hallam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10 Motter's words, not being bibliographically precise, might seem to give some encouragement to this view: "Hallam's father at the last minute, and when the poems were already in type, forbade the joint publication. The printers, Littlewood and Company, Old Bailey, separated Hallam's fifty titles from Tennyson's fifty-five, and assembled a certain number of copies of Hallam's, which Hallam then quietly presented to his friends." op. cit. , p. 277. Actually, Motter does not believe in any form of collected publication, and is speaking only of the makeup that Hallam's section took separately. Yet if the poems were already in type, the separate signing and paging had already been effected as a part of putting the type into page-galley form, and since the text of Hallam's poems began with the first leaf of a separately signed series of gatherings, there would have been no "separation" of the type-pages for printing, unless Motter is implying only that the printing of the Tennyson and Hallam sections was accomplished at two different times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11 Or, conversely, a "publisher's" title for the collection as a cancellans for the present titles. Both parts are bound in 12's, with the final gathering of Tennyson's Poems a regular quire in 10's, leading to the belief that the fold containing his title-leaf and the errata leaf was printed, as normally, as a part of the final gathering, which concludes with an advertisement leaf. Of course, if a general title for the collection had already been set up in type before the decision was made to drop this form of publication, the present Tennyson title would have been composed and substituted before printing. Any attempt to link the fact that the first text gathering in the Tennyson Poems is in 8's instead of 12's with possible re-imposition to exclude preliminaries for the collection would ignore the significance of the final gathering in 10's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">12 A volume containing Hallam's poems followed by Tennyson's and inscribed "W. Donne from the Author, May 26th, 1830" was owned by W. B. Donne, the Examiner of Plays and a Cambridge friend of Tennyson and Hallam. It was purchased about 1884 by Colonel W. F. Prideaux, who has stated that Donne himself bound the poems of the two authors together in order to carry out, in a way, the original intentions of the poets. This copy eventually came into the possession of T.J. Wise, who separated the two parts and sold the Tennyson. See Motter, op. cit. , p. 280 and nn.

      <field name="heading_text">Running-Title Evidence for Determining Half-Sheet Imposition Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographers generally have assumed that preliminaries or cancellanda of a book would be printed economically as part of the final text gathering (or vice versa ) when space permitted. Under ordinary circumstances this may surely be taken as a reasonable hypothesis, but—it should be noticed—only when the two sections are of an unequal number of leaves. In a duodecimo collating i 4 A-N 12 O 8 , as in all the later duodecimos of Sandys's translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses except for the 1690 edition, gathering i 4 would surely be printed as the cut-off of the sheet with gathering O. Correspondingly, such formulas as 4 0 , A 4 (—A 4 ) B-G 4 H 4 (H4+1[=A4?]) for Dryden's Wild Gallant (1684), and A 1[=O4?] B-N 4 O 4 (—O4) for the anonymous Feign'd Astrologer (1668) probably represent the actual facts of printing. Often the physical evidence of a wrap-around in an unrebound copy, or else aberrant binding, will demonstrate the fact for single leaves. Thus, interestingly, the precise formula for Pordage's Herod and Mariamne (1673) as A 4 (-A1) B-H 4 I 4 (I4+1[=A1]) is proved by the aberrant Library of Congress copy of the 1674 re-issue in which the prologue leaf A4 is found bound at the end and conjugate with the epilogue leaf I4+1, the two obviously having been printed as A1.4 but the binder in this copy transferring the outer fold in error instead of only the initial leaf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, such printing was not invariable, and there are some dangers in assuming it unless positive evidence is found. For instance, if one hunts long enough, one will find the blank initial leaf, as in the Harvard copy, of Behn's Forc'd Marriage (1671), which demonstrates that the actual formula for the book is 4 0 , A 4 B-L 4 M 4 (M4+1), with sig. A1 blank and genuine and therefore not used to print sig. M4+1. Correspondingly, in the 1615 folio of Sandys's Relation of a Journey , the final blank in the last gathering 2D 6 is sometimes preserved to indicate that the single-leaf dedication A 1 was not printed there as one might otherwise have expected. Nevertheless, when careful search in a large number of copies fails to turn up such blanks, the natural inference in certain conditions is that the blanks never existed for the simple reason that they were used to print other leaves in the book. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cases mentioned above have concerned the major probability that two sections of a book—one major and one minor—would ordinarily be printed together for economy on one sheet. It is also generally assumed that when a preliminary and the final text gathering each consists of only half a sheet, the two would be printed together. For example, in a quarto collating A 2 B-L 4 M 2 , the usual assumption is that A(i) and M(i) would be imposed together for printing as one forme, and—after being perfected by A(o) and M(o) imposed together as another forme—the two halves of the sheet would be cut apart to form a single copy of each gathering. In my opinion this is a dubious assumption, and I suspect that as often as not each was separately imposed and printed by half-sheet imposition, the four type-pages of A in one forme and the four of M in another. The evidence of watermarks has frequently been taken as bearing on this question: if in such a book A 2 , for instance, contained a watermark and M 2 none, the case was considered demonstrated that the two were printed together. Again in my opinion, for reasons too complex for inquiry here, this watermark evidence is frequently untrustworthy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is my purpose in this note to suggest a form of truly bibliographical evidence which can be utilized with confidence under certain conditions to determine precisely whether two half-sheets were printed together or separately. (This question is not altogether one of idle curiosity: textual considerations may enter in such a connection.) Since evidence is drawn from the running-titles, one must have a book in which running-titles are present on at least one page each of the outer and inner formes of the half-sheet text gathering under examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Given this common condition, the evidence is very simple. If the running-titles from only one forme used to print a preceding full sheet of the text are found in both formes of the text half-sheet, then this half-sheet was printed by itself by half-sheet imposition. (The order of the titles is important, as will be seen: for a readily determined exception to this generalization, see footnote 2 below.) To demonstrate this fact, all one needs to do is mentally to transfer the quarters (as in a quarto) from a skeleton forme and impose them in the same relative positions about the four type-pages imposed for half-sheet printing. For instance, if the skeleton of inner L is being transferred to half-sheet M, the running-title of L1 v should go to M1 v , L2 to M1, L4 to M2, and L3 v to M2 v . If, in such a book, A (without running-titles) and M were imposed together, inner with inner in one forme and outer with outer in another, the running-titles from certain of the quarters of inner L would be found in the same order as above (depending on the position in the (AM) sheet of the two halves): L1 v to M1 v and L4 to M2, or the corresponding quarters of the other half of the skeleton. But, when the skeleton of the outer forme of L was transferred to the outer (AM) forme, L4 v would go probably to M2 v and L1 to M1, or the corresponding quarters. Thus running-titles from both inner and outer L would necessarily be found in half-sheet M in a manner impossible if M had been printed by half-sheet imposition and the full sheet cut apart to make two copies of the same gathering. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a practical demonstration, we may take the second edition of Caryll's Sir Salomon , which appeared in 1691 with the collation 4 0 , A 2 B-I 4 K 2 . Here the skeleton of inner H was used to impose the four type-pages of K 2 , and hence one may prove that K 2 was printed alone by half-sheet imposition. In this case the forme of H(i) was turned on the bench before re-imposition (a fairly frequent occurrence of no significance), so that the running-title of H4 appears on K1, that of H3 v on K1 v , and that of H2 on K2 (K2 v has no title). A more conventional case is the anonymous Knavery in All Trades (1664), with the collation 4 0 , A 2 B-E 4 F 2 . When we find the running-title of E1 v going to F1 v , E2 to F1, E3 v to F2 v , and E4 to F2, we can demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that—as with Sir Salomon —the final half-sheet was printed by itself and not imposed together with the preliminary half-sheet to the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why one method would be adopted instead of another is rather puzzling. In books like the Sandys Relation of a Journey and the Behn Forc'd Marriage where blanks were not utilized to print a necessary single leaf, we may perhaps infer that in each case there was a delay between the printing of the final text and the composition of the preliminaries, so that the printer decided to go ahead without waiting to determine whether the material could be imposed together. This hypothesis will not hold with the second edition of Sir Salomon , printed twenty years after the first. So far as I can see, there is no difference in efficiency in presswork in printing A and M together or else separately by half-sheet imposition (except possibly for more offset of wet ink on the tympan cloth in the latter case), and my observation in the later seventeenth-century quartos has been that, if anything, the separate half-sheet imposition method was perhaps more common. For this reason, bibliographers should, I think, make a running-title analysis whenever conditions permit before assuming that two half-sheets of text and preliminaries were in fact printed together on one sheet and then cut apart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 Even after a prolonged search, such printing can remain only inferential, however, unless an aberrant copy discloses the actual fact of imposition and printing. For instance, in attempting to establish the true formula for the first gathering of Sandys's 1632 folio Ovid , I examined or had reported over 25 copies before a unique copy turned up containing the initial blank leaf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 A complication would ensue if A 2 and M 2 were imposed inner with inner, and then the same skeleton were used to impose the outer formes of each half-sheet for perfecting. But this could easily be detected and the fact demonstrated by the appearance of the identical running-title of M1 v on M2 v and of M2 on M1, an impossibility if the four type-pages of M had been imposed together in one forme. (The possibility is too remote to consider that the running-titles originally removed from the skeleton in the half used to print the inner forme of A would be substituted for those already present for M in the skeleton of inner (AM) when the outer forme was imposed for perfecting.)</field>
