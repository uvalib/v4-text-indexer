      <field name="heading_text">Towards a Critical Text of James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man by Hans Walter Gabler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , the book which James Joyce had been writing for ten years since embarking upon it in Dublin in 1904, was completed in manuscript in Trieste in 1914. Fifty years later, in 1964, the Viking Press published a "definitive text, corrected from the Dublin holograph." 1 Though not critical, and although presenting a text which even the scholar who prepared it does not consider to be truly definitive, this edition of the novel represents the first attempt ever made to relate its printed versions back to the authorial manuscript. For the first time also—though not published with the text—an account appeared of the textual history of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man from the manuscript of 1913/14 to the Jonathan Cape edition of 1924, the last in which the author himself had a hand. 2 Some problems of the text and of its transmission have there been recognised and solved. The presence of others has not been noticed and sometimes not even suspected. Nor has all available documentary material relating to the textual history of the novel as yet been recorded. In this article, therefore, I propose first to describe and interpret three documents from British libraries, all preserved by Harriet Shaw Weaver and in 1951 and 1952 given by her to the British Museum and to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, which clarify essential stages of the publishing history and the transmission of the text, and then to discuss the central issues of an over-all textual hypothesis which would form the basis of editorial decision for a true critical edition of the novel. The Egoist Tearsheets The first printed text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was serialized in The Egoist , London, in 1914 and 1915. Tearsheets from The Egoist were in 1915 and 1916 circulated in the sustained, though long unsuccessful, efforts of James B. Pinker, literary agent, of Ezra Pound and above all Harriet Shaw Weaver to find an English publisher—and later, when the firm of The Egoist Ltd. had been founded for the very purpose of publishing A Portrait , to find a printer in England willing to take on the novel in book form. The search 3 ended only when B. W. Huebsch of New York undertook both to publish A Portrait in the United States and to supply The Egoist Ltd. with the sheets for 750 copies 4 which became the first book edition published in England. 5 In its course, successive lots of tearsheets of the serialised Egoist printing were sent across the Atlantic, corrected and uncorrected, and in complete sets of the text as well as in units of two or three chapters. What has survived of these several dispatches to America now forms three separate complete sets of tearsheets in the Slocum Collection at Yale University. 6 One of them—EC-A—gains its integrity as a set from having served as the printer's copy for the Huebsch edition (H). The library of the British Museum in London holds a fourth set of tearsheets. It came to the British Museum from the possession of Harriet Shaw Weaver in October 1951. Following Anderson's sigla I shall call it EC-W. This set does not enter the transmission of the text of A Portrait beyond the Egoist serialisation, but it clarifies some aspects of the transfer into print of the typescript, which itself is largely lost, by providing evidence that none of the censoring cuts which affect the Egoist text in its published form were made until the last moment before publication. In its substantive readings Joyce's text was set up as unimpaired as the typescript transmitted it by the compositors of all three printers employed by The Egoist during the serialisation of the novel. The EC-W tearsheets prove that printinghouse editors must be held responsible for the cuts. 7 EC-W contains as an insert the left column of a page-proof of p. 289 ( The Egoist , Aug. 1, 1914) which begins Chapter III of the novel. It has the entire five-paragraph passage in print which is then seen to have been removed from the subsequent published version of the full page. A short poem, spaced widely so that it corresponds in length to the excised Portrait passage, seems to have been inserted as a filler where the August 1 installment ends at the bottom of the left-hand column on page 291. Similarly, after the published version of p. 128 of The Egoist , August 2nd, 1915, part of a galley proofsheet is inserted which corresponds to a large section of the text found on p. 128, second column, and p. 129, first column, and contains in print both the brief piece of dialogue censored in publication and the twice-repeated word 'ballocks' subsequently replaced by asterisks. Of particular interest in EC-W, moreover, is the fact that all of Chapter IV is in galley-proof. Herein also the two sentences near the end of the chapter which to Joyce's recorded dismay 8 had disappeared from the published text are found in print. Their removal caused some respacing and resetting of lines and indeed introduced one new substantive error in the published Egoist text. Further collation shows that the galley-proofs of Chapter IV are wholly uncorrected and that, while their correction before publication removed many printer's errors, it also introduced new errors into the text. EC-W, Harriet Weaver's set of tear- and proofsheets of the Egoist serialisation of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , is now bound in hard covers in a volume of 60 leaves which but for three exceptions—fols. 3-4, 5-6 and 30-31 being conjugate—are separately mounted. The binding was done after the set's accession to the British Museum, and there are signs that before binding it consisted of three, or rather four, individual parts. The text itself came in three separate bundles, with Chapters I and II each by itself, and Chapters III, IV, and V together in a brown paper folder. The British Museum shelfmark is pencilled on each first leaf of these three sections. Because of a bookbinder's decision, moreover, one leaf and two once-folded sheets of errata to Chapters III and IV (with one single erratum for Chapter V) in Joyce's own hand must now be regarded as the fourth section of the set. These manuscript errata lists, although never an integral part of the set of tear- and proofsheets, once accompanied it in a green envelope, as is stated in a note in Miss Weaver's hand on the brown paper folder to Chapters III-V. After binding, the volume as a whole may now be described as follows: On fol. 1 v the Egoist text begins as page 50 of The Egoist of February 2nd, 1914. This first tearsheet is backed by a pasted-on sheet of white paper, now smudged and grey, which serves as a title-page. On it is written in green crayon between rules in green crayon: 'A Portrait of the Artist | as a Young Man'; the roman numeral I is centered in parantheses —also in green crayon—under the lower rule. The writing is probably Joyce's own. In the bottom left-hand corner are three notes in pencil in Harriet Weaver's hand: 'Prepared by Mr Joyce', 'No corrections here H.S.W.' and 'Nor have I a copy of those of first two chapters'. In the bottom right-hand corner is affixed a printed business card reading: 'It is requested that all communications respecting this M.S. be addressed to — James B. Pinker, Literary Agent, Talbot House, Arundel Street Strand, London [—] Folio'. The name and address 'James B. Pinker . . . London' have been struck out in pencil and replaced by the pencilled address in Miss Weaver's hand: 'The Egoist Oakley House, Bloomsbury St. London W.C.' Fols. 2-6 of the bound volume are the manuscript errata lists referred to above, evidently misplaced by the binder in being inserted here. Fol. 2 is a single leaf and is virtually blank but for the three lines written at the top of its recto: ' Errata | "Egoist." 1/ix/914: p. 330, col. 2, par 8, l 2: delete "of herrings" | "Egoist" 1/vi/915: p. 95, col. 2 par. 4, l. 14: for "immediate" read "mediate".' 9 Fols. 3-6 are two oncefolded ruled foolscap sheets with four pages each of manuscript corrections to Chapters III and IV. Fol. 3 r is headed 'Chapter III', fol. 5 r is headed 'Chapter IV' in Joyce's hand. To the left and right of the heading 'Chapter III' are additional notes in pencil and probably in Harriet Weaver's hand (all of Joyce's writing being in ink): '[Pages are those of The Egoist ]' and ' A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Corrections to Egoist'. Vertical rules in ink divide columns for 'Page | Paragraph | Line | Column | Incorrect | Correct' in the corrections to Chapter III and '. . . . | Column | Line | . . . .' in those to Chapter IV. Fols. 7-16 are the Egoist tearsheets of Chapter I; fols. 18-26 those of Chapter II. In the upper outside corners of fols. 18-26 recto and verso the arabic numbers 1-18 have been written in pencil and been partly cropped. The asterisked divisions between the subsections of both chapters have been underscored, or scored out, in green crayon. In both chapters also all columns and part-columns of Egoist text not belonging to A Portrait have been pasted over with strips of white paper; whole pages have sometimes been pasted together and sometimes been backed with white paper for the same purpose of obliterating extraneous matter. Fols. 17 and 27 are the front and back covers of Chapter II. 17 v and 27 r+v are blank. On 17 r the inscription, in green crayon, 'A Portrait of the Artist | as a Young Man | (II)' is in the same hand as that on the title-page for Chapter I. In pencil, at the bottom of the page, are again the following notes by Harriet Weaver: 'Prepared by Mr. Joyce'; 'No corrections here.—H.S.W.' and 'Nor have I copy of those of first two chapters—H.S.W.' These cover leaves deserve special attention, and I shall return to them below. Fols. 28 and 60, again blank but for the inscription on fol. 28 r , are of brown paper and were in all probability once conjugate as a folder holding the tear- and proofsheets of Chapters III-V and, in addition, the green envelope with the manuscript corrections to Chapters III and IV. Fol. 28 r is inscribed in faded black ink: 'A Portrait of the Artist | as a Young Man. | Chapters III,IV.V' in what looks like the same hand as that writing the pencilled notes over the manuscript corrections to Chapter III (fol. 3 r ) and was in all probability Harriet Weaver's. Added after the roman numeral V in black unfaded ink, and definitely by Harriet Weaver, is: 'from | The Egoist. see Mr. Joyce's corrections to | chapters III+IV in green envelope'. Fol. 29 r consists of the left column only of a page-proof of the first page of the Egoist installment for August 1, 1914, and contains in print, as described above, the five-paragraph passage from near the beginning of Chapter III which was cut from the published text. The passage, having once been crossed out in pencil, but with the pencil strokes erased, is boxed in orange crayon. Words from a pencilled marginal note only partly legible can be made out as 'Censored, . . . does not appear in . . . Egoist of Aug 1'. Another marginal note in ink between orange crayon lines reads, amusingly: 'This paragraph which was deleted by the prinsters [sic] is to be inserted as marked'. The marking referred to is made in the appropriate place in the margin of fol. 30 r . Fol. 29 v is blank. The Egoist text of Chapter III occupies fols. 30-36. All extraneous matter is here simply crossed out in pencil and/or orange crayon. An orange crayon note at the bottom of fol. 36 v gives the direction: 'go to Chap. IV'. Fols. 37-42 contain Chapter IV in galley-proof, in seven long columns which, except for fol. 42 with columns 'SIX' and 'SEVEN', are printed one to a galley. Each galley, about twice the length of an Egoist page, is folded over once and bound into the present volume for the length of its bottom half only. All versos of the galleys are of course blank. Fol. 42 contains in each of its columns one of the two sentences later censored. They are both underscored and marked in orange crayon. Written in orange crayon between the columns is the note 'deleted by printers [illegible name in parenthesis]'. The bracketed illegible name is crossed out in black ink, and beneath, with an arrow to 'printers', the name is given as 'Messrs Jas. Truscott + Son'. 10 Fols. 43-59 are the Egoist tearsheets of Chapter V, with all extraneous matter crossed out in blue crayon. Interleaved as fol. 55 is the section of a galley-proof containing in print the censored passages from Chapter V, as already described. This galley, moreover, also has proof-corrections in thin black ink, objecting to the inking of spaces, to broken letters and to spacings between the regular punctuation and the dashes Joyce used instead of inverted commas to set off direct speech. The corrections have been made in the published Egoist text. Later than the proof-corrections is the crossing out in blue crayon of most of the text in this galley, leaving only the censored lines circled in black ink, with the marginal note 'these lines were deleted by printers—to be inserted as in original text'. The corresponding note for the place of insertion is to be found in the right-hand margin of fol. 54 v . Further down in the galley, the two instances of 'ballocks' are underscored in blue crayon, and blue crayon crosses are set against all three textual corrections to be made. Fol. 55 v is blank, and in the left margin of fol. 56 r the word 'ballocks' is again twice written in in black ink. Seen as a whole, EC-W contains three further sets of markings which should be recorded. In Chapters I-IV, there are two partly concurrent sets of line-counts. One of them is in short marginal strokes in thin black ink marking every hundredth line of printed text. Starting afresh at the beginning of each chapter, it is almost faultlessly accurate; but it is also purely mechanical, as is shown by the count for Chapter III which begins in the column of page-proof and runs on into the first column of the published text without allowing for the repetition here of lines already counted. The other set, which is present in Chapters I, II and IV only, is in pencil. In Chapters II and IV it, too, marks off roughly every hundredth line, though it is less accurate and usually deviates by several lines from the line-count in ink. In Chapter I the corresponding divisions in pencil fluctuate between 82 and 151 lines in length. In each of the chapters where they appear the pencilled divisions are serially numbered. In Chapter I and II, there are also a few accompanying additions of figures to be found in the margins. In Chapter V there are no line-counts. The tearsheets for this last chapter, however, are the only ones to show a few traces of correction beyond the restoring of censored passages. On fol. 43 v , a pencilled marginal note specifies 'dashes all through not inverted commas'; on fol. 46 r the twice-repeated misprint 'Epitectus' is each time corrected to 'Epictetus', and in close to 20 instances spread over several pages 'aesthetic' is corrected to 'esthetic' in accordance with Joyce's orthography. Finally, there are throughout the text marginal markings in pencil and indelible pencil which draw attention to a series of apparently undesirable passages of text. None of the restitutions of Egoist censorings are so marked, but there is a clear connection between all the markings in pencil in that they note passages which have to do with urine and excrement—beginning, indeed, on the first page with the sentence "When you wet the bed, first it is warm then it gets cold."—or else might be considered to have a blasphemous ring to them. 11 The markings in indelible pencil, present towards the end of Chapter II and in Chapter III only, stand against two instances of Stephen's sexual phantasies. 12 Fols. 17 and 27, the front and back covers of Chapter II, give the initial clue to the interpretation of the evidence set out above. The tearsheets for the first two chapters, as was seen, are separately claimed to have been prepared, with the careful pastings and markings in green crayon described, by James Joyce himself. Corroborative evidence that Harriet Weaver's repeated statement to this effect means what it says comes from the nature of the covers. On closer inspection, they prove to be the two halves of a broadsheet-size thin white cardboard with printed text in Italian which has been pasted over with white paper. 13 Against the light, the entire text of the two halves put together, though cropped at the top, is clearly legible as four columns of print setting out the rights and duties of tenants of apartment houses: when to pay rent; the duty of heads of families to provide separate bedrooms for children of different sexes over the age of six; strictures on sub-letting, on keeping pets, etc., etc. The text ends in one line of type across the bottom of the four columns: 'Il presente Regolamento venne approvato dalla G[iu]nta municipale, nella seduta del 6 Febbraio 1912.' and is signed 'IL CONSIGLIO DIRETTIVO.' Being printed on one side only of a sheet of thin white cardboard, it looks much like the general regulations for tenants such as one often finds affixed somewhere near the main entrances of apartment houses in countries like Germany, Switzerland or Austria. In Italy, apparently, the imposition of such rules has never been, nor is to this day, customary. But Trieste in its authoritarian Austrian days may have had them. 14 Thus, from the handmade covers to the tearsheets of Chapter II, it would seem that it was indeed James Joyce himself who carefully pasted up the installments of Chapters I and II of A Portrait , and that he did so in Trieste, shortly after July 15, 1914, when Chapter II ended in The Egoist . Thereafter, although Joyce did not leave Trieste until June, 1915, he would not have been able to attend to the subsequent chapters in the same manner. For, as we learn from his letter to Harriet Weaver of July 24, 1915 from Zurich ( Letters , II, 355), he received no copy of The Egoist in Trieste subsequent to the issue of July 15, 1914. The letter of July 24, 1915, itself an acknowledgement of the receipt of the copies to date of The Egoist for 1915, specifies that Joyce had "not yet seen the numbers for 1 and 15 August, 1 and 15 September and 15 December [1914]". 15 The Joyce correspondence, besides allowing some inferences as to how EC-W as a whole came about in its present make-up, makes it possible to trace with some accuracy the history of the first two chapters therein, and incidentally explains the care with which they were prepared. They were the first part, submitted by Joyce himself, of the copy for Grant Richards who, on the basis of the contract for Dubliners , had first refusal of Joyce's books until 15 June, 1919. 16 On July 3rd, 1914, Joyce wrote to Grant Richards: "I shall of course, as agreed between us, give you the opportunity of publishing [ A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ] next year in book. If you cannot find the papers I could send you my copies." ( Letters , II, 335 f.), and on April 30th, 1915, to Harriet Weaver: ". . . the first half of the book was forwarded to him by me last July." 17 In an undated letter, probably late in January, 1915, Joyce further informed Richards: "My friend Mr Ezra Pound will send you the fourth, fifth and third chapters of my novel so as to save time" ( Letters , II, 336). Richards had apparently undertaken "to give a definite answer within three weeks after the completed MS was in his possession", 18 and Joyce was anxious to press his decision, as in the meantime James B. Pinker had made an offer to act as Joyce's literary agent. Ezra Pound was to negotiate an agreement with him on Joyce's behalf, and Joyce wrote to Pound on March 17, 1915: "The rest of the Portrait of the Artist had better be sent on to Grant Richards as soon as it is ready. . . . If he decides not to publish . . . I am quite willing to entrust the disposal of the rights to Mr Pinker." 19 On March 24, Joyce wrote again to Richards ( Letters , II, 337) saying he presumed that the complete copy of the book was now in his possession, but the next day he wrote to Harriet Weaver: Mr Grant Richards, publisher, has the right of refusal of [my novel]. I believe the greater part of the novel is now in his hands. If the last instalments (May to August) have been set up I should be very much obliged if you could have a proof of them pulled. I am sure that Mr Pound will send them on to Mr Grant Richards. My reason for troubling you is that, in view of Mr Pinker's offer, I think it is to my advantage to know as soon as possible Mr Grant Richards' decision ( Letters , II, 338). Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co., the printers of The Egoist since the February issue (in which Chapter V commenced) had not yet, however, set up type beyond the issue for April 1st. To oblige Joyce, and in order to enable Richards to reach a decision on the book publication, Harriet Weaver therefore, late in March, 1915, risked parting temporarily with the pages of the Chapter V typescript which had not yet been set up. 20 This was technically possible because for the May issue, which was a special Imagist number, the serialisation of A Portrait was to be interrupted. There was consequently a time lapse between installments of two months. On April 22nd, Harriet Weaver informed Joyce accordingly, specifying when she needed the typescript returned. 21 Joyce replied on April 30th, ( Letters , I, 79 f.), and on May 7th he wrote to Pinker: "The fifth chapter of my novel must . . . be returned to The Egoist not later than the 20 May as it is needed for the June issue" ( Letters , II, 341). On May 18th Richards rejected the novel, 22 whereupon the disposal of the book rights went to Pinker. The copy which Richards had received piecemeal between July, 1914, and April, 1915, must also have gone to Pinker. Certainly the tearsheets Joyce had sent him from Trieste of Chapters I and II did, as is witnessed by the Pinker business card on the front leaf of Chapter I in EC-W. How much of the rest of EC-W originally belonged to the Richards-Pinker copy is less easy to decide. Chapter V stands apart in the set because it alone has the deletions of extraneous matter in blue crayon and contains no line-counts. Chapters I, II and IV are linked by the line-counts in pencil, not present, as the ones in ink are, in Chapter III. Chapters III and IV in turn are linked by the orange crayon used for cancellations and marginal annotations, and, in addition, by the original title inscription in faded black ink on the brown paper folder: 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Chapters III,IV', to which a dot in the centre of the line and the roman numeral 'V' seem to have been added later. (A yet later addition on the brown paper folder are the words in permanent black ink: 'from The Egoist. see Mr Joyce's corrections to chapters III+IV in green envelope'.) As the handwriting is apparently Harriet Weaver's, the brown paper folder still extant may well have been the one in which she originally, in February/ March 1915, gave Ezra Pound Chapters III and IV for Grant Richards' perusal, but whether both chapters in EC-W are still in the identical sheets Richards read them in is another question. The absence of line-counts in pencil in Chapter III suggests that only Chapters I, II and IV have survived in the present set from the earliest discernible point in time of its previous history. There is a possibility that the line-counts in pencil are traces of Grant Richards' deliberations over the novel. This would put the galley-proofs of Chapter IV among the material gathered together by Ezra Pound for him. It would also mean that an earlier set of tearsheets of Chapter III was replaced by the present set (which has no pencilled line-counts) some time after EC-W left Richards. On the other hand, Chapter III shares the line-counts in ink with Chapters I, II and IV, but not with Chapter V. Logically one would therefore assume that Chapter III in its present state became part of EC-W before Chapter V in its present state did. It was in July 1915 that Joyce's London friends and agents were most urgently pressed by the author to enter into negotiations about the book publication of the novel with nothing but a wholly unexpurgated text. On July 24th, Joyce read the end of Chapter IV in the January issue of The Egoist as forwarded to him in Zurich and discovered that whole sentences had been left out. He wrote immediately to Harriet Weaver to complain about the carelessness of the printers, adding: "My MSS are in Trieste but I remember the text and am sending the correct version of [the] passages [in question] to my agent. The instalments printed by Ballantyne, Hanson and Co (February to July) are of course carefully done. I hope the other printers did not set up the numbers which I have not seen. . . ." ( Letters , II, 355). But they had done so; and when, a week later, Joyce had received and read the remaining issues for 1914 (August 1 to December 15), he wrote even more urgently to Pound: I find that deletions have been made in my novel: in the issues of 1 August and 1 January. Who has the typescript? Can you send me the pages corresponding to these instalments? If Mr Pinker has it you need not send it. If he has the published version I must have these deleted passages typed at once and sent to him as part of the novel which he is submitting to Martin Secker and Co for publication. (July 31st; Letters , II, 358). Already, however, there was a reply to his letter of July 24th under way from Harriet Weaver, explaining the textual corruptions and reassuring him that the censored passages were not lost. Harriet Weaver wrote on July 28th: It was because of Messrs. Partridge+Coopers' stupid censoring of your novel that we left them—that is, they had objected once or twice to things in other parts of the paper, but their behaviour over your novel was the crowning offence. They struck out a passage on Aug. 1st of last year. I could not help it. The rest was set up correctly until they came to the latter part of chapter four where as you have seen some sentences were omitted. I then submitted the whole of chapter five to them. They declined to set it up as it stood + so we left them. I am sorry to say that Messrs. Ballantyne are now acting in the same way. . . . Mr Pinker has proofs containing all the deleted matter. I hope you will not have this annoyance when the novel comes to be printed in book form. . . . The deletions of January 1, 1915, were in print in the Chapter IV galleys, and the Chapter III deletion of August 1, 1914, is contained in the column of page-proof prefixed to the Chapter III tearsheets in EC-W. From the absence of pencilled line-counts in these tearsheets on the one hand and the mechanically uniform application therein of the line-counts in ink on the other, it seems probable, indeed, that Harriet Weaver, acting upon Joyce's letter of July 24th, supplied Pinker with a complete new set of Chapter III tearsheets plus the additional column of page-proof for the beginning of the chapter (rather than with this page-proof only) for the actual purpose of his submitting the novel to Secker. At the time, however, she may hastily have entered therein pencil markings only, now partly erased or over-ruled in orange crayon. The orange crayon markings in their turn, which provide a firm link between the extant sheets of Chapters III and IV, would seem to be later than the pencilled deletions of extraneous matter in Chapter III. They were doubtless made by Miss Weaver also, but at a time when both chapters as they survive were in her hands at once. As the main function of the orange crayon is to mark and draw attention to the censored passages, she may not have applied it to this end until EC-W eventually passed into her hands and was sent by her to various printers and at least one publisher. After the return of the Chapter V typescript needed as copy for the forthcoming June 1—September 1 installments, the Richards-Pinker copy, then in the hands of Pinker, was incomplete. But the Egoist printers appear to have had the entire chapter in type by the end of July. Pinker was able to reassure Harriet Weaver, who feared otherwise after the renewed interference of Ballantyne's in the August 1 issue, that he had submitted to Secker not the expurgated but the complete text in galleys of the last two fifth chapter installments. 23 The proof-markings in the galley-slip still extant among the Chapter V tearsheets suggest that Pinker got the galleys from the printers at the end of July when, with the corrections made, the pages for the August 1 issue of The Egoist had been imposed. There would have been galleys for him, too, specially pulled, for the portion of the text to be published in September. The February-June installments would have been in the complete issues of The Egoist for these months, as was the case with the copy submitted to Richards (see above, fn. 20), or else already in tearsheets, as in the present EC-W. The present Chapter V tearsheets, however, with their blue crayon cancellations of extraneous matter, were in all probability assembled in Pinker's office after the publication of the last installment on September 1st, as the blue crayon markings therein are uniform throughout. At the same time, the absence of line-counts in ink suggests that the tearsheets which now make up Chapter V in EC-W are not identical in any part with the state of the copy for Chapter V at the time when the inked line-counts were made. It seems possible that the inked line-counts were made by Martin Secker &amp; Co. in August, 1915. When they refused to publish and returned the novel to Pinker, the makeshift copy for Chapter V was replaced by the present uniform one, incorporating a galley slip for the censored passages only, which would thus be all that remains of the Chapter V copy as submitted to Secker. 23a But with Chapter V replaced, EC-W as it now survives was complete. It would thereafter have been the copy which Pinker circulated among the London publishers whom he hoped to interest in Joyce's novel. The set passed from Pinker to Harriet Weaver in April 1916, presumably, when Pinker finally consented to the proposed publication by The Egoist Ltd. and the agreement to that effect had been signed by author, agent and publisher. Harriet Weaver duly noted on the title-pages of Chapters I and II that they had been "prepared by Mr Joyce" and changed the return address from Pinker's to that of The Egoist Ltd. Now may have begun the copy's round not of publishers, but of printers, 24 and it was for this purpose, as suggested, that Harriet Weaver emphasized the censored passages for restitution in Chapters III and IV and marked the exact positions of insertion in all three chapters affected by cuts. This seems to have been done in two distinct stages: the markings in orange crayon in Chapters III and IV are earlier, and some at least of the marginal notes and positionings in black ink are later, as witnessed by the black ink superinscription over orange crayon at the end of Chapter IV. Lastly, the manuscript errata lists in their green envelope were included in the set after May 25th and before June 9th, 1916 (see Letters , II, 378-379), and note taken of their presence in permanent black ink on the brown paper folder for Chapters III-V. The pencilled notes on Chapters I and II, finally— 'No corrections here. H.S.W.' and 'Nor have I [a] copy of those of first two chapters. [H.S.W.]'—were obviously also made in two stages, and while the latter would seem the counterparts to the note about 'Mr. Joyce's corrections to chapters III+IV in green envelope', the former may refer to corrections in the sense of reinsertions of censored text and thus correspond to the markings of omissions in Chapters III-V. Again, the latter notes also suggest that EC-W was out of Harriet Weaver's hands when the marked-up tearsheets of Chapters I and II arrived with a letter from Joyce of June 9 (else she might have transferred the authorial corrections to her copy). By this time the publication of A Portrait in New York (and first by John Marshall) was under consideration, to be printed from other copy than EC-W. This set was once more at hand when William Heinemann had been persuaded to read Joyce's novel for himself and Ezra Pound on July 12th urged Harriet Weaver to send him the complete text. 25 She mentions in one of her two letters of September 7th to Joyce that she had sent Heinemann her copy containing "the deleted sentences" and that he had not yet given it back (although he had declined to publish by August 19th). When the set finally returned to her it could serve no further purpose, for the book publication of A Portrait was then firmly in the hands of B. W. Huebsch of New York. There is some reason, incidentally, to suspect that most of the observed markings of undesirable passages of text are William Heinemann's (presumably those in pencil, at least, if not those in indelible pencil), on the grounds that if they were the marks of an earlier reader they would not have been left standing in the margins to catch a later reader's attention. EC-W remained in Harriet Weaver's possession until she gave it to the British Museum in 1951. As a document relating to the publishing history of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , EC-W is thus of considerable interest. In terms of the textual history of the novel, its relevance, while specific, is yet narrowly circumscribed. Of greatest potential value and importance for the establishing of a critical text are its authorial errata lists. Their position must be assessed in relation to the documents central to the textual transmission, and in particular to EC-A, the printer's copy for H. This entails a reconsideration of the nature and date of EC-A. 26 Anderson describes EC-A as fully and, except for some additional markings clearly made in the printinghouse, uniformly corrected in Joyce's own hand, and identifies it with a set of tearsheets dispatched by Harriet Weaver on March 31st, 1916—and described by her in a letter of that date—to E. Byrne Hackett. Hackett in his turn sent it on to B. W. Huebsch in portions, beginning on May 4th, 1916 (Lidderdale, p. 122). By June 2nd Huebsch thereupon felt able to make a provisional offer, and on June 16th he proposed firmly to publish the book (Lidderdale, p. 123; Anderson, p. 189). But the copy in which he read the text cannot have been the one he eventually printed it from: EC-A cannot be identified as the Hackett copy. For it is a fact that Huebsch not only agreed to printing "absolutely according to the author's wishes, without deletion" ( Letters , I, 91), but also made great efforts to obtain copy with Joyce's own corrections. Had he been in the possession of EC-A from the outset, the lengthy exchange of letters about the author's corrections between him, Harriet Weaver and James Joyce himself, extending over more than four months from June 16 to October 24, 1916, would have been pointless. 27 In May 1916, it looked as if John Marshall of New York was going to publish A Portrait . For The Egoist Ltd. in London, Harriet Weaver was proposing an agreement on the same lines as the one which later came into effect with B. W. Huebsch, namely that sheets of the American printing be supplied for the English edition. James Joyce was interested in the details of correction and proofreading, and an exchange of letters between him and Harriet Weaver in late May and early June establishes what copy and what corrections were available, or were made available, for Marshall. To Joyce's enquiry of May 25th, I do not know where the proofs are to be read. . . . Would it help in any way if I read and checked the third, fourth and fifth chapters which I have in the instalments from 1 August 1914 to 1 September 1915? If the printers set from them this would weed out some of the errors but of course not the new ones which they will put in . . . But it would be almost as much trouble to find the places in the new proofs as the paging will be different ( Letters , II, 378), Harriet Weaver replied on May 31st: I have still the typescript of Chapter V and I am sending this off today to Mr. Marshall asking him to let his printers set up from this exactly as it stands, without adding commas or capitals. As I was stupid enough to destroy the rest of the typescript it would be a help if you would kindly do what you suggest and weed out errors in chapters III and IV. If you will then send them to me . . . I will insert the passages deleted by our printers and forward them to Mr. Marshall. . . . I will despatch to you today cuttings containing chapters IτII and perhaps you will correct them also and let me have them back. I shall ask Mr. Marshall either to send me proofs or have them corrected according to the corrected text. Before June 9th, when he returned the cuttings of Chapters I and II after taking less than 24 hours over correcting them, Joyce had already dispatched separately the corrections for Chapters III and IV ( Letters , II, 379). There can be no doubt that what Harriet Weaver received from him and acknowledged in a letter dated June 12 were the errata lists to Chapters III and IV as they survive in EC-W. As the letter of May 25th seems to suggest, Joyce had his copy of the Egoist text of the last three chapters already annotated when he wrote, or else did the annotation while awaiting Harriet Weaver's reply, and he certainly did not spend more than a day or two over tabulating the corrections when she asked for them. The authorial errata lists for Chapters III and IV (EC-W, fols. 3-6) can therefore be dated very narrowly to the first week of June, 1916. Moreover, yet another very definite fact emerges from the correspondence as quoted: at no time between the end of July, 1914, and June 8th, 1916, had James Joyce had in his possession a full set of tearsheets of A Portrait . The set which was sent to Hackett on March 31, 1916, and was passed on by him to Huebsch, if it contained any corrections at all apart from the insertions of the deleted passages as referred to in Harriet Weaver's covering letter (Anderson, p. 189), cannot have been corrected by Joyce. It cannot, therefore, have been EC-A. The copy which was thus assembled for John Marshall to print from was described to B. W. Huebsch six weeks later: "I have written to ask Mr Marshall to send on to you his copy of the text which contains Mr Joyce's corrections. . . . Mr Joyce would like the book printed exactly according to this corrected text (the fifth chapter being the original typescript)". 28 For a month Huebsch waited to hear from Marshall and to receive the corrected text from him and then, on August 25, wrote to him in Quebec, while at the same time informing Harriet Weaver that no contact had as yet been established. Probably still confident, however, that the Marshall copy would soon be in his hands, he added that—subject to Pinker's cabled agreement to certain modifications of the publishing contract—"I shall proceed at once with the setting up of the book" ( Letters , I, 93). But Huebsch never obtained the corrected text from Marshall. In letters of September 8 and September 20 to Harriet Weaver he again specifically mentions this fact, and thereafter the matter is dropped because Harriet Weaver was supplying him with alternative copy. 29 By September 8, still without copy to print from, Huebsch decided to accept an offer Miss Weaver had made on August 19th (the day she had learnt that William Heinemann was definitely not willing to publish A Portrait in England): "request that you send me the duplicate offered . . . as I presume it contains corrections not to be found in the copy I have." Harriet Weaver had in fact anticipated this request immediately on receiving Huebsch's letter of August 25th in London on September 6th. Without a moment's delay, she had marked up new tearsheets of Chapters III and IV from the authorial errata lists in her possession and posted them that same evening. Tearsheets of Chapters I, II and V she annotated as far as she was able to from memory—that is, she entered in them the kinds of corrections she remembered Joyce had made in the copy for Marshall—and she mailed them with a covering letter to Huebsch the next day; and she cabled to New York that the Joyce corrections were on their way. But, as she emphasized to Huebsch, she was at the same time sending another set of cuttings of Chapters I, II and V to Joyce, asking him to enter his authentic corrections and to post them straight to New York to avoid further delay. 30 Joyce duly corrected them but returned them to the Egoist office ( Letters , I, 95), whereupon Harriet Weaver forwarded them to New York on September 23rd: "I have this morning received from Mr Joyce his corrections of Chapters I, IIτV of his novel, which I send you herewith . . . there seem to be a good many more corrections than I sent you." The receipt of Chapters I-V as marked up and sent by Harriet Weaver on September 6th and 7th (with Chapters III and IV only containing authorized corrections from the authorial errata lists) was acknowledged by Huebsch on September 20th, though he refused to begin to print from them (he apparently even believed that he had not yet received the complete text of the novel): "I have received your . . . letters . . . enclosing revised copy of Chapters I, II, III, IV and V. . . . I am afraid that it will scarcely be worth while going ahead until we have the complete copy because in the long run we will lose time by making many corrections in the chapters following those above named. I shall not go ahead until I get the rest of the book whether it be from Mr. Joyce or from Mr. Marshall, though the latter seems unlikely." On October 6th, the authorially corrected tearsheets of Chapters I, II and V had arrived in New York, and on October 17th Huebsch was able to write: "You will be glad to know that the book is in the hands of the printer and I hope to be able to get it out during the present season." From the documentary evidence of the Weaver-Huebsch correspondence, then, it would seem that Huebsch's printer's copy in Chapters I, II and V consisted of Egoist tearsheets corrected by Joyce himself between September 7th and 23rd, and in Chapters III and IV of tearsheets marked up by Harriet Weaver from the authorial errata lists in her possession on September 6th, 1916. Yet Anderson (p. 188) asserts that EC-A, which was undoubtedly Huebsch's printer's copy, is uniformly corrected in Joyce's hand. For the purposes of this article I have not been able to inspect EC-A in the Slocum Collection to ascertain how exhaustive Anderson's description of it is. If Chapters III and IV in EC-A are without question corrected by Joyce himself, this fact would still need to be explained. But it is true that Anderson never considers the possibility of EC-A being a composite copy, while the preceding descriptions of EC-W and the lost Marshall copy argue that it would only follow precedence if it was, and only strengthen the belief that the conclusions drawn from the evidence of the Weaver-Huebsch correspondence are sound. Moreover, even if all non-printinghouse annotation in all chapters of EC-A as described is 'in black ink by a pen with a very fine point', the possibility is not ruled out that the corrections were in fact made by two different pens. For it may be observed in the galley-proof insertion in Chapter V of EC-W that proof-marking in London (by Harriet Weaver?) was also done with black ink in very fine strokes. In addition, there is at least one piece of internal evidence from variants in compound words which would further urge a reexamination of the agent or agents correcting EC-A. Joyce's intention was to alter a majority of the text's hyphenated words into one-word compounds. But, as Harriet Weaver explained to Huebsch in a letter of May 2nd, 1917, "in most places where he had crossed [the hyphens] out, he meant the words to be joined together but the printers have misunderstood and, in many places, separated them" ( Letters , II, 393 fn.). Consequently, Joyce's corrections to the Huebsch edition (and Harriet Weaver's additions thereto) contain 87 requests for joining together separated compounds. Their distribution, however, is 69 (all told) in Chapters I, II and V and only 18 in Chapters III and IV, of which only 9 are corrections to separations introduced in H. Harriet Weaver's instructions—if it was she who marked up Chapters III and IV in EC-A—appear to have been less subject to misinterpretation than Joyce's. What is beyond doubt, however, is that Huebsch's printer's copy was not the set of tearsheets dispatched from London on March 31st, reaching Huebsch via Hackett by June 2nd, 1916. Consequently, Joyce's manuscript errata lists to Chapters III and IV now surviving in EC-W, which were tabulated in the first week of June, are of an earlier date than is the marking of corrections for these chapters in EC-A. If Anderson's description were found valid and the corrections in Chapters III and IV of EC-A are in Joyce's own hand, their authority would confirm that of the errata lists or supersede it in cases of conflict. But if the marking of Chapters III and IV in EC-A was done simply by copying Joyce's manuscript corrections, these represent the only authoritative alterations to the Egoist text of Chapters III and IV in preparation of the first book edition. The First and Second Editions (H and B): Joyce's Corrections and the Printer's Copy for B With EC-W, Harriet Weaver in 1951 gave to the British Museum a list of corrections to the 1916 New York and London edition (H) of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . 31 It is headed: ' CORRECTIONS. A portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . B. W. Huebsch: New York: 1916. The Egoist Ltd: London: 1916.', and bears the typewritten signature on its last page: 'JAMES JOYCE, Seefeldstrasse 73 III Zurich VIII.' This is a carbon of a 16-page typewritten list with 364 typewritten entries for 365 separate corrections to be made. It is clear that it is yet another copy of Joyce's 'nearly 400' corrections to the first edition. 32 These are still extant in the original manuscript (Y). Joyce wrote them out in Zurich in April, 1917, and sent them to Pinker in London on April 10th, requesting: "Kindly have them typed (with copy) and forwarded by two successive posts to my publishers in New York" ( Letters , II, 393). The corrections are also extant in a typescript ribbon-copy (YT). From the description given of YT (Anderson, p. 197) it would seem that the Harriet Weaver copy of corrections in the British Museum is its carbon copy; I shall call it YTW. A note across the top of page 1 of the list, unsigned and undated, yet doubtless in Harriet Weaver's hand, states: Copy of corrections made by Mr. Joyce to 1st edition. Sent to Mr. Huebsh [sic] August 16, 1917 but were not made before printing of sheets for 3rd English edition (1921). Were made in 2nd English edition, printed in Southport, 1917. Were made also before printing of Jonathan Cape edition of 1924[.] But although YTW appears to be the carbon copy of YT as described by Anderson, it differs from YT in that 17 further corrections are interlined in it in their appropriate positions, in pencil, and in Miss Weaver's handwriting. Their number establishes a connection to the two handwritten pages with a total of 70 corrections in Miss Weaver's hand (YW), now accompanying YT, and bearing a note: 'Sent by Miss Weaver May 2/17.' In April 1917, then, James Joyce and Harriet Weaver independently drew up lists of corrections to H. 33 Anderson states that of the 70 corrections in YW, 17—all of them departures from EC-A in H—are omitted from Y/YT. Harriet Weaver appears to have conflated Joyce's list and her own, adding in YTW the 17 errors Joyce had missed. The total of entries in YTW is thus 381, the total of corrections 382. From Joyce's letter to Pinker of April 10th as quoted, from the fact that he informed Harriet Weaver on July 7th that Pinker had his corrections ( Letters , I, 107) and from Harriet Weaver's note on YTW 34 one might be led to infer that Pinker never forwarded the typescript and carbon he had been asked to prepare but kept them until Miss Weaver had been alerted to their existence and took it upon herself to send the ribbon copy to Huebsch very belatedly on August 16th, while using the carbon in preparation of her own second edition. But the Weaver-Huebsch correspondence reveals that the facts were different. The corrections seem indeed to have been typed at Pinker's office, and both the ribbon and the carbon copy must have been sent to Huebsch in the manner ordered by Joyce. Huebsch then returned the carbon copy to London at Harriet Weaver's request. When she wrote her explanatory note on YTW she misremembered the exact details: what she mailed to Huebsch on August 16th, 1917, was not the whole set of corrections, but only a handwritten list with 16 entries which contained 15 of the 17 additional corrections of YTW, plus one correction of a typist's error. 35 This one correction is the clinching piece of evidence: it would not make sense if YTW were not the carbon copy of YT, and its entry in Harriet Weaver's short supplementary list, as indeed this whole list itself, is meaningful only if never typescript and carbon together, but merely the carbon copy alone, was in her hands. The list, on one side of a single quarto-sized sheet of writing-paper, is still extant among the unpublished Weaver-Huebsch correspondence. From the letters, the facts can be filled in in greater detail. 36 In the latter half of April, 1917, Harriet Weaver was beginning to consider bringing out a second edition of A Portrait . Ideally, she wanted another joint operation with New York, but as import restrictions forbade the further purchase of printed sheets, she requested to be allowed to buy moulds of the New York edition instead. 37 She was aware that the text of the first edition needed correction but did not want to ask Joyce to correct it as he was at the time suffering acutely from his disease of the eyes. Instead, she compiled her own list of corrections (YW) and sent it to Huebsch on May 2nd. It arrived in New York on May 15th, the day after Huebsch, in reply to her request of April 18th, had written to Harriet Weaver: I have just received from Mr. Pinker a long list of corrections to be made in the plates, but unfortunately I have just printed a second edition from the first plates and unless there is a very large demand for the book, this edition is likely to last for a considerable time. I presume that you have received a duplicate list of the corrections. Under the circumstances, probably you would not want me to send you moulds. But neither from Pinker nor from Joyce had Harriet Weaver received a copy of the corrections. So, with no hope now of getting the corrected text from New York in either sheets or moulds, she decided to publish independently in England, with a reset text. On June 6th, she asked Huebsch to send her the corrections and suggested he have a copy made for her so as not to endanger the original in wartime Atlantic transit. Huebsch was pleased to oblige: I take pleasure in enclosing a copy of the corrections. . . . I am keeping a copy of the corrections here for my own use. It will be available for you if disaster overtakes the copy that I am forwarding. 38 It was not until July 28th (or thereabouts) that the carbon copy from Huebsch arrived in London. But meanwhile, Joyce had notified Harriet Weaver on July 7th that Pinker had his corrections. She replied on July 18th: "I got your corrections from your agent and the printers now have the book in hand." 38a The printers she refers to were the Pike's Fine Art Press of Brighton who on August 16th refused to print without deletion. Thus, the corrections as Harriet Weaver got them from Pinker before YTW arrived in London at the end of July did not enter the transmission of the text. YTW was used to annotate the printer's copy for the second edition of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , printed in Southport, England, in 1917—by Robert Johnson &amp; Co., the same printers who had been employed on The Egoist by Dorothy Marsden before Harriet Weaver became the editor (Lidderdale, p. 143)—and published by The Egoist Ltd. in London in 1918. This printer's copy has survived, and it was given by Harriet Weaver to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, between March 10th and 19th, 1952. Yet it was not until 1967 that even the Bodleian Library, alerted by Miss Weaver's biographers, became aware of the special nature of the volume which Harriet Weaver had most unobtrusively entrusted them with. She is said to have brought it along one day 'in her open-top bag' (Lidderdale, p. 426). Its relevance to the publishing history and the textual transmission of A Portrait has not yet been recognised or recorded. The volume is bound in the original dark green cloth of the London first edition, but as the body of the book is broken completely loose in the spine, the original binding is now merely folded around it. The book has been given a dark green slipcase for protection. A note in ink by Harriet Weaver is tipped in to the front flyleaf: The pencilled corrections in this copy of the first English edition of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man were made by me from a list of corrections sent by Mr. Joyce for the second edition, printed in Southport and published by The Egoist in 1917. They do not appear in the third edition (1921) for which sheets were again imported from the U.S.A. but they do appear in Mr. Jonathan Cape's edition (reset) of 1924. Harriet Weaver 4 Rawlinson Road Oxford March 10th, 1952 On collation, the majority of the pencilled annotations in the Bodley copy (HB) is found to be a very faithful transcript of YTW. 39 Of the changes called for in its 381 entries, Harriet Weaver fails to delete one comma, deletes another without warrant and fails to change a third into a colon. The identification of the volume as the printer's copy for B, immediately rendered likely by the pencilled alterations and additions in Harriet Weaver's hand to the copyright and printing notices on the verso of the title-page, rests mainly on a set of sparse but unmistakable printinghouse markings. For long stretches of the book, there are little pencilled crosses at the bottom of verso pages, or the top of recto pages, at regular intervals of four pages. Sometimes these divide off a syllable or a word or two at the end of a page or the beginning of the next, and the first word or syllable of a recto page is occasionally pencilled in at the bottom of the preceding verso page. B is of course virtually a page-for-page reprint of H, despite its smaller typeface. But inevitably the text on any given page in B does not always coincide to the word or syllable with that of its counterpart in H. Yet in every case where the text is out by a syllable or a word or two on pages marked in HB as described, the new page beginnings correspond exactly to the marked divisions. Typical compositorial notes like 'Line short' or "Two short', sometimes initialled by the person who wrote them, finally clinch the matter: the Bodley volume is the printer's copy for B, with the majority of its compositorial stints clearly marked. A further analysis, not yet undertaken, would probably make it possible to distinguish from the markings, from the typographical lay-out of the pages, and presumably from the treatment of punctuation and the like in the text itself, between two or more compositors. 40 The observance of Harriet Weaver's annotations by the printers of B was very faithful. In less than half a dozen instances were her directions misunderstood and the corrections not made according to intention. Only one marked correction was not carried out: p. 87.9 in B still reads 'reverie' (for: 'revery') in perpetuation of a typescript spelling which had passed via Egoist to H. 41 Thus all YTW corrections, but for these exceptions, duly entered the text of B. In addition, another six misprints and hyphenation errors which had eluded both Joyce and Harriet Weaver before were marked by her and corrected by the printers. Beyond that, Miss Weaver took it upon her own authority to remove wholesale, from about the middle of Chapter III onwards, all intermediary and final dashes in direct speech, and to introduce alternative punctuation consequent upon their removal where necessary. This altered the entire system of Joyce's designation and punctuation of dialogue in so far as it had survived in print. In the manuscript, there are dashes in place of the 'perverted commas' which Joyce so abhorred not only at the beginning of every direct speech but also before and after interruptions (where in print one is accustomed to commas and inverted commas: i.e. —said Stephen— rather than. . . .," said Stephen, ". . .), and at the end, where the dash in fact frequently stands without a further mark of punctuation. In the first printed text of A Portrait in The Egoist , this system of punctuation, so conspicuously idiosyncratic, has disappeared from the first two chapters and the first one and a half installments of the third and been replaced by initial dashes followed by regularized punctuation (though of course not inverted commas) in the middle and at the end of direct speeches. In these positions, Joyce's dashes—though not his dashes as combining the functions of all punctuation: especially at the ends of speeches periods have mostly been placed before dashes in print—break through only towards the end of the second installment of Chapter III of August 15, 1914, which was the fourth installment printed by Partridge &amp; Cooper. These printers had set inverted commas in A Portrait (as elsewhere) when they began to print The Egoist on July 1, 1914. In their second installment of July 15, which was the end of Chapter II, and their third, the beginning of Chapter III, they adopted the styling observable uniformly before in the initial ten installments printed by Johnson &amp; Co. of Southport. They carried it over even into three full pages of their fourth installment, the manuscript text of which contains the final dash in three individual instances. With two printinghouses conforming to the same pattern of variation in such accidentals, one might be inclined to suspect that the eventual change reflects a change in their copy, i.e. that the typescript made from Joyce's manuscript reproduces the manuscript punctuation of dialogue only from the middle of Chapter III onwards. The fragments of typescript of Chapters I and II which survive—and which will be described in greater detail below—show that this was not so. They contain all dashes, plus (on the typist's own authority) additional punctuation at the ends of speeches, and sometimes most illogically even before speech interruptions, in Chapter I, and an exact reproduction of Joyce's own styling in Chapter II, on which a different typist worked. That it was the first and not the second typist's styling which was eventually adopted by both the Partridge &amp; Cooper and the Ballantyne compositors might indicate that the identical typist typed all chapters except Chapter II (a possibility which, on broader evidence, will be discussed later). The move towards a more complete observance in The Egoist of the authorial punctuation of dialogue was as such quite possibly the result of editorial direction. The full system of dashes (though augmented by regularized final punctuation) manifests itself in print after Harriet Weaver's taking over as editor, albeit with a delay of three and a half installments. But the delay is explicable: the first editorial concern was to get rid of the inverted commas. Reference to the typography of the Joyce text in the earlier Egoist issues would have been appropriate and sufficient to guide Partridge &amp; Cooper's compositors in the treatment of their second installment. Thereafter, dialogue is virtually absent from long stretches of the text in Chapter III. Harriet Weaver would only have become alerted to the styling of the typescript as more frequent dialogue resumed in the chapter's second half, whereupon she may have given directions that it be fully adopted in print. This of course is but speculative reasoning. Yet the resulting fact is that the punctuation of direct speech is inconsistent not only in the Egoist serialisation but also in the first book edition. It is the lack of uniformity in the typographical appearance of the book which Harriet Weaver remedies in her preparation of the printer's copy for B in 1917. She now standardises the punctuation of dialogue according to the styling of the initial chapters. The over-all appearance of the text in print is thereby improved in the 1918 edition, however unauthorized this second editorial intrusion. One hardly feels called upon, therefore, to argue with Harriet Weaver's restyling. It must at present be left open whether even a critical edition should revert to the punctuation of the manuscript, unless, following the manner of the typist of Chapter II, it were to reproduce all dashes strictly without any additional punctuation in the middle and at the end of speeches. Yet such procedure would run the very real risk of ultimately obscuring rather than clarifying the text. Moreover, it should be observed that the dashes appear very much as a calligraphic feature of the manuscript which, as visually expressing the individuality of the author in his handwriting, it would take careful collaboration of editor and printer to recapture satisfactorily on the printed page. To fulfill the author's objective of avoiding inverted commas, it would seem sufficient to maintain Harriet Weaver's styling by preserving merely the initial dash in a direct speech. Nevertheless, it is true that the interference of typist(s), editor(s) and compositors has often altered and obscured the original sentence divisions of the dialogue in the novel. These await full restoration in a critical text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. New data about the textual transmission of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man have thus emerged from the discussion of three documents from its publishing history. Their influence on editorial decision and procedure has been incidentally considered. It now remains to outline a comprehensive editorial hypothesis on the basis of which a critical edition could be envisaged. The Text from Manuscript to Print In its authoritative textual witnesses, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man presents an almost classic case of linear and uncontaminated textual transmission. The faircopy holograph manuscript (D) is the only primary authoritative text of the novel. From it, five texts of secondary authority descend in linear succession: the typescript (T), the first printed version in the Egoist serialisation (E), and the first (H), the second (B) and the third (J) book editions. None of these secondary stages of transmission of the text relates back to any earlier stage than the one immediately preceding it, nor is the text of D ever conflated or 'contamined' with any of the secondary stages of authoritative transmission. 42 In establishing a critical text it should therefore be possible in principle to apply W. W. Greg's editorial rule which postulates that a critical text reproduce the earliest accessible authoritative text in spellings, punctuation and all other accidentals as well as in the body of its substantive readings, and that variants from the texts of secondary authority be admitted only when they are the result of correction and revision by the author and thus positively supersede the authority of the original readings. 43 The basic text of A Portrait is the author's manuscript. Authorial correction and revision intervened at each stage of transmission between D and J, thus conferring secondary authority on each of the textual witnesses T, H, B and J. It is the extent to which their variants are authoritative which must in each case be determined. For the text in H and B, the documents which contain the intervening authorial corrections and revisions survive. These are the errata lists to Chapters III and IV in EC-W, and EC-A, the printer's copy with Joyce's corrections to Chapters I, II and V, for H; and the 'nearly 400' authorial corrections (Y), plus the printer's copy, HB, for B. Thus the authority, or lack of authority, of the variants in the first and second book editions is demonstrable. The proofsheets of the two, or probably three rounds of correction which Joyce read for J have however not been preserved. 44 The authority of variant readings in J, therefore, can upon close and discriminating analysis of the total B-J variance be established by inference only. Lastly, and most seriously, the typescript made from D and used as printer's copy for E, that is to say one of the authoritative textual witnesses themselves, is almost entirely lost. There is consequently next to no documentary evidence available of possible authorial alterations before the text was typed, nor of typists' omissions or commissions, nor of authorial correction and revision of the typescript; nor can, other than by inference, printinghouse changes in E be separated from the total body of D-E variance. Here lies the rub; for in view of the large and weighty discrepancy in the text between D and E, it is only by successful differentiation of all these separate stages of authoritative and non-authoritative interference which, hypothetically, the text passed through from D to E that a true critical text can emerge. The external facts with which to fill this hiatus in the textual transmission are these. 45 The faircopy manuscript—bearing the date 'M.S. 1913' on its holograph title-page—was (it is assumed) written out by Joyce between December, 1913, and late October/early November, 1914. 46 Chapters I-III were merely copied over from papers (now lost) which had contained them in a virtually final textual stage for several years. But Chapters IV and V were in their final form only conceived during these months and written (though doubtless preliminary material existed for them, too) before they were copied to complete the faircopy manuscript. The typescript followed the manuscript in close pursuit, chapter by chapter. As from February 2nd, 1914, onwards the Egoist serialisation, too, was progressing in fortnightly installments, the inference is that each chapter of the typescript was prepared with considerable haste and received only superficial authorial attention before being dispatched to London. No proof of the Egoist text was read by Joyce. The internal evidence of the D-E variants should confirm or modify the assumed external facts. In the transmission of the text from D to E, the issues most critically at stake are the nature of the typescript, the evidence (if any) of authorial correction and revision before the typescript left Trieste, and the nature and degree of printinghouse interference with the text as it appears in print. Collation reveals most immediately the variation in accidentals. Close to 600 commas have been added in E and superimposed upon a system of commas, colons, semicolons and periods (with only the occasional exclamation or question mark) which, except in its commas, has been left largely intact. As the workmen of three printinghouses in succession set the text for A Portrait , it can be asserted that, on the whole, the additional commas were put in by them. The three printers did very nearly equal thirds of the novel: of the total of 123.5 printed Egoist columns, Johnson &amp; Co. set 41.5, Partridge &amp; Cooper 41.5, and Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co. 40.5 columns (approximately). But the distribution of added commas is such that Johnson &amp; Co. in ten installments added no more than 60, or about three commas in each two columns of print, while Partridge &amp; Cooper in 8 installments added 277 (7 per column), and Ballantyne &amp; Hanson in 7 installments 229 commas (less than 6 per column). 47 There is, moreover, a considerable fluctuation in numbers from one installment to the next—Partridge &amp; Cooper added 66 commas on July 1, 1914, their first installment, and only 8 a fortnight later—and even from page to page and column to column. This quite clearly reflects the punctuation habits of different workmen. Moreover, the scarcity of added commas in the Johnson &amp; Co. section of the text—itself undoubtedly the work of more than one compositor—reinforces the conclusion that the later inundation of the Egoist text with commas was a printinghouse restyling of the text. It strongly suggests that the typescript did not essentially alter the manuscript punctuation. The Egoist departure from the manuscript in other accidentals, such as capitalization, and hyphenation or two-word division of compounds, is far more restrained. 48 There is throughout the sections of the three printers a fairly even sprinkling of added hyphenations or compound divisions, and of added capitals. A distinction of typescript and printinghouse characteristics does not clearly manifest itself. On the contrary, it seems likely that a good number of compounds were hyphenated in E because they happened to be divided from one line to the next in T, as a good number of others are evidently hyphenated in print because they were demonstrably so divided in D and thus, by inference, entered the text of T with hyphens. Other hyphenations, such as 'good-bye', or the inevitable printed forms 'to-day', 'to-morrow', etc., were undoubtedly made according to stylesheet by the printinghouse compositors, and sometimes possibly by a typist before them. Typist's and compositors' habits likewise would seem to be the cause of added capitalization, such as the almost invariable spellings Protestant, Jesuit, Jews, Church, Mass, etc. for Joyce's protestant, jesuit, jews, church, mass. But it is very important to note that the added hyphenations and capitalizations, while of course unauthoritative in the Egoist text, are yet not inconsistent with the over-all manuscript styling. A large majority of the hyphenated and capitalized nouns and adjectives which occur in the Egoist text preserve faithfully the manuscript readings. Hyphenations and two-word divisions of compounds as well as capitalizations were largely eliminated by Joyce himself when he corrected the text for H and B. But his new directions then amount to no less than a systematic restyling of the text in print with respect to these accidentals. If the sometimes excessively liberal addition of commas in the Egoist text is regarded as a special case—and good reason for doing so lies in the fact that Joyce's original punctuation is both unorthodox and extremely light—the general treatment of accidentals in the printed text suggests, even more so than before, 49 that the workmen engaged on E were careful and competent. This creates a certain "climate of opinion" for the consideration of the substantive variants. There is, for example, an astonishing number of omissions of single words, phrases and even whole sentences from the text in E. 50 Anderson infers, and I believe quite rightly, that in the majority of cases these are typist's errors. In particular, he persuasively demonstrates (pp. 171 ff.) how the style of Joyce's prose by its repetitive rhetoric lends itself to the omission of phrases and sentences. His explanation of such errors by means of literary analysis can often be strengthened by taking note of the bibliographical evidence: where words and phrases are repeated in the text, their inscription on the manuscript page is frequently such that a typist's eyeskip in copying appears as the most likely mechanical reason for the omission of phrases and sentences. By contrast, the omission of single words which occurs with fair regularity throughout the text is not strictly the same phenomenon, and not as clearly explicable by literary or bibliographical criteria. It should, however, by way of hypothesis, and as a calculated methodical expedient, be acceptable to group all omissions together and provisionally to designate all omission in the extant text of E as an area of typescript error. If an omission is thus taken to be an error by principle of method, the question becomes negligible whether in actual fact it was a typist's or a compositor's blunder. The important consequence within the editorial hypothesis is that all variants in question are regarded as not authorized and that the original manuscript readings would demand to be restored in their place. If, on the other hand, the general rule in individual instances appears inapplicable, very good reasons must be found for a textual omission in E to be accepted as an authorial cut and thus to be editorially respected. Implied by such reasoning is the truth of the assumption that the typescript was only superficially read by the author before being dispatched to London. To infer thereupon from the variants themselves, i.e., from the accumulation of omissions in the extant text of E, that Joyce indeed missed a hundred or more such errors in the typescript would be an argument self-defeating in its circularity unless support for it be found outside the circle. This problem in its turn is secondary to the basic question—which yet remains to be tested—as to whether the author gave any attention at all to the text of the novel after completing the faircopy manuscript (and before correcting E for H). The editorial difficulties presented by the missing typescript would of course be considerably diminished if it could be positively demonstrated that he did not. Answers to the open questions must be sought by scrutinizing those groups of D-E variance which have not previously been analysed, and by relating the omissions to them. The substantive variants in E—317 in all by my count—are omissions, additions, and substituted readings. The additions are invariably confined to single words. They are few in number and make up a large part of what must be considered corrections of the manuscript text, of which there are 29 in all throughout the novel. These corrections, even if they involve an additional word, are mostly obvious enough, as when "shuffling along . . . in old pair of blue canvas shoes" becomes ". . . in an old pair . . ." (61.19), 51 and they can often easily be accounted for as the unaided work of the typist. That the typist was held to correct without specific directions by the author—or that a compositor far from Trieste did so by force of circumstance, should an incomplete or erroneous reading, real or fancied, have survived into his copy—is rendered likely when a miscorrection occurs, or a pedantic observance of grammatical congruence in tense or number sounds conspicuous. Except when miscorrection or style-sheet rectification of grammar are obvious, an edited text will of course accept the complete rather than the incomplete readings, regardless of whether or not the authority of each single addition can be ascertained. In Chapter V at least, if not before, such editorial policy can be justified by observing three individual one-word additions, two of them corrections of incomplete manuscript readings and one a genuine textual revision, which cannot reasonably be explained as anything but authorial in origin. No typist or compositor would have known how to complete the sentences: "What was their languid but the softness of chambering?" (:languid grace; 233.9), or ". . . a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last by what I call the rhythm of beauty." (:dissolved by; 206.23. 'ended' would perhaps have been an unguided guess), nor can anyone but the author be thought to have changed Cranly's toothpick at 229.33 into a 'rude toothpick', thus weaving once more into the fabric of the text the main characterizing adjective for Cranly. On the strength of these variants alone, authorial attention to the text between D and E must be admitted and taken into account as a real possibility. Automatically, it becomes a major concern of the editorial hypothesis to define its nature and extent. Thus, the readings substituted in E for good manuscript readings become the focus of attention: they become suspect of being authorized changes. The total number of altered readings is large, but many of them are immediately recognizable as errors (as for example the numerous substitutions of singular forms for the plural, and vice versa ), or at the very least as being 'indifferent' and thus not even cumulatively strong enough to prove their origin as authorial: definite articles alternate with indefinite articles, or articles with possessive pronouns; 'those' stands for 'these', alternative prepositions are introduced, or the relative pronouns 'which' and 'who' replace relative 'that' as it is frequently used by Joyce. Yet other variants, again clearly errors, are accountable for as simple misreadings of Joyce's handwriting: 'jacket' becomes 'pocket', 'cracked' becomes 'crooked', 'harsh' becomes 'hoarse', 'like' becomes 'little', 'Kenny' becomes 'Kenory', 'slap' becomes 'step', 'burned' becomes 'turned', 'diseased' becomes 'disclosed', 'hear' becomes 'bear', 'head' becomes 'lead', 'true' becomes 'fine', the nonce-word 'nicens' becomes the none-word 'niceus', and the sentence "A rim of the young moon cleft the pale waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey sand" is made to read, "A rim of the young moon cleft the pale waste of sky line, the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey sand." Once all such variants are discounted, only very few readings remain which deserve closer attention. There should be no doubt, for example, that in the list of Stephen's classmates in Chapter II: Roderick Greets John Lawton Anthony MacSwiney Simon Mangan (70.25) the names Greets and Mangan were altered to Kickham and Moonan by the author before they thus entered the printed text in E. There is precedence for the authorial change Mangan&gt;Moonan in the manuscript (Anderson, p. 170). This renders authorial attention here all the more probable, though it just could mean that an observant typist on his own accord had altered the present reading to bring it into conformity with the others. That this was not the case is suggested by the number of instances in which the name Mangan still stands unaltered in E. Moreover, it would not do to seek different explanations for two changes at the same point in the text: and the alteration of Greets to Kickham can be authorial only. Similarly, the retitling of 'Father' Barrett as 'Mr' Barrett at 30.1 in the Christmas dinner scene in Chapter I would seem to be a Joycean correction. Authorial correction and revision further manifests itself where identical changes are spaced out in the text. For example, the 'avenue of limes' which leads up to Clongowes—and it was apparently an avenue of limes—is an 'avenue of chestnuts' throughout the manuscript. In print, the change has been consistently made once each in Chapters I, II and III. These few variants taken together confirm that Chapters I to III received authorial attention at the typescript stage of transmission. Apart from 'chestnuts'&gt;'limes' (24.10) and 'Father' &gt; 'Mr' (30.1), however, there is in Chapter I only one more variant—'in the square' &gt; 'there' (43.24)—for which under the guidelines of the hypothesis here developed authority can be claimed with some confidence. The remainder of the substituted readings in this chapter are either obviously erroneous, or misreadings of Joyce's handwriting, or else too indifferent in character to be made out as authorial in origin. The situation in Chapter II is similar. To Greets &gt; Kickham, Mangan &gt; Moonan, and 'chestnuts' &gt; 'limes' (93.11), it would again seem safe to add only one or perhaps two more variants: 'turning back in irresoluteness' &gt; 'turning in irresolution' (83.31); and 'watching her as he undid her gown' &gt; 'watching her as she undid her gown' (100.35). 52 There is admittedly a group of three further variants which, occurring within a few pages of each other, might suggest an intermittently closer authorial attention to the typescript: 'arching their arms above their heads' &gt; 'circling their arms above their heads' (74.6), 'the old restless moodiness had again filled his heart' &gt; '. . . had again filled his breast' (77.20), and 'the patchwork of the footpath' &gt; 'the patchwork of the pathway' (79.1). However, careful scrutiny of the original readings as they look in Joyce's handwriting makes it virtually certain that "circling' and 'breast' are really misreadings of 'arching' and 'heart'. The apparent cluster is thus reduced to a single variant. By noting further that 'footpath' in several other instances throughout the novel is Joyce's unvaried term for "pavement", one is led to reject 'pathway' as a typist's or compositor's unauthorized substitution. Thus, where variants in E are substituted for good manuscript readings, Chapter I appears to contain but three, and Chapter II a maximum of five authorial corrections. Of this total of eight, six (or five) show concern with factual accuracy ('Mr' Barrett, and 'limes' [twice]) or internal consistency of the text (Kickham, Moonan, 'limes' again, and 'he' &gt; 'she', if this was an authorial correction). The two others seem concerned with a greater appropriateness ('there' as substituted for 'in the square') or fluency ('turning in irresolution') of expression. Under the criteria by which these eight variants were separated from a host of erroneous or indifferent readings, no variants at all—except the third instance of 'chestnuts' &gt; 'limes' (108.34) early in Chapter III—can be made out with assurance in Chapters III and IV. It is only in Chapter V that the correcting and revising hand of the author is again unmistakably present. The corrections here appear to have been made as reticently, or superficially, as in the first two chapters, but, where they occur, to have been made for similar reasons. Owing to the length of the chapter, their total number is slightly higher than before. Yet six of them, that is two-thirds of a total of nine, are clustered within twelve pages of the printed text. 'His toothpick' &gt; 'his rude toothpick' (229.33), which represents both a stylistic improvement and a concern for greater precision, has already been referred to. Precision and factual accuracy is also the aim of 'Drumcondra' &gt; 'Lower Drumcondra' (188.32), 'unesthetic emotions' &gt; 'not aesthetic emotions' (206.10) and 'northward' &gt; 'southward' (238.23), while improvement of style and expression predominantly motivate the changes 'benevolent mirth' &gt; 'benevolent malice' (210.27), 'ringless' &gt; 'toneless' (227.23), 53 'old swans' &gt; 'a game of swans' (228.20), and 'brief hiss' &gt; 'soft hiss' (232.31). To this latter variant, the ninth and last in the list: 'brief hiss' &gt; 'swift hiss' (226.27) is related, which however would seem to require emendation. At 232.27: ". . . and a soft hiss fell again from a window above", 'soft' is the original manuscript reading, while at lines 226.27 and 232.31 the manuscript still has 'brief hiss'. In revision, 232.31 follows 232.27 to read 'soft hiss'. But surely it is the sentence at 226.27, which in the manuscript reads "A sudden brief hiss fell from the windows above him . . ." that both occurrences on p. 232 are meant to recall. The revision was presumably retroactive, the author going back to alter 'brief hiss' on p. 226 after having unified the readings on p. 232 to 'soft hiss'. I take it that 'swift hiss' at 226.27 is an error of the E compositor, who misread 'soft' as it was written in by hand in the typescript, and would therefore emend to 'soft hiss' on the strength of the parallel revision at 232.31. Thus, in the field of substitute readings, where initially all variants were suspect of being authorial in origin, the number of authoritative changes in the Egoist text has been narrowed down to a total of 18. All other variant readings substituted in E for good manuscript readings, that is something like half of the 317 D-E substantive variants, must consequently be classed as unauthoritative. This large group of variants, then, seems in view of a projected editorial hypothesis to be practically identical in nature with that of the omissions, and by our comprehensive analysis it is thereby suggested that all substantive variants in E, with the exception of a small number of narrowly definable and identifiable readings, are unauthorized. This is a result attractive in its consistency and, though essentially hypothetical, it gains all possible probability from the three-pronged approach to the evidence as divided into three distinct groups of variants. It should be recalled at this stage, however, that the entire large group of the omissions was approached above with the initial expectation of a total lack of authorial interference and has so far been only provisionally designated as an area of exclusively unauthorized variation. Before final conclusions are asserted the omissions should therefore be briefly surveyed once more with regard to the fact that a certain degree of authorial attention to the text has meanwhile been ascertained. The authorial correction of the text was, it is true, evidently reticent and probably superficial, and to have established it as a fact cannot therefore in principle change our conception of the group of the omissions taken as a whole. The characteristics are far too strong which indicate that they were largely typist's errors which went by unnoticed in the author's reading of the typescript. In the three chapters in particular which contain more than one authorial variant each, there is not a single omission which by its nature suggests that it, too, might be authorial in origin. It is only in the latter half of Chapter III that doubts arise whether all omissions observed should be blamed on the typist (or compositor). At the rhetorical climax of the last of the hell sermons there is a passage which in the printed text has three separate omissions in brief succession: O what a dreadful punishment! An eternity of endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual torment, without one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of agony [limitless in extent,] limitless in intensity, of torment [infinitely lasting,] infinitely varied, of torture that sustains eternally that which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant of which is itself [an eternity, and that eternity] an eternity of woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just God. (133.10-20). According to the rules established by Anderson for the treatment of omitted phrases, 54 which have in principle been accepted above, there is no alternative to regarding these omissions as three errors of the typist. But thus to regard them means to accept that he nodded three times separately in rapid succession, and yet in a curiously systematic way. On literary grounds, on the other hand—and therefore by reasoning which lies outside the area of textual analysis based on the transmitting documents—it is tempting to see the author at work here, pruning an excess of repetitive rhetoric for the sake of stylistic improvement, and a heightened rather than a lessened impact of the words. Under this aspect, the three separate errors of the typist would appear transformed into a single tripartite authorial cut. Were this to prove the only example in the text where omission became suspect of being authorial in origin, an editorial decision to respect it as such would be very hard indeed to defend, however much one's instinctive literary feeling were averse to restoring the full manuscript wording. But very tentatively something like a case can be made out for a repeated incidence of authorial cuts in the second half of Chapter III, whereby these would become identifiable and separable as a group from the other omissions, and thus editorially acceptable as readings in the variant form of the printed text. Three such omissions occur a few pages after the passage quoted which could also conceivably be due to a desire to reduce a repetitiveness of expression (as indicated): Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower [soul than his] soul? His soul sickened at the thought. . . . (140.1-2). Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how could he have done such things without shame? A [madman, a loathsome] madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God! (140.14-20). He could still escape from the shame. [O what shame! His face was burning with shame.] Had it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. (142.24-30). As it happens, it is in close vicinity to these passages that a later intentional deletion is recorded. The first of the errata on EC-W, fol. 2, is "delete 'of herrings'" and refers to "Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets [of herrings]" (140.26). This may be pure coincidence, and it proves no more than that Joyce was in fact capable of making a cut in A Portrait —an attitude of authorial self-criticism not readily evident otherwise in this text. This deletion has no intrinsic similarity to the four examples of omission in E here considered, and it can hardly be taken to reinforce an assumption that they be of authorial origin. If of course it were true that they all are genuine cuts, then this would indicate that the latter half of Chapter III, portraying as it does Stephen's intensely painful self-torture, gave particular pains in the writing and was textually fluid for longer than any other section of the novel. However, in the absence of the Chapter III typescript any argument of textual or of literary criticism in relation to the variant passages must remain highly speculative. On the whole, then, the variant readings in E caused by the omission of words, phrases and sentences from the manuscript text can now confidently be declared unauthoritative, as can the large majority of those variants in E which are substitutes for good manuscript readings. Conversely: on the basis of the preceding analysis, we consider, out of a total of 317 substantive variants between D and E, only 18 substitute readings, most of 29 corrections of incomplete or obviously erroneous manuscript readings, and possibly six omissions (occurring in four passages in the second half of Chapter III) as authorized. With respect to the body of D-E variance, provisional rules for establishing a critical text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man may be set out as follows: Of the variants in E, 1. Admit all corrections of incomplete and erroneous D readings that are not obviously either miscorrections or stylesheet rectifications of grammar and syntax; 2. admit 18 authorial corrections and revisions; 3. do not admit other substitutes for good D readings, whether or not they seem individually possible as variants; 4. do not admit readings in E which are the result of omission of single words, phrases, or sentences of the D text (with the possible exception of 6 such variants in the second half of Chapter III); 5. do not admit the E variation in accidentals. 55 The Typescript The hypothesis developed in the preceding pages for the total of the substantive D-E variance, an hypothesis which in turn must serve as the basis for a comprehensive theory of the textual transmission capable of governing editorial decision in the establishing of a critical text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , has, it is true, a narrow foundation. It depends on an evaluation of those variant readings in E which are substitutes for good manuscript readings; and only if, by this evaluation, it is ultimately correct to accept no more than 18 such variants as authoritative, is it valid editorially to reject the other Egoist readings which belong to this group and, furthermore, to conclude by analogy that a great majority, if not all, of the Egoist variants resulting from the omission of manuscript readings, too, are unauthoritative. It is most fortunate, therefore, that—contrary to previous assumptions—there is no need to trust exclusively in the soundness of a logical construct. Rather, it has in fact been possible to trace large fragments of Chapters I and II of the Trieste typescript against which our hypothetical assumptions can be tested. The typewritten fragments of the text of A Portrait come from the possession of Dora Marsden, founder of The Egoist , and still its editor when the first ten installments of Joyce's novel were published. They contain the text for most of these ten installments. Of 68 numbered typewritten pages of Chapter I, only pages 1-15, that is the entire first installment plus three sentences of the second, and the single pages 53 and 59 are missing. Of Chapter II, for which the page numbering starts afresh, pages 1-9 and 17-27, plus six lines of p. 28, are extant, which correspond to the first, the third and part of the fourth Egoist installments of that chapter. The last fragment breaks off in the middle of the last Egoist installment of the novel published under Dora Marsden's editorship. There are 71 pages and six lines of typescript in all. Upon collation against both D and E, a great number of readings, variant and invariant, in the text of these typewritten pages immediately suggest that they are indeed part of the Trieste typescript. Yet wherever there is no significant variation between the text in the typescript and in E, the process of transmission could of course be thought of as reversed. Order and direction of transmission are determined by those readings or typographical characteristics only which are invariant between D and the pages of typescript but variant between these and E. It is thus above all the reproduction in full of Joyce's manuscript system of dashes in dialogue in the typewritten pages, as against the absence of intermediate and final dashes in all dialogue in Chapters I and II in E, 56 which places the text of these pages firmly between that in D and in E and identifies the fragments as part of the Trieste typescript (T). Consequently, such instances of variation between D and T as the apparent, or indeed obvious, misreadings of Joyce's handwriting also attain value as evidence to secure this identification. They demonstrate, furthermore, that T was copied directly from D. That the extant fragments of typescript in their turn were used as printer's copy for E is not merely rendered likely by the circumstances of their preservation, but is also demonstrable from errors of a typographical nature in the typescript, 57 and by a large number of marks (crosses, queries, and the like) which would seem to have been added in the printing-house. 58 When so much has been established, both the D-T and the T-E variance which occurs within the stretches of text preserved can be more closely analysed. In accidentals, D-T and T-E variation is clearly distinguishable. In both chapters, additional commas are very rarely indeed introduced in T. The Chapter I pages add four commas, the Chapter II pages add three. The typical typescript error in punctuation is rather one of omission of commas. 13 manuscript commas are missing in Chapter I, of which some have been restored in print and some not, and 9 commas are missing in Chapter II, only one of which has been restored in E. The adding of commas to the printed text, although comparatively restrained in Chapters I and II, is thus clearly a compositorial commission. The increase in capitalizations, on the other hand, is pretty evenly distributed between T and E, while the printers again are responsible for the greater part, though not all, of the additional hyphenation of compounds in E. By contrast, it is the rare substantive variant that originates in E. What earlier collation established as D-E variance in substantives is in fact seen to be variation between D and T. This is as it should be according to the basic assumptions of our hypothesis for the transmission from D to E of the entire novel, and it is gratifying to find it confirmed for the sections of T preserved. A grouping of the D-E substantive variants, undertaken hypothetically before for the sake of a coherent textual theory, can now be based on firmer evidence. Moreover, to determine the exact source and point of origin of a variant becomes a practical necessity for defining the nature and degree of authority of the recovered intermediary textual witness. The omission from the typed text of words, phrases and sentences presents once again the crucial textual problem. D does not indicate any omissions. On the evidence of the typescript, the likelihood does not increase that they represent authorial, and thus authoritative, cuts at a lost stage of transmission between D and T. As T was demonstrably typed from D, such a lost stage could in any case not be thought of as yet another full transcript of the text intervening between D and T. At the most, the possibility of authorial direction in the form of oral or written instructions to the typist might be considered if the need were felt to make the omissions out as authorial cuts. But not a single variant outside the group of the omissions would help to strengthen any speculatively posited authorial attention to the text between D and T. Even the simple corrections evident in T of incomplete or obviously erroneous manuscript readings could have been made by a typist on his own initiative; it need not be assumed that the author was consulted for them. The correction of one incomplete manuscript reading, indeed, which was not caught by the typist is entered in T in the author's hand ('wondering' [66.23]), thus allowing the inference that the others of its kind in fact were done by the typist and consequently, on the evidence of this group of variants, no authorial correction intervened between D and T. 59 All further circumstantial evidence considered above, moreover, which suggested that the variants due to omission of manuscript readings were errors in typing is in no way invalidated by any new evidence from the typescript. The onus for the considerable degree of deterioration from manuscript to print of the text of A Portrait is still largely on a typist. He had to take all blame in absentia before. Now the extent of his inattention to the text can be more firmly assessed. With respect to omissions, the typewritten pages reveal that errors of omission were corrected, the corrections always being typed in, in only a few instances when they were caught in the course of the typing. A systematic reading by the typist of the finished typescript against copy seems not to have taken place. Beyond that, there is only one instance in the entire 71 pages and six lines of typescript preserved where the author himself caught a typist's omission and corrected it. It is this instance alone which must take all burden of proof, 60 in so far as proof can be supplied by the typescript, that the omission of manuscript matter in print was due to typescript error and does not represent intentional authorial cuts. The manuscript sentence: "Perhaps that was why they were in the square because it was a place where some fellows wrote things for cod" (43.24) is rendered in the typescript as: "Perhaps that was why they were because it was a place. . . .". The author adds 'there' above the typewritten line, indicating the place of insertion by a caret between 'were' and 'because'. Clearly, 'in the square' are words erroneously omitted by the typist. The error was caught by the author (as so many of its kind were not) and corrected without collation against the manuscript. 61 The typescript thus bears marks which unmistakably show that it was read by James Joyce himself, though they indicate at the same time that his reading, too, did not take the form of a thorough collation against the manuscript. This goes some way towards explaining why, as errors, the many omissions of manuscript readings should have been so consistently overlooked. Moreover, few and far between as are the marks which signalize Joyce's presence, they are also proof that his reading (as hypothetically assumed) was perfunctory only, and probably hasty. In the extant fragments of typescript there are only three instances in all of substantive authorial correction. In addition to the insertion of omitted 'wondering', and of 'there' for omitted 'in the square' the third authorial correction is 'Father' &gt; 'Mr' (30.1). That part of our hypothesis which posited a scarcity of authorial corrections among the Egoist readings which replace good manuscript readings would thus also seem to be confirmed by the typescript. As it has already been shown that the text appears to have been given no authorial attention between D and T, it follows that all variants of this kind, too, were introduced by a typist and are non-authoritative, and that authority belongs to those variant readings only which are seen to have been entered in the author's hand in T. On the narrow basis provided by the extant fragments of typescript, this is an argument mainly by negatives. None of the passages of text in Chapter II where authorial correction was assumed are preserved in T, so that it cannot be positively shown that those variants alone are authorial in origin which were hypothetically singled out as such, although it is apparent from as much text as is extant that no other variants replacing good manuscript readings are authorial of which this was not expected. The same is true for the much longer fragment of Chapter I. Of the three variants in this chapter hypothetically assumed to have been authorial, the assumption has been confirmed without reservations for one ('Father' &gt; 'Mr'), and with some modification, not touching the fact of its authorial origin, for a second ('in the square' &gt; 'there'). The third member of the group, however, is still invariant in T: the manuscript 'avenue of chestnuts' leading up to Clongowes is still an 'avenue of chestnuts'. The reading must have been altered between T and E. If it is to be maintained that 'limes' for 'chestnuts' is an authorized variant, an influx of authority in some form must be assumed at a stage of transmission after the typescript was authorially corrected to the extent observable in its extant fragments as here discussed, and before the printed Egoist text as typeset and proofread was published. The assumption as such is strengthened by the observation that 'limes' for 'chestnuts' in Chapter I is not an isolated instance of significant T-E variation. (There is no corresponding variation in the Chapter II fragments.) For the extant text of Chapter I, there is a total of nine substantive T-E variants. In two instances, T copies the manuscript readings correctly and there are marks of the printer's pen or pencil set against them in T which suggest that the subsequent E variants originated in the printinghouse and are therefore unauthorized. In the remaining seven instances, on the other hand, T also varies from D and it is the original manuscript reading which has in each case been restored in E. 62 In three of these seven cases the T variant is an error to which the manuscript reading is the obvious alternative; a compositor or printinghouse proofreader could easily have made the correction. Yet in the remaining four cases the correction of the T error can have been made only from a knowledge of the manuscript reading as restored. There are thus five instances of substantive T-E variation—interestingly enough confined to the second and third Egoist installments—which make it an inevitable conclusion that the text of Chapter I, or part of it, was referred to authority in the course of transmission between extant T (as authorially corrected) and E. In other words, the Egoist text of Chapter I was to some extent authoritatively proofread before publication. One possible explanation of this fact would be that proofsheets of the chapter, or of the two installments concerned, were sent to Joyce in Trieste. No further indication, it is true, derives from a collation of corrected T and E that this was the case, nor is any documentary evidence available from letters or the like to show that Joyce ever proofread any part of the Egoist text. Yet if the typescript used as Egoist printer's copy was the only copy of T which ever existed, the variants observed would allow no other conclusion. 63 If however, T was typed, say, with a carbon copy, and thus existed in duplicate, one might assume that the copy of T which did not serve as printer's copy contained the additional corrections, entered by hand by the author and/or typist, and was used for proofreading by some agent other than the author. No immediate proof is available which of these explanations, if any, is correct. Nevertheless, authoritative proofreading assuredly took place between corrected T and E. It did not broadly affect the text, and the few variants involved assert their authority mainly on their own strength. The hypothetical concept of the transmission of the entire text of A Portrait from D to E, such as it was derived from a comprehensive collation and analysis of these two textual witnesses, is thus in no way invalidated by further investigation of the transmission processes as controllable in those sections of the intermediary textual witness, the typescript, which happen to have been preserved. For most of Chapter I and for substantial fragments of Chapter II, that is for those stretches of text which correspond to the extant pages of typescript, the postulates of our hypothesis have been fully confirmed, and a clear differentiation of the several stages of transmission of the text from manuscript to print is amply indicated. The question which remains to be answered is what further inferences may be drawn for the full text of the novel by extrapolation from the positive facts established about the transmission of the first two chapters. The most important fact not yet considered of the extant fragments of T is that each of the first two chapters was typed by a different typist. This is clear from a difference in spelling habits: in the Chapter II fragments of the typescript, the name of the novel's hero is consistently spelled 'Stephan'; it was probably the author himself who painstakingly changed the spelling back to 'Stephen' in almost every instance. Moreover, Joyce's system of dashes in dialogue is regularly complemented by additional punctuation at the end, and sometimes rather illogically also in the middle, of direct speech in Chapter I, whereas in Chapter II the manuscript punctuation of dialogue is copied faithfully without additional marks of punctuation. Statistics derived from the incidence of substantive variance further corroborate a differentiation of typists. There is an average of 2.3 substantive variants per printed column in the 27.5 columns of Egoist text for Chapter I, as against an average of 3.9 per column for Chapter II. Leaving out of account the 3+5 variants which in Chapters I and II are with some certainty authorial corrections and revisions, the figures are 2.2/3.7. These figures comprise substantive variants of typescript and printinghouse origin. But since it can be positively established that the printinghouse compositors were responsible for only a minority of the substantive D-E variants—in the sections of the text preserved in typescript, the compositors in Chapter I introduced 9 out of 53, or roughly the sixth part of the substantive variants, and in Chapter II 3 out of 29, or approximately only one-tenth—the averages per column of printed text give a fair indication of the relative trustworthiness of the two typists. The Chapter II typist was significantly less faithful to copy in substantives (though more so in accidentals); his spelling 'Stephan' may even suggest that his native tongue was not English. When statistical calculations are extended over the remaining chapters of the novel, it is remarkable that the higher incidence of variation and error per column of printed text is confined to Chapter II. The corresponding figures for Chapters III-V (with and without authorial variants, and giving the typist the benefit of the doubt by assuming that the omissions in the latter part of Chapter III are authorial) are 2.4:2.1/2.35:2.35/2.1:1.9. They are thus very close to the incidence of variation in Chapter I (2.3:2.2). Noting that when the printed text introduces Joyce's dashes in dialogue from halfway through Chapter III onwards, it does so not in the strictly faithful manner of the typescript of Chapter II, but rather according to the pattern of that of Chapter I, combining the dashes with additional punctuation, one is tentatively led to conclude that the identical typist was employed on Chapters I and III-V, while a second person typed Chapter II only. The general uniformity of the kind of variants introduced and errors committed would appear to support the conclusion. The uniformity, it is true, extends over all five chapters. The statistics alone would, in the absence of any part of the typescript, not be very reliable as an aid to differentiating typists, since their figures indicate a varying amount only, and not a difference in nature of variants and errors. But once a second typist for Chapter II has been identified by several aspects of his extant handiwork, it is of no great consequence that he happened to be prone to the same kind of failings towards the manuscript as was the typist for Chapter I. What is important is inferentially to conclude that he was responsible for Chapter II only, and thereupon to recognise that both the statistical figures and the uniform nature of the variants, that is quantitative and qualitative arguments together, go to indicate that Chapters I and III-V in the typescript were the work of one other person, and one only. If, then, this conclusion is correct, it should greatly aid an editor in his evaluation of the total body of the D-E variation in substantives and, in particular, increase the assurance with which he posits that only a small minority of the substantive variants in E are the result of authorial correction and revision of the typescript. Finally, the facts and inferences can be played with to speculate about the relative timing involved in the completion of the several sections of the manuscript and the typescript. By two typists, Chapters I and II could have been typed simultaneously. At least, it is not impossible to conceive that they were begun at about the same time, or else that their typing overlapped for some days, or a week or two, if it was Joyce's intention to get as large a section of the novel as possible to London as quickly as possible after Ezra Pound's enquiry of December 15, 1913, about printable material. But Chapter II was certainly not completed in typescript when Chapter I was, or they would have been dispatched together. Actually, the same typewriter may have been used for both: there are no typed underlinings in either chapter, and parentheses have regularly been substituted by dashes. Thus it is equally possible that they were typed in short succession after each other. It is not known when Chapter II arrived in London. But Chapter III, although belonging to that part of the novel which is assumed to have existed in final form since 1908, did not get there until July 21 (Ellmann, p. 365). Perhaps a second typist was employed on Chapter II because the first one was unavailable between January and July—unless the completion of the typescript for Chapter III was delayed by an interruption in the writing out of the faircopy manuscript between Chapters II and III, or in the course of Chapter III. Only a physical examination of the manuscript itself might throw light on the circumstances under which Chapter III was copied out and typed. On August 1 the war broke out, cutting off almost completely all postal connections between England and Austria. On September 1 Chapter III ran out in The Egoist , and on November 11 Joyce managed to dispatch the typescript of Chapters IV and V via Switzerland. Provided that the typescript was completed in the regular order of the chapters, I would tend to infer that the typing of Chapters III to V proceeded at a fairly even pace between July and October, and consequently that there was no last-minute rush in the writing of the novel itself. The hiatus in publication between September 1 and December 1 has been taken to indicate that The Egoist caught up with James Joyce too soon (Ellmann, p. 365; Anderson, pp. 182 ff.). But surely it was primarily due to the outbreak of the war. It was probably an editorial unwillingness to have to break off in the middle of a chapter in case The Egoist would not be able to continue publication at all which made the installments of Chapter III on August 1, August 15 and September 1 as long as they are. At the rate of publication of the previous chapters, Chapter III would probably have lasted until October. Chapter IV is short, and if it was begun to be typed soon after completion of Chapter III in late July, it ought to have been ready sometime in August and could, but for the war, have been dispatched to London to succeed Chapter III without gap in The Egoist . After Chapter IV, there was still Chapter V to be typed, which is by far the longest chapter, constituting almost one-third of the entire novel. It is the state of its text in E which indicates that it was probably completed in typescript under no special time pressure. It has the lowest incidence of substantive variation and error and, moreover, it was given greater authorial attention in the typescript than any of the previous chapters. By contrast, Chapter IV is perhaps the only chapter which appears not to have been authorially corrected at all. Had it, by November, been sitting about in typescript for so long that Joyce in the end forgot to read it? Or was Chapter IV perchance the last of the chapters to be written? It is perhaps significant that it is the only chapter of which several of the faircopy manuscript pages still show signs of thorough stylistic revision. It is also the chapter which Joyce in July 1915 claims to remember so well as to be able to restore the censored sentences without the aid of his manuscript. A thorough analysis of the manuscript might throw light on the question, and also quite generally serve as a test to whether the preceding speculative inferences about the successive completion of manuscript and typescript are tenable. The Book Editions Our final discussion must be brief of the stages of transmission of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man from the first printing in The Egoist to the 1924 Jonathan Cape edition. The publishing history has essentially been dealt with by Chester G. Anderson. He has also considered many of the editorially relevant facts and inferences to be derived from it in his discussion of the Egoist tearsheets which served as copy for H, and the Y corrections of H for B (see pp. 186 ff., 196 ff.). In so far as a modification of his views proved necessary, this has been given in the course of our analysis of EC-W, YTW and HB. Beyond that, it may suffice to summarize somewhat categorically to what extent the text of the novel as published in H and B may be accepted as authoritative. With respect to substantive readings, all those corrections and revisions represent a final authorial intention editorially to be respected which James Joyce himself undertook in full view of the text as transmitted invariant from the manuscript. There are no problems here in so far as the several rounds of authorial attention to the text are documented in EC-A and Y. The one question not previously considered is whether the Y corrections are the only stage at which the author took influence on the text for B. There are at least two substantive variants in B which would seem to warrant a closer investigation. At 215.27, the text in B reads "When they passed through the passage beside Kildare house . . .", as against ". . . beside the royal Irish academy . . ." in H, and at 96.11 'ineffectualness' (H) is altered to 'ineffectiveness' in B. Neither Y nor HB contain directions for these changes. But as late as November 25th, 1917, more than two months after the Southport printers had begun setting up B, Harriet Weaver was writing to Joyce: "All your corrections have been made, including those you asked for in your last letter." A careful scrutiny of all H-B variants, still to be undertaken, must endeavour to ascertain which were the additional changes which Joyce had requested; there can be little doubt that at least the first of the two alterations quoted were among them. With respect to accidentals, the situation created by the author's corrections prior to H and to B is somewhat more complex, and for an editor methodically quite intriguing. When faced with the close to 600 additional commas in the text of the Egoist serialisation, Joyce went about restoring the light punctuation of his manuscript with considerable determination. This process continued into Y. His paramount concern doubtless was for the rhythms of his text, the essential qualities of which—"to liberate from the personalised lumps of matter that which is their individuating rhythm"—had been early adumbrated in the very first paragraph of the narrative essay "A Portrait of the Artist" of 1904. Yet for the flexible rhythms of his novel, its semicolons and its colons, placed and distinguished from each other with great subtlety in the manuscript, are as important as its commas. It is surely an indication of the author's increasing distance in time from a state of complete immersion in the work that, in the course of his corrections, he was much more permissive towards the printers' alterations of the original semicolons and colons. As for the commas, of course, many of those added by printinghouse compositors were left standing in the text despite all authorial efforts to eradicate them. There can be no question for an editor but that he reproduce in a critical text as closely as is at all possible the manuscript pattern of punctuation. However, Joyce's attention to the accidentals of the text as printed in fact took two directions. As has been noted above, his reduction of next to all capitalization and his preference in print for compounds written together as one word is tantamount to a restyling of the text with respect to these accidentals. In so far as it can be positively ascertained that they were made by the author, the changes are part of the total authoritative correction and revision of E and H. As such, they invalidate, in part, the pattern of the manuscript inscription which cannot be editorially restored whenever positive authorial direction is given to depart from it. Neither, however, should a critical editor (as opposed perhaps to a publisher's editor) for the sake of a new typographical consistency, and in an attempt to finish what the author began, go beyond his alterations. Quite a number of original capitalizations and word divisions in fact survived Joyce's restyling. These cannot but be left untouched in a critical text, which will thus, in the treatment of accidentals, appear thoroughly inconsistent. 64 Inconsistency of the kind just advocated, however, is really an expression of editorial consistency based on a systematic enquiry into the extent of authority in each substantive textual witness. With regard to Joyce's Portrait , such consistency should be firmly extended to the last of the substantive texts, that of the Jonathan Cape edition of 1924 (J). Because its proofsheets have not been preserved, it presents greater textual problems than H and B. What attention James Joyce gave to it can only be inferred from external facts and the internal evidence of textual variants. A complete collation of B and J to ascertain all internal evidence has not yet been undertaken. But more is to be known of the external circumstances pertaining to this last phase of authoritative publication of the novel than has hitherto been realised. As mentioned by Anderson, Joyce reported to Harriet Weaver from Saint-Malo on August 16, 1924, that he had been reading revises for Jonathan Cape for ten days and had dispatched the proofs that day. 65 The company ledgers show that the book went into print on August 28. 66 Antedating the August letter is a letter to Harriet Weaver of July 11, 1924, also from Saint-Malo. It states: "Then Mr Cape and his printers gave me trouble. They set the book with perverted commas and I insisted on their removal by the sergeant-at-arms. Then they underlined passages which they thought undesirable. But as you will see from the enclosed: They were and, behold, they are not" ( Letters , III, 99 f.). I take this to mean that Joyce had received two sets of proofs from Jonathan Cape before July 11. The context of the letter ("I left Paris in the usual whirl of confusion . . .") suggests that the second set arrived in Paris after Joyce's eye operation of June 11 and before he left for Saint-Malo on July 6 or 7. Probably this was the set which he showed to Sylvia Beach who records her "amazement at the printer's queries in the margins". 67 The author's refusal to cut at the request of the printers had apparently been accepted by July 11. "The enclosed" in the letter to Harriet Weaver would seem to have been some token of consent from Cape to publish the text entire. The question is whether Joyce voiced his refusal by letter only or in a note accompanying the return of the corrected second proofs. Should he indeed not have had the time or energy to read them in the "whirl of confusion" before his departure from Paris, one might be left to wonder whether the proofs with the printers' underlinings were the revises which were finally not read until August. But Joyce was not only habitually prompt in matters regarding the publishing of his books, but, as the letter of July 11 also records, he was able after the eye operation to see to the proofing of the installments of the French translation of Ulysses due to appear in the review Commerce (Ellmann, p. 573). It is therefore likely that the second proofs were returned before he left for Saint-Malo, however superficially they may have been read. If this was so, the revises which he corrected for ten days in August were the third round of proofs read on the Jonathan Cape text. James Joyce, then, obviously took full advantage of the one and only opportunity he was ever given to see A Portrait through the press. This does of course not mean that the edition into which his efforts went ten years after the completion of the manuscript presents a text to override all previous texts. The inevitable deterioration of the text in ten years of transmission has not been remedied in the edition of 1924. Nor has the text been extensively revised. Even a cursory perusal of J will satisfy an editor that the authorial proofreading was not by any means on the scale of Joyce's reading and revising in proof of the text of Ulysses . The comparison with the later work indeed emphasizes the remarkable reticence against change and revision which Joyce showed towards the text of A Portrait at every stage of correction. By analogy to the earlier rounds of authorial correction of the text, it should be expected that the proofreading of J which did take place affected both accidentals and substantives. That Joyce paid attention to the accidentals is proved, for example, when J, restoring the manuscript punctuation, reads: "What is this your name is?" (50.1) against the typescript error perpetuated through B: "What is this? Your name is?" But it is an exceptional case when it can be proved on internal evidence that the author was responsible for a variant in accidentals. Generally, the lack of documentation prevents editorial acceptance of such variation. The substantive variants in J, on the other hand, are susceptible to evaluation by which it should be possible satisfactorily to identify the authorial corrections and revisions. For example, the manuscript sentence: "The doomsday was at hand." (113.11) was transmitted invariant through H. B, by the authorial direction of Y, changed to 'Doomsday', yet J reverts to the manuscript wording 'The doomsday' in what must be considered as the author's final decision on this reading, overruling the revision of Y. Similarly, the typescript error 'fellows' at 43.19 was transmitted unnoticed through B. J restores the singular 'fellow' of the manuscript. Finally, a subtle revision at 77.35, 'moment' for 'movement', indicates the author's care in proofreading. With 'movement' the manuscript had picked up 'a movement of impatience' of 77.28, which itself is a recollection of 74.28 and is only incidentally woven into the description of the situation of tension in the conversation between Heron, Wallis and Stephen on p. 77. Only in the 1924 re-reading of the text did Joyce himself realise that the proper reference of line 77.35 should be to 'a shaft of momentary anger' of 77.12. When all authoritative stages of the transmission of the novel have been analysed in detail, a comprehensive textual hypothesis to govern editorial decision in the preparation of a critical text may be formulated in a revised set of directions: 1. Base a critical text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man on the holograph manuscript (D) of 1913/14. 2. In accidentals, accept the manuscript system of punctuation. Follow authorial directions as contained in EC-A and Y to restyle the manuscript capitalizations and word divisions. 3. In substantives, accept all authorial correction and revision as documented in the fragments of T, in EC-A and Y, or as ascertained by inference from an evaluation of the total body of substantive variance between each of the authoritative editions. Except for the corrections of incomplete manuscript readings in E (in so far as they are not manifest miscorrections or stylesheet rectifications of grammar and syntax), reject all non-auhoritative variation in substantives. With our present knowledge of the publishing history and the nature of the textual transmission of the novel, a critical edition, and maybe even a definitive text, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is not impossible to attain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . The definitive text, corrected from the Dublin holograph by Chester G. Anderson and edited by Richard Ellmann (1964). 2 Chester G. Anderson, "The Text of James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ." Neuphilologische Mitteilungen 65 (1964), 160-200. (Quoted as Anderson.) This is a but slightly revised version of the Introduction to Chester G. Anderson, " A Portrait . . . Critically Edited . . .," unpubl. Ph.D. dissertation, Faculty of Philosophy, Columbia University, 1962. 3 It is described in much detail, which often corrects assumptions by Anderson (pp. 190 ff.), in chapters 5 and 6 of Jane Lidderdale and Mary Nicholson, Dear Miss Weaver (1970). (Quoted as Lidderdale.) 4 The exact number delivered was 768. See Lidderdale, p. 128. 5 Contrary to the nomenclature in John J. Slocum and Herbert Cahoon, A Bibliography of James Joyce , 1882-1941 (1953), it is bibliographically correct only to speak of one first edition, the first impression of which was published in two separate simultaneous issues variant merely in the two distinct states of the title-page, and issued in two different bindings. The variant title-pages are both conjugate in their sheets and were probably printed by stop-press alteration from separate plates for which the identical typesetting of author and title was used. There is distinct type-damage to four separate letters (the 'e' in 'the', the 'a' in 'a', the 'M' in 'Man' and the 'C' in 'JOYCE') which positively secures the identification. Owing to the absence of B. W. Huebsch's publisher's device from the title-page of the London issue, its typographical lay-out differs in the wider spacing between the two lines each for author and title: the lines 'BY | JAMES JOYCE' have as a block been moved further down the page. Beyond that, the variance of the title-pages is merely in the alternative imprints. This first edition was never corrected but for a few minor alterations in its plates and ran out in 1950 in its 44th impression, while a second American edition, editorially corrected by Harry Levin, began its run in 1947 and went into many impressions and several separate issues, American and English. The edition named by Slocum-Cahoon 'The First English Edition, English sheets' (1918) is in truth the second edition of the novel, and it is the 'first English edition' only in so far as it is the fountainhead of the authorially corrected English line of the text. Of the fifth impression of the original American first edition there was in 1921 once more a separate issue for The Egoist Ltd. in London. This is not the 'third edition' (nor, of course, the fifth). Bibliographically, the reset Jonathan Cape publication of 1924 is the true third edition. As it is reset from the London edition of 1918, it might under the special circumstances governing the textual transmission of this novel be termed the second English edition. It had numerous impressions until it was replaced in 1956 by the reset Jonathan Cape illustrated edition (the third in England). 6 These have been seen and described by Chester G. Anderson: see Anderson, pp. 186-190. 7 Lidderdale, pp. 92, 99, and 103 gives vivid accounts of when and how Miss Weaver was forced to give in to the demands for excision; with respect to the sentences omitted near the end of Chapter IV, Harriet Weaver herself wrote in the margin of Joyce's letter to her of July 24, 1915: ". . . the managers of the firm objected to certain expressions. . . . That was why the Egoist changed printers." James Joyce, Letters , II, 355, fn. 8 James Joyce to Harriet Weaver, 24 July, 1915. Letters , II, 355. 9 The latter correction refers to Chapter V. These were perhaps the two errata of which Harriet Weaver enclosed a slip in her letter to B. W. Huebsch of July 24, 1916. 10 Partridge &amp; Cooper Ltd., whose name appears in the Egoist colophon, were a subsidiary of James Truscott and Son. These were the managers whom Harriet Weaver had to contend with. Cf. above, note 7, and Lidderdale, p. 91. 11 With reference keyed to the Viking [Anderson] text, the passages in question are: p. 7.13-14; 43.11-18; 44.32-35; 137.24-30; 138.6-9; 151.5-9; 192.8-11; 200.3-5; 205. 22-28; 206.30-32; 211.29-31; 212.5-7; 242.27-30. 12 P. 98.35-99.10 and p. 115.31-116.7. The same (?) indelible pencil has bracketed a part-column on p. 71, Feb. 16, 1914 (i.e. Viking [Anderson] p. 22.6-37), but there is no link in contents between this passage and the other two. 13 The full sheet either was cut from the beginning, serving as a divider between the chapters and a protective end cover, or else was used by Joyce as a folder for Chapter II, in which case the British Museum binder cut it apart and inadvertently turned fol. 27 upside down. 14 To Professor Giorgio Melchiori of Rome, who was most conveniently at hand in the British Museum reading room when I made this discovery, I am grateful for confirming my guess as to the nature of the document and for supplying the further information here given. 15 Sic ; should be: 1 and 15 August, 1 September and 1 and 15 December. 16 Cf. Anderson, p. 190. 17 Letters , I, 80; 'the first half' can refer only to Chapters I and II, as no more had yet been published in July 1914. 18 Letter to Ezra Pound of March 17th, 1915. Letters , III, 508. 19 Ibid . 20 Late in March 1915 ( c. 29 March) Ezra Pound wrote: "Dear James Joyce: I took the final chapter of your novel to Grant Richards this a.m." ( Pound/Joyce Letters , ed. F. Read, London 1967, p. 33). In a letter of April 22nd to Joyce, Harriet Weaver specifies that "Mr Pound sent Mr. Grant Richards . . . the part of the M.S. of your novel which has not yet been set up, together with a complete set of the numbers of 'The Egoist' in which it has appeared up to date. I asked for the M.S. to be returned by May 20th. This would give Mr. Richards two months in which to consider it." For access to those of Harriet Weaver's letters to James Joyce which concern the publishing of A Portrait , in photostats of the holograph originals, I am grateful to Miss Jane Lidderdale. While quotations from them here and below are according my own transcription, reference should be made to the edition of John Firth, "Harriet Weaver's Letters to James Joyce 1915-1920", SB 20 (1967), 151-188. 21 See quotation fn. 20. 22 Cf. Richard Ellmann, James Joyce (New York 1959), p. 413. 23 Cf. Lidderdale, pp. 104f. 23a A renewed scrutiny of the inserted galley slip reveals an ink stroke in the margin about half-way down the column which does not stand against a correction to be made. It looks like the line-count strokes of Chapters I-IV, but divides off line 2254 of Chapter V as printed. However, if it may be assumed that the cumulation of 53 lines of italicized verse in the preceding sections of the chapter was disregarded in the count, the marking would be seen to stand against line 2201 of the regular text, reflecting a next to faultless line-count in hundreds. The observation would help to argue for the correctness of our assumptions about the fates of EC-W. 24 Harriet Weaver had submitted the novel to printers before, while Pinker was still searching for a publisher (see Lidderdale, chapter 6 passim ); refusals from printers were coming in ever faster, so she may for some time have been circulating two copies of the text. 25 The Selected Letters of Ezra Pound, 1907-1941 . ed. D. D. Paige ([1950] 1971) p. 85. 26 Miss Lidderdale's discussion of the dates and events leading up to Huebsch's publication of A Portrait ( Dear Miss Weaver , chapter 6 passim ) differs radically from Anderson's hypotheses (Anderson, pp. 190ff.). Being much more fully based on documentary evidence, her account serves as my frame of reference. 27 Anderson, p. 188 f. is aware of the facts. Curiously, he does not recognise the bearing they have on determining the provenance of EC-A. 28 Harriet Weaver to Huebsch on July 24, 1916. Letters , I, 93. 29 The reference is here repeatedly to the unpublished Weaver-Huebsch correspondence. I gratefully acknowledge being given permission to use it.—It seems safe to say that Huebsch indeed never received the Marshall copy. For had it passed into his hands, he would, even though not printing from it, have handed it over to John Quinn to whom Joyce in 1917 sold all material relating to the first book edition which Huebsch held, and it would now be found in the Slocum Collection at Yale. 30 See the account of the events in London on September 6th and 7th, 1916, in Lidderdale, p. 125; and compare with the letter from Harriet Weaver to Huebsch of September 7th as quoted by Anderson, p. 190. This letter is now found attached to a complete set of tearsheets known as EC-B. Nowhere is there any documentary evidence, however, that 'EC-B' was an integral set of Egoist tearsheets from the outset. Rather, from the facts as they now begin to emerge I would infer that the one and only copy which ever became an identifiable unit was the printer's copy. Not even this copy, however, secured integrity until the printers stamped its sheets with serial numbers. It had none before and did probably not then, for example, contain the holograph insert (leaf no. 35). The other sets (EC-B and EC-C) had no natural integrity as physical objects until they became identifiable as catalogued units in the Slocum Collection. I suggest that, at various times, portions of the text (chapters and inserts, sections annotated and not annotated) were shuffled and reshuffled between them, the last time probably by Mr. Slocum himself. For the Quinn sale catalogue still speaks of three sets, each 'containing manuscript corrections by the author and Miss Weaver' (quoted by Anderson, p. 187). But EC-C now has no corrections. 31 Incidentally, she also gave her own complete run of The Egoist which the British Museum library did not possess before. Cf. Lidderdale, p. 425. 32 364 is the number of corrections counted by Cahoon in Joyce's manuscript list (Y). I count entries (364) and corrections to be made (365; two separate instances of 'public-house' &gt; 'publichouse' are given one entry). These corrections sometimes involve more than one change. Anderson counts 373 changes (cf. footnote, p. 162). Attempting to apply his criteria, I count at least 379 changes. Yet I believe we are all describing the same body of corrections. 33 Anderson has no real ground for assuming (footnote, p. 197) that YW was written before Y: Y was completed by April 10th, YW was compiled between April 18th and May 2nd, arriving in New York on May 15th (see below). 34 The note, however, was written at some later date, after 1924; perhaps even as late as 1951. 35 The date they were mailed to Huebsch, which is authentic, is suggestive: on August 16, the Brighton printers who at first were going to print the English edition retracted their offer. Thus, Harriet Weaver—despairing momentarily that the book would ever be printed in England—may have wished that all corrections were in the hands of the publisher who alone thus far had the text of A Portrait in print. In the event, of course, only the second Egoist Press edition and its descendants ever incorporated Joyce's 'nearly 400' corrections. 36 As far as the events go which lead up to finding a printer in England for the second edition, Miss Lidderdale ( Dear Miss Weaver , pp. 139 ff.) has drawn upon the Weaver-Huebsch correspondence and largely recorded the relevant details. 37 Harriet Weaver to B. W. Huebsch, April 18th, 1917. 38 B. W. Huebsch to Harriet Weaver, July 9th, 1917. 38a Pinker must have kept the corrections on file in yet another typescript copy; for the manuscript original (Y) was sold to John Quinn sometime in June, 1917; by July 10th, Joyce had received Quinn's acknowledgement ( Letters , I, 104). 39 HB is apparently not identical with the copy marked up and given before August 16th, 1917, to the Pike's Fine Art Press in Brighton to print from. They returned a book with 'passages marked in blue pencil' to be 'modified or removed'. (Lidderdale, p. 142). There are no traces of bluepencil markings in the Bodley volume. The discrepancy in the number of corrections between the handwritten list sent to Huebsch on August 16 (15 corrections plus removal of one typing error) and the additional entries in pencil in YTW (17 corrections plus removal of two obvious typing errors) may have its explanation here. The fifteen corrections in the handwritten list may have been the result of annotating the copy for Pike's, the two additional ones may have been added to YTW in preparation of the printer's copy for Johnson's of Southport. As Harriet Weaver then spotted another six misprints and hyphenation errors in the course of annotating HB which were never entered in YTW, it must remain an open question —until all relevant documents can be reexamined in preparation of a critical edition—whether it is merely a happy coincidence that YW and YTW concur in the number of 17 corrections in excess of Joyce's authentic 365. 40 To complete the record, a set of pencilled notations on the back flyleaf (verso) should be observed: '26-41 234-246 280-292 for Sesame book 1942'. If taken as page references, '26-41' comprises the greater part of the Christmas dinner scene in Chapter I; '234-246' the conversation between Stephen, Davin and Lynch until just before the esthetic theory section in Chapter V; and '280-292' the final conversation with Cranly. I have not investigated the relevance of these jottings. 41 The corresponding section of the typescript which served as printer's copy for The Egoist happens to survive. Curiously, the typist first spelled 'revery' according to the manuscript, but the final 'y' was altered in ink to 'ie' by an undeterminable agent. Joyce himself did sporadically enter corrections in ink in the typescript, but the 'ie' does not appear to be in his hand. The spelling 'reverie' occurs several times in The Egoist . It was successfully eradicated by Joyce himself in all instances but the present one. It is highly probable that the failure to observe his Y instruction at B: 87.9 was spotted and amended by him when he proofread J. 42 The texts in the editions of Harry Levin (in The Portable James Joyce and elsewhere; cf. Anderson, p. 167) and of Anderson/Ellmann (1964) are both conflated texts. The latter in particular, which draws on the manuscript, albeit in a not readily controllable manner which on analysis proves to be unsystematic, provides—in the true technical sense of the word—a contaminated text. 43 Cf. W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text." Studies in Bibliography , 3 (1950-51), 19-36. 44 See the discussion of the Jonathan Cape edition below. 45 I summarize mainly Anderson's findings. 46 It should be noted here that no scholar with bibliographic and paleographic expertise has yet investigated the Dublin holograph. Until it has been fully described and analysed, neither the above dates can be given with full assurance, nor is it possible to say whether or not our present conception of how the text of the novel evolved will need to be modified. 47 The figures for the Egoist variants here and below derive from double collation (D-E, D-J) which, though done with all possible care, has not been counter-checked. They should therefore be taken as approximations to indicate relations. 48 To assert that in E "printinghouse stylesheets triumphed almost completely over the copy in punctuation, hyphening, capitalization, and other accidentals" (Anderson, p. 185) is much too sweeping a statement. As regards hyphenation and capitalization it is not true. 49 Cf. Anderson, pp. 178 and 185. 50 I count at least 106 instances of such omission, equalling almost exactly one-third of the total of D-E substantive variance: 19 instances in Chapter I, 28 in II, 22 in III, 9 in IV and 28 in V. 51 Page/line references are to the 1964 Viking printed text as used in its 1968 reprint in: James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . Text, Criticism, Notes. Ed. Chester G. Anderson, 1968 (The Viking Critical Library). The quotations, however, give the manuscript readings unless otherwise indicated. 52 This is a fascinating variant. Stephen also notes "the proud conscious movement of her perfumed head" which accompanies the undoing of the gown. Moreover, the next paragraph in the text makes it clear that Stephen and the young woman stand apart in her room: ". . . she came over to him and embraced him. . . ." "Watching her as he undid her gown", therefore, which very clearly is the manuscript reading, appears to be a genuine Freudian slip of the author. It need of course not have been corrected by him. A typist or compositor would have been capable of spotting the inconsistency. 53 This revision, to avoid a quibble on Dixon's signet ring, is comparable to the E→H authorial change of 'trunk' &gt; 'body' at 201.14 to avoid a pun on the preceding "whinny of an elephant". 54 Anderson (p. 177) singles out this passage as one of his examples. 55 These are provisional rules, as the facts and inferences concerning the subsequent rounds of authorial correction by which they must be augmented and modified have not yet been discussed. Yet they are also the central rules for establishing a critical text, as the results of a comprehensive analysis of the body of D-E variance must form the basis for any editorial hypothesis and procedure. It may be appropriate therefore in their light to indicate statistically whether "the definitive text, corrected from the Dublin holograph . . . published in 1964 by The Viking Press, Inc." has a claim to being definitive. Of the total of substantive variants, that is 317 by our count, 29 (by our count) are corrections in E of manuscript error. This leaves 288 instances on which editorial decision must operate. Giving the editors the benefit of the doubt in the case of the possible six authorial cuts in Chapter III, we find that in 158 out of the 288 instances editorial decision follows the rules here postulated, while in 130 instances it goes against them. The ratio of (what we would regard as) correct to incorrect is thus 55%:45%. Taking into account that several 'correct' decisions were in fact anticipated by the author in the course of his repeated subsequent corrections of the text, this is tantamount to a flat 50:50 ratio of hit and miss. Corresponding figures for the treatment of accidentals—which by reason of Joyce's fairly systematic later restyling of hyphenations and capitalizations could in any case not be based on the D-E variation—have not been worked out. Nor has the treatment in the Viking text of substantive variance in the later editions (H, B, J) been systematically analysed. The impression that it, too, is somewhat haphazard—and in particular so with regard to the J variants on which hypothetical inference must again operate—stems from cursory observation only. It would seem that these facts and conditions are due to the lack of a comprehensive and logically consistent hypothesis of the transmission of the text of A Portrait from the Dublin holograph (1913/14) to the third book edition (Jonathan Cape, 1924). This lack prevents the 1964 Viking edition from fulfilling the standards of a definitive text. 56 See above, pp. 25-27. 57 In particular, the typewriter used seems to have had no key for underlining. The underlinings in T which copy underlinings in D to indicate italics in print were done by hand and are missing in all those places in T where E fails to italicize. 58 This discussion is based on xerox copies of the extant pages which were kindly put at my disposal by Mrs Elaine Bate who now owns the originals, and to whom I am grateful for permission to use the copies for the purposes of this article. Since the article went to press, I have had the opportunity of inspecting the fragments themselves. They are the ribbon-copy typescript originals, on white typewriting paper 22.5 x 28.4 cm., uniformly watermarked CROXLEY MANIFEST BANK | LONDON under a rampant lion, facing left, which holds in its front paws a standard, unfolding over its head and bearing the inscription LION BRAND. The ribbon ink, originally of a blackish colour, has been affected by damp and has largely turned purple. Each of the chapters separately was once stapled together very close to the left paper edge. Every sheet shows holes in the upper right-hand corner which appear to be the marks of the compositor's copy-holder. The rust-marks of paper clips indicate that the fragmentation of the typescript is of an early date, in all probability resulting from the manuscript's handling in the printinghouse. The authorial corrections can without much difficulty be isolated from the several stages of annotation in evidence. Page II.17, which is the first leaf of the last of the extant fragments, bears the inscription in watery-blue ink "Portrait of The Artist as a young Man | by | James Joyce." The handwriting is Ezra Pound's. The Dublin holograph, which I have also meanwhile been able to inspect, shows a series of pencil marks throughout Chapter I which in ten instances divide off page-beginnings of the typescript, and in two instances specify an (authorial?) re-paragraphing of the text, carried out in the typescript. 59 If it could be assumed that the conditions under which the typescript came about remained fairly constant throughout the five chapters, one would expect to find those corrections of incomplete manuscript readings in Chapter V which appear to be clearly authorial similarly to have been written into the typescript. This would agree with the evidence from authorial correction/revision and definitely indicate one round of authorial attention to Chapter V only. 60 Proof, that is, as distinct from 'first-degree' inference from facts such as the inscription of the words on the manuscript pages which were observed earlier to render plausible the explanation that the omissions were typist's errors; or 'second-degree' inference to the same effect, taking the form of conclusions drawn by analogy from an analysis of a different group of variants which were inferentially also declared to be non-authorial. 61 As it happens, 'there' seems on literary grounds to be a definite improvement over 'in the square', referring as it does to both outdoor and indoor locations in that square. The evidence of T creates a paradoxical situation, even an editor's dilemma. 'There', it is true, is confirmed to be authorial, as was hypothetically assumed before the T fragments came to light. At the same time, it is revealed not as a revision undertaken in view of the original reading, but as a spontaneous correction of a typist's error. As an instance of alternative phrasing it was never intended to replace, but rather to restore the reading which had accidentally got lost. What on first sight appears to be an authorial second thought is really an attempt to recover the wording of a first thought. Editorially this means that the original reading 'in the square' should be given preference over the authorial correction 'there', contrary to the general rule by which authorial corrections should replace original readings in a critical text, and despite the subjective judgment that 'there' be preferable to 'in the square' in its context. The editorial decision to adhere to textual logic over literary judgement is inevitable because the situation is not unique in the course of the transmission of A Portrait : when reading the E text for H, and H for B, Joyce belatedly spotted several further typescript errors of omission which he corrected without recourse to his manuscript. The results of his correction always differ from the original readings, though never except in the present case for the better. 62 These seven instances are: father &gt; uncle &gt; father (26.11); he had got &gt; got &gt; he had got (28.8); or &gt; [ om .] &gt; or (32.5); Let it &gt; let us &gt; let it (32.8); opinions &gt; opinion &gt; opinions (34.14); MacManus &gt; MacManns &gt; MacManus (38.27); about it &gt; about &gt; about it (53.1). The variant chestnuts &gt; chestnuts &gt; limes occurs at 24.10. 63 If it were assumed that as much text as made up the first three Egoist installments was set up at once by the printers on receiving Chapter I in manuscript, then it would be possible to imagine that proofs of installments two and three were passed to and fro between England and Trieste in the last days of January/early days of February, 1914, while the first Egoist installment of February 2nd was already appearing. The change chestnuts &gt; limes is involved, which is identically repeated in Chapters II and III. To ascertain when, where, and by what agent it was introduced into the final Egoist text in its first instance would carry implications for the timing of the completion of both the authorial faircopy and of the typescript for all of Chapter II, and the beginning, at least, of Chapter III. 64 It is well to emphasize, however, that it appears to have been James Joyce's own concern for a pleasing typographical appearance of his text in print which motivated his changes of such accidentals as capitalizations and word divisions. With this in mind, it may be recalled that the question was raised and left open above (p. 27) whether consistency in the treatment of accidentals should in fact be extended to the adoption of the manuscript system of dashes in direct speech. On pragmatic grounds, I would defer a decision in this matter until, by way of a practical experiment, a few sample pages were set up in type so as to show whether both printers and readers could within reason be asked to cope in full with the Joycean unorthodoxy of punctuation in dialogue. Robert Scholes in "Some Observations on the Text of Dubliners : 'The Dead'" ( SB 15 [1962], pp. 200 f.), discusses the matter of Joyce's dashes in Dubliners and the later works.

      <field name="heading_text">Bibliography and Science by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement , commenting in 1972 on two bibliographical annuals, remarked, "To argue about the scientific nature of bibliography now is surely to pursue a red herring." 1 I could not agree more. When I observed a few years ago, "All that 'scientific' can mean when applied to bibliographical analysis and textual study is 'systematic,' 'methodical,' and 'scholarly,'" 2 I was only repeating what a number of others have said and what many more must believe. It seems obvious that the word "scientific," when used to describe bibliography—as it has been off and on for more than a century—does not mean the same thing as when it is applied to physics, say, or chemistry. Apparently the issue cannot be dismissed so easily, however, for there have been several recent essays—notably those by D. F. McKenzie, James Thorpe, Peter Davison, and Morse Peckham 3 —which take up fundamental questions regarding the connections between science and bibliography. In a sense one must agree with the TLS that "it is perhaps a pity that he [McKenzie] revived the old argument about the scientific nature of bibliography"; at the same time, the existence of this group of essays suggests that the issue is not a dead one, and the TLS admits that the matter is "currently very much in the air." Actually, of course, what is in the air is an attempt to clarify the nature of bibliography as a discipline, and what is a pity is that the focus on science may only serve to confuse the central question. Both "science" and "bibliography" have many different meanings, and, when the two words are joined, the possibilities for confusion are multiplied. It is in this sense that the issue may be regarded as nonexistent, for "scientific bibliography" can mean almost anything, and arguments about it may amount to no more than knocking down straw men. Self-examination, though, is presumably a healthy thing, and bibliography will no doubt profit, as it has in the past, from soul-searching. It may be that bibliographers, at one stage, needed to overemphasize the scientific aspect of their work as a means of calling attention to, and insisting upon, its rigorous and scholarly nature, and that they have now reached a stage where they feel an urge to redress the balance. Bibliography—like many of the so-called "social sciences" (and I am not at this point claiming that it is a social science)—has been somewhat uneasy about its own identity, and it would not be surprising to find that attempts to define it have followed a pendulum-like course. Current discussion which questions in various ways the notion that bibliography is "scientific" may eventually lead—if a debate about "science" itself does not get in the way—to more fruitful analysis of the relations between one kind of bibliographical inquiry and another and of the procedures appropriate to each. In supposing that there is little to be gained by further discussion of how "scientific" bibliography is, I am not complaining about the general direction in which these recent articles are moving but about their circuitous path. It is easy to understand why bibliographers have had a tendency to proclaim the scientific nature of what they were doing. For one thing, they have wanted, especially during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to demonstrate that bibliography is a scholarly pursuit, to be distinguished from a merely dilettante concern for book collecting. In their zeal to show the respectability of their relatively new discipline, bibliographers were naturally tempted to play up the aspects of their work that could be compared to science, for the spectacular accomplishments of the physical sciences made "science" glamorous and gave particular advertising value to the word. This temptation has been intensified by the fact that bibliography has been associated most closely with the study of literature and that bibliographers are frequently members of English departments who assume that, since much of their work seems more objective than literary criticism, it is somehow scientific. The misunderstanding which occasionally exists between bibliographers and other members of English departments seems to turn on the matter of "science": the bibliographer often makes extravagant claims for the definiteness of his conclusions and may feel flattered to think that he is a scientist of sorts; certain literary scholars, on the other hand, believe that imagination and insight are unnecessary in the search for scientific facts and assume that bibliographical work is on a lower intellectual plane than literary criticism. Both are wrong in their understanding of science; 4 but the fact remains that it has become a cliché, in the context of literary studies, to regard bibliography as scientific in some way. Any such tradition has a grain of truth at its center: obviously there is something more "factual" about bibliography than about literary criticism. But the usefulness of science as an analogy has led some people to take the claims for the scientific status of bibliography more literally or in a more precisely detailed sense than was originally intended. I think that a glance at the ways in which science has been linked with bibliography ("the scientific analogy") 5 over the years will reveal the shifting meanings of the two terms, the repetitiveness of the discussions, and the growing tendency to be critical of the comparison itself. And perhaps this kind of survey can provide a perspective from which to view the current situation. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I During much of the nineteenth century "bibliography" was understood to mean what we would now regard as "reference bibliography" 7 (or "enumerative bibliography")—that is, it was concerned with the intellectual content of books, with preparing lists of books on particular subjects, with the classification of knowledge and the arrangement of libraries. 8 Thomas Hartwell Horne, in An Introduction to the Study of Bibliography (1814), went somewhat further and included discussion of the materials of books and the history of printing; but when he referred, in his preface, to "the infant science of Bibliography," he obviously meant nothing more than "the classification of books as a field of knowledge." 9 The use of "science" in the general sense of "systematic knowledge" recurs in most of the nineteenth-century discussions. It is explicit, for example, in Reuben A. Guild's The Librarian's Manual (1858), which defined "bibliography" as "the Science or Knowledge of Books" (p. 3). That he equated this science primarily with checklists is evident when he went on to say, "In Great Britain Bibliography as a Science has received less Attention than upon the Continent, although valuable Works have been produced by Horne and Lowndes, Dibdin and Watt" (p. 5). His view of bibliography as a " practical Science" (p. 5) was still essentially the same two decades later when he wrote an article entitled "Bibliography as a Science," in which "bibliography" really means "librarianship." 10 Similarly, E. Fairfax Taylor, in the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1875), though he included some account of printing history under "Bibliography," defined his subject as "the science of books, having regard to their description and proper classification"—using "description," in the sense standard at the time, to mean a recording of the basic facts considered necessary to identify a book (those we would now think appropriate for a checklist). 11 It is generally recognized that a new meaning for "bibliography" developed in the last third of the century from the work of William Blades, Henry Bradshaw, and Robert Proctor on incunabula. Blades's The Life and Typography of William Caxton , published in 1861-63, attempted to classify and date Caxton's books on the basis of a close examination of their typography; according to T. B. Reed, writing in 1891, this book "marked a new epoch in bibliography, and disposed finally of the lax methods of the old school." 12 Blades himself had commented a few years earlier on the achievement of Bradshaw, whose important classified indexes of incunabula began with his work on the de Meyer collection in 1869: From an early period he perceived that to understand and master the internal evidences contained in every old book, the special peculiarities of their workmanship must be studied and classified, much in the same way as a botanist treats plants, or an entomologist insects. This he called "the natural-history system." . . . To make his work more effectual and scientific, he did that which many a bibliographer has to his great loss omitted to do—he made acquaintance with the technicalities of book-making. 13 In remarks of this kind, both "bibliography" and "science" are obviously used in a different sense from the way in which Horne or Guild had understood them. "Bibliography" here means what we would now call "analytical bibliography," with the emphasis on physical evidence, and "science" refers not to systematic knowledge in general but to the examination of empirical data. The movement initiated by these men is what lies behind Henry Stevens's statement in 1877 that bibliography "is fast becoming an exact science, and not a whit too soon. It is high time to separate it from mere catalogue-making" 14 —a statement which was echoed in remarkably similar language by W. A. Copinger in his "Inaugural Address" before the newly formed Bibliographical Society fifteen years later. 15 However inexact the term "exact science" might be, it served the rhetorical purpose these writers had in mind: an effort to contrast the methodical inspection of evidence found in books with the dilettante interest in old books merely as antiquarian objects. It is important to note that the putative inexactness which the new "exact science" would replace did not lie in the pursuit of enumerative bibliography but rather in the casual attitude of book collectors who—like the "new" bibliographers themselves—regarded books as physical objects. Since Stevens and Copinger both made a point of saying that bibliography—in their sense—was distinct from "mere" cataloguing, they may have given the impression that cataloguing was inexact work and that analytical bibliography was the exact work that had developed from it. But such an interpretation is actually an illogical mixture of two concepts which lie behind their statements: first, that "bibliography" in the sense of listing or cataloguing is a separate activity from "bibliography" in the sense of attention to books as physical objects; and, second, that the "exact" pursuit of the second kind of bibliography (examination of physical evidence) is replacing the "inexact" (vague dilettante interest). The first concept concerns definition of the field of activity; the second concerns the degree of seriousness with which the field is pursued. When the definition of an activity shifts in the middle of a discussion of a particular attribute of that activity, only confusion can result, and this kind of confusion could be regarded as the motif running through the whole history of attempts to link the words "science" and "bibliography." It is no wonder that Olphar Hamst, as early as 1880, felt that the word "bibliography" had so many meanings as to be useless for "any scientific purpose." 16 One further point may be noted about these early descriptions of analytical bibliography: the use of the phrase "natural-history method," like that of "exact science," was meant to be suggestive, not precise. Obviously Blades knew that books, being man-made objects, could not be studied in exactly the same way as plants or insects, but there was no reason for him to make that point, since he was concerned only with a general analogy between two examples of the use of empirical observation, in order to contrast that method with one which did not involve systematic observation at all. In the years which followed, the Bibliographical Society and several younger bibliographical societies continued to advertise the "scientific" nature of physical bibliography. The title of Falconer Madan's "On Method in Bibliography," read before the Bibliographical Society in 1893, is characteristic of the concern of these groups that their field should be systematic. 17 Speaking before the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society in 1899, John Ferguson said that bibliography "has nothing to do, in the first instance at least, with the contents. They may be good, bad, or indifferent, but they do not concern the bibliographer. If one may so say, he is not a book-ethicist, but a book-ethnologist." 18 Ferguson's choice of ethnology as his scientific analogy skillfully suggests that bibliography has both an objectivity of method and a concern with the human; even more revealingly he called bibliography "the biography of books" (p. 9). He did not develop the point, but his recognition that physical bibliography is a form of history probably accounts for his unwillingness to label bibliography flatly as a science; it is, he said, "the science or the art, or both, of book description" (p. 3). Although he went on to concern himself principally with the enumeration of books, his few comments on physical bibliography constitute an intelligent revision of the scientific analogy. Another speaker (J. Christian Bay) before another bibliographical society (the Bibliographical Society of America) observed in 1905, "Bibliography, as taught and practiced in the circle to which I address myself, ranks now equal to, if not among, the exact sciences"—phraseology which makes plain the metaphorical nature of the statement. 19 And Victor H. Paltsits at about the same time compared bibliography to anatomy in its concern with analyzing the "component parts" of a book. 20 Both writers, however, went on to confuse the issue somewhat by making the inevitable contrast with "library routine" and the compilation of lists. The whole tendency of this period to glorify the "scientific" aspects of bibliography, in contrast to what went before, is well summed up in James Duff Brown's Manual of Practical Bibliography (1906): If once it is recognized that bibliography is really the index and guide to all past and existing knowledge, . . . then there will be some hope of the science being set in its proper place as a key to the knowledge stored, and too often hidden, in books. At present we cannot hope for this recognition. It has become crystallized in the public mind—if it ever considers the matter at all—as a dull, repulsive game for snuffy and cantankerous old men who spend most of their time buying books from ignorant booksellers at one twentieth part of their market value, in order to stow them away on musty bookshelves, there to accumulate a further value in the course of time. Book-hunting, indeed, has almost become synonymous with bibliography in the minds of a great many persons. But, luckily, a more advanced, more reasonable, and more scientific spirit is awakening, and many modern practical exponents of the new bibliography have completely repudiated the traditional view of the limits of the science. (pp. 19-20) Brown's chief interest is obviously in reference bibliography, but his contrast of the scientific present with the dilettante past 21 is characteristic of the viewpoint lying behind the insistence on science in analytical bibliography as well. By 1912 the tradition of comparing bibliography with science was well established, and W. W. Greg had given enough thought to the matter that he was ready to make what would be the first of an important series of statements on it. He recognized that a general analogy with science could be drawn, for bibliographers "are gradually evolving a rigorous method for the investigation and interpretation of fresh evidence." 22 But what distinguished his remarks from previous ones is that he turned the scientific analogy into a criticism, saying that bibliography was not yet a "satisfactory science": In a sense every science is descriptive. But in so far as a science is merely descriptive it is sterile. You may dissect and you may describe, but until your anatomy becomes comparative you will never arrive at the principle of evolution. You may name and classify the colours of your sweet peas and produce nothing but a florist's catalogue; it is only when you begin grouping them according to their genetic origin that you will arrive at Mendel's formula. (pp. 40-41) Like the writers before him, Greg contrasted enumerative and analytical approaches but, unlike them, did not feel that the analytical had developed far enough to provide cause for celebration; the scientific analogy, if it was useful at all, apparently could serve to stimulate bibliographers to greater activity. Still, Greg used the word "science" in his own definition, which at the same time gave currency to another element that would complicate the issue. His chief interest in analytical bibliography, in contrast to that of Blades or Bradshaw, was the effect which its discoveries might have on the establishment of texts, and he defined bibliography (he called it "critical bibliography") as "the science of the material transmission of literary texts" (p. 48). In effect, his definition tended to make analytical bibliography the servant of literary study; and, while he did not say that the editorial process—choosing among variant readings and correcting mistakes—was a science, his statement did use the word "science" and did mention "literary texts." He had entered a fertile ground for misunderstanding, and it is not surprising that debates about the scientific nature of editing would occur, especially after others began to pronounce similar definitions. Of course, one of the principal accomplishments of the Bibliographical Society in its early years—reflected in the emphasis of R. B. McKerrow's "Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors . . ." 23 —was to demonstrate the bearing of analytical bibliography on literary matters; and it is understandable that A. W. Pollard, as he surveyed in 1913 the Society's first twenty-one years, should have defined bibliography as dealing with "the material mediums . . . through which the thoughts of authors reach those who will take the trouble to gain a knowledge of them." 24 George Watson Cole followed in 1916 with another statement stressing textual transmission—the "perpetuation of thought . . . by means of the printing-press"—as the domain of bibliographical study. 25 And Falconer Madan, in his Presidential Address to the Bibliographical Society in 1920, saw bibliography as "the groundwork to which every literary researcher and writer will instinctively turn"; like Greg, but more elaborately, he had recourse to "science" in expressing the connection between bibliography and literary study: "It is not too much to say that our work bears, or ought to bear, the same sort of relation to literary subjects of research as mathematics bear to natural science." 26 By a curious shift, the natural-history analogy was now more indirect; bibliography was not compared to science directly but instead to mathematics, as a tool employed in the sciences, thus making bibliography a tool of literary study—a rather narrow view of both mathematics and bibliography. Whether this statement was intended as a summary of the current situation or as a recommendation for the future is not clear, but in any case its hint of some sort of exactness in bibliographical work is unusually vague. This tendency to increase the distance between analytical bibliography and science was furthered in Pollard's Presidential Address to the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society in 1923. Entitled "The Human Factor in Bibliography," it pointed out that, unlike botany and geology, bibliography deals with human productions, and any analogy between bibliography and science was therefore somewhat limited. 27 Pollard expressed a point of view which has been heard often since then, but one cannot help feeling that its target is a nonexistent argument, since surely no one who had called bibliography scientific had believed that its materials of study were of precisely the same order as those in the physical sciences. It was bibliographers like Greg and Pollard, interested in the literary application of analytical bibliography, who were finding increasing reason to suggest qualifications of the scientific analogy; but ironically their association of bibliography and literature helped give rise to the misconception that bibliographers were attempting to put literary criticism on a scientific footing. 28 During the 1930s two bibliographers in particular—Greg and McKerrow—made comments about science which go to the heart of the matter. In each case they attempted to rectify certain fallacies which they believed the comparison with science had led to, and one begins to feel that they found the analogy more distracting than helpful. Greg, in his Presidential Address of 1930, recognized that bibliography is essentially a historical study; whether or not it is scientific thus turns into the question of whether historiography is a science, and Greg answered in the affirmative: "The knowledge of human events, and the methods by which that knowledge is pursued, have just as good a claim to be called a science as have any other body of facts and any other instruments of research." 29 Whereas he had believed earlier that bibliography was an immature science, he thought that it had now moved to a new stage, and he pointed out the meaninglessness of the often-used phrase "exact science": Is not exactitude the aim of every science, which it approaches as it gains in mastery over its material? . . . I think that the real distinction is not between an exact science and any other, but between a mature science and one that is still groping after its foundations, or else merely between science and bunkum. (p. 256) Although Greg was still calling bibliography a science, the implications were now different, since it had been equated with history. And as history it was an independent discipline, not "the slave of other sciences" (p. 259). 30 If from the beginning analytical bibliography's subject had been described as (in Greg's words) "human events"—as opposed to "natural events"—there would perhaps have been less misunderstanding about it. By the end of the decade McKerrow seemed even more exasperated with the scientific analogy. In his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939) he observed that the popular reputation of "science" caused people to wish "to bring within its scope, at least in name, many subjects which cannot properly be said to belong there" (p. vi). He admitted that science could be defined so as to include bibliography: "Truth is truth and logic is logic . . . and in a sense any honestly conducted enquiry may be termed scientific." But science as "usually understood," he asserted, involves demonstration by controlled experiment; in this sense the "textual critic" 31 cannot be scientific: . . . for scientific proof of his theories he must substitute arguments based on what seems to him, from his "knowledge of human nature" and from what he can learn of the procedure and habits of early copyists, printers, and theatrical producers, most likely to have occurred, and which can seldom or never be more than probably correct, even though the probability may in some cases be of a high degree. (p. vii) Taken together, these statements of Greg and McKerrow cover the crucial points: analytical bibliography is a form of historical investigation; its conclusions are on a lower plane of probability than the inductive generalizations of many sciences because of the impossibility in bibliography of repeating past events as experiments; it can be thought of as scientific only if "science" is taken in an extremely general sense. One wonders what more needed to be said on the subject. The scientific analogy, however, having become established, continued to turn up. G. F. Barwick, sketching the history of the formation of the main bibliographical societies, used "scientific bibliography" to mean the examination of a book "as an entity" (as opposed to list-making) and commented on various societies in terms of their attention to "scientific bibliography." 32 Arundell Esdaile considered bibliography to consist both of enumeration and analysis, the first of these being an "art" and the second a "science." 33 And Stephen Gaselee, agreeing that both are legitimate aspects of bibliography, went farther than previous writers in finding that both could be called scientific in the same sense—"both are a part of science, at any rate of that natural science to which bibliography is ordinarily and reasonably compared." 34 In addition to comments of this kind, there was one event in the 1930s which gave new force to the scientific analogy: the publication of John Carter and Graham Pollard's An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (1934). A spectacular instance of answering a bibliographical question by recourse to the laboratory was bound to become a classic illustration of "scientific bibliography." Yet no one would be likely to argue that the laboratory analysis of paper is a peculiarly bibliographical technique; it would be more accurate to say that it is a technique from a field other than bibliography which proved to be helpful in investigating a bibliographical problem. Microscopic analysis fits the popular conception of "science," but bibliography does not achieve scientific status merely through association with it. The way in which the Enquiry could legitimately be said to represent a "scientific" approach to bibliography is in the frame of mind of its authors, whose objectivity in assessing physical evidence led them to see the necessity for turning to another discipline for assistance. 35 A carefully worded statement on the dust-jacket of their book clearly reflects this distinction, saying that the book "introduces scientific methods which have never before been applied to bibliographical problems of this period." But probably most people, when they call Carter and Pollard's work "scientific bibliography," are thinking of the microscope and do not reflect on the fact that they are thereby attaching an additional meaning to an already overburdened term. Bibliography continued to be referred to as vaguely "scientific" through the 1940s, 36 though two important essays did appear—Madeleine Doran's "An Evaluation of Evidence in Shakespearean Textual Criticism" and R. C. Bald's "Evidence and Inference in Bibliography," both in the English Institute Annual of 1941. These essays constitute the most serious and extended treatment that had appeared of the implications of the scientific analogy, following the lines of Greg's and McKerrow's comments; more than that, they provided a direct examination of the nature of bibliographical reasoning and demonstration. Bald, agreeing with Greg, classified bibliography as history —or, more precisely, said that it belongs among those "organized human activities . . . loosely known as 'history and the social sciences'" (p. 162). Just as history studies "monuments" (material objects which survive) and "documents" (accounts of events, liable to human error), so bibliography, he reasoned, examines both books themselves, as physical objects, and external evidence bearing on their production and distribution. Because historical study involves human actions and because laboratory experiments cannot recreate the past, the method of "proving" a case in bibliography could be likened more appropriately to that followed in a court of law than to that employed in a scientific investigation. 37 "Bibliography," he summarized, "cannot claim for its conclusions the same universal validity as belongs to those of the exact sciences" (p. 162). Miss Doran, in her essay, provided a concise expression of this point of view: It should be clear that we are in a realm where demonstration, in the strict sense of the term, is impossible. For our method cannot be solely deductive; nor do our problems admit of controlled laboratory experiment. . . . The textual problem is always a historical one—an attempt at recovery of what actually did happen; demonstration, therefore, is always a matter of the establishment of probability. This is so great in some cases as to amount almost to certainty; in others, so slight as to be questionable. 38 (pp. 98-99) It would be hard to find a more compact and penetrating statement of the case. Four years later the Bibliographical Society's commemorative volume, Studies in Retrospect , 1892-1942 (1945), naturally gave some attention to the development of bibliography as a "scientific" pursuit, 39 but it included no comment which brings together all the central issues as this one does. From this point forward the most prolific commentator on bibliographical theory has been Fredson Bowers, and his writings, as one would expect, repeatedly touch on the "scientific" question. 40 However, he uses the word "science" infrequently, and it is clear that he follows in the line of those writers who find the scientific analogy somewhat facile. His position, as set forth in "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," 41 is that, although there has often been an "inferential identification of bibliography with textual criticism," the two are separate, and analytical bibliography can be pursued independently of any possible application to textual matters. Since analytical bibliography deals with physical evidence, it lends itself to logical, systematic procedures; "strictly bibliographical evidence," Bowers says, "crosses the line of probability into something close to the field which in science would be regarded as controlled experiment capable of being reproduced" (p. 58). 42 Textual criticism and editing, on the other hand, require cirtical insight: "the great emendations have been inspired art and not systematic science" (p. 45); 43 evidence in this area "can seldom if ever afford more than a high degree of probability, and this is essentially different from positive demonstration" (p. 57). Bowers makes clear, both here and in succeeding essays, a point which some of the later writers on "science" in bibliography do not seem to recognize—that analytical bibliography, while it may at times invalidate a literary argument through a factual demonstration, cannot (and does not claim to) eliminate the need for judgment and critical acumen in editing. Indeed, Bowers repeatedly defends the authority of informed critical insight, when coupled with an understanding of the extent to which analytical bibliography can contribute to the solution of a given problem: The scientific method should have its valued place in humane studies, but as a servant, not the master. The current exaltation of the scientist in other fields should not lead to his domination of the humanities. Yet the processes of logical and material demonstration which the more scientific bibliographical methods bring to literary studies cannot be idly surveyed from an ivory tower or they will eat away its foundations and topple it. 44 In a concise statement of the point he says, "Bibliography endeavors to take as much guesswork as possible out of textual criticism, and the literary method endeavors to inform bibliography with value judgments as a check on mechanical probability." 45 Although Bowers does occasionally apply the word "scientific" to analytical bibliography, 46 therefore, he is careful not to use it to describe editing; and he has done more than any other bibliographer to give substance to the word, by examining at length—in his 1959 Lyell Lectures 47 —the nature of the evidence which analytical bibliography produces and the soundness of the conclusions drawn from that evidence. We shall have occasion shortly to return to those lectures. But, first, it is worth noting that the use of the word "science" in connection with analytical bibliography—as a brief historical sketch of this kind reveals—has developed in two phases. First came the enthusiastic phase, in which bibliographers found science a useful analogy to help them advertise the fact that their field was a serious and systematic study, not a dilettante pursuit. Exaggeration was probably inevitable; 48 but however strongly they claimed bibliography to be science, these bibliographers generally did not examine in detail the implications of such a comparison but instead used it in a vaguer way for its suggestive value. 49 The second—or critical—phase began when bibliographers, taking these scientific claims more literally, recognized that a comparison of bibliography with "science" (that is, in the usual sense of "physical science") involved pointing out many differences, perhaps as many differences as similarities. Leading bibliographers of the past fifty or sixty years have taken this second position and have stated over and over various distinctions between bibliography and "science." At the same time, through both phases, the issue has been complicated by shifting terms, with one person talking about a different kind of "bibliography" from another, or using "science" in a different sense. One begins to wonder whether the whole matter was not a red herring from the start. Presumably the point of the analogy is to define bibliography, and definition by analogy can sometimes be illuminating, even when the supposed analogy serves as something to be reacted against. But when the comparison involves a concept as complex as "science," it may do more to confuse than to clarify. Whether bibliography can be defined as a "science" or as something else is of less importance than understanding, in a direct way, what in fact it does, what its methods of procedure are, what its strengths and weaknesses may be. More direct discussions of such matters might have promoted greater understanding than that which has resulted from the perennial concern with the "scientific" quality of bibliography. The course of these "scientific" comments over the years is not an inspiring one and appears to be leading nowhere; the last word on the subject would seem to have been said, and said repeatedly. But apparently Bradshaw's concept of a "natural-history method"—and all that follows from it—is so intriguing to bibliographers that they cannot let go of the analogy, for it remains a matter of discussion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The recent essays on this subject continue the historical trend toward the criticism of the scientific analogy: they find fault, in one way or another, with the supposedly scientific pretensions of bibliography. Insofar as they touch on the nature of bibliographical evidence or the historical aspect of the field and fail to make distinctions between one kind of bibliography or one aspect of science and another, they repeat past history. In this sense the TLS is right in saying that they have "revived the old argument about the scientific nature of bibliography" (though apparently it was never dead). But in another sense they are pitched on a different level, for they offer extended discourses on the philosophic background, the methodology, and the logic of bibliographical demonstration. It does not matter if, for purposes of argument, they assume greater claims for the scientific rigor of bibliography than have normally been advanced; but they do little to alter one's feeling that the question of science in bibliography, initiated as a metaphor to help elucidate the nature of the subject, has developed into a verbal smog which threatens to hide it. McKenzie's "Printers of the Mind"—the starting point for the current debate—is essentially a statement of the weaknesses of the inductive method. 50 Many of the conclusions reached through analytical bibliography, McKenzie shows, are unsound or less certain than they were thought to be, because in each case a generalization was based on an insufficient body of inductive evidence. The question which obviously follows is whether any body of inductive evidence can ever be large enough to support more than a reasonable guess. Although McKenzie is ostensibly criticizing bibliography for not being sufficiently "scientific," his discussion demonstrates that bibliography is like "science" in proceeding by empirical observation and that the problem of induction is therefore basic to both. Philosophers have never proposed a satisfactory solution to the problem of induction. Indeed, in the form in which it is often posed, there can be no solution: for if induction is by definition not a form of deduction, and if valid conclusions can result only from a deductive argument, then induction must be ruled out as a legitimate process of logical demonstration. McKenzie's way of dealing with this dilemma is a standard one: to advocate the insertion of qualifications in any inductive generalization and thus the conversion of such generalizations into hypotheses to be tested deductively. In his words, "A franker acceptance of deductive procedures would bring a healthy critical spirit into the subject by insisting on the rigorous testing of hypotheses, and the prime method of falsification—adducing contrary particulars—would impose a sound curb on premature generalizations" (p. 61). This line of reasoning—given its classic statement in Karl Popper's The Logic of Scientific Discovery (trans. 1959)—rejects inductive generalizations in favor of unfalsified hypotheses; but it does not confront squarely the logical objection to inductive evidence, since any finite body of evidence which fails to provide falsification for a hypothesis would be open to the same kind of objection. There would seem to be little difference between a generalization held provisionally to be true on the basis of examined evidence and a hypothesis for which no falsifying evidence has yet been located. In either case, further investigation may overturn present judgments. This sort of argument, in other words, appears to make little distinction between induction and deduction, except for the supposed greater caution of the latter. But if the goal of observation is to find some kind of regularity that will be useful in making further observations, excessive qualification may almost negate the process. As Max Black says, "In converting a purportedly inductive argument into a valid deductive one, the very point of the original argument— that is, to risk a prediction concerning the yet unknown—seems to be destroyed." 51 One could perhaps restate McKenzie's observation, without recourse to induction or deduction, simply by saying that bibliographers should be more careful in framing general statements and more thorough in surveying the relevant evidence. Clearly this is sound advice, and the most impressive part of McKenzie's essay is his effective account of instances in which bibliographers have jumped to conclusions that must be modified in the light of further evidence. McKenzie's article is important and timely: his work on the Cambridge University Press records has put him in a position to understand the value of knowing in detail the various jobs in progress in a printing shop at any one time, and one of the weaknesses of much bibliographical analysis in the past has been that the production of a single book was looked at in isolation, without sufficient regard for the total activity of a shop. The great value of McKenzie's essay, in other words, seems to me to lie in its challenge to widely held generalizations rather than in its theoretical discussions about the logic of bibliographical investigation. Nevertheless, the objections to induction which McKenzie summarizes ought to be faced by bibliographers—anyone whose work involves argument from empirical observation should give some thought to the logical validity of what he is doing. The inconclusiveness of inductive reasoning cannot be denied, but it seems shortsighted to limit "scientific" argument to the deductive. Philosophers of science recognize that there is no such thing as "the" scientific method, except perhaps in the broadest characteristics. 52 One can say that "science" or "scientific method" involves scrupulous fidelity to evidence obtained empirically and a systematic means of handling that evidence. But the details of the procedure will vary from one kind of situation to another or from one area of endeavor to another. Inductive investigations can be "scientific" in this sense, and to deny their legitimacy is greatly to restrict the range of research. In justifying induction one must finally turn to the pragmatic or common-sense argument of common experience. Everyone, from birth, learns to get along through an inductive process. From time to time one's generalizations are proved incorrect, when the expected does not occur, and one makes adjustments in the generalizations; but the whole concept of "rationality" or "rational behavior" depends on expectations of regularity based on past experience. Perhaps there is no ultimate regularity in the universe; the point, however, is that the projection into the future of a seeming regularity from the past appears to be the only way of proceeding in the short run. If induction is denied, all human concepts would seem to be destroyed with it. 53 Furthermore, a deductive argument is conclusive only in terms of its premises, which may themselves be unrelated to the "real" world (that is to say, logical validity and truth are separate concepts). Therefore, to establish "truth"—that contact with the "real" or "objective" which is the aim of research—involves the testing of those premises by what amounts to an inductive procedure, even if it is expressed in terms of Popper's theory of falsification. In other words, one is driven to induction on pragmatic grounds, despite the unassailability of logical objections to it. I am making this amateurish summary of a familiar philosophical debate in order to suggest two points: first, bibliographers—though they should understand the implications of inductive reasoning—need not hesitate to proceed inductively, so long as they do so with care and responsibility; second, to collect and examine evidence with care and responsibility is by definition to be scientific, and discussions about whether or not bibliography resembles one particular scientific pursuit or another seem somewhat fruitless exercises (except perhaps to demonstrate the multiplicity of individual paths which scientific endeavor takes). The more direct and positive approach to scientific method in bibliography is to accept induction openly and to set about examining what constitutes responsible handling of inductive evidence in this particular field, given the nature of the problems which bibliographers wish to solve. Fredson Bowers did exactly that fifteen years ago in his Lyell Lectures. After distinguishing analytical bibliography (concerned with books as "tangible objects") from textual bibliography (in which analytical bibliography is applied to "internal form, or contents" of books) and suggesting in general the relations of bibliographical research to editing, Bowers examines the nature of bibliographical evidence and states that one of the "laws" of bibliographical procedure "requires us to reason inductively from specific, concrete evidence in the text" rather than deductively from "our general ideas about printing practice" (p. 36). Of course, if "our general ideas" were adequately buttressed with evidence, there would be no problem, but finding that evidence returns us to an inductive search—thus the inductive process is basic, whatever it is called, and Bowers is not interested in debating the terminology. 54 Instead, he proceeds to—what is the heart of the matter—the question of the interpretation of inductive evidence, and he sets up "three orders of certainty": the demonstrable, the probable, and the possible. Now to say that inductive evidence can ever lead to a "demonstrable" case (one in which physical evidence "leaves no loophole for opinion") entails certain assumptions —that all relevant evidence is known and has been examined 55 or that extreme coincidences do not in fact take place. In other words, one has to begin with some notion of the range of occurrences which it is reasonable to expect. Bowers calls this notion the "postulate of normality," which "depends on the working hypothesis that all we know at any given time must be the truth, and therefore the details of the printing process and their handling that have been recovered (when tolerably full) must represent 'normality' unless we have stubbornly inexplicable evidence to the contrary" (p. 72). The phrase "when tolerably full" underscores the central problem, since one must have surveyed a certain quantity of evidence in order to interpret a new piece of evidence, and yet without that new evidence itself the interpretation may be faulty. Nevertheless, some assumption of normality is unavoidable: This hypothesis is necessary in some part because a confirmation of the validity of inductive bibliographical reasoning is that it leads us, by a series of tests of the evidence, to an explanation consistent with our knowledge of normality. (A different matter, incidentally, from deducing an explanation of evidence from this knowledge of normality.) Also, since certainty about every small detail in the operation is difficult to attain, it is essential whenever we can to assume that we know the general process of printing, for otherwise conjecture from evidence would be paralysed for lack of some standard for confirmation, or would have no bounds set to mere guesswork. (p. 72) At this point McKenzie would say that we do not have a large enough body of evidence to define satisfactorily any kind of "normality." 56 Still, his description of a deductive process based on a recognition of "the partial and theoretic nature of bibliographical knowledge" is not, in practical terms, very different from Bowers's picture of an inductive procedure in which explanations "based on imperfect evidence" are modified or corrected by new evidence. Obviously we never know enough; but if we are to proceed, we have to assume that we know enough to get on with. Bowers's discussion, by providing numerous examples of what he regards as demonstrable, probable, and possible interpretations of bibliographical evidence, shifts the focus from the theoretical to the practical. He is not principally concerned with arguing the philosophical question of inductive versus deductive reasoning; the assumption lying behind his analysis seems to be that, since the demonstration of a "truth" finally rests on empirical observation, one might as well accept induction and proceed to confront and examine the evidence that turns up. As a result, his book is a more direct investigation of the "scientific" nature of bibliography than any other discussion, for, instead of concentrating on how well bibliography conforms to certain abstract qualities of "science," he looks at concrete examples of what bibliography in fact consists of, in order to see what particular brand of "scientific method" emerges as most appropriate for dealing with bibliographical evidence. In the same year in which McKenzie's essay was published, James Thorpe delivered a paper entitled "The Ideal of Textual Criticism" at a Clark Library Seminar. 57 One section of this paper collects quotations from several bibliographers—especially Greg and Bowers—which seem to assert the scientific nature of "textual criticism," and it cites a few instances of quantitative and mechanized approaches to textual problems. Thorpe then proceeds to conclude, "I can see nothing in the present or future of textual criticism, however it is carried on, which will make it answerable to the term 'science' or 'scientific'" (p. 68). Of course, if "science" is taken to mean "the physical sciences," it is easy to agree with him; but, since no analysis of the term or of the nature of textual criticism accompanies the statement, it has the effect of being simply an assertion, placed in opposition to a series of other assertions. The scientific analogy is worth analyzing if some illumination of the nature of the subject emerges, but little is gained by asserting its inadequacy or inappropriateness, particularly since leading bibliographers over the years have repeatedly made the same point. Although the bibliographers cited by Thorpe did make the comments he quotes, I hope that my earlier historical survey has shown the general drift of the major statements of the last half-century to be in the direction of finding fault with the scientific analogy and recognizing the important place which critical judgment occupies. The difficulty here—as in so many similar discussions in the past—is one of definition. Does "science" mean the same thing throughout all of Thorpe's quotations and in his own remarks as well? More to the point, does "bibliography" mean the same thing, and the same thing as "textual criticism"? Although Thorpe elsewhere discusses at length the relation of bibliography and textual criticism, 58 he does not at this point raise the issue of shifting definitions. His subject is specifically "textual criticism," yet the word "bibliography" is what apears in a number of his quotations; and it should be clear by now that the two terms have not normally been regarded as synonymous. (Even when "text" or "textual criticsm" appears, it is by no means certain that the writer is asserting the "scientific" nature of every step of the editorial process.) The trend in recent decades, as shown above, is to think of the techniques of analytical bibliography (analysis of physical evidence) as perhaps having certain "scientific" qualities but to regard textual criticism (often defined to include editing) as being—true to its name— critical . Thorpe may be concerned about the increasing amount of attention which an editor is expected to give to bibliographical information, but that is a different matter from suggesting that the editorial process itself is claimed to be mechanical (which is what "scientific" often means in this context). If Thorpe's conclusion is that editing involves critical judgment (or literary criticism), most people would undoubtedly agree, including those from whom he quotes. One can concur, in other words, with what Thorpe appears to be saying at the end and yet not see how he is led to that statement by quoting comments on "scientific" bibliography and textual criticism from various periods—especially without analyzing the sense in which each writer was using the key terms. A similar problem emerges in Peter Davison's incisive discussion 59 of McKenzie's position, for Davison is chiefly interested in textual criticism, while McKenzie is concerned with analytical bibliography. In what is surely one of the most penetrating analyses of the nature of bibliography yet written, Davison argues persuasively that McKenzie's view of scientific method is oversimplified and that his view of bibliography as amenable to the "hypothetico-deductive method" is unrealistic. Nevertheless, Davison's examples are editorial problems, and he shows the shortcomings of the deductive method in terms of editing. He points out, for example, that editors "have to provide answers even if evidence is insufficient or contradictory" (p. 13); and he goes on to explain that the deductive method cannot be more than a useful tool which may help us avoid the avoidable. Thus, in practice, one often has to choose between various courses, none wholly satisfactory, and the hypothetico-deductive method is a convenient means of testing the choices open to an editor, helping him to decide to which choice he should give preference. (pp. 13-14) All this seems reasonable, but it does not meet McKenzie on his own grounds, since McKenzie is talking about analytical bibliography. What starts out as a criticism of McKenzie's position—the advocacy of the deductive method for a particular purpose—turns into a criticism of the appropriateness of the deductive method for a different purpose. I do not believe that McKenzie would disagree with Davison's position in regard to editing: that an editor must frequently make decisions on the basis of his own interpretation and judgment (informed by whatever data are available) rather than on the basis of conclusively established facts. But McKenzie would still say that the deductive method should be followed in bibliographical analysis—in establishing, that is, the facts and hypotheses which may turn out to be of use in the process of editing. It is possible to meet this argument—as I tried to show earlier—by examining the general problem of induction; but Davison, though he makes an effective case against deduction, does not really speak directly to McKenzie's point, since he shifts the area of application to textual criticism. Once again, a debate about the scientific aspects of bibliography is rendered less clear than it might be through the failure to draw distinctions among different kinds of bibliography (or between "bibliography" and "textual criticism"). Davison's important essay takes up a still larger issue. The existence of essays like McKenzie's and Thorpe's, he believes, may suggest that bibliography is at a "moment of crisis," that it is engaged in what Thomas S. Kuhn calls "paradigm rejection" 60 —the replacing of one paradigm by another when the former is judged to be inadequate to handle the problems with which it is faced. He cites examples of dissatisfaction with the usual concepts of "author" and "text" and with the stemmatic approach to textual criticism. He then argues—in the most intriguing part of his discussion—that, just as a creative writer reflects the changing world-views that result from new scientific theories, so an editor (who responds to "the needs, general and scholarly, of his own society") should perhaps "take note of these changes in the physical explanation of our world and the response of creative writers thereto" (p. 27). The rise of the "new bibliography" is placed in this context: It was the new awareness of science and man which developed in the nineteenth century (and which can be seen in the great creative writers as well as the scientists of the time) which came to be applied to textual studies in English literature from the time McKerrow and Greg met at Cambridge in the 1890s. (p. 26) One illustration is the study of the history of textual transmission: The response to the spirit motivating the understanding of man in society which influences the creative writing of, say, a Zola or a Shaw, or even a Lawrence or a Joyce, influences also that aspect of textual studies which seeks to discover what happened to texts in the societies which produced and transmitted them. (p. 26) Insofar as this argument says that a man inevitably reflects the characteristic interests and approaches of his intellectual milieu, it is making a generalization about all men and not about bibliographers in particular. But in applying this observation to bibliographers, it has the merit of stressing the humanistic aspects of the field, of saying that bibliographers are like "creative writers," historians, and others who meditate on human behavior, in their reaction to scientific theories about the physical universe. By proposing a pervasive influence of science on bibliography, Davison is paradoxically setting the two apart, for he associates that influence not with specific methodological changes but with an altered outlook that bibliographers share with other thinking human beings. The result is to provide a strong affirmation of the creative in bibliography and to reject the idea that bibliography is like "science" (although the rejection is on a deeper level than is usually implied by the comparison). The affirmation is salutary, and it gains weight from the thoughtful analysis lying behind it. But one is surprised to find the conclusion couched in language which seems to reopen the troublesome issue of "scientific bibliography." Davison is urging bibliographers to a renewed faith in intuition and subjective judgment: What we could find is that the more precise techniques developed by "the school of Bowers and Hinman" (if I may use such an expression) are to us not unlike what Newtonian physics is to scientists, but that outside the usefulness of these methods (which are, after all, rather extensive) we ought not to be afraid of irrationality and infinite coincidence. Or, to put it more conventionally, imagination and taste. (pp. 27-28) Here is the most sophisticated use yet made of the scientific analogy. But to claim that the recognition and acceptance of creativity in bibliography somehow involve modification of the bibliographical paradigm is to suggest that bibliography has been more rigidly mechanical than would appear to be the case, judging from the statements, and the work, of its practitioners. Even in the limited area of analytical bibliography—or in Newtonian physics—imagination plays its role (in recognizing significant evidence, in devising ways of arranging it, in making connections between related occurrences). Furthermore, if the bibliographical methods springing from McKerrow and Greg are regarded as the reflection, in the bibliographical area, of the nineteenth-century scientific revolution, it is hard to see the aptness of comparing a further development of those methods with Newtonian science. In any case, the emergence of ways of looking at the universe which go beyond Newtonian physics can indeed be said to require modification of a paradigm, since the Newtonian laws were thought to be universal; but the rules of procedure in analytical bibliography were never claimed to have the same kind of universal application throughout the whole realm of bibliographical pursuits. (Newtonian laws might be thought of as operating in all areas of one horizontal plane—which serves well enough to provide a perspective for everyday purposes—though we recognize the existence of other planes; in contrast, rules of analytical bibliography might be thought of as operating in the limited areas of several planes forming one vertical segment of the bibliographical whole, though we recognize that other segments—editing, for example—border on it.) Besides, to compare "Newtonian physics" and the "precise techniques" of analytical bibliography is seemingly to mix explanations with approaches, though both are called "methods." If the methods of the two areas are compared, it is true that both require care and accuracy, but so do all scholarly pursuits; if the discoveries of the two are compared, both share the ultimate inconclusiveness of all inductive generalizations, though one offers in support an incalculably greater body of evidence than the other. That bibliography and science can be compared in certain carefully defined respects and contrasted in others is not at issue. But Davison's closing comparison, like so many similar ones in the past, diverts attention from, rather than clarifies, his main point and therefore does less than justice to what he has to say. Another essay which stresses the humanistic nature of bibliography appeared at about the same time as Davison's. Morse Peckham, in "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," is chiefly concerned with examining the concepts of "text" and "author," 61 but he begins by questioning the appropriateness of the words "mechanical" and "scientific" as descriptive of bibliography. To think of book production as a mechanical process in which the "human factor" must be adduced to explain anomalies is, he says, an inversion of the truth, since book production is essentially a form of human behavior, and its study is therefore a branch of historiography: What the analytical bibliographer does, then, whether he realizes it or not, is, on the basis of certain artifacts which are the consequence or deposit of various behaviors, to make a theoretical reconstruction or construct of the behaviors responsible for the historical emergence of those artifacts. This is so obvious that it would scarcely need saying were it not for the constant appearance of the term "human factor" in both the theoretical and problem-directed discourse of analytical bibliography. The "human factor" is not something that occasionally enters into the bibliographer's thinking when he finds himself in a spot; it is almost exclusively all that he is concerned with. The analytical bibliographer is a historian, and he should not forget it for a moment. The object of his inquiry is not printed artifacts as physical objects but human behavior in the past, human behavior that no longer exists and cannot now be examined. (p. 131) That bibliography is a historical study has been expressed before, by Greg and others, in less elaborate language, and Peckham is right in saying that it does not need to be repeated—except in the hope that one more repetition may convert those who apparently do not yet understand. But are there really any bibliographers who do not understand that they are dealing with human productions and human behavior? It seems unlikely, and yet the kind of terminology Peckham objects to undoubtedly persists. The problem, of course, is one of rhetoric. The old scientific analogy has become so entrenched as a cliché that it continually turns up in one form or another. While its history shows that it is productive of enough confusion that it might better be avoided, it obviously still serves a purpose for some writers. I do not believe that most bibliographers who use the term "human factor" would disagree with Peckham's statement that the term "actually explains nothing" and "only admits that the explanation has broken down." One impulse to use the scientific analogy comes from the need to explain just what approach the analytical bibliographer is taking toward human behavior; since he is dealing with an area which involves the use of mechanical instruments—pens, presses, type-formes, type matrices, paper moulds, and so on—his approach is to see how much can be explained by factoring out the "human" element and concentrating on those instruments. Obviously what he is trying to describe ultimately is a human action, but he wants to see how far he can go in that direction by examining the products of mechanical instruments. He can never go all the way, and sometimes he can hardly get started; when he resorts to a term like "human factor," he is admitting that his explanation can go no farther. Certainly the suggestion that his work is a "scientific" treatment of "mechanical" operations is an overstatement and a cliché, but the motivation for it is clear enough. The difficulty comes—as it has repeatedly—when people react to the rhetoric on a different level from the one intended, and Peckham's complaint about "human factor" is another instance. Nevertheless, he usefully redirects our attention to the basically historical nature of bibliography and recognizes where that leaves the scientific question: "The scientific status of analytical bibliography is the scientific status of any historiographical construct" (p. 132). This, too, has of course been said before, but what Peckham adds that is new is his approach to the definition of historiography. Since statements about past events cannot be verified by empirical observation, he argues, their interior logic has no relation to any "truth" outside the historical account unless the historian, like the scientist, makes predictions about currently existing artifacts, which are thus subject to repeated direct observation. As he puts it in another essay, historical statements "cannot tell us how to locate the phenomenally perceptible, but only how to construct other statements that may, or may not, successfully instruct us how to locate something in the world before us." 62 In other words, the historian "predicts about where he is going to find documents and artifacts and what their attributes are going to be" (p. 133); and "like any scientist," Peckham says, the historian, after checking his prediction, may have to adjust the thinking that led to it. The question whether history is a science has been more widely debated than the question of bibliography's scientific status, 63 and what Peckham has done is to offer another explanation of the sense in which history does resemble science. His argument, though expressed in different terms, arrives at essentially the same point as McKenzie's: that analytical bibliography—or history—is scientific insofar as it continually tests hypotheses against directly observable evidence, insofar as the "printers of the mind" move outside the mind. 64 In contrast to the natural sciences, however, with the large body of evidence which they have amassed, "analytical bibliography certainly is not a very highly developed science" (p. 134) 65 —a point which Greg made long ago. Peckham's analysis does not reach any new conclusions, but it goes farther than previous discussions in treating the relations of bibliography and science in the context of historiography. The recognition that analytical bibliography is history should answer any questions about whether it is an independent pursuit or only the servant—"handmaid" is the favorite term 66 —of another pursuit. But the question has generated a considerable amount of heat, and recourse to the analogy of "pure" versus "applied" science has not helped to answer it. 67 When Copinger, and Greg after him, called bibliography the grammar of literary investigation, 68 they did not mean to imply that the grammar was of no interest in its own right. But the fact that analytical bibliography grew up in the hands of people who were concerned with literary texts led a number of literary scholars to believe that it existed only as an aid for establishing texts. 69 As a result of this way of thinking, Bowers found himself in the position of insisting on the seemingly self-evident: that bibliography is "an independent discipline of scholarship and not merely an ancillary technique to literary investigation." 70 The possibility of understanding the word "bibliography" in various ways is again at the root of the matter, as it is when Thorpe returns to this issue. He quotes S. L. M. Barlow as saying, "It is none of the business of the bibliographer or the pure scientist what use is made of his findings"; 71 and he objects by replying, "In my way of looking at textual criticism, its value derives only from serving the useful purpose of helping to present the text which the author intended" (p. 68). But "bibliographer" does not necessarily mean "textual critic"; it can mean "analytical bibliographer," whose field of interest—the printing practices of a given period or a given shop as revealed by physical evidence—is surely a legitimate subject of inquiry in its own right. If it had been as popular to call bibliography "history" as it has been to call it "science," these matters would probably have aroused less controversy; and Peckham's emphasis on the historical nature of analytical bibliography is therefore welcome. Forty years ago Georg Schneider, in his book on reference bibliography, said, "It makes little difference whether bibliography is termed a science or an art, a technique or a skill, or even all of these together." 72 One is particularly ready at this point to apply the statement to other areas of bibliography as well. The act of classifying a subject in terms of a larger framework ought to help clarify the nature of that subject, but the history of the association of bibliography with science shows that there are exceptions. Part of the trouble, it is evident, is that bibliography is not "a subject" but a related group of subjects that happen to be commonly referred to by the same term. There should be no problem in recognizing historical bibliography (the study of printing, publishing, and associated areas at particular times in the past) as history; nor is it hard to move from there to an understanding of analytical bibliography (the examination of the physical evidence in books as a clue to the processes of their production) as history. Descriptive bibliography again is history (the history of the forms in which a given group of books has appeared), drawing on both historical and analytical bibliography. It may have occasion, depending on the nature of the problems encountered and the level of detail contemplated, to utilize instruments or methods of measurement generally regarded as "scientific," 73 but that fact does not make it a "science," except in the general sense that it is striving for accuracy; it may often take as its field of investigation the books written by a particular literary figure, but that fact does not make it a "literary" study. Textual criticism and scholarly editing, 74 however, though they draw on these three historical kinds of bibliography and though they aim at establishing the history of particular texts, deal with questions of meaning in texts which can frequently be resolved only by literary sensitivity, and they can reasonably be thought of as part of the field of literary criticism 75 —but they could also be defined as a form of history, and to debate the matter would be as fruitless as to debate whether they are a form of science. To regard bibliography as principally historical is not to settle anything, since the status of history is also in question; 76 but it places the debate about the scientific nature of bibliography in the context of a larger debate, about which much more has already been written, and it associates bibliography with other pursuits that concentrate on unique past events, 77 thus providing a more immediately acceptable analogue (if indeed it is not a tautology). The impulse to use a scientific analogy is ultimately the natural human inclination to believe that what one is doing now is more rigorous and precise than what people were doing in the past. Speaking of textual criticism, Housman, in a well-known passage, says that "the most frivolous pretender has learnt to talk superciliously about 'the old unscientific days.'" But the truth is, he continues, "The old unscientific days are everlasting; they are here and now." 78 To talk about what one is doing can sometimes help one to proceed; but there are other times when it seems best to get on with the work and to define the work by doing it. 79</field>

A convenient collection of quotations of definitions of bibliography appears in Percy Freer's Bibliography and Modern Book Production (1954), pp. 1-13. 9 Even at this early stage, however, the word "science" in this context did not go without criticism. Macvey Napier, writing the first full article on "Bibliography" for the Encyclopaedia Britannica (in the Supplement of 1816), complained about Horne's remark: "He seems to have allowed himself to be imposed upon, by the vague verbiage of those French Writers, who claim for this branch of knowledge a character of vastness which does not belong to it." In another criticism of the French view, he says that "some of her Bibliographers have lately fallen into a very extravagant mode of describing the nature and rank of this branch of Learning. They go so far as to represent it as a Universal Science, in whose ample range all other sciences, and all other kinds of knowledge, are comprehended." 10 Library Journal , 1 (1876-77), 67-69. It is worth noting, however, that his inclusion among the bibliographer's concerns of "the materials of which books are composed" and the "external peculiarities or distinctions of an edition" foreshadows the later emphasis of physical bibliography. 11 He also referred to the development of "material" (or physical) bibliography as "due to the gradual formation of a technical science of books" and ended by saying that bibliographers should "recognise the chief value of their science as the handmaid of literature." Taylor's article followed the same plan as Napier's 1816 article but was largely rewritten. 12 "Memoir of the Late William Blades," in Blades, The Pentateuch of Printing (1891), p. xii. 13 Quoted (from the Printer's Register , 6 March 1886) in G.

McKerrow recognized, however, that editing requires more than analytical bibliography by itself can provide: "The knowledge and literary training of a scholar like Dyce could and often did enable him better to represent his author's intention, than more 'scientific' methods in the hands of men unskilled to use them" (p. 219). In another comment in the "Notes" he expressed both the relative objectivity of analytical bibliography and its historical nature: analytical bibliography is "one of the most absorbing of all forms of historical enquiry," he said, in part because "such discoveries as we may make are real discoveries, not mere matters of opinion, but provable things that no amount of after-investigation can shake" (p. 221). His optimism about the possibility of conclusive proof in analytical bibliography had not altered by the time he converted the "Notes" into An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), for this statement remains (p. 5). 24 "Our Twenty-First Birthday," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 13 (1913-15), 24. A few years earlier, in his article for the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1910), Pollard did not call bibliography the science but rather the "art of the examination, collation and description of books." Though he did not discuss the issue in Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909), one of the early monuments of the "new" bibliography, he did talk about establishing a "scientific hypothesis" to account for the 1619 quartos (p. 99). 25 "Bibliographical Problems, with a Few Solutions," PBSA , 10 (1916), 124. In this essay he also described bibliography as "the comparative anatomy of the book" (p. 127). Four years later in "Bibliography —A Forecast," Cole asserted that bibliography could be regarded as a science in the light of the Century Dictionary 's general definition of "science" and again likened it to anatomy in its minute examination of books "to discover the relations that each part bears to the whole" ( PBSA , 14 [1920], 10-11). 26 "Some Experiences of a Bibliographer," Library , 4th ser., 1 (1920-21), 139-40. 27 Publications of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , 12 (1921-25), 69-77. 28 One essay from the 1930s may be taken to show some of the problems that arise. Hereward T. Price, in "Towards a Scientific Method of Textual Criticism for the Elizabethan Drama," JEGP , 36 (1937), 151-67, complained about what he called the "bibliographical school" of editing because he found its adherents guilty of "hasty generalization on insufficient data"; yet one of his chief examples was Dover Wilson, whose work would not be regarded by most analytical bibliographers as illustrating the way their discipline operates. (His criticism, however, is understandable, since Wilson himself spoke of bibliography as forming "the only secure and scientific basis for textual investigations"—see, e.g., Library , 3rd ser., 9 [1918], 153.) Price concluded by urging greater scientific rigor for "textual criticism": "Scholars think too much of an explanation which may be true and not at all of an explanation which must be true. It rarely occurs to scholars that their business is not so much to find explanations for special cases, as to discover the explanation which fits all the cases of the same sort. This is a truism in the natural sciences; let us hope we can make it a truism in the science of textual criticism" (p. 167). It is not clear whether "textual criticism" here means the same as "analytical bibliography" or whether it includes editing as well; the statement would be more effective if it clearly distinguished between the two and recognized the possibility that different procedures might be appropriate to each. 29 "The Present Position of Bibliography," Library , 4th ser., 11 (1930-31), 258. 30 Greg apparently found it compatible to speak of bibliography as an independent subject and at the same time to define it in terms of literary study or as the "grammar of literary investigation." Of course, one of his reasons for stressing its independence was to oppose the notion of bibliography as a list-compiling service for other disciplines. In another address, a year and a half later, he emphatically stated that the "bibliography" he was talking about was "in no way particularly or primarily concerned with the enumeration or description of books—a belief which has done much in the past to reduce it to futility and retard the recognition of its real nature and importance." This kind of argument is merely an attempt to segregate analytical bibliography from what is regarded as "bibliography" in the popular mind; but he went on to explain once again that his kind of bibliography dealt with the "formal aspect," not the subject matter, of books, thus implicitly linking it with "exact" or "objective" studies. Indeed, he continued to define bibliography as "the science of the transmission of literary texts." See "Bibliography—An Apologia," Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932-33), 113-43. The same ideas also appeared in his address "The Function of Bibliography in Literary Criticism Illustrated in a Study of the Text of King Lear ," Neophilologus , 18 (1933), 241-62: he praised critical insight but felt that the critic should accept bibliographical facts not with antagonism but "with the welcome accorded by the true scientific spirit, the spirit of intellectual integrity" (p. 244). 31 By "textual critic" McKerrow really meant "analytical bibliographer," since his (and Greg's) conception of bibliography stressed its relation to texts. But the possibility of interpreting "textual critic" to mean something roughly equivalent to "editor" may distract some readers from the main point of the argument. The issue McKerrow is discussing is not the scientific nature of the editorial process but rather—what had been repeatedly claimed—the scientific nature of the processes of analysis which form a foundation for the editorial process. 32 "Bibliographical Societies and Bibliography," Library , 4th ser., 11 (1930-31), 151-59. 33 A Student's Manual of Bibliography (1931), p. 13. His discussion of analytical bibliography begins, "In all sciences laboratory work on the specimen precedes classification" (p. 18); under "Historical Bibliography" he speaks of "anatomy" and the "natural history method"—which he calls "Darwinism applied by analogy to a human activity" (pp. 20-21). 34 "The Aims of Bibliography," Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932-33), 228. Gaselee continued to use the analogy in describing Bradshaw's contribution as "a change of direction almost comparable to the work of Darwin or Mendel." 35 The same could be said of Allan Stevenson's use of beta-radiography for reproducing watermarks, as illustrated by The Problem of the "Missale speciale" (1967). Even if this technique becomes standard in bibliographical investigation of paper—as there is reason to believe it should—it is still a technique from outside the field of bibliography which has become useful in bibliographical work. 36 For example, Randolph G. Adams, in some "Remarks" before the Bibliographical Society of America in 1942, used the scientific analogy in recognizing the intrinsic interest of analytical bibliography, whether or not applied to a literary problem: "I often think of bibliography as akin to, or analogous to, pure science. The findings of pure scientists are not always applied in the lifetime of the discoverer" ( PBSA , 36 [1942], 59). In the same year Rollo Silver, reviewing G. L. McKay's directory of the New York book-trade to 1820, declared, "In approach and method, bibliography is one more science," and compared McKay's accomplishment to that of "a chemist listing the components of a single compound" ( PBSA , 36 [1942], 78-79). F. C. Francis, after surveying "Recent Bibliographical Work," concluded that it was characterized by the "careful amassing of all possible data before attempting to draw conclusions"; he had demonstrated, he believed, "that there is really scientific bibliographical work being done at the present time" ( Library , 4th ser., 23 [1942-43], 126). 37 A similar analogy was drawn by Henry Thomas, who maintained that "bibliography on its physical side is (or should be) at least as scientific as Scotland Yard" ("Watermarks," Edinburgh Bibliographical Society Transactions , 2 [1940-46], 450). This analogy has reappeared a number of times since then, as in Stevenson's The Problem of the "Missale speciale," p. 69. 38 Her use of the word "textual" here as a virtual synonym for "bibliographical" shows that she (like Greg) was thinking of analytical bibliography in terms of its application to textual matters. 39 Greg, in his essay "Bibliography—A Retrospect," noted the movement of bibliography "from the dilettante stage to the technical. And it was the work of the incunabulists," he continued, "and of those who followed their lead, that transformed bibliography from a study the main interest of which was artistic to one governed by the methods of scientific inquiry" (p. 27). Victor Scholderer said that the study of incunabula was put on "a truly scientific basis" (p. 32) during the early years of the Society and that Robert Proctor "found the history of early printing guesswork and left it a science" (p. 34). F. P. Wilson, in his remarkable chapter on "Shakespeare and the 'New Bibliography,'" wrote of Greg, "As do men of science, he has worked by analysis and synthesis" (p. 135). And Michael Sadleir referred to "the science of bibliography" (p. 146). 40 A glance at the writings of others during the 1950s and 1960s shows that the same variety of uses of the word "science" continues. Stanley Morison called bibliography "essentially the same discipline as Palaeography," which he defined, in turn, as a "science . . . pursued primarily for the benefit of the efficient criticism of the physical means of the transmission of thought" ("The Bibliography of Newspapers and the Writing of History," Library , 5th ser., 9 [1954], 154). James G. McManaway asserted, "Pure bibliographical research may be defended in the same terms as pure scientific research. In fact, Bibliography is sometimes referred to as a science. Certainly its methods are scientific, and its purposes" ("Bibliography," in Literature and Science [1955], p. 27). F. N. L. Poynter believed that bibliography "is neither an art nor a science but may contain both," though the analytical methods developed by Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg "may justly be called 'scientific'" ( Bibliography: Some Achievements and Prospects [1961], pp. 5, 6). Allan Stevenson considered bibliography "an art and a science, mixing the critical and creative with cool precision and method" (Hunt Library Catalogue , 2 [1961], cxlii) and later asked that watermarks be studied "as scientifically as we have studied types" ( The Problem of the "Missale speciale ," p. 69). William A. Jackson, on the other hand, avoided "science" in defining bibliography as "the art of looking at a book objectively, as a physical object" ( Bibliography and Literary Studies [1962], p. 1); and Charlton Hinman did not use the word in distinguishing analytical bibliography from editing: "Bibliographical analysis can establish many facts about the printing-house history of a book. . . . It can provide all manner of general enlightenment. . . . Yet the final resolution of particular textual problems is ordinarily an editorial responsibility" ( The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare [1963], 1: vii). 41 SB , 3 (1950-51), 37-62. An earlier remark on the "scientific" nature of descriptive bibliography occurs in Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949): "I do not see how one can escape the conviction that the 'scientific' is basic in true descriptive bibliography, and that no amount of other inquiry, no matter how valuable, can itself substitute for the analytical description of the book as a material object" (p. 34). But he adds that descriptive bibliographies need not be limited to "scientific description only": "I feel that strictly scientific bibliographers often unduly limit the more general value of their work to too few classes of readers." 42 He goes on to say that what this produces, rather than "high probability," is "practical demonstration on physical evidence of a mechanical nature, demonstrable by a mechanical process." Actually, of course, such "demonstration" is simply a higher level of probability, resulting from agreements within a body of inductive evidence which common sense tells one cannot be explained as mere coincidence. 43 Cf. his later comment, "I should prefer the taste and judgement of a Kittredge (wrong as he sometimes was), and of an Alexander, to the unskilled and therefore unscientific operation of a scientific method as if it were the whole answer" —in Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), p. 116. (And note the similarity to McKerrow's remark quoted in footnote 23 above.) 44 "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography, and Literary Studies," PBSA , 46 (1952), 208. 45 On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists (1955), p. 35. 46 For example, in The Bibliographical Way (1959), he calls it the "scientific analysis of the physical evidence of the books themselves" (p. 8). Generally, however, he speaks of "laws of evidence" (p. 10) or "a logical method of analysis" (p. 34) without direct reference to science. Describing analytical bibliography in "The Function of Bibliography," he said, "The evidence utilized is circumstantial and physical, and the method, it may be said, is inductive" ( Library Trends , 7 [1959], 498). And in the current Encyclopaedia Britannica article his analogy is not with science but with law: "The evidence utilized is circumstantial and physical, and would often be legally valid." 47 Published in 1964 as Bibliography and Textual Criticism . 48 The situation is not unlike that in which McKerrow found himself when he wished to counteract what he regarded as overly subjective and eclectic procedures in the editing of Shakespeare: in order to make his point, he went farther in the direction of rigidity than he would probably have gone if he had not been reacting against what seemed to him a lack of discipline. As Bowers sums up the matter, "it often appears that in his general editorial theory McKerrow's thinking was affected more by reaction to that of others than by positive theory of his own"; see "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," SQ , 6 (1955), 309-24, which stresses McKerrow's reaction against Dover Wilson's use of supposedly "scientific" bibliographical methods. In this context Bowers sees a "pettishness" in McKerrow's comments on scientific method (quoted above)—though what "pettishness" there is may also reflect a more general impatience with the scientific analogy. 49 It is not surprising that recent efforts to introduce French-speaking scholars to analytical and descriptive bibliography should utilize the scientific analogy. See, for example, Roger Laufer, "Pour une description scientifique du livre en tant qu'objet matériel," Australian Journal of French Studies , 3 (1966), 252-72, and "La bibliographie matérielle dans ses rapports avec la critique textuelle, l'histoire littéraire et la formalisation," Revue d'histoire littéraire de la France , 70 (1970), 776-83—which speaks of analytical bibliography as "une discipline archéologique annexe de l'histoire" (p. 781), with problems similar to those posed by "la description des objets archéologiques" (p. 782). See also Wallace Kirsop's articles, such as "Vers une collaboration de la bibliographie matérielle et de la critique textuelle," Australian Journal of French Studies , 3 (1966), 227-51. 50 See footnote 3 above. McKenzie had made some of the same points earlier in the introductory remarks to An Early Printing House at Work: Some Notes for Bibliographers (1965). 51 "Induction," in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy , ed. Paul Edwards (1967), 4: 176. 52 A convenient summary of points of view appears in Peter Caws's article on "Scientific Method" in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy , 7: 339-43. 53 Something along these lines is what is sometimes known as the "linguistic" approach to the problem of induction; I quote again from Max Black, an advocate of this point of view: "The inductive concepts that we acquire by example and formal education and modify through our own experiences are not exempt even from drastic revision. . . . What is clearly impossible, however, is the sort of wholesale revolution that would be involved in wiping the inductive slate clean and trying to revert to the condition of some hypothetical Adam setting out to learn from experience without previous indoctrination in relevant rules of inductive procedure. This would be tantamount to attempting to destroy the language we now use to talk about the world and about ourselves and thereby to destroy the concepts embodied in that language. The idea of ceasing to be an inductive reasoner is a monstrosity. The task is not impossibly difficult; rather, its very formulation fails to make sense" ( Encyclopedia , p. 179). The common-sense defense of induction does not of course answer the philosophical objections. As Black, in "The Raison d'Etre of Inductive Argument"—included in his Margins of Precision (1970)—says, "There is no way to cope with the 'problem' that, in my opinion, offers any prospect of satisfying those to whom its solution seems necessary except by patiently exposing the underlying confusions until the alleged problem withers away" (p. 177). He sees "no stultifying circularity" in holding that "there is indeed good inductive evidence for thinking that our universe is of such a character that continued trust in the inductive practice is reasonable." 54 "I am not happy," he says, "about my need to use these terms ['inductive' and 'deductive'], and I hope they will be accepted in just the rough-and-ready, practical sense intended by Bacon" (p. 36). Bowers has made some comments on McKenzie's article in "Seven or More Years?", Shakespeare 1971 , ed. C. Leech and J. M. R. Margeson (1972), pp. 50-51. 55 Elsewhere Bowers describes the search for extant copies of a book in such a way as to emphasize the open-ended quality of inductive procedure: ". . . although no way exists to protect oneself against the unique copy of a variant in a private collection, or in some out-of-the-way small library which one would not ordinarily consult, one's coverage should be so wide as materially to reduce the odds that an unknown variant will turn up later to dim one's hopes for completeness. (The number of variants I have already seen in unique copies does not give me any great confidence, however, that an equal number still does not lie in wait, unknown and unsung, waiting for my book to be printed.)" See "Bibliography and Restoration Drama," in Bibliography (Clark Library, 1966), p. 4. 56 Indeed, he doubts that the concept of "normality" is meaningful "in any serious and extended sense" (see pp. 4-6). 57 See footnote 3 above; the essay is republished, in revised form, as a chapter in his book Principles of Textual Criticism (1972), pp. 50-79. The sentence from this paper quoted below is the same in both versions, and the citation is to the 1972 publication. 58 In the third chapter of Principles of Textual Criticism , pp. 80-104. It is his thesis in this chapter that bibliographers have attempted to "make textual criticism a branch of bibliography" (p. 101), and he provides a historical survey to exhibit "the process by which bibliography has taken over textual criticism" (p. 89). Although he says, "This development very closely parallels the twentieth-century association of science and bibliography," the survey of the scientific analogy which I presented earlier suggests that his view is somewhat overstated. He concludes that "textual criticism cannot properly have a single methodology" (p. 104), but it does not seem that the leading bibliographers ever suggested that it should. The issue is really whether or not the "bibliographical orientation" of textual criticism is excessive—a matter which cannot be decided on theoretical grounds. If analytical bibliographers can accept being plumbers rather than scientists, they would no doubt agree with Thorpe's final assessment: "The tools of one trade will not repair every breakdown, and the special expertise that the textual critic ought to possess is that of a skilled and knowledgeable handyman. He is not a plumber or an electrician, but he must know how to deal with pipes and wiring" (p. 104). 59 See footnote 3 above; Davison also offers in this essay a criticism of Thorpe's method of selecting quotations (pp. 5-6). He had presented some of the same points about McKenzie's paper earlier in "Marry, Sweet Wag," in The Elizabethan Theatre II , ed. David Galloway (1970), pp. 134-43. 60 In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962). Davison is aware of, and comments on, the fact that he is introducing another scientific analogy by referring to this concept. 61 See footnote 3 above. I do not propose here to go into this part of Peckham's paper; I believe it does no injustice to his argument to consider the first section (pp. 127-36) separately from the rest. 62 "Aestheticism to Modernism: Fulfillment or Revolution?" in The Triumph of Romanticism (1970), p. 204; the essay was originally published in 1967. 63 For a summary of some of the arguments, with a checklist for further reading, see Patrick Gardiner's "The Philosophy of History," in International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , ed. David L. Sills (1968), 6: 428-34, and his anthology Theories of History (1959); see also the chapters on the social sciences and history in Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science (1961), pp. 447-606. A few theories of historiography are summarized in a bibliographical context by William H. Goetzmann in his contribution to a symposium on "The Interdependence of Rare Books and Manuscripts: The Scholar's View," published in Serif , 9 (Spring 1972), 10-18. 64 McKenzie's point is specifically applied to history—theatrical history—by J. A. Lavin in "The Elizabethan Theatre and the Inductive Method," in The Elizabethan Theatre II , pp. 74-86. 65 The earlier part of this sentence reads, "Consequently the Bowers claim that analytical bibliography is a science is justifiable . . . ." I hope it is clear by this point that such a statement is an oversimplification and is characteristic of the kind of statements which have caused misunderstandings throughout the history of the scientific analogy. 66 See, for example, footnote 11 above; Library Journal , 1 (1876-77), 69; Library Association Record , 2 (1900), 174—these last two in almost identical wording. 67 J. D. Cowley, in Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing (1939), defined historical bibliography in such a way as to bring together the questions about its scientific and its independent status: historical bibliography (as opposed to subject bibliography and textual criticism), he said, is "a science, if that term is used to mean any field of knowledge or knowing which is worth while approaching for its own sake" (p. 7). 68 See, among other places, Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 1 (1892-93), 34; Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932-33), 113. 69 In the "Early Americana" section of Standards of Bibliographical Description (1949), Lawrence Wroth says that "bibliography is not an end but a means, a process in the study of the transmission of texts" (p. 105), and that unless it is regarded in this spirit it becomes "a species of research which closely approaches sterility" (p. 107). Curt Bühler, in the same volume, calls it "an ancillary investigation to the study of the text" (p. 8). E. E. Willoughby makes a similar comment in The Uses of Bibliography to the Students of Literature and History (1957): "Bibliography, in my opinion, is an ancillary science. It serves its true function when it is an efficient tool to solve problems in history, literature or some like subject" (p. 17). 70 "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 22; though his article is specifically on descriptive bibliography, the comment quoted here refers to bibliography "in its several essential forms." This is only one of several similar statements Bowers has made; another was quoted above (and referred to in footnote 41). It is true that earlier, in the opening chapter of his Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), he was more concerned with presenting descriptive bibliography as the "history of an author's book," not a mere guide to "points"; and in this context he quoted Wroth's comments as support (p. 9), called bibliography a "bridge" to textual criticism (pp. 9, 11), and said that "bibliography would be a limited science indeed if collection of external facts were its sole reason for existence" (p. 8). Some later writers have persisted in expressing doubt about the independent status of bibliography. Roy Stokes, for example, in The Function of Bibliography (1969), claims, "Although bibliography is concerned with the physical problems and aspects of such material, there is little to be gained, apart from purely anitquarian pleasure, in unravelling such problems for their own sake. The major interest will always lie in some relationship to the text which is being transmitted" (p. 17). And E. W. Padwick, in the opening chapter of Bibliographical Method (1969), reports, as if it were a novel idea, that "contemporary leading exponents such as Professor Fredson Bowers wish to see it [bibliographical scholarship] accepted as an independent discipline no longer to be regarded solely as a handmaid of literature" (p. 12). 71 See the discussion in Randolph G. Adams, Three Americanists (1939), p. 9. 72 Theory and History of Bibliography , trans. Ralph R. Shaw (1934), p. 24; other comments about science and bibliography appear on pp. 20-24. 73 I have touched on this question in more detail in "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), 1-12. 74 As opposed to what may be called "creative editing"; I have made further comments on this distinction in PBSA , 65 (1971), 113-14. 75 The case is not altered, it seems to me, even when the text under consideration is one that would not conventionally be regarded as "literary"; obviously a knowledge of the subject matter taken up in the text is essential, but something beyond that is required. 76 The pointlessness of many of the discussions about whether one or another of the social sciences is really "scientific" is suggested by Ernest Nagel when he says that "the requirements for being a genuine science tacitly assumed in most of the challenges lead to the unenlightening result that apparently none but a few branches of physical inquiry merit the honorific designation" ( The Structure of Science , p. 449). 77 That is to say, in more elaborate terms, pursuits which are not principally nomothetic. 78 "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism," in Selected Prose , ed. John Carter (1961), p. 149. 79 David Shaw, in an extremely interesting article ("A Sampling Theory for Bibliographical Research," Library , 5th ser., 27 [1972], 310-19) published after the present article was written, comes to a similar conclusion. He works out a way of applying the sampling theory developed by statisticians to the bibliographical problem of determining how many copies of a book provide a significant body of evidence. At the end he recognizes that a "preoccupation with scientific method . . . is generally to be welcomed, provided that it leads to practical results and not solely to doctrinal disputes about the methodologies. My suggestion of a greater application of probability theory in fact favours a continuation of business as before, rather than a great upheaval in bibliographical method." Instead of arguing the advantages of induction or deduction, as he says earlier, his concern "is more simply cautionary. Whatever system of reasoning one uses or thinks one is using, due caution is a most scholarly virtue" (p. 316).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Justification and Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B by S. W. Reid</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Justification of lines is undoubtedly the most familiar and important of the many influences that affect a Renaissance compositor's normal spelling habits. It has long been an assumption among students of early books that before the eighteenth century compositors justified by deviating from their normal spellings as well as by inserting or removing spaces. And only recently William S. Kable has actually shown that in the Pavier Quartos there is a large proportion of Jaggard Compositor B's departures from preferred spellings in long lines, and has argued that these spellings were altered to fit the type within the measure. 1 However, the influence of justification on compositorial spelling involves more than this practice. An example of justification cited by Kable (p. 16) is especially interesting. Whichever previous quarto of 2 Henry VI —Q1 (1594) or Q2 (1600)—served as copy for the Pavier Q3 (and there seems to be some question about the matter 2 ), B was faced with a full line of verse in his copy, and he apparently shortened his normal spellings as he set his line to avoid filling his own measure with letter, thereby producing the following: Hum . But clokes &amp; gowns ere this day many a one. The spellings clokes , &amp; , and gowns are not characteristic of B's Pavier work. This particular instance is evidence of a general practice that has for some time been suspected. In discussing justification during the Renaissance generally, R. B. McKerrow carefully writes as follows: "If when nearing the end of a line the [compositor] saw that he was going to have space to fill up, he could add an e to the end of some of the words . . . ." 3 What McKerrow is quietly suggesting is that deliberately "justified" 4 spelling could occur during the initial typesetting of a line rather than after the end of the measure had been reached. Professor Hinman also has suggested essentially the same thing in his work on the First Folio of Shakespeare (I, 187, and n.), and in a private letter he adds: "I think we have all perhaps tended to recognize insufficiently that all lines, 'short' as well as 'long,' might have to be justified—hence that spelling might be affected by this requirement even in short lines . . . ." 5 The problem here is an obvious and familiar one: lack of precise knowledge. We know that justification often could affect spelling, but we do not know how often it did. The knowledge that it could, as Hinman's comment reveals, casts doubt on the validity of much spelling evidence commonly cited, in short as well as long lines. Yet no one would seriously suggest that even in long lines every spelling is affected by the need to justify. For instance, in the Folio pages set from known printed copy, 6 B uses only 1(L) doe spelling in a long line, but he sets 24(L) preferred do spellings, 9(L) of these instead of copy's doe ; B uses the ampersand only in long lines in the Folio—15(L) times he changes copy's and to &amp; and follows 1(L) copy &amp; , all in long lines—but 16(L) times he sets and where copy has &amp; and 114(L) times retains copy's and in long lines. Can we seriously doubt that at least a few of these do and and spellings in long lines exhibit his habitual preference for do and and , like the numerous spellings in short lines? Up to now we have been forced to disregard all such long-line spellings, to consider them, in effect, useless, even though some have recognized that such a practice is illogical. 7 But surely as our methods of investigation become more sophisticated and facts accumulate, the recognition that all spellings affected by justification need not appear in fully long lines must be paralleled by an equally important recognition that all spellings in long lines need not be affected by justification. Naturally, the problem is to distinguish justified from unjustified spellings, and to do so we must bring to bear on the question all the relevant information available. Although the practices of a single compositor can hardly define a norm, yet the knowledge we now have of Compositor B's general spelling practices may suggest several possible approaches to the problem and perhaps even identify certain classes of his spellings that are not usually influenced by justification and that therefore may serve as primary evidence of his normal habits. 8 Before turning to an analysis of the internal evidence of B's justifying practices in certain Folio texts set from known printed copy, we should review what is known from roughly contemporary sources about Jacobean justification and the conditions affecting it. Moxon is, of course, the best such source, and since justifying a line is essentially fitting types of various sizes within a given measure, it seems reasonable to begin with his comments on letter cutting. He writes in part: And as there is three Heighths or Sizes to be considered in Letters Cut to the same Body, so is there three Sizes to be considered, with respect to the Thicknesses of all these Letters, when the Punches are to be Forged: For some are m thick; by m thick is meant m Quadrat thick, which is just so thick as the Body is high: Some are n thick; that is to say, n Quadrat thick, viz. half so thick as the Body is high: And some are Space thick; that is, one quarter so thick as the Body is high; though Spaces are seldom Cast so thick, as shall be shewed when we come to Casting : and therefore, for distinction sake, we shall call these Spaces, Thick Spaces. 9 Elsewhere (p. 170) he writes of " Spaces Thick and Thin, n Quadrats , m Quadrats and Quadrats ." Twice again he refers to "the Thin or Thick Space " and then remarks (p. 171): "It is generally observed by Work-men as a Rule, That when they Cast Quadrats they Cast them exactly to the Thickness of a set Number of m's or Body , viz. two m's thick, three m's thick, four m's thick, &amp;c ." But lest we be elated over this apparently precise information, in defining the thin space he writes (p. 353): " Thin Space , ought by a strict orderly and methodical measure to be made of the Thickness of the seventh part of the Body ; though Founders make them indifferently Thicker or Thinner." Finally, Moxon refers to the size of spaces in discussing justification itself (p. 207): Having Composed one Line , if it ends with a Word or Syllable and a Division , and just fill the Measure , it needs no more Justifying ; but if the Line conclude not as aforesaid, then he puts a Space more between every Word, or so many Words as will fill up the Measure pretty stiff, viz. Justifie the Line . But if the Line be not yet Justified , he puts another Space between every Word, or between several Words, till the Line be Justified : So that here is now three Spaces , and strictly, good Workmanship will not allow more . . . . And as Lines may be too much Spaced-out , so may they be too close Set : It may be accounted too close Set when only a Thin-space is set between Words, especially if no Capital Letter follows the Thin-space or Point go before it. Thin-spaces being intended and Cast only that the Compositor may Justifie his Lines the Truer, and not to serve for convenient distinction between Words. Obviously, the least satisfying aspect of these statements is Moxon's account of spaces. About their number, there is little uncertainty; the case of Moxon's time had five—thin and thick spaces, en quads, em quads, and larger quads. McKerrow's comment (p. 10) that the Elizabethan compositor normally used no more than two spaces perhaps derives from Moxon's statements, and I suppose that T. H. Howard-Hill counts the en-quad as a space when he writes that "compositors had available spaces of three different sizes below quads of which two were most frequently used, generally between words" (p. 8). About the important matter of the thicknesses of these two spaces we have less than precise information. Moxon is equivocal about it, and probably different fonts had spaces of different thicknesses. One way of determining the thicknesses in the Folio would be to measure the impressions of spaces that have worked up in various uncorrected formes. Hinman has noted some of these as press variants, and the results of such measuring could be correlated with the dimensions of white space at the end of lines not quite filling the Folio measure. In measuring the work-ups, it might also pay to make notes on the relation of the faces of the adjacent letters to their bodies. Because of the irregular casting of the time, our information on spaces and the letters themselves may never be precise, but we need to know more than we do now. Until this is done—and I have not had the opportunity myself—several questions related to the use of spaces in justification must remain unanswered. Chief among these is whether in justifying a compositor would resort first to spacing or to altering spelling. McKerrow felt that the alteration of spelling was probably the compositor's "chief expedient"; on the other hand, Howard-Hill seems to regard spacing as "the most common" means of justification. 10 For now judgments on this question must remain speculative. My own observation leads me to believe that, in B's work at least, alteration of spelling was used more frequently to shorten lines, and alteration of spacing was used more frequently to lengthen them. This impression may lack some general significance because B's normal use of thin spaces between words and little spacing around pointing, on account of the short Folio measure, could be partly responsible for the phenomena noted. However, Howard-Hill has observed the same practice in other books, and a mental reconstruction of the justifying process suggests that such a practice is not unreasonable. 11 Moreover, it is clear from B's Folio work that he was especially disposed to lengthening lines by inserting spaces after pointing. 12 On the average, several instances of "pigeon holes" 13 following points occur on each of his pages. Ignorance of the size of spaces not only leaves us uncertain about the relative use of spacing and spelling in justification; it also makes imprecise our observations about the alteration of spelling in justifying any given line of type. The less we know about a compositor's normal practices of spacing, the more we have to rely on our imperfect knowledge of the compositor's normal practices of spelling the words in a given line. Without specific knowledge of how a compositor would normally space between words in his lines (specifically, short lines of verse) when not attempting deliberately to justify them, we cannot show hypothetically how a given long line would have looked had it been unaffected by justification. 14 Hence we cannot demonstrate in which direction a compositor had to alter a given line to justify it—whether by shortening or lengthening it—and therefore we have to rely wholly on general impressions and usually deficient knowledge of the compositor's spelling habits in deciding whether the line and what spellings in it are shorter or longer than they would otherwise be. Hence, too, we cannot calculate precisely the space that had to be made up either by altering spacing or spellings; therefore, we cannot determine with certainty exactly what thicknesses (of letter or spaces) were involved in the justifying process. 15 Finally, it follows from these facts that we cannot prove beyond any reasonable doubt that a particular spelling in a particular long line was not influenced by deliberate justification. Under these circumstances we are left with making and correlating observations of the compositor's spelling in long lines that, however sufficient for defining his general practices, cannot demonstratively identify spellings that are not "justified" in a particular line. Nevertheless, it may not be impossible or entirely idle to draw, from an analysis of the large body of information now available on his spelling, several rather tentative conclusions about B's general practices of altering spellings when deliberately justifying lines. One important conclusion about spelling and justification can be reached with some confidence, on the basis of both a few of Moxon's remarks and some observation of B's work. Moxon states that there are three different thicknesses of letters: em, half-em (or en), and quarter-em. Now by far the most frequent thickness is the en. Of this size are obviously the letters b , d , p , and q ; c , e , and o ; h , n , and u ; s , x , and z ; v , y , and k ; and g and a . Identifying the thicknesses of r , t , f , and long s is perhaps more difficult, but two lines in The Old Wives Tale (1595) cited by Howard-Hill ("Spelling," p. 9) are helpful. Lines 971 and 978 on sig. E4 read: For feare you make the gouldē beard to weepe. For feare thou make the gouldē beard to weep. Here the space filled by the final e in weepe has been taken by the t in thou without making more room in the line. The letters t , r , f , and long s all seem to be en thick, as do the ligatures long st and si , fi , fl , and probably ff , the contractions y e , y u , and y t , the query ( ? ), and the numerals 2-0. Of em thickness are m , the ligatures ct , ffi , and long sh , probably the diagraphs æ and œ , the contraction &amp; , and probably w . Belonging to the quarter-em (half-en) class are i and l , numeral I , and the comma, period, and apostrophe, as well as the exclamation mark when it appears. The implications of these facts are clear and important, though perhaps not profound: spelling variations involving the interchange of letters of equal thickness need not be disregarded when they occur in long lines, because they could not have been a material factor in justifying the line. Spacially, nothing is achieved by substituting s for z , c for k , or e for a . Hence B's spelling of important words such as 'dear' and 'near', with variation between internal vowels -ea- and -ee- , can be analyzed on the basis of almost all evidence, in spite of the fact that often some of the spellings are in long lines. A glance at his spelling of these words in long lines shows that no variation from his normal habits occurs under these circumstances. Although when recording spelling we probably should not blindly mix the occurrences in long lines with those in short nor blithely ignore the difference, justification cannot be a physical factor in B's spelling of such words. Equally certain conclusions about the effect of justification on B's spelling are not feasible given our present knowledge, but it is not impossible to make some other observations and to suggest that when setting two or more prose lines, Compositor B generally typeset most or all of the line before beginning to alter spelling, if further justifying was needed, and then worked back along the line changing appropriate spelling or spacing as the opportunity presented itself, whereas when setting long verse lines or single prose lines, he sometimes—but not always—varied from this general practice and shortened spellings when possible as he initially set the line. Moxon's account of the justifying process itself (p. 207) pictures the compositor setting to the end of his line and, if necessary, going back over it to insert or remove spaces until a "pretty stiff" line of type is made, but the applicability of his account to a Renaissance compositor's practice is uncertain for several reasons. First, Moxon, writing in the early 1680's, does not recognize alteration of spelling as a viable means of justifying a line. Second, he is speaking only of setting prose. Third, he does not allow for the kind of anticipatory justification that McKerrow and Hinman allow for and that Kable finds in one line of B's work. The complexities of justification are attested by the fact that these points are all inextricably related; the last two are especially important. Although the physical conditions (as they affect spelling) are identical, obviously justification of prose and verse are somewhat different: the former involves both shortening and lengthening of lines that is dictated by physical conditions, whereas the latter, though it involves shortening of lines and the same physical conditions, does not usually include lengthening lines and is left largely to the discretion of the compositor. 16 When setting continuous prose, a compositor would normally expect to have to justify each line full of letter; except in the case of short prose statements, he would expect his text to "over-run" 17 from one line to the next until he had reached the end of a paragraph. Hence, there would be nothing to be gained, and probably much mental labor lost, in his trying to keep his lines as long or as short as possible while setting them. 18 Anticipatory justification would accomplish little unless the particular compositor were especially skilled at such guess-work; Moxon's method would be less demanding and more amiable. On the other hand, when setting verse or a series of short prose lines, there would be much to recommend the procedure of setting as short lines as possible by means of anticipatory justification. Adopting this procedure a compositor would tend both to save space and to avoid leaving a short word or two dangling in a type line by itself. The desirability of this procedure is especially acute at the beginning of a play, canto, or similar literary division, where an ornamental initial or factotum occupies space at the left margin for three or four lines. What can be involved in such cases is illustrated by a line and a half at MV , 8 (sig. O4), set by two different Renaissance compositors as a fourteener amidst blank verse. 19 Q1: [Initial] I am to learne: and such a want-wit sadnes makes of mee, Q2: [Initial] I am to learne: &amp; such a want-wit sadnes makes of me F1: I am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of mee, B set both Q2 and F1 from Q1; in both cases he produced a line that used space less effectively and was even less pleasing to the eye than his copy. Beginning his line just below the initial in F1 he could have fit it all to the measure had he violated his preferences by setting &amp; and sadnes , as in Q2, and learn . Instead, he ended by spelling mee in a line by itself, contrary to his preference, perhaps following the copy spelling to make as long a word as possible. On the other hand, in Q2 B anticipated his justification problem by setting &amp; and sadnes against very strong preferences, but failed to keep within his type line because of the initial. He was more successful, however, in the example of anticipatory justification in 2H6 cited by Kable, where he set clokes , &amp; , and gowns contrary to his preferences and kept within the line. These manifestly different considerations in setting verse and prose should be kept in mind when we examine a compositor's spellings in justified lines. Whether or not B set his lines according to the method described by Moxon or by anticipatory justification is perhaps best investigated through a comparison of his spelling of the same word occurring twice in the same long line. The advantages of this procedure are evident: all conditions are essentially the same, and, more important, the relative strength of the compositor's spelling preferences in different words is not an issue. The one disadvantage is that coincidence such as this does not often occur. In B's Folio work the variants and/&amp; are the best evidence for testing his practice of justification, since his use of the ampersand is governed almost wholly by his need to justify. It is true that in his Pavier work Kable finds B reproducing &amp; from copy's &amp; 4 times in short lines, in spite of his demonstrable preference for and . But in B's Folio work from known printed copy, no such spellings occur, whereas he alters copy's and to &amp; 15(L) times in long lines and follows 1 (L) &amp; of copy in a long line, while changing copy's &amp; to and 2 (+16L) times. This corresponds to his general practice in the Paviers, where he changes 29(L) and forms to &amp; in long lines and follows 4(L) cases of copy's &amp; in long lines, while altering 5 (+16L) &amp; spellings to and . 20 The pairing of and and &amp; in a single long line occurs only three times in B's Folio work from known printed copy. At IH4 , 752, the following prose line appears in the Folio: | any time this two and twenty yeare, &amp; yet I am bewitcht |; in Q5 copy it appears as: | . . . any time this 22. yeare, and yet I am be-| witcht . There is no influence of copy spellings in this case: and was created by B alone, and &amp; is a change from copy's and . Had B anticipated the need to shorten his line early in the initial typesetting of it, he would have been free to improvise &amp; , or even follow copy's 22 ; but the justification by altered spelling took place toward the end of the line. The second case of and/&amp; in a single long line appears in the stage-direction at Tit. , 86. 21 Here, too, in prose and appears in B's work at the beginning of the line and &amp; at the end. In both places copy has and . On the other hand, the third example of and/&amp; in a single long line occurs in a passage of verse ( IH4 , 378). The line is obviously lengthy in copy (Q5), and B sets it as follows: Of Guns, &amp; Drums, and Wounds: God save the marke; This is a fairly clear example of anticipatory justification and tends to confirm that such alteration of spelling occurred in verse lines. But the two previous examples suggest that in prose passages B set either to the very end, or nearly the end, of his line before beginning to alter his spellings to justify it. In a case like IH4 , 752, we cannot distinguish between justification toward the end of the line (such as McKerrow describes) and justification from the end of the line backwards (such as Moxon recommends). 22 Nevertheless, this evidence and that in Tit. , 86, show that justification took place toward the end of B's line. This is slim evidence to build a theory upon, of course, but it has its simplicity to recommend it. 23 Moreover, these few cases of relatively uncontaminated evidence can be supplemented by similar examples which support the hypothesis that B normally justified his prose by altering spellings toward the end of his line before working back over the rest of the line already set and changing type as the opportunity was presented. For instance, the contraction y e offered a means of shortening a line two ens by altering the spelling of one word. Such alteration occurs in F1 on sig. I3 ( Ado , 72), where B follows the first the of copy, but changes the second the of copy to y e . (Here also the last word in the line appears as block for copy's blocke , though B seems to favor generic -cke endings.) A parallel instance appears on sig. M5 ( LLL , 2478): the penultimate word in the line is y e , which replaces copy's the , whereas closer to the middle of the line the (for copy's the ) appears. B's preference for heere and its compounds is a strong one: in the Folio he alters known copy's here to heere 27 (+1L?, +6L, +2R, +1L?SD) times, besides retaining 18 (+2L, +4R, +1L?SD) heere forms of copy; he sets here only a total of 10(L) times, all in long lines (1 of these in a rhyme). It is of some interest, then, that at IH4 , 2925, heere: here's appears where copy has here, here's ; there are no spellings following here's that could have been shortened. 24 Less compelling, perhaps, are examples of words with the final -e/-ee spelling which, though not identical, were treated by B in an identical manner and which occur in the same line. B's practice of spelling 'be', 'he', 'me', and the like is consistent and at the same time subject to unpredictable, random variation. Nevertheless, his preference for generic -e , is incontestable. It is significant, therefore, that where such words occur together in a single long line, the -ee spelling always appears later than B's preferred -e . Copy's he is . . . he becomes he's . . . hee at Ado , 49; B sets copy's ye . . . ye . . . me as Ye . . . yee mee ( IH4 , 1103). Likewise, copy's hee . . . hee is set as he . . . hee , he feele . . . he heare as he feele . . . hee heare , and he be . . . he as he be . . . hee ( IH4 , 2146, 2775, 3087). Finally, although we now have no statistics on B's spelling of the words involved, three other cases of repetition of a single word within a single line are of interest. The first is at IH4 , 969: copy's three . . . foure . . . three or foure score becomes three . . . foure . . . 3. | or fourescore (literarily, the alteration of the first three is much to be preferred to that of the second). At LLL , 2403, the second instance occurs: copy's Some . . . some . . . some at the beginning, middle, and end of the line appears as Some . . . some . . . som. Som is apparently a form eschewed by B. It even is in a verse line, as is the third case: dost . . . dost in copy is set by B as do'st . . . dost ( IH4 , 435). These last two examples indicate that B did not always employ anticipatory justification when setting long verse lines. Moreover, since there are no examples of words repeated in long prose lines occurring first in B's non-preferred spelling and then in his preferred, present evidence suggests uniformly that B did not normally attempt to justify his prose lines as he initially set the words, but rather set at least nearly (if not entirely) to the end of each line before beginning to alter spellings to justify the line and, when necessary, worked back along each line altering the spellings that he had already put in type. The hypothesis that in order to justify his lines B generally altered spellings at the end of them before returning to alter preceding spellings already set, and that he sometimes departed from this practice when setting verse or single lines of prose finds support in collateral spelling evidence of three kinds. First, there are, in the same line, different words whose spellings could be varied by adding or removing letters of equal thickness, and for which B possessed preferential spellings that are identifiable from the evidence of his normal practice. Second, in the same line there are such words for some of which B's preferential spellings are not certainly identifiable because the evidence is incomplete or equivocal. Third, there are such words for some of which B's preferential spellings are not identifiable because we now have no evidence of his normal spelling practice. Of the three classes of words, the first obviously provides the most useful evidence of B's justifying practice. For example, in setting Ado , 609, from copy's know mee: . . . may be . . . goe , B had several alternatives when finding that the line lacked an en of filling the measure. First, he could insert an en quad after the colon following 'me', as he often did, or insert thin spaces between the words. Without precise knowledge about spacing, we cannot say with confidence that he ignored this alternative, but it appears that he did. Second, he could lengthen any of the words by adding (or retaining from copy) a final -e : knowe , mee , maye , bee , goe were all spelling alternatives open to the seventeenth-century compositor. What B apparently did, however, was to set his preferred spellings know, may , be , and me (from copy's mee ) and to violate his preference for go by setting the spelling goe (as in copy). Now, it is clear from the Folio and Pavier evidence that B was much more tolerant of mee and bee than he was of goe . In the Folio alone he alters 5 (+3L, +1R) me spellings of known printed copy to mee and retains 2 mee forms of copy, while changing 7 (+4L, +1R) mee spellings to me and reproducing 147 (+10L?, +60L, +8R, +1LR) me forms. The spelling be is also clearly his preference, but he alters 2 (+1L?, +9L, +1R, +1LSD) be copy spellings to bee , while changing 1(L) bee of copy to be in a long line and retaining 116 (+6L?, +44L, +2R) be copy spellings. On the other hand, this goe is the only one in B's Folio work from known printed copy, whereas 23 (+2L?, +1L, +1R, +1SD, +1L?R, +1L?SD) other goe copy spellings are rejected in favor of go . In short, the relative position of these words in this line, and not B's normal habits, seems to have been the determining factor. Somewhat less certain is the relative strength of his tolerance for knowe and maye as opposed to goe . The spelling maye does not occur either in B's Pavier or Folio copy; he usually sets may (the only spelling in the Folio and its copy), and chooses 22 may forms against Pavier copy's maie . Hence the infrequency with which he was exposed to maye could well have been a factor in his reluctance to justify by using it, and may in the present case is as likely to reflect this reluctance as to reveal his justifying practice. The same applies in a lesser degree to know , which is B's usual spelling; Pavier copy has only 4 knowe spellings, which B alters to know , and Folio copy has 1(L) that he alters to know while also setting 1(L) knowe for copy's know . From this meagre evidence, it is difficult to compare the strength of B's preference for go and intolerance for goe with his preference for know and intolerance of knowe . Again such relative strengths, rather than position in the line, may have determined B's use of preferential know as opposed to non-preferred goe . It should be clear from this protracted discussion of the spellings in this one long line that we must evaluate each similar case of spellings on its own merits from what is known (and not known) about B's normal habits. The evidence of Ado , 609, is qualitatively at least as good—if not better—evidence as that cited earlier for our hypothesis about B's methods of justification. Evidence similar to that in Ado , 609, occurs in prose lines set by B throughout his Folio work from known printed copy; the following table contains the best such examples. Table I Copy Folio Citation Never . . . house . . . likenesse Never . . . house . . . likenes Ado , 96 Sell . . . thinke . . . would sel . . . thinke . . . wold 601 poore . . . shee's quicke the childe bragges poore . . . she's quick, the child brags LLL , 2632 all . . . will . . . heere all . . . will . . . here MND , 359 knowne . . . meane time . . . will . . . bill knowne . . . meane time . . . wil . . . bil 365 wee . . . ore . . . hee We . . . ore . . . hee MV , 2065 stead . . . lacke . . . yeeres be sted . . . lacke . . . years be 2069 downe . . . beare mine owne . . . far afoot againe downe . . . beare mine owne . . . far afoot again 1H4 , 770 theeves . . . and . . . feare Theeves . . . and . . . fear 842 prethee . . . roome, and lend prethee . . . roome, &amp; lend 966 say . . . be say . . . bee 2150 xxii . . . ther | about . . . hainously . . .

Wel 2199 been poore . . . here comes beene poore . . . here comes Rom. , 34 In addition to these examples in prose lines, there are spellings in several Folio lines of verse which suggest that B did not always employ anticipatory justification when setting long verse lines but sometimes varied the last spellings in a given line before returning to change preceding spellings. Table II lists these. Table II Copy Folio Citation sayle, and heere she coms amaine saile, and here she coms amain LLL , 2489 Keepe . . . looke here comes Keepe . . . looke here comes MND , 190 hart . . . foure heart . . . four MV , 2057 thank . . .

Armes . . . thrown 2827 These spellings indicate that when setting verse (and probably single lines of prose) B sometimes followed the procedure he commonly used when setting prose passages, instead of shortening spellings as he initially set the line. On the other hand, other spellings imply that B's method of justifying such lines was variable, for it corroborates the theory (supported by 1H4 , 378, discussed above) that at times when setting verse B anticipated the need to justify by shortening his normal spellings as he set the line. B's spelling Moon set from Q2 Moone ( MND , 6) next to an ornamental initial shows anticipatory justification: two words later the long me thinkes is spelled out from copy's short me-thinks . Other examples in MND are harts do feare from Q2's hearts do feare (2022) and Sweet Moone . . . thank . . . beames from Q2's Sweete Moone . . . thank . . . beames (2075). In other Folio plays collated there are two examples: in a line lacking three ens of the measure, Marry . . . wel . . . carried , shall . . . behalfe is set from known copy's Mary . . . well . . . caried , shall . . . behalfe ( Ado , 1874), and copy's finds means . . . kil . . . joyes becomes finds meanes . . . kill . . . joyes ( Rom. , 3167). The second class of words also supports this view of B's general practice of justifying his lines. Table III contains words in prose and Table IV words in verse for some of which B's preferred spellings are certainly identifiable and for some not certainly identifiable but which all imply that B generally varied spellings toward the end of his lines before altering those toward the beginning.

For instance, no statistics on B's spelling of 'there' are now available, although experience shows that ther was a form usually eschewed by B. Hence, it is risky to rest too much weight on the there's . . . between (set from copy's there's . . . betweene ) of Ado , 60, or on the honour . . . ther's (copy reads honour . . . theres ) of 1H4 , 2954, even though the spelling variants involve types of equal thickness. The following are similar examples in prose and verse. Table V Folio Citation shew it selfe . . . badg Ado , 25 tongue . . . mask LLL , 2157 worne plain 2202 Faire . . . Wher's . . .

Plotte 1H4 , 865 could scape . . . fear 2924 prethee . . . breath awhile 2938 Bils . . . strike, beat . . . down Rom. , 72 That B sometimes varied from his usual practice when setting verse or single lines of prose is indicated by several spellings of words in this class. The spelling Worster ( 1H4 , 2646) set from copy's Worcester , the normal spelling in B's Folio pages of this play, probably exhibits anticipatory justification of a verse line. So do the spellings bils here . . . &amp; challeng'd ( Ado , 39) and wil turne . . . ballance ( MND , 2112). Since each piece of this spelling evidence of three kinds tends to confirm—with varying strength—the implications of the spellings of identical words, there is considerable evidence that in justifying, B generally varied spellings at the end of his line of prose—and sometimes of verse—before going back over the rest of the type line to alter further spellings, and that he sometimes departed from this practice when setting verse or single, non-continuous prose lines. There is also some evidence in B's Folio work that conflicts with this view of his general practice, but it is of such quantity and quality that the validity of the view need not be seriously doubted. Indeed, the only line where conflicting evidence is compelling is B's resetting in F1 of his own Q2 MND , 2015: Q2: Duke : The best, in this kinde, are but shadowes: and | the F1: Du . The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the | What spellings we have indicate that 'shadow' conforms to B's generic habit of preferring final -w and -wes : he follows the 1 shadow and the 1 shadowes of his Folio copy. B definitely prefers kinde in both the Paviers and the Folio: in his Folio work, for instance, he alters 5 (+1L, +1R) kind spellings in copy to kinde and retains 2 kinde forms, while in long lines B's kind reproduces copy's kind 1(L) time and his kinde replaces copy's kind 1(L) time. Yet in MND , 2015, kind is clearly the justified spelling. Either this implies that B overlooked by choice or accident the possible deletion of the -e- in shadowes , or that in setting the line he saw from his own Q2 work that justification would be needed and simply set kind when he came to it. 25 These alternatives are equally plausible, especially since it is obvious that oversights and unaccountable variation were not strange to B. Besides this one example, however, there are no other spellings in Folio prose lines set from known printed copy that unoquivocally point to variation from the general practice which we have noted. Possible conflicting evidence occurs, but it is not compelling. At LLL , 2643, moved . . . Atees . . . Atees . . . stirre appears in place of copy's mooved . . . Ates . . . Atees . . . stir , but had B tried to justify by dropping -re from his preferred stirre , his line would have lacked one en, and mooved was therefore, so far as we know, the next candidate for alteration. At MV , 2072, the Folio has trial shall where Q1 has tryall shall (Q2 reads triall shall ), but although B's preference is -i- and he consistently tolerates -ll in 'trial', his treatment of 'shall' is unpredictable, as is his treatment generally of the final -l/-ll alternative. These two cases are clearly inconclusive; other conflicting evidence, even less conclusive, is as follows in Table VI. Table VI Copy Folio Citation kind . . . mery warre . . . and her kind . . . merry war . . . &amp; her Ado , 59 Me-thinks she . . . long one Me thinkes shee . . . long one MND , 2110 Sacke be . . . jeast . . . and a foot Sacke be . . . jest . . . &amp; a foote 1H4 , 780 skim milke . . . honorable . . . hang skim'd Milk . . . honourable . . .

Finally, there is a type of evidence that supports the view that when justifying a line B generally altered types toward the end of it before changing those toward the beginning, but that is at present of unknown value, though in the future it may assume major importance. The value of evidence from spacing is currently compromised by our ignorance of the physical facts and by possibly other unknown factors. However, one striking characteristic of B's work in the Folio may be noted. As was mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, Compositor B seems prone to inserting spaces after punctuation to justify his lines. A survey of the Folio pages set by him from known printed copy reveals that the majority of the "pigeon holes" produced in this manner occur in the latter half of his lines. Of course, B's possible preference for spaces after periods rather than commas may play a part in this pattern that cannot presently be allowed for, but even when there are identical points in a single line (especially commas), a very large proportion of the pigeon holes occur next to the later punctuation. Thus this evidence confirms the implications of the better spelling evidence that B's normal practice in setting continuous prose lines was to set the whole or nearly the whole line in type first and then, if necessary, to begin varying spellings at the end of the line, working back along the line altering appropriate spellings as they presented themselves until the line was justified. Probably this practice usually involved shortening spellings, unless, after spacing out a short line, he found it necessary to lengthen a spelling to avoid producing unacceptable pigeon holes. On the other hand, in setting long verse lines—or long single prose lines—B sometimes shortened spellings when he could as he first set the line, thus producing a line of letter short of the measure but nevertheless affected by anticipatory, deliberate justification. This, of course, is only a provisional theory, based on evidence that requires a lot of inference to be applicable, and subject to revision—or extinction—as more precise information becomes available. Neverthe-less, it has one thing to recommend it: as Moxon's description of justification reveals, the procedure suggested here is sensible and pragmatic. Should it be confirmed by further investigation, especially of spacing, the effect of this theory would be two-fold. First, it would require that we bring under examination spellings, especially short ones, in lines of verse and single lines of prose ending within two or three ens of the measure. Second, it would rescue from virtual oblivion and uselessness a large number of other spellings. By careful examination of each long line in disputed texts, 26 we could identify, on the basis of previously determined habits, spellings actually influenced by justification and free some of the remaining spellings to serve as viable evidence of the copy behind the text. In a few cases this might mean the difference between doubt and mild confidence regarding a textual problem—a lot of work for very infrequent results, but where the texts of Shakespeare and his fellows are concerned, certainly worth the effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Kable, The Pavier Quartos and the First Folio of Shakespeare , Shakespeare Studies Monograph Series, No. 2 (1970), pp. 14-17; previously published as "The Influence of Justification on Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B," SB , 20 (1967), 235-239. Kable's views on the composition of the Paviers have recently been attacked by J. F. Andrews, "The Pavier Quartos of 1619: Evidence for Two Compositors," Diss. Vanderbilt 1971, and by Peter W. M. Blayney, "'Compositor B' and the Pavier Quartos: Problems of Identification and Their Implications," The Library , 5th Ser., 27 (September 1972), 179-206, but Andrews and Blayney do not agree with one another any more than they do with Kable about the printing of the Paviers. Since this issue is not crucial to the present discussion, the few times I refer to B's work in the Paviers I follow Kable's general findings, though taking account of corrections to his statistics. For more on this matter, see my "Spellings of Jaggard's Compositor B in Certain Plays in the First Folio of Shakespeare," Diss. Virginia 1972, p. 12, n. 1, p. 15 and n. 2, pp. 126-128. 2 Cf. Kable, pp. 8, 16; W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), p. 177; Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939), I, 119. The question is raised by Kable's use of Q2 (1600) as Q3 copy on p. 16 of his monograph; he follows Greg's Q1 assignment on p. 8. The line in Q1 ends with a turn-under. 3 An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1928; 1964), p. 11; see also p. 245. 4 The term "justified spellings" is used throughout to designate those spellings that presumably result more from B's need to justify his line by varying from his normal spelling habits, than from his inclination to choose gratuitously a certain spelling (see Kable's use of the term, p. 17). Although strictly speaking each line of type is justified (i.e., each is filled with pieces of type that make it a cohesive unit), it is now not uncommon to use the term "justification" in connection with lines where the letter itself extends to the end of the measure and, in addition, to use it when discussing lines that have been deliberately so typeset with spellings and spaces that they fill the type line. (See, for example, Kable's use, or Charlton Hinman's reference to lines that had to be "justified," that is, "to be either compressed or expanded . . . so as to fill out the length of the type line exactly" in The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare [1963], I, 186.) Lines that are thus deliberately justified may be said to contain at least some "justified spellings," or spellings affected by the compositor's conscious effort to fit a certain combination of letters into a type line, whereas lines that are not thus deliberately justified—either because they are "short" or because they fortuitously filled the type line when set—may be said to contain "unjustified" spellings. 5 I wish to thank Professor Hinman for permitting the publication of this statement. An aspect of this problem involving quartos especially is reviewed by John Feather, "Some Notes on the Setting of Quarto Plays," The Library , 5th Ser., 27 (1972), 237-244. 6 There are about thirty-one pages in F1 definitely set by B from Q1 Ado , Q1 LLL , Q1 MV , Q2 MND , Q5 IH4 , Q3 Tit. , and Q3 Rom . For the exact pages, see Reid, pp. 366-379. Throughout, the symbols L?, L, R, and SD designate, respectively, the number of spellings in nearly long lines ending within three or fewer ens of the measure, fully long lines, rhymes, and stage-directions. 7 See Kable's practice throughout his monograph or Hinman's practice as revealed in his treatment of sig. e4 v (II, 84). Cf. the carefully stated view of T. H. Howard-Hill, "Spelling and the Bibliographer," The Library , 5th Ser., 18 (March 1963), 9-10, and also Alan E. Craven, "Justification of Prose and Jaggard Compositor B," ELN , 3 (1965-66), 15-17. 8 For details on B's normal spelling habits, see Reid, esp. chs. 2 and 4. 9 Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , ed. Davis and Carter (1958), p. 103; subsequent quotations are from this edition. 10 McKerrow, p. 11; Howard-Hill, p. 8. Perhaps the conflict between these two views is more apparent than real; McKerrow tends to speak of justification mostly in terms of shortening the line to fit the measure, and for this end altering spelling may have been the principal means. Howard-Hill's latest observations on spacing, in "The Compositor's of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," SB , 26 (1973), 66-71, were seen after the present discussion had been written. 11 Such a procedure would be pragmatic and expeditious: extra letters could simply be omitted or, if already set in the line, easily extracted and redistributed without disturbing the relatively uniform spacing between words, whereas it would be less troublesome to insert spaces almost anywhere in the line than to search for spelling that could be lengthened and then pick out the needed letters. 12 Cf. the following—throughout, I use the TLN of The First Folio of Shakespeare : The Norton Facsimile , ed. Hinman (1968): Ado , 7, 34, 64, 76, 82, 83, 84, 559, 610, 612; LLL , 2159, 2181, 2444, 2481, 2509, 2661, 2676, 2680; MND , 351, 2034, 2042; MV , 2064; IH4 , 749, 766, 844, 854, 859, 860, 861, 926, 929, 978, 1054, 2162, 2773, 2774, 2926, 2939, 3085; Rom. , 59. 13 The term is Moxon's for inordinately large spaces in a printed line. 14 Cf., for particular examples of this difficulty, Ado , 609 (discussed below) and MND , 365 (cited in Table I). 15 For an example, see MND , 365, referred to in n. 14. 16 The compositor is free to set one verse line as one or two type lines, unless the need to "justify" his page to fit it to his cast-off copy forces one alternative upon him (see Hinman, II, 507). The line at MV , 8, cited below, provides a good example of compositorial choices, and also one of the infrequent instances of possible lengthening as well as shortening of lines in verse. 17 The term is Moxon's, p. 235. 18 An exception to this generalization might be a case where a compositor had to "justify" a whole page. 19 This assumes that Andrews' assignment of the page in Q2 to Compositor "F"—not to be confused with the F of T. H. Howard-Hill, "Compositors," pp. 84-88, hitherto identified with A—is incorrect or at least unproven. Were it proved correct, the point made here would not be affected. In quoting this and other lines, I have not attempted to reproduce the spacing and have modernized the u , v , i , and long s . 20 See Kable, p. 67. Blayney (p. 190 and nn. 25 and 26) questions the accuracy of Kable's figures on 'and', finding more &amp; spellings than Kable records, but whatever the precise figures for the Paviers, B uses &amp; only in long lines in F1. 21 This stage-direction may have been annotated, but if so, the annotation did not affect the words in the immediate vicinity of the case cited. See also, IH4 , 3135. B's spellings in stage-directions are, as a class, valid evidence; see Reid, pp. 172-178. 22 McKerrow, p. 11; Moxon, p. 207. These views have already been discussed above, pp. 92, 98. 23 By simplicity I mean that it is hard to find other conditions or factors that might occasion the phenomena and therefore contaminate their value as evidence. For instance, no influence from the spellings of neighboring words with similar orthographical characteristics could have led to B's choice of &amp; over and . 24 The validity of such evidence in compounds is shown in Reid, pp. 181-184. 25 The Folio and the Paviers were set from the same font of type, and of course the Folio measure was shorter. The statistics cited combine (legitimately) those for 'kind' sb. and adj. 26 That is, the texts of works, such as the Folio Ham., Oth. , and 2H4 , whose copy is still unknown or debated.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Beggars Bush : A Reconstructed Prompt-Book and Its Copy by Fredson Bowers *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The play Beggars Bush in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon is known in four early documents: (1) a private-transcript manuscript in the Lambarde volume preserved in the Folger Shakespeare Library; (2) a text in the 1647 Folio; (3) a separate quarto reprint in 1661 from this Folio without authority; (4) a text in the 1679 Folio reprinted from 1647 but with a few alterations that must derive from some authoritative source, either the Lambarde manuscript or its ancestor prompt-book. The Lambarde manuscript is in the hand of the scribe who wrote a presentation copy for the king of Suckling's Aglaura before the court performance of the Christmas season 1637/38, and is presumably of about the same date. The history of the date and composition of Beggars Bush is obscure. It has long been conjectured that more than one hand could be detected in the play. The latest and most careful study, based on the linguistic evidence of contractions and of forms like ye-you , hath-h'as-ha'-have , and doth-does , assigns Act I and V.ii.1-65 to Massinger, Acts II and V.i, ii.65-255 to Beaumont, and Acts III-IV to Fletcher. 1 Although difficulties are present in this assignment, on the whole it may serve as the basis for a working hypothesis. 2 As early as 1935 W. J. Lawrence observed the use of periods for commas in some of the stage-directions of the 1647 Folio 3 in the manner of Massinger's holograph Believe as You List and suggested that the copy had been partly in Massinger's hand and of his composition. 4 The late R. C. Bald in his Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 (1938), pp. 62-64, after noticing these periods remarked that the Lambarde manuscript on the other hand was manifestly transcribed from a prompt-copy and that its liberal use of colons to punctuate stage-directions suggested the hand of the scribe who wrote out the manuscript of The Honest Mans Fortune and who annotated Massinger's manuscript of Believe as You List . Called 'Jhon' by Bald, this scribe has more recently been identified as Edward Knight, who had connections with the King's Men in 1616 and is known in the early 1630's, and probably before, to have been their book-keeper. The date of Knight's transcript of the prompt-book almost certainly cannot have approximated that of the original composition and sale of the play if it were indeed one of Beaumont's last contributions to the stage, probably in 1613-14, when Massinger was beginning to take over as Fletcher's collaborator. The stylistic evidence clearly indicates that Massinger was one of the play's original authors and his connection with it was not that of a later reviser. On the whole it is easier to interpret the evidence that Knight's prompt-book was transcribed in the early 1620's (possibly even for the court performance on December 27, 1622, or at any later date, as for court performances in 1630 or 1636) than to argue that Massinger's share in the play was that of a reviser. 5 Fortunately, the matter of the divided authorship is not of major importance for the present enquiry since the evidence of the idiosyncratic periods in the stage-directions appears to establish that the manuscript given to the printer of the 1647 Folio was a fair copy by Massinger of substantially the whole play (possibly excepting V.ii. 65-255 in the original papers), his copy being the holograph papers of the other authors as well as his own. Similarly, the idiosyncratic colons in the directions of the Lambarde manuscript establish the presence of the book-keeper Edward Knight in its copy, although the Lambarde manuscript is of course not in his hand. 6 The relationship between the texts of the Folio and MS has not previously been studied in detail. A multiplicity of 'bibliographical links' establishes that the copy behind each, although not identical, was relatively similar in its accidental characteristics. Only a sample need be given. If we take I.iii as an example, the work of Compositor A in the Folio after the first dozen lines, we find that in line 15 both texts spell the city as Bruges but in line 54 both have the rare variant Brugis . At line 23 both have a colon after way and follow with a capitalized But against their usual practice; both want a comma that might be expected after denyall in line 35; both have a colon after prosperity (40), a purely caesural comma after price (68), no pointing after ' em (85), parentheses at 93-95 and 105, 7 and another colon followed by an unusual capital at 103. MS spells Indico, Quitcheneel and Folio Indico , Quitchineel (120); more parentheses come at 148 and 150; at 65 both texts spell 'pric'd' as priz'd although price (as a noun) is found in both at 68 but prices in MS and prizes in F at 126; and at 157 both agree in preheminence . Elsewhere, both agree in the important matter of erroneous verse lining at I.iii.128-129; II.i.51-52, 62-63, 181-182, 200-201; III.i.144; III.ii.31; III.iv.145-146; III.v.38-39; IV.i.37-38; V.i.27-28; and V.ii.248-249. Cumulatively, the number of agreements in small details despite compositorial styling in F and double scribal styling in MS indicates that in many more cases than might reasonably have been expected, characteristics of a basic underlying copy have been preserved in both documents. A simple conclusion can be drawn from the total evidence: 8 the original fair copy made by Massinger for the King's Men was preserved and was given to the printer of the 1647 Folio. Correspondingly, these identical papers had previously been copied by Edward Knight to make up a prompt-book; and from this prompt-book was copied the presentation Lambarde MS. The evidence permits no other ready interpretation, and no unknown intermediaries appear to exist in this transmission. Hence the Folio is at one remove from the Massinger fair copy—the closest we can get to the original authorial papers—and the MS is at two removes. The relationship thus is a radiating one in which the branch represented by MS derives from Massinger's papers through Knight's lost prompt-book. The establishment of this relationship between the two major preserved documents offers a valuable opportunity to compare a prompt-book with its immediate source, the fair-copy manuscript given to the company by one of the authors. The opportunity is the more to be treasured in that a possible date for Knight's transcript closely approximates the printing of the Shakespeare First Folio. Many speculations about the printer's copy given Jaggard at this time, and how it can be recovered from the printed text, center on the relation of authorial manuscripts to prompt-books. Although both Massinger's manuscript and the prompt-book may be assumed to have undergone some form of alteration in the process of typesetting and of re-inscription, 9 their common features offer trustworthy evidence about what they were like in the originals, and the causes for significant variation can usually be assigned. The MS is divided into acts only, scenes not being numbered, whereas the Folio breaks up the same acts into numbered scenes. Two and perhaps three errors in F's numbering appear. The first scene of Act I consists of 61 lines of dialogue between a Merchant and Herman. After the first half of line 61 the Merchant's exit is marked, but no exit (as is present in MS) is given for Herman after his concluding half-line although it is clear that he must leave the stage and that a change of place occurs between the first scene and the second that follows between Woolfort and Hubert. At any rate F marks no new scene here, and when the third scene comes along, it is Scœna Secunda . This third scene ends the act so that no further opportunity for misnumbering was offered. In II.iii.184 there is a general exeunt marked and a clear stage but the Folio does not mark a new scene when Florez and Hemskirk (who have just before made separate exits) return to arrange for their duel. A change of place is necessary, and indeed the exits of both of the principals had prepared for a change on their re-entrance, for otherwise they could have remained behind for their discussion after the general exeunt. The third case is less certain. In Act III a clear stage occurs after III.iii.13 when Hubert exits following the announcement of his plan to disguise himself as a huntsman. The beggars then enter to sit in justice on the captured boors and Hemskirk. The scene is the wood but not necessarily the same place, and indeed since Hubert enters to them at line 77 the most natural implication would be that he has found them in another part of the wood. However, no doubt this is an over-scrupulous view for Elizabethan staging, and thus despite the clear stage a numbered scene iv is not quite certain. On the other hand, the case seems a little more definite when after IV.iv.74 Hubert and Hemskirk exit to clear the stage but no scene number is given in the Folio before the entrance of Gerrard and the beggars, and, later, of Hubert. The later entrance of Hubert suggests a change of scene since he could have stayed behind to meet the beggars after Hemskirk's exit if the scene had remained continuous. For Believe as You List in 1631, conjecturally eighteen years later than his manuscript of Beggars Bush , Massinger wrote out the scene numbers, which Knight then deleted when he made the manuscript into a prompt-book. It is also significant, perhaps, that in Knight's manuscript of The Honest Mans Fortune in 1624 scene numbers are not present. The lack of scene numbers is not unexpected in MS, therefore, and of itself offers no evidence about the condition of Massinger's copy. It is possible, however, that this evidence is in fact contained in the Folio. At the end of I.ii, since only the Merchant was given an exit and an exit was not marked for Herman after his concluding half line, Compositor B, if he were himself numbering the scenes, could readily have been misled into thinking that the scene continued and the stage was not clear. 10 Similarly, at IV.iv.76 an error appears where Hubert's parting remark to Hemskirk has an exit instead of exeunt placed after it. It may be that Compositor A was misled by the faulty direction he had just set (no doubt from an abbreviation such as is found here in MS) into thinking that the stage was not clear and that the scene continued. On the other hand, given the order of setting the Folio pages as $2 v :3, $2:3 v , $1 v :4, and $1:4 v it is obvious that no compositor could in fact number the scenes as a part of his typesetting. As an illustration, Compositor B would have set ' Scœna Secunda .' for I.iii on sig. Kk2 v before he had any idea whether there was or was not a scene division on Kk2. Thus if the omission of the numbering of I.ii and IV.v (and very likely of II.iv and III.iv) occurred in the printing shop in an attempt to number the scenes of an unnumbered manuscript, the blame must be laid on someone who went through the manuscript marking the scenes for the compositors but making four mistakes, two of which can be laid to faults or ambiguities in the directions of the copy. This seems to be the conclusion to which the evidence leads. 11 The survival of authorial stage-directions in the transcript of a prompt-book is always interesting. In F the Massingerean directions are brief and business-like entrances and exits, with very few descriptive features, and so are those of MS: the scribe of the prompt-book seems to have copied directions verbatim from Massinger's manuscript. Thus whenever the text as in F expands a simple entrance or exit, the MS repeats, even in such a permissive direction as III.i.o.1, ' Enter three or foure Boores '; 12 other examples are ' Enter Higgen like a Sowgelder, singing ' (II.i.3.1), ' Enter Gerrard like a blinde Aquavitœ-man, and a boy singing the Song ' (III.i.96.1), 13 ' Enter Hubert like a Huntesman ' (III.iii.o.1), ' Enter Higgen . . . and the rest with Boores (III.iv. 0.1), 14 ' Enter with a drum Van-donck, Merchants, Higgen, Prig, Ferret, Snap ' (V.ii.130.1), or ' Exeunt all but Beggars ' (V.ii.130.1). In such directions the only difference between F and MS is that F may add articles or connectives that were usually wanting in the copy, such as ' and ' in I.iii.62.1 and IV.vi.12.1; ' with ' at V.ii.109; and ' a ' at V.ii.130.1, although sometimes it is the opposite. With only one exception (V.ii. 64) where the order of two names in a group is reversed, MS repeats the exact order of the names as found in F. Some differences in directions may be laid to the account either of the F compositors or the MS scribe. At II.i.142.1 where F reads '—— strike ', MS has the full direction, which is necessary, ' Strike musick .' MS ' and Piper ' seems to have been added in the prompt-book to Higgen's entrance at III.i.3.1, although an F omission is not impossible. The direction is correct, for the piper is addressed in line 17. At V.i.70.1 F omits Bertha's entrance, presumably from oversight. The MS also has a few errors where F is correct, these, probably, to be attributed to the scribe and not to copy. An example comes at IV.vi.12.1 where for F ' Enter Vanlock and Francis ' MS reads, ' Enter Vand: M rs Fran: ', but in the next line the MS speech-prefix is correctly ' Vanlok .' and it would seem only that the scribe was misled on this first appearance of a new character whose name began with Van . At IV.vi.63 where F reads ' Ser. within. ' as a speech-prefix, the MS omission of ' within ' could be a scribal or a prompt-book error although no entrance and exit are provided for the servant before he brings the called-for cloak at line 97.1 (this latter direction is omitted in MS). At IV.vi.69 whether the MS direction accurately reflects the prompt-book or is a result of the scribe's condensation (the only known case) is difficult to determine. The Folio reads ' Enter Bertha. Van-donck , and the rest Merchants '. This looks as though Massinger's copy had added ' Merchants ' to give a precision to the general phrase ' the rest ' in the foul papers on which it was presumably drawing. Oddly, MS reads ' Enter: Bertha: Vandunck &amp;c '. Such vagueness seems odd in a prompt-book, especially when its copy had been reasonably precise, and it may not have been the original: in MS the direction, though on a separate line, was started to the right, and the ' &amp;c ' hits the right margin. Hence it is possible that the scribe used this device instead of copying a second line of direction once he had begun his inscription with too little space. The MS omission of ' againe ' from F's ' Holla againe ' (V.i.82) may be the prompt's condensation since it was superfluous. As expected, the Lambarde MS directions contain various additions to Massinger's fair copy as preserved in the Folio. It is more than possible, also, that not all of the prompt-book's additions have been retained in MS, since some slight evidence exists that the scribe passed over a few directions that could have appeared in the margins outside the text, like the omission of F's exit for Margaret at II.iii.43 or the final exit for the scene at III.v.48 and again at IV.i.73. 15 At I.ii.o.1 MS adds Hemskirk to the entrance direction. Some guard for Hubert is manifestly required, and—though mute—Hemskirk is the natural agent for Woolfort to have used to intercept Hubert's flight, although for all we know Massinger may have intended no more than the usual supernumerary guards. The F omission of the direction for Bertha's entrance in V.i.70.1 may be an F error and not a prompt addition preserved in the Lambarde MS, but sometimes authors' papers are not impeccable in their entrances, although this missing one is egregious. All the other additions are concerned with properties. In the margin to the left of the opening direction for II.iii, MS adds ' Table out: '. As part of the centered opening direction for III.i MS adds after the entrance, ' A table kans, and stooles sett out '. Before Higgen's entrance at III.i.3 MS reads to the left, ' Winde a Sowgelders horn within '. At III.iv.97.1 where F had read ' Enter Ferret. a letter .', MS has ' Enter Ferrett: with y e Paper '. At IV.iii.14 MS adds to the right, braced, ' Drum, flourish | Peeces discharg | Enter saylors '. 16 At IV.v.29 to F's ' Enter Hubert ' MS adds the property warning ' a letter ', the paper being used at line 39. At IV.vi.o.1 MS adds ' severallie ' to F's ' Enter two young Merchants .' Somewhat superfluously, MS changes F ' Enter Woolfort, Hemskirke, and Attendants ' (V.i.51.1) to ' Enter Woolfort: Hemskirk, Guard and Attendants :' in a direction where Massinger had seemingly thought of the attendants as comprising the guard. The MS addition '( Hubert hollowes within )' wanting in F at V.i.44.1 may just possibly be evidence for an F error of omission, for this holla is mentioned in line 82 when F reads ' Holla againe .' A few prompt directions may perhaps be recovered from the 1679 Folio, which has clearly been compared with a theatrical copy and changes noted in the 1647 text used by the 1679 printer. For example, at II.iii.137.1 where neither 1647 nor MS has a direction, 1679 specifies ' He gets Hemskirks sword and cuts him on the head .' This specification of the kind of wound, or even that Hemskirk is wounded at all, could not have been drawn from the context. That this may not be a sophistication in 1679 but an omission by the MS scribe may be suggested because MS has a dash after the line which it should follow, this dash being customary in MS to separate the text from a direction written to the right on the same line. Thus it would appear that this is one of the marginal directions omitted by the MS scribe even though he copied the dash. A few lines before, at line 135, the 1679 direction ' Strikes him .'—though obvious from the context—is also very likely a prompt-book addition wanting in F (and MS) since in MS the text-line here is also followed by a telltale dash. On the other hand, at III.iv.36 the 1679 addition ' Beat one another .' wanting in F and MS may not necessarily have come from the prompt-book since the context would provide the direction and there is no dash in MS. A clearcut theatrical direction appears in the MS variant from 1647, where the F direction at IV.i.40.1 ' Enter Higgen. and Prig. like Porter [ s ]' is changed in MS to ' Enter Higg: and Prig like Boores ', this no doubt on the principle of economy, or precision, since disguise as boors is required for them later at V.i.98.1. But the prompt-book seems to have omitted on several occasions to specify necessary action beyond Massinger's incomplete or ambiguous directions as found in F. The prompt-book acceptance of Massinger's ' Enter three or foure Boores ' at III.i.o.1 has been noticed above. More to the point, at III.ii. 32 MS follows the F form of the direction, ' Enter Gerrard and Beggars. ', without specifying that in fact they have doffed their disguises as beggars and adopted some other, for Florez does not recognize them (lines 39-41). Moreover, when at line 49.1 Gerrard returns after reassuming his disguise as Clause, no mention in either is made of this necessary change back to his customary appearance. Correspondingly, although at IV.i.40.1 the prompt-book had altered Massinger's disguise of Higgen and Prig from porters to boors, when they participate in IV.iii in the general entrance direction no disguise is specified in F or in MS, yet they must be in the same habits as in IV.i. More important is the manner in which the prompt-book does not seem to have inserted a direction that was wanting in Massinger at V.i.55 when Woolfort orders his soldiers to search out the woman to whom the Boor had been calling. Nor is the deficiency repaired when Bertha's entrance at line 70.1 (missing in F) is added marginally —probably by Knight—merely as ' Enter: Bertha ', for according to line 55 she should be brought in by the soldiers who made their exit at line 55. This appears to be a clear case of Knight's failing to make good the inadequacies of the author's copy for staging. (The soldiers are later mentioned at V.ii.64, but there they are part of the F direction as well.) Another omission in the prompt-book caused by Knight's failure to annotate his copy occurs at III.iv.42 where the simple direction ' Enter Hemskirck .' lacks the necessary addition that he was brought in by guards. More careless was the important failure to add Hemskirk, who was missing in Massinger's copy (and who should have had an exit at line 65), to the group entrance at V.ii.109 although it is clear that he musters in the captives at this point. At II.iii.164 both texts omit Bertha from the exit given Florez. These are simple omissions caused by failure to annotate the author's copy properly in making up the prompt-book. On another occasion Knight carelessly followed his copy in reproducing positive error. In both F and MS Jacqueline is named in the general entrance at II.i.o.1 although she does not actually make her entrance until line 171. However, at 171 the true entrance is noted in both and so no harm is done, even though it was careless to leave her name standing after the right action had been observed. The most serious error of all was not caused by Knight following his deficient copy but instead by his misinterpreting the staging intended by Massinger though not specified owing to the omission of a crucial stage-direction. In IV.vi Gerrard (as Clause) orders Florez (as Goswin) to redeem his pledge and to leave his bride and the wedding to follow him. Florez' pleas are ignored until finally Gerrard tells him (lines 94-95), 'Then you must goe with me: I can stay no longer. | If ye be true, and noble——'. Both the broken-off speech (actually punctuated in F with a period but in MS with a colon) and Florez' reply, 'Hard heart, I'le follow:' indicate that Gerrard must make his exit here at line 95, but neither document has a direction. Florez then turns to address the guests, urging them to return inside the house and celebrate until his return, and in lines 100-101 he urges the host Van-dunk (though not by name), 'nay pray goe in Sir, | And take them with you, tis but a night lost Gentelmen.' Van-dunk responds by urging the guests to enter the house and promising them 'he cannot stay long from her | I am sure of that', to which Florez, completing line 104, responds, 'I will not stay; beleeve Sir.' Then in line 105 Florez turns to say farewell to Bertha before making his exit at line 107. In F (and almost demonstrably in Massinger's copy) the simple word ' Exit. ' is misplaced to follow Florez' 'I will not stay; beleeve Sir.' in line 104 (on the same line) instead of after line 103 to indicate the exit of Van-dunk and the wedding guests. The combination of the missing exit for Gerrard after line 95 and the misplaced exit in 104 in Massinger's manuscript, caused Knight to retain the faulty position and to take it that 'I will not stay; beleeve Sir' had been addressed to Gerrard; hence he amplified the copy ' Exit. ' by altering it to the form found in MS in the same position, ' Ex t . Gerr: '. This is a real error since Massinger's intended staging is quite obvious. 17 As in the above example, Massinger was by no means scrupulous in marking all necessary exits, and (again as in the above example) Knight in writing out the prompt-book did not himself provide very many of the missing exit directions. Thus both F and MS join in failing to note the exits that are required at I.ii.23; II.i.142, 187, 196, 208; III.ii.34; III.iv.40; V.i.150; V.ii.67; and V.ii.255.1, these in addition to the ones already mentioned. Exit directions missing in F are found in MS at II.ii.17 and IV.iii.40, whether added by Knight or omitted in printing F is not to be determined. The exits found in F but omitted in MS at II.iii.43, III.i.96, III.v.48, and IV.i.73 may be errors by the MS scribe. The condition of Massinger's manuscript from which F was set and the prompt-book transcribed is a matter of some interest because comparison of the two documents enables one to recover certain unusual features of this manuscript that offer useful evidence for determining the causes of anomalies in other printed dramatic texts. At least two additions were made to Massinger's papers after he had inscribed them. The first of these occurs at III.iv.130 and concerns the position of Higgen's canting speech to Hubert. In the Lambarde MS all is in order. The disguised Hubert makes his offer to serve the beggars and is accepted by Gerrard (lines 119-120), who orders the beggars to welcome him. Higgen takes the duty upon himself, greets Hubert, and then at line 130 is told by Gerrard, 'Now sweare him', after which appears the canting oath (lines 131-143), 18 ending 'Y'are wellcome Brother' (line 144). In F, on the other hand, Gerrard's 'Now sweare him' is followed by line 144 'You are welcom Brother', after which comes the dialogue of lines 145-157 including Hemskirk's being placed in Hubert's charge. Immediately after the part-line 157 (Hubert's 'And ye play tricks with me') occurs repeated line 130 'Now sweare him', followed by the oath, after which the text picks up again with the second half of line 157 (Gerrard's 'So, now come in'). Two points are of concern: first, material of a special interest—the canting oath—is misplaced in F; second, the misplaced oath is prefaced by the cue-line of the text, repeated, Gerrard's 'Now sweare him.' What seems to have happened is that the oath, an addition, was written on a separate piece of paper with the cue-line ' Gerrard . Now sweare him' prefixed as a key to its placement, but the position was mistaken by the F compositor. It is worth notice that the 1679 Folio, set from 1647 but with some reference to theatrical copy, places the oath correctly as in MS. The second case is more difficult to assess. In MS at V.i.70.1 Bertha makes her entrance, is captured, and after Hemskirk and Woolfort have congratulated themselves on discovering her, Hubert hollos within as he approaches for the meeting. At this point in MS Bertha speaks three lines (lines 84-86): Ber : O I am miserablie lost, thus faln into myne uncles hands from all my hopes can I not thinke away my selfe, and die? after which Hubert enters with the disguised beggars. In F, on the other hand, the three lines of speech (84-86) are followed by a repetition of the first two lines with different spelling: Ber . O I am miserably lost, thus falne Into my uncles hands from all my hopes, Can I not thinke away my selfe and dye? O I am miserably lost; thus fallen Into my Uncles hands, from all my hopes: Then comes a continuation of her lamenting speech for twelve lines (86-97), absent in MS, before she concludes with a repetition of the third line of the MS speech, Can I not thinke away my selfe and dye? after which Hubert and the beggars enter. Once again the repetition of what appear to be the lines that key the speech in its proper place indicates that Bertha's brief three lines in Massinger's original manuscript were expanded by a dozen additional ones written on a separate sheet of paper with the cue. In this case, however, whether by accident or design, the prompt-book omitted these lines (followed again by 1679 in its treatment). Whether Knight overlooked the separate piece of paper on which they were written, or whether he rejected the expansion of the speech is not to be demonstrated. The point is that the omission of these lines in MS is not a theatrical cut of original material but either a cut or an error in treating an added passage. Another difference between the two texts comes at III.i.42, where in F the MS song about the devil is omitted although the lines leading to it are preserved: Hig . Will you heare a Song how the Divel was gelded? 3. Bo . I, I, lets heare the Divell roare, Sow-gelder. These lines are followed not by the song but by the resumption of the dialogue after it at line 60. Although there is some possibility that the indecency of the song led to its omission in the printing of F, the use in MS of an Italian hand for the song, as for the added canting oath, could suggest the contrary possibility—even though slight—that the play's songs were all inserted in the Massinger papers, written on separate sheets, the sheet for the devil-gelding song having been lost after transcription into the prompt-book. 19 If Knight had annotated Massinger's fair copy in preparation for writing the prompt-book, and if the Folio printer had set these annotations, we should be completely unable to identify such markings, for F and MS would agree. Nevertheless, the various changes that Knight made in his transcription, and particularly their kind, seem to indicate that in preparation for this transcript he may have read over the play to familiarize himself with it, but he did not mark it. One piece of excellent evidence comes in the two changes that Knight introduced into the time-scheme. In the original papers, as demonstrated by the text of F, the Merchant, who in I.i receives the necessary exposition of the antecedent action from Herman, had been absent for five years (I.i.7), during which time Woolfort's revolt had taken place followed by the flight of Gerrard bearing with him the young heir Florez. This time scheme was obviously absurd, since it allowed far too short an interval for Florez to be placed as a young child in England with Goswin, to become a man, and then to establish himself as a merchant in Bruges. Knight here altered 'five yeares absence' to ten years, as found in MS. The revision makes Florez' memory of his childhood in Flanders conveniently short, but no more than dramatic license permits, perhaps. Knight then made a consequential change in I.iii.140 that altered the period of Florez' charity to Clause from F three to MS seven years. This revision was by no means so strictly necessary and in one sense was really ill-advised since if Florez had been a merchant for seven years in Bruges he could have spent only three years in England, a complete impossibility. The virtue of the change as Knight saw it, perhaps, was to provide a longer time for the beggars to have amassed the huge sum with which they rescue Florez; but the new interval scarcely fits into Florez' personal history. The Folio omits almost nothing from the MS text. The loss of Higgen's half-line 'I thanke your worshipps' at III.i.65 is certainly accidental. The omission at III.i.19 of 'Shees vengeance ranck o'th man' in F, coming after 'Canst thou tell me a way now, how to cut off my wives Concupiscence?' is uncertain whether simply the dropping of the last line of a speech by accident or else an act of censorship. No very serious formal censorship of oaths is evident in either text, both of which join without variation in the usual quotas of by the mass , slid , and faith . On the other hand, at III.i.131 and 132 F prints dashes to substitute for some indecency in the speech of the Second Boor. It seems possible that these dashes are not independent F censorship but instead the representation of dashes found in Massinger's manuscript, as indicated by the mildness of the MS substitutes, which in the first instance has 'Plague' and in the second, 'Pox'. Since one cannot imagine anybody deleting plague , or possibly pox , by a dash, it is reasonable to conjecture that Knight added what he thought was acceptable for the dashes he found in Massinger's papers. If so, it is likely that Massinger substituted the dashes for some indecency he found in Fletcher's original text. When F has Hubert harangue Woolfort as 'A Prince, in nothing but your princely lusts' where MS has 'beastlie lusts', censorship may have operated although compositorial memorial contamination is as possible as compositorial censorship. Only one other possible case of censorship occurs—this in MS—where the line 'No . . . impositions, taxes, grievances' (II.i.105) is omitted. This line might be taken as reflecting on the king; but another explanation for its omission is possible (see below). In contrast to F, MS omits a number of lines. Various of these are cases of eyeskip, presumably by the MS scribe, such as the omission of 'to beleeve . . . dangerous' at I.ii.57-58, the half-line 'he . . . purveyers' (II.i.120), and the last line of two speeches (II.iii.18, IV.vi.72), 'It is not . . . from' (V.ii.89), and 'I speake . . . Hemskirck ' (V.ii.133). Knight seems to have started by cutting what he considered to be repetitious parts of speeches. For instance, at I.ii.11-17 he may have felt that the sentiments in 'Who ever . . . prayers with' did not need the elaboration given them and removed the text as found in F. Similarly, later in the same scene he cut 'Despise them not . . . actions' in F I.ii. 108-114 perhaps because he found the hypocrisy was too blatant for Hubert to have swallowed. These are the only clearcut examples of Knight's editing by deletion, and it would seem that he soon gave up his initial intention to tighten the dialogue by excisions. Two other cases seem to represent Knight's omissions but for other reasons. The first is the omission of the single line 'No . . . grievances' mentioned above as a possible case of censorship. However, if F's reading 'On', which needs emendation to 'No', stood in Massinger's copy by mistake, it may have been that Knight simply omitted the line when he could make no sense of it. This is the more possible as an explanation, because something of the same sort seems to have occurred at IV.vi.9-12 in the omission in MS of ' 1. Merchant . No doubt on't . . . Vanlock .' Here there was no reason to delete these lines, which in fact are useful to introduce a new character just making his entrance. However, signs of textual disruption in F suggest that Massinger's copy was not clear to Knight. F omits the speech-prefix ' 2. Merchant .' present in MS for the first half of line 9 and prints as a separate line without speech-prefix what should have been the 1. Merchant's response (cut in MS) which started by completing line 9, followed by the remaining lines of the response. This double omission of speech-prefixes in F, connected with a passage omitted from MS, suggests a simple cut when Knight could not reconcile the text with the single prefix that was perhaps the only one present in his copy. The third example at IV.i.29-32 consisting of Florez' entire speech 'Is my misery . . . reproaches?' appears to have no reason behind its omission from MS. It usefully comes between two speeches to him by the Merchants and is not repetitious. That it was deliberately cut by Knight for such reasons as had moved him to cut in I.ii is difficult to believe. Whether there was some unknown form of textual disruption that caused him to omit it, or whether it was left out by mistake either by Knight or the scribe of MS is not to be known. This account of Knight's small attention to questions of text with especial reference to shortening the play, suggests that he omitted Bertha's expanded speech in V.i.86-97 more because he did not have the separate sheet of paper on which it was written than because he cut the passage. However, the case is uncertain. The Folio speech-prefixes seem generally accurate. The difficulty due to copy in IV.vi.8-12 causing the F omission of two prefixes has been noticed above. Possibly indicative of some uncertainty on Massinger's part about this scene is the mistaken F prefix for 3. Merchant a few lines later at IV.vi.17, which conflicts with the opening entrance direction specifying two Merchants and which is thus corrected by Knight (if it stood in Massinger's papers) to 2. Merchant . At II.i.194 F's assignment of the first stuttering speech to Higgen may just possibly be right if he immediately exits, for it would then be the change from his normal speech to the stutter that provoked Hubert's 'Slid they did all speak plain ev'n now me thought'. But since after this remark he addresses Snap, continuing, 'Do'st thou know this same Maid?', the MS assignment of line 194 to Snap , the only known stutterer, is very likely correct, and Hubert's wonder at the stuttering is natural enough if Snap answers. The correctness of F is not certain in several more cases of doubt. At III.i.95,96 a pair of related variants appears, suggesting in itself more Knight's intervention than F's error, although the compositor may have overlooked the manuscript prefixes in this series of short speeches. At any rate, whether all the boors chorus in lines 94-95 'I take it, take it, | And take some drinke too', or whether it is the second boor who adds 'And take some drinke too' as in MS, is uncertain. It is correspondingly uncertain whether in lines 95-96 it is Prig who has the whole speech in response 'Not a drop now | I thanke you; away, we are discover'd else', the latter an aside to Higgen, or whether as in MS it is Prig who answers the boor and Higgen who speaks the closing half-line to Prig as an aside. One would be inclined to rely on the aptness of the MS ascriptions and to treat the F assignments as oversights (difficult as double error may be here) were it not for a single clearcut case of Knight's sophistication of the text, encouraging a hypothesis for his intervention here. This sophistication comes in an entrance direction at V.ii.109.1 in F, which follows Gerrard's 'Insolent Devill!' addressed to Woolfort: the entrance is moved up a line so that Costin, who would be otherwise mute in this scene (and in the play), is given the ejaculation as his entrance line that should obviously be assigned to Gerrard. An earlier difference in speech-prefixes in this scene, the omission of Florez' prefix before 'Is this that Traitor Woolfort ?' in line 84, seems to be a simple error in MS, not an attempt to assign Florez' line to the previous speaker Gerrard. In other differences, MS is pretty clearly wrong. In III.iv.5-6 the error involves giving Prig the last line of Higgen's speech by raising his prefix one line, doubtless a mechanical error perhaps by the MS scribe. At III.i.16 F's 1. B. is correct and MS 3. Boor in error as shown by the context before and the song. It is unlikely at III.i.68 that MS 1. 2. 3. Boors for F 1. 2. B. is correct, for all other choruses from the three are prefixed by All Boors . The omission of Higgen's prefix at III.iv.39 in MS is a simple error, whether Knight's or the scribe's, apparently caused by confusion between his speech beginning 'Brother' and Prig's preceding 'A shrew'd point Brother' as if 'Brother' had been repeated by the same speaker. With the exception of the deliberate alteration in the position of the entrance direction at V.ii.109.1 already noted in order to transfer Gerrard's line to Costin, there is no indication that Knight altered the position of Massinger's directions. However, the varying treatment given entrance directions by the MS scribe, sometimes centering them in a large hand, and at other times squeezing them in on a text line, indicates that as in Believe as You List Knight had placed some of Massinger's centered directions in the margin. The position the MS scribe chose for them gives no indication that Knight had made them at all anticipatory. When one comes to review what can be learned from this example of a prompt-book and its copy (insofar as they can each be reconstructed from documents at one remove), the first point of interest is that Knight in fact wrote out a prompt-book from papers that on the evidence should have been Massinger's fair copy of a play by himself and two other men. That is, although there is no indication that the manuscript of Beggars Bush could not have been as clean as that for Massinger's Believe as You List , Knight treated the two differently. The suggestion may follow that Believe as You List represents an unusual case and that the normal theatrical procedure was to use an author's fair copy as the basis for the transcript of a prompt-book, not to mark it so that it became the prompt-book itself. 20 Whether the company had criticized Massinger's play and made suggestions that resulted in authorial revision before the original earlier prompt-book was transcribed is unlikely, on the evidence, although it is true that any revisions marked in the papers would have been repeated both in the Folio and in Knight's later prompt-book and thus in MS. The two additions—the canting oath at III.iv.131-143 and the expansion of Bertha's lament at V.i.86-97—identify themselves because of the cue-lines to key them into the text after they had been written on separate sheets of paper, these cue-lines being repeated in F as if an integral part of the text. Both of these passages are additions, therefore, but whether they can be called later revisions is perhaps moot. For the first, Gerrard's 'Now-sweare him' is the cue, but this text line would seem to call for some oath not found in the text proper without the addition. This situation suggests that when III.iv was written, the oath—which required more canting language than Fletcher may have had at his command—was proposed but needed to be worked out and inserted at a later time, whether written by Fletcher or by someone else is not to be proved. Thus the oath seems a special case, prepared for in the text but temporarily passed over. Whether the same is true for Bertha's speech is less obvious, for her rhetoric would have needed no special preparation as did the canting oath. A dozen lines is an insufficient number on which to judge authorship. The passage occurs in a scene written by Massinger and is presumably his; he would scarcely have needed outside help to compose it. Hence Bertha's added lines may represent an authentic revision, but whether called for by the company to fatten Bertha's small part is difficult to say. If it was, ironically the addition was omitted from Knight's prompt-book by accident. If the addition was Massinger's own idea, then a slight chance exists that Knight cut it, although omission by accident is still the more probable conjecture. These two alterations, then, do not necessarily originate with the company; other differences between the two texts are too slight to assign to authorial revision. It would seem that Knight was ordered to make up the prompt-book from Massinger's papers as they stood but with whatever changes his professional judgment might suggest. It is reasonably clear that if Knight read over Massinger's papers, he did not make notes about problems of casting and staging presented by the author's stage-directions before setting to work. This is the odder in that Massinger's directions for entrances, especially, and often for exits were sometimes non-existent and, as it happened, confused Knight who took less account of the context than he should have when he followed Massinger's errors of omission. A few errors of commission, also, could have been corrected by a careful consideration of the context but were, instead, slavishly copied. In fact, Knight made a minimum effort to exercise his personal judgment in straightening out various of the tangles in the directions and the action and was generally content to copy what he found with the addition only of directions for properties and noises. The question of cuts made in prompt-books is an important one, but Beggars Bush is uninformative. The omission of a few single lines in MS appears to be accidental either in copying the prompt-book or the Lambarde transcript deriving from it. One omission of Florez' brief speech in IV.i.29-32 is inexplicable and may be accidental, and two other omissions seem to have been caused by Knight's inability to resolve textual difficulties, a problem he solved by draconian methods (II.i.105, IV.vi.9-12). Two brief cuts of repetitious sentiment he seems to have initiated on his own responsibility early in the play (I.ii.11-17, 108-114), but no more. So far as one can tell, he decided on these omissions while he was copying the papers, although in theory they could have been crossed out later. It is interesting that he made little or no attempt to reline faulty verse in the manuscript where Massinger seems to have written a beginning half-line as part of the following pentameter. A round dozen of such lines are faithfully reproduced both in F and in MS, thus suggesting that mislineation, at least of this sort, is no guide to the nature of the manuscript underlying printed copy. Indeed, MS's lineation is less correct on occasion than F, but whether this difference is caused by the F compositors improving their copy or by the MS scribe (or Knight) running two half-lines together is unknowable. Knight seems to have accepted almost all of Massinger's directions, permissive or descriptive, only rarely making minor alterations when properties were to be specified, as changing Massinger's ' a letter ' to ' y e paper ', or once where precision of disguise was needed, as in his alteration of Higgen's and Prig's disguise from porters to boors (IV.i. 40.1), or his distinction between Woolfort's attendants by the addition of ' Guards ' (V.i.51.1). Although he was careful to specify properties and noises, he did little to work out the staging. If the addition of ' severallie ' was his at IV.vi.0.1, he did direct the two Merchants to enter by different doors, however. It is probable that the added 1679 direction for the wounding of Hemskirk at II.iii.137.1 was Knight's interpretation of an action not clear from the text. At I.ii.0.1 he usefully introduced Hemskirk to the scene as a mute, but it is possible that he was thinking in terms of saving an actor by omitting the direction for the entrance of a servant with Florez' cloak at IV.vi.97.1 as found in F. On the other hand, his lack of imagination in interpreting the intentions of the text and providing for entrances and exits that Massinger had carelessly omitted must have led to a staging quite the opposite of what was really envisaged. Typical cases are the failure at V.ii.65 to add an exit for Hemskirk and thus to bring him back on stage with the captives at line 109, similar to the failure to provide for the guards' exit at V.i.55 and thus their absence accompanying Bertha's entrance at line 70.1. The lack of care to specify necessary disguises at III.ii.32,49.1 contrasts with the specification at IV.i.40.1. One wonders whether in the staging the beggars were indeed disguised at III.ii.32. The common failure to mark ordinary and expectable exits wanting in Massinger's papers shows that scrupulous attention to exit directions is no absolute criterion for prompt-copy. Exact directions for the staging of a scene such as the drifting off of the beggars about II.i.194 are not inserted and the situation is left as vague as in the copy. In short, if a printing shop had set copy from Knight's prompt-book or the Lambarde transcript of it had omitted the marginal directions for properties, no clue that prompt-copy had been the source could have been perceived from the print, and such matters as the false entrance of Jacqueline at II.i.0.1 would have been avouched as evidence for authorial papers. Moreover, except for one sophistication Knight seems to have retained the ordinary positions for entrance as in his copy and not to have advanced them in an anticipatory manner. The speech-prefixes in MS are sometimes more correct than they seem to have been in Massinger's papers, where it is possible that remnants of a change of mind are present, as in the use of Higgen as a prefix where MS Snap seems called for at II.i.194, or F. 3. Merchant at IV.vi.17 which Knight changed to 2. Merchant . The prefixes found in III.i.95,96 may or may not be Knight's additions. Errors in MS of course could derive from the scribe: one cannot positively assign them to Knight except for V.ii.109. That Knight did not carefully consider the action and so failed to insert a few necessary entrances may be matched by two particular sins of commission. First, his mistake about Gerrard's exit at IV.vi.95 not marked in copy led him to give Gerrard the exit at line 104 which Massinger had intended for Van-dunk and the wedding guests, an error that would have been difficult to assign to prompt-book origin if reproduced in print. Second, faced with a brand-new character, Costin, at V.ii.109.1, he deliberately tampered with a line by Gerrard to give this newcomer his one speech of the play and altered the position of the entrance direction in order to accommodate the change. When a Shakespearean textual critic finds copy other than a prompt-book behind the printed text, as in All's Well That Ends Well , or Twelfth Night , or Julius Caesar , he may legitimately wonder whether when the prompt-book came to be written the scribe really resolved the various contradictions in time-schemes, or references to action that never took place (both of which appear in the false report of Helena's death by Lord G), or changes of intention not removed from the text (such as the substitution of Fabian for Feste in the letter-gulling scene with Malvolio), or alternatives for the staging of scenes such as are found in Helena's choice of Bertram or, in Julius Caesar , in the interview of Brutus and Cassius in Act IV. In short, loose ends that were not tied up in copy were perpetuated in Knight's prompt-book since he made only a feeble effort to correct them. It would be interesting to know whether his alterations in the time scheme in I.i.7 and I.iii.140 were made at the moment of copying, like his two cuts in I.ii, or later when he may have become conscious of the difficulties involved. Something could be said for his having made the first change on the spot when he became conscious of the absurd identification in Massinger's text of a Merchant who had been absent from Flanders for five years (line 7) with one who had left Flanders before the start of a seven years' war recently concluded (line 12). If so, Knight would have been better advised to have contented himself with changing the five to ten years and not to have altered the mention of Florez' charity to Clause at I.iii.140 from three to seven years. If the alteration had been made under the influence of Bertha's seven-year residence with Van-dunk, then Knight must have reverted to it; otherwise it could have been done currently if he knew enough about the plot to recognize that three years was a short time to accumulate the treasure with which the beggars later rescue Florez. Whenever the alterations were made, the time scheme is still grossly impossible, and Knight never grappled with its intricacies. It is true that references in the text to the duration of the antecedent action could have been adjusted with relative satisfaction if Knight had troubled to work out the necessary schedule. On the other hand, perhaps nothing could have been done about the extraordinary confusion in the timing of the action presented on the stage. In I.i the Merchant leaves Flanders for Bruges and arrives in I.iii. In I.ii Hubert and Hemskirk also leave but do not arrive until II.iii. In the interval Florez has engaged his credit to huge purchases in I.iii, is given six months to pay, and provides Clause with his daily alms. On the very next day, in II.i he chooses Clause as king of the beggars and Hubert and Hemskirk arrive outside Bruges. II.ii shows Florez, months later, apparently, depressed at the contrary winds that keep his ships from port as the day for payment approaches. In the next scene II.iii Hubert and Hemskirk arrive at Van-dunk's house in Bruges. II.iv follows immediately on II.iii, and III.i comes the same day when Hemskirk recruits the boors. In III.ii Florez is talking of bankruptcy in the vein of II.ii and has only one day left of his six months; nevertheless in this scene he is attacked by the boors whom Hemskirk had hired the very day of his arrival. In III.iii Hubert meets the beggars on the same day as III.ii although it is evident that this is the same day as the arrival in Bruges and the meeting in Van-dunk's house. Thus Hubert and Hemskirk are on one time schedule, which is the logical one, and Florez with his six months' bond is on another. II.iii, II.iv, III.i, III.iii, and III.iv are roughly contemporaneous with I.iii and II.i. But intercalated II.ii and III.ii (mixed) are six months later. The two time schemes join very abruptly in III.ii when Gerrard (as Clause) returns after the rescue of Florez which had taken place according to the time scheme of III.i and is informed of his next day's bankruptcy according to the schedule of II.ii and the start of III.ii. Very likely there was nothing that Knight could have done about this complete mixup; the schedule had been carelessly planned in the synopsis of the action divided among the three different dramatists of Acts I, II, and III, and the case was about hopeless without major surgery. If the company—and no doubt the audience—was not much concerned about this double time scheme, it would be too much, perhaps, to have expected Knight to have troubled himself about the two different views taken of the four Merchants in I.iii and in II.ii and later in their attitude to Florez. However, since it was a question of who had to be brought on the stage and when (and the correct writing-out of the 'plot' for backstage consultation) he was careless in not recognizing that in II.i the direction (which he reproduced) for the entrance of six beggars, Higgen, Ferret, Prig, Clause, Snap, and Ginks, was inaccurate in its permissive conclusion ' and other Beggars '. From Higgen's count in lines 57-58, 'we are seven of us, | Like to the seven wise Masters, or the Planets', it should have been clear that ' the rest of the Beggars ' did not comprise various supernumeraries (never mentioned elsewhere) but some one missing and unmentioned beggar needed to make up the seven. It may have been the copy error including Jaqueline in the entrance that satisfied Knight about the question of seven, although she could scarcely be eligible for the pending election, and he should have noticed her correctly marked entrance later at line 171. At any rate, the prompt-book was never altered to bring in Costin as the seventh beggar here or later. For instance, in III.iv.0.1 it is possible that Knight brought supernumerary beggars on the stage since the direction read ' Enter Higgen, Prig, Ferret, Gynks and the rest ', although properly ' the rest ' comprised the mutes Snap and Costin. In IV.v.0.1 six beggars are named but not Costin. As a result, it is quite possible in the staged play that when Costin made his entrance at V.ii.109.1, after his mention only in V.i.126 as a follower of Gerrard who will be captured, the audience would never have seen him before in his disguise as a beggar. The direction in V.i.98.1 erroneously names Ginks as a disguised boor with Higgen, Prig, Ferret, and Snap. In lines 133-141 Hubert maps the plan for Woolfort to divide his soldiers into five squadrons, four under the guidance of the four boors (line 140) while he himself leads Woolfort and the fifth group to seal off the forest. Thus there are four, not five, boors present, and since in V.ii.109.1 Ginks and Costin enter with Jacqueline as captives and are identified as Lords Arnold and Costin, Ginks (Arnold) could not have been one of the disguised beggars who lead the soldiers into pitfalls and who make their triumphant entrance with Van-dunk. If the prompt-book reflected the actual staging, the company remained serenely unconscious of these various difficulties that they should have noticed in rehearsal. If Knight's transcript of this prompt-book from Massinger's papers is at all typical, it is evident that unresolved tangles in the action and even in the casting could be transferred to print from a prompt-book or transcript. Neglected characters like Costin who ought to have appeared consistently as the seventh beggar, though mute, or characters who have no business being named in directions like Jacqueline in II.i.0.1 and Ginks in V.i.98.1, are not unexpected in an author's working papers but are surprising in prompt-books. Knight's record here as a prompt-book scribe is not a comforting one. We have no information, unfortunately, whether he was the book-keeper of the company this early. He certainly was writing-out the company's prompt-books in 1622, if this is the date for the re-transcription of Beggars Bush , as seems quite possible, and in early 1624 he copied the book for The Honest Mans Fortune . If it is significant that he heads the list of the attendants of the King's Men in Herbert's protection order of December 27,1624, he may well have been the book-keeper then, and earlier at the time Beggars Bush was copied. And if his scribal activities extended as they may well have done, back to his original connection with the King's Men as early as 1616, it would not have been impossible for him to have had a hand in transcripts of one sort or another that were prepared as printer's copy for the Shakespeare First Folio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The investigation of the material in this study was performed in the summer of 1972 with the assistance of a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, which I gratefully acknowledge. 1 Cyrus Hoy, "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (III)," SB , 11 (1958), 87-89, 100. 2 The objections of J. H. Dorenkamp, ed., Fletcher and Massinger: Beggars Bush (Mouton, 1967), pp. 33-37, to the presence of Beaumont are vitiated by his attempts to assign Hoy's Beaumont sections to Massinger, a transfer that can scarcely be defended on stylistic or linguistic evidence. The difficulties with authorial assignments and the problem whether the play was an old one revised by Massinger or a new one written by Massinger, Fletcher, and some unknown are treated in the Textual Introduction to my edition of Beggars Bush in the third volume of the Cambridge University Press edition of The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (1974), from which my act-scene-line references are drawn. 3 Compositor A never set periods. The periods come in the work of Compositor B in the Folio stage-directions after names at II.iii.o.1; III.iv.o.1,97.1; III.v.o.1; IV.i. o.1, where in an extreme case one period and three commas occur. Only the first time at II.iii.o.1 does Compositor B set a period after Enter in the Massinger manner. Since Compositor A set only conventionally punctuated directions, it is a reasonable assumption that more of such directions existed in the underlying printer's copy for the Folio (if indeed they were not there exclusively). 4 Those Nutcracking Elizabethans (1935), p. 194 ff. 5 There can be no dispute about the assignments made to Fletcher and to Massinger, but in the nature of the case we cannot be equally positive that the third hand was Beaumont's. Nevertheless, Dr. Hoy believes that it is, and he does not recognize the linguistic characteristics of the third hand as those of any other known collaborator with Fletcher; thus the odds would seem to favor Beaumont. (For what it is worth, E. H. C. Oliphant argued that Beggars Bush was perhaps a Princess Elizabeth play transferred to the King's Men in 1616: The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher [1927], pp. 257-259). That Massinger made a fair copy of the papers of the other two dramatists for sale to the company is not unusual and has nothing to do with any case for revision versus original authorship: for example, Beaumont seems to have made a fair copy of his own and Fletcher's share of Cupid's Revenge for the company's acceptance. Indeed, the linguistic evidence that Massinger made his fair copy from the other authors' papers, and that he may not even have troubled to copy out Beaumont's share of Act V, does not suggest a revising author in the 1620's working over an earlier play. Until contrary evidence is adduced, it seems relatively safe to take it that Beggars Bush represents a play by Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger, of about 1613, sold to the company at that time in a Massingerean fair copy which was preserved in the theatre and recopied at a later date by Edward Knight into a new prompt-book. 6 These periods for Massinger and colons for Knight may be most conveniently viewed in Massinger's fair copy of Believe as You List with added directions by Knight, reproduced in the Malone Society Reprints (1927). 7 In fact, throughout the two texts the agreement in the use of parentheses is strikingly uniform. 8 The evidence is presented in detail in the third volume of The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon . 9 It is probable, for example, that not all prompt-book markings in the margins have been transcribed by the MS scribe and brought into the text. 10 The omission of numbering was not inadvertent. Just as I.iii is numbered I.ii, so IV.vi is numbered IV.v. 11 In The Shakespeare First Folio (1955) Sir Walter Greg wrote of Bonduca , "the 1647 folio adds a division into scenes, which suggests a playhouse addition, unless it was introduced at the time of printing" (p. 144), and, later, about the Shakespeare Folio Richard III , "F introduces an imperfect division into acts and scenes. . . . The division was most likely introduced at the time of printing" (p. 197). In the latter case, certainly, the conditions would appear to have approximated those in Beggars Bush . 12 Only three boors have speaking parts and are present. The direction sounds like a general one in an author's working papers before he wrote the scene. 13 In fact, MS ends the direction with ' Singing: ' but then heads the following lines as ' Song ', a title wanting in F where it seems to have been attached to the direction in error. 14 Actually, this wording comes from MS; the F compositor misread his copy when he set ' and the rest of the Boores '. 15 Of course, it may have been that these exits were omitted in the prompt-book because they were not present in Massinger and that the F compositors supplied them. Perhaps there was a mixture; the evidence is uncertain. 16 Whether it was Knight or the MS scribe who was in error here cannot be determined. Only one sailor is required, and in MS at line 33 he is given a simple Exit direction. Of course, Knight for effect may have wanted to bring on several sailors, only one of whom had a speaking part, or he could have split up the assignment of different speeches among several sailors at lines 15, 16, 18, 20. If so, however, the prefixes do not distinguish different sailors nor is anything done about the gift of money to only one at line 32. Probably this is a case of simple error in adding a plural -s . 17 Knight's mistake thus provides no exit for Van-dunk and the guests, unless they are supposed to remain on stage as mutes to follow Bertha in a general exit to end the scene after her soliloquy in lines 108-111. Florez' address 'nay pray goe in Sir' is clearly to Van-dunk, and thus the repeated 'Sir' in 'I will not stay; beleeve Sir' is necessarily addressed to him as well, not to Gerrard, as indicated by its being a response to Van-dunk's promise 'he cannot stay long from her'. Moreover, Florez never addresses the beggar Clause as Sir . No doubt can exist what Massinger intended; but his failure to note an exit for Gerrard after his last speech confused Knight, who made a snap judgment without fully considering the action. 18 It is noteworthy that in MS this oath is transcribed in an Italian hand like the songs, with which it is perhaps confused. 19 Against such a hypothesis, however, is not only the specific reference in this case to the subject of the song, but also the case at III.i.96.1 in which the title 'Song' as a heading has been confused in F as part of the stage-direction, ' and a boy singing the Song ' (see above and footnote 13). 20 One cannot tell whether the possibility that Herbert might still refuse to license Believe as You List in its new form had anything to do with making up the prompt-book from Massinger's fair copy without re-transcription. Greg cites a few prompt-copies in the hands of the authors but feels that Believe as You List was not typical and that the usual authorial fair copy was re-transcribed to make up the prompt-book ( Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses: Commentary [1931], pp. 198-200). It would seem that Beaumont copied out Cupids Revenge for submission to the company, including Fletcher's scenes, and that this fair copy was preserved and later given to the printer of the quarto ( Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , 2 [1970], 323-324, 330-331).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printers and the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647: Section 1 (Thomas Warren's) by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Printer of Section 1 In the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, Section 1, in fours collating B-K 4 L 2 and containing The Mad Lover , The Spanish Curate , and The Little French Lawyer , and Quire b, four leaves in the preliminary section containing commendatory poems, were printed by Thomas Warren senior. His identification depends primarily upon a block which appears in the Folio on sigs. E1 and b2 v as well as in A collection of all the publicke Orders Ordinances and Declarations of both Houses of Parliament . . . by T. W. for Ed: Husband, 1646 and in Dugdale's History of S t Paul's Cathedral . . . Printed by Tho. Warren , MDCLVIII ; in addition, two ornamental initials from Section 1 are found in books printed by T. W. in 1649 and 1651. 1 Warren had been granted his freedom on 2 April 1638 and had registered his first book for publication on 1 August of the same year, having set up as a stationer in partnership with Joshua Kirton. 2 Over the next seven years his name appeared as bookseller of some twenty items, but in 1645 twenty-two titles appeared as printed by T. W., fifteen of which issued Parliamentary ordinances for Edward Husband, who styled himself Printer to the House of Commons. 3 T. W., as the imprint of the Collection of publicke Orders suggests, was Warren, the only known member of the Stationers' Company at the time whose name corresponds with the initials; he seems to have acquired a printing business by marrying Alice, the daughter of Matthew Law and the widow of a Norton, who had been operating a press in her own right in 1641 and 1642. 4 In 1646 and 1647 T. W. printed the following works: 1646 Wing A 10, C 1214, E 3443, F 2355, G 488, H 3808, and S 6126 ( Aglaura only) 1647 Wing A 1391, B 1071, E 1180, F 461, G 254, H 3096, M 355, S 2355, and S 5198. If, as Bald believed (p. 30), most of the Folio work was done in the autumn and winter of 1646, it seems likely that several of these books would have been in production concurrently with Section 1. I have seen five of them. Three (A 10, C 1214, and F 461) are of modest size, but one (H 3808) is a folio in fours running to 943 pages of text and a 24-page appendix. Its manufacture may have begun soon after it was ordered printed by Parliament on 5 August 1644, but, as it concludes with an ordinance of 17 November 1646, it apparently was in press along with Section 1. 5 The book is printed in a variety of founts, including, I believe, the Folio fount. Warren's work on Aglaura (S 6126) is a subject to which we shall return. There is no evidence to indicate how many presses Warren operated or how many workmen he usually employed, but at the time of his engagement on Section 1 he clearly was equipped to undertake printing jobs of substantial size. The fact that at least one of his books evidently was produced over a period of some two years, during which other works bearing his imprint were published, is indication enough that he did not throw all the resources of his shop into the manufacture of one book, completing it before commencing another. None of the Beaumont and Fletcher plays assigned to Warren appears to have been reallocated to another shop, but the brevity of Section 1 suggests that he was unwilling or unable to commit himself to as much work for the volume as the other printers engaged by Moseley. 6 What exigencies of scheduling or other circumstances led Warren to assign at particular times compositors or presses to this or another job cannot be known, but we must approach an analysis of the printing of Section 1 with the initial assumption that other books perhaps requiring the Folio workmen and their equipment were in simultaneous production.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Analytical Techniques The techniques available for the kind of analysis undertaken here will be familiar to those acquainted with Professor Hinman's work on the Shakespeare First Folio or with earlier studies of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio's printing. 7 Generally speaking, the reliability of the analysis depends upon the correlation within a temporal framework of three kinds of evidence: that pertaining to the order of the printing (derived usually from an examination of skeleton formes and related typographical matter), to the identity of the compositors (from spelling evidence), and to the order of composition and distribution (from type recurrence data). There are several conditions which may substantially aid the cause, the most important being (1) the exhibition of pronounced and contrasting spelling preferences by all the compositors, (2) the reappearance within quires of enough recognizable type to establish that a distribution was made, (3) the continued association of types with the typecases whence they originate, and (4) the devotion of the compositors and their equipment to the uninterrupted production of only one book at a time. Fortunately, all these conditions need not obtain for the analysis to succeed: (1) Although their spelling characteristics barely distinguished them, Hinman was able to show in certain parts of the Shakespeare Folio that because two typecases were simultaneously in use two compositors must have been setting type. 8 (2) By progressive deformation of components of the skeleton formes and by alteration in the components' disposition, we can frequently establish the order in which the formes imposed in a particular skeleton were printed. But if more than one skeleton was employed, we cannot tell without other evidence the order of the skeletons with respect to each other. An assumption of the regular alternation of the skeletons will not do, particularly if there were cessations in the printing of the book under study during which other work was accomplished. The other evidence most commonly available is that arising from distribution. For example, let us assume that the evidence from the skeleton formes establishes the printing order I and I' and II and II'; if type from I reappears in I' and II' and type from II reappears in II' but not in I', we may conclude, other evidence agreeing, that the order of printing and of composition as well was I-II-I'-II'. The actual situation may be more complicated, but the principle is capable of extension. Even if no types reappear within the quire, we may be able to deduce the correct sequence of the formes on embossing or other evidence, although under these conditions the relationship between composition and presswork can be extremely difficult or, if the evidence is elusive, impossible to ascertain. 9 (3) Hinman found that in Jaggard's shop, as a general rule, a type set from a certain case would later be distributed into that case. In William Wilson's shop, however, this practice seems not to have been followed consistently; there a compositor who needed type for new work distributed into the case at which he intended to set whatever wrought-off type was at hand, regardless of the case from which it originated. Thus types could migrate from case to case, and if they do, the only way to identify the case from which the new work was set is to discover among its types some from the same source as other types known to have been distributed into a particular case. If we can demonstrate, as happens to be true of Section 1, that type used to set B3 was distributed and then used again to set B4 from a case we will call Case B and if we then find B3 types on C2 v , it follows that C2 v was also set from Case B, assuming the page to have been the unit of distribution. In other words, in order to know from which case any new quire was set, we must have a linkage with the preceding quire of the same sort as the linkage within quires which permits us to say that any new page was set from the same case as a preceding one. 10 If there is no linkage between quires, however, we may seem to be in a desperate situation, for we cannot be sure that the new material is not being set from a hitherto unemployed case into which old types have been distributed. Faced with this difficulty, we must appeal to probability: if it can be shown that generally two and no more clusters appear on the graphs and that generally linkages associate one cluster with Case A and the other with Case B, we can assume that any new cluster should be associated with one of the known cases rather than a third. Thus, at Quire E, for example, since E1-3 v are linked with each other and with Case A, we should not be unduly concerned that E4-4 v are not definitely linked with Case B. 11 The matter is not crucial in any event, provided that spelling evidence makes the compositors' division of labor sufficiently clear. (4) Obviously some relationship must hold between the order of a book's printing and the order of its composition. As Hinman demonstrated, the type distributed into a certain case from a wrought-off forme will necessarily be the type used to compose the next material set from that case, for the types last distributed will lie on top of those previously distributed. This fact establishes a temporal connection between printing and composition, which is extended by the practical necessity for newly set material at some point to be printed off not only because that was the main object but because the number of types in the fount was finite and some had to be recaptured through distribution in order that composition continue. The general rule governing the significance of type recurrences is that "no forme has type in common with either the forme immediately preceding or that immediately following it" (Hinman, I, 81). This is a general rule, however, and it is subject to the same exceptions as the general rule that skeleton formes alternate. Types do sometimes appear in consecutive formes, an indication of the fact that the printing of the book has been discontinued for a time. 12 In fact, if we see the same types in consecutive formes, we know that an interruption must have occurred, and it is difficult to conceive of work being suspended on one book, the types being used to print some other matter, and then these same types reappearing in subsequent pages of the book under study in such an orderly way that we never suspect the suspension to have occurred. The odds would seem to favor there being some trace of the interruption, such as a spate of damaged types hitherto unobserved or, more likely, a failure of the type recurrence data to correlate with the testimony given by the skeleton formes as to the order of printing. Moreover, the intervening employment of the type will confuse the relationship between the witness of the graph with which we are immediately concerned and that of the graph for the quire preceding, for the source of the newly reappearing types will not be the columns of the earlier quire but the pages of some unknown book. When the intervening work has employed the Folio types, the evidence upon which we ground our analysis is likely to go in some measure haywire, and, although we can probably detect the suspension, we must be cautious in interpreting the disturbed data.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Problems with Spellings The reluctance of some compositors unequivocally to identify themselves or, once identified, their obstinate refusal to persist in the habits that earlier characterized their work is a woeful reality in bibliographical analysis. In Section 1 ambiguity in the spelling evidence is a particular problem, part of which may arise from inadequacy of method. Although we are warned that all spellings in the work under investigation may be significant, 13 without a computer we cannot deal in a practical way with the complete data of three plays, and we are compelled instead to work with a sample of spellings that seem significant. If the sample is too small or if it contains the wrong words, it will yield uncertain results, and it may be that one more skilfully drawn would permit finer discriminations than can be made here. Yet the collateral evidence is not very encouraging. Suckling's Aglaura was reprinted in octavo by Warren as a bibliographically independent part of the edition of Fragmenta Aurea of 1646. 14 The copy was the folio edition of 1638. A comparison of the two versions reveals that 1646, in addition to introducing next to no substantive changes, followed the accidentals of 1638 with considerable fidelity. There were, to be sure, some alterations in spelling: terminal -ee (in hee , mee , etc.) is sometimes reduced to -e but the copy's -ee is about as likely to be retained; terminal -ie occasionally becomes -y (especially in verie and everie ) but many -ie endings were accepted; the copy's beene is pretty consistently spelled been (I count eighteen changes to been and three retentions of the form as opposed to three retentions of beene ). The treatment accorded some other words (all of which may be significant in parts of Section 1) gives an idea of the character of the whole: Changed Retained again 3 2 againe -- 20 agen -- 24 agin -- 1 do-go 7 1 doe-goe 1 132 I'le-i'le 6 1 Ile-ile -- 9 neare 1 2 neere 2 7 neer -- 1 nere 3 -- Two years later Warren was again engaged upon Fragmenta Aurea , this time reprinting the non-dramatic works from a partially annotated copy of 1646. 15 His contribution to the 1648 edition included the poems as well as Suckling's letters and his Account of Religion , the first because of rhyme words and the two last because of full lines offering rather less opportunity for spelling variation than dramatic poetry. And indeed alterations in spelling are so near nil as not to require summary. I made no attempt to seek compositors by typographical investigation, but from the spellings of the 1646 Aglaura and the 1648 Poems , etc. we may conclude that in Warren's shop there was at least one workman who followed copy in a fairly docile way, either because he was not very assertive about his own preferences or because, in these two instances, the characteristics of the copy were much in accord with them. We have reason to think, of course, that some compositors were more energetic in styling material set from manuscript than from printed copy, and we will see that in The Mad Lover contrasting spelling patterns are manifested. In the two subsequent plays, however, the spelling evidence becomes more tenuous, as we might predict from the performance of Warren's compositors in the Suckling editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Analysis of Quires In what follows I offer as a sample analyses of four quires, B through E, excluding for lack of space much of the data upon which the examination is based. 16 Each quire is examined in turn except Quires C and D which, for reasons that will be obvious, are taken together. Evidence pertaining to presswork and revealing information about the order of printing is first considered, then evidence from types recurrences and spelling, which bears on the way in which type was composed and distributed and the identity of the compositors doing the work. For each quire but B, the first, it has been convenient to summarize the type recurrence data and the spelling evidence on graphs organized like those in previous sections of this study, but with these differences: (1) Latent types are not taken into account. If we suspect that Folio types during the course of the work were sometimes being used to set non-Folio material and that distributions were made without regard for the case from which the distributed types were last drawn, latent types become especially suspect. By "latent" I mean types not immediately reused after distribution but remaining in the case after the opportunity for reemployment passed only to appear in a later quire. Let us say that a32 was observed in H2 v b and K3 v a and that both H2 v b and K3 v a were set from Case A, the demonstration of this not depending on a32. We may believe that a32 was distributed into Case A with other H2 v b types, remained unused through the setting of Quire I pages composed at A, and at last was taken from the case when when K3 v was set. This indeed is likely to be a32's true history, and we could cite its appearance in K3 v a as further evidence for the setting of that column from Case A. A25, however, behaves differently. It is found in C1 v a and then in E4 v b. C1 v a was set from Case B, but was distributed into Case A before D3b was composed (D graph, line 9). E4 v b was later set from a case presumed to be B. How, then, did A25 move from Case A to Case B between C1 v a and E4 v b? It may be aberrant or it may actually have been used on one of the pages of D (D1, D1 v , or D4) set from Case A but distributed into Case B and have escaped notice there. But perhaps more likely is the possibility that it was employed in some non-Folio work set from Case A after Quire C was completed and before Quire E was begun and then was distributed into the other case. In any event, the vagaries of types like A25 cloud the testimony of the many others that do not seem to have been subject to disrupting influences, and since types like a32, which confirm the implications of other data, are equally numerous, it seems best to ignore all latents. (2) The spelling data displayed on each graph are an abstract of what appear to be the most significant forms for the identification of the compositors of the quire rather than a complete summary of all spellings tested. (3) Evidence of type shortage is not reported, although many substitutions were made throughout the section. These were investigated and found to correlate only feebly with information produced by the type recurrences, substitutions either having been sporadic or the boxes of type in inadequate supply having been fouled with replacement types. One last matter pertaining to the evidence deserves mention: the effect of proof-correction upon the pattern of type recurrences. As Hinman discovered and as has been found in previous sections of this study, most recognizable types reappear because they have been distributed and reset in routine fashion, but a few do not, having become dissociated from their fellows in some extraordinary manner. These are aberrant types. One way in which a type can become aberrant is through press-correction. Collation of fifteen copies of the Folio has turned up press-variants on two dozen pages of Section 1, some of which were heavily altered in as many as three rounds of correction. None or these variants involves any of the types represented on the graphs, but some may have become aberrant through press-corrections that have not been discovered. QUIRE B The Mad Lover I.i-II.ii Presswork In Skeleton I Rule 14 was replaced by Rule 15, which continues into subsequent quires, an indication that B2 v :3 preceded B1 v :4. 17 Composition and Distribution The following types and rules appear in B2 v and B4 v : d25, d26, e25, e28, g23, g36, h22, h43, o33, r22, u21, A21, A25, C22, G22, G24, W27, C 22, C 30, and CR29 and the following in B3 and B4: b22, d27, d41, I22, and CR28. The reappearance of type from both pages of B2 v :3 implies that this forme was printed and distributed before either B4 or B4 v was set and hence before either B1 v :4 or B1:4 v was machined. That it shares no types with B2:3 v suggests that B2:3 v was run either immediately before or immediately after B2 v :3 and the fact that B2:3 v was not distributed until Quires C and D were in progress (C graph, lines 3, 4, and 6; D graph, line 4) indicates that B2:3 v followed B2 v :3 through the press. There is no way to prove that it was not composed before B2 v :3, but its later machining clearly suggests that its composition also followed. Since B4 type reappears before B1 type (C graph, lines 5, 9, and 11), B1 v :4 must have preceded B1:4 v . The order of printing was thus: Skeleton: I II I II Forme: B2 v :3 B2:3 v B1 v :4 B1:4 v Center-rule: 29 28 30 36 32 28 -- 29 Because B2 v type is found only in B4 v and B3 type only in B4, it is unlikely that both type pages of the forme were distributed into the same type case, and spelling evidence indicates that two compositors were at work in the quire, Compositor A setting B1-B2 v and B4 v and Compositor B setting B3-B4. The two runs of pages are distinguished by the following variant spellings: We may conclude that the quire was set from two typecases by two compositors, their division of labor pretty certainly indicating that they worked more-or-less simultaneously for most of the quire: Case: A A A A A Compositor A: B2 v B2 B1 v B1 B4 v Case: B B B Compositor B: B3 B3 v B4 The fact that Compositor B left A alone to set B1:4 v suggests that he was temporarily off the job, and there are signs in Quire C that his attention may have been given briefly to other work. QUIRES C AND D The Mad Lover II.ii-V.iv Presswork In Skeleton I the foot of the T in RT I is nicked on C1, D4 and subsequently but is whole on C3 and C4; Rule 18 is bent at 5.90 cm. on C4 v and subsequently but not so bent on C1 v and C2 v ; Rule 12, which appears on C3 and C4, is replaced by Rule 13 on C1 and D4. These details show C2 v :3 and C1 v :4 to have been machined before C1:4 v and D1 v :4. Rule 24 is bent on C1 and C4 but not so bent on C3; Rule 16, which appears on C3, is replaced by Rule 17 on C1 and C4. Thus C2 v :3 was machined before C1 v :4 and C1:4 v . In D1 v :4 the The of RT III is reset at D1 v and Rule 24 is bent out at 1.30 on D4. D1 v :4, then, must have been machined after all the formes of C imposed in Skeleton I; and the evidence, taken together, proves that these formes were worked in the order Skeleton: I I I I Forme: C2 v :3 C1 v :4 C1:4 v D1 v :4 Center-rule: 28 36 33 28 28 36 32 -- In Skeleton II Rule 3 is nicked at 7.80 throughout D but not so nicked on C2, and Rule 4 is bent left on D1 but not so bent on C2. C2:3 v was thus first printed. Rules 7 (nicked at 14.85), 8 (nicked at 15.40), and 9 (bent right at the top) all appear damaged on D3 v but not on D2 v , showing that D2 v :3 preceded D2:3 v . The appearance on D2 and D3 of Rule 5 (which may be the imprint of the foot of another rule) suggests, though it does not prove, that D2:3 v was run directly after D2 v :3. The order of printing of these formes was either Skeleton: II II II II Forme: C2:3 v D2 v :3 D2:3 v D1:4 v Center-rule: 32 29 29 32 33 29 28 -- or Skeleton: II II II II Forme: C2:3 v D1:4 v D2 v :3 D2:3 v Center-rule: 32 29 28 -- 29 32 33 29 Composition and Distribution As shown by the graphs, types reappearing in Quires C and D fall into two quite distinct clusters. One embraces all Quire C but C2 and is linked by B3 type (C graph, lines 1 and 2) with the typecase from which Compositor B set his pages of Quire B. The other embraces C2 and Quire D (where D4 is a part-page and D4 v a blank) and is linked by B2 v types (D graph, line 1) with Compositor A's previous work. That all the aberrant types discovered in Quire C (that is, types that should be found in material set from Case A rather than Case B) are C's suggests the borrowing of some of these italic letters from Case A, and that all the aberrant types in the Case A pages come from C3a may indicate that the column was distributed primarily into Case A rather than into Case B as indicated on the Quire C graph (line 14), although if this were true the C3a types, unless covered by C2:3 v types simultaneously distributed, would be expected to reappear in D2 v rather than D3. The two clusters of reappearing types accord well with the two spelling patterns which in Quire B served to distinguish Compositor B's work from Compositor A's, making it generally clear that Compositor B set all Quire C but C2 and that Compositor A set C2 and Quire D. The two near ( e ) spellings in C4a, where five unusual dye spellings also occur, are found in the song, set in italics, on that page; they could possibly indicate another hand but are, I think, more likely to be an uncharacteristic response on Compositor B's part to copy of a different nature from that of the text. The one B1b type appearing on C4a (C graph, line 9) is in the song; if it is correctly identified, the song would at least have been set from Case B. Although there are a few inevitable obscurities, the Quire C graph allows us to follow Compositor B's work with some precision. If we suppose that B began work on C2 v immediately after he completed B4, we can roughly represent the temporal relationship between the activities of the two workmen as follows: While Compositor A set: B1 B4 v C2 Compositor B set: C2 v C3 C3 v . The graph, however, clearly implies that B4 v a was distributed into Case B between the composition of C3 v a and C3 v b (line 7). Because the sequence given above would have B4 v on the press while C3 v was composed, it is probable that the relationship was more like the following, where X represents an interval in Folio composition: While Compositor A set: B1 B4 v C2 Compositor B set: X C2 v C3 C3 v . Since B3 types reappear in C2 v (lines 1 and 2), work must have begun with this page, perhaps after the partial distribution of B3 v (lines 3 and 4). The B3 v types reappear in a peculiar way. When types were distributed and reused immediately to set the material under scrutiny, we most often find a spate of recognizable letters followed by the occasional and rather isolated reappearance of other letters from the same source (as in lines 5, 6, and 7). Types from B3 v , however, reappear sporadically from the first, even though of the sixteen types recognized on B3 v fourteen reappear somewhere in Quire C. Had the B3 v types gone into non-Folio matter whence they were later distributed for reemployment in Section 1, we would expect a group of them to show up in a subsequent quire. Here it seems instead that the distribution of B3 v began and was suspended, an insufficient number having been returned to the case to cover up the layer of B3 types already in the boxes. Why much of B3 v was left standing for a while is not apparent, but it looks as though the remainder was not returned to the case until after C2 v was completed and before C3 started, whereupon the types were blanketed by the further distribution of B4 (lines 5 and 10). 18 The composition of C3 ensued, following which the forme was imposed in Skeleton II with CRs 28 (from B4) and 36 (from B3 v ) and sent to press. While Compositor B was engaged with C3 or C3 v , Compositor A set C2, so that C2:3 v was the second forme ready for the press. From this point on, Compositor B seems to have set C1 v :4 and C1:4 v without significant irregularity, the priority of C1 v :4 being indicated by the fact that C2 v a types only reappear on C4b (line 12) whereas C1 and C4 v contain types from C2 v a as well as types from C2 v b and C3 (lines 13-15). So far the evidence points to the following order of printing: Skeleton: I II I Forme: C2 v :3 C2:3 v C1 v :4 Center-rule: 28 36 32 29 33 28 When other evidence relating to the order of printing was examined earlier, it was concluded that of the formes imposed in Skeleton II either D2 v :3 or D1:4 v must have followed C2:3 v through the press. Because D2 v type reappears in Quire D (D graph, lines 13 and 14) but D1:4 v type does not 19 , we may be sure that the first of the two possible orders is correct and that D2 v :3 was the next forme after C2:3 v to be machined in Skeleton II. Moreover, the reappearance of D2 v type later in Quire D indicates that it was the first forme of the quire to be printed, and the earlier reappearance of its type than type from C1 (lines 15 and 16) shows that D2 v :3 preceded C1:4 v through the press. Thus the scheme for the order of the printing may be continued as follows: Skeleton: I II I II I II Forme: C1 v :4 D2 v :3 C1:4 v D2:3 v D1 v :4 D1:4 v Center-rule: 33 28 29 32 28 36 33 29 32 -- 28 -- Insofar as composition is concerned, however, it is obvious from the reappearance of the C2:3 v CRs (32 and 29) and C2 types (lines 7 and 8) in D2 v :3 that Compositor A did not begin setting Quire D material immediately after he completed C2. Although the text contained in the two quires was divided between the workmen more-or-less evenly, Compositor B being responsible for seven pages and Compositor A seven and roughly a half (D4, on which the play ends, contains thirty-one lines of text followed by a prologue and an epilogue, both brief), it seems that composition was rarely simultaneous. Compositor A probably set C2 at about the same time that B set C3 v , but the compositors' singlehanded work on so many formes must have been necessary because both were from time to time engaged in other pursuits, returning to Quires C and D as occasion permitted. QUIRE E The Spanish Curate I.i-II.ii Presswork Skeleton I imposed E1 v :4 and E2 v :3; II imposed E1:4 v and E2:3 v . E1 v , properly page 26, bears the page number 28 which also appears correctly and set in the same type on E2 v , the numerals evidently having been carried with the running-title from the latter page to the former. In addition, a bend at 16.05 in Rule 20 is more pronounced on E4 and subsequently than on E3. These details show that E2 v :3 was printed before E1 v :4. A nick in Rule 28 at 1.20 appearing on E4 v but not on E3 v indicates that E1:4 v followed E2:3 v . E3, page 29, is misnumbered 27, but because the types are different from those appearing on E2, the true page 27, this fact has no significance for the order of printing. Composition and Distribution Within Quire E some types are found on both E1 v and E2 (line 11) and since E2:3 v was printed early and E1 v :4 late, the following order is implied: Skeleton: II I II I Forme: E2:3 v E2 v :3 E1:4 v E1 v :4 Center-rule: 35 29 36 33 -- 31 34 32 Because in previous quires the first forme set and machined was $2 v :3, this sequence seems quite odd; moreover, part of the typographical evidence in Quire E is garbled in such a way as to suggest that the ordinary affinity between presswork and composition was lacking. Two graphs are shown, the first constructed on the assumption that for some reason not apparent E2:3 v was set first and the second constructed on the assumption that, as usual, E2 v :3 preceded. Since E2b type appears only on E1 v , E1 v :4 is shown in both as the last forme, although the only obvious advantage accruing from the prior composition of E1:4 v would have been the temporary gain of a little time, for E1 bears a head-title and only about two-thirds the text found on full pages. Both graphs indicate that E1-3 v were set from Case A by Compositor A and that E4-4 v were the work of a new man, Compositor C, who in this quire is most readily distinguished from his fellow by a preference for I'l ( l ) and an aversion to the short forms do-go which A sometimes admits. That Compositor C was working at Case B is not demonstrable, although for the reasons given above (p. 141) it seems likely that he was. The one D1a type on E4 v a (line 16) probably must be regarded as aberrant and discounted. It is thus troublesome to find no link between E4 v and E4 established by D1 v :4 types carrying over into E4 (lines 12-14) because the possibility is thereby opened that E4 was set from a third case to which Compositor C would have moved after the completion of E4 v . This is not impossible, but it is simpler to suppose that no D1 v :4 types appear in E4 because they were thoroughly covered by new types from D1. We discover next to no evidence for the distribution of D4a (line 15) because that column contains only two identified types in its sixteen lines of text. If we take it that E2:3 v was first composed and machined, it would follow that since D1:4 v was imposed in Skeleton II some time would have elapsed between its printing and the imposition of E2:3 v in the same skeleton. During this interval D3, C4 v , and D2:3 v could have been distributed, so that our first graph shows types from these sources reappearing in a way that suggests no very pronounced relationship with the sequence in which the pages were printed, except that D3 v a would have been last distributed (lines 1 and 2). The intermingling of these types might have occurred if they were used in intermediate work, but three other anomalies remain difficult to account for: the apparent distribution of C4 v after D3 v (lines 3 and 4), the very early reappearance of aberrant types from D1 v and D1 (lines 13 and 17), and the absence from E1 of all previously recognized types but one (line 4). The assumption that E2 v :3 was first composed and machined has different consequences. In this event the order of printing would have been Skeleton: I II II I Forme: E2 v :3 E2:3 v E1:4 v E1 v :4 Center-rule: 36 33 35 29 -- 31 34 32 Here the discontinuation falls between E2:3 v and E1:4 v , and at least one of our earlier anomalies subsides. E1 in fact contains a good many types which show up later in the section; their initial appearance on E1 suggests that non-Folio matter was distributed into Case A just before that page was set, an assumption that accords with the presumed interval at that point. In addition, as the second graph shows, the aberrants from D1 v and D1 fall in a more acceptable place, and the distributions of D3 (lines 1 and 3) and D2 (lines 5 and 6) appear in the sequence of their machining. C4 v (lines 2 and 9) remains rather awkward unless we suppose that most of its distribution was delayed until E3 v a, but on the whole the second graph tells a more orderly and more reasonable story than the first. What seems to have happened, then, is that Compositor A, having completed Quire D, continued with E2 v :3 and E2:3 v . At this point work was interrupted. Before it resumed, A distributed some non-Folio material in preference to E2 v :3, which was to remain standing until Quire F's composition, and then fell to work on E1 and E1 v as Compositor C set E4 v and E4. By the time E1 v was reached, E2 v :3 and E2:3 v were equally available for distribution, and A happened to choose E2b first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Summary The analysis continues after the same fashion. From Quire E on, there are further dislocations in the typographical evidence caused, I am convinced, by the occasional use of the Folio types to set other material; because of failures in linkage, some additional suspicions arise in certain quires about the employment of a third case, and hence the presence of a third compositor; and the spelling patterns are neither as pronounced nor as consistent as one could wish. On the whole, the evidence is stronger in The Mad Lover than in The Spanish Curate or The Little French Lawyer , but even in those texts (where further investigation may be warranted) I believe the analysis establishes in outline if not always in detail the history of the printing.

In 1646 Bussy D'Ambois appeared as 'Printed by T. W. for Robert Lunne ' (C 1943), but the title-leaf is a cancel, the rest of the book being sheets of Alice Norton's 1641 edition (W. W.

Because several Nortons were active in the period, the identity of Alice's first husband cannot be determined, but a family connection with John Norton jr. may explain why McKerrow's device no. 267, which belonged to Norton in 1639, appears in two of T.

Turner, "Section 2," SB , pp. 41, 48-49. 11 At least a few types from C2 v or C3, the last type pages distributed into Case B before the setting of C1 and C4 v , the last pages of the quire to be composed (Quire C graph, lines 14-15) ought by rights to show up in E4 or E4 v . That they do not may be accidental—that is, there may be such types on E4-4 v but they were not recognized. On the other hand, there are strong signs of a suspension of Folio printing during Quire E, in which event all the recognizable type from C2 v and C3 (as well as that from the pages of B distributed into Case B) may have been standing in non-Folio formes at the time E4-4 v were composed. The problem is further complicated by the fact that most of the Case B type used to compose Quire C was distributed into Case A for the composition of Quire D. Of this, more below. 12 In Quires A-E of the Shakespeare Folio, for example, "the same distinctive types are . . . very frequently found in consecutive formes . . . . Between the setting of one forme and the setting of its successor there must more or less regularly have been an interval during which the first forme had its run at the press . . . . [During this interval the Folio compositors must] have been occupied with other work" (Hinman, I, 342-3). 13 See T. H.

The evidence is too slight to allow more than a guess, but it does no harm to suppose B4a and B4b distributed at the same time. 19 That D2 v rather than D1 v and D1 belongs on the ordinate of the graph (in other words, that the types migrated from D2 v to D1 v and D1 and not vice versa) is indicated by the fact that no D1 types are found in D2 or D3 v , D2:3 v having been printed after D2 v :3.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The American Edition of Mrs. Dalloway by E. F. Shields</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1924, Harcourt, Brace and Company agreed to publish, even before reading the manuscripts, the American editions of both Mrs. Dalloway and The Common Reader . Until then, the American editions of Virginia Woolf's works came out later—up to five years later—than the English editions. ( The Voyage Out : Duckworth and Co., March 26, 1915, George H. Doran, May 20, 1920; Night and Day : Duckworth and Co., October 20, 1919, George H. Doran, September 29, 1920; Monday or Tuesday : Hogarth, March 7 or 8, 1921, Harcourt, Brace and Company, November 23, 1921; Jacob's Room : Hogarth, October 27, 1922, Harcourt, Brace and Company, February 8, 1923.) 1 In order to eliminate copyright problems, Leonard Woolf requested simultaneous publication dates for the American and English editions of both volumes; in addition, Virginia Woolf wanted The Common Reader to appear before Mrs. Dalloway . But, although Hogarth published The Common Reader on April 23, 1925 and Mrs. Dalloway on May 14, 1925, due to various time pressures, the best that Harcourt could do was to publish both The Common Reader and Mrs. Dalloway on May 14, 1925. Because Harcourt was attempting simultaneous publication, it was not possible to set the American editions from published English texts. Although the Woolfs were prepared to send manuscripts of both volumes, Donald Brace—in a letter to Leonard Woolf dated December 16, 1924—stated that while the manuscripts would be helpful to their readers (in preparing promotional material), Harcourt would prefer to set from "finally corrected English proofs." 2 The Woolfs conformed to the request and, as a result, the American edition of Mrs. Dalloway was set from English page proofs which were specially prepared for Harcourt by Virginia Woolf herself. 3 Fortunately, these page proofs are still in existence and they are now housed in the Manuscripts Department of the Lilly Library at Indiana University. The only marks on the proofs are revisions made by Virginia Woolf in a purplish ink and directions to the printer made by Harcourt in pencil. A collation of the American and English editions of Mrs. Dalloway reveals numerous variants; many of them are minor—a comma inserted or changed to a semicolon, a hyphen added, etc.; but some are substantive—words changed, clauses added, etc. From a study of these variants in light of the corrected page proofs, we can draw two major conclusions: 1) Except for relatively few instances, Harcourt, Brace and Company did "reproduce exactly"—as Donald Brace said they would—from the corrected proofs. 2) Although Harcourt obviously felt that they would have a more reliable text—virtually identical with the Hogarth text—if they set from corrected proofs instead of from a manuscript, the corrected proofs from which the American edition was set were not the "finally" corrected proofs which Harcourt had requested. Some changes made on the proofs (and thus incorporated into the Harcourt edition) do not appear in the Hogarth edition; at the same time, additional or alternate changes appear in the Hogarth edition but not in the Harcourt edition for the simple reason that Harcourt was never informed of these changes. The corrected proofs at Lilly Library show, first of all, that the vast majority of the changes indicated by Virginia Woolf are included in both the English and the American editions. Some of these changes are fairly substantial, and a few examples will illustrate their range: Proof Sheets Woolf's Revision himself felt. Old Mrs. Parry--Aunt Helena--that was her name--Mr. Parry's sister, who was supposed to preside, detested people being late. (p. 93) himself felt, and had sat down by old Miss Parry--Aunt Helena--Mr. Parry's sister, who was supposed to preside. (Hogarth, p. 93; Harcourt, p. 91) He said to himself as they were getting into the boat, "They suit each other," dully, without any resentment; but it was an obvious thing. Dalloway suited Clarissa. (p. 96) He said to himself as they were getting into the boat, "She will marry that man," dully, without any resentment; but it was an obvious thing. Dalloway would marry Clarissa. (Hogarth, p. 96; Harcourt, p. 95) But Rezia Warren Smith cried out, walking Harley Street, that she had been deserted. (p. 155) But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she did not like that man. (Hogarth, p. 155; Harcourt, p. 154) Many of Virginia Woolf's revisions are very minor, involving polishing the style, correcting the punctuation, or eliminating inconsistencies. Although some of these changes are extremely small, they have been incorporated into both editions: Proof Sheets Woolf's Revision she cried out to herself (p. 21) she cried to herself (Hogarth, p. 21; Harcourt, p. 17) the aeroplane shot farther away (p. 32) the aeroplane shot further away (Hogarth, p. 32; Harcourt, p. 29) "Who is that?" (p. 51) "Who is that ?" (Hogarth, p. 51; Harcourt, p. 48) Was she, he wondered, as she moved, respectable? (Hogarth, p. 81) Was she, he wondered as she moved, respectable? (Hogarth, p. 81; Harcourt, p. 79) Yet heaven knows he loved her. (p. 93) Yet Heaven knows he loved her. (Hogarth, p. 93; Harcourt, p. 91) But he was--remarkably kind. (p. 157) But he had been--remarkably kind. (Hogarth, p. 157; Harcourt, p. 157) Yet, at the same time that relatively minute changes are followed in both editions, some changes which Virginia Woolf made on the proof sheets are to be found only in the Harcourt edition; the Hogarth edition retains the unrevised version of the original type-set: Proof Sheets and Hogarth Edition Woolf's Revisions, Included in Harcourt Edition some awful quarrel (p. 51) some quarrel (p. 49) the wife of a Major--thank Heaven she had refused to marry him! (pp. 70-71) the wife of a Major in the Indian Army--think Heaven she had refused to marry him! (p. 68) said Aunt Helena--poor old lady! (p. 95) said Aunt Helena--old Miss Parry! (p. 94) give him one kiss on the cheek-- Here he was (pp. 122-123) give him one kiss--Here he was (p. 122) he thinks, how strange. (p. 127) he thinks, as he looks at chairs and tables, how strange. (p. 126) (The leaden circles dissolved in the air.) (p. 143) The leaden circles dissolved in the air. (p. 142) that evening. (p. 149) that evening he murmured. (p. 149) this sense; his sense of proportion. (p. 151) this sense; in fact, his sense of proportion. (p. 151) If they failed, he (p. 154) If they failed him, he (p. 154) a little farther. (p. 205) a little further. (p. 206) Only human beings? (p. 225) Only human beings--what did they want? (p. 226) Always her body went through it, when she was told, first, suddenly, of an accident; her dress flamed, her body burnt. (p. 277) Always her body went through it first, when she was told, suddenly, of an accident; her dress flamed, her body burnt. (p. 280) have perished. She had escaped. But that young man (p. 279) have perished. But that young man. (p. 282) There are also instances in which although both Harcourt and Hogarth incorporate revisions of the original type-set, they incorporate different revisions. Some variants are minor, perhaps the result of changes which Virginia Woolf made for the Hogarth edition on the final proof-sheets. Thus, page 90 of the first page proofs reads: a table after tea. (The room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke.) On the proof sheets, Virginia Woolf called for the removal of the period after "tea", the insertion of "and", and the removal of the parentheses. Harcourt (p. 88) follows the directions exactly: a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke. Hogarth (p. 90) adds a comma: a table after tea, and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke. Other variants in the revisions are more troublesome because they alter the reading of a passage. On page 71 of the proof sheets, the type-set reads: And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her, kissed him,—actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her In the margin, Virginia Woolf indicated that a "(—)" was to be inserted after "flashing". Whether she meant the "(—)" to indicate a hyphen or a dash is not clear. Harcourt (p. 69) presents it as a dash: And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her, kissed him,—actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing—plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her In the Hogarth edition (pp. 71-72), the change involves a hyphen which appears between "silver" and "flashing": And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her, kissed him,—actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver-flashing plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her Listed below are the other major instances in which Harcourt follows the directed revisions of the proof sheets while Hogarth follows different revisions: very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously. As he sat smiling, the quarter struck—the quarter to twelve. (Proof sheets, p. 108) very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously. As he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck—the quarter to twelve. (Harcourt, p. 106) very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously at the dead man in the grey suit. As he sat smiling, the quarter struck—the quarter to twelve. (Hogarth, p. 108) Miss Kilman was quite different from any one she knew. (Proof sheets, p. 198) Miss Kilman made one feel so small. (Harcourt, p. 198) Miss Kilman was quite different from any one she knew; she made one feel so small. (Hogarth, p. 198) she could not, to Elizabeth. "I pity other people much more." (Proof sheets, p. 200) she could not, not to Elizabeth. "I pity other people," she said, "more." (Harcourt, p. 200) she could not, not to Elizabeth. "I pity other people much more." (Hogarth, p. 200) her grandmother's ring which Marie Antoinette had given her—had he got it right?—to come to Bourton. (Proof sheets, p. 283) her grandmother's ring which Marie Antoinette had given her great-grand-father to come to Bourton. (Harcourt, p. 286) her great-grandfather's ring which Marie Antoinette had given him—had he got it right?—to come to Bourton. (Hogarth, p. 283) There are very few instances in which Harcourt clearly did not follow Virginia Woolf's directed changes. On page 106 of the proofs, the type-set reads "hard, white, imperishable words"; Virginia Woolf indicated that a comma should be inserted after "imperishable". Hogarth (p. 106) adds the comma, but Harcourt (p. 105) does not. Although Virginia Woolf specifically indicated that a comma should be added, one can easily see why Harcourt did not want to insert it and thus separate the last adjective in the series from the noun modified. Nevertheless, the omission is unusual in that Harcourt chose to ignore a clear and unambiguous revision. Normally, Harcourt diligently followed all directions, attempting to print the text exactly in accordance with Virginia Woolf's wishes. When Harcourt did not follow Virginia Woolf's directions, it generally did so because the directions seemed incomplete, because the directions were confusing, or because—if taken literally—the directions would lead to problems with grammar or punctuation. On page 236 of the proof sheets, the type-set reads: not in the least like that, as Daisy, in spite of her two small children, used to compare them. The Hogarth edition (p. 236) follows the various changes indicated by Virginia Woolf: not in the least, Daisy thought, when in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them. But, although on the proof sheets Virginia Woolf crossed out "like that", she changed her mind and put "stet" in the margin and four dots under "like that". The Harcourt edition (pp. 237-238) retains the phrase: not in the least like that, Daisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them. The comma after "when" is not indicated in Virginia Woolf's revisions; Harcourt apparently believed that Virginia Woolf meant the phrase to be in apposition (as it was in the original type-set) and thus inserted the comma. Page 90 of the proof sheets reads: a great botanist. (She wore always a black tin collecting-box slung between her shoulders; marched off in thick boots with a great stick.) According to Virginia Woolf's revision, it should read: a great botanist, marching off in thick boots with a black collecting box slung between her shoulders. Harcourt (p. 91) follows her corrections, but also inserts a hyphen in "collecting-box" (based on the hyphen in the original type-set). Hogarth (p. 93) prints: a great botanist, marching off in thick boots with a black tin collecting box slung between her shoulders. For all of her care in using correct printer's symbols, Virginia Woolf tended not to realize the particulars of her corrections; frequently, Harcourt was forced to decide between what was actually indicated and what was presumably wanted. For example, on page 79 of the proofs, the type reads: "Peter Walsh felt he had made it, too, a great renunciation". In her directions, Virginia Woolf encircled "too" and the following comma, indicating that they should be placed after "he". Also, the indefinite article "a" before "great renunciation" was to be replaced by "the". The Hogarth edition (p. 79) reads: "Peter Walsh felt he, too, had made it the great renunciation". The Harcourt edition (p. 77) reads: "Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation". On the basis of Woolf's directions, it would be hard to say that either version is wrong. Hogarth transposes the entire appositional structure for "too", including both commas; Harcourt transposes only the word "too", deleting one of the commas, and thus placing "the great renunciation" in apposition to the word "it". In one place, the directed revision apparently so mystified Harcourt that in order to include it Harcourt changed an indirect quotation to a direct quotation. On page 142 of the proof sheets the sentence reads: "Communication is health; communication is happiness." Virginia Woolf deleted the period, replacing it with a comma, and added the sentence "Communication he muttered." If followed exactly, the revision would read: Communication is health; comunication is happiness, Communication he muttered. Harcourt (p. 141) deals with the problem by turning it into a direct quotation of one sentence and adding a dash: "Communication is health; communication is happiness, communication—" he muttered. Hogarth (p. 142) stays closer to the original by simply transposing the comma: Communication is health; communication is happiness. Communication, he muttered. It is important to note that when a revision involved the deletion or addition of words, Harcourt attempted to follow Woolf's directions literally, even when the accuracy of the indicated revision might be doubted. On page 141, the proofs read: "It was at that moment (Rezia had left) the great revelation took place." Virginia Woolf crossed out "had left", replacing it with "gone shopping", and added "that" after the parentheses. Following the revision exactly, the Harcourt edition (p. 140) reads: "It was at that moment (Rezia gone shopping) that the great revelation took place." The Hogarth edition (p. 141) retains the original "had": "It was at that moment (Rezia had gone shopping) that the great revelation took place." At times, the directed revision was obviously inadequate, and Harcourt was forced to use its own judgment. For example, page 245 of the proofs reads: this interminable . . ., he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire. (He had held out that copper millions of times.) Surrey was all out once more—this interminable life. If followed literally, Virginia Woolf's revision would read: this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire he had held out that copper millions of times.) Surrey was all out once more)—this interminable life. Harcourt (p. 247) corrects the revision: this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire—he had held out that copper millions of times. Surrey was all out once more) —this interminable life. The Hogarth edition (p. 245) reads: this interminable— (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire (he had held out that copper millions of times) Surrey was all out once more) —this interminable life. There are several instances in which the Hogarth and the Harcourt editions read identically, although Harcourt made corrections on its own authority. Page 117 of the proofs reads: Lady Bexborough held herself upright, she said once (so did Clarissa herself; she never lounged in any sense of the word; she was straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact). Virginia Woolf encircled "she said once" and indicated that it was to be inserted before "held"; she did not supply any additional punctuation. But both Harcourt (p. 116) and Hogarth (p. 117) add the needed comma: "Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright". Similarly, page 93 of the proofs reads: going on making it up. He wandered off alone In her revision, Virginia Woolf deleted the period, inserted "and", and changed the "H" to lower case, but she did not indicate any punctuation to replace the deleted period. Both Harcourt (p. 90) and Hogarth (p. 92) add a comma: "going on making it up, and he wandered off alone". In addition to the cases in which Virginia Woolf made marginal revisions but did not supply proper or consistent punctuation, Harcourt—on its own authority—made other corrections. On page 110 of the proofs, Virginia Woolf directed the insertion of an "h" in "Betty Whatsername". Harcourt (p. 108) inserts the "h" and also adds an apostrophe: "Betty What 'shername". Hogarth (p. 110) reads: "Betty Whatshername". In another instance, the proofs (p. 69) read: "but in her heart she felt. All the same; he is in love." Hogarth (p. 69) follows Virginia Woolf's revision: "but in her heart she felt, all the same; he is in love." Apparently feeling that the indicated revision was inadequate, Harcourt (p. 67) prints: "but in her heart she felt, all the same, he is in love." Other changes made by Harcourt: Original Version as Followed By Hogarth Changes Made By Harcourt On Its Own Authority grey white (p. 22) grey-white (p. 18) saying "Good-bye Clarissa" (p. 73) saying "Good-bye, Clarissa" (p. 71) Whitbreads, Kindersleys, Cunninghams, Kinlock Jones's (p. 110) Whitbreads, Kinderleys, Cunninghams, Kinloch-Jones's (p. 109) putting her arms round Septimus, her cheeks against his (p. 135) putting her arms round Septimus, her cheek against his (p. 134) realised the obligations which size, wealth, health entail (p. 156) realised the obligations which size, wealth, health, entail (p. 156) with the Dalloway ladies, perhaps a hundred years ago?

Although Harcourt followed the English edition in using the British spelling for such words as "kerb", "colour", "tyres", and "centre", Harcourt was unwilling to follow Virginia Woolf in her somewhat inconsistent use of punctuation. The style Virginia Woolf was presumably following states that commas and periods go within the quotation marks if they are grammatically part of the quoted material; they go outside the quotation marks if they are not part of the quoted material but part of the enclosing sentence. A few samples taken from the Hogarth edition will show, however, that Virginia Woolf did not consistently follow this convention: "However," said Lady Bruton, anxious to leave the subject, "we shall hear the whole story from Peter himself." (p. 163) Now Mrs. Marsham wrote: "She had told Ellie Henderson she would ask Clarissa—Ellie so much wanted to come". (pp. 177-178) "And it came over me 'I might have married you'," she said, thinking of Peter sitting there in his little bow-tie; with that knife, opening it, shutting it. "Just as he always was, you know." (p. 179) Yes, they liked a man who said "Bartlett pears." (p. 242) Old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after "your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright". (p. 273) Only Richard agreed with her, "didn't like his taste, didn't like his smell." (p. 276) "You," she said, only "you", saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders. (p. 81) She had called Richard "Wickham". (p. 282) when she implored him (as she did now quite clearly) "look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently," she no longer saw brown eyes (p. 125) Harcourt tended to standardize the punctuation, according to the American system, by putting all commas and periods within the quotation marks: Now Mrs. Marsham wrote "she had told Ellie Henderson she would ask Clarissa—Ellie so much wanted to come." (p. 178) In this instance, Harcourt followed the proofs in giving no punctuation after "wrote" and in not capitalizing "she". On the proofs the terminal punctuation has been encircled in pencil; Virginia Woolf's own revisions are in a purplish ink, while Harcourt's directions to the printer are in pencil. On the proofs, only a few of the punctuation changes are encircled in pencil; the others were apparently made by the printer or were caught on Harcourt's own page proofs. Thus, we have in the American edition: "And it came over me 'I might have married you,'" she said, thinking of Peter sitting there in his little bow-tie; with that knife, opening it, shutting it. "Just as he always was, you know." (pp. 179-180) Old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after "your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright." (p. 276) As was the case with some of the punctuation changes discussed earlier, Harcourt occasionally made changes on its own authority which coincide almost identically with changes ultimately made in the Hogarth edition. Thus, page 275 of the proofs reads: His father minded even more than he did, she thought "being", she said, "nothing but a great boy himself". Although Virginia Woolf made no corrections on the proofs, Harcourt prints the sentence as follows: His father minded even more than he did, she thought "being," she said, "nothing but a great boy himself." (p. 278) Hogarth also puts the punctuation within the quotation marks, adding —at the same time—a comma after "thought": His father minded even more than he did, she thought, "being," she said, "nothing but a great boy himself." (p. 275) Virginia Woolf also tended to be cavalier in her use of the ellipsis mark; at times she recognized that additional punctuation was needed, but at other times she seemed to use three or four periods at will. Examples: So I thrust myself in—without an invitation. . . . (Hogarth, p. 258; Harcourt, p. 260) it was odd how standing there one felt them going on, going on, some quite old, some . . . (Hogarth, p. 257; Harcourt, p. 260) One scene after another at Bourton . . . (Proofs, p. 231; no correction indicated) One scene after another at Bourton. . . . (Hogarth, p. 231; Harcourt, p. 233) In spite of making some corrections, the Harcourt edition is still not perfectly consistent. For example, although Harcourt changes the proofs by adding a period on page 233 ("One scene after another at Bourton. . . ."), no terminal period is added on page 260 ("one felt them going on, going on, some quite old, some . . ."). An important area where the Harcourt and Hogarth editions frequently vary is in the use of blank lines to separate sections. Several of these section separations were added as revisions on the proof sheets. For Harcourt, these revisions provided no difficulty because Harcourt was setting its original type from the revised proofs; for Hogarth the revisions were fairly troublesome because they were made on page proofs not galley proofs. Nevertheless, the Hogarth first edition contains more space divisions (11) than does the Harcourt first edition (7). In three cases Harcourt is at fault, and all three seem to follow the same pattern. At the bottom of page 125 on the proof sheets, Virginia Woolf directed the printer to leave two lines white after "foo swee too eem oo". In the Harcourt edition (p. 124) there is no space division; in the Hogarth edition (p. 125) there is a space division, and, in addition, a period has been added after "foo swee too eem oo" (there is no period on the proof sheets, and Virginia Woolf did not indicate that one should be added). For Hogarth, the insertion of the blank space threw off the pagination, but Hogarth immediately regained the lost line by rearranging the two following paragraphs. The Harcourt edition (p. 125) follows the original type-set: "Poor old woman," said Rezia Warren Smith, waiting to cross. Oh poor old wretch! In the Hogarth edition (pp. 125-126) the sentences are altered so that only two type lines are taken up, rather than three: "Poor old woman," said Rezia Warren Smith. Oh poor old wretch! she said, waiting to cross. Similar problems occur on page 89 of the Hogarth edition. On the proof sheets, Virginia Woolf indicated that there should be a space division. The insertion of the blank line throws off the pagination in the Hogarth edition. After the space, the Hogarth edition has combined the two following paragraphs into one paragraph (Harcourt, page 88, follows the original type-set of the proof sheets and prints two separate paragraphs); strangely enough, this alteration does not save Hogarth any space. In the original type-set, the two paragraphs took up five lines of type; in the Hogarth first edition, the single paragraph also takes up five lines of type. It is not until after page 97 that Hogarth regains the original pagination of the proof sheets. The second instance in which Harcourt fails to insert a blank line although directed to do so occurs on page 142. Hogarth adds a blank line after "said Dr. Holmes, looking not quite so kind." In this instance, the insertion of the blank line was not problematic for Hogarth because considerable material was cut from the paragraph immediately following the space division. The original type-set reads: The leaden circles dissolved in the air. It was precisely twelve o'clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke, the wind being favourable, was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke wearing their bluepink fabric, and died up there among the seagulls Both Hogarth and Harcourt (p. 142) print the shortened form: It was precisely twelve o'clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke and died up there among the seagulls Harcourt, following Virginia Woolf's deletion instructions exactly, retains the comma before "and died". The third instance in which the Harcourt edition fails to insert a blank line occurs on page 228; Hogarth (p. 227) prints the blank after "So that was Dr. Holmes." The explanation of the three missing blank lines in the Harcourt edition seems to lie in the fact that in all three cases the blank lines should have appeared at the bottom of the page. Examination of the type-set on pages 142 and 228 of the Harcourt edition explains the omissions on these pages and probably also explains the omission on page 124. Pages 142 and 228 show fairly clearly that in the original setting of the type a blank line was included. Whereas the typical page in the Harcourt edition contains twenty-six lines of type, pages 142 and 228 contain only twenty-five lines; the printer has compensated for the "missing" line of type by inserting additional leading between the lines. Apparently, when the pages were proofed by Harcourt, the space at the bottom of pages 142 and 228 was viewed as a dropped line and thus "corrected." The same procedure might well have occurred on page 124, although it is not as obvious because of the single spacing of the lines of the song and the varying amount of leading which Harcourt inserts before and after the song on pages 122 and 124. Probably the most significant space division in the novel occurs on page 281 of the Hogarth edition, separating Clarissa's scene in the small room from the closing scene with Peter and Sally. The Harcourt edition does not have a space division (p. 284) because the page proofs do not have one and Virginia Woolf did not indicate that there should be one. Although Virginia Woolf's directions state that two lines should be left white for the divisions, both Harcourt and Hogarth standardly leave only one line blank. In two cases (pp. 99 and 281) Hogarth does leave two lines white, but the variation seems incidental rather than intentional. In both cases, the printer was helped when material was cut from the passages immediately before the break. On page 99 of the proofs, in the paragraph immediately before the break, the original type-set reads: "Clarissa!" as if something sharp-edged expanded in his chest and burst asunder. But she never came back. Both Hogarth and Harcourt follow Virginia Woolf's directions and remove "as if something sharp-edged expanded in his chest and burst asunder." On page 281 of the proofs, in the passage preceding the break, the original type-set reads: The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel the beauty; the fun. But she must go back. Harcourt (p. 284), following Virginia Woolf's directions, changes the second sentence to "He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun." In the Hogarth edition (p. 281), the entire sentence has been deleted. The deletion of the sentence on page 281 of the Hogarth edition represents the sixth major source of variants between the English and the American editions. The variants which have been discussed so far can be divided into five groups: 1.) directed changes which only Harcourt makes; 2.) directed changes which Harcourt fails to make but Hogarth makes; 3.) directed changes which Harcourt makes following the given directions on the proof sheets; Hogarth also makes changes but they are not identical to the ones indicated on the proof sheets; 4.) differing interpretations by Harcourt and Hogarth of what might have been identical, but confusing, directions; 5.) changes made by Harcourt on its own authority, including attempts— not always consistent—to correct or standardize Virginia Woolf's punctuation. The sixth source of variants is, in effect, the reverse of the first: Harcourt follows the original type-set of the page proofs (Virginia Woolf did not indicate that any changes should be made), while Hogarth makes changes. We have already seen some of these variants, mainly in respect to one space division and relatively minor marks of punctuation. Variants of this type are fairly numerous, the majority involving changes in punctuation; included in the list below are all of the major instances: Harcourt Edition, Following Type-set of Page Proofs Hogarth Edition coming down the stairs (p. 74) coming downstairs (p. 76) always about the place, totally unlike her, an attractive creature (p. 89) always about the place, an attractive creature (p. 91) Regent's Park Tube station (pp. 122 &amp; 123) Regent's Park Tube Station (pp. 123 &amp; 124) Would they let him off then, his torturers? (p. 148) Would they let him off then, Holmes Bradshaw? (p. 149) and Miss Kilman swelled and looked very plain. But then Miss Kilman (p. 198) and Miss Kilman swelled and looked very plain, but Miss Kilman (p. 198) listening with his hand up. But she heard nothing. And once they found the girl who did the room (p. 213) listening with his hand up. But she heard nothing. And once they found the girl who did the room (p. 212) when Clarissa grasped the hot water can, to think of her under this roof (p. 260) when Clarissa grasped the hot water can. To think of her under this roof (p. 258) But she did not know what it was— about Sir William (p. 278) But she did not know what it was about Sir William (p. 276) It was due to Richard; she had never been so happy. (p. 282) Odd, incredible; she had never been so happy. (p. 279) to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed. (p. 283) to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed alone. (p. 280) She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. (p. 283) She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away while they went on living. (p. 280) In examining the variants in the British and American editions of Mrs. Dalloway , it is difficult to decide which edition should be preferred. One tends to prefer the Hogarth edition partly because Virginia Woolf was able to exercise much closer control over its publication. Certainly, in the general question of punctuation, we must favor the Hogarth edition; even when the punctuation is inconsistent, at least it is Virginia Woolf's own inconsistency. Similarly, in the matter of the space divisions between sections, the Hogarth edition obviously reflects much more accurately Virginia Woolf's wishes. But, at the same time, because Hogarth had to revise type on page proofs in order to work in the additional space divisions, certain changes, such as those on pages 89 and 126 of the Hogarth edition, probably reflect more the needs of the printer than the desires of the author. In the cases involving substantive variants, one hesitates to say that either edition should consistently be preferred over the other. When Harcourt prints the original type-set version and Hogarth prints an altered version, we should probably favor the Hogarth edition on the assumption that the revision indicates that Virginia Woolf was not satisfied with the type-set version. Conversely, the same line of reasoning can be used to prefer the Harcourt edition in the passages where Harcourt followed Virginia Woolf's directions and changed the text from the type-set of the page proofs while Hogarth retained the original version. Clearly, while correcting the proof sheets for Harcourt, Virginia Woolf felt, at least at that moment, that she wanted the text altered. The fact that so many revisions, both major and minor, have been included in identical form in both the English and the American editions indicates that the revisions made on the proofs prepared for Harcourt were transcribed onto the proofs intended for Hogarth's printer. 4 At the same time, the variants suggest that the transcription was not overly systematic. If all of the variants involved additional changes in the Hogarth edition, then we might assume that they were all the result of later, more leisurely proof-reading. But, in the instances where Harcourt follows a revision while Hogarth retains the original type-set, it is difficult to imagine that Virginia Woolf transcribed the revision from Harcourt's set of proofs and then later voided the revision with a "stet." The instances are too numerous to support this explanation. When both Harcourt and Hogarth publish revised versions of the original type-set, but the revisions vary, we must judge each instance separately. On occasion, the revision given to Harcourt seems to be a mistake on Virginia Woolf's part—not really what she wanted; the Hogarth edition apparently "corrects" the revision. On other occasions it appears as though Virginia Woolf either changed her mind as she was transcribing the revision onto Hogarth's set of proofs or inadvertently transcribed the revision differently for Hogarth. It is possible, of course, that Virginia Woolf transcribed the revision exactly and then later, in reading the final proofs for Hogarth, revised the previously revised passage; but the fact that in the cases of the variant revisions Hogarth frequently retains more of the original type-set than does Harcourt seems clearly to suggest that the changes were made by Virginia Woolf while preparing the page proofs for Hogarth. Without the page proofs used by Hogarth before us, we can not state with assurance how and when certain variants came into the two editions. (Some variants might be the result of interpretations or misreadings on the part of Hogarth's printer.) Nevertheless, on the basis of a collation of the two first editions and an examination of the proofs used by Harcourt, we can at least evaluate the authenticity of the Harcourt edition and recognize the need of distinguishing between the Harcourt and the Hogarth versions of Mrs. Dalloway . At times, the differences are fairly substantial, and a critic quoting from one edition of the novel must be aware that the other edition of the novel might not contain the same passage or might contain it in a greatly altered form. Given Virginia Woolf's temperament, it is not surprising that the Harcourt and Hogarth editions—theoretically identical—are so different. While some of the variants are the result of Harcourt's editorial policy, the vast majority originated with Virginia Woolf herself. As her diary indicates, 5 Virginia Woolf disliked proofreading. In addition, she did not have what we might call a "factual" mind. A detail given on one page of the novel might be contradicted ten pages later. For example, both editions first describe Elizabeth's party dress as red (Harcourt, p. 287; Hogarth, p. 284); a few pages later, it fades into a pink (Harcourt, p. 295; Hogarth, p. 292). Similarly, we are first told that Peter Walsh, at fifty-three, is two years older than Hugh Whitbread (Harcourt, p. 112; Hogarth, p. 113); but later we are informed that Hugh "had been afloat on the cream of English society for fifty-five years" (Harcourt, p. 155; Hogarth, p. 156). Besides tending to be impatient with small details, Virginia Woolf was also a constant reviser, never completely satisfied with her own work. The page proofs reveal extensive revisions, and the variants between the Hogarth and the Harcourt editions suggest that if Virginia Woolf had been obliged to prepare a third set of "finally corrected" proofs for an Australian publisher, she would have made additional changes and we would have had a third version of the novel. As it is, we have two versions— both of which can legitimately claim to be authoritative first editions. 6</field>

Berg Collection, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. 3 In her diary entry for January 6th, 1925, Virginia Woolf, after commenting on the difficulties she encountered in writing Mrs. Dalloway , concludes: "Anyhow it is sent off to Clark's [Hogarth's printer], and proofs will come next week. This is for Harcourt Brace, who has accepted without seeing and raised me to 15 p.c." A Writer's Diary (1959), p. 71. 4 It is possible, of course, that Virginia Woolf first corrected the proofs intended for Hogarth's printer and then transcribed the revisions onto the proofs intended for Harcourt. The large number of revisions made only in the Harcourt edition indicates that she not only transcribed the revisions but also read Harcourt's set of proofs independently. If she corrected Hogarth's proofs first, in all probability she transcribed the revisions and then reread Harcourt's entire set of proofs, making additional changes which she did not add to the Hogarth proofs. After sending the revised proofs to Harcourt, she once again read the Hogarth proofs and made further changes. 5 A Writer's Diary , see pp. 49, 71, 103, 106, 173-174, and passim. 6 The Uniform Edition of Mrs. Dalloway , published by the Hogarth Press, is the commonly available English edition of the novel. It is actually the third English edition. A collation of the Uniform Edition and the first English edition reveals numerous variants, but since both the second edition (1942) and the third edition (1947) were published by Leonard Woolf after Virginia Woolf's death, both must be viewed as edited editions. Virginia Woolf herself supervised the publication of only the first editions. The Harcourt edition has never been re-set.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The aim of this article is to present a list of the press-variants revealed by collation of the nineteen copies of Q1 Othello (1622) included in the Bartlett and Pollard Census , 1 so that a scholar using one copy of the book may know how its text differs from the texts of the other eighteen copies. Since, however, the press-variants seem to provide evidence about the degree to which proofreading in Nicholas Okes's printing-house did or did not safeguard the transmission of the manuscript copy underlying the quarto, this article offers an interpretation of that evidence secondarily. Indeed, the strong probability—discovered by Dr. Alice Walker and further demonstrated by Professor Fredson Bowers 2 —that an annotated quarto served as copy for the Folio has made the degree of Okes's accuracy more crucial than ever to those who try to account for the correspondences and variants between the Q1 and Folio texts. Moreover, the evidence about proofreading indicates that the printshop's effect on the transmission of the text needs to be accounted for in more detail before it is safe to say, as Professors Nevill Coghill and E. A. J. Honigmann 3 have suggested in recent years, that some variants between the two substantive texts of Othello represent different stages of Shakespeare's thoughts, rather than the inaccuracies of scribes and compositors coupled with playhouse cuts in the quarto copy and some editorial interference in the Folio. Bibliographical descriptions of Q1 are to be found, of course, in Bartlett and Pollard's Census and in W. W. Greg's A Bibliography of English Printed Drama to the Restoration . To conserve space, here I merely list the nineteen copies, giving the Census number, the abbreviation used to refer to the copy in the table of variants, and the copy's location: (796) Bodl, Bodleian Library (797) MB, Boston Public Library (798) BM 1 , British Museum (799) BM 2 , British Museum (800) CLU-C, Clark Library, U.C.L.A.

Of the book's twenty-four formes—that is, the four-page groups that printed one side of a quarto sheet—nine contain press-variants.</field>

Uncorrected : Bodl N1:8 liquid ] liquit N1:19 liue ] loue Without considering kinds of bibliographical evidence beyond the scope of this study, one cannot determine with any certainty the method of printing employed in the quarto. 5 The consistency with which press-variants appear in only one forme of a sheet suggests, however, that Okes's shop may have followed a systematic order of work such as Professor Bowers has proposed was standard for two-skeleton books during the Elizabethan period. (Sheet I, the one sheet with press-variants in both the inner and outer formes, has in I(o) only a signature miscorrected and a battered 'e' replaced, sorts of correction that a pressman might initiate, according to Moxon. 6 ) The quarto, Hinman has established, used two skeletons (pp. 54-59), and the systematic method of printing described by Bowers may well account for the sheets showing uncorrected states in only one forme: the pressman would pull a proof and begin actual printing from the uncorrected type of the forme brought to press; when the pressman was forced to pause in the printing of forme one so that the compositor could correct the type in accordance with the corrector's marked proof, the pressman would pull a proof of uncorrected forme two but take up the edition-run again with corrected forme one; by the time the press-run of that forme was finished, corrected forme two would have been available to perfect all the sheets, forme two thus appearing in only one state while forme one might survive in variant states. 7 But whatever the method of printing employed by Okes, the quality of the proofreading and correction left much to be desired. Seven of the nine variant formes, all except H(o) and I(i), benefited little from stop-press correction. The change at B3:15 probably resulted from an accident at press, not from proof-correction; and the efforts to correct I(o) and L(i) may or may not have resulted from proofreading. Admittedly, the order of states of B(o) is not certain: the state showing 'How euer' at B3:15—that is, the state represented above as the earlier—has the reading required by the context and therefore might be regarded as a revised state; but as Hinman points out, the large number of copies in both states argues against deliberate revision, and the gummed catchword on B3 in the state reading 'Now euer' suggests its lateness, the variant probably the effect of careless replacement of a type accidentally pulled at press (p. 113). The state of I(o) with the signature 'I4' on I3 is definitely later than that with 'I5', for the corrector also replaced a damaged 'e' in 'newer' at I2 v :22, in the process displacing the 'a' in the same line. Confronted by four wrong page numbers on L(i), the corrector revised only two, neither of them correctly. The correct pagination on L1 v , L2, L3 v , and L4 would have been, respectively, 74, 75, 78, and 79: the page numbers in the unrevised state are 84, 85, 80, and 81 and in the revised state, 78, 77, 80, and 81. In formes B(o), I(o), and L(i), Okes's workmen bungled the corrections attempted, all relatively nonsubstantive errors whose detection would not have required proofreading. The remaining four of the lightly revised formes indicate proofreading very cursory in nature, the corrections not implying reference to copy. The first example of deliberate correction in the quarto, the change of 'Since' to 'Saunce' on C(i), probably restores the meaning of the copy, inasmuch as 'Saunce' was an acceptable spelling of the French sans required by the context. But neither that change nor the addition of ' Exit. ' at K2 v :20 is beyond the ability of an average reader. On G(o) the corrector merely righted an inverted 'r' and inserted a space between 'to' and 'me'. His corrections on N(o) were equally obvious, spelling 'liquid' rather than 'liquit' and changing 'loue' to 'liue' (where the sense of the latter word was clearly needed). If the proofreader did consult the manuscript in order to check any of the readings, his failure to correct more than one page per forme and more than one or two errors per page suggests that he was not systematically reading proof against copy, nor even reading proofs completely, since the corrected formes contain relatively numerous errors. C(i), for example, has the non-word 'reſterine' (C1 v :20), 'rhem' for 'them' (C3 v :12), and very illogical punctuation (allowing for Jacobean standards) in Brabantio's speech at the top of C4. The proofreader's very superficial and selective examination of C(i) and K(o) indicates that he sampled formes rather casually, making sure that there was no very large number of unsightly errors, except when he encountered deficiencies as obvious as those in uncorrected H(o), which caused him to take special pains. The large number of typographical errors in uncorrected H(o) probably accounts for its receiving more attention than any earlier forme, though its corrections, especially those in the first corrected state, do not imply reference to copy. This state revises only easily detected errors: substituting a 'k' for an 'l' to produce 'keepe', the word apparently required; inverting the upside-down letter in 'aud'; correcting a misspelling; eliminating one comma, and adding two others and an apostrophe. Indeed, as Hinman observes, the proofreader's emending 'Tis' to 'Let' provides strong evidence that he acted without consulting copy during the first stage of correction, for the erroneous 'Tis' probably originated from the compositor's misreading of 'Til', which appears spelled with two 'l's in the Folio (pp. 165-166). But, perhaps because the need to eliminate many obvious errors had made the proofreader more attentive, as well as determined to see that the errors he had marked had in fact been corrected, he read the forme again. The need for his first change, an added speech-prefix at H1:1, could only have been perceived if he had read the previous line, printed on G4 v , where the speech begins. Too late to put the speech-prefix in the proper place, he had it set before the speech's second line. Then, besides correcting the obvious error in 'Chamlerers', the reader changed three pronouns on H2 v which may or may not have required reference to copy. Again in I(i) the proofs received considerable attention, corrections being made not merely on one page, but on every page in the forme. Many of the corrections here set right obvious errors very similar in kind to those in the other corrected states: changing 'this' to 'the' (I1 v .10), substituting a period for a comma (I3 v :16), righting one wrong-font error (I3 v :19) and two inverted types (I3 v :37 and I4:34), providing a stage-direction implied by the text (I3 v :20), and eliminating repetition of a word (I3 v :31). But some of the proof-corrections in I(i) were different in kind from those in the other corrected formes. The proofreader rejected acceptable spellings in favor of optional spellings at I2:16 and I4:25. And, possibly, he marked changes in punctuation involving parentheses in ways misunderstood by the typesetter, whose changes in such punctuation produced nonsense at I2:26 and I3 v :5. Most importantly, the proofreader recovered the manuscript readings for two words in separate places whose contexts already made some sort of sense. The two alterations—'Conuinced' from 'Coniured' (I3 v :8) and 'vnfuting' from 'vnfitting' (I4:20) — provide the surest instances in the quarto of proofreading from copy, since both errors, especially the latter, would have been difficult to detect through the reading of only the printed proof. Incidentally, the two readings corrected by reference to copy illustrate sorts of errors compositors were likely to make, 'Coniured' representing a misreading and 'vnfitting' a memorial substitution. Clearly, the press-variants in I(i) reflect tendencies in proofreading not to be found in any of the other variant formes. Such unevenness in Okes's proofreading need not, however, imply a change in proofreaders. A proof-sheet from John Tichborne's A Triple Antidote , printed by Okes in 1609, shows the marks of a proofreader "rushed or uneven in fulfilling his task, so the workmen who followed his instructions did so imperfectly." 8 Of course, A Triple Antidote was printed thirteen years before Othello . Yet the man who desultorily examined the Othello proofs before forme H(o) may have become so alarmed at the errors discovered in that forme, first at the typographical errors and then, during the reading of the first corrected state, at some of the snarls in meaning, that he grudgingly devoted considerable attention to I(i), and perhaps to the substantially invariant formes H(i) and I(o), which may have been proof-corrected before their press-runs began. In any case, formes after I(i) show no extensive correction, and as Hinman's analysis of uncorrected errors in the quarto indicates, the composition in the late formes of the book allowed fewer obvious errors than in the early formes (p. 298). Whatever the identity of the man or men who proofread Q1 Othello , they seem to have exercised little control over the text's accuracy in matters of substance. Twenty-two of the book's twenty-four formes show little benefit from stop-press correction, and it is difficult to believe that the Okes shop read proofs antecedent to the corrected formes discussed here. If one wishes to assume that Q1 Othello went through what Professor D. F. McKenzie regards as the traditional minimum of three stages of proof-correction, then the press-variants are to be viewed as merely the last, but only surviving, stage of correction: "once the unique copy [manuscript] has been set and checked, it can be disposed of, once the single galley proof has been read and checked, it can be disposed of, once the revise has been read and checked, it can be disposed of, but once printing has started, the multiple copies are preserved and of course they are available for consultation in those portions of the edition still extant." 9 But it has been pointed out above that several conspicuous errors went uncorrected in C(i), perhaps because they appeared in pages other than C2, where the single correction took place. And, to cite only one more example, outer H after two stages of press-correction still contains two conspicuous errors—'valt [rather than vale ] of yeares' (H1:22) and 'Let vs be merry [rather than wary ]' (H3:29). That such errors could have survived not only the stage or stages of proofreading visible in the extant copies, but also the prior traditional stages of proofreading, is perhaps improbable. In Q1 Othello , as in most of the other Okes books examined thus far by bibliographers, the proofreading seems to have been intended mainly to prevent an excessive number of obvious errors, not really to transmit an accurate text. Authorities differ about the standard of proofreading implied by the elaborate press-corrections in the Pied Bull Lear (1608), Greg having pictured Okes as a printer who did not care as much about the accuracy of the text he was printing as about "the economical working of his business." 10 Professor Bowers, on the other hand, has seen in Lear indications "that Okes was doing his conscientious best to produce the best text he could from his miserable manuscript." 11 On the basis of the proof-sheet from A Triple Antidote , whose superficial and uneven correction agrees closely with most of the corrections in Othello , Professor Brown believes that Lear received much care, but that careful proofreading was atypical of Okes's printing-house. 12 The evidence provided by the press-variants in Othello is consistent with Professor Brown's assessment of Okes's methods, and with the conclusions of Professor Robert K. Turner, Jr., who has written several recent studies of books printed by Okes. Of Thierry and Theodoret (1621), Turner writes: "It was proofed primarily for mechanical rather than literary errors"; 13 and of The Maid's Tragedy (1619): "The total effect of the proofreading on the text of Q1 seems to have been very slight; the compositors were almost entirely responsible for the text as it now stands." 14 Since proofreading in Okes's shop evidently aimed at the detection of conspicuous typographical errors, leaving the responsibility for the text of Othello largely to the compositor or compositors, they may well have introduced a number of readings like the two in I(i) detected by the proof-reader when referring to copy, or more serious errors which make sufficient sense in context to prevent detection by the sort of proofreading employed in the greater part of the book. That even the reading of H(o) and I(i) was done with consistent care and more than sporadic reference to copy is certainly open to question. Without more knowledge about Okes's compositors, then, it is unwise to accept the corrections in I(i) as proof "that most of Q's errors were derived from Walkley's manuscript" 15 and much less wise to accept substantive variants between the Q1 and Folio texts as Shakespeare's first and second thoughts.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Norton the Printer: An Attribution (1622) by Wayne Franklin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seems reasonable, given his reputation as a man and a writer, that the New England minister John Norton (1606-1663) could have written An Answer to a Late Scurrilous and Scandalous Pamphlet (London, 1642), a brief anonymous work assigned to him in Donald Wing's Short-Title Catalogue . A hasty response to The Downfall of Old Common Councill Men , an attack on the city administration of London produced in the same year by one John Bond, An Answer quickly becomes the defense of established procedures and traditional prerogatives which one might expect the author of The Orthodox Evangelist (1654) and other such works to have made—as when it accuses Bond of possessing a "naturall inclination to rayle against Authoritie." 1 But Wing's attribution raises a number of unanswered questions—for one thing, the mechanics of Norton's procuring a copy of The Downfall from London and then sending his answer back in a brief time seem rather complicated. Wing sidesteps such issues, however, by resting his attribution solely on bibliographic evidence, mainly on the one great identifying mark on An Answer , a rebus on the title-page that is easily decipherable: enclosed in an ornate box is the word "Nor," standing above a keg or "tun." But in itself a rebus pointing to such a common name can offer only the vaguest suggestion of authorship, a fact which Wing's primary authority for anonymous works, the British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books , recognized in listing the pamphlet under Common Council Men: An Answer , simply noting that the title page bears a "rebus of Norton." Yet other sources, apparently those from which Wing's attribution was derived, are not so cautious. An earlier publication of the museum, the Catalogue of the "Thomason tracts," lists the work by its own title, but substitutes a bracketted "J. Norton" in place of a more strictly correct reference to the rebus. Likewise, Halkett and Laing, dropping the brackets, simply identify "J. Norton" as the author. 2 Assuming that Wing derived his own identification from these last two works, I would suggest either that his Norton and theirs are not the same man, or that both Wing and his sources err. My main reason for suggesting this view is the fact that there was another John Norton, a London printer who may have died before 1642 (his death date is uncertain), but whose firm, carried on by his family, was active at the time An Answer appeared. 3 The rebus, I would argue, is a printer's mark, not an indication of authorship. Bolstering this position is some typographical evidence linking the pamphlet with other Norton products. Specifically, the ornaments of An Answer —the type ornaments which form a border along the head of the first page, for example, are of exactly the same kind as those used in various other books printed by Norton. Composed of national symbols (the fleur-de-lis, etc.), and surmounted by crowns, these ornaments are prominent in such works as John Tatham's The Fancies Theater (STC 23704), Wilhelm Fabricius' Lithotomia Vesicae (STC 10658), and Richard Bernard's Common Catechisme (STC 1933), all of which Norton issued in 1640. 4 More conclusive than these border ornaments, however, is the presence in An Answer of an elaborate initial letter found in other Norton books. The Letter, a hollow-stemmed "T" surrounded by a floral design, contains enough defects to be identifiable, and it plainly was printed from the same piece of type as an initial "T" in William Barlow's Summe and Substance (STC 1456), printed by Norton in 1638. 5 The best way to verify this assertion is to compare the two letters visually; for the present purpose, however, a verbal description will suffice. In each letter the joint between the stem and the crosspiece points out a noticeable defect: for the hollow area just above the joint is slightly thinner than it is at either end of the crosspiece, the border of black ink at the head of the letter being thicker here than elsewhere. The base of the stem in each case also is irregular: the left-hand side rises toward the stem proper at a greater angle than does the right. All of this is admittedly technical, but when the letters in question are compared with example T1 and T4 in C. William Miller's "A London Ornament Stock: 1598-1683," printed in an earlier volume of Studies in Bibliography , it becomes clear that such defects can be used as the basis of defensible judgments. 6 A final piece of evidence gives further support to my argument. Although not evident from a simple examination of An Answer , the rebus on its title-page, despite its apparent vagueness, is actually a fairly conclusive identifying mark—for at least two other members of the Norton family employed similar devices. William Norton (1527-1593), who was master of the Stationers' Company for three terms, and who seems to have been John Norton's grandfather, used a "Nor"-tun device to which was added, for further identification, an emblematic sweet-william plant—and his son, Bonham Norton (1565-1635), also employed this same rebus. 7 It seems highly likely, in light of these earlier uses of the rebus, that its occurrence in the pamphlet of 1642 strengthens my attribution of that work to the press of John Norton or his associates and successors. The New England namesake of that London printer, by the same token, would seem to be a strange candidate indeed for the role of author. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 On Norton's character, see J. T. Adams' article on him in the DAB . Donald Wing, Short-Title Catalogue . . . 1641-1700 (1945-1951), lists An Answer among Norton's other works (see II, 493: N1314). The comment about Bond appears on p. 6 of An Answer . 2 Catalogue of the Pamphlets , Books , Newspapers, and Manuscripts . . . Collected by George Thomason , 1640-1661 (1908), and Samuel Halkett and John Laing, Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous English Literature (1926-1934)—s.v. "An Answer." 3 Henry Plomer states that Norton was active until 1645 (see A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England , Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667 —1907; rptd., 1968—p. 138). C. William Miller, on the other hand, states that Norton died "within a year or so" of 1639—see "A London Ornament Stock: 1598-1683," in Studies in Bibliography , 7 (1955), 133. 4 See Tatham, (*)4 v , 5 r , 8 r , 8 v ; A1 r , 2 r , 3 r ; Fabricius, (*)2 r ; Bernard, A3 r . In stating that the type ornaments in An Answer are of "exactly the same kind" as those used in these other books, I mean that they coincide in pattern, size, and usage—I have not, however, been able to discover whether any of those in An Answer were printed from the exact same pieces of type as those in other books known to have been produced by Norton's press. 5 The initial "T" appears in An Answer on p. 1; in Barlow, on A2 r . 6 Miller's T1 and T4 are initials of the same design and size, but they clearly were printed from two different pieces of type; they appear among several other illustrations in the unnumbered section inserted between pp. 136 and 137 in the article indicated in note 3 above. Miller's study deals with a group of ornaments and initials that descended from Thomas Judson (who began printing in 1586) through Norton and others to Robert White (who died in 1678). It is a good piece of bibliographical scholarship, but its identification of the books in which the ornaments and letters illustrated can be found is sometimes confusing: Miller says, for example, that the initial "T" in Barlow's book was printed from the piece of type represented by T4, but it and the initial in An Answer clearly were printed from the piece represented by T1. 7 R. B. McKerrow, Printers' and Publishers' Devices in England and Scotland , 1485-1640 (1913), reproduces two different states of the William Norton rebus (see illustrations 174 and 175). The books with the following STC numbers all use the device: 4422, 5478, 5480, 5481 (printed by Bonham Norton), 13784, 15016. 8 Jeri Smith of Yale University Library writes to me that in the revised edition of Wing's Short-Title Catalogue (1972— ) An Answer will be listed, on the basis of my findings, under "John Norton, London Printer."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Chief Substantive Editions of Oldham's Poems, 1679-1684: Printer, Compositors, and Publication by Harold F. Brooks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Oldham's second collection of poems, Some New Pieces , 1681, was 'printed by M. C. for Jo. Hindmarsh.' 1 M. C. is Mary Clark, successor of Andrew Clark. No other possible printer using these initials at this time is known to Plomer or to Wing. 2 Thanks to the Wing Index, it is now an easy matter to trace other books from the same printing-house in the years 1678 to 1684, and so to locate in Mary Clark's possession ornaments, initial capitals, and damaged letters employed in this and in the other four textually-significant volumes by Oldham published under Hindmarsh's imprint, and in the unauthorised Saytr Against Vertue , 1679. 3 A table, with its appended key, will spell out the evidence which assigns the printing of that piracy, followed by Satyrs Upon The Jesuits . . . And some other Pieces , 1681, (and its 'Second Edition more Corrected,' 1682), Some New Pieces , 1681, Poems , And Translations , 1683, and Remains of Mr. John Oldham , 1684, 4 all to Mary Clark's establishment. 5 Key. The Oldham editions, designated by initials and date (or as Works 84), are those already mentioned, with Some New Pieces , 1684, and Poems, And Translations , 1684, (Oldham, Bibliography Nos. II.9, 11) subjoined. The seven other volumes are: Ambroise Paré, The Works Of That Famous Chirurgeon, Ambrose Parey , translated . . . By Th. Johnson , 1678, Printed by Mary Clark for John Clark. Francis Bacon, Essays , 1680, Printed by Mary Clark for Samuel Mearne, John Martyn and Henry Herringman. Peter Heylyn, KEIMH^IA EKK^HΣTIKA. The Historical and Miscellaneous Tracts of Peter Heylyn , 1681, Printed by M. Clark for Charles Harper. Antoine Le Grand, Apologia Pro Renato Des-Cartes , 1679, Typis M. Clark impensis Jo. Martyn. Roger L'Estrange, The Case Put, Concerning the Succession Of His Royal Highness the Duke of York , 1679, Printed by M. Clark for Henry Brome. Paul Lathom, The Power of Kings from God , 1683, Printed by M. Clark for Joanna Brome. Izaak Walton, Love and Truth , 1680, Printed by M. C. for Henry Brome. The name or initials of Mary Clark, when given in brackets after the sigla, are taken from the imprints. In horizontal line with each volume are noted, either by signature or by 'Tp' for title-page, the places where items of evidence appear. In the vertical columns: The bowl of flowers is an elaborate ornament used on title-pages. The triangle of foliage (suitable for a tailpiece) occurs on internal title-pages. The minor ornament recorded in the third column looks like the bottom part of a medallion. The sprig of flowers (column four) is an unimpressive one on a small oblong, failing at the left-hand end to print sharply. It has, however, a special importance, because it enables one to distinguish at sight, from this true first edition, another edition, with a crowned rose on the title-page, which also bears the date 1683, but is in fact subsequent to the second edition, of 1684. 6 N1 may be seen as the initial capital to the text in A Saytr Against Vertue , 1679. N2 may be seen as the initial capital to the text of 'A Satyr Against Vertue,' in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. R1 is an R with damage at the foot of the upright: see the last letter of READER on H1 v of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. R2 is an R with damage at the foot of the upright and a gap at the top of the loop: see HORACE in the drop-title on A2 r of Some New Pieces , 1684. R3 is an R damaged where the loop should join the upright, both at the top and at the centre of the letter, so that there are only faint traces of ink between upright and loop at these points. It can be seen in SATYR on H1 r of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. In Heylyn's Tracts what may be R3 appears in DECLARATION on 3S2 r and 3T1 r . The types were evidently lifted from the first of these pages for use in the second. If this is R3, then it has made a somewhat less defective impression. R4 is an R with damage at the top of the loop, and midway down the outside of the upright, opposite the point where the bottom of the loop joins it. This R is found in drop-titles; for example on D8 v of Some New Pieces , 1681. S1 is damaged or malformed at the top: see the first S of SATYRS on the title-page of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682. S2, the first S of JESUITS on that title-page, has damage to the central curve. P is damaged a little above the foot of the upright; see POEM in the drop-title of 'A Satyr Against Vertue' on H2 r of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. To exemplify the use of the Table, one may consider Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. Here it records an ornament, an initial N (N2), two different damaged R's (R1 and R3) and a damaged P. It further shows the ornament, the initial, and R3, in volumes with 'Mary Clark', 'M. Clark', or 'M. C.' in the imprint. R1 is shown in Poems, and Translations , 1684, which in turn shares R3 with Parey's Works , 1678 ('by Mary Clark'), Heylyn's Tracts , 1681 ('by M. Clark'), and Walton's Love and Truth , 1680 ('by M. C.'), and yet another damaged R (R2) with Some New Pieces , 1684 ('by M. C.') and Lathom's Power of Kings from God , 1683 ('by M. Clark'). The P is shown in Poems, And Translations , 1683, which shares an ornament with L'Estrange's The Case Put , 1679 ('by M. Clark'), and a fourth damaged R (R4) with Some New Pieces , 1681 ('by M. C.'), Some New Pieces , 1684 ('by M. C.'), and with Lathom and Walton's volumes ('by M. Clark' and 'by M. C.'). Thus, directly or with one intervening link, five independent pieces of evidence indicate the printing of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, in Mary Clark's shop. A single piece might be explained away; five, of three different kinds, are irresistible. Satyrs Upon The Jesuits was Oldham's first collection of poems. Though the title-page is dated 1681, it was probably first issued by Joseph Hindmarsh in November or December, 1680. 7 It was advertised in the Term Catalogues for November, 1680; and its internal title-page for 'A Satyr Against Vertue, is dated 1680. That poem was set up from the pirated quarto of 1679: by Christmas 1680 Oldham is satirising Hindmarsh because in perpetuating the bad text he has 'exposed' the author—rendered him liable to public contempt. There were three isues of the edition: the copies described in my Bibliography or examined for it are or may be of the third issue, those which are perfect collating A 4 B-L 8 . It was not until 1971, while extending (in search of variant formes) my collation of copies, 8 that I discovered two of a first issue, which has no sheet L, and instead of including 'A Satyr Upon A Woman' ends with 'The Passion of Byblis', completed on the last page of sheet K. This issue is represented by the copy in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, and by one which I bought of the Bristol bookseller, A. R. Heath (it has the bookplate of Walter Wilson). Both are perfect, and in the original binding. Even before they were observed, the existence of a first issue might have been suspected from two features in the other copies of the first edition, which it explains. In his 'Advertisement', in all copies, Oldham writes of 'Byblis' as the last poem and does not go on to mention 'A Satyr Upon A Woman'; and in those which conclude with that satire, 'FINIS' appears twice: at the end of the full text, and after 'Byblis' where, as we now know, it originally ended. The next step was to add 'A Satyr Upon A Woman', which occupies the first six leaves of a new sheet, sheet L. The augmented volume was issued with the last two leaves, L7 and L8, blank. This second issue is represented by the copies in the Guildhall Library in London, and the W. A. Clark Memorial Library, Los Angeles. The Birkbeck, British Museum, and New-berry copies, which lack these leaves, may belong to this issue, since leaves are more likely to be lost when blank. Oldham then became aware that in this authorised volume, the bookseller, Hindmarsh, who employed the printer, had used for the text of 'A Satyr Against Vertue' the 1679 piracy, so that it remained riddled with corruptions. The pirated quarto (as we have seen) was printed by Mary Clark; a fact which, with the sequel, strongly suggests that Hindsmarsh was the publisher concerned in the piracy. If this were so, and Oldham knew it, his grievance against Hindmarsh was now double. In his 'Advertisement', or preface, to the 1681 volume, he had declared as his reason for including this 'Satyr' the provision of a correct text: it was a justice done to his own Reputation, to have it come forth without those faults, which it has suffer'd from Transcribers and the Press hitherto, and which make it a worse Satyr upon himself, than upon what it was design'd. (pp. [6 f.]; A3 v , A4 r ) Yet the text thus introduced, he discovered, was little better than a perpetuation of the one stigmatised, repeating or miscorrecting all but half-a-dozen of its bad readings. Little wonder that he composed a vitriolic satire (dated 'Christmas 1680 Rygate', and running to nearly a hundred lines) 'Upon a Bookseller that expos'd him by Printing a Piece of his grosly mangled and faulty.' When this was published in the second issue of Some New Pieces , 1681, 'Bookseller' was changed to 'Printer'. 9 Just conceivably, I suppose, Hindmarsh in the interim had convinced the satirist that the responsibility for taking the bad quarto as copy-text lay in Mary Clark's shop. But more probably, since Hindmarsh was the publisher of the book in which the satire appeared, the change in the title was made in order to shield him. 10 The printer was a convenient scapegoat: his reputation was not, like the bookseller's, exposed face-to-face with the reading public. The further consequence of Oldham's indignant discovery was a third issue of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, in which L7 r , formerly blank, carries a list of errata. Fifty out of the sixty-seven pertain to 'A Satyr Against Vertue'; the remainder to 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits'. To this third issue belong the two copies in the Bodleian (Antiq.e.E.1681/3 and Godwyn Pamph. 1618(10)), one each in the Cambridge University Library (CCD.3. 3) and the Huntington Library, the two at Austin (Texas), and one of my two copies. The errata are of major textual, as well as of bibliographical, importance, for they are undoubtedly authorial. If they were not, their source would have to be editorial guesswork, or an earlier printed edition, or a MS. deriving from private circulation. Apart from the bad quarto, where nearly all the corruptions in the 1681 Satyrs Upon The Jesuits themselves originate, the only previous publication of 'A Satyr Against Vertue' was in the unauthorised Poems on Several Occasions by the E. of R. (which I shall refer to as Rochester , 1680). 11 Though this is not without correct readings where the bad quarto, and (following it) the text in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , are astray, it would not have made possible the corrections in at least eleven of the errata: those for p. 97, l. 7; p. 99, l. 14; p. 104, l. 6; p. 105, ll. 4 and 13; p. 109, l. 10; p. 112, ll.8 and 11; p. 113, ll. 2 and 18; and p. 119, l. 1. 12 Evidently some of the MSS. in circulation were better than the one from which the 1679 quarto was printed, and further evidence of that is supplied by B. M. Additional MS. 14047 (which I shall call MS.A), and the MS. formerly H. M. Margoliouth's, which he designated 'm'. 13 But each of these has errors where the 1681 errata restores readings authenticated by Oldham's autograph fair copy. 14 At p. 112, l. 8 ('Satyr', l. 231), 'Examples', the erratum, is shared only by the autograph: 'example,' common to MSS.m and A, and to Rochester , 1680, the 1679 quarto, and Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, does not announce itself as wrong, and would not be suspected by a corrector unless he was collating with authentic copy, or was the author. Similarly at p. 105, l. 13 ('Satyr', l. 137), though there the bad quarto has the obvious corruption 'claim' for 'calm', neither 'Her quiet calm and peace', in the other two printed texts and MS.m., nor, in MS.A, 'For calm and quiet peace' would be suspicious in itself; but the erratum restores the awkward reading of the autograph: 'Her Quiet and Calm and Peace'. It is possible that from 'Bards', p. 104, l. 6 ('Satyr', l. 113), the nonsensical reading of the 1679 and 1681 editions, 'Beards', might have been guessed. Yet Oldham's word had defeated those responsible for the texts of Rochester , 1680, MS.m, and MS.A: the first with 'Birds', has a shot at the look of it, the second and third, with 'Lawes' and 'Morals', try to deduce the meaning from the context. The correct word is again shared only by the errata-list and the autograph. Forty-six of the errata to 'A Satyr Against Vertue' restore the original reading of the autograph fair copy: a result no editorial guesswork, whether at the bookseller's or the printer's, would have achieved. Three of the remaining four 15 are particularly clear revelations of the author at work. In the 'Apology' for 'A Satyr Against Vertue' on p. 72 (Apology, p. 119, l. 1), the 1679 and 1681 editions, instead of an epithet for 'Wit', have a hiatus, the result of a copyist's inability to recognise the rare word 'tuant', Oldham's first choice of epithet as the autograph shows. 16 Equally baffled, the copyist of Rochester , 1680, has 'angry wit', and MS.m (quite desperately) 'curse'. The erratum, 'pointed', is, however, not yet another effort in the dark: it is Oldham's revised reading, which he wrote in the margin of the autograph copy. As here for p. 119, l. 1, so also for p. 113, l. 2, (Apology, l. 260), the erratum introduces a revision made in the margin of the autograph, where 'down' is marked for insertion. This time both the revised and the unrevised phrase had got into circulation. MS.A and Rochester , 1680, have 'Plantations below', the 1679 and 1681 editions (corruptly) 'Plantation below'; but MS.m, like the erratum, 'Plantations down below'. In the erratum for p. 112, l. 11 (l. 254), we find Oldham, it seems, in the very act of revising. The autograph reads: 'Unthought, unknown, unpattern'd', and so do the 1679 and 1681 editions, Rochester , 1680, and MS.m (for 'unpattern'd, MS.A has 'unpractic'd', probably an authentic, still earlier, reading). But though there is no error in this reading, the erratum changes it to 'Unknown, unheard, unthought of'—something that in a list of errata no one but the author would do. The errata to the 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' are equally authoritative. Some restore a harder reading: 'made' for 'make', 'write' for 'writ', 'shamelessness' for 'shamefulness' (p. 49, ll. 2, 8, 14). 17 The obvious 'there' for 'these' (p. 2, l. 19) 18 agrees with an autograph draft (MS.R, p. 174). In two instances (p. 25, l. 3, p. 30, l. 2) 19 the word in the Errata gives the true sense, indicated in a draft, and is yet so near in form to the wrong reading in the text as to make the misprint easy to understand. For 'plagues' and 'name', Oldham's first thoughts (MS.R, pp. 188, 191), he must have substituted, in the MS. he sent to press, 'curse' and 'Title', which were misprinted as ' cure ' and 'little': the errata evidently restore the reading of that MS. Finally, no one correcting by the mere light of nature would have suspected corruption in l. 18 on p. 35: 'Than Bullies common Oaths and canting Lies?' 20 Yet 'canting' is changed to 'bant'ring' in the Errata, and 'bantring' is also the word in two autograph drafts (MS.R, pp. 193, 281). It is possible that both readings are Oldham's: he was evidently dissatisfied with his epithet; among his revisions in the second edition, Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, his alteration of this line gets rid of it: 'Than a Town-Bullie common Oaths, and Lies?'. The 1682 edition incorporates in its text the errata from the third issue of the 1681; and since fresh revision shows Oldham still at work in that text, 21 the adoption of the errata is a further confirmation of their authenticity. As set up for the first issue, Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, was the work of two compositors, readily distinguishable by their different habits in the use of italics. One, because he is lavish with them, I designate compositor L; the other, who had the major share of the book, compositor M. Being familiar with Oldham's orthography in his fair copies, I have always attributed to the printing-house the style of italicisation, very different from his, in portions of the book, though I did not in the 1930's recognise them as distinctive of a particular compositor who had set only certain sections. Not only does L italicise words which M would not; he has a distinctive trick of italicising phrases. The same style is observable in L'Estrange, The Case Put , (first edition) 1679, printed, we remember, by M. Clark for Henry Brome. A characteristic example from Satyrs Upon The Jesuits runs: Where never poching Hereticks resort , To spring the Lye, and mak't their Game and Sport . But I forget (what should be mention'd most) Confession our chief Priviledge and Boast . 22 with the unexpected and apparently capricious italics of ' mention'd ', and of ' Boast ' when 'Priviledge' is in roman; and with the italicised phrase, ' poching Hereticks resort '. One can compare, from p. 4, of The Case Put : 'he very fairly, and for brevity sake, sweeps all together . By the Character of the First Publisher , we may Imagine the Intent of That Publication '; and from p. 3, ' Presidents, ready made to your hand (like Cloaths in a wholesale Shop ) of all Sizes and Colours '. Similar italicisation is seen in Paul Lathom's The Power of Kings from God , printed by M. Clark for Joanna Brome, 1683. Two samples will suffice: from p. 23, 'So that it appears that changing the Bed will not give ease to the sick person , nor will the change of Government please those that are resolved not to be pleased '; and from p. 39, 'Which should move us rather to assist them with our Prayers . . . than to suggest in sly and slanderous whispers to the Rabble , that they are always erring'. It looks as though Compositor L of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits were Mary Clark's compositor who set the pieces by Lathom and L'Estrange. 23 The second, or main compositor, M, reserves italics for proper names, and a few other emphatic words, often of religious connotation: ' begging Friers ', ' Hereticks ', 'The Birth and Passion ', for example. 24 Italicised phrases of three or four words together, not being proper names, are absent from his work. ' Pernicious Knowledge gets ', ' Cordials to prolong their gasping Life ', ' Capricious , Headlong , Fickle , Vain ', and the like, are frequent in L's: thirty and more italicised words on a page are not beyond him. 25 Once the distinction between him and M has been noticed, his pages leap to the eye. They are all in 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', comprising the whole of sheets B and C, and sections of D and E: the other poems were set entirely by Compositor M. Besides the contrast in the italics, a further typographical feature differentiates him from L, though this additional evidence is less simple. In the stints assigned by the italic test to L, verselines too long for the compositor's measure are dealt with, twenty times out of thirty, by a turn-up or a turn-down. In the stints similarly assigned to M, this method is used only seven times out of forty-one; and those seven are all in the first six pages he set. 26 After that, in his share of the 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', normally he gives the overflow a line to itself, spaced out with leading above and below. The change probably marks the point at which he saw he must spread out his matter if 'Satyr IV' were to stretch to G8 v . But while this explains his giving his overflows the same spacing as complete verse-lines, that is not the whole story. When, locally, on E5 r , he is not anxious to lose space 27 he still uses an overflow, but without leading; and outside his allotment for 'Satyrs Upon the Jesuits', he uses not turn-overs, but what I take to be his normal preference, an overflow with no leading above, between it and the line it belongs to, but with leading between it and the next line below. Significantly, in setting from A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679, he changes its turn-overs into overflows of this form. It occupies, of course, a line less than the form he had been using in the 'Satyrs upon the Jesuits', but perhaps at this stage his need to lose space was fully met by the inner title-leaves (for which see below) without extra contribution from the overflows. The contrast of M's practices with L's is all the stronger because at least four out of L's ten instances of overflows, instead of his customary turn-overs, are accounted for by special circumstances. 28 It was the 'Satyrs upon the Jesuits' themselves, as we noted, that were shared between the two compositors. 29 They occupy the first six sheets of the text (excluding the preliminaries). Four of the sheets present no problem: Compositor L set B and C; Compositor M set F and G. Sheets D and E, however, each divided between the two workmen, demand more analysis. L's characteristic italics appear in the first six pages of Sheet D—D1 r to D3 v ; and in ten pages of E—E2 r to E4 v , and E6 v to E8 r (the last five pages of the sheet). They appear, too, (and with a turn-down) in the first five lines of E5 r , but not in the remainder of the page. In sheet D, it is clear that L continued his setting of Satyr II, begun in sheet C, for the six pages needed to finish it, and that M began at the beginning of ' SATYR III . Loyola's Will '., and continued with it to the end of the sheet. In this sheet, one's eye is caught by the headlines, which differ from those in sheets B, C, F, and G, and exhibit anomalies among themselves. In the other four sheets, apart from the headline to the Prologue, the versos are all headed ' SATYR I .' (or II, III, or IV as the case may be), and the rectos ' upon the Jesuits.' Now we have, in a larger swash italic, ' SATYR II .' on D1 v , D2 v , D3 v , D4 v ; ' SATYR III .' on D5 v , D6 v , D7 v , D8 v . With the exception of D4 r , which bears the drop-title of ' SATYR III . Loyola's Will .', the recto headlines run: D1 r ' upon the Jesuits .'; D2 r , D3 r ' upon the Jesuites .'; D5 r , D7 r and D8 r 'Loyola's Will .' The headline on D4 v , ' SATYR II .', is wrong: the text below is part of Satyr III. On D6 r , ' upon the Jesuits .' is not wrong, but it is anomalous, because all other recto headlines to this satire appear as 'Loyola's Will .' The anomalous headline is the first that compositor M had to set for a recto of the Inner forme. Presumably he had begun by composing the two whole sheets allotted to him, F and G, and now continued with the wording he had used there, before changing on D8 r to 'Loyola's Will .' The 'Loyola's Will .' of D5 r , though in the perfected and folded sheet it precedes the anomalous headline, belongs, of course, to the Outer forme. Provided the Inner forme was printed before the Outer, the 'Loyola's Will .' headlines, once begun, follow each other in unbroken series so far as the order of composition and printing are concerned. That the Inner did precede the Outer forme, there is yet stronger evidence in the headline of D4 v : ' SATYR II .' The text on that page is part of Satyr III: the headline is wrong. Evidently it was let stand from D1 v of the Inner forme. Significant also is the variation in spelling from ' upon the Jesuits .' on D1 r and D6 r , to ' upon the Jesuites .' on D2 r and D3 r . If one compositor set the whole skeleton for either forme, or if compositor L set all the headlines for all the pages of which he composed the text, then without assignable reason he varied between Jesuites and Jesuits . But if each compositor set, in the Inner forme, the headlines for his own type-pages, and the skeleton thus produced for the Inner was then used with the minimum of change for the Outer forme, all the anomalies are accounted for. As a hypothesis which fits the facts we have, I therefore suggest that for the Inner forme compositor L set ' SATYR II .' on D1 v ; ' upon the Jesuites .' on D2 r and ' SATYR II .' on D3 v ; while compositor M set the drop-title, ' SATYR III : Loyola's Will .' on D4 r , ' SATYR III .' on D5 v , ' upon the Jesuites .' on D6 r , ' SATYR III .' on D7 v , and 'Loyola's Will .' on D8 r . Tabulating the impositions for the two formes, we can see how every headline but two could be left standing as a skeleton for D Outer. TABLE II. Imposition of Skeletons for Sheet D of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681. D Inner D Outer Originally set by D2 r upon the Jesuites . D3 r upon the Jesuites . L D7 v SATYR III . D6 v SATYR III .

M D4 r Drop-title: D1 r upon the Jesuits . M SATYR III : Loyola's Will . All that was necessary was to transfer ' upon the Jesuits .' from D6 r to D1 r , and to supply the gap with 'Loyola's Will .', either set afresh, or more likely taken from the drop-title on D4 r . The D1 v headline was wrongly left standing for D4 v , probably by oversight, or if not, from a resolve to get the whole of the Outer skeleton from the Inner one. Inner D would be ready a page ahead of Outer D, the pages within each of the two stints being set in the order of the text. This was not the order in which Sheet E was set. The evidence consists of a shortage of capital W's, and consequent recourse to VV's 30 in the later pages of each compositor's work, taken together with the indication that the two men met on E5 r . Since in Sheet D six pages (to finish Satyr II ) were given to L, and ten to M, it is not surprising that these figures were reversed in Sheet E. Two stints of three pages each were evidently expected from Compositor M, and two, of five each, from Compositor L. For his first stint, M had only to continue straight ahead with the text of Satyr III , as he had been doing in Sheet D. He set E1 r , E1 v , and E2 r , without any lack of W's. Compositor L had two runs, E2 v -E4 v , and E6 v -E8 v . The latter shows no shortage of W's until the final page; there is shortage on three pages of the former. I suggest that L began with the last five pages of the sheet: the shortage developed at the end of this stint and continued in the other: though while he was composing that, a few more W's became available. The hypothesis receives support when we look at the distribution of his W's and VV's in detail: one can form a consistent explanation of it. He used his last W, and resorted to one VV, on E8 v . On his next page, however, he required no VV's, and was able to set three W's. This cleaned him out again; on E3 r he has no W's and four VV's. For E3 v a solitary W was again to hand, supplemented by one VV. He must then have acquired three W's more, since two (and no VV's) appear on E4 r , and one remained over for E4 v , where a VV was needed in addition. The fresh W's came no doubt from type-pages distributed on three occasions during the shortage. No combination out of L's six in Sheet D would have released W's in the sequence (three, one, and three) which is necessary in order to explain the facts. Outer D, indeed, would still be on the press. But distribution of the last three pages from Outer C would yield exactly what the compositor obtained: C8 v providing three, C7 r one, and C6 v a further three. Meanwhile M, too, in his second stint, ran out of W's. Assuming that he started with the page before the five already set at the end of the sheet, by L, and worked backwards, all becomes clear. On E6 r he needed only one W, which he had. This left him with one and no more for E5 v , where he followed it with three VV's. Reaching E5 r , he took over from Compositor L, whose italics and turn-down are seen in the first five lines (probably a stick-full); and having no W's he was obliged to use two VV's in his share of the page. One can tabulate the work of the compositors on the two sheets so as to give a rough idea of their simultaneous progress, and how they could come together on E5 r . Compositor L: D1 r , D1 v , D2 r , D2 v , D3 r , D3 v ; E6 v , E7 r , E7 v , E8 r , E8 v ; E2 v , E3 r , E3 v , E4 r , E4 v , E5 r Compositor M: D4 r , D4 v , D5 r D5 v , D6 r , D6 v , D7 r , D7 v , D8 r , D8 v ; E1 r ; E1 v , E2 r ; E6 r , E5 v , E5 r Three of the formes they set are known in an uncorrected and a corrected state. In Outer D, 'Call', 'Impluicit', 'thousand' (D3 r , p. 37), ' Genevah 's' (D4 v , p. 40), 'Cononical' (D7 r , p. 45), 'ro' (D8 v , p. 48) are changed to 'tale', 'Implicit', 'thousands', ' Geneva 's', 'Canonical', 'to'. The uncorrected readings are found in B.M. 11632.aaa.28, Bodley Antiq.e.E. 1681/3, and my second copy; the corrected, in my copy of the first issue, and ten others: Bodley G.Pamph. 1618 (10), Cambridge University Library CCD.3.3, Trinity College Cambridge, Birkbeck College (London), the Guildhall (London), Yale, Huntington, Newberry, W. A. Clark (Los Angeles) and Austin (Texas). In Outer E, 'may' (E1 r , p. 49) is changed to 'make'. Five of the copies examined have the corrected state: Bodley G.Pamph.1618 (10), Cambridge University Library CCD.3., Birkbeck College, Yale, and my second copy. The uncorrected state is represented by my copy of the first issue, and by BM.11632.aaa.28, Bodley Antiq.e.E. 1681/3, Trinity College Cambridge, Guildhall, Huntington, Newberry, and W. A. Clark. I have seen only one copy, Newberry, with the uncorrected state of Outer G, which on G2 v has two turned letters: in the twelve other copies examined, 'wight', 'aud' have been corrected to 'might', 'and'. Throughout this series of uncorrected readings, error or abnormality and the required correction are obvious in all but two; their detection and correction do not raise the question of reference to copy, still less of proofs submitted to the author. 'Call' is more interesting. It yields a sort of sense, and might have escaped notice had attention not been drawn to it because Compositor L had omitted the space between it and the preceding word. It is evidently his misreading of 'Tale' in the MS., which may have been consulted for the correction, though a good guess may have sufficed. Certainly 'make' for 'may' (p. 49) is a guess, showing that the MS. copy was not consulted by the proof-reader at that point. Oldham's phrasing, vouched for by an erratum, 31 was somewhat difficult: So Rome 's and Mecca 's first great Founders did, By such wise Methods made their Churches spread with a distinct pause after 'did', and 'Founders' as the subject of 'made' ('This was what Rome's and Mecca's first great founders did—they made their churches spread by wise methods of this kind'). This construction, it seems, was more than Compositor M could follow; intending to reduce the second line to sense, he reduced the argument to nonsense: By such wise Methods may their Churches spread. Noticing the absurdity, the proof-reader miscorrected it by a guess which restored the author's meaning, but not his syntax; he emended 'may' to 'make', assuming it depended upon 'did': So Rome 's and Mecca 's first great Founders did, By such wise Methods made their Churches spread. After the first issue we have been examining, the next step was to add 'A Satyr Upon A Woman'. The addition of Sheet L, with that satire occupying its first six leaves, is what constitutes the second issue. Typographically, the new piece is identical in style with 'Byblis', which it immediately follows, and may be presumed the work of Compositor M; certainly Compositor L's characteristics nowhere appear in it. 'A Satyr Upon A Woman' was written 'Whitsuntide 1678,' 32 and so was available for inclusion in the first issue of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, had it been so decided. When Oldham wrote his 'Advertisement', as we have seen, he envisaged no poem to follow 'Byblis'. But the title-page, in the first as well as in the other issues, did imply at least one. For it announced, besides 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' and 'A Satyr Against Vertue', 'Some other PIECES by the same HAND'; pieces, not merely the one piece, 'Byblis'. Probaby, then, to include 'A Satyr Upon A Woman' was not an afterthought; rather, the intention was waived in order to delay the publication of the topical satires on the Jesuits. This would explain why Compositor M, who set the whole of the last five sheets of the book, seems, in the four which belong to the first issue, short of copy to fill what was no doubt his allotted space. I suspect the problem was realised by the time he began to set the fourth of the 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', which by comparison with its predecessors is anomalously treated. 'Satyr III' ends on F5 r , and if the parallel instance of the end of 'Satyr I' were followed, 'Satyr IV' would begin on the verso. That, however, is left blank, and F6 r devoted to a half-title, such as none of the other 'Satyrs' has, with the verso again blank; so that three pages are deliberately lost. This, it is true, enables the 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' to finish on the last page of sheet G, and that may be the only reason why it was done. But though, in sheets H, I, and K there is nothing obviously anomalous, space is treated in similarly lavish fashion. Both the poems concerned, 'A Satyr Against Vertue' and 'The Passion of Byblis', are begun after leaving a verso blank, and each is given a title-leaf. Again this fits them exactly into the three sheets. Yet one cannot help thinking that the compositor's policy here and at the start of the fourth 'Satyr Upon The Jesuits' might have been different if he had had all the copy he expected. On his blank leaves, half-title, and internal titles, he has expended nine pages; nine pages, before the end of sheet K, which would have been saved if he had set the Fourth Satyr Upon The Jesuits, 'A Satyr Against Vertue', and 'The Passion of Byblis' without blanks and with drop-titles only. These pages approximate very fairly to the space 'Upon a Woman' would have occupied in sheet K had it been set in that same style; for the drop-title and text of it, when eventually printed on L2 r to L6 r for the second issue, occupied nine pages and five lines. The additional lines could have been accommodated without difficulty in the space available in the first issue, if on G4 v to G6 v , and G7 v , in the Fourth Satyr Upon The Jesuits, Compositor M had dropped the use of leading between an overspill and the line it continued; and adopted, saving a line each time, the practice he follows in the succeeding poems, in sheets H-K (see above). One conclusion, at least, important to the editor and biographer of Oldham, is plain: the anomaly of the half-title to the fourth 'Satyr Upon The Jesuits' was initiated in the printing-house and not before. It does not reflect any peculiarity either in the MS. from which the 'Satyr' was printed, or in the circumstances of its delivery to the publisher: it does not, for instance, as I once inclined to think, point to Oldham's having supplied it later than the MS. of the other three. After Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, in the four further volumes of Oldham printed by Mary Clark (namely Some New Pieces , 1681, Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, Poems, And Translations , 1683, and Remains , 1684), Compositor L's style of italicisation does not recur. Nor can I establish that any of them was divided between different workmen. In Remains , 1684, it is true, there are some signs, at bibliographically significant points, that this might be so. One copy ( Works, Together with . . . Remains , 1684, Bodleian 12 θ 1868) has an early state of G Outer which shows error where the text is divided between that forme and G Inner and H Outer. 33 G Inner ends correctly on G8 r with the catchword 'III. Hence': the number of the stanza which should follow, and the first word of its first line. But instead of beginning, as would be correct and consistent, with 'III.', then a line of leads, and the first line of the stanza, G8 v begins with the stanza's second line. This gain of space, by omission, is matched at the foot of the page by the inclusion of three lines which are also set at the top of H1 r . As a result, the G8 v catchword, correct for the line which should follow the three at the foot of that page, corresponds not with the first but with the fourth line on H1 r . The mistake in the division of the text is most simply explained if it occurred by simple omission at the top of G8 v . The compositor would then get three lines more on the page than had been allowed for, and if the new sheet, H, were begun at the point predetermined by casting-off, the duplication of those three lines would be the outcome. If we were forced to envisage a compositor, having set three lines a first time, immediately setting them again, in circumstances which rule out mere dittography, we might think such an error improbable, and seek to attribute the second setting to a second workman. But at the completion of a forme, and especially of a sheet, it would be normal for setting to be interrupted by other tasks: imposition, locking-up, perhaps distribution of type; and the error of duplication would be easy enough for the original compositor returning to the copy after an interval. I have failed to find in the orthography or typography of the sheets, formes, and pages in question anything that might reflect a change of compositor. Two other sheets, B and C, do contrast in a single typographical feature with the rest of the book, including G and H. Except twice (on F1 v , G4 v ) only B and C have turn-overs: the remaining sheets have overflows, unleaded above, leaded below (like those of sheets H-L in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681). In sheet B such overflows are a minority, and in sheet C there are none. Instead, there are turn-downs, and one turn-up. The turn-up is of the regular space-saving kind, tucked in at the end of the preceding line of print. But the turn-downs are of a form not found in Mary Clark's substantive editions of Oldham apart from this one. They require exactly the same amount of space as the overflows just described, for each is given a line to itself, unleaded above, but leaded below. This peculiarity of Sheets B and C is not supported, however, by any other. The orthography appears consistent throughout the Remains . The two turn-downs in the later sheets are of the same rather odd sort as those in B and C. I can see no signs of adjustment which might mark the end of a stint, except in G8 v , where that does not appear the likeliest explanation. In short, even for the two sheets B and C, it is hard to believe that a second compositor was employed in Remains , 1684, though the possibility cannot be altogether discounted. Nowhere else in the editions under consideration—nowhere in Some New Pieces , 1681, Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, or Poems, And Translations , 1683—is there (so far as I can detect) a peculiarity correlated with one or more of the constituent bibliographical units, such as would suggest that the task of setting-up had been divided. We have now to investigate the patterns of compositorial preferences in these four texts, and, necessarily, to bring into the comparison Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, and A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679. For the patterns have to be compared not only with each other, but with Compositor M's; and in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, M can be studied as he sets from the Satyr , 1679. From the comparisons we may form some opinion about the presence or absence, in the four later volumes, of M or other workmen. We have two great advantages. We can follow the compositor of the Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, in precise detail, as he sets from the first edition, merely incorporating a number of authorial corrections (some from the 1681 errata). And with one exception, 34 wherever the texts are being set from MS. we can observe the features that coincide with the practice of the author, which is known from about a hundred-and-thirty pages of rough drafts, and about ninety of holograph fair copies, in the Rawlinson MS. 35 None of the features is so idiosyncratic as to prove beyond a pedant's cavil that the printer's copy was autograph, but there is not the least reasonable doubt that it was. The notion of Oldham, never prosperous, and capable of handsome fair copy, deciding instead to employ a scribe (who must, if he existed, have had the same pattern of spelling as Oldham himself) is patently ridiculous. 'A Satyr Against Vertue' was never printed from autograph, because the 1679 edition was pirated from a corrupt MS. in circulation, and the reprints in 1681 and 1682 (the first, with errata in the third issue of the book; and the second with a corrected text) were each set up from the previous edition. Everywhere else in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, and everywhere in Some New Pieces , 1681, Poems, And Translations , 1683, and, I believe, in Remains , 1684, we are safe in assuming autograph copy, and examining compositorial practice by the help of a general comparison with Oldham's. For six poems, distributed among the first three of these volumes, the comparison can be more specific; for although we do not possess the MSS. actually sent to the printer, these are unlikely to have departed much in accidentals from the autograph fair copies extant in the Rawlinson MS. 36 The first step is to note those details of Oldham's spelling and punctuation which will be needed for our comparisons. His fair copies are punctuated carefully but not heavily. He is fond of such doublets as 'Life &amp; name,' 'remote &amp; wide,' 'Pollute &amp; soil,' and rarely divides them by a comma. He seldom fails to mark metrical elision, but occasionally uses a notation of Cowley's and Jonson's, retaining 'e' along with the apostrophe in a slurred syllable: 'Reve'rence', 'Praye'rs'. Though I have found 'Anathema's' and 'Hero's', the apostrophe hardly ever occurs in plurals: it is regular in possessive singulars, among which, however 'Churches' appears for 'Church's'. Hyphenation is not profuse; in particular, prefixes like 'out-', 'over-', 'un-', 'off-', and suffixes like '-men', '-boys', denoting classes of people, are not hyphenated. Oldham writes 'outgo', 'overlay', 'overan', 'offspring', 'unnumber'd', 'Statesmen', 'Linkboys'. Among his spellings, the most evidential are those from which he never varies, and those for which he has a very strong preference. These are listed in Table III, where I give (except for the hyphenations and apostrophe plurals) the number of instances observed. 37 Table III.

There are only seven instances of 'chuse' (6) or 'choose' (1); and against 'miter' (3), 'theater' (3), 'scepter' (1), 'meager' (1), the alternatives 'metre' (2), 'theatre' (1), do occur, and 'centre' (1) is to be noted. Even apart from the invariable 'loth'd', an inclination towards 'o' rather than 'oa' is reflected in 'yoke' (3), 'choke' (3), 'bode' (3), 'boding' (1) and 'doting' (2), but the minority, 'choak' (2), 'doating' (1), 'boad' (1) is not negligible. Out of some seventy words in 'or' or 'our', leaving aside the invariable 'honour' and its derivatives (Table III), 'our' predominates, but only in the proportion of four to three. Several are spelt both ways: 'emperour' (3 vs. 1.), 'favour'd', 'favourites' (3 vs. 3), 'conquerour' (1 vs. 2), 'assertours' (1 vs. 1), for example; others—'labour' (6), 'terrour' (4), 'valour' (2), but, contrariwise, 'horror' (4) —are spelt in one way only. Besides 'ey', 'ow', 'aw' (Table IV), 'som', 'becom', 'welcom', 'troublesom', 'palat', 'doctrin', 'achiev' and the like show Oldham's fondness for spelling without final e mute; but he also writes 'some', 'become', 'doctrine', 'atchieve', and indeed on occasion, 'Jesuite', 'toile', 'girle', 'undoe', 'assassine' and so forth. The pattern of his double or single consonants, medial and final, is even more complex, and it is probably as well that they are not indispensable evidence. Examples out of many words spelt either way are 'wickedness' (16), 'wickednes' (6), 'Address' (2), 'addressing' (3), 'adress' (1), 'adressing' (1). Such forms as 'marr', 'interr', 'shamm', like 'thorowout' and 'throwout', are striking when reproduced by a compositor. The spelling of one word is exceptionally various: 'forein' (2), 'forrein' (2), 'forreign' (3), and 'foreign'. Finally, although 'e'er' is conspicuous by its absence, 'ne'er' (18) balances 'ne're' (13) and 'nere' (5); six of the eighteen instances, however, are in the fair copy of a single poem. 39 Passing from the autographs to the editions, it will be best to begin with Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, where the data for the compositor's practices are virtually complete. I shall call him SJ82. Setting as he is from the first edition, 1681, on the whole he follows copy closely, so that he does little to obscure the contrast between the sections of text there set by L and M; indeed, many of the author's spellings still come through. 40 In both sections, he inserts new hyphens. Though he retains 'Statesmen', 'Henchboys', his inclination is to change 'outdo' and its fellows to 'out-do', 'out-face', 'o're-ran', 're-spread', 'non-sence'; he also, less strikingly, hyphenates pairs of words unhyphenated in his copy: 'Priest-guelder', 'Chimny-Tales', 'all-pow'rful', 'Hot-House', 'Passion-Nails', ' Powder-Plot ', 'Saddle-Pomel', 'Wiping-Paper', 'Church-Dispensatories', 'Country-Saints'. Apostrophes, too, are inserted: for metrical elision, and sometimes to mark possessive singulars; but no new ones for plurals, though 'Anathema's', ' Molucco's ', 'Grotto's', 'Chimaera's', 'Limbo's' are retained. The elisions (and the possessive 'Church's' for 'Churches') often required the dropping of 'e' when the apostrophe was introduced, and the resulting habit produces a number of abnormal spellings: 'Fraterniti's', 'Mari's', 'Agu's', 'Candl's'. 'Vertu's' (p. 130), however, may be an expedient to save space in a full line. So strong are the habits of marking possessives, and elisions before 'd' in past participles, that the compositor intrudes an apostrophe once in 'her's' and once in 'baw'd'. On fifty-four of the occasions when the verseline is too long to print undivided, he departs from the methods of division there used by L and M. On six he uses a turn-over opposite the space between the lines instead of opposite the preceding or succeeding line of print; on forty-eight, a form of overflow thus exemplified on p. 67 (F 2 r ): Chuse first some dextrous Rogue, well-tri'd, and known (Such by Confession your Familiars grown) —a form in which he also follows M a hundred and twenty-seven times in sheets H to L. Above all he peppers the text with additional commas, including (out of a total of almost three hundred) two hundred before 'and', 'or', and the like. His substitutions of his own spellings for those of his copy are listed in Table IV. I give the spellings, by L and M, from which the alterations were made. Cross-reference to Table III will supply comparison with Oldham's usage: if it is not recorded there, I indicate relevant forms from his MS, (designated R). TABLE IV.

Some check is provided, however, by the work of L, who is certainly not SJ82. Where their practices differ, a common house-style was evidently not in force. L's work does show some of the same features as SJ82's. He has 'sense', 'forein', 'eyes' (p. 29, beside 'Eys', p. 60); the 'e' mute in 'haste', 'waste', and similarly in 'else'; some mistaken elisions of 'e' with the apostrophe: 'who're' (for 'whoe're'), 'plac't', 'mak't; and two or three apostrophes in plurals: 'Anathema's', ' Molucco 's' and 'Prayer's'—which last, however, is probably the misintepretation of an autograph 'Praye'rs'. Clearly one cannot rely on these forms in the attempt to distinguish among and identify Mary Clark's compositors, though in the full picture of a compositor's practice they have their place. Fortunately, L's is far from suggesting that all SJ82's departures from copy should be referred to house-style or general usage. L's hyphenations are not much more frequent than they are likely to have been in his copy: some of those which link pairs of words may be his own, but he seldom divides words, and almost never hyphenates prefix or suffix in the manner of SJ82. The exceptions are 'Play-house', 'Fly-flap', 'Church-yards', and one suffix, 'Fisher-men'. Faced with verse-lines too long for his measure, his methods of division agree only three times with SJ82's. On p. 33 he uses the same type of overflow, and twice on p. 54 the same type of turn-over. His commonest method (seventeen instances) is a turn-over tucked in at the end of the previous or the next line of print. On the remaining nine occasions he has a line of leading before as well as after the overflow; on at least three this is in order to lose space. Though he has 'Judgments', he never uses the '-dg' ending, but always spells 'badge' (3), 'Bridge', 'Knowledge', 'edge', 'Priviledge'. Nor does he divagate from Oldham's practice in 'loth'd', 'yoke', 'spite', 'spiteful', 'easy', 'tho'' or 'tho', all of which occur once each: 'loath'd', 'yoak', 'spight', 'spightfull', 'easie' and 'though' do not appear. Finally, there is no sign of a mania for commas before 'and'; Oldham's paired words are left without them. We can now marshal the evidence which favours the hypothesis of Some New Pieces , 1681, Poems , And Translations , 1683, and Remains , 1684, having been set by Compositor SJ82. Whoever set them, one man or several, certainly shared many of the characteristics displayed in the 1682 volume. The evidence pointing to SJ82 consists in the first place of features common to all four texts, with secondary support from features common to two or three. In Some New Pieces and Poems, And Translations , we can test compositorial preferences more closely, by collating the printed text of five poems with the autograph fair copies in the Rawlinson MS. The autographs actually printed from are unlikely to have differed much in their accidentals from these, which are therefore fairly good guides to the compositor's probable departures from copy in the poems concerned: 'Upon A Printer' and the paraphrases on Psalm 137 and the Hymn of S. Ambrose in Some New Pieces ; the ode on Jonson and the 'Dithyrambique' in Poems, And Translations . 44 As regards divergent spellings of significant words, Table V records the results of this collation.

Oldham's spellings are 'feud', and regularly time after time, 'Quire'. Oldham does have 'forein'; the point here is that, except for 'foreigners' once in Poems, And Translations , the prints never reproduce any of Oldham's other three spellings, 'foreign', 'forreign', and 'forrein'. Since, however, L too has 'forein', this may be house-style. The hyphenated prefixes and suffixes given in Table VI represent only a fraction of the compositorial hyphenations in compound words which I have noted in Some New Pieces (16), Poems, And Translations (43), and Remains (29). The spellings 'sovereign' and 'easie' are invariable throughout the four volumes; 'ie' spellings moreover, are in a big majority in Some New Pieces and Poems, And Translations . Numerous 'yd' endings show Remains keeping closer to copy, as it does also with 'Judge' (2), 'knowledge' (4), 'Badge', Priviledge', 'Sacriledge', and 'Colledge', even while compositorial habit breaks through in 'Judg' (1) and 'knowledg' (1). Copy again is reflected in 'brest' (2), contrasting with the compositorial 'breast' (9). The comparisons concerning 'Honor' and other '-or' spellings require special comment. Compositor SJ82 usually retains 'Honour' from his copy, Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, but on one occasion alters it to 'Honor'. Some New Pieces , besides 'Honor' nine times, has 'Honour' six, and 'Dishonour' once, no doubt from copy. 'Honor' in Poems, And Translations occurs once, where the corresponding autograph fair copy has 'Honour'. In both these volumes, and in Remains also, many further '-or' spellings must be compositorial, even though the complexity of Oldham's practice forbids comparisons of particular words. What is evident, however, is that from being a minority, as three is to four, in the whole body of Oldham's autographs, the 'or' spellings have become a majority in these printed texts, though the majority varies: twenty against six in Remains ; as low as twenty-six against twenty-two in Poems, And Translations . With 'ne'er' and 'ne're', Oldham's usage, if we count 'ne're' and 'nere' together, is evenly balanced. Compositor SJ82 shows a large majority for 'ne're' and so does Some New Pieces . Yet the real compositorial preference may be for 'ne'er'; SJ82 in one place alters the copy-spelling 'ne're' to 'ne'er'; and similarly a 'ne'er' in Some New Pieces corresponds to a 'ne're' in the autograph. When we come to Poems, And Translations, 'ne'er' preponderates very decidedly; and in the proportion of ten to one in Remains . Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. In 'Choire', 'fewd', and 'fewel', we have already had example of the resemblances in accidentals which, without running through all four of the texts we are considering, form cross-links between them. One of the most salient is the intruded apostrophe in 'do'st', connecting Poems, And Translations with Some New Pieces , where in the 'Hymn of St Ambrose' it recurs five times (the autograph fair copy reading 'dost'). This abnormal spelling is found twice more in Some New Pieces , and four times in Poems, And Translations (once contrary to the fair copy). Another abnormal form, 'ne'r', probably resulting from mistaken omission of the 'e' when inserting the apostrophe, occurs three times in Some New Pieces and twice in Poems, and Translations (though once in a full line). Recollecting that 'spite', with one exception, is Oldham's form, and that SJ82 changes it three times out of four, the seven instances of 'spight' in Some New Pieces , with the three of 'spight' and one of 'spightful' in Poems, And Translations , constitute an important link, all the more as two of these readings, one in each volume, can be contrasted with their counterparts in the autograph fair copies. The apostrophe plural is very rare with Oldham: and so the number found in Remains and in Poems, And Translations , six in each, connects them strongly. Like SJ82, the compositor of Remains can wrongly drop an 'e' at the adding of an apostrophe ('wer't', 'plac't'); but this happens also with L, and at least once with Oldham himself, who writes 'los't' for 'lose't'. To conclude this examination of continuity in the workmanship between Compositor SJ82 and Some New Pieces , 1681, Poems And Translations , 1683, and Remains , 1684, one orthographical and one specifically bibliographical feature should be considered. Matching the spate of commas added by SJ82, the printed texts of the Jonson ode and the 'Dithrambique' in Poems, And Translations , compared with the autographs, have a hundred fresh commas before 'and'. For the three poems in Some New Pieces where the like comparison can be made, the figure is forty-seven, still a very high one. For Remains , we have only Oldham's general habit to go on. Despite the closer following of copy, some twenty of the commas before 'and', occurring in such doublets as 'Cells, and Grotto's', are almost certainly the compositor's; and there are about fifty more that I should hesitate to ascribe to the author. In all three volumes (except for sheets B and C of Remains ), when a verse-line is too long to print undivided, the solution overwhelmingly preferred is an overflow of the type unleaded above and leaded below. This is the type adopted by SJ82 forty-eight times out of the fifty-four when he departs from copy, and one hundred and twenty-eight out of the one hundred and forty-three when he follows it. Poems, And Translations has no turn-overs at all, and one double-leaded overflow against two hundred and twenty-five of the usual type. Some New Pieces has seventy-four of these, two of them in pages where a turnover, tucked in at the end of a line of print, is also employed: four turnovers of this kind, all but one quite early in the compositor's work, are his only deviations from his regular method. In Remains , outside sheets B and C (the first to be set), only two of the fifty long lines are differently dealt with. Even in the exceptional sheets there are eleven of the customary overflows. That makes fifty-nine in the whole volume, against twenty-four of the turn-overs peculiar to it. For these many similarities in the setting-up of text in the four volumes, the simplest explanation would be that Compositor SJ82 set them all. If this is too much to believe, then (it must be supposed) they were set by two or more workmen of remarkably similar habits, with little if anything to differentiate them. The question now arises whether Compositor M presents a different picture: whether he is Compositor SJ82, or at least one of the same hypothetical pair or group; or else, like L, someone quite distinct. The best evidence of his practice is his version of 'A Satyr Against Vertue', where his copy-text, the 1679 edition, is available. Further, in 'Upon a Woman', the forms in front of him can be inferred, with probability, from the autograph fair copy; and in some passages of the 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' they can be inferred, with somewhat less assurance, from the corresponding passages of the autograph drafts. Like SJ82, M was on the whole remarkably faithful to the accidentals of printed copy. In three hundred and seventy lines he departs only in seventy details from the 1679 Satyr Against Vertue . Table VII indicates his significant changes of spelling compared with that edition, with the fair copy of 'Upon A Woman', and with parallel drafts for 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits'.

The most characteristic of the hyphenations, as with SJ82, concern prefixes and suffixes 'over-', 'out-', (2), '-men' (2). The additions of mute 'e'; the 'ie' or 'oi' for 'y' or 'oy', (though cp., once each, 'lyes' for 'Lies' and 'Apology' for 'Apologie'); the 'or' for 'our' (though once, 'favourites' for 'Favorites'); 45 the 'dg', especially in 'judg', for 'dge' (though the reverse change in 'alledge', 'Sacriledge' has to be noted); 'Ne'er' for 'Ne're'; the single for double consonants; the unabbreviated 'through';—these changes all have their parallels in those made by Compositor SJ82. One can extend the scrutiny of M's performances to that part of it where comparison with Oldham's autographs becomes general instead of particular: a comparison with his prevailing usage. Table VIII assembles spellings in which M departs from it; though where (as with 'our' and 'or', and with double or single consonants) there is a strong minority form besides the prevailing one, we have to remember that the copy may have had the minority-form, and M may simply have reproduced it. He does reproduce many authorial spellings, contrary to some in Table VIII.

His 'died', meaning 'dyed', and especially 'plaid' for 'play'd', are striking examples of the addiction to 'i' forms; 'Jointers' may be contrasted with 'joynt', an Oldham spelling; 'easie' compares with 'easie' and 'easy' in the autographs. 'Sovereign', not exemplified in Table VII, affords a new parallel with SJ82, who in resetting from L once substitutes that spelling for 'soveraign'. M has 'Soveraign' on p. 41, 'Sovereign' on p. 83, the second no doubt his alteration, for the autographs have 'Soveraign' in four places and 'soverain' in two, but never 'Sovereign'. To support M's two solitary instances of 'judg' and 'judgment' where they are contrary to copy, his 'strangly', meaning 'strangely', exemplifies the dropping of 'e' after 'g', so conspicuous in the 'dg' endings everywhere found in the printed texts we are examining. Oldham's strong preference for 'brest' (16) over 'breast' (4) is reversed by M (4 against 8); SJ82 has 'brest' only twice (retained from copy) and 'breast' twelve times, including three alterations from copy. In Some New Pieces and Poems, And Translations , 'breast' is invariable; in Remains 'brest' occurs on two occasions, but 'breast' on nine. M has 'lest', Oldham's form, besides 'least', which is that of SJ82 (2, once against copy), Some New Pieces (2), Poems, And Translations (8), and Remains (4). With twelve instances of 'spite', Oldham's almost invariable spelling, M seems always to follow copy in that word, but at least does not reject the two occurrences of 'spight' in the 1679 Satyr Against Vertue . His tolerance of 'spight', and SJ82's preference for it, are paralleled in Some New Pieces and Poems, And Translations (see Table VI). Remains , where the word appears twice, each time (no doubt from copy) has Oldham's spelling, 'spite'. As regards turn-overs and overflows, except in his share of 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', where the thirty-eight double-leaded overflows are a means adopted to lose space, M invariably employs for his overflows the style so general with SJ82 and in the other three volumes, with leading below and not above. In A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679, the verse of each stanza is set solid and without overflows, so that the twelve turn-overs required for lines which even the quarto page will not take undivided are of the kind tucked-in at the end of the next or the previous line of print. M changes all these to overflows unleaded above and leaded below, and (his page being octavo) introduces sixty-five new overflows of the same pattern. With fifty more in 'The Passion of Byblis' and 'Upon A Woman', his total reaches a hundred and twenty-seven. It may be significant that when in M's assignment or in the three subsequent first editions there are exceptions to the usual practice, these exceptions come, for the most part, early in the compositor's work. M's seven turn-overs are in the first six pages he set. Three of the four in Some New Pieces (the same kind as M's) are in the first sheet and the first page of the second; the sole double-leaded overflow in Poems, And Translations is on B4 v , where A was evidently reserved for the preliminaries. Similarly, all but two of the twenty-four turn-overs peculiar to the Remains are in B and C, the earliest sheets. Compositor SJ82, setting-up a second edition from a copy of the first, is in a different situation; and yet he too is perhaps less decided at the beginning than later on. After 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' he has, in any event, no problems: there, M consistently uses the normal overflows, unleaded above and leaded below, and with equal consistency SJ82 follows him. This is the form of division most congenial to SJ82 as well as M, for in 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' he substitutes it, on forty-two occasions, for other forms in his copy, including all the double-leaded overflows M adopted to lose space. At the beginning of his work, however, he was faced with L's tucked-in turn-overs. He follows the first one, changes the next five to his accustomed overflows, then follows eleven of L's next thirteen, changing only two to the overflow. But now, on pp. 33-35, he has four of the overflows, and another on p. 56. On p. 54 he has followed L again, when for the only time L puts the turn-overs not at the end of a line of type, but at the end of the space between the lines. Having adopted this form from L, he employs it also when he meets the first of M's seven exceptional tucked-in turn-overs. He repeats it with the next five of these, but keeps as it stands, perhaps inadvertently, the seventh and last. His treatment of turn-overs, changing only twelve of them to the normal overflows, may be influenced by the fact that he is setting page for page with his copy-text: the overflows take up more room. So far, investigation has yielded little or nothing that militates against Compositor SJ82 being M himself. Indeed it supports the hypothesis that the whole run of texts, from M's share of Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, to Remains , 1684, are the work of a single compositor, or else of a pair or group with habits so much in common that it is impossible to distinguish one man from another. There are, however, a few features in one or other of the texts which may give us pause. Against the identification of Compositor SJ82 with M, four objections might be brought. First, if he is M, why is he much more lavish with commas, especially before 'and', introducing many even when setting from M's work itself? An answer is not hard to find. The difference is not flat contrast, but a progression. For M shows the same inclination though in a much less extreme degree. Comparing his print of 'A Satyr Upon A Woman' with the autograph fair copy, we find twelve additional commas before 'and', and twenty-three in all. As we have noted, Oldham rarely has a comma before the 'and' in a doublet, such as 'Life &amp; name' (though there are three instances in the fair copy of 'Upon A Woman'). Probably most of the commas in such doublets set by M are the compositor's additions. I have counted forty-eight. As with commas, so to a lesser extent with apostrophes. M does not make a point of inserting them for elisions and possessive singulars, but his 'Church's' for 'Churches' probably, and his 'watch'd' for 'watcht' certainly, represent divergences from copy. The five apostrophe plurals set by SJ82 (all following copy) are matched by M's 'Grotto's,' ' Chimaera 's,' and ' Limbo 's'. In 1681 M had no doubt to work under pressure. Otherwise, why was the work divided, and why was a first issue hastened out, lacking a poem of which the title-page implied the presence? In 1682, the compositor is at his ease, setting line-by-line from a text recently produced in his own printing-house, and supposing he is M, the greater part of it by himself. Small wonder if he has leisure to indulge his penchant for inserting commas, especially before 'and'. Thus in the different circumstances of composition, even the large increase in this practice does not constrain us to postulate a new compositor in 1682. A like explanation is available for the second difference in compositorial procedure, though this difference is a plain contrast: it, too, may exhibit the same man composing under different conditions. Whatever the explanation, SJ82 capitalises more freely than his copy, whereas M, when checked against his copy in A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679, and against the autograph of 'Upon a Woman', is found to do the opposite. On this point, Some New Pieces , 1681, and Poems, And Translations , 1683, yield evidence against referring the two practices to two compositors. In Poems, And Translations , if we collate 'A Dithyrambique' with the autograph it appears that in every stanza but one, the compositor, like M, must have considerably reduced the capitalisation of his copy. Yet in stanza II, and (as a corresponding collation indicates) in the Jonson ode, he seems to have increased it exactly as it is increased by SJ82. Both phenomena are revealed also in Some New Pieces by a collation of the three poems for which we possess autograph fair copies. 'The Hymn of S. Ambrose' shows a marked increase of capitals, along with a sizeable minority of alterations in the reverse direction. The paraphrase on Psalm 137, on the other hand, has a very few capitals not in the autograph, and a large number of changes to lower-case initial letters. These are also the majority, but by a fairly narrow margin over the new capitals, in 'Upon a Printer'. I can see no reason to believe that these three poems in Some New Pieces , or the two in Poems, And Translations , belonged to stints of different compositors. So I conclude that the same man could treat capitals now like M and now like SJ82, who therefore, despite the contrast in capitalisation, need not be two distinct people. I come now to the third and fourth objections. The liking for 'dg' endings, so prominent with SJ82, and in Some New Pieces and Poems, And Translations , is seen, if M does share it, only twice in his work; and one of these occurrences is hardly evidential: his 'judg' in 'A Satyr Against Vertue' follows copy, and moreover he may have retained it only because the line was full. Further, in two successive lines where A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679, has the '-dg', M departs from it, with 'alledge' and 'Sacriledge'. As to this, it may be answered, somewhat lamely, that to add final 'e' mutes is a habit with both M and SJ82. There can be no doubt that M's copy for 'Upon a Woman' read 'judge', Oldham's only form; and that there M did substitute 'judg'. The absence of 'dg' endings elsewhere is not a serious difficulty: we need only presume that in three places, with 'Judge', 'judge', and 'grudge', he followed copy. Finally, there are the spellings 'human', 'humane.' Here SJ82 is the odd man out, while Some New Pieces and Remains are linked with M. Oldham always writes 'human'. Re-setting 'A Satyr Against Vertue', M once retains 'Human' and once alters it to 'humane'. In 'Upon a Woman', contrary to the autograph, he has 'humane', and 'humane' too, the only other time the word recurs. Some New Pieces never spells otherwise than 'humane' (6), 'inhumane' (3); Remains has 'humane' four times, against 'human' once. Poems, And Translations , on the other hand, with 'human' (9) and 'inhuman' (2) never diverges from Oldham's spelling, which of course must have stood in its copy. SJ82, re-setting from L's work, keeps 'inhuman'; and from M's, the one instance of 'human'. That need occasion even less surprise than the absence, in Poems, And Translations , of even one alteration out of eleven possible opportunities. What is remarkable is that SJ82 changes M's three instances of 'humane' into 'human', the opposite change to M's. However, if this contrast is taken as decisive against identifying him with M, it must decisively separate him from Some New Pieces also: such a verdict has to contend with the similarities of workmanship not only between him and M, but likewise between him and Some New Pieces . The contrast between Poems, And Translations , 1683, and Some New Pieces , 1681, in their treatment of Oldham's 'human' is one of a very few facts which, taken by themselves, would suggest the participation, in these two volumes and the Remains , of distinct compositors. Some New Pieces differs again from Poems, And Translations and also from Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, in having 'Rhyme' (3), 'Rhymers' (1), alongside 'Rhime' (3) and 'rhiming' (1), which represent Oldham's form. (The words do not occur in Remains 1684). Remains alone exhibits an obvious preference for 'e'er' (13), which Oldham never uses, against 'e're' (2). A latent preference for it is, however, perhaps indicated by single instances in Some New Pieces (p. 132), contrary to the autograph fair copy, and in Poems, And Translations (p. 194). As for 'ne'er', where the copy was autograph, any given occurrence may simply follow the author's spelling, since he has 'ne'er' and 'ne're' (or 'nere') in something like equal numbers. But the overwhelming majority for 'ne'er' in Remains (10 vs. 1) and Poems, And Translations (16 vs. 4) is unlikely to reflect copy throughout. Compositor SJ82, setting from print, reproduces the copy-spelling 'ne're' eighteen times, but once (p. 8) significantly changes it to 'ne'er'. M has no 'ne'er'; out of his ten instances of 'ne're', five follow printed copy, one agrees with the spelling in a draft, for two there is no MS. version extant. If on these last two occasions, or any of the other three where he was setting from MS., M did alter 'ne'er' to 'ne're', he might have been seeking consistency. Postulating a compositor with this desire, combined with the strong inclination (as shown by SJ82) to follow copy, and a personal preference for 'e'er' and 'ne'er' which eventually gained the upper hand, one could attribute to him all the observed procedures. That would include those of Poems, And Translations , where the standard forms are 'ne're' (10 vs. 1), as in the earlier volumes, and 'e'er' (13 vs. 2), as in Remains . Here, if one is maintaining the theory of a single compositor (except L) for all the texts, one can suggest that he has at length begun to follow his own preference for 'e'er', and has done his best to do so consistently, while between the no doubt varying 'ne're' and 'ne'er' of his copy, he also attempts a consistent practice, in line with what he had done before, though in Remains he will change it in accordance with the preference he had for the most part suppressed, and will achieve consistency between 'ne'er' and 'e'er'. The treatment of Oldham's compounds 'whoe're', 'whate're', 'wheresoe'r' and the like, on the whole helps to support the idea that we are watching the same workman throughout. Until the Remains , these are regularly spelt with 'e're'; but, more important, they are nearly always divided. We have 'what e're' by M (5, one from printed copy), by SJ82 (5, all from M), and in Some New Pieces (4); 'where e're' in Some New Pieces (1) and Poems, And Translations (1); 'when e're' in Some New Pieces (1); 'How e're' by M (1, from printed copy) and SJ82 (1, from M); 'whom e're' by M (1) and SJ82 (1, from M). The exceptions are 'whoe're' once (but in a full line, to save space) by M and thence by SJ82, and 'whate're' twice by M, twice thence by SJ82, and twice in Poems, and Translations . In Remains , which has 'whate'er' (1), 'Howe'er' (1), 'whatsoe'er' (3), the habit of dividing shows itself once, in 'whom soe're' (p. 66). Poems, And Translations , 1683, shows the largest number of exceptional forms. 'Vertue' is not found; and besides fourteen occurrences of 'Virtue', there are 'Mistrisses' (3), 'ghest' (2), 'ghastly' (1) and 'ghastliest' (1). Were these spellings distributed in some pattern of bibliographical units, one would suspect the presence of a second compositor; if from these units the characteristics found elsewhere in the volume and the series were absent, one would be practically certain of it. When these tests are applied, the most that can be said is that eight of the unusual spellings come in L Outer and L Inner, three in B Outer, and three in K Inner. But the remaining eitht are scattered elsewhere; and in each of these formes the accustomed hyphens and commas before 'and' make their appearance. And the man who set 'virtue' in each is capable of setting not only 'non-sense' or 'down-right', but also 'Knowledg', on the same page. Moreover, the spelling 'virtue' is not wholly peculiar to Poems, And Translations : M has it (p. 84), where, as in Poems, And Translations , it is practically certain to be an alteration of the copy-spelling. 46 To sum up the discussion of the five texts, from M's part in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, to Remains , 1684, one can now attempt to sketch a profile that would delineate a single compositor responsible for them all, bearing in mind that if there was in fact more than one, the profile will be a composite, representative of a pair or group. Either way, it may be helpful at this point to bring together the characteristics of this figure. He is responsive to the accidentals of his copy, particularly when composing from print. He is lavish with commas, especially before 'and'. In italicisation he is moderate and logical; in capitalisation, somewhat inconsistent, now increasing and now diminishing it from similar copy. He has a strong preference for overflows rather than turn-overs, and normally sets them with leading below but not above, though of course he will double-lead them to lose space, or not lead them at all in a passage set solid. Nor does he eschew turn-overs altogether, but on occasion uses three different varieties: tucked-in before or after the neighboring line of print; placed at the end of the leading between the lines; or in the same position with a further line of leading below. He introduces hyphens, sometimes to join separate words but more often to divide compounds, and especially for prefixes and suffixes. Without a hyphen, he commonly divides Oldham's 'whoe're' and the like. From time to time he inserts an apostrophe before the plural 's'—but L does the same. In two of his most striking spelling preferences he is not invariably consistent; 'humane' and the 'dg' ending as in 'Judg'. In numerous instances he substitutes these for the spellings in his copy; but in one place he alters two 'dg's to 'dge's, and in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, thrice alters 'humane' to 'human'. Further preferences are for 'least', 'breast', 'sovereign', 'forein', 'spight', 'spightfull', 'sense' (shared with L), 47 'jealousie', and other 'ie' or 'i' spellings instead of 'y'; 'honor' and other 'or' endings, and 'through' without abbreviation. The preferences do not result in a majority for each of the favoured forms; they are discernible by contrast with the forms we can attribute to the copy. 'Ne'er', especially when it does predominate, must sometimes witness to a preference. Another, previously latent, seems to emerge in the 'e'er' of Remains , and even 'virtue' in Poems, And Translations may have the same explanation. 48 In 'do'st', undoubtedly, and also most likely in 'Choire', 'fewd', 'fewel', we have occasional spellings of our compositor's, or compositor-figure's. Whether it was he or Oldham who veered into 'Rhyme', 'rhymers', 'Ghest', 'ghastly', 'mistrisses', I am not able to give an opinion. The remaining text that concerns us, A Satyr Against Vertue , 1679, although pirated, certainly came from Mary Clark's printing-house. 49 I am inclined to think that it was set by M. The evidence, however, is not all one might wish for. Partly this is because A Satyr consists of only two sheets, quarto; and partly, again, because the copy will not have been in Oldham's autograph, so that we have no independent key to the probable forms of its accidentals. But in addition, doubt must arise when we cannot point to M's customary overflows, or to more than a few possible signs of his propensity to add commas. The stanzas are set solid, unlike most of the verse in the subsequent volumes. In Some New Pieces , however, 'Upon a Printer' is set in this way, and so are the memorial verses to Oldham in the Remains . In these places, overflows (unleaded) are employed; but in A Satyr Against Vertue turn-overs, tucked-in after the previous or the next line of print. M, it will be remembered, did begin with this last method in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681; and if he is indeed the compositor of Some New Pieces , used it four times there. 50 Of the commas in A Satyr Against Vertue , twenty-four are superfluous, if we judge by Oldham's carefully-punctuated fair copy; 51 but since the pirate's copy was a MS. in circulation, we cannot tell how many of these were compositorial and how many scribal in origin. M's spelling 'humane' does not occur; the word appears twice as 'Human'. Other spellings, however, do suggest M as the workman: 'alledg', 'Sacriledg', 'breast', 'Sovereign', 'spight' (2); 'easie', 'busie', 'Apologie', 'die', with support from 'dye', 'lye' (which M prefers to 'dy', 'ly'); 'Republick' and three other 'ick' endings; and perhaps 'virtue' beside 'vertue' (5) and 'vertuous'. 52 The error 'Stagarite' is one which M corrects in the next edition ( Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681): but if he is SJ82, he then re-introduces it, contrary to copy. The divisions of 'How ere', 'Who ere' (2), and particularly the hyphenations 'out-do', 'out-grown', 'O're-power'd', 'brain-sick', 'green-sickness' are characteristic of M's work. Our final task is to examine the self-evident or demonstrable errors of the compositors, both to discover any kinds to which they may show themselves prone, and to compare the incidence of error in the different volumes, or, for Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, in the bibliographically-distinct parts of the volume. Some variations in the incidence of error may tentatively be ascribed to differing conditions in which the work was done. On the incidence of error, I offer my findings with diffidence. The mistakes are often sparse for statistical treatment, while the suggested differences in the haste of composition are more hypothetical than I should like, and in part inferred from the very rates of error they are invoked to explain. At least, however, I was able to follow SJ82 as he set from print, L's or M's—and M's may well be his own former handiwork. Everywhere else, moreover, it was safe to assume that the compositors were setting from Oldham's autograph fair copy, the characteristics of which are known. In 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', neither compositor seems hurried until he reaches the sheets divided between them. Among the mistakes in L's 592 lines on sheets B and C, I classify only one as a 'literal' misprint; and in M's 481 on F and G, only one again. Here (excluding punctuation) L's errors almost treble M's: one in every forty-two lines against one in every hundred-and-twenty, approximately. But in sheets D and E, M's superiority drops sharply. As half-a-dozen 'literals' bear witness, M is hardest pressed in sheet D, where he has ten pages to L's six. In sheet E, with the allotment of pages reversed, L in turn has six 'literals' (in 202 lines), compared with two (in 109 lines) in sheet D. At his worst, in sheet E, L has one error to 13.5 lines; while M, at his in sheet D, has one in 15.3. Under less pressure, M, in sheet E, has no 'literals', and a total of three errors in 116 lines (one in 38.17). Comparably, L in sheet D has five, or one to 21.8—nearly double his rates in B and C. In the rest of the book M is on his own, setting 'A Satyr Against Vertue' from the pirated quarto, and 'Byblis' and 'Upon A Woman' from autograph; 'Upon a Woman' for the second issue. Only in this third poem, occupying the last five pages of the extended text, does his rate of error rise high: to an average of one in twenty lines. Here he may be hastening, to enable the new issue to be brought out quickly. If we take 'Byblis' with sheets F and G of 'Satyrs Upon the Jesuits', because together they constitute the sections he set, from autograph, without marks of haste, they yield one error to 92.3 lines. This is practically identical with his average, one to 92.75, in setting 'A Satyr Against Vertue' from print that was more likely than not his own work in the first place. The averages for Some New Pieces , and for Remains , are close to these. For Poems, And Translations , the figure is better, but not so much so as to be anomalous in the series. Taking all three together, the distribution whether of their errors in general, or of their 'literal' misprints in particular, does not seem to indicate special pressure at any point. Some New Pieces , with twenty-five errors in 2376 lines, averages one in 95: Remains , in verse, with sixteen in 1608, averages one in 100.5; and in prose, with six in 614, one in 102.3. Poems, And Translations has twenty-six in its 3807 lines, an average of one in 146.4. In Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1682, it will be remembered, the compositor introduced a host of new commas. We took this as meaning that he was composing at his ease; yet compared with what seems to be unhurried compositorial performance elsewhere in these Oldham editions, he is much less accurate than one might expect. The two phenomena are perhaps not irreconcilable. Without any sense of being hurried—so that he could indulge his passion for commas—he was no doubt working a good deal more rapidly from print than the rate at which the comparable texts, from MS., were set. His 'literals' are twenty-five in 2583 lines, and his errors average one for every 47. The suggested explanation gains some support from a drop both in 'literals' and in the ratio of error while he is setting 'A Satyr Against Vertue', where the exceptional number of changes to be made in order to rectify the bad 1681 text would no doubt slow him up, and induce more care. Here he has only four 'literals' in 374 lines, and an error ratio of one in 53.4, against 48.4 when re-setting M's pages (which may well have been his own), and 38.2 when re-setting L's. Throughout the five volumes, from Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, onward, all these errors, including L's, belong to the regular kinds one can expect of a compositor. Reverting to our profile of a single workman (for everything except L's stints), whether he corresponds to one, a pair, or several in actuality, we can proceed to classify his errors. The most numerous are his wrong letters (35) as in 'Ptophet', some of which may result from foul case. One may take his turned letters (2) with these. To omit single letters (19) is another of his besetting sins, and his omissions extend to single words (8). Only once does he intrude a word: 'the crafty' for 'crafty'. His corruptions often result from misreading MS. (16), or even print (2); or from the vulgarisations typical of copyists. The misreadings come chiefly from f/long s or y/th confusions, or from minims (particularly Oldham's r); and t and T also contribute. Thus we get 'Persecution', 'there', 'Natures', 'show'd', 'shove', ' Frier ', ' Todelet ', for 'Perfection', 'your', 'Natives', 'strow'd', 'strove', ' Fircu ', ' Jodelet '. Almost half the vulgarisations reduce a rarer grammatical form, usually the subjunctive, to a common one. Similarly, the unfamiliar ecclesiastical term 'Maniples' gives place to the less unfamiliar 'Manciples'; 'thoughts . . . well directed be' is re-set as 'thoughts . . . will directed be', obliterating the reference to 'direction of the intention'; ' St André ' becomes ' St Andrew ', and Guillim , Guilliam , though this last name was corrected in the course of printing. 53 A few deliberate emendations are also made, half-a-dozen of them wrong, as when 'a Tone' is miscorrected to 'at one' instead of 'attone'; and once the compositor appears to have misinterpreted what was no doubt an authentic revision in the autograph from which he was setting. 54 In five places his misjudgement of elisions injures the metre. Not unnaturally, proper names give him trouble: besides the four mentioned already, he disfigures at least seven others, though only by aberrant spellings. Two of the three words in which he transposes letters are Gordobuc (for Gorboduc ) and Baigno (for the somewhat exotic Bagnio ). Twice he inadvertently transposes words, and almost certainly on a third occasion also, where the change makes sense, and might conceivably be claimed as authorial revision. 55 The single haplography I have noticed is an obvious one; but his dittographies (5) range from the simple 'say say' to the corruption in So feeble are the struglings, and so weak In sleep we seem, and only sleep to make: . . . where 'sleep' has evidently been repeated instead of 'seem', and we should read: In sleep we seem, and only seem to make. 56 He is apt, we remember, to extrude 'e' when he inserts an apostrophe, as in 'don't' for 'done't'. His taste for hyphens produces the absurd 'How-goodly', and one really bad reading: 'taught her Cradle -like the Pulpit to reclaim' instead of 'taught her Cradle , like the Pulpit , to reclaim.' 57 He does not escape the commonplace confusion of singulars and plurals (12), nor the substitution of one minor word for another (11). Add a sprinkling of ordinary oversights: a failure to italicise, or to indent; to supply a quotation-mark, or a triplet-bracket; with half-a-dozen mis-spacings and as many misplaced apostrophes—and his tally of error is not far from complete. He shares with L a propensity to mispunctuate, especially by introducing premature full-stops, which no appeal to rhetorical principles of punctuation will justify. Once each, he and L add an unwanted 's' to the possessive of a classical name: ' Vitellius 's', 'Daphnis' s'. In L's assignment, so brief by comparison, one does not expect to find the whole varied assortment of errors seen in the rest of the compositorial work. All the same, the virtual absence of wrong letters, and of vulgarisation, are more likely to be characteristic of L than accidental. Since his rate of error is nevertheless higher than M's, and much higher when both are at their best, one's impression (fanciful, it may be) is of a less experienced but more cautious workman, with a clean case. He sometimes intrudes letters (as in 'poision', or, with transposition, 'preseverse' for 'persevere'), a fault, except for one or two additions of final 's', not found outside his stints. Like M, he misreads Oldham's 'T', with 'little' for 'Title', and 'Call' for 'tale' (the second mistake corrected during the printing). 58 In Mac-quire (2) he misreads Oldham's 'g' (attested by an autograph draft), as 'q'. 59 For the rest, his chief errors parallel some of those we have seen recurring throughout: omission of 'e' on inserting apostrophes; confusion between singulars and plurals, and between different parts of the verb; transposed letters, and once an omitted word. It would not be right to claim the foregoing bibliographical essay as a complete analysis. Nevertheless, it does go beyond a brief list of test words and their spellings, and has had the benefit of some kinds of evidence not always available: re-settings from known copy, and above all a sure knowledge of the author's orthography, established from extensive autograph MS., and not, as so often, dependent upon inference from the printed texts. With these advantages, it is perhaps disappointing that in the later volumes a fully confident identification of one or more compositors has not resulted. Such an identification was possible for Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, and there enables an editor to proceed in the certainty that the differences in orthography within the book do not indicate any change in the character of the copy. He can, indeed, strip from the text the peculiar italicisation introduced by Compositor L, which contrasts so oddly with Compositor M's, and violently distorts the author's practice, seen in the autograph fair copies of other poems. For he knows that that italicisation has no origin beyond the habit of the compositor. What, however, does the editor stand to gain from the analysis of Oldham's four subsequent volumes? Negatively, his gains are important. He is no longer in the dark, ignorant of how the copy was treated in the printing-house. It is unlikely that bibliographical evidence, of a kind that should govern editorial policy on the text or on units of text, is still lurking undiscovered. There are no bibliographical contrasts such as would suggest copy of more than one sort; in particular nothing to suggest that the posthumous Remains , 1684, was printed from a transcript and not from autograph. Autograph copy is, in any case, overwhelmingly probable for all the authorised first editions, but we can add that the bibliographical evidence favours it. Another positive outcome is the help given the editor when he faces the infrequent textual cruces. His judgments must have regard to the habits of the compositor or compositors; and since these, apart from some minor and ascertained variation, are remarkably constant from M's workmanship in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, to that of the Remains , 1684, it is all the easier to take account of them. Further, should he support a decision or conjecture about a crux by a parallel from elsewhere in these texts, he can be confident that the parallel is drawn if not from the work of the same compositor, at least from that of a man very similar in his habits. Workmen otherwise very similar might differ in fidelity to copy, as indeed might the same man at different times. But except in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, we have found no wide fluctuations in the rates of manifest error. Such fluctuation, so far as it can serve as an index of latent errors, would logically have encouraged freer emendation of suspicious readings in some places than in others. In Oldham, however, the issue hardly arises. For suspicious readings are few; editorial changes are for the most part either unnecessary, or obviously requisite, or rest upon actual evidence. In examining the books concerned, and interpreting the features they present, I have lacked the extensive experience of comparable volumes which a specialist in bibliography could bring to bear. I hope, however, that my article may make some contribution to bibliographical studies, especially if it leads to further investigation of the material on which it is based. Two lines of enquiry might start from our familiarity with Oldham's actual spellings and the like. I have noted but not explored their survival, in part, after two settings of type. The rate of their disappearance with each reprint would be worth investigating, and coupled with it the progressive obliteration of the differences between what were originally Compositor L's and Compositor M's stints in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits . Again, in studying the autographs and the editions, I was visited by the doubt whether, if I had had only the editions and had had to deduce Oldham's orthography from them, I should not have arrived at conclusions contrary at times to the facts of the autographs. Where Oldham uses two spellings without a strong preference for either, should I have been safe from attributing one to him and one to the compositor? And should I not have assigned to him the spellings 'fewel', 'fewd', and 'Choire', quite exceptional in the editions? To frame hypotheses from the editions alone, and then to compare them with the facts of the autographs, might be a good control-experiment for attempts to identify authorial spellings when there is only the evidence of print to go on, and might suggest some caveats. A question raised by the divergences of compositorial practice we have observed in certain places, combined with its close similarity, otherwise, throughout the editions, is how far consistency is to be expected of one and the same workman, and how far inconsistencies are to be accepted before we postulate a different one. Meanwhile, students of bibliography will, I hope, find some things in the article to reinforce their own researches. I have in mind the observation of compositors under varying conditions, of pressure or absence of pressure, of setting from MS., or from print, or when many corrections have to be made in reprinting. Then there is the endeavour to apply evidence from shortage of W's, from anomalous headlines, and from overflows and turn-overs. The responsibility of a compositor for the exceptional italics in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, may make a point outside some first-class bibliographers' experience: for a distinguished specialist, while not doubting the fact, has told me his surprise that the contrasting italicisation does not signify difference in the copy.</field>

Some of the copies listed in Wing as first editions are actually of this reprint. 7 It was not uncommon for a book published near the end of one year to bear the date of the next. 8 It is a pleasure to thank those who have facilitated this task: the Committee of the Central Research Fund, University of London; the staffs of the Bodleian and of the British Museum, Cambridge University, and Birkbeck College Libraries; and for access to their copies either in person or by microfilm, the Libraries of Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Guildhall, London; the Huntington Library; the New-berry Library, Chicago; and the Libraries of Yale University and of the University of Texas at Austin. The copy in the W. A. Clark Memorial Library, Los Angeles, is too tightly bound for microfilm; my friend Professor Earl Miner kindly inspected it on my behalf. In the later stages of my investigation I have had welcome help from Mr. Brian Jenkins and Dr. Laurel Brake, successively Research Assistants in the English Department at Birkbeck. Dr. Brake was also of great help in examining a large number of publications printed by Mary Clark. 9 MS. Rawlinson Poet 123, pp. 61-64b; Some New Pieces , 1681, pp. 131-134. I shall refer to the MS. (Oldham, Bibliography , I.1) as MS.R. 10 In Poems, and Translations , 1683, I5 was cancelled in order to reduce to two lines what was evidently a four-line allusion to Hindmarsh. See Oldham, Bibliography , p. 23. 11 And on which see D. M. Vieth, Attribution in Restoration Poetry (1963), ch. 3. 12 Ll. 7, 39, 113, 128, 137, 201, 251, 254, 260, 276 of the 'Satyr,' and l. 72 of the 'Apology'. I give the line-numbers of the poems for reference to my forthcoming edition. 13 MS.A is No. I.11 in Oldham, Bibliography : 'A Satyr Against Vertue' is on ff. 116 v -112 r (MS. inverted). For MS.m (I.16 in the Bibliography ), see H. M. Margoliouth (ed.), The Poems &amp; Letters Of Andrew Marvell , I, 318. 14 MS.A, copied apparently before the 'Apology' was appended to the 'Satyr', and (apart from the autograph) the only text I know which identifies the spokesman as a 'Court Hector' (vz. Rochester), does not have the readings of the Errata (which agree with the autograph) for p. 104, l. 6; p. 112, ll. 5 and 8; and p. 113, l. 2 (ll. 113, 248, 251, 260 of the 'Satyr'). MS.m diverges from the Errata (and autograph) at ll. 7, 39, 44, 64, 113, 238, 248, 251, 276, 281 of the 'Satyr' and l. 72 of the 'Apology' (cp. errata for p. 97, l. 7; p. 99, l. 14; p. 100, l. 2; p. 101, l. 7; p. 104, l. 6; p. 111, l. 9; p. 112, ll. 5 and 8; p. 113, l. 17; p. 114, l. 5; and p. 119, l. 1). 15 The fourth, for p. 118, l. 17 ('Apology,' l. 70) corrects 'it' to 'them': the autograph has 'em'. 16 An attempt in the 1670's to naturalise 'tuant' from French soon withered. All but one of the OED's examples belong to 1672-3. Oldham used the word in writings of 1676, 1681, and 1682. 17 Satyr III, ll. 201, 207, 213. 18 Prologue , l. 28. 19 Satyr II, ll. 20, 119. 20 Satyr II, l. 235. 21 When ll. 16 and 199, omitted in 1679 and 1681, but already in the autograph, are restored to 'A Satyr Against Vertue', Oldham is correcting; when 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits', II. 257, is changed from And scatter wide destruction all around to And spread avoidless ruine all around he is removing a tautology, and revising the phrase away from its source in Otway. 22 E4 v (p. 56); Satyr III, ll. 349-52. 23 Heavy italicisation, more or less of this kind, is not peculiar to one compositor. Even in volumes from Mary Clark's shop, the workman is sometimes merely reproducing the italicisation, hardly if at all distinguishable from L's, of an earlier edition set up elsewhere, cp. Henry Dodwell, Two Letters of Advice , second edition, 1680, printed 'by M. C. for Benjamin Tooke', with the first edition, Dublin, 1672, printed by Tooke for Joseph Wilde; and The Poems of Horace , ed. Alexander Brome, third edition, 1680, printed for Henry Brome by M. C., with the first edition, 1666, printed for him by E. Cotes. Compared with L in Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , however, Cote's compositor does seem more consistently predictable in his choice of words for italicisation. 24 Pp. 51, 78, 81; Satyr III, l. 253; Satyr IV, ll. 24, 79. 25 Pp. 63, 52, 53; Satyr III, ll. 493, 272, 289. There are thirty-nine italicised words on p. 54; thirty-one on p. 55. 26 They are on F1 v , F2 v , F3 r , F3 v . Evidently he began at the beginning of the first whole sheet allotted to him, and set seriatim. 27 Because he was completing the page for L, whose stint the copy (for this last page of 'Satyrs Upon The Jesuits' to be set) filled without trouble. 28 On p. 16 and probably p. 12, the length of the lines next above and next below would have prevented a turn-over; the same cause, complicated by a triplet-bracket, operated on p. 21. On p. 33 a turn-over for l. 1 was impossible because l. 2 also exceeded the measure: and an overflow was used for l. 2, to match l. 1. 29 I assume that the copy was cast off, and the text, excluding preliminaries, estimated to fill nine sheets, B-K 8 . The simplest division would then be to allot the copy for the first four sheets to one compositor, and for the remaining five to the other, the original intention being, I take it, that Compositor L should set B, C, D, and E. In the event, Compositor M turned back to help him with D and E. 30 Similar evidence from shortage of W's is employed by Robert K. Turner, Jr., 'The Printing of Philaster Q1 and Q2,' The Library , 5th series, 15 (1960). Warned by D. F. McKenzie, 'Printers of the Mind,' Studies in Bibliography , 22 (1969), 15 f., 18 f., 28-40, I am aware that it presumes a compositor working continuously on the pages in question. But since L and M appear to be completing a rush job, the assumption here should be a safe one. 31 For p. 49, l. 2 (Satyr III, l. 201), Cp. p. 194 and n.17. 32 MS.R., p. 54. 33 Professor David Foxon kindly allowed me to consult him about the possible implications of this bibliographical fact. He is not, of course, responsible for my hypothesis. 34 The Satyr Against Vertue , 1679: see below. 35 MS.R. See footnote 9 above. 36 'Satyr Upon A Woman' ( Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, second issue); 'Paraphrase upon the 137. Psalm', 'Paraphrase upon the Hymn of St. Ambrose' ( Some New Pieces , 1681), and 'Upon a Printer' ( id. , second issue); the ode on Jonson, and the 'Dithyrambique' ( Poems, And Translations , 1683). Cp. MS.R., pp. 54-60, 21-26, 45-53 a , 61-64 b , 32-44, 205-211, 213. 37 For assistance in checking and tabulating authorial and compositorial spellings I am indebted to Dr. Leba Goldstein. 38 Oldham once has 'homag', but it is in a crowded marginal note: in the text opposite, the spelling is 'homage'. 39 'A Satyr Against Vertue' with the 'Apology' annexed: MS.R., pp. 2-19. 40 Eg. 'chast', 'sence', 'soveraign', 'aw', 'brest', 'spite', 'Tho'', 'marr', 'interr', 'summ', 'shamm', 'bin'. 41 Oldham has 'foreign' (1), 'forreign' (3), 'forrein' (2), and 'forein' (2). 42 That is, 'ne'er' (18) vs. 'ne're' (13) and 'nere' (5). 43 These double-consonant spellings in 1681 are probably all derived from the autograph copy-text. Oldham has 'pitty', 'disswades', 'attone', 'awfull', 'painfull', 'allmost', 'Chapple', 'byass', 'deterr', for example. But his practice is very varied: e.g. 'uncontroul'd', 'dazling', 'foretel'. 44 See above, footnote 6. 45 The printer's autograph copy, unlike the extant autograph, may have had 'Favourites'; the word occurs six times in MS.R, three with the 'our' and three with the 'or' spelling. 46 Oldham is not absolutely incapable of the spelling 'virtue', but in MS.R he uses it only in two marginalia, where he has picked it up from his source for the first. This, on p. 249, is a quotation from Dryden's All For Love , 1678. The spelling is repeated on p. 250 in a phrase adapted from Otway's Don Carlos . 'Virtue' there is Oldham's word, not Otway's, but the spelling is obviously influenced by the one from Dryden just before. 47 My figures for 'sense' (absent from MS.R) are: Compositor M, 10; Compositor SJ82, 12; Some New Pieces , 15; Poems, And Translations , 16; Remains , 6; and for 'sence', MS.R, 41; M, 3; SJ82, 4; Some New Pieces , 19; Poems, And Translations , 3; Remains , 7. 48 Cp. footnote 46, above. 49 See above, footnote 3. 50 See above, footnote 26. 51 In MS.R, pp. 2-19. 52 Cp. p. 15 f; pp. 213-215, 218. 53 My search for variant formes in Poems, And Translations , 1683, is still not quite completed. But K Inner is uncorrected in a copy in my possession, while in the Folger, Harvard, and W. A. Clark (Los Angeles) copies, it is corrected, with ' Guillim ' for ' Guilliam ' on K3 v , and 'T has' for 'Tas' on K8r. 54 The hypermetrical and awkward line: But who has kill'd been often clapt, and oft has rhim'd (in Poems, And Translations , 1683, p. 167), no doubt results from 'often' having been placed in the margin as a revision of 'oft has', and then mistakenly inserted before 'clapt'. 55 In 'The Passion of Byblis' l. 100 ( Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, p. 124) where But Honour, Shame and Blood alike forgot: becomes, in the second edition, 1682: But Honour, Blood and shame alike forgot: 56 Oldham probably recollected Virgil's simile ( Aeneid XII 908 ff.): ac velut in somnis . . . . . . . nequi quam avidos extendere cursus velle videmur et in mediis conatibus aegri succidemus 57 'On the Death of Mrs Katherine Kingscourt', l. 40 ( Remains , 1684, p. 33). 58 'Call' is the reading of D Outer ( Satyrs Upon The Jesuits 1681, D3 v ) uncorrected; it is corrected to 'tale' in other copies. See above, pp. 17f. 59 Satyr I, ll. 218 f. ( Satyrs Upon The Jesuits , 1681, p. 16); 'Macguire', in Oldham's draft, MS.R, p. 283.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">English Editions of French Contes De Fees Attributes to Mme d'Aulnoy by Nancy and Melvin Palmer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1785 when Clara Reeve looked back seven or eight decades and recalled Mme d'Aulnoy as "a famous composer of Fairy Tales," 1 she was correct in singling Mme d'Aulnoy out for special attention as an author of contes de fées , but she did not know that twenty-eight of the tales which came into England under Mme d'Aulnoy's name were by four other French writers. Nor has any other literary historian noticed this fact. 2 Furthermore, the 1699 edition of d'Aulnoy tales listed by Arundel Esdaile is regarded today as a bibliographical ghost. 3 In other words, except for the English collections of Fénelon's and Charles Perrault's fairy tales, 4 the French fairy tale in England is a subject fraught with bibliographical confusion. These problems stand in the way of a comprehensive study of the English vogue for French fairy tales in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. This vogue was in fact initiated by Mme d'Aulnoy in 1691 with the translation of a fairy tale of hers as The History of Adolphus , which appeared, however, without author's or translator's name and which was regarded until recently as a native English work and not a translation at all. 5 After this beginning and excepting the English versions of fairy tales by Fénelon and Perrault, the French conte de fée as a genre came to England in four collections, all of them said to be Mme d'Aulnoy's work. Only two are completely the work of Mme d'Aulnoy; the other two contain tales by other hands as well as tales by Mme d'Aulnoy. These four collections are Tales of the Fairies (1699); Volume IV of The Diverting Works of the Countess D'Anois , this volume bearing as title Tales of the Fairies in Three Parts Compleat (1707); The History of the Tales of the Fairies (1716); and A Collection of Novels and Tales of the Fairies (Volumes I and II, 1721; Volume III, 1728). The purpose of this brief study is to suggest a resolution to the problem of the 1699 bibliographical ghost and to tabulate the contents of these four collections, identifying the authors of the tales they contain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tales of the Fairies (1699) Esdaile lists this book as Mme d'Aulnoy's and cites the Term Catalogues , where one finds this notation: "trans. from the Fr. T. Cockerill. 1699, 12°." 6 No copies of this book are known, and Joseph Tucker has even assumed that it was a bibliographical ghost. 7 There are good reasons to believe, however, that the book did indeed exist and that it contained four fairy tales, all in fact by Mme d'Aulnoy. When the next collection of fairy tales appeared in England in Mme d'Aulnoy's Diverting Works of 1707, the publisher said in the preface that there was already an edition of Mme d'Aulnoy's fairy tales ("first part") in English but that it could not be obtained and was thus reprinted in the Diverting Works , together with two other parts of her fairy tales. He then placed symbols (daggers) in the table of contents by those tales never before published in England. Four of the tales in this table stand without such marking; these four tales come from Tome I of Mme d'Aulnoy's French original, the 1697 Contes des fées . The omission of marks suggests that the four tales had already appeared in English. It would appear, therefore, that the 1699 edition cited in the Term Catalogues and by Esdaile was an actual book and not a ghost, and that it contained translations of the four tales of Tome I of Mme d'Aulnoy's Contes des fées : Gracieuse et Percinet , La Belle aux cheveux d'or , L'Oiseau bleu , and Le Prince Lutin .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diverting Works , Volume IV (1707) The Diverting Works collection includes the nine tales of Tomes I and II of Mme d'Aulnoy's Contes des fées (1697) and the eleven tales of the Chevalier de Mailly's Les Illustres fées , which had appeared anonymously in France in 1698. 8 Mme d'Aulnoy: Graciosa and Percinet (Gracieuse et Percinet) The Fair One with Golden Locks (La Belle aux cheveux d'or) The Blue-Bird (L'Oiseau bleu) The Hobgoblin Prince (Le Prince Lutin) Verenata (La Princesse Printanière) Rosetta (La Princesse Rosette) The Golden Bough (Le Rameau d'or) The Orange Tree and the Bee (L'Oranger et l'abeille) The Good Little Mouse (La Bonne petite souris) Chev. de Mailly: (This section of the Diverting Works is subtitled "The Tales of the Fairies, or, the Illustrious Fairies.") The White Beauty (Blanche belle) The Royal Magician (Le Roy magicien) Prince Roger (Le Prince Roger) Fortunio (Fortunio) Guerini (Le Prince Guerini) The Queen of the Island of Flowers (La Reine de l'isle des fleurs) The Favorite of the Fairies (Le Favory des fées) The Well-Doer, or, Quiribini (Le Bien-faisant, ou Quiribini) The Princess Crown'd by the Fairies (La Princesse couronnée par les fées) The Baffl'd Stratagem (La Supercherie malheureuse) The Inaccessible Island (L'isle inaccessable) That the eleven tales of de Mailly were not universally accepted as Mme d'Aulnoy's is made apparent in the 1716 History of the Tales of the Fairies , where "B. H." (the translator and author of the book's preface) maintains that there are several tales in existence "which go under the name of the Countess d'Anois's Tales, which indeed are spurious . . . ." 9 Indeed, de Mailly's stories clearly lack the gentle charm that colors Mme d'Aulnoy's tales and are quite a bit shorter. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The History of the Tales of the Fairies (1716) The 1716 collection contains seven of the nine tales from Tomes I and II of Mme d'Aulnoy's Contes des fées (1697), four of which had appeared in English in 1699 and 1707, and three of which had appeared in 1707: (The tales are misnumbered in the table of contents and in the text.) Graciosa and Percinet (Gracieuse et Percinet) The Blue-Bird and Florina (L'Oiseau bleu) The Fair Indifferent; or the Hobgoblin Prince and Furibon (Le Prince Lutin)—Not listed in table of contents. Prince Avenant and the Beauty with Locks of Gold (La Belle aux cheveux d'or) The King of the Peacocks, and the Princess Rosetta (La Princesse Rosette) Prince Nonpareil, and the Princess Brilliant (Le Rameau d'or) The Orange Tree, and its Beloved Bee (L'Oranger et l'abeille) These tales are drastically abridged—by about one-half to two-thirds—their morals are exaggerated, and many of their episodes are sensationalized. Further, even if limitations of space demanded that "B. H." leave out two of the nine tales of his source, there is no apparent reason for his choice of the two to leave out. 11</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Collection of Novels and Tales of the Fairies (1721-28) This collection appeared in three volumes, the first two in 1721 and the third in 1728. The 1721 portion contains eight tales by Mme d'Aulnoy, the three nouvelles ("novels") she used to frame her tales, and four fairy tales by Mme de Murat 12 (substituted without acknowledgement for four of Mme d'Aulnoy's tales). Following is an analysis of the 1721 portion of this collection: (Except as indicated, tales are from Tomes III and IV of Mme d'Aulnoy's Contes des fées [1697] and Tomes I through IV of her Contes Nouveaux [1698], the last two volumes of this edition also being referred to as Suite des contes nouveaux .) The first three tales are contained in the frame story, "novel," called The History of Don Gabriel : The Royal Ram (Le Mouton) The Story of Finetta the Cinder-Girl (Finette Cendron) The Palace of Revenge (Le Palais de vengeance)—This is a translation of the first tale of Mme de Murat's Nouveaux contes des fées (1698). It replaces the Fortunée of Mme d'Aulnoy's collection. At this point there is a paragraph where the English translator has Mme d'Aulnoy link the last tale with the next and then introduce the two frame stories that will house the remainder of the tales. This paragraph is not in the French original. In fact, the English translator is careful to frame the collection very well; in the French original, some tales stand outside the frame. There follows: The Story of Anguilletta (Anguillette)—Also by Mme de Murat, one of the three tales in her Contes des fées (1698). This story replaces the Babiolle of Mme d'Aulnoy's collection. The next two tales are enclosed in the frame story called The History of Don Ferdinand of Toledo : The Story of the Yellow Dwarf (Le Nain) The Story of Young-and-Handsome (Jeune et Belle)—Another tale from Mme de Murat's Contes des fées (1698). It replaces the Serpentin vert of Mme d'Aulnoy's plan. The remainder of the tales are contained in the frame story The History of the New Gentleman-Citizen : The Story of the White Cat (La chatte blanche) The Story of Fortunio (Belle-Belle ou le Chevalier Fortuné) The Story of the Pidgeon and the Dove (Le Pigeon et la colombe) The Story of the Princess Fair-Star, and Prince Chery (La Princesse Belle-Etoile et le Prince Chéry) The Story of the Princess Carpillona (La Princesse Carpillon) Perfect Love (Le Parfait amour)—the fourth and last du Murat tale, from her 1698 Contes des fées . It replaces Mme d'Aulnoy's Le Dauphin . Volume III of this collection (erroneously called the "Second" edition) appeared in 1728 by itself, that is, without a reprinting of Volumes I and II. 13 This third volume contains twelve tales from the pen of Mme d'Auneuil and one tale whose author has not yet been identified, though the attribution of these tales to Mme d'Aulnoy has persisted down into the twentieth century. 14 The contents of this volume are as follows: Mme d'Auneuil—The frame story (itself a fairy tale) and all seven inset tales of Les Chevaliers errans (1709), called The Knights Errant in English: The Knights Errant (frame fairy tale, containing) The History of the Princess Zamea and the Prince Almazon The History of the Prince Elmedorus and the Princess Alzayda The History of the Princess Zalmayda and the Prince of Numidia The History of the Prince of Numidia The History of the Prince Zalmandor and Princess Almandina The History of the Magnificent Fairy and Prince Salmacis The History of the Fairy of Pleasures and the Cruel Amerdin Anonymous—From Florine, ou la belle italienne, nouveau conte de fée (1713): Florina ; or the Fair Italian Mme d'Auneuil—The frame story (itself a fairy tale) and three inset tales from La Tiranie des fées détruite (1702): (The French original has five inset tales.) The Tyranny of the Fairies Destroyed (frame fairy tale, containing) The History of Cleonice (Not separately titled) The History of Princess Melicerta Princess Leonice As one can see from the above, Mme d'Aulnoy did indeed dominate the English vogue for the French conte de fée , as Clara Reeve suggested. We know now that eighteen of her tales appeared in English before the nineteenth century—a larger number than those of any other writer. But we also know now that twenty-eight of the tales formerly attributed to her in England are the products of other writers. Except for the fairy tales of Fénelon and Perrault, there were no other French contes de fées published in England in the early eighteenth century, but two of the collections discussed here did continue to delight English readers throughout the century. The History of the Tales of the Fairies (1716) appeared again in 1749, 1758, and 1781. The Collection of Novels and Tales of the Fairies (all three volumes complete) appeared twice in 1737 and again in 1749 and 1766. In 1817 it even made its way into the era of Jane Austen as Fairy Tales and Novels .</field>

The French writer referred to is Marie-Cathérine Jumelle de Barneville, Madame d'Aulnoy (ca. 1650-1703), who made contributions not only to the fairy tale but to memoir and travel literature and to the sentimental, pseudohistorical roman and nouvelle . 2 The vogue for contes de fées in France has been studied by Mary Elizabeth Storer, La Mode des contes de fées ( 1685-1700 ) (1928). The corresponding vogue in England has received scant attention. 3 Esdaile, List of English Tales and Prose Romances Printed before 1740 (1912), p. 256.

On de Mailly's authorship of these tales, see Storer, p. 166. 9 "Epistle Dedicatory," The History of the Tales of the Fairies (1716). 10 See Storer, pp. 166-169. 11 That B. H.'s shortened versions were not appreciated in all quarters is indicated by the Preface to the 1721 Collection of Novels and Tales of the Fairies , where "W. C." (perhaps the fairly well-known publisher and writer William Chetwood) maintains that the translators of the present edition "have kept up to the Sense and Spirit of the Author," unlike "the Gentleman that lately gave us a Piece in English of this incomparable Lady's writing . . . ." (pp. viii-ix.) 12 Henriette-Julie de Castelnau, comtesse de Murat, wrote mainly histoires, contes de fées , and some poetry. Because her style is much like Mme d'Aulnoy's, her tales could easily have been taken for Mme d'Aulnoy's. 13 The 1721 edition had been printed for "W. Taylor and W. Chitwood [sic]." The 1728 volume was printed for "J. Brotherton, W. Meadows, Tho. Edlin, and Tho. Astley." 14 Louise de Bossigny, comtesse d'Auneuil, wrote practically nothing but fairy tales. It is not entirely strange that the English translator would choose Mme d'Auneuil's tales to publish as Mme d'Aulnoy's. Since Mme d'Aulnoy's name was spelled variously, the translator might have thought d'Auneuil to be a variant spelling of d'Aulnoy . The anonymous Florina is listed as anonymous in the Silas P. Jones List of French Prose Fiction from 1700 to 1750 (1939), p. 22. The preface to the Cabinet des fées (Genève, 1787-89, p. 395) edition of Florine indicates that the author was a man, but it is simply impossible to hazard a confident opinion on the authorship of this tale. At any rate, it is not Mme d'Aulnoy's.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Museum Attributions in John Cooper's Unpublished Letters by James E. Tierney</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Horace Walpole, David Garrick, and Samuel Johnson represent the most distinguished contributors to Robert Dodsley's fortnightly The Museum; or, Literary and Historical Register , by far the most frequent contributor to the fashionable periodical was John Gilbert Cooper (1723-1769). Until recently, however, only tenuous evidence supported Cooper's extensive role in the Museum's production. In fact, the entire attribution pivoted upon W. P. Courtney's discovery 1 that the 1782 edition of Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands attributed to Cooper three poems which had been signed merely "Philaretes" in all earlier editions of the Collection . A later scholar, 2 realizing that these same three poems had been previously published in the Museum , extended the attribution to include seventeen Museum essays also marked "Philaretes." Attribution made on the basis of such evidence, however, can be no more than highly probable. In an age when publishers frequently failed to distinguish between hearsay and fact, the 1782 identifications, made fully eighteen years after Dodsley's death, could hardly be accepted without question. Dodsley had negotiated for and published the poems twenty-six years before the author's name appeared with them in print. Moreover, it must be remembered that eighteenth-century periodicals frequently used a single pseudonym for more than one contributor. Consequently, it would seem hazardous to certify the authorship of twenty pieces on the basis of three, especially when it involves jumping from one genre to another, from poetry to prose. Now, however, an examination of the author's correspondence with Dodsley 3 during the Museum years not only supports scholarship's earlier assumptions but also discloses two, possibly three, more Museum essays as Cooper's. Cooper expressed his first interest in the periodical even before the initial issue appeared. Writing on March 12, 1745/46, he refers to the announcement of the Museum's publication in the St. James Evening Post and offers Dodsley "any little assistance I can give you." A month later he is making his first contribution. On April 7, he sends the publisher the essay "On Education," and, more significantly, in the postscript requests that "[If] the enclos'd or any other paper I send proves acceptable, [sign] it Philaretes ." Although this single reference tempts one to conclude that Cooper wrote all seventeen essays and three poems in the Museum marked with the nom de plume , such a conclusion would have to remain only probable, however well founded. Happily, though, Cooper's subsequent letters provide more specific evidence for his authorship by mentioning his essays and poems individually by title. Particularly revealing is the letter of February 11, 1746/47. After having contributed many pieces to the Museum during its first year, Cooper writes to Dodsley on this day, indicating his desire to have his Museum essays "collected together, and publish'd" in a "handsome volume in Octavo." 4 To remind Dodsley which papers had been his, he lists individually by title fourteen essays and one poem 5 which had appeared in the Museum signed "Philaretes," an essay signed "Musophilus," another essay signed "Philoptochus," and still another essay which appeared without a by-line at all. These last two have never before been credited to Cooper. The "Philaretes" and "Musophilus" pieces mentioned in this letter include: "On Friendship" (also mentioned in Cooper's letter of April 23, 1746), "The Plebeian Politicians," "A Project for Raising an Hospital for Decayed Authors" by Musophilus 6 (also mentioned in a letter of July 26, 1746), "On the Polite Arts" (also mentioned in his letter of July 7, 1746), "On the Predominant Passion in Women," "On Contentment, A Fable" (also mentioned in the letter of July 26, 1746), "An Epistle from Muli Azareth" (also mentioned in the July 26, 1746 letter), "On Conjugal Love," "On Good and Beauty," "The Vision of Heaven," "On the Death of Socrates," "On Self Love, A Fable," "A Persuasive to Erect an Academy for Lying," "On True and False Religion," and "The Folly of Noblemen and Gentlemen's paying their Debts" (also mentioned in the July 26, 1746 letter). The poem referred to in this letter is Cooper's "Epistle from Theagenes to Sylvia." The two Museum essays never before credited to Cooper which come to light in this letter of February 11, 1746/47 are "On Education" 7 (also mentioned in Cooper's earlier letter of April 7, 1746), and "An Account of the Kingdom of Beggars." These two papers seem to evidence the fact that the Museum's editor, Mark Akenside, did not always abide by Cooper's request to mark all of his contributions with "Philaretes." 8 In the case of "On Education" the anonymous authorship might be explained by the appearance of another Cooper essay, "On Friendship," in the same number of the periodical. Possibly to forestall the impression that Cooper was exerting too strong an influence on the periodical, Akenside thought anonymity best for Cooper's second piece. For the other essay, "An Account of the Kingdom of Beggars," Cooper's letter of November 15, 1746, seems to indicate that Akenside had also supplied the pseudonym "Philoptochus," thinking it more appropriate for the subject of the paper. 9 The author makes a second allusion to this essay when writing to Dodsley on November 15, 1746. Of the three Philaretes essays still unaccounted for here, two—"On Solitude and Society" and "Advertisement"—are specifically acknowledged by Cooper in his letter to Dodsley on February 18, 1746/47. Hence only the Philaretes essay entitled "Two Parliament Speeches" goes unmentioned in Cooper's correspondence. Nonetheless, since sixteen of the seventeen essays originally subscribed "Philaretes" are now clearly proved to be Cooper's, it seems reasonable to assume that the only other essay marked with that pseudonym belongs to Cooper as well. Although completely anonymous, still another Museum essay might be attributed to Cooper not only because of a similarity in content and diction to another of Cooper's essays, but also because of its significant placement in relation to that essay. Topically, "An Essay on True Public Spirit" is a sequel to Philaretes' "Two Parliament Speeches," for both essays carry the same satiric attack on William Pitt during a low point in that statesman's career. Furthermore, not only does "Public Spirit" appear in the Museum just two numbers after "Parliament Speeches," but the use of the rather uncommon word "bowels" in both pieces suggests the same author. Finally, the three poems which Courtney found in the 1782 edition of the Collection , Cooper clearly acknowledges as his own. On July 7, 1746, at the end of a letter to Dodsley, he mentions the first: "I sent by last Saturday's Post . . . a Hymn to Health." Cooper changed his mind on the title of the second poem. On July 26, 1746, he writes: "If you think the Title Bioapotimatist not so proper, you may call it, the Estimate of Life ," which Dodsley did. The third poem, "Epistle from Theagenes to Sylvia," as indicated above, Cooper mentions in his February 11, 1746/47 letter. The Cooper-Dodsley correspondence, then, certifies Cooper's authorship of at least twenty Museum essays and three poems and suggests his authorship of still another essay. Not only is this discovery important for defining Cooper's canon, but it also proves valuable for our understanding of the almost entirely anonymous corpus of the original Museum . For, together with the pieces already attributed to other authors, 10 those now clearly belonging to Cooper permit us to determine the authorship of almost forty percent of the Museum essays and poetry.</field>

Cooper concludes the letter: "I would not have any of the Poetry publish'd." 6 This is probably the eighteenth essay Miss Addington attributes to Cooper. Actually its authorship was revealed when the essay appeared with Cooper's name among Dodsley's posthumous Fugitive Pieces (1765). 7 Another essay, "Of the Knowledge of the World," because it appeared in the very next issue of the Museum and was marked "supplement to Education," tempts one to attribute it to Cooper. However, functioning as negative evidence, Cooper's letter of May 28, 1746, dispels that possibility when the writer is seen asking Dodsley for the identity of the "Supplement's" author. 8 Writing on November 15, 1746, Cooper seems disturbed with this neglect: "I have only time this post to acquaint you that whenever the Directors of the Museum would subscribe a name allusive to the subject of any of my papers, that the mark of Philaretes may be plac'd in the opposite corner besides. For instance if they should sign that Paper I sent you upon lying Pseudophilus , as that upon the Beggar was Philoptochus, I desire you would still remind the Printer not to reject the other mark ["Philaretes"]." Apparently Cooper's pride in his favorite pseudonym could overlook the absurdity of a double signature. 9 See Note 8. 10 Some other contributors include: Mark Akenside, William Collins, David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, Christopher Smart, Joseph Spence, Horace Walpole, Joseph and Thomas Warton the Younger, and William Whitehead.

      <field name="fulltext">The following poems are not listed in the 'Register of Burlesque Poems' at the end of Richmond P. Bond's English Burlesque Poetry 1700-1750 , New York, 1932, reissued 1964, or in A. J. Sambrook's 'Additions to Bond's Register of Burlesque Poems,' SB , 23 (1970), 176-9. The first two poems in my additional list are also cited by Edward Ames Richards in Hudibras in the Burlesque Tradition , New York, 1937, who also cites the one Hudibrastic poem given by Sambrook. Richards lists several poems not mentioned by Bond, but not all of them are burlesque by Bond's definitions. The poem by Ward which is given below is also listed in Howard W. Troyer's Ned Ward of Grubstreet , Cambridge, Mass., 1946. The data for all six poems are given in Bond's pattern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1702 The Visions of Dom Francisco de Quevedo. Villegas. Knight of the Order of St. James. Made English by Sir R. Lestrange , And Burlesqu'd by a Person of Quality. London , Printed and Sold by B. Harris, at the Golden Boar's-head in Grace-church-street . 1702 . pp. 1-284. o.c. Hudibrastic. For his subject-matter the writer stays close to L'Estrange's translation of Quevedo's Visions (1667). What is interesting about the poem is the way in which the writer's burlesque style transforms his material. Here, for instance, is a passage from L'Estrange's translation of the Seventh Vision, "Of Hell Reformed": 'This made me mend my pace; but before I could reach them, they were altogether by the ears in a bloody fray: they were all of them persons of great quality; emperors, magistrates and generals of armies. Lucifer, to end the quarrel, commanded peace and silence, which they all obeyed; but it vexed them very much to be taken off in the full career of their fury and revenge. The first that spoke was a fellow so marred with wounds and scars that I took him at first for an indigent officer, but he proved to be Clitus, as he said himself: . . .' (Francisco de Quevedo, Visions ; As Translated by Sir Roger L'Estrange and Now Introduced by J. M. Cohen , Centaur Press, Sussex, England, 1963, p. 119). In the burlesque, this passage is rendered as follows: Together by the Ears they all In a most bloody Fray did fall: But those engaged, I did see, Were Persons of great Quality, As Emp'rors, Gen'rals, Magistrates , And other topping Blades of States. Lucifer to prevent the Quarrel, Flung at each Wrangler's Head a Barrel, Commanding Peace and Silence there; But to be stopt in the Career Of Fury in the dreadful Fight, Their Lips they all did gnaw and bite; Then an old prating martyr'd Fellow, Who was with drinking somewhat mellow, With a long story did delight us, His Name (as Quintus told) is Clitus .

[p. 3] The narrator-hero successfully exploits this corruption for a time, mainly by seducing the wife and daughter of the "Chief Publican." But things go wrong when he marries another woman, and at the end of the poem he leaves for London in order to expose the practices by which he had temporarily profited. The publican is left describing an ominous dream in which he is visited by a former colleague who has committed suicide: Then from His hollow Trunk a Sound, Which did my shivering Conscience wound; Prepare thou Miscreant to be A Shameful Mark of Infamy.

The " Land-Monster " which the poet attacks is named both " Antimonarchist " and " Anarchy ," and it consists of those several elements in his society which resist "Government." The discursive satire includes many groups, but inevitably concentrates on nonconformists and whigs: These all conjoin'd, as if One Man, Compose this vast Leviathan ; And wou'd with Gospel Texts dispense, As Stumbling-Blocks of great Offence; Because the Holy Pen-Men lay No Shackles on the Word Obey ; (Word to two sorts of Folks abomin-Able, to Whigs and Married-Women ;) But Part with Passive Levites take, Who Suff'ring preach for Conscience-sake.

The poem is a debate with Benjamin Hoadly, Bishop of Bangor, who in 1717 delivered a famous sermon in which he denied that there was such a thing as a visible Church of Christ and stressed the supreme importance of the individual's relationship with God. A major subject of the poem is the nature of prayer, and the form it should take: I own with you, that he's a Wigeon, Who makes a Garb of his Religion, Whose Worship turns on Bows and Cringes Much like a Door upon the Hinges; But yet since Man's a sort of Creature, Or Sound of so complex a Nature, That Flesh and Spirit joyn'd become One physical Compositum: 'Tis fit the Offices and Duties, Concerning which the great Dispute is, Should be in some Proportion equal, Or both will quarrel in the Sequel; . . .

      <field name="heading_text">Warburton's List and Edmond Malone: A Non-Existent Relationship by Anne Lancashire</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1778 Edmond Malone, in his essay entitled "An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in which the Plays attributed to Shakspeare were Written," 1 set down a list of thirty-four "ancient plays," the names of which, he stated, had been preserved, but which were otherwise in 1778 unknown, having apparently never been printed. 2 The recent discovery in MS of Thomas Middleton's The Witch had led him to hope that some of these other old plays might similarly have survived and yet be discovered. "The resemblance between Macbeth and this newly discovered piece by Middleton, naturally suggests a wish, that if any of the unpublished plays, above enumerated, be yet in being, (besides Timon and Sir Thomas More , which are known to be extant) their possessors would condescend to examine them with attention; as hence, perhaps, new lights might be thrown on others of our author's [i.e., Shakespeare's] plays." 3 An indefatigable scholar, Malone had culled his list of titles from a number of older printed and MS sources; three titles, for example— The Cradle of Securitie , Hit the Naile o' the Head , The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom —he apparently found in the extant MS of Sir Thomas More , for they appear together in his list, just above Sir Thomas More itself. The Cradle of Securitie may have come also from another source, R. W.'s Mount Tabor (1639), which Malone knew by at least 1790; 4 but the only known source for the title of Hit the Naile remains to this day the Sir Thomas More MS, which was in fact cited by Malone as his source for both the Cradle and the Hit the Naile titles, in two of his contributions to Isaac Reed's 1782 revised edition, Biographia Dramatica , of David Erskine Baker's 1764 The Companion to the Playhouse . 5 Other sources used by Malone included the Stationers' Register 6 and Chetwood's British Theatre (1750). 7 Malone's list reappeared in later editions of the "Attempt" (published in editions of Shakespeare's plays issued in 1785, 1790, 1793, and later), the list being greatly enlarged in 1785 by twenty-three additional titles, 8 nineteen of which were first printed in Malone's 1780 Supplement to the 1778 Shakespeare edition. 9 (One other title added in the Supplement was dropped in 1785.) One 1778 title, The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom , was removed in 1785, the play's existence in print having by then been discovered. 10 In a recent article in Studies in Bibliography , 11 John Freehafer has suggested that Malone derived about one quarter of the titles in his 1778 list from the now-notorious MS list (with memorandum) written by John Warburton (1682-1759), Somerset Herald, of MS plays supposedly once in his possession and unhappily nearly all destroyed by his servant, who used them for placing under pie bottoms. 12 This list, still extant and prefixed (as in Warburton's time) to the volume of three plays (and a fragment) once owned by Warburton, British Museum MS. Lansdowne 807, had previously been believed to have been unknown to scholars before its publication in Isaac Reed's 1803 edition of Shakespeare's plays. 13 This 1803 printing had been referred to in the 1807 sale catalogue of the Lansdowne library, 14 in Samuel Egerton Brydges' Censura Literaria , vol. 5 (1807), 15 and by W. W. Greg in 1911. 16 Freehafer correctly points out that Reed in fact first published the list in the 1793 fourth edition of the Plays , 17 that Reed's 1782 Biographia Dramatica , to which Malone contributed, 18 also shows definite knowledge of Warburton's list and memorandum, 19 and that nine of Malone's thirty-four 1778 titles are to be found in Warburton's list, 20 while one more Malone title is that of a play once owned by Warburton though not listed by him. 21 Freehafer argues that Malone knew of Warburton's list (and collection) in 1778, used it for his "Attempt," and was the source of the information from it appearing in the 1782 Biographia Dramatica . In fact, however, Malone in 1778 does not seem to have known of the existence of the list, but apparently drew his "Warburton" titles from other sources; and the provider (direct or indirect) of the Warburton material in Biographia Dramatica appears to have been, not Malone, but George Steevens, who was the first to publish Warburton's list, as early as May 1780, in an unsigned letter to The St. James's Chronicle . 22</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Steevens' St. James's Chronicle letter, and Malone's response to it, are the two most important indications that Malone in 1778 did not use Warburton's list in compiling his own. Steevens prefaces his (inaccurate) transcription of Warburton's list as follows: To the Printer of the St. J. CHRONICLE. SIR, It is with Concern I transmit to you a dead List of Dramatick Pieces . Had I met with it early enough for the Use of the Ingenious Mr. Malone, in his excellent Supplement to the last Edition of Shakspeare, it should certainly have been communicated to him. It may now reach him through the Channel of your Chronicle, the Circulation of which is more general than that of any other Evening Paper, as being particularly distinguished by the Correspondence of judicious and learned Men. The enclosed is a Transcript from the Hand-Writing of John Warburton, Esq. Somerset Herald, whose Books were sold (I forget how many Years ago) by Mr. Paterson, at Essex-House. Clearly, then, Steevens—who had edited the 1778 Plays of William Shakspeare to which Malone contributed his "Attempt," and who had co-operated with Malone on the 1780 Supplement 23 —believed the list to have been previously unknown to Malone. And Malone's response to the letter, insofar as we know of it, is also significant; he clipped it out, noted on it that Steevens was the author, and inserted it into his personal, interleaved, annotated copy of Gerard Langbaine's An Account of the English Dramatick Poets (Oxford: L. L. for G. West and H. Clements, 1691), 24 correcting and annotating the list itself, and using it as a reference for at least one of his own annotations to Langbaine. 25 It thus seems unlikely that Warburton's list was in fact previously known to Malone. This conclusion is supported by the existence of two other, obvious, major sources for Malone's knowledge in 1778 of his ten "Warburton" titles: the 1759 sale catalogue of Warburton's books and MSS, 26 and Malone's own annotated copy of Langbaine. The sale catalogue, indeed, provides today the first known recording of the title Demetrius and Marsina , which does not appear on Warburton's list; and though Malone could have used a now-lost source, or simply generally have known about Warburton's collection, the title on Malone's list suggestively appears in the identical form of the title in the catalogue. Malone's use of the catalogue thus becomes likely; and likelihood turns to virtual certainty when we note that the four titles immediately following Demetrius and Marsina on Malone's list are those also immediately following it in the sale catalogue. [from Malone's 1778 list] 27 Demetrius and Marsina, or the imperial Impostor and unhappy Heroine , a tragedy— The Tyrant , a tragedy— The Queen of Corsica—The Bugbears—The Second Maid's Tragedy [from the 1759 sale catalogue] 28 210 Demetrius and Marsina, or the Imperial Impostor and Unhappy Heroine, a Tragedy, fol. 211 The Tyrant, a Tragedy, 4 to 212 The Queene of Corsica, a Tragedy, written by Fran. Jaques 1642 —The second Mayden's Tragedy, Licens'd by the Duke of Buckingham, 31st Oct. 1611—The Buggbears, a Play, very ancient , fol. Malone may have used a transcript of this part of the catalogue, or notes made from it, rather than the catalogue itself; note the different order, in the two lists, of The Second Maiden's Tragedy and The Bugbears , the slightly different Second Maiden's Tragedy titles, 29 and the omission by Malone of some of the information included in the catalogue—though this omission could have been due to Malone's haste or carelessness, especially since the three plays not listed identically in the catalogue and in Malone's list are grouped together in the catalogue as one lot (being bound together in one folio volume). Certainly, however, the catalogue appears to have been Malone's direct or indirect source. Coincidence does not seem a plausible explanation of why Malone's last four play-titles named above, if taken from Warburton's list, where they do not appear together, should have appeared on Malone's list with Demetrius and Marsina in a five-title grouping almost identical to that found in the sale catalogue. 30 Four of Malone's nine "Warburton-list" titles, plus Demetrius and Marsina , can thus easily be accounted for without reference to Warburton's list (or collection itself); what of the remaining five? One, Massinger's Believe As You List , may be from Chetwood's British Theatre (1750); 31 one, The Nobleman , as Freehafer himself points out (p. 160), comes from accounts of court payments, as Malone groups it together with four other, non-Warburton play-titles, all with an acting date of 1613. No performance dates are included in Warburton's list. 32 And the remaining three titles are to be found together in a source very close indeed to Malone: in his own annotated copy of Langbaine, in annotations preceding, in date, Malone's 1778 essay. In 1777 (the date is provided by Malone himself 33 ), Malone copied into his interleaved Langbaine previous annotations to the Account made by three other students of the early English drama: the antiquary William Oldys (1696-1761), the editor Thomas Percy (1729-1811), and Malone's then friend (and later, enemy), the Shakespearean editor George Steevens (1736-1800). To each copied note Malone appended the initial of its original author (O, P, or S), signing his own contributions—then and in subsequent years—with an M. And Oldys' notes, as copied by Malone in 1777, refer to the three Malone "Warburton-list" titles so far unaccounted for (as well as to Tourneur's The Nobleman and to The Second Maiden's Tragedy ): the titles of three plays supposedly by William Rowley, which Malone lists together in the 1778 "Attempt" in the very form and order of the titles in Oldys' note. The three plays do not appear together in Warburton's list. [from Malone's 1778 list] 34 The honoured Loves—The Parliament of Love —and Nonsuch , a comedy; all by William Rowley [Oldys' note as copied by Malone] 35 Rowley wrote the Honoured Loves— The Parliament of Love—and Nonsuch a comedy; but I know not if they were ever printed, and the MSS. are destroyed. Malone's spelling of Rowley's Honourable Loves 36 as Honoured Loves , which Freehafer takes (p. 160) to be Malone's misreading of Warburton's "The Hon r . Loves," in which "the superior letter resembles a 'd'," 37 and therefore as a proof of Malone's use of Warburton's list, is thus doubtless a direct copying by Malone of the Honoured Loves of Oldys' note. 38 Elsewhere in the "Attempt" Malone makes explicit his use of Oldys' Langbaine annotations: in, for example, a footnote reference to Oldys' comments on The Second Maiden's Tragedy . 39 And Malone's list may be indebted to Oldys in two other ways as well. Malone's title-form of Second Maid's Tragedy , found both in his list and in his later reference to the play (p. 336, 1778 ed.), is that of Oldys' Langbaine note, which therefore may have caused Malone's departure from the title-form, Second Maiden's Tragedy , of the Warburton sale catalogue. 40 And Oldys probably also provided Malone with Tourneur as author of The Nobleman —even though Malone first took the title itself from elsewhere. 41 All the "Warburton" plays mentioned by Malone in 1778 can thus be found in sources demonstrably known to Malone in 1778, without reference to Warburton's list, and moreover appear in Malone's list in groups and in title-forms strongly indicating their derivation from these other sources. 42 And, indeed, it is difficult to believe that if Malone in 1778 had had access to Warburton's list he would not have made use of more titles from it. Freehafer suggests (p. 160) that Malone did not because he had reason to suspect that no other of the Warburton plays had survived in MS; but in fact Malone's 1778 list includes plays for the possible existence of which Malone had only the slimmest evidence, and it thus seems most unlikely that Malone would have rejected over forty titles from Warburton's list, if he had known of them. Nor is Freehafer correct in stating (p. 160) that no Warburton-list plays appear in additions to Malone's list after 1778, and in taking this as an indication that in 1778 Malone had considered the other Warburton titles and rejected them as possible survivals; The Woman's Plot , which appears in Warburton's list, was added to Malone's in the 1780 Supplement . 43</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Malone thus almost certainly did not know, in 1778-80, of Warburton's list and memorandum. 44 What, then, of Freehafer's suggestion that Malone contributed to Reed's Biographia Dramatica its information on Warburton's list and on the surviving Warburton plays—Freehafer mentions (p. 161) The Second Maiden's Tragedy and The Bugbears —of the volume to which Warburton's list was by 1759 prefixed? The play information could have come only from examination of the MS volume itself. Freehafer is, of course, assuming that Malone had seen the list and plays in 1778; but could Malone, after Warburton's list was brought to his attention in May 1780, have investigated both the list and the three plays of the volume, and have contributed accordingly to Reed's edition? It seems not—for although, as Freehafer points out, Malone was indeed a contributor to Biographia Dramatica , another contributor (whom Freehafer mentions but then ignores) was George Steevens: 45 the first transcriber and presenter of Warburton's list, and the man who had actually examined, by May 1780, not only the list but also the three surviving Warburton plays of the (present) Lansdowne 807 volume. Steevens displayed his knowledge of these three plays in three more letters to The St. James's Chronicle of May 1780, following his original letter with the transcript of Warburton's list, and gave considerable detail on the text of The Second Maiden's Tragedy (including extracts from the dialogue). 46 The Biographia Dramatica information on The Second Maiden's Tragedy mainly comes almost verbatim from The St. James's Chronicle (and has, until very recently, been the basis of all our knowledge of the play's sources); and Biographia Dramatica entries on The Queen of Corsica and The Bugbears do not include—apart from giving the location of the play MSS as the Earl of Shelburne's library—anything beyond what Steevens wrote in The St. James's Chronicle about those two works, except the provision of an author for The Bugbears (inexplicably not in Steevens' letter on the play, but to be found in Steevens' transcription of Warburton's list). The conclusion that Steevens was the provider, directly or indirectly, of at least most of the Biographia Dramatica information on Warburton's plays and list is thus inescapable. Malone does demonstrably provide a few pieces of information from Warburton's list, 47 but nothing more than could have come simply from perusal of Steevens' transcription of that list.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Finally, Steevens' St. James's Chronicle letter on The Second Maiden's Tragedy raises the interesting possibility of the direct passage of the (present) Lansdowne 807 volume from Warburton's possession to that of William Petty, Earl of Shelburne, first Marquis of Lansdowne. 48 Freehafer states (p. 161) that "Shelburne did not purchase this volume at the Warburton sale"; he logically points out that in 1759 Shelburne was doing military service abroad, and that Shelburne was not known as a serious collector of MSS until the mid 1760's. He suggests that the MS volume of list and plays passed from Warburton to Shelburne via the collector James West (d. 1772). Steevens' 1780 letter refers, however, to Warburton as The Second Maiden's Tragedy's "last Purchaser but one." If Shelburne, who owned the MS by 1782 (as Biographia Dramatica tells us), acquired it from Warburton's successor (as its owner) only between May 1780 and 1782, he cannot have done so from West, who had died some ten years earlier; and if, as is likely, he already owned it in May 1780, he is the purchaser referred to by Steevens as the one following Warburton. Steevens may have been wrong; but his statement obliges us to consider at least the possibility that Shelburne began collecting MSS, perhaps through an agent, as early as 1759, or that the Warburton volume passed almost directly from Warburton to Shelburne, with merely a short, intermediate sojourn in the hands of some professional bookseller. Certainly Freehafer's suggestion that the MS volume passed from Warburton to West to Shelburne is unfounded speculation only. 49</field>

(Malone incorrectly dates the letter June 1780: but perhaps this is the date when he clipped out the letter.) 25 See Malone's Langbaine, vol. 4, opposite p. 532. 26 The catalogue was apparently available in Malone's day; it is cited, for e.g., in Censura Literaria , V, 276-77. 27 Plays 1778, p. 331. 28 Bibliotheca Warburtoniana ([London:] catalogue of books and MSS to be sold by Samuel Paterson, at Essex House, 1759), lots 210-12, under "Miscellaneous Manuscripts," Tuesday 20 November. 29 But see below. 30 It might also be noted that in Biog. Dram . Malone cites Demetrius and Marsina as sold with Warburton's books and MSS about 1759; see Malone's copy, II, 430. 31 Chetwood, p. 42; Malone cites Chetwood on Believe As You List in a note to his Langbaine, vol. 3, opposite p. 359. 32 For Malone's apparent Nobleman source, see Freehafer, p. 160, and the Chamber accounts in MS. Rawlinson A 239, printed in Malone Society Collections VI , ed. David Cook assisted by F. P. Wilson (1962), p. 56. The MS accounts do not, however, give an author for the play; and Malone may have found Tourneur's name where he found 3 other of his "Warburton" titles—in notes by the antiquary William Oldys (see below). 33 Malone's Langbaine, I, 30 (pencil numbering). 34 Plays 1778, p. 331. 35 Malone's Langbaine, vol. 3, opposite p. 428. Oldys' original note is to be found in his own copy of Langbaine (now in the British Museum, C. 28. g. 1), p. 428: "He [William Rowley] writ The Hon d . Loves— The Parliament of Love and Nonsuch, a comedy, but I know not if they were ever printed and the MSS are destroyd." (Oldys knew of Warburton's collection and its destruction—see his Langbaine, pp. 212, 428, 505—but mentions no Warburton plays other than these 3, The Second Maiden's Tragedy , and The Nobleman , and so may not have seen Warburton's list; and he apparently knew about the collection only after its real or supposed loss [see his Langbaine, pp. 428, 505].) Malone added two notes of his own to his Langbaine, following the copied Oldys note: one giving the 1660 Stationers' Register listing of the 3 "Rowley" plays, the second stating that the 3 belonged formerly to Warburton and were destroyed by his servant. Presumably, given the evidence for Malone's ignorance in 1778 of Warburton's list, the second note must be dated 1780 or later. 36 Honourable is the word found in the title's Stationers' Register entry of 29 June 1660, and in Warburton's list; see A Transcript of the Registers of the Worshipful Company of Stationers; from 1640-1708 A.D., [ed. G. E. B. Eyre,] 3 vols. (1913-14), II, 271 [hono b e], and "Bakings of Betsy," p. 230 [Hon r .]. 37 "Bakings of Betsy," p. 230, n., quoted by Freehafer, p. 160. 38 It is true, however, that Warburton's superior letter is misleading; Steevens, for e.g., in his St. James's Chronicle transcription of Warburton's list, reads it as a 'd'. 39 Plays 1778, p. 336 and n. p. Oldys' original note is to be found in his Langbaine, p. 212, and is copied into Malone's Langbaine, vol. 2, between pp. 212 and 213. For other explicit 1778 uses by Malone of Oldys' notes to Langbaine, see Plays 1778, p. 294, n. p, and p. 321, n. z. 40 The Stationers' Register entry of what is probably The Second Maiden's Tragedy , on 9 Sept. 1653, reads " The Maids Tragedie , 2 d part." (Eyre, I, 429), and Warburton's list, "2 d . p t . Maidens Trag̃." ("Bakings of Betsy," p. 232). 41 See above. 42 By 1803 Malone had bought the surviving MS of The Parliament of Love (see Kathleen Marguerite Lea, ed., The Parliament of Love (1929), pp. v-viii); by at least 1790 he apparently knew of its existence (see his 1790 Shakespeare ed., I, pt. 2, 227; but see also below, n. 44, on Malone's 1778 reference to The Second Maiden's Tragedy as extant). Freehafer assumes (p. 160) that Malone owned the MS by 1778; but this cannot be assumed. Certainly Malone did not list it, in 1778, as definitely extant—though consistency is not one of the chief virtues of the "Attempt" in any of its editions. (Cf. Malone's reference in 1780 to his ownership of The Telltale : Supplement , I, 78, n.) 43 Supplement , I, 78. 44 The matter of Malone's ignorance in 1778 of Warburton's list may seem to be complicated by his inconsistency in references to The Second Maiden's Tragedy (one of the plays in the vol. to which Warburton's list was prefixed). Though in his 1778 listing of unpublished plays, pp. 330-31, he implies that SMT is not known to be extant, on p. 336 he refers to SMT as extant. Had he therefore heard after all, by 1778, about the survival of the SMT MS, or seen the play (and thus also Warburton's list)? Probably not; more likely he is on p. 336 simply working from the existence of the SMT MS in Oldys' time, since here he is explicitly using Oldys' lengthy SMT note. Certainly he does not seem to have seen the MS (and its vol.) himself, for he says nothing about the play which cannot be found in Oldys. It might also be mentioned that in the 1785 Plays (see n. 8, above) Malone's "Attempt" was tidied up by the placement of SMT with Timon and Sir Thomas More , in Malone's list of unpublished plays (I, 341-42), as a MS still extant—but the other two Warburton plays of Lansdowne 807 (though written about by Steevens in 1780) were still not included there, nor were they included as extant in the "Attempt" of Malone's 1790 ed. of Shakespeare's works (I, pt. 2, 366). Reed explicitly corrects this omission in his 1793 ed. of the Plays (I, 615-16). 45 For Steevens' contributions, see, for e.g., Malone's notes to his Biog. Dram. copy, vol. 1, opposite p. 404, and vol. 2, opposite p. 118. 46 St. James's Chronicle , 1780: 18-20 May, p. 2 ( Second Maiden's Tragedy ); 20-23 May, p. 4 ( Queen of Corsica ); 23-25 May, p. 2 ( Bugbears ). These letters, like the one of 16-18 May, are unsigned; but the author is that of the 16-18 May letter, and Malone in fact identifies Steevens as author of the 18-20 May letter on the copy of this letter which he inserts into his Langbaine, vol. 2, between pp. 212 and 213. (Malone quotes from this letter in his later "An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the English Stage," included in his 1790 ed. of Shakespeare's works [I, pt. 2 (letter quoted pp. 71-72)] and in later eds. of the Plays .) 47 See Malone's Biog. Dram. copy, II, 431, 433, 442, with reference to Malone's note opposite p. 428. 48 Petty became Earl of Shelburne in 1761, and acquired the Lansdowne title in 1784. 49 During this article's printing, I learned from Mr. Robert Nikirk of The Grolier Club Library that that Library's copy of the Warburton sale catalogue contains the auctioneer's invoice to Philip Carteret Webb for items purchased by Webb from the Warburton collection, and that the list of items includes the catalogue's lot 212—the present B. M. MS. Lansdowne 807. The manuscript volume thus passed from Warburton to Webb, and presumably was one of the manuscripts on paper sold by Webb's widow to Shelburne after Webb's death in 1771 (see the Dictionary of National Biography , ed. Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee (1921-22), XX, 1019), as it does not appear in the 1771 Webb sale catalogue.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Carlyle's Libraries at Chelsea and Ecclefechan by Rodger L. Tarr</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In assembling a bibliography of an author's library one is immediately confronted with the expected problems in compilation, but in the case of Carlyle these issues are compounded by an awareness that a large portion of his once extensive library is, for a variety of reasons, no longer centrally housed. A voracious reader, Carlyle began to gather books in earnest during his student days at the University of Edinburgh, and his endless confrontations with booksellers, then and after, and his continual requests for books from friends attest to his often stated conviction that within a well-defined library is posited the history of man. When this evidence is considered, the obvious question arises—what then became of a substantial part of his library? The enigma surrouding this question is further illustrated when what remains of Carlyle's library is compared to Emerson's (see Walter Harding, Emerson's Library , Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1967), which is approximately ten times the size. And since little of a factual nature is known about the ultimate disposition of many of his books, any answer to the question is as complex as it is diffuse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The only attempt to list the books in Carlyle's library, and notably exclusive of Ecclefechan, is to be found in the Carlyle House Catalogue (London, 1896), which has been reprinted several times, but which is inaccurate and incomplete. However, in spite of its irregularities the catalogue, which was intended for public rather than scholarly use, does provide a key to the disposition of Carlyle's books between his death in 1881 and its initial publications in 1896. Apart from the books related to Oliver Cromwell and Frederick the Great that Carlyle willed to Harvard (see William C. Lane, Bibliographical Contributions : The Carlyle Collection , Cambridge, 1888), his library, or at least the greater part of it, went to his niece Mary Carlyle Aitken and, thus, finally in the hands of his nephew Alexander Carlyle. It is at this point that the history of his library becomes somewhat shrouded in mystery, because the Carlyle House Catalogue records none of the items subsequently sold by the Alexander Carlyle estate in the famous sale at Sotheby's in 1932. The sale itself, of course, provides an additional impasse, for it is now virtually impossible to trace the relocation of the books sold, even though the catalogue does provide a permanent record of what was auctioned (see Catalogue of Printed Books . . . Formerly the Property of Thomas Carlyle , London, 1932).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fairness to Alexander Carlyle, however, it should be noted that the books presently at Chelsea, except in a few instances, are there as a result of his bequest. Yet the question still remains—why did he choose not to leave all the books, or at least the bulk sold at Sotheby's, in the possession of the Carlyle House, Chelsea, where they could be preserved as were Emerson's at Concord? Any attempt to answer this question would be purely speculative, but the question itself provides in part an answer to the regrettable dissemination of a large portion of Carlyle's library. Compounding this fact is Carlyle's known proclivity in old age to give away his books to friends, which in turn has resulted in a plethora of autographed and annotated items finding their way into the hands of private collectors and individual library collections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this tenuous history in mind, it is all the more amazing that a part of Carlyle's library, however depleted, can now be found at his homes in Chelsea and Ecclefechan. And what remains should prove of particular interest to those concerned with his reading and reading habits. The large number of non-English books reflects his early and continued interest in foreign literature, especially German belles-lettres, which provided the impetus for his major work as a biographer, historian, and social critic. The numerous atlases, dictionaries, and linguistically oriented books testify to his synergistic spirit and confirm the eclectic range of his pursuits. Yet one cannot help being dismayed at the absence of works by his contemporaries, who we know presented him with copies of their books, not only out of appreciation and indebtedness, but with the hope that they would meet with his critical favor. Thus, the absence of a significant body of material by Emerson, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Mill, and Ruskin— to name only a few—is especially perplexing and regrettable. On the other hand, annotated material, like the edition of Voltaire, does provide certain compensation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each entry in the bibliography has been checked against the standard library catalogues to insure accuracy and to verify author and title, although in a few cases place of publication and date of issue vary with respect to individual library holdings. As for the annotated portion of each entry, complexity has been avoided by adopting a system of symbols to identify the special characteristics of each item. BP — Carlyle Bookplate. S — Carlyle Signature, unless otherwise noted, with date in parenthesis if given. PC — Presentation Copy, from author or translator, unless otherwise noted. SA — Slightly Annotated, less than ten marginal remarks and/or slashes. A — Annotated, more than ten marginal notations. PA — Profusely Annotated, significant and extensive marginalia. LL — London Library, those books on permanent loan that were once the property of Professor Newberry. E — Ecclefechan, those items now in Scotland; all others are at Chelsea. By way of precaution, final comment should be made regarding the annotated works that are identified by the symbols SA, A, and PA. It would have been desirable, although at once infeasible to record Carlyle's marginalia. Thus, the system of identification of slightly annotated, annotated, and profusely annotated books was adopted to give, as much as possible, an idea of the extent and degree of the marginal comments in any given item. The symbols, however, should be considered as indicative rather than decisive and are not meant as a final evaluation of the importance of Carlyle's marginalia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It goes without saying that a work of this kind owes a great deal to numerous individuals, but I would especially like to extend my appreciation to the National Trust of Great Britain and to Mrs. Hay and Mrs. Swan, executors of Carlyle's homes at Chelsea and Ecclefechan, for their kind cooperation. To Illinois State University my acknowledgment for the grants that aided the initial compilation of the bibliography.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Ellen Glasgow's Virginia : Preliminary Notes by Oliver Steele</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preliminary Materials of one sort or another for a number of Ellen Glasgow's novels are preserved in the Glasgow Collection of the Alderman Library at the University of Virginia. 1 In one sense, the most important of these are the three drafts of the recently published Beyond Defeat , 2 for they are the only full record of what was apparently Ellen Glasgow's invariable working method in the mature period which begins with Barren Ground . In another sense, however, the preliminary notes for Virginia are the most interesting. For although not nearly so extensive as the Beyond Defeat drafts, they represent the earliest stages of a novel which Ellen Glasgow's critics have placed with Barren Ground and The Sheltered Life as the really solid accomplishments of her career. 3 Indeed, one of the best of her critics has compared Virginia favorably with Maupassant's Une Vie and has said, "Par son contenu et par sa forme, Virginia restera son classique du Sud en évolution." 4 Thus these notes show Ellen Glasgow working at full strength toward a novel whose power is undeniable, whereas the various drafts of Beyond Defeat show her working during a period of depression and failing power toward a not very distinguished result. In addition they represent a working method, by plot outlines, essentially different from that used in the composition of the later novels, and perhaps characteristic of her early period. Before discussing what these notes have to tell about Ellen Glasgow's strategy as a writer and about the meaning of Virginia , it is necessary first to say something of the manuscripts from which they were drawn and the style in which they are here presented. For the most part the text is taken from a small black notebook containing one hundred sixty-three pages, all devoted to Virginia . 5 Added to this is a transcript of fifteen loose pages which are from an otherwise lost notebook which must have been exactly the same size as the one which contains the bulk of the material on Virginia . 6 Both manuscripts are in pencil in a hand which seems often hurried and is at times excruciatingly difficult to decipher. Anyone who reads through the notebook which contains most of the material on Virginia will become conscious of what seems a strikingly nervous, elliptical style, reflected perhaps also in the hurried handwriting. There are, to be sure, some pages of fluid and fully elaborated composition, and one would not expect lists of names, articles of clothing, and flowers to be anything but elliptical in their effect. But aside from the few fluid passages, the elliptical quality pervades the entire notebook. This kind of style is perhaps natural for a writer just beginning to set down ideas for scene, character, and action. The earliest notes for Beyond Defeat have this same quality. Perhaps, too, the "nervousness" of the style represents something of the excitement with which a writer elaborates a new idea which has become compelling, but not yet clear. But another factor in the style of these notes was the extremely small notebook (6 7/16" X 3⅝") in which they were written. The fact that there are some fully developed passages proves that the size of the book could not have been of overriding importance for the style of the notes. But probably this small book did provide an appropriate and to some degree encouraging medium for the more important factors that have been mentioned. Since it has been impracticable to present these notes in a line for line reprint of the notebooks, it is hoped that retaining the original and often erratic punctuation of the original will convey some of the flavor of the elliptical style. Four typical pages are reproduced below. For the most part these notes consist of two chapter by chapter outlines of the novel, in which interest in character and motive and interest in plot are about equally divided. There are also a fairly large number of pages devoted to the scenery of the novel, including such things as clothing and furniture. In A Certain Measure Ellen Glasgow wrote: I knew her [Virginia's] life as well as if I had lived it in her place, hour by hour, day by day, week by week; and gradually, I found that her image was blending in contour with the figures of several women I had known well in the past. From the first paragraph in my novel, there was never the faintest haze or obscurity in that long perspective. Not ever was I obliged to pause or wonder what should come next in my narrative, or whither it was leading me. I knew infallibly how she would act or speak, respond or recoil, in any situation. 7 The implication seems to be that the process of composition was made fluid by an utter clarity about character and theme. These notes surely contradict that claim, just as they contradict the statement that she never had to "wonder what should come next in my narrative, or whither it was leading me." The process of composition was simply not what she implies it was. But if the passage is taken to refer to the external events of Virginia's life, then the claim is solidly supported by the notes. They show that from the first, Ellen Glasgow had a firm grasp of the events of her heroine's life, a grasp which was to become still firmer in the second chapter outline. And since, in the final form of the novel, Virginia's character and destiny are the life of the story, this early clarity about the sequence of events in Virginia's life was importantly responsible for the structural coherence of the final version. Although Ellen Glasgow understood Virginia and her history from the first, she was not so clear about some of the other characters in the novel. Indeed, her handling of Miss Priscilla Batte and Miss Willy Whitlow is hardly changed from these early outlines to the final version. But in the case of Cyrus Treadwell, it is clear that at first she planned for him to have an importance in the structure of the novel which would have meant significant changes in his character and, indeed, in the theme of the book. In the early pages of the first outline, Ellen Glasgow identified the theme of the novel as the "transition from an aristocratic to a commercial civilization" (see MS. pp. 2-3). And it appears that she had originally intended Cyrus and his career to be the most overt embodiment of that theme. Consequently she planned a history of Cyrus' rise to power which was to run parallel to Virginia's story throughout the novel. He was to have become a sort of arch-villain of commercial success in a plot which showed him at the end of the war borrowing ten dollars from Gabriel Pendleton and investing it in a herd of hogs, which investment was to become the ignoble basis of his later fortune (p. 35). Then he was to cheat his friend Gabriel by buying from him cheaply some land which he knew was to increase enormously in value (p. 8). By collaborating with a rich carpetbagger, Glade, he was then to acquire a railroad with the help of northern capital (p. 36). But the main part of his history was to have been concerned with a struggle for power between himself and an industrialist and railroad owner named Goode. 8 Goode is mentioned first on the fourth page of the notebook as "a dogged character, who fights on even after he has lost." Later the bare statement that "Goode has no business head" occurs (p. 17), and toward the middle of the first outline, Ellen Glasgow reminds herself that she needs to have a chapter on Cyrus' "persecution of Goode on account of the Appomattox R. R." (p. 40). Then Goode is mentioned again on page forty-seven, and on the next page Cyrus' "triumph over Goode in the shipping of cotton" is noted. On page fifty-eight Ellen Glasgow records again her intention to devote an entire chapter to Cyrus' struggle with Goode, this time to his final triumph over Goode. This victory is mentioned again toward the end of the first outline (p. 79). And still later is found the assertion that Cyrus is broken by Goode's death because he, Cyrus, has nothing to live for (p. 85). Throughout the first outline Goode remains an obscure figure, an almost anonymous victim of Cyrus' will to power. At the beginning of the second outline, however, some concrete information is given about him. He is obviously a strong character, a man who single-handed builds a railroad after the war out of discarded rails, a broken down engine, and ties made from his own lumber (p. 101). He fights stubbornly for the life of his railroad (p. 120). From the clues given about Cyrus' struggle with Goode, one can reconstruct Ellen Glasgow's intention, especially if these clues are taken with some other statements about Cyrus. In the second outline, for instance, Cyrus' method of getting control of the Dinwiddie Railroad is summarized: When people refuse right of way through their lands—brought the cases into court, and when lands were condemned bought them for practically nothing— 9 And in the first outline there is a reference to a scheme, presumably Cyrus', to crush an enemy by allowing his competitor preferential rates on his railroad (p. 59). A minor episode in Cyrus' history was to have been his gaining control of the local newspaper, The Dinwiddie Bee . This episode is first mentioned on page forty, where Honest Tom Tucker, the name originally given to Tom Peachy, editor of the newspaper, is mentioned. And Cyrus' victory over the editor is recorded early in the second outline (p. 121). One last detail will perhaps help our understanding of what Ellen Glasgow intended with Cyrus. In the second outline a chapter is summarized in which Gabriel Pendleton goes to Cyrus to ask him to make his factory safe by putting up fire escapes and improving the stair case, and Cyrus refuses. All of these details show that originally Cyrus was to have been a villain of the Machiavellian stripe, a melodramatic and almost allegorical embodiment of the active principle of evil in commerce and materialism. His victory over Goode was surely to have been the defeat of an aristocrat struggling by all honest means to rebuild something of what he and his society had lost at the end of the war. Similarly his crushing of the editor of The Dinwiddie Bee was to have meant the silencing of a public voice which stood for high ideals and noble sentiments, and the intrusion into public life of all manner of crassness and vulgarity. And all of this was to have been accomplished with the same ruthlessness with which Cyrus cheated Gabriel Pendleton of his land and with which he acquired right of way for his railroad. Clearly also Cyrus' gradual commercial success was to have run parallel to Virginia's personal tragedy. It was to have been a public and external mirror of the private and internal story of the novel's heroine. Almost none of this finds place in the final version of Virginia . Cyrus' character is drastically modified and the history of his unscrupulous rise to power is almost completely eliminated. There were undoubtedly purely practical reasons for Ellen Glasgow's decision not to include an elaborate development of her theme in terms of Cyrus' history. As the outlines show, originally she had planned to devote a number of chapters to that subject, and she probably saw that a treatment of it on the scale she had planned would have meant a book of unconscionable length. Yet, other more substantial reasons must have guided her decision too. She must have seen that so elaborate a treatment of Cyrus and the public victory of commerce and materialism over aristocratic idealism could only weaken the effect of what was from the first her main interest, the character and fate of Virginia. At any rate her decision to abandon Cyrus as villain represents a subtle but important change in the theme announced in the first outline. There she had written: Theme— The struggle between idealism and materialism in the South of the last thirty years. The transition from an aristocratic to a commercial civilization. 10 To a large extent, Ellen Glasgow had abandoned this theme by the time she came to write the final version. For there the emphasis is on a critical, yet sympathetic, examination of the pastoral idealism which formed the character of the aristocratic southern lady. In Virginia this idealism is defeated not so much by materialism as by its own weakness, its inability to respond to the realities of experience, its irrelevance to a life more complex than the pastoral myth of the old South. In this new conception of the theme of the novel, neither Cyrus' history nor his character as evil genius of materialism is very relevant. Consequently his character is reduced from the melodramatic to the realistic level. He is finally characterized by mean-spiritedness and petty tyranny. He becomes a sign of the times, a sign that power had passed from the aristocratic land owner, who could foster a pastoral mythology because he could afford it and protect it, to a new kind of man who was creating a new world and a new mythology. Because such characters as Susan Treadwell and John Henry Pendleton see the demands and opportunities of the new conditions they thrive without losing their humanity. Virginia, on the other hand, lives deep within her myths, seeing neither the demands nor the opportunities of the world around her. She is bewildered by one and frightened by the other. Her tragedy is the pathos of any beautiful but obsolete thing. What Virginia's myths foster, a passive and self-effacing gentleness, an ability to color the ordinary and often shoddy realities with romance, and an unshakeable devotion to her family, is her strength as a character. But as it gives her strength, it also disastrously inhibits curiosity and intelligence, and it is this defect in her character that lies at the heart of her personal tragedy. Even in the outlines, particularly in the second one, Ellen Glasgow had seen this clearly. At the start of the second outline she notes that she needs to treat the "effect of Virginia's unselfishness on his [Oliver's] character" (p. 92). And that effect is noted later in the outline: She had given, but never demanded— Had made the way too easy, had never held him to his ideals. 11 Again in the second outline, Oliver's "irritation at Virginia's lack of artistic sympathy" is noted along with her absorption in "little practical cares" (p. 129). Virginia's strength as a character, her unfailing selflessness and her total devotion to the small affairs of her family, is at the same time her defect, her inability to comprehend her husband's character and ambitions and to provide anything of the stimulation and criticism which he needs. It was because Ellen Glasgow's understanding of Virginia's fundamental defect was so clear that, between the first and second outlines, she totally changed the character of Margaret Oldcastle, the actress for whom Oliver divorces Virginia. Toward the end of the first outline, Ellen Glasgow had written of Margaret Oldcastle: Her last love— her last hold on youth— Life slipping, slipping from her, and the one thing she had wanted she had never had— To feel a great passion for the first time at forty— To watch the lives it burns up. To feel one's self burning to a cinder— And to know that the last chance of happiness is offered one— at forty! 12 But by the beginning of the second outline she had changed this picture of an unscrupulous, passion-driven woman so that she becomes A woman of forty-three, with good impulses utterly uncontrolled— Has never denied herself and having broken the old-fashioned bondage of duty has as yet accepted no other discipline from life— 13 At least now she is allowed good impulses and her lack of control is given a justifying explanation. The final modification, which in fact formed the basis of the actress's characterization in the final version, occurs toward the end of the second outline: Generous in fits, impulsive, kind-hearted— forty-three— not voluptuous— a hard working intellectual actress, who had kept passion outside of her life. 14 These modifications of Margaret Oldcastle's character show Ellen Glasgow progressively sharpening her concept of Virginia as a tragic figure. They show her deciding to make Virginia's tragedy a matter of her own character, rather than of external circumstance. As it turns out, Margaret Oldcastle represents what Oliver needs, and cannot find in Virginia, a tough and lively intelligence and an active, outward-thrusting personality. One last example will show how, in the process of writing these outlines, Ellen Glasgow made minor characters effective for the development of her theme. Aunt Belinda, the wife of Cyrus Treadwell, is first described as "an idealist crushed by compliant materialism" and by "the triumphal car of success" (p. 31). She is also called a "doting mother," for whom her children had the greatest contempt (p. 32). In the second outline Ellen Glasgow talks of "poor spiritless Mrs. Treadwell" and of her "mental and physical slovenliness" (p. 112), and finally of her terror of her husband and of "her pitiful clinging to little pieces of the past" (p. 114). In the second outline one can see the "crushed idealist" and "doting mother" of the first outline being transformed into the pitiful psychological wreck of the final version. In the process Mrs. Treadwell becomes one of the three women who function as mirrors of the heroine's character and situation. The chief of these is Virginia's mother, who represents what is best in her character and in the pastoral idealism which formed her. 15 Another is Mrs. Tom Peachy, whose eternally cheerful fortitude makes it possible for her to support a husband whose chief occupation since the war has been drinking. She represents something of Virginia's situation after the collapse of Oliver's early ambitions. Then Belinda Treadwell, the darkest of these mirrors, begins to cast her somber light on Virginia at the end of the novel as her tragedy reaches and then passes its crisis. These three women, all creatures of the same myths that give Virginia her consciousness, work out in their lives the implications of the ideal of the southern lady, implications which are developed more subtly in the life of the heroine. The changes in character and incident which have been discussed so far can all be explained by supposing that during and after the writing of the two preliminary outlines Ellen Glasgow's thinking about the theme of her book became clearer and clearer. On the other hand, the outlines show a confusion about the character of Oliver Treadwell which was never entirely resolved. This lack of clarity about Oliver is the least satisfactory thing about the final version, and the outlines show in direct and simple terms what the nature of the confusion was. 16 In the first outline it is clear that Ellen Glasgow saw Oliver as an embodiment of the announced theme of the struggle between idealism and materialism. She first describes him as a "Treadwell turned artist" (p. 33), and on the next page clarifies that comment by calling him a "materialist turned romantic." Then about the middle of the first outline she notes "the complete and final adjustment of Oliver to present conditions" and calls this adjustment "materialism triumphant" (p. 67). At the end of the first outline she summarizes her conception of Oliver's character: In Oliver materialism and idealism struggle and materialism conquers in the end. 17 In fact, this struggle is not of any great importance in Oliver's character, though traces of it remain in the final version to weaken his credibility. At the crucial moment of his life the real struggle is between two forms of idealism. As an artist his idealism is utopian, as Ellen Glasgow herself notes in the second outline (p. 113). That is to say, the thrust of his ambition is outward into the present. He hopes to bring his civilization to a recognition of the truths of reality by a devastating attack on its illusions. His love of Virginia, who represents the illusory view of reality in its most radical form, is directly opposed to his ideals as an artist. Throughout the two outlines and in the final version as well Ellen Glasgow explains Oliver's character in terms of a decline from his original ideals to a complacent acceptance of the cheap values of contemporary society. At the beginning of the first outline she writes: Oliver's character is developed from an ardent rebel against the powers that be into a complacent servitor of them— His first treachery to his art has its effect upon his whole moral nature— gradual deterioration of character. 18 And in the middle of the second outline she adds: The effect of failure and poverty on Oliver— Tries his hand at a different sort of play— Gradual yielding to public standards— His whole character shows the results of his compromise— 19 Yet his decline is implicit in his marriage to Virginia, which reveals him as a man who has "the temperament of genius without the quality" (p. 9). And Ellen Glasgow fails fully to grasp this fact. She does, in both the outlines and the final version, rather ignore it, and she can write: Oliver surrenders Accepts position on railroad in West Virginia in order to marry— Still holds his advanced theories and still remains true to his art— 20 One other aspect of Oliver's character never became clear in Ellen Glasgow's mind, and that is his saving grace of cynicism and bitterness. She treats this quality instead as simply a part of the general degeneration of his character. 21 It is, however, the only thing that saves him from a life both complacent and unauthentic. One critic has supposed that Oliver's prospects at the end of the novel are bleak, 22 and I think Ellen Glasgow would have agreed. Yet if one gets outside the author's absorption in the tragedy of her heroine, his prospects do not look bleak at all. How could they be with a woman so magnificently alive as Margaret Oldcastle. His refusal to accept complacently his failure as a man and as an artist makes possible in the end what looks like a genuine rehabilitation. When one looks carefully at the outlines and then at the final version of Virginia , one can see that Oliver interested Ellen Glasgow as a character in his own right, as a type of the gifted but immature artist who has to pass through failure and disillusionment to arrive. Yet so concerned was she with the life of her heroine that she willingly used Oliver as an expedient for elaborating her primary interest. In the process she obscured his motives and character. It remains now to describe the extent to which these outlines form the basic material of the finished novel. For in spite of the changes and omissions that have been discussed, the shape of the novel is fundamentally that given it in the outlines, and it is fascinating to follow the process by which the details, scenes and descriptions of the outlines were taken into the final version. Some passages were used almost without modification. The description of Miss Priscilla Batte which occupies pages thirteen through sixteen of the first outline is the most considerable of these. 23 But the description of the parsonage and of the Treadwell's home in the loose notes are similarly appropriated. 24 A fairly long passage from the first outline which treats Cyrus as a worshipper of convention is used verbatim, 25 as is another from the same outline which describes the naive assurance of perpetual happiness with which Oliver and Virginia enter marriage. 26 More interesting even than these examples of unchanged intention from outlines to novel—I have mentioned only a few—are the many passages which acquire a new status as they pass from the outlines into the novel. Perhaps the most interesting of these is a passage from the second outline which was originally planned to come toward the end of the novel after Oliver had asked Virginia for a divorce and she had returned from New York to Dinwiddie: She had asked only one thing in life— the traditional position of woman— She had never rebelled against the circumscription of her lot— rather had she embraced its very limitations— The position which society had assigned to women, she had accepted not only with resignation but with rejoicing— 27 In a much modified version this passage is used to describe Virginia's state of mind just before her marriage. 28 And one can speculate that Ellen Glasgow found the passage more appropriate for a subtly ironic treatment of young Virginia's idyllic expectations than for the portrait of a woman who had become self-pitying in defeat. Another interesting example of the transformation of material from the outlines occurs at the end of the first outline. At the end of the second outline Virginia's son "finds her in a city square. Takes her into a cheap restaurant and coaxes her to eat." and the story ends "with the triumph of motherhood and filial love—" (p. 156). Fortunately, the novel does not end with any kind of triumph, but just what kind of triumph Ellen Glasgow had in mind may perhaps be seen in the ending of the first outline, a part of which reads: A magic like that magic of first love The magic &amp; exaltation of first love pulsed in her veins while she stood there— &amp; in the midst of the arid space of the square— She smelt the scent of honey suckle blooming on that June afternoon almost thirty years ago— 29 Undoubtedly the author realized that Virginia's tragedy had to be genuine, not to be redeemed, or rather cheapened, by a false happy ending. Consequently, in the final version she used the passage quoted, not at the end of the novel, but rather in a scene in which Virginia desperately and pathetically attempts to escape the harsh fact of Oliver's desertion by recreating in fancy her happy youth. 30 Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the early drafts of a gifted writer is that they sometimes record the stages by which, for the writer, the hypothetical and abstract become concrete and actual. Occasionally we can see characters ceasing to be simply names and descriptions of qualities and features to become instead imitations of life who confront the writer with their own appropriate voices and gestures. William Faulkner once explained that what he did was to follow his characters about and take down what they said. If not every talented writer has Faulkner's uncanny ability to hear his characters saying the right things in the right way, still it is there to some extent, and it is what makes the writer's imitation credible. Even in these early notes one can occasionally see characters begin to claim their own identity and to say the things that they would inevitably say. The most interesting, because it is the clearest, example occurs early in the first outline where Ellen Glasgow is making rather unorganized notes on theme and character. She writes: Virginia, the Southern woman of the old regime— I'm thinking about those men I killed, Lucy Honest John Tucker used as a tool by Cyrus— Editor of Dinwiddie Bee— In his thin black alpaca coat 31 In the midst of these unconnected and abstract jottings, Ellen Glasgow hears Gabriel Pendleton, the Christian soldier, speak the regret that he sometimes feels "in the dead of sweltering summer nights." 32 And its very lack of connection with anything around it suggests that it came to her forcefully, as an unmistakable expression of the man's character. Similar examples occur in the second outline, where Ellen Glasgow records the opening lines of one of Virginia's letters to her mother, 33 and catches Cyrus Treadwell in a characteristic retort to an appeal to his nobler nature. 34 Although I have discussed what seemed to me the most interesting features of these preliminary notes for Virginia , other scarcely less interesting features have been undoubtedly neglected. Those who admire Ellen Glasgow's work will, for instance, find the nine separate versions of the opening scene of the novel fascinating, and they will want to follow the way in which small details of scene, appearance and action are taken into the final version of the novel. In a sense, everything in these notes is significant for an understanding of Ellen Glasgow's imagination and art. It remains for me to say something of the method used for representing interlineations and deletions in this edition. Interlineations from the notebooks are brought down into the text in italics after the word or words in the text that they are meant to modify or amplify. Deletions in the notebooks are represented in this edition in square brackets. Occasionally I have not been able to decipher Ellen Glasgow's hand. On such occasions, a conjectural reading has been supplied within pointed brackets. 35</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Owen Wister's Roosevelt : A Case Study in Post-Production Censorship by Elizabeth A. Swaim</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An interesting case study in the bibliographical variations possible in an ordinary twentieth-century American trade book occurs in the story of Macmillan's last-minute recall before publication of Owen Wister's Roosevelt : The Story of a Friendship 1880-1919 (1930) and their hasty and expensive replacement of an entire sixteen-page section, before redistributing the expected best-seller with a new publication date. Investigation of the circumstances of this unusual post-production editing sheds light on yet another aspect of publishing which may prove a trap for unwary bibliographers. Wesleyan University Library was recently given a copy of the early uncensored state of Wister's reminiscences of the colorful President by the former Macmillan West Coast manager, who had kept out this copy after receiving the publisher's telegraphed request for a return of the shipment unopened and who believed his action—and consequently this copy—to be unique (although in fact they were not). The threat of a lawsuit, made only after the first printing of Roosevelt had been distributed to booksellers and reviewers all over the country, necessitated Wister's eleventh-hour rewriting of more than five full pages of text as an innocuous substitution for a potentially libelous episode, the consequent reprinting of an entire section (that comprising pages 91 through 106), and its insertion in place of the original in the already bound volumes. 1 A comparison of this new acquisition with the copy of the first printing which has been in Wesleyan's stacks since July 21, 1930, reveals the offending material as an episode taking place during Roosevelt's 1902 visit to Charleston, South Carolina. At line 9 on page 98, following the words "the strict orders that the President was to enter no private house in Charleston," the early state went on: "and the steps which a very clever and ambitious lady took in consequence." This latter phrase was deleted from the published version, in which no further mention was made of Theodore Roosevelt in a private house while in Charleston. Pages 100 through the first two lines on page 105 in the early state elaborated on the earlier allusion; in them, Wister (who was then living in Charleston) recounted the ruse by which this clever and ambitious lady, married to a Charlestonian but regarded by the local ladies with suspicions both general and specific (including the paternity of her child and the authenticity of a visiting French female novelist), persuaded the President to take a cup of tea in her house by telling him that such a gesture would make happy the last days of an old servant of hers, a former slave. Mention of the lady was entirely omitted from the published version of Wister's book, in which pages 100 through the first two lines on page 105 were newly written and devoted to several harmless anecdotes describing what was left of "the ancient Charleston of fine traditions and fierce prejudices." 2 No other changes were made in the text of the sixteen-page section, although the makeup of pages 98 and 99 was revised to close up the two-line deletion on page 98. No indication of any amendment appears in the book; the versos of the title-pages in both states read: "Set up and electrotyped. Published May, 1930." The lack of an index precludes any faulty references. 3 A book on such a popular subject as the former President by such an established writer as Owen Wister was bound to attract attention in 1930. Excerpts from it had appeared in five consecutive issues of the Saturday Evening Post beginning on March 22, as well as in the May and June issues of Harper's Magazine . Widely reviewed, 4 the biography was assigned to the front page of the Sunday New York Times book section on the 15th of June, two days before its scheduled publication. Obviously difficulties over its publication would be newsworthy. A story in the New York Times for Friday, June 20 (p. 48), reported that Wister's Roosevelt had been with-held from circulation because of an anonymous complaint made through an attorney and that both the family and the publishers denied that the objections came from the Roosevelts. A week later (June 27, p. 26) it was reported that Macmillan had recalled the book from booksellers and reviewers, and the "persistent rumor" was cited that the objections came from the family of the late President Wilson, Roosevelt's unfavorable remarks about whom had been quoted by Wister; the official reason given by Macmillan for the recall was "so that changes which Mr. Wister desired could be made." The next day (June 28, p. 16) a denial of the Wilson rumor was made by Ray Stannard Baker, speaking in a telephone interview for members of the Wilson family, who he said were in the habit of ignoring such critical remarks which "are inclined to die of their own venom." The front page of the Times for the 9th of July carried a two-column story headed "Tale of a southern hoax on Roosevelt caused the recall of Owen Wister's book" and announced that the book would go on sale the next day in a revised form. "It was, after all, no weighty revelation of State secrets, no criticism of contemporary statesmen that led to the book's withdrawal," wrote the anonymous reporter; instead it was a "pretty story told against a background of wistaria vines, garden parties and pompadours" of an alleged ruse to get the President to visit a certain hostess' house during his visit to an unnamed Southern city a quarter of a century earlier. The reporter quoted some lines from the end of the offending episode and hoped that they were not removed (they were). Where he got his information for the story is unclear, since he noted that Macmillan was maintaining a policy of silence about the real nature of the circumstances. The thick folder on Owen Wister for 1930 in the Macmillan Company Records 5 sheds further light on the situation. A letter from a Washington attorney, threatening a libel suit on behalf of his client, her daughter, and her husband, because of the material on pages 98-105, 6 arrived on Monday, June 16th, the day before the book's scheduled publication. George P. Brett, Macmillan president, had gone to Florida for several weeks, after writing to Wister on the 11th that advance reviews looked good and that they were going into a second printing that day, even though 1930 was a dull year for the book business and summer was a slow time in any year. Wister himself was in Europe, and it took several days for a frantic cable to reach him. In a long letter to Brett dated June 19th, Wister wrote that he was astonished at the idea of a libel suit and thought it was probably a bluff, since the joke was entirely on the President and the lady would be identified by few after nearly three decades, but that it seemed wiser to change the text than to risk a suit. On June 23rd George Brett, Junior, Treasurer and General Manager of Macmillan, and Wister's three children cabled Wister that legal advice recommended omitting the episode and asked him to write nineteen hundred words about Charleston which might fit in; the book could be published a week after receipt of his cabled substitution. On June 26th the attorney wrote a letter of appreciation to Brett, in reply to his of the 24th saying the change would be made and a new date of publication set. 7 Wister's thirty-seven page cablegram, sent for discretion's sake through the Bankers Trust offices in Paris and New York, was received on Saturday, June 28th, marked up as printer's copy, and sent to the printer on Monday; the new publication date was set for the tenth of July. That others were aware of the early Roosevelt's rare book value is seen from an initialed note dated July 8th, apparently from a reviewer, saying that he was returning his copy to Macmillan by ordinary mail, although "as it may some day be worth untold millions in the hands of Dr. Rosenbach I suppose I should register it." In late August a Tulsa bookseller who had faithfully returned his early copies wrote Macmillan complaining that he had been offered one by a leading New York bookseller for a hundred dollars. By mid-September Whitman Bennett wrote the publisher that the supposed rarity had become quite common. A reply from Brett said that they too had been offered copies, at prices ranging from five to a hundred dollars, that two or three hundred were unaccounted for, and that they supposed most of them were reviewers' copies, since few of these had been returned. Such speculation was short-lived, largely because public interest in such a minor controversy could not be sustained. American Book Prices Current listed three sales of the book during 1931 at prices from $20 to $37.50 and one in 1932 for $15.50. Copies of the first issue sold in 1936 and 1939 for seven and five dollars respectively and have been recorded once or twice in each succeeding decade at similar prices. The biography is not, however, a title which would ordinarily be checked for price record or bibliographical history, and one wonders whether most present-day owners of the remaining uncensored copies know of the book's history and the complications arising from a comparatively unimportant and soon-to-be-forgotten episode in the narrative. While the censorship involved in Wister's Roosevelt is no different from that performed on many books by their editors before setting up in type, its occurrence is unusual after a book has been produced and initially distributed. And since there is little chance of recovering this history except through accident, the interesting larger question is raised as to how many other such seemingly ordinary books have had similar bibliographical histories which we may never discover. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The sewing of this section in the early state is the same as that of all other sections (i.e., five long double stitches in the center of the fold), while that in the later state consists of sixteen quarter-inch single stitches, apparently catching the threads of the original sewing at the spine, with the inner margins of pages 91 and 106 lightly tipped to the adjoining sections to give greater holding power to the reprinted and insecurely-inserted section. In the one copy of the second printing (dated June 1930) examined, the sewing is normal throughout. 2 Ironically, the rewritten material follows immediately after Wister's account of Roosevelt's insistence that he suppress the episode about the gouging of a horse's eye from the story of Balaam and Pedro in his best-selling 1902 novel The Virginian . 3 The most conveniently verifiable point by which to distinguish the two states is the beginning of page 100, which in the first reads, "I went to my desk and re-wrote the page," and in the second, "Of Charleston at the time when Roosevelt came there." Merle Johnson, in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions (1932, 1936, and 1942) of American First Editions , notes: "First state has Karow for Carow at head of prolog. P.100 begins: I went to my desk etc." 4 The offending episode, with its comparative lack of interest to the general public, was not singled out by reviewers, and it had been considered expendable from the account of the Charleston visit in the March 29th Saturday Evening Post . 5 Preserved in the Manuscript Division, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. My thanks to Peter M. Rainey and other Division staff members who made it available to me. 6 Presumably seen in a review copy. 7 The next day, in one of the most extraordinary aspects of the case, the client herself, Cornelia Calhoun, wrote from Chevy Chase, Maryland, congratulating Macmillan on their decision and announcing that under separate cover she was forwarding a copy of her own book ( Autobiography of a Chameleon by "Daisy Breaux," printed that year by the Potomac Press in Washington) and that she would call on Brett when next in New York. Two days later she wrote that she was hoping he would publish her new novel, but a letter dated from New York's St. Regis Hotel on the first of July said that she had decided it needed some revision before he was to pass on its merits. No such novel is listed in the National Union Catalog , but her Knight of Liberty appears in the 1930 Catalog of Copyright Entries , Books, Group II (i.e., Pamphlets, leaflets, etc.), no. 26546, as published in Washington on the first of July and registered on the 23rd. The only Group I book registered by her between 1930 and 1949 was Favorite Recipes of a Famous Hostess in 1945. 8 E.g., at the end of 1970 Wesleyan, doubtless along with most other libraries, received a request from a New York attorney to return any first printing of M.R.D. Foot's S.O.E. in France (London, HMSO, 1966) in exchange for a copy of the second printing of 1968 in which certain allegations against his client and some of her colleagues had been removed. Not unexpectedly, except to the lawyer and his client, few libraries seemed to have complied with their first such request made two years earlier.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Stephen Crane and "Corporal O'Connor's Story" by Gillian G. M. Kyles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his introduction to a facsimile edition of the 1894 New York Press appearance of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage , Joseph Katz quotes an April 2, 1893, letter of Crane's in which he relates that he spent ten days writing a war story (always identified as the first version of the Red Badge ) that he now thinks he will have to 'do all over again.' 1 Professor Katz remarks: "This first attempt is lost. Perhaps part of it survives in the barely legible fragment of 'Corporal O'Connor's Story,' a scrap of paper in the Butler Library [Special Collections, Columbia University Libraries] which refers to a 'Delsartean' philosophy and a young man fresh from his studies. The paper seems right, the handwriting, the protagonist, and the philosophical stress seem right, but the brief glimpse is sufficient for speculation into only what-could-have-been." 2 Both recto (containing the notes) and verso (containing the jotting 'Corporal O'Connor's Story') are reproduced, but not transcribed. The notation 'Corporal O'Connor's Story' is not readily identifiable but may have some relation to an unfinished early manuscript about the Twelfth Cavalry and the Indian wars which has as its protagonist a Corporal Smith. The paper, a cheap wove, appears to be the same in each; the present manuscript measures 249.5 x 140.4 mm. (the horizontal measurement does not allow for a stuck-down crease running the full length of the page, reducing the width by at least 20 mm.) and the 'Twelfth Cavalry' manuscript measures 249.5 x 162.5 mm. The handwriting of the two manuscripts is markedly similar and is unlike the later, tighter hand of the Red Badge manuscript, which was inscribed on legal-size ledger paper; and indeed it much resembles that of "Across the Covered Pit" in the Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia which may be dated 1890. 3 The text appears to be notes or a draft of a news story dating from Crane's Asbury Park days as assistant to his brother Townley, who was correspondent for the New York Tribune . Insofar as the words can be determined, the fragment reads as follows: Delsartean systim and the[n made] inquiries as to [which] methods made &lt; &gt; philosophy prominen[ent] about ten years [ago] In the fall of 18[6]9, Mr Steele Mc[Kaye] fresh from his studies with Mr. Franco[is] &lt; &gt; Delsarte, came to this country and François Alexandre Nicolas Chéri Delsarte (1811-1871) was a French drama and singing teacher who invented a system of calisthenics to develop co-ordination, power, and grace on the stage. Among his students was James Morrison Steele MacKaye (known as Steele MacKaye), an American actor and dramatist, who studied with Delsarte towards the end of the master's life and brought the system to the United States where he taught it in his drama school. The reference to MacKaye and to Delsarte establishes that Crane was writing about a method of acting and not about a philosophy of war. In short the inscriptions on the two sides of the paper have no relation to each other. During the summers of 1890-92 Crane assisted his brother by covering, among other events, the actvities of the Avon Seaside Assembly, where Madame Alberti, the Dean of the School of Expression (part of the Assembly complex), lectured regularly on the methods developed by Delsarte and taught by MacKaye. She and her husband William had been friends of the older Cranes and Crane may well have met them socially as well as in his function as cub reporter. Crane reported her lectures for several years. For example, in an attributed dispatch "On the Banks of the Shark River" in the Tribune for July 11, 1891, one reads: "Madame Alberti in the School of Expression taught the correct use of the muscles of the arm and wrist. . . . The pupils of Madame Alberti have been rehearsing the Greek play 'Electra,' which is to be given in August." 4 A report next year on September 6, 1892, is more specific: The hall now rings with the merry voices of Mme. Alberti's pupils who come here to be taught Delsarte. Mme. Alberti is the dean of the School of Expression here. Dozens of young ladies come to this resort merely to attend her lectures. The "Delsarte Girls" are a familiar feature of the Avon-by-the-Sea landscape. 5 It is probable that Madame Alberti would have mentioned MacKaye in one of her lectures in the years 1890-92 and that Crane, functioning as a reporter, repeated her reference although the news report that resulted from these notes (if it was printed) has not been identified. Whatever the significance of the jotting of a title on the other side of the leaf, the fragment has no connection with The Red Badge of Courage .</field>
