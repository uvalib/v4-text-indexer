      <field name="heading_text">External Fact as an Editorial Problem by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Keats in his sonnet on Chapman's Homer wrote of "stout Cortez," rather than Balboa, staring at the Pacific with eagle eyes, he created what has become the classic instance of a factual error in a work of imaginative literature. Yet few readers have been bothered by the error or felt that it detracts from the power of the sonnet, and editors have not regarded it as a crux calling for emendation. Amy Lowell, after mentioning the possibility that Keats was thinking of Titian's painting of Cortez, dismisses the matter: "at any rate he put Cortez, probably by accident. It is no matter." 1 Classroom editions of Keats have often included some similar comment, such as Clarence DeWitt Thorpe's note that begins, "Historically, 'Cortez' should be read 'Balboa,'" and ends, "Poetically, it does not matter; the poem is true and magnificent." 2 Scarcely anyone would dispute Thorpe's conclusion that the poem is "true and magnificent," as it stands, or would advocate the substitution of "Balboa" in it. But the consensus of opinion on the question does not mean that no significant issues are raised by it. The view that an historical error does not detract from the greatness of a poem is of course grounded on the argument that an imaginative work creates its own internal world for the communication of truth: the work can express a "truth" relevant to the outside world without being faithful to that world in the details out of which the work is constructed. No one is surprised by the expression of this principle, which is, after all, central to an understanding of literature as metaphorical statement. What is less often considered, however, is the complexity of its editorial implications. Certainly a critical editor cannot take as a general rule Thorpe's comment that "Poetically, it does not matter." Whether or not a particular error matters depends on more than whether or not it occurs in a poem or a "creative" work: sometimes a factual error in a poem may indeed call for correction, while at other times it may not, and the editor must decide which is the case in any given instance, and why. If "Cortez" need not be or should not be corrected, the reason is not simply that factual inaccuracies are necessarily irrelevant to the artistic success of poems; the reason must instead focus on why it is either impractical or unwise to make a change in this particular case. Is "Cortez" so much a part of the pattern of versification as to rule out an alteration to a word of so different a sound as "Balboa"? Does "Cortez," calling up in the reader's mind the early days of the Spanish in Central America, manage to convey the meaning that was intended—or, at least, is it not too far off the mark to prevent the reader from grasping that meaning? (If the word, through some error of transmission, had been misspelled in such a way as not to be recognizable as "Cortez"—resulting perhaps in a name with no allusive significance or one with an inappropriate association—what would the editor do?) Or, on another level, does the long familiarity of the "Cortez" reading have any bearing on the editor's feeling that a change cannot now be contemplated? If so, does it make a difference whether the traditional, if unfactual, reading is one (like "Cortez") known to have been written down by the author or whether it is one whose origins are less certain? However simple or obvious it may seem at first to say that the "Cortez" reading should not be disturbed, questions of this kind are inevitably involved. The editor of a critical text sets out to eliminate from a particular copy-text what can be regarded as errors in it; defining what constitutes an "error" is therefore basic to the editorial procedure. Any concept of error involves the recognition of a standard: an editor can label certain readings of a text erroneous only by finding that they fail to conform to a certain standard. Determining appropriate standards for editorial judgment must take into account the nature of the piece of writing as a whole and the nature of each individual passage in it as well as the nature of the edition that is to result, and it must recognize that errors may fall into discrete classes, each demanding different treatment. One may feel that errors of historical fact, for instance, should be corrected in some kinds of works (or passages) and not in other kinds, but that decision involves some consideration of authorial intention and will thus be affected by the attitude that the edition is to take toward questions of intention. If the goal of an edition—as with most scholarly critical editions—is to attempt to establish the text intended by the author at a particular time, one's decisions about what constitutes errors will be affected accordingly. Intention and error are inseparable concepts, because errors are by definition unintended deviations (unintended on a conscious level, that is, whatever unconscious motivation for them there may be). If a writer intentionally distorts historical fact for the purposes of a work, that distortion is not an error in terms of the work, nor is it a textual error from the editor's point of view. An editor must distinguish, however, between accepting factual errors because they are intended features of a literary work and accepting them because they reveal the mental processes of the author. The latter interest is a legitimate and important one, but it may conflict with the aim of establishing the intended text of a work. Both interests can be accommodated through the use of textual notes, but one of those interests must be chosen as the rationale for the editor's treatment of the text itself. If one's aim is to reproduce the text of a particular document, then obviously one reproduces it errors and all, for the errors may be revealing characteristics of the author's direction of thought and in any case are part of the historical record to be preserved. But if one's aim is to offer a critical edition of that text as a finished literary work, one can no more follow a policy of retaining all factual errors than pursue a course of correcting all such errors. In a critical edition the treatment of factual errors can be no mechanical matter, covered by a blanket rule; instead, the editor must give serious thought to the circumstances surrounding each one, thought that will involve settling basic questions about the nature of the editing being undertaken. Errors of external fact are of course only one category of the larger class of discrepancies in general. Many discrepancies in texts are internal: that is, certain readings are identifiable as errors not because they fail to agree with recognized facts but because they are inconsistent with points established elsewhere within the text. When, for example, Minnie Mavering is referred to as "Molly" in Howells's April Hopes or Tashtego is called "Daggoo" in Moby-Dick , 3 the discrepancies are matters of internal, rather than external, fact. The authors in these cases cannot have intended to refer to their characters by the wrong names, and the editor of a critical text will rectify such errors. Not all internal errors can be corrected by the simple substitution of a name, however. As alert readers have long noticed, the Pequod is described early in Moby-Dick (Chapter 16) as having a tiller ("Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm") but later in the book is given a wheel helm with spokes (Chapters 61, 118—in which the helmsman is said to "handle the spokes" and "ostentatiously handle his spokes"). Similarly, Pip is referred to as an "Alabama boy" (Chapter 27) and is told that a whale would sell for thirty times what he would in Alabama (Chapter 93); but there is also a reference to his "native Tolland County in Connecticut" (Chapter 93) and his father "in old Tolland county" (Chapter 99). Melville evidently did not intend these discrepancies, but a scholarly editor who attempts to eliminate them faces the difficult problem of guessing how Melville would have rewritten the passages. In some instances of this kind the editor's educated guess may be the best solution, but often the wiser course is to let the discrepancies stand. It should be clear, however, that the editor who allows such errors to remain does so only in the belief that nothing better can be done and not because they are regarded as part of the author's intended text. Internal errors resemble external errors in the sense that they are recognizable by reference to something outside the immediate context: a reading in one sentence (or phrase) is erroneous or discrepant because it fails to match what is said in another sentence (or phrase) elsewhere in the work. But the "external" facts in such instances are still within the limits of the piece of writing, and the author's intention with respect to the internal consistency of the work is made clear to the reader in the work itself. The editor is normally in a position to know, in other words, whether the world of the work is a realistic one, in which a person named Minnie cannot suddenly become Molly and a wheel cannot change into a tiller, or a surrealistic one, in which such "facts" are not stable. In the case of allusions that extend outside the limits of the work, however, the editor is in a more difficult position. Because the reference is to something with an independent existence, one is faced with the question whether the author is attempting to be accurate in citing an external fact or is adapting it so as to give it a new existence within the work. Errors of external fact, therefore, pose quite a different problem from internal discrepancies. They are worth investigating in their own right and because they lead one to consider the fundamental assumptions of editing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I One of the most common situations involving external allusion occurs when a writer quotes from an earlier piece of writing. Insofar as the emphasis of the reference is on a verifiable independent source, the quotation should be exact. But insofar as the writer's intention is to adapt the quotation, it becomes a created element in the new work and cannot then be deemed incorrect merely because it fails to correspond with an external source. In many cases the motivation is mixed: the writer wishes to call on the authority of a previous author (expecting readers to recognize the author or the work cited) but at the same time wishes to alter the quotation to serve a particular purpose in the new context. Of course, a writer sometimes simply misquotes without intending to, and if no consequences follow from the misquotation, it is merely an error and nothing more; but if the misquotation becomes the basis for discussion or implication, then it has become an integral part of the new work, whether the misquotation was consciously intended or not. 4 Many of the possible editorial problems involving quotations can be illustrated by a single famous instance, the section of "Extracts" prefixed to Moby-Dick . In this section Melville draws together eighty quotations, ranging from the Bible to mid-nineteenth-century fiction, constituting a massive epigraph to the book. One might at first feel that epigraphs are not part of the text they introduce and that there would thus be no legitimate reason for their not being accurate; but a moment's reflection reminds one that an author selects an epigraph in order to set up a relationship between its implications and those of the text to follow and that one should not be surprised, therefore, if the epigraph were intentionally slanted to make the relationship clearer. Epigraphs are as much a part of a text as the quotations embedded in it. In the case of Melville's "Extracts," the creative nature of epigraphs is evident: the sweep of the assembled material is intended to suggest the greatness and universality of the subject of whales and whaling. 5 Melville furthermore places his quotations in a dramatic framework: they are said to be "Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian," who has "gone through the long Vaticans and streetstalls of the earth" in search of them. The fact that supposedly they have been prepared by a created character does not, of course, mean that any errors in them must necessarily be accepted as contributing to the characterization, but it does strengthen the point that misquotations may at times be functional, and intentionally so. Whether misquotations are in fact intended as part of a characterization can only be determined by the context, and in this instance there is nothing to indicate that Melville wished the reader to regard any errors as lapses on the Sub-Sub-Librarian's part; on the other hand, he may well have wished to alter certain quotations to make them more appropriate as epigraphs to the work that follows, and misquotations in the "Extracts" must be judged critically with this possibility in mind. 6 A survey of some of the editorial questions raised by the "Extracts" can provide a convenient introduction to the issues involved in dealing with external references in general. Perhaps the most straightforward situations are those in which misquotations result from obviously intended alterations by Melville. In the second extract, for example, from Job 41:32, the wording of the printed text 7 (the manuscript does not survive) exactly matches that of the King James Bible except that "Leviathan" is substituted for "He" in "Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him." Clearly no one, in the process of transmission from manuscript to print, could have misread Melville's "He" as "Leviathan"; furthermore, the indefinite reference of "He" calls for some explanation when the passage is quoted out of context. It seems certain that Melville wrote "Leviathan," intentionally altering the wording of his source. Similarly, the extract from Montaigne contains the clause "the sea-gudgeon retires into it in great security," whereas the passage in Hazlitt's Montaigne (Melville's source) reads "this little fish" instead of "the sea-gudgeon." Again, the change cannot have resulted from a misreading of handwriting. Although it is perhaps conceivable that Melville wrote "sea-gudgeon" as a result of losing his place momentarily—since "sea-gudgeon" occurs in an earlier (unquoted) part of Montaigne's sentence—it is much more likely that he wished not to lose this term and substituted it in what is otherwise essentially an accurate quotation. Even undistinctive words can sometimes be recognized as Melville's alterations: the extract from Waller consists of two couplets, separated by a row of asterisks indicating ellipsis; in the second couplet "his" (twice) and "he" appear, rather than Waller's "her" and "she"— substitutions obviously made so that the gender of the pronouns would match that in the first couplet, now that the two couplets are juxtaposed (in the original, forty lines separate them). 8 In instances of this kind the editor of a critical edition will retain what are in fact misquotations, recognizing that the aim is to reproduce Melville's intended form of the quotations. (The accompanying apparatus should of course inform the reader in each case of the relation between the source passage and the passage of text being edited, for the retention, as well as the alteration, of an "error" in a quotation constitutes an editorial decision that must be put on record.) Thinking about these examples leads one to see some of the conditions under which emendations in the "Extracts" would have to be made. Unintended slips—authorial, scribal, compositorial—can be present in the text of the "Extracts" just as in the body of the book, and a critical approach to the text demands that all "misquotations" be evaluated and not automatically accepted as intended alterations. When, in the quotation from Blackstone, "caught near the coast" appears instead of "caught near the coasts," and, in the extract from Frederick Debell Bennett, "these weapons" replaces "those weapons"—or when the passage from Uno von Troil contains "lime-stone" instead of "brim-stone"—the substituted word in each case could easily have resulted from a simple transmissional error (such as a memorial lapse or a misreading of handwriting), and in none of these cases does there seem to be any reason for an authorial change. A number of such examples occur in poetic quotations from prominent sources: in the second extract from Paradise Lost , Leviathan is said to be stretched like a promontory "in," rather than "on," the deep and to spout out a sea "at his breath," rather than "at his trunk"; and in the extract from Cowper we read that "rockets blew [rather than 'flew'] self driven, / To hang their momentary fire [not 'fires'] / Around [not 'Amid'] the vault of heaven." All these misquotations are conceivable misreadings of handwriting or slips in copying, and it is difficult to see why Melville (or anyone else) would wish to make them intentionally ("fire" for "fires" is a clear instance of error, because the word is supposed to rhyme with "spires" two lines earlier). Slips of this kind, which probably occurred in the process of transmission from authorial manuscript to printed book, call for emendation by the critical editor. Of course, some of these erroneous readings may have been present in Melville's manuscript, but as long as they can be argued to be unintentional slips the case for emendation is not altered. 9 When the printed text reads "Hosmannus" at a point where the name in Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica is "Hofmannus," the error may well have been Melville's own: since he was probably using his copy of the 1686 edition and was accustomed to transcribing long s as "s," he may have mistaken the "f" in this proper name for a long s . Some instances are less clear-cut but still make the same point. A line from Elizabeth Oakes Smith is printed in the "Extracts" as "A mariner sat in the shrouds one night," although the original reads "on the shrouds." The reading "in" could simply be a scribal or compositorial misreading of Melville's "on"; but it is also possible that Melville wrote "in," not because he wished to alter the wording but because he was not copying carefully, the "in" perhaps coming naturally to him as the more idiomatic wording. Unless there is reason to believe that Melville intended to revise the quotation—which seems unlikely here—the possible presence of the "in" in his manuscript should not deter the editor from emending to "on." 10 In other words, whenever the possibility of a misreading of handwriting or of an authorial slip outweighs the possibility that the misquotation is an intended one, the editor seeking to establish what the author wished will emend to correct the quotation. Whatever interest there may be in Melville's writing "Hosmannus" and "in the shrouds"—if indeed he did so— belongs to a different level of concern; such evidence will be preserved in the notes but does not belong in a text aimed to satisfy another concern. An additional example or two may serve further to clarify the role of arguments based on possible slips or misreadings of handwriting. In the Smith quotation, four lines after "in the shrouds," there is the clause "it floundered in the sea," where "it" refers to "whale"; in the original the subject is "he," not "it," but here the conservative editor is likely to feel that the possibility of an intentional change is enough stronger to warrant the retention of the "it." This misquotation could of course have been a mere slip, but at least a misreading of handwriting does not seem to be involved in this case, and that in itself lends some weight to the argument against emendation—though it cannot be the decisive factor. The opening line of the extract from Waller reads "Like Spenser's Talus with his modern flail," but the adjective in Waller is actually "iron," not "modern." There would seem little possibility that "modern" could result from a misreading of handwriting (or from a slip of the pen, for that matter); but "modern" makes no sense, and the editor may well take the position that the word cannot have been intended (even if its presence as an error cannot be explained) and that an emendation is in order. The argument is somewhat strengthened by the fact that Melville a few years later, in "The Bell-Tower," referred to Talus as an "iron slave." But this information is fortuitous: the point is that the editor's critical judgment carries more weight than inconclusive speculation about the transmissional process. That "modern" cannot be explained as arising from a particular kind of error of transmission does not mean that it must therefore be retained by a conservative editor, if that editor considers the change unlikely to have been intended by the author. The critical editing of a text must extend to the quotations that are a part of the text. Because quotations have external sources, the editor has access to one more stage of antecedent document at these points than elsewhere in the text and thus is in a more informed position for detecting erroneous readings. The process of locating those external sources, however, raises some important questions of editorial procedure. First is the problem of deciding what particular edition of a source text is the proper one to use for comparison. If the text of a quotation in the "Extracts" matches the text of the corresponding passage in the first edition of the work quoted from, the problem does not exist, for it does not matter whether Melville used the first edition or some other edition, as long as the resulting quotation is accurate. 11 But when the text in the "Extracts" does not correspond with that of the first edition, one cannot assume that the difference necessarily results from a transmissional error in the process of writing and printing Moby-Dick or from a deliberate change on Melville's part; it may be that Melville copied accurately, but from a different edition. If so, the editor's thinking about the passage will be affected, and it is therefore important to know, if possible, the immediate source of each quotation. Yet in the case of many classics that have gone through numerous editions and have been excerpted and quoted even more often the editor cannot be expected to have searched through all possible sources. It is conceivable, for example, that Melville happened to take the Waller passage from a secondary source that misquoted "iron" as "modern"; but an editor cannot begin to find all the places where Waller's lines may have been quoted and has no choice but to proceed on the basis of the available knowledge. Frequently, however, an editor will know some of the favorite sources that an author is likely to use and may even have some information about the particular copies read. That Melville's ninth extract—identified only as " Other or Octher's verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King Alfred. A.D. 890"—comes from Robert Henry's The History of Great Britain (1771) is not difficult to learn when one knows that J. Ross Browne's Etchings from a Whaling Cruise (1846), one of Melville's principal sources, also quotes this passage; furthermore, it is clear that Melville took the passage directly from Browne, and did not go back to Henry, because his extract agrees with Browne in reading "this country" at a point where the first edition of 1771 reads "these parts." A similar instance is the extract from Bunyan, which does not reproduce the relevant passage from the 1682 edition of The Holy War but instead follows the wording (except for a sixteen-word ellipsis) of a paraphrase of this passage in Henry T. Cheever's The Whale and His Captors (1849). 12 The question that all this leads to is how the editor should handle errors or alterations that were already present in the immediate source of the quotations. If Melville quotes a corrupt text under the impression that he is providing the reader with another author's words, is it part of an editor's duty to replace that corrupt text with an accurate text? Answering this question goes to the heart of the concept of scholarly critical editing. Expecting editors to make such "corrections" of quotations is in effect asking them to establish the text of each quoted passage so as to fulfill its author's intentions. Such a procedure would mean treating each quotation as if it were an individual item in an anthology, not a part of a context created by another writer. The reader comes to Melville's "Extracts" not to seek established texts of Waller and Bunyan but to see what Melville does with those authors; the editor's job is to establish Melville's versions of Waller and Bunyan, which may turn out to be considerably different from the texts that would appear in scholarly editions of them. If a corrupt text of a quotation is the one that Melville knew, responded to, and wished to set before his readers, then that text is the intended one under these circumstances. Emendation may be necessary if it is clear that the copy-text version of a quotation contains readings unintended by Melville, but the test for emendation is not whether the readings were unintended by the original writer. In order to be in a position to make intelligent decisions on this question, an editor is obviously required to perform some textual research among editions of the quoted work: if the copy-text version of a quotation does not match the text of the first edition of the quoted work, the editor must attempt to locate another edition that does match, for otherwise there is no basis for judging whether the variants were present in Melville's immediate source or originated at a later point (either in his own copying—intentionally or inadvertently—or in the succeeding steps of transmission). The scholarly editor must be able to draw the line between restoring an author's intended wording of a quotation and collaborating with the author by pushing the process of "correcting" the quotation to a point never contemplated by the author. To claim that Melville intended to quote accurately is not to the purpose: aside from the historical question of the degree of accuracy implied at a given time in the past by the act of "quoting" (discussed below), this claim mixes up different kinds of intention. That Melville may have "intended" in advance to quote accurately the sentiments of various writers does not alter the fact that the scholarly editor's concern is with Melville's active intention as he wrote, reflected in the quotations themselves. 13 The immediate sources he accepted and used become the authoritative sources for the quotations in this context. Thus the extract from Thomas Fuller's The Holy State, and the Profane State reads "mighty whales which swim" at a point where the first edition of 1642 and the "second edition enlarged" of 1648 read "mighty whales who swim"; but because "which" is the reading of the London 1841 edition—the edition borrowed by Melville, according to Merton M. Sealts's Melville's Reading (1966)—there would seem to be no reason to emend. The editor is not called upon to investigate whether any authority could attach to "which" as a reading in Fuller's text, for Melville evidently copied accurately the wording of the passage that struck him in the 1841 edition; whether or not that wording corresponds exactly to Fuller's intention is irrelevant, because it is the wording that Melville encountered and used. In the case of the Waller extract, if an edition or secondary source available to Melville could indeed be found containing the phrase "modern flail," no emendation would be required, however peculiar the reading seems, because the passage with that reading in it would be the one that Melville reacted to and found appropriate for inclusion in the "Extracts." Until such a source is found, however, the inherent unlikelihood of the reading will weigh more heavily with an editor than the theoretical possibility that Melville came upon the reading somewhere; the editor is acting responsibly if, after a reasonable search in Waller editions and books known to have been used by Melville, the reading is regarded as an error to be emended. Some textual research is nevertheless clearly necessary. An editor who looked only at the original 1645 edition of Waller's Poems would find that the line reads "Like fairy Talus with his iron flail" and might conclude that "Spenser's Talus," as well as "modern flail," is an erroneous reading (though possibly one intended by Melville to identify the allusion). But a little further research would reveal that "fairy" was changed to "Spenser's" in the 1664 edition and would thus place "Spenser's" in a different class of readings from "modern." Without such textual investigation, editors are not in a position to make informed judgments; but pursuing that research by no means implies that they are shifting their focus from the intentions of the quoter to those of the quoted. 14 A related element in considering a writer's intentions in making a quotation is an understanding of the contemporary conventions of quoting. Generally before the twentieth century (and in some cases even into the century) quotations were not thought of as "inaccurate" or "incorrect" if they occasionally departed from the wording—to say nothing of the punctuation and spelling—of the source, as long as they did not distort the gist of its meaning. It was not considered wrong, even in expository writing (that is to say, writing not usually classed as "imaginative" or belletristic), to place between quotation marks what we would now think of as a paraphrase or an adaptation. For an editor to make such "quotations" conform to modern standards of accuracy, therefore, would be to modernize (that is, to employ a modern approach—for the corrected quotation would often be less "modern" in form); and the scholarly editor will not wish to engage in modernizing here any more than with the punctuation and spelling of the rest of the text. In checking Melville's extracts against their sources, then, an editor need not be concerned with spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or other formal matters except to the extent that discrepancies markedly affect meaning (or obviously result from slips or nonauthorial styling) or that agreements point to Melville's immediate sources. It clearly never occurred to Melville to be troubled about taking a twenty-word middle section out of a long sentence of Davenant's and beginning it with a capital letter; or juxtaposing, without ellipsis marks (and actually in reverse order), two sentences from Bacon's History Naturall and Experimentall of Life and Death (1638) that are in fact separated by six of Bacon's "Items"; or running together two lines of verse without indicating the line break, as in the extracts from Bacon's version of Psalm 104 and from I Henry IV. When Melville inserts "Fife" in parentheses after "this coast" in his quotation from Robert Sibbald and "whales" in parentheses after "these monsters" in his extract from Darwin, he is using parentheses to mark explanatory insertions in the way that we would now use square brackets. 15 An editor who injects ellipsis dots, virgules, and brackets into these quotations is modernizing, by requiring Melville's quotations—and each of the extracts is in fact printed in quotation marks—to conform to present-day standards. The place for showing these relationships between the quotations and their sources is the textual apparatus or other editorial end-matter; in the text itself the scholarly editor will wish to respect nineteenth-century customs in the use of quotation marks (and what they imply about the enclosed material) just as much as nineteenth-century practices in placing apostrophes, commas, and other punctuation. This custom of allusive quotation is represented among Melville's extracts by a wide diversity of situations, which thus help further to define the nature of the accuracy that is attempted. In addition to substitutions, which often could be the result of a slip of the pen or a misreading of handwriting, there are instances of insertion, omission, and paraphrase that cannot reasonably be considered inadvertent. For example, the extract from the account of Schouten's sixth circumnavigation in John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca (1705) begins, "Here they saw such huge shoals of whales," whereas the passage in Harris reads "saw an incredible number of Penguins, and such huge shoals of whales." Obviously Melville wished to omit the six words after "saw" as irrelevant to his purpose; deleting the reference to penguins focuses more attention on the whales, but Melville saw no reason to note his ellipsis. 16 Similarly, in the quotation from Jefferson there is an unmarked omission of fifty-one words between the subject and the verb; the sentence from Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet's Journal (1831) silently omits eleven words; and five are left out of the sentence from James Colnett's Voyage (1798). 17 Sometimes omissions and substitutions occur together, as when four words are omitted and four other alterations are made in the sentence from Richard Stafford, causing it to refer only to one man and one whale instead of to a group of each. The motivation for some of these changes is not always as obvious as in the omission of the reference to penguins or the insertion of "Whale-" in "The Whale-ship Globe" (the extract from William Lay and Cyrus Hussey), but there can be no doubt that such alterations are intentional and that they did not, in Melville's view, prevent the results from being regarded as "extracts" from the works named. Indeed, passages placed in quotation marks could depart even further from the originals and consist entirely of paraphrase: the sentences from Stowe, Boswell, and James Cook are far enough from the original wording that they have to be considered paraphrases made by Melville (unless he was following secondary sources that have not yet been located). And the first sentence of the extract from Uno von Troil was apparently constructed by Melville's rearranging parts of the original sentence. It is impossible to analyze precisely the various reasons underlying these changes; but it is clear that the desire to alter passages so as to emphasize their connection with whaling is not the sole explanation. The pattern of the extracts as a whole shows that the concept of what constitutes "quotation" here is a much looser one than present-day writers are accustomed to. As in any other piece of writing, intention is ultimately defined by the work itself, and the extracts, as a group, establish their own standards. When Melville's departures from his sources result simply from his practice of approximate quotation, they cannot be thought of as "unintended." Errors, to be emended editorially, can certainly be located in the extracts, but the process of identifying them must be founded on an understanding of the level of accuracy attempted in the first place. (And in a scholarly edition the information used by the editor for determining this level will be available to the reader in the notes that record or explain the differences between the extracts and their sources.) Melville's twisting of quotations for his own purposes—beyond any customary casualness in quoting—does, however, play a significant role in producing the wording found in the "Extracts." When Melville paraphrases a passage, places the result in quotation marks, and labels the source, he is engaging in allusive quotation but is approaching the border line—even by nineteenth-century standards—between quotation and fresh composition. He apparently crosses that line in the passage that purports to be from Antonio de Ulloa, describing the breath of the whale "attended with such an insupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain"; these words seem in fact to be Melville's own elaboration of the three-word phrase "an insupportable smell," which refers in Ulloa to a fish called "cope." The next step is to create an entirely new passage and provide it with a fictitious source: the extract following the one from John Ramsay McCulloch is labeled " From 'Something' unpublished " and is presumably Melville's own extension of a point raised by the McCulloch quotation, for it is clearly designed to follow McCulloch's statement but does not occur there in the original. Melville does not engage in this practice often, but the presence of one or two examples further strengthens the view of the "Extracts" section as a creative work and not a mere anthology. Suggesting that something created on the spot has an independent existence outside the work tends to break down any rigid boundary between what is external and what is internal, and references to "real" sources can sometimes partake more of the internal world of the work than of external reality. One extract, which describes some white crew members returning from the pursuit of a whale to find "their ship in bloody possession of the savages enrolled among the crew," is credited to a " Newspaper Account of the Taking and Retaking of the Whale-ship Hobomack ." In fact, however, no such mutiny took place on board the Falmouth ship Hobomok . Melville's recollection of stories he must have heard probably resulted in the mixing together of details of two different events: the 1835 fight between some Namorik Islanders and the crew of the Falmouth ship Awashonks , and the 1842 mutiny by some Kings-mill Islanders on board the Fairhaven ship Sharon . The details of the Sharon mutiny fit more closely with those described in the extract; but one of the officers of the Awashonks in 1835 was captain of the Hobomok in 1841, when Melville's ship encountered it, and Melville may therefore have been thinking partly of his account. After investigating this tangle, Wilson Heflin decided that this extract must be "a piece of Melville's invention." 18 If so, no substantive emendation would be appropriate. To replace " Hobomack " with " Awashonks " or " Sharon " (which one?) would probably not restore what Melville intended to write; and, while either one would fit the facts somewhat better, there is no reason why Melville should be required to follow facts here. Whether or not the spelling of the ship should be corrected to " Hobomok " is a separate question. Because Melville did know of the actual Hobomok and because "o" and "a" are sometimes difficult to distinguish in his handwriting, it may be that he wrote "Hobomock" rather than "Hobomack," and one could defend an emendation to " Hobomock " (as a permissible variant of the correct spelling) or possibly to " Hobomok ." Recognizing that what the extract describes never took place aboard the real Hobomok does not prevent one from correcting the spelling of the ship's name on the assumption that the actual ship Hobomok is being referred to in the citation—for the likelihood is that Melville was thinking of the real ship but confusing what happened on it. 19 The supposed quotation is thus inspired by real events and refers to a real ship; but the " Newspaper Account ," and the Hobomok mutiny it reports, exist only within Melville's "Extracts." Discussion of " Hobomack ," which occurs in a citation rather than an extract, calls attention to the fact that problems of external reference are just as likely to occur in the citations. Some of the questions they raise are the same as those connected with quotations in general. Thus the citations of Darwin's " Voyage of a Naturalist " and Lay and Hussey's " Narrative of the Globe Mutiny " should not be considered errors simply because these are not the actual titles of the two books; the works alluded to are easily identifiable from such references, which are examples of the widespread nineteenth-century custom of allusive citation. 20 And when Robert P. Gillies's Tales of a Voyager to the Arctic Ocean (1826) is reported as " Tales of a Whale Voyager to the Arctic Ocean ," one knows that the inaccurate citation, with " Whale " inserted, is intended by Melville. Or when " Most Extraordinary and Distressing " is omitted and " Spermaceti-Whale " becomes " Sperm Whale " in the long title of Owen Chase's Narrative (1821), one can allow the altered wording to stand on the grounds that it seems more likely to have resulted from intentional alteration than inadvertent slip. But another long title, for Henry T. Cheever's The Whale and His Captors (1849), is transcribed so precisely as to suggest that exact quotation is intended, and the one slight omission —an "as" introducing the last phrase—should therefore probably be rectified. Citation of an altogether wrong title raises a more interesting issue. The extract from James Montgomery is credited to " World before the Flood " but actually comes from his "The Pelican Island"; the error is one that Melville takes from a secondary source, because Cheever's book quotes the same lines from Montgomery and provides the same citation. The question, raised earlier, whether an editor is called upon to correct the errors of a secondary source, requires further thought in a case of this kind. Misquotations in the text derived from a secondary source—and there are two in the Montgomery passage deriving from Cheever—generally do not require emendation because they constitute part of the passages as the quoter knew them. 21 But allowing an erroneous citation of this sort to stand is a different matter. It is true that Melville was equally trusting of Cheever here and accepted the title as " World before the Flood "; but surely his intention in writing it down, judging from his practice in the "Extracts" as a whole, was simply to provide a factual reference. Of course, one can also argue, as with the misquotations in the text, that he may have responded to the wording of the title he found in his source and that the title should similarly not be corrected. Another extract (although the situation is not quite parallel) may provide some relevant evidence: " Pilgrim's Progress " is corrected in the first English edition to " Holy War ," a correction that was evidently among those made by Melville on the proofs sent abroad and one that reflects a concern for correct citations. In any case, the decision on the Montgomery citation is a difficult one. Editors could argue either way; but there would seem to be enough difference in function and effect between a citation of source and a quotation to justify differing treatments, and a case can be made for correcting the Montgomery reference. (Even if no emendation is made, a note should of course call attention to the correct title and explain Melville's source of the incorrect one.) Other corrections of factual errors in citations are less debatable: the man who wrote on the Bermudas in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1668 was named Stafford, not "Strafford," and the date of Jefferson's " Whale Memorial to the French minister " was 1788, not "1778." 22 There is no pattern in the "Extracts" suggesting the deliberate alteration of facts of this kind: although the "Extracts" section can be called an imaginative work, it maintains a firm link with external reality. Another, much shorter, preliminary section precedes the "Extracts" at the front of Moby-Dick , and it raises similar problems because it, too, is made up of material having an existence outside the work and is assigned a fictional compiler, a "Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School." Called "Etymology," this section consists of three quotations, followed by a list of the words for "whale" in thirteen languages. Such a list would appear to be purely a factual matter, but the critical editor, interested in Melville's intention, will find that it raises some intricate questions. One of them can serve as a kind of conspectus of the considerations involved in dealing with external fact in a literary work. Just before the English word "WHALE" in the list appears the entry for the Icelandic, and the word given in the original edition is "WHALE," identical with the English. Because this is not the Icelandic for "whale" and because it seems unlikely that Melville would have wished to have two identical words in his short list (one of the purposes of which appears to be to display a variety of words) 23 it would at first seem reasonable to regard the Icelandic "WHALE" as a scribal or compositorial error (influenced by the word in the next line), or as an authorial slip. But the situation is not that simple: Melville himself may very well have intended to write the word "whale," because in Uno von Troil's Letters on Iceland (1780), in the paragraph just preceding the one from which Melville took one of his extracts, there occurs the expression " illwhale (bad whales)," in which the first word is offered as the Icelandic and the parenthesis as the English translation. From this Melville may have concluded that if he dropped the "ill" from "illwhale" he would be left with the Icelandic for "whale." If so, he was doubly wrong: in the first place, "illwhale" is not an Icelandic word, and the second edition of Troil (1780) corrects it to " Illhwele "; in the second place, removing the "Ill," even from this corrected form, does not produce the word for "whale." What is the editor to do? If Melville is misled by an error in a source and bases a discussion on the error, nothing can be done; but here there is no discussion, only a simple listing in which Melville apparently intended to give the correct word. But if one applies to Troil's corrected text the operation Melville seemingly performed on the first text, one still has an incorrect word; the editor would be in the position of making an emendation no more correct than the original reading. If one decides to correct the text, then, one must bypass Melville's presumed source entirely and insert the modern Icelandic word "hvalur." 24 One could reasonably defend this action by arguing—as with certain facts in the citations of sources for the extracts—that Melville's intention, evident in the text, to provide correct facts justifies the editor's going beyond Melville's knowledge to make the correction, so long as the error does not achieve a possible significance of its own within the text. On the other hand, one could argue against the emendation by saying that, if Melville did indeed, on the basis of consulting an outside source, regard "whale" as the correct Icelandic word, "whale" is thus his intended form and should remain. But Melville's use of Troil's erroneous " illwhale ," while highly likely, is after all conjectural and should not be elevated to the status of fact. One cannot dismiss entirely the possibility that first suggested itself: "whale" as a scribal or compositorial error for the correct word (presumably "hvalur") in Melville's manuscript, or even Melville's own lapse (with "hvalur" as what he meant to write). Even if one finally emends on this basis, the speculation about Melville's possible use of Troil is not wasted effort, for in suggesting one explanation for the appearance of "WHALE" in the text it focuses attention on a crucial issue: the degree to which Melville wished to respect external fact in this instance. Besides, the critical editor cannot be in a position to make informed judgments at such points without investigating all available leads to external sources. This illustration draws together a remarkable number of basic editorial questions and shows how references to external fact can provide peculiarly effective test cases for revealing how thoroughly an editorial approach has been thought through.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II If the "Extracts" and the "Etymology" in Moby-Dick are unusual in providing such a concentrated array of editorial questions, the questions themselves are not at all extraordinary but are in fact the characteristic ones that arise whenever external references are involved. Sampling the thinking that goes into answering those questions in this particular instance should serve as preparation for considering the general problem in a larger framework. To begin with, determining what is "external" to a piece of writing—and what in it should therefore be expected to correspond with a standard outside itself—is a difficult task of definition. As soon as one starts to check quotations, titles of books, dates, and names of persons and places against external sources, one begins to ask how these elements differ from the spellings of all the ordinary words of the text and whether there is actually anything in the text that does not have to be measured against an external standard. On one level, of course, any communication has to be regarded as made up largely of external elements: a writer or speaker would not be able to communicate without utilizing a set of conventional symbols that are interpreted in the same way by other persons. The words and grammar of a language are external in this sense, for writers must in some degree conform to linguistic conventions that are a social product and are not their own personal inventions. Editors are concerned with such matters, and in attempting to establish unmodernized texts they take pains to see that the spelling and punctuation, for instance, conform to the standards of the writer's time or fall within the range of possibilities conventionally tolerated at that time. But editors will feel that they are not quite doing the same thing when they "correct" a date or a quotation or the spelling of an historical figure's name; they will feel, in other words, that specific historical facts constitute a different category from the medium—words and grammar—employed for communication and are external to the communication in a different sense. In thinking about these matters, Ferdinand de Saussure's seminal distinction between langue and parole is basic, for it separates language, with its infinite possibilities for expression, from each particular act of speaking—it separates "what is social from what is individual." Langue is "a product that is passively assimilated by the individual," whereas parole , the individual act of execution, is "wilful and intellectual" and is "never carried out by the collectivity." 25 This distinction can, by extension, help to explain the editor's role. Editors, of course, deal with individual acts of expression, and their task, in reconstructing an author's intention, is to determine just what in the expression, as it has come down to them, is "wilful"; they constantly examine the characteristics of the preserved parole in the light of the langue , as it were. When a word is not spelled conventionally or a singular verb follows a plural subject, are these "wilful" deviations by the author or are they simply errors of transmission (including authorial slips) at points where the author was passively following (or intending to follow) the conventions of the language? An author may, for the purposes of the immediate act of expression, decide to violate the rules of the language, and that violation can become an effective part of the communication; but if such violation proceeds too far it can prevent communication and turn the utterance into a purely private one. 26 The act of critical editing is a constant weighing of the extent to which a work can be autonomous. At each point of possible deviation from the norm, the editor is called upon to adjudicate the claims of idiosyncrasy against those of convention. In most instances, all there is to go on is the intention manifested in the work itself; the editor's decisions are based on an understanding of the internal workings of a particular act of expression. 27 For this reason one can think of these matters as internal, even though in handling them one must naturally refer to the external conventions of the medium. The difference at points where quotations, dates, and the like occur is that in these instances there is something external to be taken into account in addition to the potentialities of the language itself. These parts of the expression make external reference in a way that the rest of the words do not; they are second-hand elements, so to speak, because they are taken over from a previous parole , a previous specific use. The situation is most obvious in the case of quotations: words quoted (or even paraphrased) from a particular passage by another writer have lying behind them, when placed in a new context, an external standard of reference besides that of the words and grammar involved—namely, the specific configuration of words and syntax that constituted the other writer's communication. This additional standard poses for editors an additional problem: at such points they have to consider not only words, punctuation, and grammar—as they would anywhere—but also what relation the passage is meant to bear to the original (or some other earlier) occurrence of the same passage. Determining what makes it in fact the "same" passage (when the two are not identical) is analogous to deciding when authors' revisions of their own works produce new works and when they do not. Indeed, authors returning to work they have previously written stand in much the same relationship to it as they would to the work of other authors. The central question faced by editors whenever they are confronted with a piece of writing that contains within it fragments from earlier pieces of writing is the one formulated by E. D. Hirsch, Jr., in his summary of Saussure: "should we assume that sentences from varied provenances retain their original meanings or that these heterogeneous elements have become integral components of a new total meaning?" Put another way, "should we consider the text to represent a compilation of divers paroles or a new unitary parole 'respoken' by the new author or editor?" Hirsch replies that "there can be no definitive answer to the question, except in relation to a specific scholarly or aesthetic purpose." 28 In scholarly editing, the editor aims to conform to the desires of the author and must therefore attempt to understand the author's aesthetic purpose in quoting. There may be times when an author intends to be factually accurate in making a quotation and other times (even within the same work) when the author is less concerned with the quotation as a quotation than with making it a supporting element in the new context. The editor of a critical text cannot escape the responsibility of judging which is the case at any given point. If quotations are perhaps the most immediately obvious examples of second-hand, or repeated, paroles , they are by no means the only elements of a discourse that can be so classified. References to actual geographical locations, specific historical figures, dates of real events, and so on are also instances where words are taken over from a prior use. Ordinary concrete nouns, like "chair" and "table," refer to any member of a given class and not to individual objects until employed by a writer or speaker to do so; spelling or pronouncing "chair" correctly is a function of the conventions of the language, not of the particular use in referring to one specific actual or imagined chair. The same can frequently be said of words like "Jefferson" and "1788": a writer can create an Oliver Jefferson, spell his name "Jeffarson," and have him participate in a fictitious battle at a fictitious location in 1788. To do this is to pin "Jefferson" (as well as "1788") down to one among the infinite possibilities of denotation it contains. But if the context shows that the reference is to Thomas Jefferson's whale memorial of 1788, the writer is using a "Jefferson" and a "1788" for which precise denotations have already been established. If indeed the reference is to the real Thomas Jefferson and to the whale memorial actually issued in 1788—and that is a crucial editorial question—the writer is not assigning the denotations to the words but is in effect quoting an earlier specific assignment, one that many readers may already be familiar with and will recognize without explanation. Although it is not customary in written material to place quotation marks around a proper name whenever a previous use of the name is meant, the similarity between such references and quoted passages of writing is obvious. In either case the writer is employing words over which there is an external control beyond the ordinary conventions of the language. These words, then, are the ones that can be said to involve "external fact" and to add thereby an additional dimension to the editorial problem. That dimension can be illustrated by the treatment of the spelling of proper names as well as by the handling of quotations. When the editors of the Centenary Edition of Hawthorne emend a governor's name from "Burnett" to "Burnet" and another one from "Phipps" to "Phips" in "The Prophetic Pictures," "Smollet" to "Smollett" in "Old News," and "Glumdalea" to "Glumdalca" in Fanshawe , 29 they are acting in each case on the judgment that the reference is to a figure (whether real or fictitious) with an existence independent of Hawthorne's work and that the name therefore has an externally verifiable spelling. Whereas the "correct" spelling of ordinary words is determined by the usage of the people who employ those words and continually evolves along with the language, the spelling of an individual's name, it would seem, is fixed: 30 departures from that spelling, no matter how common, are errors. The matter cannot simply be left there, however. To do so would be analogous to saying that quoted passages must conform to the original and that all misquotations are errors requiring emendation. Two factors complicate decisions about emending personal names. One is the attitude toward spelling during the lifetimes of the individuals concerned and their own attitudes toward the spellings of their names; many Elizabethans, for instance, spelled their own names in different ways—in keeping with the approach to spelling in general at the time—and as a result more than one "correct" spelling can exist, just as more than one authorized form of a quotation may be possible, at points where its author has revised it. Even in periods when spellings in general are less flexible, it is not unknown for certain people to spell their names differently at different times in their lives, and various traditions of using one or another of such "correct" forms to refer to these people may grow up, just as one of the authorized versions of a passage may be more widely cited than the others at certain periods. There may be some range of possibilities, in other words, all of which are "correct." A second factor influencing editorial decisions is the possibility of legitimate motives for utilizing "unauthorized" spellings. A spelling that is in fact incorrect may become part of an established literary tradition, and writers using such a spelling are merely drawing on that tradition; or, alternatively, writers may alter a spelling on their own for its effect in the context where they are using it. The former possibility is not the same as saying—as one can with ordinary words—that the correct spelling changes with time, for the ways in which people spell their own names are historical facts that cannot be altered, even though a writer may choose to make reference to a tradition of spelling certain names differently. The editor who allows such spellings to stand has gone through a process of finding defensible support for historical errors—a process unnecessary in the case of ordinary words whose conventional spellings at the time a writer used them were no longer what they had been at an earlier time. When Melville refers in the "Etymology" section to "Hackluyt," 31 one can argue that the spelling is not simply an error for "Hakluyt," both on the grounds that greater latitude was permitted in spellings in Hakluyt's time and on the grounds that Melville was drawing on (or assumed he was drawing on) an established tradition represented by the occurrence of "Hackluyt" in Charles Richardson's Dictionary , his source at this point. But when George Bennet's name appears as "Bennett" at the end of the sixty-fifth extract, the likelihood that the spelling is a mere slip outweighs other possibilities, for the man is a nineteenth-century figure, there is no established tradition of referring to him as "Bennett," and there seems no plausible reason for Melville to have introduced such a change intentionally; the spelling should therefore be corrected. And Melville's repeated spelling of Owen Chase's name as "Chace" (in the "Extracts," in Chapter 45, and in other places outside of Moby-Dick ) is also an error, no matter how consistently Melville used it, for he had Chase's 1821 book in front of him, he was clearly referring to that particular writer, and there is no other acceptable spelling for that writer's name. The same line of reasoning applies to geographical names as well as personal names, although the continuing existence of places means that traditions of "unofficial" spellings of place names may be stronger than in the case of personal names. When "Nuremburgh" turns up in Hawthorne's "Ethan Brand," the Centenary editors correct it, as an out-right error, to "Nuremberg." 32 But when "Heidelburgh" appears consistently in Moby-Dick (Chapter 77), one can argue that what is actually an incorrect spelling conveys for Melville a certain flavor and that in any case the presence of this spelling in one of Melville's important source books (John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca ) suggests that Melville was aligning himself with whatever tradition that book represents in this matter. "Heidelburgh" remains an erroneous spelling, but the editor may decide, with good reason, that it is not an erroneous reading in this particular text. These arguments, of course, are based on the prior assumption that the references are to the "real" Hakluyt, Bennet, Chase, Nuremberg, and Heidelberg and not to invented people and places with similar names. But the question must always be considered, for a change of spelling in a proper name can be said to produce a new name, not just a different form of the old one, 33 in the same way that an altered quotation can be regarded as a different piece of writing. Therefore, in dealing with proper names that are identical with, or closely resemble, those of real people and places, editors must first determine from the context whether the reference is indeed to those people and places and then decide, again from the context, the extent to which a departure from the external facts can be justified as a part of the writer's active intention—an intention either to draw on a tradition or to introduce something new. The issues raised by the spelling of the names of real people and places do resemble in some respects those associated with any questions of spelling. But the crucial difference is the additional level of external reference involved in employing words whose individualized denotations have been established outside the context in which those words are now placed. It is true that only through the context can one finally decide which words these are; but once they are located, they fall into a different class from the other words by virtue of their reference to external facts. In thinking about them, editors need to go beyond the preparation they bring to other words, for they need to be acquainted with the forms these words have taken in their historical association with particular people and places. Like quotations, proper names force editors to ask themselves what status a "fact" has when it is moved from one context to another. The issues involved show themselves clearly when a fact is moved into a work of fiction. Within a fictional world, facts can be altered in any way the author sees fit; yet to the extent that the author wishes a fact to be recognized it retains some connection with the outside world. These proportions—and their implications, both in the immediate passage and in the novel or story as a whole—are what the editor has to think about in order to decide whether or not to correct an error of external fact. One of the most pervasive questions has to do with setting. If a novelist places the action in real locations at a particular time, how much accuracy is intended in the details referring to that setting? Or, put another way, if certain datable events are employed, do all the other details have to be consistent with the date thus suggested? In Howells's A Hazard of New Fortunes an adverbial variant in one sentence alters the time-setting of the entire novel. The Harper's Weekly text reads, in a reference to Washington Square, "The primo tenore statue of Garibaldi had not yet taken possession of the place"; in the other texts "not yet" is replaced with "already," shifting the action to some time between the erection of that statue in 1888 and the completion of the novel in 1889. The editors of the Indiana Howells, recognizing that this variant involves "a question of the historical perspective of the novel," argue for the "already" reading on the grounds that Howells finished the novel in 1889 and that his "choice of detail" suggests a fictional setting at the same time. 34 There is at least one detail, however, pointing to an earlier date: Lindau refers to his wife's death "Right after I got home from the war—tventy years ago," placing the action in the middle 1880s. 35 If one adopts the "already" reading as Howells's final intention, the question is whether this discrepancy makes any difference. It is not, after all, an internal discrepancy, for neither the date of the end of the Civil War nor that of the erection of the Garibaldi statue is given in the novel, and there is no reason why, for fictional purposes, the two sentences need to be regarded as inconsistent. On the other hand, these references are in fact externally verifiable, and Howells's intentions as to factual accuracy can only be gauged by his methods as revealed in the text itself. Since this novel is essentially "realistic," one could argue that inconsistencies involving external fact do matter and that the two sentences should be brought into alignment. Whether the authority attaching to the "already" reading carries enough weight to require the editor to add a word altering Lindau's statement or whether the earlier "not yet" reading (presumably authorial at least, even if superseded) is preferable so as to obviate further editorial intrusion is a delicate editorial question. Even if one believes that the "already" must be adopted as Howells's intention and that consistency in external fact is also intended, one may feel that the addition of even a single word to the other sentence goes beyond an editor's prerogative and that the inconsistency must stand, even though contrary to the spirit of the work. Certainly a great amount of rewriting cannot be undertaken, but deciding whether the insertion of a single word (what word? "over" or "about" before "tventy"?) 36 is excessive constitutes another question of editorial judgment. The crucial issue for present purposes is not how the inconsistency is rectified but the considerations involved in deciding whether it can be and needs to be rectified—whether, first of all, the editor can reasonably do anything about it and then, if so, whether it is actually an inconsistency in the fictional world. 37 More often a factual problem in a novel involves only a local context and does not affect the entire time-scheme or setting of the work. But even so, sensitivity to the nature of the whole, as well as to the local context, is necessary for deciding when factual accuracy is in order. Frequently an historical figure becomes a character in a novel and engages at times in events that actually took place and at other times in events that are fictitious; in assessing any particular "factual" error, therefore, the editor must consider both the historicity of the immediate context and the methods of weaving together fact and fiction used throughout the book. Even in a roman à clef , where the historical figures are given new names, the relation of the depicted characteristics and events to actual ones (or traditional ideas of the "actual" ones) cannot be ignored, for an editor may be able to decide among variants or detect corrupt readings by knowing those external facts. The elusive nature of fact in fiction 38 is a fascinating subject for speculation and has been much written about, particularly by literary critics and biographers seeking correlations between authors' lives and their works; the subject also turns up in the popular press, discussions in recent years having been stimulated by Truman Capote's concept of the "nonfiction novel" and by television dramatizations based loosely on real events. These commentaries—some of which are concerned with the ethics of placing real people in compromising situations they are not known to have found themselves in 39 — generally deal with different questions from those the editor must think about. The editor's interest is not basically in whether a real person has been slandered by a fictional representation or whether a real event has been misrepresented but whether the details present in the text are those that the writer intended to be there. In order to be in a position to make an informed judgment on that matter, however, the editor has to learn, as far as possible, what the external facts are and to analyze—like the critic and biographer that the editor must in part be—the nature of the transmutation of those facts into fiction. The border lines between external fact and fictional fact are constantly shifting, as Melville demonstrates when in Chapter 72 of Moby-Dick , after describing the "monkey-rope" tying together the harpooneer (on the whale's slippery back) and the bowsman (on deck), he appends a footnote beginning, "The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb." A fictional fact—a usage invented by a fictional character on a fictional ship—is here thrust out into the real world as the Pequod is compared with all other ships; or, rather, the real world is pulled into the novel, for the external truthfulness of the statement about all ships is irrelevant to the fictional world, in which it becomes a fact that the Pequod differs from all other ships in its use of the monkeyrope. Yet external facts may have to be called on when there is an internal discrepancy. In the American first edition of Moby-Dick , a passage discussing some famous whales (Chapter 45) refers to "Timor Tom" and "New Zealand Jack," but the next paragraph cites "New Zealand Tom"; in the English edition the discrepancy was evidently noted, for "Tom" in the third instance is changed to "Jack," thus producing consistency. It is clear that the American text must be emended, but the change selected in the English edition is not the only one that would make the names consistent, and the editor must decide which way to do it. Knowing that Melville's source, Thomas Beale's The Natural History of the Sperm Whale , gives the names as "Timor Jack" and "New Zealand Tom" should settle the matter. Melville was of course free to alter these names if he wished; but since the editor has to make some emendation and since there is no evidence in this passage to suggest that Melville wanted to change the names, the obvious course is to emend them in conformity with the external source. At another point (Chapter 99) Flask figures that a doubloon worth sixteen dollars will buy him 960 two-cent cigars. At first this discrepancy seems purely an internal one, a matter of incorrect arithmetic. But of course the idea that it is a discrepancy rests on the assumption that American dollars of one hundred cents are meant or that no bulk rate was customary for two-cent cigars. If one argued that the "dollars" were Spanish-American dollars, freely circulating among American seamen as the equivalent of a British crown or $1.20, the discrepancy would vanish, as it would if one were to establish that two-cent cigars sold for 20&amp;c.nt; a dozen. External facts are relevant, in other words, to determining whether or not Melville could have intended the figures in the printed text. Many references to external facts in novels do not involve such internal discrepancies (or seeming ones) that call attention to themselves but rather are discrepant only when compared with an outside source. Moby-Dick , again, can conveniently illustrate how the treatment of these "errors" must vary with the immediate context. At one point (Chapter 101) the narrator presents some statistics about the stocks of food on a whaling ship, statistics said to be taken from a book called "Dan Coopman." A check of Melville's source for this passage, William Scoresby's An Account of the Arctic Regions (1820), shows that a double "error" is present: the book, according to Scoresby, is "Den Koopman," and he actually cites the statistics from a different work. But the playful nature of Melville's passage makes any "correction" out of the question. First of all, he takes "Dan Coopman" to be "the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper." This use of the name would in itself prevent an editor from altering the spelling or substituting another name. In addition, the spirit of the passage is suggested by the reference to "Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for translation." Within such a context the misattribution of the statistics is of no moment, for Melville is not expecting the reader to think of "Dan Coopman" as any more or less real than "Dr. Snodhead." An earlier passage, near the reference to "New Zealand Tom" (Chapter 45), offers a contrast. There the captains who insistently search for particular celebrated whales are said to have "heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip." In fact it was Captain Benjamin Church who pursued Annawon in Rhode Island in 1676; Colonel William Butler's expedition was against the Indian leader Brant in upstate New York in 1778. The sentence could be made factually correct by substituting "Church" for "Butler," and an editor could persuasively argue in favor of this emendation: the reference seems to be a simple factual allusion, in a context stressing facts, and there seems to be no literary reason for Melville's wishing to alter the name. "Butler" is probably a mere slip (since Melville knew the story of Brant also) for the intended word "Church"; and because no further discussion in the text depends on the word "Butler" (that is, the error is confined to this one clause), it is feasible for an editor to make the change. Moby-Dick may be more extreme than many works of fiction in its oscillation between the imaginative and the factual, but it illustrates a point applicable to all fiction: that a fictional framework does not preclude the existence within it of passages (of whatever length, whether a chapter or only part of a sentence) that aim to be factually accurate. An editor, therefore, can justifiably make factual corrections in a work of fiction; deciding when they are justified entails literary sensitivity and is one of the responsibilities of the critical editor. The editing of another of Melville's works has occasioned some debate over this principle, and the argument put forth can be instructive. Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., in preparing their reading text (1962) of Billy Budd, Sailor , follow the reasoning just outlined and correct errors of fact when in their judgment the context shows that Melville was trying to be factually accurate. 40 Thus when Melville refers to the execution of "a midshipman and two petty officers" aboard the actual ship Somers , Hayford and Sealts alter "petty officers" to "sailors," since only one was in fact a petty officer. Peter Shaw has attacked this decision and, with a notable lack of restraint, calls it "Possibly the most stunning liberty with an author's text in the twentieth century." 41 Shaw's objection is based on the argument that errors are revealing. "Freud's doctrine in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life ," he says, "offers the definitive argument against unconsidered editorial corrections." Naturally editorial emendations should never be "unconsidered," but he seems to be saying that corrections of factual error should probably never be undertaken in the first place: "Freud's book made it a matter of common sense that an error usually reveals more than does a controlled statement of intention." Shaw unnecessarily confuses the issue here, for statements of intention are beside the point: obviously a statement of intention does not necessarily match the actual realized intention, and editors are not concerned with statements of intention but authors' intentions as manifested in their works. At any rate Shaw is correct to observe that errors can be revealing, and his application of the point here is to say that, because Melville's cousin had been a first lieutenant on the Somers , "Any unconscious exaggeration by Melville of the rank of those executed has possible significance for the astute reader." The question he does not go on to address, however, is why this kind of significance is appropriate to be preserved in the critical text of a literary work like Billy Budd (that the original reading should be preserved in the notes goes without saying). What Shaw fails to take into account in his discussion is the difference between working papers or private documents and finished literary products intended for an audience. When editors prepare private papers for publication, there is no doubt that they should not smooth out the text by eliminating factual errors, misspellings, deleted phrases, and the like. 42 All these features are part of the essential nature of such documents, and their psychological significance is one of the reasons for the importance of the documents. When Sir Walter Scott in his journal refers to an acquaintance whose real name was Durham Calderwood as "Calderwood Durham" or speaks of a marriage that actually took place in 1825 as occurring "in the beginning of 1826," these slips are integral parts of the text of the document, and one would be losing part of what the document has to offer if they were corrected; W. E. K. Anderson is right to leave them in the text in his Clarendon edition and merely to point out the errors in footnotes. 43 There is no question, in other words, that Shaw's point is correct in regard to the texts of private documents. Literary works and other works intended for publication, however, open up additional possibilities. They, too, can be treated as documents, and editors can prepare literatim transcriptions of any extant manuscripts, or facsimiles of particular copies of printed editions. Such work is valuable in making important evidence more widely available. But works intended for publication also demand to be edited in another way, which results in texts incorporating their authors' final intentions about what was to be placed before the public. Such works—by virtue of the fact they are intended for publication—have a public as well as a private aspect. When one is concerned to retain in the edited text all the readings of a particular document, one is focusing on a single stage in the growth of the work. The document is of historical significance because it preserves that stage; but usually no single extant document preserves a text that is free of error, in the sense that it contains all the readings finally intended by the author. 44 Therefore it is important, in approaching these intellectual products as works and not simply as specific documents , that editors use their informed judgment to produce eclectic texts, drawing critically on the available evidence and on their own sense of what constitutes an error in a given text. The evidence present in the extant documents can (and should) be recorded as notes to the critical text, but the text itself does not attempt to reproduce exactly any particular document. In the case of Billy Budd , the preserved papers are clearly a private document, a working draft; but they contain a work of fiction, a work of the kind normally intended for a public audience, and not a diary or notebook entries. Recognizing this dual interest in the papers, Hayford and Sealts have prepared two edited texts. One of them, a "genetic" text, attempts to provide an accurate transcription of the textual features of the document, showing in the process the order of Melville's deletions, insertions, and alterations; the other, a "reading" text, attempts to offer a critical text representing Melville's intentions for the work as discernible from the document. The former aims to do justice to the manuscript as a document of Melville's biography and of American literary history; the latter aims to do justice to its text as a work of fiction. In the former, Melville's phrase "a midshipman and two petty officers" naturally appears, for there is no question here of emending what Melville actually put on paper, even if it was not what he intended to write. But in the latter, critical judgment must be employed to decide whether that factual error is one that Melville intended to make for the purposes of his fiction; Hayford and Sealts conclude that it is not, and they correct it. To believe that in doing so they have exercised an unwarranted liberty is to fail to understand the nature and the value of critical editing. Obviously another critic may disagree with them and argue that there are reasons for thinking that Melville particularly wished to say "petty officers" here; the issue involves literary judgment, and differences of opinion about it are bound to exist. But criticizing Hayford and Sealts's decision on this basis is not to object to the process of emending a text in conformity with the editor's view of the author's intention. Shaw's criticism, on the other hand, in effect questions the validity of critical editing: Shaw disapproves of the Hayford-Sealts emendation because the original reading may provide psychological insight into Melville's motivation, and he is thus objecting to a critical text for not being a transcription. The confusion in his thinking is suggested by the two possible interpretations that he offers of "Any unconscious exaggeration by Melville of the rank of those executed": Melville may have exaggerated "to increase the importance of the parallel with the Somers " or "out of a vaguely shared guilt over his cousin's complicity in the matter." The first, which would not have been unconscious, has to do with the literary effect of the comparison and could presumably be a reason for retaining the original reading in a critical text; the second, insofar as it is conceivable, is a reason for being interested in the error but not a reason for leaving it in the critical text of a literary work. 45 When Shaw concludes that the Hayford-Sealts emendation is "as significant as a nineteenth-century editor's excision of an entire paragraph of sexually explicit or politically dangerous material," he reveals his failure to understand that editorial alteration of a text can ever be anything other than a kind of censorship, something standing in the way of the author's expression rather than promoting it. This episode illustrates in dramatic fashion how the discussion of a factual error in a work of fiction demands a clear understanding of the different editorial approaches that can productively be employed. The essential prerequisite to clear thinking on the matter is recognizing the difference between a transcription, in which the editor must faithfully reproduce the errors of a particular document, and a critical text, in which the editor is not bound to retain a factual error simply because it is present in an authoritative document. A critical editor may finally decide to retain such an error on critical grounds but not because the error is a revealing Freudian slip, suggestive of the author's state of mind at the time of the preparation of a given document. The two approaches are distinct, and neither can be carried out competently if considerations applicable to one are allowed to intrude into the other. Errors of external fact often seem to provide the test cases for determining how well an editor has learned that lesson. 46 If factual errors in fiction need not always be corrected in a critical text, one might at first assume that the situation would be different with "nonfiction" writing—any writing that is expository in nature, attempting to deal with the real world directly, not through the creation of an imagined world. Surely, one might think, factual errors and misquotations cannot be a legitimate part of the intended texts of such works. Everyone senses the distinction that René Wellek speaks of when he says, "There is a central and important difference between a statement, even in a historical novel or a novel by Balzac which seems to convey 'information' about actual happenings, and the same information appearing in a book of history or sociology." 47 The difference is undeniable, and yet there seem to be intermediate shadings. One reads a "book of history" like Gibbon or Macaulay as a work of literary creativity, and not merely because it is from the past and limited in its information by what was known at the time. Or one reads an essay of sociological or philosophical analysis for its mastery of exposition, recognizing that some of its points may be half-truths or distortions employed to advance a particular argument. Of course, the truth or falsity of the information conveyed does not alter the fact that in such works the author is speaking directly to the reader, not through a fictional persona or a created world. Any author, whether producing novels and poems or writing essays, may undertake to alter facts for the purposes of the work, and what we think of as "creative literature" does not exclude so-called "nonfiction." 48 Many attempts have been made to distinguish writing that is "literature" from writing that is not, 49 but no satisfactory dividing line has ever been established. The implication of all this for the editor of a critical text is to suggest that a blanket rule regarding the correction of factual errors in nonfiction would be just as shortsighted as such a rule for more obviously "literary" works. Since deciding whether a given work can be regarded as "literature" is itself an act of critical judgment, no such classification can serve to delimit for the editor certain writing to be treated in a different way from other writing. Instead, the critical editor must approach so-called "nonfiction" in the same way as fiction: the author is just as capable of altering facts intentionally, just as likely to develop a point based on an error, and just as much bound by the customs of the time; and the editor therefore has the same responsibility to assess each factual error in the light of the evidence offered by its context. Perhaps even more than with fiction, a common situation in nonfiction is the occurrence of quotations from other works. Several philosophers have now been accorded careful critical editions, and the problem of quotations has been confronted in them. In the first volume (1969) of Jo Ann Boydston's edition of The Early Works of John Dewey, Fredson Bowers contributes a statement of textual policy that records a central point: "In Dewey's texts," he says, "all quotations have been retained just as he wrote them even though not always strictly accurate, since that was the form on which he was founding his ideas" (p. xvii). A basic reason for allowing inaccurate quotations to stand, in fiction as well as nonfiction, is that the quotations in that form may have ramifications that are unemendable—they may be the subject of a discussion in the text or may have influenced the author's thinking. Retaining Dewey's quotations "just as he wrote them," however, raises another problem, for it is conceivable that what he wrote at times contained mere slips and did not always reflect what he intended to write (whether or not what he intended to write was accurate), and it is also possible that some errors in quotations in printed texts or in nonauthorial manuscripts or typescripts are slips by people other than Dewey. Bowers does not go into this question because no emendations in quotations are in fact made in this volume; but the relevance of the issue is clearly recognized by Jo Ann Boydston, who, in her introduction to the appendix that prints the correct wording of the inaccurate quotations, 50 says, "It should be noted that specific changes, both in substantives and in accidentals, may have been instituted in the transmission rather than by Dewey himself. The variable form of quoting does suggest that Dewey, like many scholars of the period, was not overly concerned about precision in accidentals, but many of the changes in cited materials may well have arisen in the printing process" (p. lxxxix). Recognition of that fact underscores the necessity for a critical approach to each quotation, an attempt to judge on the basis of the available evidence—including the editor's understanding of the author's methods in general and aims in the particular passage—just which inaccuracies of quotation were probably slips. It is also worth observing that Boydston's statement calls attention to the importance of knowing contemporary standards: in an unmodernized edition it would clearly be wrong to hold Dewey to stricter standards of accuracy in quotation than were customary among his colleagues. In later volumes of the Dewey edition some emendations in quotations are made, and the critical approach implicit in Boydston's comments in the first volume is more explicitly remarked upon. Bowers adds to his essay the point that sometimes "special circumstances in a specific text require the correction of quotations within the text itself" (IV, xlix; V, cxxviii); and Boydston notes that some house-styling of Dewey's periodical pieces encompassed the quotations as well, giving the editor a reason for restoring certain punctuation to those quotations (V, clxxvi). Sometimes an internal contradiction calls attention to what was intended in the quotation: Dewey quotes a sentence from Paul Bourget, but the text omits a clause on Stendhal, leaving four writers mentioned; because Dewey refers to the "five" writers in the quotation, it is clear that he intended for that clause to be present, and it is of course restored (III, 37). In other cases, the internal contradiction may be less mechanical but no less forceful: when a quotation from Alexander Bain reads, "a mental association is rapidly formed between his [the child's] obedience and apprehended pain," it is clear that Dewey could not have intended to substitute "obedience" for the "disobedience" of the original and could not have believed that the original read that way, and an emendation is rightly made (IV, 330). Generally, however, misquotations pose more debatable questions for an editor. The Dewey edition does not emend a misquotation from F. H. Bradley that reads "it is here the intellect alone which is [instead of "has"] to be satisfied" ( Middle Works , IV [1977], 58) or one from F. J. E. Woodbridge that reads "by insisting that by [instead of "from"] the nature of mind" (p. 224). It is unlikely that Dewey made these changes intentionally, but one could argue that they are so insignificant as to be allowable in the tradition of approximate quotation; 51 on the other hand one could argue that the "is" and "by" are slips induced in each case by the presence of the same word earlier in the line and that they are simply mistakes that ought to be corrected. Even though approximate quotation is justifiable as a contemporary convention, any misquotation can be expected to alter the meaning slightly, and one must therefore give thought to whether or not the change was intentional. If it appears not to be, then at least where substantives are involved the arguments for retention of the error as an example of the tolerated imprecision of the time would seem in many instances to carry less force than the arguments for emendation. 52 In the Dewey edition a phrase from William James appears as "any one part of experience" (p. 99), whereas the original contains "our" before "experience." How does one draw the line here between allowable imprecision of quotation and a slip that violates the author's intention? Considering the shade of difference in emphasis produced by the omission, one might feel that Dewey could not have regarded the shorter version as an acceptable paraphrase or approximation of the longer and that—unless the shift in nuance can itself be seen as intentional—the omitted word should be restored. These are difficult critical questions, and it should be clear that they are no less difficult because the piece of writing happens to be "nonfiction." 53 Since decisions on such matters must grow out of the immediate context of the passage and the larger context of the author's times and general practice, they will vary from situation to situation; they will also inevitably vary, as with any question involving judgment, according to the person making the decision. Thus Fredson Bowers, editing another late nineteenth-century American philosopher, William James, reverses in his statement of procedure the relative emphasis on retention and correction of misquotation announced in the Dewey edition. In the James edition, he says, "an attempt has been made to identify the exact edition used by James for his quotations from other authors and ordinarily to emend his carelessness of transcription so that the quotation will reproduce exactly what the author wrote." But at some points, he adds, "James altered quotations for his own purposes in such a manner that his version should be respected" ( Pragmatism [1975], p. 182). Correction of misquotation is here the general rule, and retention the exception; and many emendations in quotations, often to correct punctuation or small differences of substantives, are in fact made. 54 There is no question that the approach is critical, and some misquotations are not emended; but there is a bias toward the correction of misquotations, just as there is one toward the retention of them in the Dewey. This difference in emphasis ought to spring from a difference in the evaluation of these authors' intentions in quoting, seen against a background of the conventions of quoting in their time. If in practice it also springs to some extent from the fact that two different editors are performing the work, there can be no objection, so long as all the factors have been taken into account and the evidence is recorded. Critical editing depends on individual judgments, made by people intimately acquainted with the authors and their methods of working; the treatment of quotations can never rest on a mechanical rule, for it must always involve an understanding of the authors' intended use of the quotations as well as of the conventions for quoting within which they are operating. 55 If those conventions even in scholarly writing in the late nieteenth and early twentieth centuries allowed more flexibility than we are now accustomed to, it hardly needs to be stated that the situation was still freer in earlier periods. The point has been well put in the Yale edition of Jonathan Edwards, where in the second volume ( Religious Affections , 1959), John E. Smith explains how the difficulty in the eighteenth century of conveniently consulting all the books one might need made it "necessary to rely upon memory and extracts copied somewhat hastily and stored up for use at a later time" (p. 81). He goes on to describe the kinds of misquotations that occur, in a passage that could apply equally well to many earlier and later writers: Very few of the direct quotations in the Affections are to be found in exactly the same form in the original editions, even though most changes are minor and do not materially affect the meaning involved. Edwards often paraphrased his source, and some of this paraphrased material appears within inverted commas along with direct quotation; the result is that the line between the two is difficult to draw. Edwards also made minor modifications, such as the changing of tenses or the dropping of an article or pronoun, and he often strung together passages from different parts of a book, omitting material in between without use of ellipsis dots. What appears in some cases to be a sentence or paragraph from one page of a work is actually a construction from several pages, and it is identified by him in the citation only by the first page (or the last) from which the quotation is taken. The sentence that follows, however, concludes the paragraph on a questionable note: "The quotations in this edition are left as they appeared in the first edition, so that the interested student might be enabled to examine Edwards' own practice." This approach is an uncritical one, taking for granted that the first edition accurately represents "Edwards' own practice" and not inquiring into the possibility that some readings of the first edition might be errors introduced in the printing process. The editor is right not to make all quotations conform to their sources, but he should not therefore go to the opposite extreme and assume that the quotations as they appear in print are necessarily what the writer intended. The earlier volume of the Edwards edition, Paul Ramsey's text of Freedom of the Will (1957), exhibits the same problem, though the policy is defended somewhat differently. After pointing out the varieties of "quotation" that Edwards engaged in, Ramsey says that in no instance is Edwards "unfaithful to the original author's meaning, or, between the quotation marks, unfair to him" (p. 122). He then adds, rather irrelevantly, "To correct his quotations so as to make them formally quite exact would mutilate the text with bracketed insertions, and to repeat the quotation accurately in a footnote would needlessly burden the page." The basic argument here is that editorial emendation of the quotations is unnecessary because they accurately reflect the gist of the original authors' statements. Such a position does not question whether Edwards intended to represent those statements in exactly the way they appear in the first edition. The Yale Edwards edition, in other words, admirably describes the nature of Edwards's quoting but does not take a critical approach to the treatment of his quotations as they are found in the printed texts. 56 If quotations in nonfiction works should be treated in a critical spirit, it is equally true that bibliographical citations and other references to external facts in them must also be so treated. In Bowers's edition of James's Essays in Radical Empiricism (1976), James's citation of A. S. Pringle-Pattison's book as " Man and the Cosmos " instead of Man's Place in the Cosmos (p. 53) is not emended (though of course the correct title is recorded in the notes), for there is no question about what James wrote, which is a characteristic example of nineteenth-century allusive citation. On the other hand, when Washington Irving, in Mahomet and His Successors , begins a sentence with "The Arabs, says Lane," and ends the paragraph with a correct reference to " Sale's Koran ," it is clear that "Lane" is merely a slip for "Sale," and Henry A. Pochmann and E. N. Feltskog make the emendation (p. 374) in their Wisconsin edition (1970). Joseph J. Moldenhauer and Edwin Moser, in their volume of Early Essays and Miscellanies (1975) in the Princeton edition of Thoreau, attempt to distinguish between erroneous information and typographical errors in Thoreau's sources: when Thoreau gives James Hogg's birthdate as 1772 instead of 1770, they do not correct it, because his source also gives 1772 as the year; but when he follows that source in citing "Madoc of the Moor," they emend "Madoc" to "Mador" on the grounds that the source reading was merely a typographical error. Other editors might disagree with this distinction and argue the case differently; but one cannot quarrel with the Thoreau editors' recognition of the necessity for applying critical judgment to each factual error and not handling all errors by a ready-made rule. In some cases, as the Thoreau edition illustrates, the basis for correcting a factual error in a copy-text may be provided by an author's earlier draft. In Thoreau's fair-copy manuscript of his early essay on "Sir Walter Raleigh," the year 1592 is said to be eight years before Raleigh's imprisonment, but the correct year, 1595, is present in two previous drafts (p. 188); and in The Maine Woods (ed. Moldenhauer, 1972) the copy-text statement that "our party of three paid two dollars" (p. 160) can be corrected by reference to the first draft, where the fare is recorded as three dollars per person (Thoreau's "2" and "9" resemble one another). Factual errors can of course be corrected without such documents, but their existence helps to confirm the author's intention. And that intention is what is crucial: the fact that a piece of writing is "nonfiction" cannot relieve the scholarly editor of the obligation to investigate the author's intention (as perhaps influenced by the customs of the time) before deciding to "correct" what is technically a factual error. These considerations call attention to the fine line that an editor must draw between correcting in the sense of emending a text in the light of the author's intention and correcting in the sense of revising. Henry Pochmann, in the Mahomet edition, is well aware of the problem when he notes that he cannot correct Irving's grammar or syntax "short of making the transition from editing to revising Irving's text" (p. 602). After he describes Irving's methods of constructing approximate quotations, he adds, "Because the primary concern is to reproduce what Irving wrote, or intended to write, the editor has concentrated on what Irving's text shows and has noted or corrected Irving's alterations [of quotations] only when it can be shown that his modifications are erroneous or unintentional, or both." Although the inclusion of the word "erroneous" makes the sentence less clear (since from the editor's point of view the only things that can be erroneous within the text are those that are unintended), this statement is useful both because it sets forth a sensible point of view for handling quotations (and, by extension, other matters involving external fact) and because its seeming ambiguity forces one to focus on the vexing problems of intention. To say that an editor reproduces what an author "wrote, or intended to write" is obviously meant to allow the editor to correct the author's slips of the pen. It is not meant to imply that all factual errors are necessarily slips and are to be corrected by the editor; but the difficulty of constructing a sentence making that distinction explicit suggests the difficulties of the distinction itself. A factual error is not a slip, of course, if an author intentionally alters the facts; but neither is it a slip if the author has copied accurately from an inaccurate source. That the author in the latter case intended to get the facts right does not give the editor license to correct them if there is a reasonable possibility that the erroneous facts have had some influence on the author's thinking and thus have ramifications elsewhere in the text. One is dealing, in other words, with the author's immediate intention in the act of writing; basing editorial decisions on some more programmatic intention to be "accurate" would frequently mean becoming a collaborator of the author and undertaking a new stage of revision which that author never got around to. The editing of Thoreau's college papers, though rather a special case, illustrates the point. Thoreau made some revisions in his papers before submitting them to Edward T. Channing; when Channing marked those papers he was carrying the process of revision—or indicating how to carry it—one stage further. Moldenhauer and Moser, in their Early Essays volume, accept into the text Thoreau's revisions before he submitted the papers but not those made as a result of Channing's directives—"unless," they add, "the original reading is an error that the editors would have emended had Thoreau himself not corrected it" (p. 311). Thus one can correct slips of Thoreau's pen, for to do so is to act in accordance with his intention at the moment of writing; but to adopt revisions prompted by a schoolmaster's markings is to accept an altered intention imposed from outside. The reader is interested in what Thoreau wanted to write, not in what someone else wished him to do. In the same way, any editor who corrects factual errors in texts merely because they are factual errors, without carefully considering the relation of those errors to the author's active intention, is playing the role of the schoolmaster, concerned more with maintaining an a priori standard than with understanding the internal demands of a particular situation. The critical editor is pledged to use judgment: deciding in advance to reproduce the copy-text exactly is not appropriate, for the goal is not a facsimile or diplomatic text; but neither can the critical editor decide in advance to correct all errors of external fact, for the goal is not to carry forward the authorial process of revision. Editorial emendations in a critical text that aims to respect the author's intention must be made in the light of the intention manifested in the version of the work being edited. Whether the work is "fiction" or "nonfiction," the editor must strive to make emendations that are faithful to the spirit of the historical document under consideration and that do not move on into the area of prescriptive correcting. This point of view, particularly when applied to "nonfiction," is bound to raise a question in many readers' minds. Surely, they would say, writers of "nonfiction" set out to be informative, and if one does not correct all their errors one is caring more about the writers as individuals of interest in their own right than about the subjects they are discussing. Where, in other words, do we draw the line between an interest in a piece of writing for the information it conveys and an interest in it as the expression of a particular individual at a specific time? Irving's historical works were intended to be informative, but today we turn to them more to experience Irving's prose and to observe his handling of the material; if we wish to learn the "facts" about the historical events he dealt with, we feel that more recent accounts, based on further research, have superseded his treatments. Similarly, we are not indignant over James's and Dewey's misquotations, because we are interested in the versions that influenced their thought; but if we read current scholarly treatments of the same subjects we regard misquotations and factual errors as faults. The reason is not merely that conventional standards may have become more rigorous; it is that in the former case our interest is historical and in the latter it is not. But what is read today for its "truth" is read tomorrow for its "historical interest"; the same pieces of "nonfiction" move from one status to the other, and the editor is not faced with two discrete bodies of material, but only one, which in fact comprises all writing. The distinction to be made is between kinds of editing, not kinds of writing. What is called editing in a magazine- or book-publisher's office is not historically oriented, and publishers' editors hope to find and eliminate factual errors—that is, what can be regarded as errors in the light of current knowledge—in the manuscripts they prepare for publication. When a scholarly editor undertakes to edit a text, however, the task is retrospective and the interest historical, no matter how recent the piece of writing happens to be. If a publisher's editor had informed F. O. Matthiessen that he was quoting a corrupt text of White-Jacket with the reading "soiled fish" for "coiled fish," he would have revised his discussion accordingly, for it was not his aim to analyze a phrase Melville never wrote. But if a scholarly editor were to prepare an edition of Matthiessen's book, nothing could be done about rectifying the erroneous "soiled," which forms the basis for an analysis of "the unexpected linking of the medium of cleanliness with filth." 57 Even if Matthiessen had not made a point of the word "soiled," the scholarly editor would have to think very carefully before correcting it in the quotation, for Matthiessen quoted accurately the Constable text, assuming it to be correct, and that text is the one lying behind his commentary. The critical activity of the scholarly editor is directed toward recovering what an author intended at a particular time, whether that time was yesterday, four decades ago, or four centuries ago. 58 This principle applies to matters of external fact just as much as to any other feature of the work, although editors sometimes seem more tempted to abandon their historical orientation when dealing with those matters. Reference to Matthiessen's discussion of "soiled" is a reminder that on many occasions an author's elaboration of an erroneous point makes any emendation out of the question: it is fruitless to consider—except as an exercise—whether or not one would emend "soiled" if Matthiessen had not discussed the word, because in fact he did discuss it, and one cannot rewrite the passage for him. Quite apart from questions of intention, then, there is always the practical question of whether or not any alteration is feasible. Presumably Yeats did not intend to misquote two lines from Burns so that they contain the phrase "white moon" rather than "wan moon," but his penetrating analysis of the use of "white" in the passage eliminates any possibility of editorial correction. 59 Situations involving internal contradiction as well as external fact may be such that an editor has no alternative but to leave them alone. When Ahab appears in "his slouched hat" (Chapter 132) just two chapters after a hawk has flown off with it (and we are told that it "was never restored"), an editor is powerless to make a change that will produce consistency. Similarly, when Melville describes the baleen of the right whale (Chapter 75), he has a sentence pointing out that "One voyager in Purchas" calls these bones one thing, "another" calls them something else, and "a third old gentleman in Hackluyt" speaks of them in a still different way. The fact is that the third quotation is a paraphrase of Purchas, not Hakluyt; but if "Purchas" were to be substituted for "Hackluyt," Purchas would be named twice, and the rhetorical effect of the sentence would be changed. What is a factual error must be allowed to stand (whether or not Melville meant to be accurate here) because the error plays a role in the rhetoric of the passage as he wrote it, and correcting the error would amount to stylistic revision. 60 There are thus two considerations that need to be kept in mind in dealing with factual errors. First one must consider whether a correction can realistically be undertaken. If a correction involves only a simple substitution, then it can be seriously considered; but if the erroneous information has been referred to repeatedly or been made the basis of further comment, there is no way to make the correction, short of more extensive rewriting and alteration than a scholarly editor can contemplate. This consideration is purely a practical one and has nothing to do with authorial intention: some errors can be considered for correction, others cannot. In the latter case, there is no point debating what the author intended, for no alteration can be attempted; besides, the use to which the error has been put makes it in effect an intended part of the text, even if it originated as a slip. But in the case of errors that can feasibly be corrected, the editor must take up the second, and more difficult, kind of consideration, to determine whether or not they ought to be corrected. It is here that the editor's critical assessment of all relevant factors is crucial—an assessment of the nature of the sentence and passage where the error occurs, the observed habits of the author, the conventions of the time. Decisions to emend must rest on informed critical judgment, and no less so where questions of external fact are concerned. Clear thinking about emendations of factual errors requires that these two levels of consideration be thoroughly understood: the recognition, first of all, that some errors by their nature are unemendable; and, second, the awareness that any mechanical rule of thumb for handling the emendable errors involves an abandonment of the editor's critical function. The reasons for leaving Keats's "Cortez" alone are therefore somewhat more complicated than those Amy Lowell seems to imply when she says that Keats used the name "probably by accident" but that "It is no matter." To say that what an author puts into a text "by accident" is "no matter" suggests an uncritical approach to the text; it implies an acceptance of whatever is present in a particular text, as if one were approaching the text of a working document, where one is interested in preserving false starts and errors for their psychological significance. But the sonnet is a finished work of art, not merely a literary document, and it demands to be edited critically, with attention to possible emendations to restore the author's intention. Whether Keats intended to disregard historical fact or confused the historical Balboa with Cortez, however, need not be pondered, for there is no question that "Cortez" is the word he put into the poem at this point, and the role which that word plays in the patterns of sound and rhythm in the poem makes it an integral element of the work. Furthermore, the connotations of "Cortez" are such that it is able to serve as a vehicle to carry the intended tenor of the figure. This is one of those situations where an "error" is unemendable because the use made of it within the work rules out any editorial attempt to rectify it. "Cortez" must remain, not because author's accidents do not matter, but because it—accident or not in origin—became, as Keats wrote, an inextricable part of the work. Probably Amy Lowell had such points in mind, but her elliptical statement does not make them clear and even seems to encourage the view that the accuracy of external references in literary works need not be seriously investigated. References to external fact, as in this instance, raise textual questions because they call attention to a second "text" (the historical fact) with which the text under consideration can be compared. Editorial attention is necessarily drawn to variants between two or more texts of a work; but a critical editor's duty is also to try to identify any errors in a text at points where variants do not exist or in cases where there is only one text. If quotations or other references to external fact or uses of external documents are involved, the editor has assistance in this task that is not otherwise available, for a point of comparison outside the immediate text can be established. At many other places in a text one has no basis for speculating about whether a reading is erroneous, but when words are quoted from another writer or a date is cited, for example, one can compare the text with the outside source or fact. Even in cases of paraphrase (or translation), where a passage is loosely based on an external source, knowledge of the wording of that source is relevant. Differences found in the text are not necessarily to be regarded as errors, but in many cases familiarity with the external facts enables one to recognize a slip of the pen or a misreading of handwriting that could not have been detected any other way. And in instances where only printed texts or late manuscripts are available, such knowledge allows one to speculate about certain readings in now lost anterior documents, for one can know the sources that underlie parts of those documents. Recognizing that writers need not be held to strict accuracy in their historical allusions does not eliminate the critical editor's responsibility for checking each allusion and making a textual decision about it. The presence in a text of quotations, paraphrases, or references to historical fact undoubtedly raises some perplexing editorial questions; but it also provides editors with a splendid opportunity of demonstrating what critical editing at its most effective can accomplish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 John Keats (1925), p. 181. 2 In the Odyssey Press edition of the Complete Poems and Selected Letters (1935), p. 45. 3 See the Indiana edition of April Hopes , ed. Don L. Cook et al. (1974), pp. 221-222; and Moby-Dick , Chapter 61. 4 This point is taken up in more detail below, in Part II. 5 The two-paragraph prefatory note to the "Extracts" warns the reader not to take the "whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology" and claims for them only that they provide "a glancing bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own." 6 Some critics, such as Viola Sachs in La Contre-Bible de Melville (1975), assume that all readings of the American first edition were intended by Melville, and they erect their interpretations on that assumption. This approach is uncritical and unrealistic in that it does not admit the possibility that the American text might contain transmissional errors or other unintended readings. But it does draw attention to the fact that the critical editor, in deciding what constitutes an error in the text, may be called upon to assess the soundness of various critics' commentaries. 7 References such as this to the text of Moby-Dick are to the text of the original American edition (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1851), which was set from the manuscript furnished by Melville and which must serve (in the absence of that manuscript) as the copy-text for a scholarly critical edition. The attention only to wording—and generally not to punctuation and spelling—is commented on below. In the examples to follow, I draw on information turned up by various members of the editorial staff of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville. The problems in the "Extracts" will be more fully and systematically dealt with in the forthcoming Moby-Dick volume in that edition. For valuable comments on an earlier version of this essay—both the part on Melville and the more general part—I am indebted to Fredson Bowers, Harrison Hayford, and Richard Colles Johnson. 8 In the passage from William Tooke's edition of Lucian (1820), Melville's alterations seem clearly to result from his wishing to change the diction: "sea" replaces "deep" and "monstrous" replaces "enormous" (though this second change could involve a misreading of handwriting). In the extract from William Scoresby, the distance at which one can hear the shaking of the whale's tail is said to be "three or four miles" rather than the "two or three miles" of the original, an obvious change for exaggeration. And in the quotation from Thomas Beale "Sperm Whale" is substituted for "sea beast," a change making more explicit the reference to whales. 9 Some evidence suggesting that Melville intended to quote accurately in certain instances is available at those points where the original English edition (set from Melville's revised proofs of the American edition) corrects the American, since no one other than Melville would have been likely to bother making such changes. One example is the correction in the English edition of the reading "stuffed with hoops" to "stiff with hoops" in a line from The Rape of the Lock ; for other examples, see note 10 and the discussion of the Bunyan citation below. (Of course, some literate person in the English printing- or publishing-house could conceivably have been responsible for certain corrections of this kind; but the pattern of the corrections and the nature of some of the sources involved suggest a greater likelihood that the corrections are Melville's.) 10 Another example possibly involving an idiom could result in a different decision, because of differing circumstances. The quotation from Charles Wilkes's Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition (1844) contains the phrase "with look-outs at the mastheads," although Wilkes uses the singular "mast-head." To employ the plural when more look-outs than one are involved is an idiom Melville uses repeatedly (as in "the business of standing mast-heads," "the earliest standers of mast-heads," and "modern standers-of-mast-heads" in Chapter 35); furthermore, he apparently gave close attention to this extract in preparing the proofs to send to England, because the reading "her near appearance" in the American edition is altered to the correct one, "her mere appearance," in the English, and it is unlikely that anyone other than Melville would have made such a correction from this kind of source. Under these circumstances, then, there seems stronger reason to leave "mast-heads" than to change it, even though the possibility always remains that it results from a slip or a misreading of handwriting. 11 The possibility that Melville used either a revised or a corrupt text and misquoted from it in such a way as to produce the reading of the first edition is hardly worth the editor's while to think about in most instances. It is conceivable, however, that such a situation could occasionally be of some importance, if an author were attempting to reproduce a passage from a revised edition of a work and through an unlucky slip managed to recreate the reading of the unrevised text; but this occurrence would of course depend on an extreme coincidence. 12 In some cases another extract may provide a clue to the source. The quotation from John Hunter is a paraphrase of the original wording in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1787; but it matches exactly (except for the omission of "an") the wording quoted by William Paley in his Natural Theology (1802)—which is the work Melville cites for the immediately following extract. 13 These different kinds of intention are discussed in more detail in G. T. Tanselle, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," Studies in Bibliography , 29 (1976), 167-211 (which includes references to many other treatments of the subject). An important and still more recent discussion, containing some useful criticism of that essay, is Steven Mailloux's "Authorial Intention and Conventional Reader Response," Chapter 7 (pp. 171-206) of his University of Southern California dissertation, "Interpretive Conventions and Recent Anglo-American Literary Theory" (1977). 14 Melvyn New has encountered a situation in which he believes that an editor should employ as the copy-text for a long quotation the first edition of the work quoted from. In Tristram Shandy Sterne quotes the entire "Memoire" from Heinrich van Deventer's Observations importantes sur le Manuel des accouchemens (1734); New argues that "Much of the wit of the 'Memoire's' inclusion in Tristram lies in the fact that Sterne could use it verbatim," that "it is not a fiction but an historical record of an actual deliberation." One can guess, New says, that "had Sterne had photoreproductive processes available to him, he would have used them for providing a printer's copy of the 'Memoire'" and that one "comes closest to Sterne's intention" by using the 1734 Deventer text. New recognizes, however, that this text would have to be emended with what seem to be Sterne's intended alterations and that punctuation "remains a difficult problem, whichever text is used as copy text"—thus in fact reopening the question of how much is gained by adopting the earlier copy-text. Whether or not one is persuaded by New that presumptive authority here should be given to the 1734 text, one can agree that the problem is to separate Sterne's "function as copyist" from his "function as artist" (due allowance, of course, being made for contemporary conventions of "copying") and that "in the text underlying any borrowed material there is the possibility of a wealth of bibliographical and critical information." See " Tristram Shandy and Heinrich van Deventer's Observations ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 84-90; and "The Sterne Edition: The Text of Tristram Shandy ," in Editing Eighteenth Century Novels , ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. (1975), pp. 86-87. 15 The extract from Darwin in fact illustrates two practices: the insertion of "(whales)" occurs within the quotation, whereas the quotation is interrupted—by the use of closing and then opening quotation marks—for the insertion of "(Terra Del Fuego)" after "the shore." 16 The same situation occurs in the quotation from Margaret Fuller's translation of Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe , where Melville has silently omitted "and seamonsters" following "whales." 17 Transitional words in source passages form another obviously intended class of omissions. The omission of "other" from "what other thing" in the extract from Philemon Holland's edition of Plutarch and of "on the other hand" from a quotation from Frederick Debell Bennett are necessary adjustments when the passages are taken out of context. 18 "Herman Melville's Whaling Years" (Vanderbilt diss., 1952), p. 224. 19 Knowledge of the range of variant spellings recorded in the DAE for the Indian evil deity—including "Hobomoko," "Abamacho," and "Hobbamock"—might cause one to argue that "Hobomack" falls within the range of permissible deviation, but presumably such a range did not exist for the ship's name. A different kind of argument against emending the spelling would be to say that the correction does not make the citation fit the extract better than it did before and that under the circumstances the Hobomack becomes in effect a fictitious ship of Melville's invention. The great similarity between "Hobomack" and "Hobomok," however, makes it difficult to believe that Melville did not have the real ship in mind. And an editor's intervention to correct Melville's intended reference in the citation carries no implication that the extract and the citation are being brought into closer agreement: there is no reason why Melville cannot be allowed to place on board a real ship events that never occurred there, and no reason why an editor cannot make a local correction of a spelling error without being obligated to produce factual accuracy in the larger context. 20 A related kind of approximate citation occurs in the reference to " Opening sentence of Hobbes's Leviathan ." The sentence quoted is actually the fifth, but " Opening " should not therefore be called an error: " Opening sentence " is apparently what Melville wrote, meaning "a sentence that is part of the opening," "an early sentence." 21 A third error in the Montgomery extract, "instincts" for "instinct," should be corrected because the word is correct in Cheever and because the misreading could easily have resulted from a slip. 22 On another occasion, a date in a citation identifies the actual edition used. The citation " Captain Cowley's Voyage around the Globe. A.D. 1729 " is not an error, even though Cowley's voyage took place in 1683—86 and an account of it appeared in William Hacke's A Collection of Voyages in 1699, because another edition of Hacke appeared in 1729. Melville's date, therefore, refers to his source and not to the actual voyage. 23 The last two words in the list differ by one letter: "pekee-nuee-nuee" for Fegee, and "pehee-nuee-nuee" for Erromangoan. Whereas "pehee" is an acceptable rendering of the word for "fish" usually transcribed as "pihi," "pekee" is not; yet an editor must be cautious about emending it, for Melville's desire to show different words may have taken precedence here over any desire to offer precisely accurate information. (Using this argument here would not prevent an editor from correcting a factual error elsewhere in the list where the circumstances were different.) 24 Assuming that Melville would not have intended to give the Old Icelandic "hvalr." (If "whalr" were a variant of "hvalr," it might be a tempting possibility, differing from "whale" by only one letter; but it is a highly improbable form.) The Northwestern-Newberry editors are grateful to Richard N. Ringler for help with this problem. 25 Course in General Linguistics , ed. Charles Bally, Albert Sechehaye, and Albert Reidlinger, and trans. Wade Baskin (1959), pp. 13-14. 26 No distinct line separates the two. What may seem nonsense in one context may become concrete poetry in another. 27 Archibald A. Hill, in "The Locus of the Literary Work," English Studies Today , 3rd ser. (1964), pp. 41-50, after discussing the bearing of Saussure's distinction on literary study, defines "intention" as a "structural hypothesis derived from analysis of the text" (p. 50). A fuller discussion of this point occurs in G. T. Tanselle's "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention" (see note 13 above). 28 Validity in Interpretation (1967), p. 233. The role of literary sensitivity in determining the function of misquotation in an author's writing is well illustrated by Christopher Ricks in "Pater, Arnold and Misquotation," Times Literary Supplement , 25 Nov. 1977, pp. 1383—85. Ricks concludes that Pater reads "what he wishes to have been said": he creates a "'world within' . . . only by a violation of a world without, another man's 'world within' as it had become embodied . . . in the inter-subjective world which is the words of a poem." Whereas "Pater's misquotations are the rewriting of his authors so that they say special Paterian things," Arnold's "are the rewriting of his authors so that they say unspecial things," reducing "something individual to something commonplace." Another discussion of the creative use of quotations, pointing a parallel with the developing text of a ballad through oral tradition, is M. J. C. Hodgart's "Misquotation as Re-creation," Essays in Criticism , 3 (1953), 28-38. Misquotations that become integral parts of the works in which they occur are to be distinguished, of course, from incidental slips, even when those slips may have some kind of psychological significance (this point is discussed further below). 29 Twice-Told Tales , ed. J. Donald Crowley, Fredson Bowers, et al. (1974), pp. 169-170; The Snow-Image and Uncollected Tales (1974), p. 142; The Blithedale Romance and Fanshawe , ed. Fredson Bowers et al. (1964), p. 408. 30 Within a given language, that is, for the spelling is sometimes altered for representation in other languages. 31 This spelling also occurs in Chapter 75. 32 The Snow-Image and Uncollected Tales (1974), p. 96. 33 For some additional comment on this point, see G. T. Tanselle, "Textual Study and Literary Judgment," PBSA , 65 (1971), 120-121. 34 This is what I take to be the meaning of the sentence reading "Howells' choice of detail seems to place the fiction at roughly the same time as the historical events upon which it draws." See A Hazard of New Fortunes , ed. David J. Nordloh et al. (1976), pp. 55, 537-538. 35 As Harold H. Kolb, Jr., points out in his review of this volume of the Howells edition in American Literary Realism 1870-1910 , 10 (1977), 314-317. Another possible detail suggesting a pre-1888 date for the early part of the novel is the streetcar strike described late in the book, if it is to be identified with the New York strike of early 1889 (certainly it was inspired by that strike. 36 Of course, if "tventy years ago" can be taken to mean "roughly twenty years ago," there would be no inconsistency with either version of the other sentence. But the theoretical question remains, even if the present illustration, in that case, were not particularly apt; and there would still be the problem, in this illustration, of choosing between "not yet" and "already," even though one difficulty in making the choice would have been removed. (Determining how exact the reference to twenty years was intended to be involves some consideration of linguistic customs and traditions: the vagueness about round numbers prevalent in Elizabethan times, for instance, seems to be of a different order from the attitude toward such figures in Howells's time.) 37 A similar instance, involving the dating of the narration of a novel, occurs in Moby-Dick . A speculative passage in Chapter 85 refers to "this blessed minute" and then defines it (in the first American edition) as "fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851." Because the book was published in London in October 1851 and in New York in November 1851, the year in this passage is probably a compositorial error for "1850" (the reading in the first English edition, set from proofs of the first American). As far as internal consistency is concerned, of course, "1851" would cause a problem only if there is another historical reference in the book with which it would come in conflict. But it seems most likely that Melville's intention at this point was to make the internal world of the book and the external world of reality coincide and to refer to a date that was realistically conceivable as the actual date of composition of this passage (if not in fact the actual date). John Harmon McElroy, in "The Dating of the Action in Moby Dick ," Papers on Language &amp; Literature , 13 (1977), 420-423, comments on the 1850 date of narration and on other historical references that date the Pequod's voyage in 1840-41. 38 I am not suggesting that fact is ever anything but elusive, even outside of fiction; but this is not the place to raise the philosophical question of what is real. By "fact" here, as I have tried to define it earlier, I mean specific people, places, things, and events with an existence independent of the work under consideration. Saul Bellow has interestingly discussed the role of facts in fiction in "Facts That Put Fancy to Flight," New York Times Book Review , 11 Feb. 1962, pp. 1, 28. Many readers, he says, are concerned with the accuracy of the realistic surface, and publishers' editors will therefore wish to check on such questions as "How many stories does the Ansonia Hotel really have; and can one see its television antennae from the corner of West End Avenue and Seventy-second Street?" He proceeds to contrast writers who are "satisfied with an art of externals" (and who produce "a journalistic sort of novel") with those "masters of realism" in whose work "the realistic externals were intended to lead inward." 39 See, for instance, the comments on "Washington: Behind Closed Doors" in Time , 19 Sept. 1977, pp. 92-93, and in Michael J. Arlen's "The Air" department in The New Yorker , 3 Oct. 1977, pp. 115-124. 40 They discuss this category of emendations on pp. 215-216. 41 "The American Heritage and Its Guardians," American Scholar , 45 (1975-76), 733-751 [i.e., 37-55]; quotation from p. 742. 42 The rationale for this position is set forth by G. T. Tanselle in "The Editing of Historical Documents," SB , 31 (1978), 1-56. 43 The Journal of Sir Walter Scott (1972), pp. 425, 412. 44 This is not to suggest that a critical text cannot be undertaken to represent any particular stage in the history of a work, for the same point can be made about the relation of the surviving documents to the author's final intention at any specific time. Producing a critical text of some version of a work that was later revised further by the author is not the same thing as editing a transcription of one document. 45 In a footnote, Shaw gives another, and more far-fetched, example of a slip "useful to the critic": the appearance of F. R. Leavis's name as "F. L. Leavis" in an essay of Fredson Bowers. Shaw believes that "Leavis evidently has been confused with the older English critic F. L. Lucas" and that this slip reveals a "slightly old-fashioned" cast of mind. Surely such tenuous speculation offers no real grounds for preserving what is clearly an unintended reading, very likely a compositor's error. 46 Another Hayford-Sealts emendation in Billy Budd has been questioned by another critic in a different way. In his Bobbs-Merrill edition (1975), Milton Stern differs from Hayford and Sealts on the necessity of correcting Nelson's rank, from "Vice Admiral" (as it appears on leaf 70 of the manuscript) to "Rear Admiral" (as Hayford and Sealts correct it). Stern does not rule out all corrections of fact and believes in making critical distinctions between one situation and another. His argument in this case is that Melville "makes a point of Nelson's rank more than once"; therefore "he might have attached significance to the ranks he assigned" (p. 165). This argument, however, is not critical: the fact that the error appears more than once is no guarantee that it was intended; the crucial question, not taken up, is whether there is reason to believe that Melville did attach significance to "Vice Admiral." 47 Theory of Literature (1949), p. 15. 48 See, for instance, Stanley Edgar Hyman's The Tangled Bank: Darwin, Marx, Frazer and Freud as Imaginative Writers (1962). 49 A number of them are listed by G. T. Tanselle in SB , 29 (1976), 176, footnote 19. 50 Bowers suggests that one of the uses of this appendix is to help the reader decide "whether Dewey had the source open before him or was relying on his memory" (p. xvii)—a problem the editor will already have thought about in determining whether any emendations are justifiable, for certain kinds of slips are more common when one is copying (intending to copy accurately) than when one is remembering (intending perhaps only to paraphrase). 51 Boydston points out in the first volume of The Early Works that "Dewey used source material in the whole range of possible ways, from paraphrase recall to verbatim copying out. . . . quotation marks do not necessarily signal a direct, precise quotation" (p. lxxxix). 52 The same cannot necessarily be said about accidentals: because it is more difficult to reason about which discrepancies in accidentals are intentional and which inadvertent, the decision whether or not to correct the accidentals of a quotation falls back more heavily on a consideration of contemporary attitudes toward accuracy in quotations. (For works in which some looseness of quotation is tolerated, there is the companion question of the extent to which readers need to be informed about the accidentals of the original; whereas discrepancies in substantives between copy-text and source should always be reported in the apparatus, one can argue that the desirability of reporting such discrepancies in accidentals varies with the situation—perhaps, for instance, being more important for some expository works or passages than for some "creative" ones.) 53 Some debate over editing quotations in such works has recently occurred in connection with the omission of a "not" in a quotation from Joseph Spence as it appears in the first edition of Johnson's Life of Pope (1781). Colin J. Horne's proposal that the word be restored ("An Emendation to Johnson's Life of Pope," Library , 5th ser., 28 [1973], 156-157) has been objected to by J. P. Hardy, who argues that "surely the modern editor's prime duty is to reproduce the most authoritative text that can, on all available evidence, be attributed to Johnson" (29 [1974], 226). Horne's reply (30 [1975], 249-250) tries to clarify the nature of critical editing, especially in regard to quotations: such an editor, Horne recognizes, does not simply reproduce an authoritative text but corrects it so that it can be printed "as the author intended it to be and not as what, by some oversight, he actually wrote in error"; and this principle, he makes clear, must apply to the entire text, quotations and all (he underscores the illogic of holding "that one principle should apply to quotations and quite another to the main body of the text"). That certain misquotations in "nonfiction" or expository works must, however, be allowed to stand is effectively stated by Horne: "No editor, I think, would correct the habitual misquotations in Hazlitt's writings because, it may fairly be claimed, they are, in that form, what Hazlitt intended. They are authentic as being precisely how he remembered them and as such they are evidence of his adaptive memory of his extensive reading and his partly deliberate adaptation of the quotation to what he was himself writing." 54 The list of emendations in this edition is designed as the place to record all differences in the texts of quotations, even those that are not emended. The principle of providing readers with this information (handled in the Dewey by the section called "Correction of Quotations") is important, for without it readers are not in a position adequately to evaluate the editors' treatment of quotations; readers need to know where misquotations have been allowed to stand as well as where they have been emended. 55 James's preface to The Meaning of Truth illustrates the delicacy of judgment involved, because James there quotes from his own earlier Pragmatism . The editor is faced not only with the usual questions that quotations raise but with the additional consideration that James may be taking this occasion to revise what he had previously written. Bowers's text (1975) allows James to make unmarked omissions but generally restores the punctuation and italicization of the original. 56 And this edition, it should be added, is not one that excludes all editorial emendation; in fact, it is a modernized edition. (Ramsey's point that the text is not "put forth in completely modern form" refers only to the fact that idioms and other matters of wording are not modernized.) But the inappropriateness of modernization for a scholarly edition of this kind is an entirely different point from the one I am concerned with here. 57 American Renaissance (1941), p. 392. The error was originally pointed out by John W. Nichol in "Melville's '"Soiled" Fish of the Sea,'" American Literature , 21 (1949-50), 338-339. 58 The result may be a "new" version in the sense that the text never existed physically in this form before, but the aim is still historical reconstruction, not the application of critical ability to the further "revision" or "improvement" of the work beyond the point where the author left it. 59 This example, and other similar ones, are discussed in Hodgart's "Misquotation as Re-creation" (see note 28 above), pp. 36-37. The creative nature of Yeats's misquotations is also taken up in Jon Lanham's "Some Further Textual Problems in Yeats: Ideas of Good and Evil ," PBSA , 71 (1977), esp. 455-457, 467. 60 The situation is somewhat more complicated, since the first reference has not been found in Purchas, and it may be erroneous also. But neither has it been located in Hakluyt, so there is no basis for switching the two names. These difficulties may support the view that Melville was more concerned here with rhetorical effect than with factual accuracy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Sixteenth-Century Stationers' Wills by Wayne H. Phelps</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Information about stationers in England during the first hundred years of printing continues to be relatively sparse. Duff's Century of the English Book Trade (1905), containing "short notices of all printers, stationers, book-binders, and others connected with it" from 1457 to 1557, remains the single authoritative work on the subject. At its initial publication, Duff himself perceived the incompleteness of his book and invited assistance "in correcting the errors or in adding new names or facts." Even in reissuing the book in 1948, the Bibliographical Society saw the reprint as only "an interim measure" and recognized the necessity for new editions, not only of Duff, but also of the Dictionaries of McKerrow, Plomer, and others. 1 Presented below are abstracts of the wills of thirteen stationers, all of whom practised their trade and died during the sixteenth century. The earliest will is that of William Breton, who began publishing in 1506 and whose will (prepared in 1517) was probated in 1526; the latest is that of James Gonneld, who died in 1594. Three of the men (James Gonneld, Stephen Kevall, and Randall Tyrer) appear in the list of 97 charter members of the Stationers' Company in 1557. 2 Duff includes entries for eleven of the men, while the other two (Jerome Glover and Henry Middleton) appear in McKerrow. The wills of eight of these stationers have not been noted before. Of the remaining five, Duff mentions the wills of James Gonneld, Stephen Kevall, Philip Scapulis, and Henry Taverner, and McKerrow cites Henry Middleton's will, but neither Duff nor McKerrow furnishes virtually any information beyond the dates of will and probate (except for Kevall, whose will was probated in two different courts). Plomer provides an abstract of Kevall's will, as probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, but both he and Duff missed Jane Kevall's will, which is dated much later than her supposed death. In addition, Plomer lists the wills of Henry Middleton and John Taverner, but does not give any details from the documents. In 1903, when Plomer published abstracts of forty stationers' wills, he observed "the value of wills as historical documents" and noted as his object the illustrating of "the history of printing and bookselling" by means of those documents. Plomer's wills revealed three things: the close association of the stationers with each other in the form of "a guild or brotherhood," the Stationers' Company's enormous wealth as a result of bequests from its members, and the availability of new information about the biographies of individual stationers and about the book trade in general. 3 While some intrinsic interest inheres in any stationer's will, its true value transcends any fascination with the document for its own sake. A stationer's will can be an important index to financial worth, family, and associates. Besides supplying a desired terminal date for publishing activity, the document can furnish an address where the stationer practised his trade, as well as the names of a wife and children—clues, in short, that can assist in future searches. It is in that spirit that the following abstracts are offered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Breton Breton (or Bretton) was a publisher of six liturgical and other religious works, all printed at Paris for sale in London between 1506 and 1510: the Constitutiones of Lyndewode and Athon (1505/6, STC 17109), the Sarum Horae (1506, STC 15903), the Psalterium cum hymnis (1506, STC 16258), the Sarum Graduale (1507, STC 15862), the Pupilla Oculi of Joannes de Burgo (1510, STC 4115), and another edition of the Sarum Horae (1510, STC 15909). Duff (p. 18) adds to this list the Speculum Spiritualium (Paris: Wolfgang Hopyl, 1510), but omits the Sarum Graduale . From three wills in the Public Record Office (all probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury), it is clear that he was the son of Thomas and Agnes Breton. On 22 September 1485, "Thomas Breten n Alderman of london n " made his will, in which he specifies that he "be buried . . . in the chirch of saint mary at hille by billingesgate in london n " (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 7/Logge 15). He divides his estate in three parts: one-third for charity, one-third for his wife, and one-third for his children. He makes a bequest to the fellowship of Ironmongers, designates William Horne overseer of the will, and names as his four executors his wife, his son, John Storke, and his cousin William Curle. All except his son (who was probably too young) probated the will on 15 November 1485. On 21 September 1516, "Agnes Breton n of london n widowe late the wife of Thomas Breton n decessed Citezein while he lyved and Aldreman n of the Citie of london n " had her will drawn (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 18/Holder 25). In it, she requests burial within the parish church of St. Dionis Backchurch, London, in the Chapel of St. John the Evangelist, where her husband was buried, and she provides 50 marks for masses over a period of five years. Her residuary legatee is her son, William Breton, whom she names sole executor; she designates her son-in-law, Sir Laurence Aylmer, knight and Alderman of London, overseer of her will, which William Breton probated on 26 November 1516. Finally, "William Breton n of london n grocer and m er chau n t of the Staple of Caleis" made his will on 26 April 1517 (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 22/Porch 9). His charitable bequests include money for the Observant Friars at Greenwich, the London parishes of St. Dunstan in the East and of St. Dionis Back-church, the Fraternity of Our Lady Barking in London, the five orders of friars in London, the convent of Minors without Aldgate, and the prisoners in the Counters in London and Ludgate. He leaves 40 s. each to Thomas Aylmer and Antony Burley; 20 s. each to his servants Antony Crull, Robert Pynchebek, Alice Lawdys, and Jane; and 40 s. to the Almshouse of Mariners in Deptford. He provides for a priest to sing for his mother, "Annes" Breton, for five years, in accordance with her will, and he bequeaths five marks toward reparations of the housing belonging to the Chantry of Master Darbys in the parish of St. Dionis, where his father Thomas Breton and his mother Annes Breton were buried. He leaves the residue of his estate to his then unmarried and under-age daughter, Anne Breton, and he names as his executors his brother-in-law, Sir Laurence Aylmer, knight and Alderman of London, and his sister Lady Julian Aylmer (Sir Laurence's wife). In his own hand, he added (probably at a later date) that if his sister Julian were to die before settling his estate, then his cousin Antony Burley was to administer his goods. On 23 July 1526, Burley renounced administration of Breton's estate, and on 14 August 1526 administration was granted to Sir Laurence Aylmer, knight, and William Basset, citizen and ironmonger of London (Lady Julian having died).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Martin Deyter Martin Dature, or Datier, or Dotier, flourished as a London bookbinder and stationer between 1543 and 1556, though he is mentioned as early as 1527. His edition of the Sarum Manual (STC 16150) was printed at Rouen in 1543 (Duff, p. 37). According to the Stationers' Register, "marten Detter" was assessed 12 d. for Bridewell in February 1555/6, and he presented "William pore" as his apprentice on 15 October 1556 (Arber, I, 41, 48). That he died in September 1563 is clear from his will, which was probated in the Archdeaconry Court of London that month (Guildhall Library MS. 9051/3, fols. 72 v -74 v ). In his will, dated 8 September, he describes himself as "Martyn Deyter of London bookebynder being syck in bodie" and asks to be buried in the "parrishe Churche of saint marye magdalen besydes oldefyshestreete in London whereof I am a p ar ishener." (The parish registers of St. Mary Magdalen's, Old Fish Street, are lost before 1664.) His principal beneficiaries are his son Martyn Deyter (then under 21), his late manservant William Poore (i.e., his apprentice in 1556), and his late maidservant Julian King—all of whom are bequeathed specified household items. He gives his apprentice James Blankes 5 s. and one year off the term of his apprenticeship, and he leaves 6 s. 8 d. to the poor-men's box in the French Church in London. Others named in the will are the widow Alice Gare, Goodwife Knight, his godson Martyn Sawyer, Jervis Sawyer and his wife, Margaret Sallowaye, his nurse and servant Helen, his servant James Swyeson, and William Pollyn, a haberdasher beside the Little Conduit. He leaves the residue of his estate (including goods, paper, boards, and movables) to his servant Richard Pickeryn (Pickerene, Pickering), whom he designates sole executor; as overseer, he names his friend John White, draper. Witnesses to the will were William Pollyn, John White, and Nicholas Pawlyn, scrivener, who prepared the will. Pickering probated the will on 18 September 1563.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerome Glover Glover was a London bookseller between 1559 and 1568. 4 In 1558-59, Robert Holder presented "Jeronimo glover" to be freed; in 1562-63, Glover was fined 12 d. for selling books by Nostradamus, and in 1564-65 he and sixteen others paid a total of 8 s. 10 d. "for Stechen of bookes." Humffray Cottrell was apprenticed to him for nine years, beginning 25 December 1564, and Thomas Cudner for seven years, beginning 24 August 1565. In 1567-68, he was licensed to publish Valentine Leigh's Surveying of Lands (cf. STC 15416, and see Arber, I, 99, 217, 255, 277, 286, 355). This stationer can probably be identified with the "Ierome Glover of the parishe of Sentfaithes in the citie of London n sicke in bodye" whose undated will was probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury in 1569 (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 51/Sheffeld 14). He gives to his wife Margaret, and to the child with whom she was then pregnant, all of his goods and property, including some real estate in the parish of Wye, Kent. He names his brother, Richard Glover, residuary legatee and gives 40 s. each to the children of his brothers and sisters. He asks that Mary Glover be paid the part of her portion still in his possession, and he leaves 2 s. each to his three servants and to his aunt Holder (perhaps related to the stationer Robert Holder). John Bretton witnessed the will, which Glover's widow Margaret probated (as executrix) on 16 June 1569. (The register copy of the will shows that the document was signed "by me Richard Glover," apparently an error by the Court scribe; Jerome's brother Richard was probably another witness to the will.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Gonneld Gonneld's name is one of the 97 in the Stationers' Company's charter of 1557. He was an important figure in the Company (as a Warden for four years between 1565 and 1576 and as Master for three years between 1579 and 1586), but he was neither a printer nor a publisher. In 1563, Robert Sysaye (see below) appointed Gonneld one of the supervisors of his will. Numerous references to him occur in the Stationers' Register. Duff (pp. 57-58) cites Gonneld's will, which was probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury in 1594, but he does not provide any information from the document. On 16 November 1594, "Iames Gonnelde Citizen and Stacioner of London being at this present sicke in my bodye" made his will (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 84/Dixy 85). He mentions his wife Katherine (whom he names sole executrix), his son Benjamin Gonneld (whom Duff notes as being in holy orders), and his four daughters—Dorothy Baker, Katherine Gonneld, Sara Gonneld, and Dorcas Gonneld. (His three younger daughters were under 21 and unmarried at the time.) According to his will, Gonneld held the reversion of certain property in Chick Lane near Smithfield pens, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, London, and he lived in his mansion house near Smithfield Bars, London. He declares himself free of the Company of Stationers, to whom he leaves 40 s. to make merry, and he leaves the same amount each to the poor of Christ's Hospital in London and to the poor of his own parish (St. Sepulchre's). He also makes bequests to his servant Nicholas Byfonte, his maidservant Alice Harris, and his cousin Epham Westis, wife of Thomas Westis. As overseers, he designates Mathew Marten and one Mattingley; witnesses to the will included Mathew Marten, George Needler, Richard Cooper, Brian Garvie, and Alice Rolfe (the last two signing by marks). Catherine Gonneld (through a notary public) probated the will on 10 December 1594. Gonneld's son Benjamin (also called Gunnell and Goonald) matriculated at Cambridge from St. John's College in 1581, received his B.A. in 1584/5 and his M.A. in 1588, and was vicar of Takeley, Essex, from 1598 until his death in 1629. 5 The Stationers' Register records payments to him from 1586 to 1595, including money for delivering sermons before the Company. On 26 June 1589, he was admitted to the freedom of the Company, " per patrimonium " (Arber, I, 514, 519, 525, 533, 554, 566, 575; II, 705).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stephen Kevall Duff (p. 86) summarizes Kevall's activities as a stationer from 1535 to 1571, primarily as an official of the Stationers' Company, of which he was a charter member in 1557. Numerous references to him occur in the Stationers' Register in his official capacity. Duff notes that he died on 13 April 1571, and Plomer (pp. 18-19) prints an abstract of his will (supposedly dated 28 October 1570), as probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 20 April 1571. The parish registers of St. Mary at Hill record the burial of "Stephe [sic] Kevall" on 17 April 1571 (Guildhall Library MS. 4546). Another copy of his will, this one dated 20 October 1570, was probated in the Archdeaconry Court of London by his widow Jane on 24 October 1572 (Guildhall Library MS. 9051/4, fol. 20 v ). The content of this will is the same as that in Plomer (from P.R.O., Prob. 11. 53/Holney 17). The following names from the will are in addition to those in Plomer: Alice, wife of Hugh Woodcock, citizen and salter of London; Stephen, son of John Adiann, citizen and fishmonger of London; and Israhell, son of John Portlet, butcher of Newbury. Duff (p. 86) says that Jane Kevall died in 1573, but this information derives from Plomer's statement (p. 19) that Kevall's bequest to the Stationers' Company "did not come into the hands of the Company till the death of Jane Kevall, the widow, in 1573." The registers of St. Mary at Hill in fact record the burial of "Ianee Kevall widdow" on 14 July 1580 (Guildhall Library MS. 4546). On 22 March 1575/6, "Iane Kevall of London widowe, beinge at this presente in healthe of bodye," made her will, in which she asks "to be buryed within the p ar rishe church of saincte Marye at Hill in London, wheare I am a parishion er . . . nere the place where my late husbande Stephen Kevall lieth buried" (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 63/Darcy 25). Among her bequests is 20 s. for a repast to the Livery of the Stationers' Company in London for accompanying her corpse to burial. As sole executrix, she names her cousin Alice Woodcock, wife of Hugh Woodcock, salter. She adds that she has devised to the Stationers' Company a message that her husband had purchased from William Kelley (and that Stephen Kevall had mentioned in his own will). Through a notary public, Alice Woodcock probated the will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 13 June 1581.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Simon Martynson Martynson was a stationer who flourished in London between 1535 and 1538. Duff (pp. 101, 174) thinks that he may be the servant "Simon" to whom Wynkyn De Worde made a bequest in his will of 1534. Martynson did not die until 1552, when his will was probated in the Archdeaconry Court of London (Guildhall Library MS. 9051/2, fol. 66 v ). On 24 July 1552, he described himself in the document as "Symon n Martynson n of the parryshe of saincte magnus Stacyoner sycke in bodye" (the extant parish registers of St. Magnus Martyr begin in 1560). He leaves £3. 6 s. 8 d. to his kinswoman Mary Jacobbe on the day of her marriage, and the residue of his estate to his wife Agnes, whom he names sole executrix. Witnesses to the will were George Myllman, leatherseller, and John Leavyn, tallowchandler. Martynson's widow probated the will on 18 October 1552.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry Middleton McKerrow (p. 192) summarizes Middleton's career as a printer in London between 1567 and 1587, when his shop was in St. Dunstan's Churchyard. Numerous references to him occur in the Stationers' Register. The parish registers of St. Dunstan's in the West record his burial on 9 September 1587: "Henrye Midleton n buryed" (Guildhall Library MS. 10,342). On 6 September 1587, "Henrye Middleton citizen and stationer of London beinge sicke in bodie" made his nuncupative will (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 71/Spencer 53), 6 in which he divides his estate (after payment of debts) into three parts: one-third for his wife Jane, one-third for his children (unnamed), and one-third for other relatives (the residue falling to his wife Jane, whom he names sole executrix). He leaves £20 to his brother-in-law John Danwood, gentleman, for the use and relief of the wife (apparently Middleton's blood sister) of Garratte Heathe, goldsmith (this £20 to be paid out of debts owing to Middleton before he married Jane). He bequeaths £10 to Danwood's wife (apparently also Middleton's blood sister), as well as £8 to Elizabeth Stacye (or Stacie), the eldest daughter of Danwood's wife by her late husband Robert Stacye. Witnesses to the will were John Danwood, Richard Peacock, and William Benedick. Through a notary public, Jane Middleton probated the will on 13 September 1587.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomas Petyt Petyt is known to have been a printer in St. Paul's Churchyard between 1536 (STC 16795) and 1561 (STC 12106), but another book printed by him (STC 11392) may date as early as 1530. Duff (p. 120) notes his imprisonment in 1543 for printing unlawful books. Petyt's 1547 edition of Dean Richard Smith's Brief Treatise Setting Forth Divers Truths (STC 22818) appears in a list of unlawful books found in John Stowe's study in 1568/9 (Arber, I, 394). According to Petyt's will, dated 18 May 1565, he was a member of the Drapers' Company; he describes himself in the document as "Thomas Petyt Citizen and drap er of London beinge sicke of bodie" (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 48/Crymes 4) 7 and leaves to his wife Joane his property in the parishes of Greenstead and Stanford Rivers, Essex. He bequeaths a silver pot and spoon to his kinswoman Agnes Vincent (wife of one Vincent) in the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, and a similar gift to Alice Birde (wife of one Birde) of London. He leaves to the wife of the London stationer Ryddall (i.e., William Riddell) a little silver pot parcel gilt with Roman letters about the midst of it, together with a spoon with a maidenhead. He makes additional silver-pot-and-spoon bequests to four of his wife's daughters by a previous marriage: Marie Wood (or Wodd), Margaret Wood, Dennys Wood, and Elizabeth. He gives a featherbed to his godson John Marchall of Greenstead, Essex, and makes a further bequest to William Wood, his wife's son-in-law (i.e., step-son). Petyt mentions at least five other stationers (besides Riddell) in his will: his kinsman Anthony Kydson (i.e., Kitson), Abraham Veale (to whom a goblet parcel gilt), John Wight (to whom his best furred gown and damask cassock), John Cawood (to whom his lesser hoop of gold), and Thomas Wight (John's son and Petyt's godson, who was to publish from 1590 to 1608). 8 Other persons mentioned in the will are his wife's son John Wood, William Bull, Steaven Tenaunte (the Lord Treasurer's chaplain), his servant Margaret White, and Thomas Vincent (son of Vincent of Sheppey). He forgives his old tenant Benton part payment of debts due. Petyt notes that he receives 10 s. annually out of certain property in Stanford Rivers that he purchased from King Edward VI, 20 s. of which (two years' rent) is to go toward repairing the steeple of Greenstead. He leaves money to the poor of Greenstead and Stanford Rivers, and bequeaths the residue of his estate to his wife Johane (Joane) Pettit, whom he names sole executrix. He designates Gefferey Finche of Greenstead as supervisor of the will, which was witnessed by Thomas Fynche, John Tymon(d), Anthony Pepper (all three of Stanford Rivers), Robert Shingleton alias Le, and Thomas Alsopp. His widow Joanne Petyt probated the will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 13 February 1565/6.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip Scapulis Scapulis was a member of the Stationers' Company before the charter of 1557; in February 1555/6, he was assessed 6 d. for Bridewell (Arber, I, 48). Duff (p. 143) cites his will, which was probated in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury in 1590, but quotes only Scapulis' identification from the published index to P.C.C. wills. In the document itself, dated 9 August 1589, he describes himself as "Philipp Scapulis Stacyoner borne in Germany in the Auncyent Cittie of Trier and dwellinge in Brustoe [i.e., Bristol, Gloucestershire] in England in Wyne Streate in the parishe of the holie trinitye" (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 75/Drury 36; the will is signed "By me Phillipp Scapulis [m er chant deleted ] stacion er of Bristowe"). He asks "to be buryed . . . in the parishe churche of the holie Trinitye before the pewe wherein I was wont to kneele." He makes a number of ten-shilling bequests: to John Ball, a poor cripple; to John Tanye, bowyer, and his wife; to a poor, lame man named Hewes, one of the almsmen of the Almshouse within Lawfourdes gate, 9 and Anne his wife; to poor Goodwife Gere, who dwelt with him in London and nourished him as a child and who was now living in Bristol; to Robert Goodyere, smith, and Margaret his wife, in St. Peter's parish; to the poor prisoners in Newgate (5 s. in bread); to old Richard Rudge, shoemaker; to old John Faye, grocer, dwelling upon the Bridge; to fifty poor men or women that are known to be true protestants (6 d. each); to George Brumley, gardener, and his wife; to the wife of Goodman Risse, deceased, formerly a shearman dwelling in Temple Street (5 s. to his wife, then in one of the Almshouses within Lawfordes Gate); to the two maids then living with him (Alice and Elizabeth Yeomans); and to poor old Goodwife Ellen, living in the Almshouse on Michellhill. He leaves the residue of his estate to his wife Elizabeth, whom he names sole executrix. As overseers, he names his cousin Thomas Tyler, hooper, dwelling in Ballance Street, and his friend Hugh Harvey, schoolmaster and scrivener. He mentions three godsons: Philip, son of Thomas the gardener; Philip, son of Lewes Taylor; and Philip, son of Anthony Symons, tailor, deceased. Other bequests are to his cousin Thomas Tyler's kinswoman Margaret, who has come to dwell with Scapulis and his wife; the parson, Master Jones; and the poor widow of Amkoras Knight, pointmaker, dwelling in Leons Meade. The most interesting bequest is to Richard Fourde, stationer, of Bristol, who was formerly Scapulis' apprentice and who is mentioned as owing Scapulis some money: "I do giue vnto Richard ffourde stacyoner which was sometymes my prentise my great presses which standethe in my garden and my three mouldes made of latten wyer to make paste bordes withall. And I doe giue hym all my cording Bourdes which hange vppon strings in my workinge chaumber." He leaves to his neighbor Nicholas Wolfe, cutler, his longest riding sword, and to his cousin Henry Nayler his other long riding sword. The will, which Scapulis says he wrote on both sides of a lease, was not witnessed until 20 February 1589/90, by Henry Nayler and Richard Fourde. Through a notary public, Elizabeth Scapulis probated the will on 21 May 1590.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Sysaye (Sysaie) "Robert Sysay" was a member of the Stationers' Company before the charter of 1557, and references to him occur between 1559 and 1562. In 1558—59, he presented "Thomas Sysay" to be apprenticed for seven years, and on 1 November 1561 Nicholas Smith for ten years. He was fined 6 d. for nonattendance on 13 January 1561/2 (Duff, p. 155; Arber I, 98, 169, 184). In his will of 8 September 1563, "Roberte Sysaye in the parrishe of sainte botholf w it hout Allgate London stacioner" requests burial "in the churche yeard of sainte Butholfes aforesaid or elles where" (Guildhall Library MS. 9051/3, fols. 34 v -35). The parish registers of St. Botolph's, Aldgate, record the burial of "Roberte Scissor" on 24 October 1563 (Guildhall Library MS. 9222/1). His will provides for money for the poor-men's boxes of St. Botolph's, Aldgate, and of the township of Conisholme, Lincolnshire, where he was born. He identifies Thomas Sysaie, son of John Sysaie, as his apprentice, to whom he gives one year of his apprenticeship and, at the conclusion thereof, his marble riding coat; his best hat; his sword, dagger, and sword girdle; his saddle and bridle; the fur and lining that was in his nightgown; and his best cloak. To his brother Nycolas Sysaie of Ludney, Lincolnshire, he gives his best riding coat, his worst cloak, and plain black hose. He leaves to his brother Raffe Sysaie of Conisholme all his empty barrels remaining there; Raffe's wife is to receive one silver ring double gilt, worth 2 s. 6 d . Sysaye mentions three children (Robert, Mary, and "Eamm"—apparently Emma), who are all unmarried and under twenty, and his wife Margaret, whom he names sole executrix. As supervisors of the will, he names James Gonneld, stationer (see Duff, pp. 57-58, and the section above on Gonneld), and Henry Woodcock, bowyer (Woodcock is to get either Sysaye's copy of Fabian's Chronicle or 3 s. 4 d. ). He acknowledges certain debts to Gonneld, as well as to John Wadd, sadler, and provides for his apprentice, Thomas Sysaye, to have the lease of the house in which he (Robert Sysaye) dwells, in the event of his wife and children's decease before her remarriage. Sysaye concludes by noting that he wrote the will with his own hand; it was witnessed by James Ryland, minister of St. Botolph's, Aldgate. Margaret Sysaye probated the will in the Archdeaconry Court of London on 12 November 1563. Sysaye's apprentice, Thomas Sysaye, apparently died shortly thereafter, if he is the "Thomas Scissor" who was buried at St. Botolph's, Aldgate, on 17 November 1563 (Guildhall Library MS. 9222/1). A note in the parish register indicates that the plague began in July 1563 and subsided by January 1563/4, so that perhaps both Robert and Thomas Sysaye were numbered among its victims.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Taverner An entry in the accounts of Henry VIII for April 1521 records a payment to John Taverner, a London stationer, "for binding, clasping and covering 41 books for the King's chapel" (Duff, p. 156). Duff cites Taverner's will, but gives only its date and the date of probate, apparently from Arber. 10 In his will of 27 November 1529, "Iohn Tauerner cytizin and Stacioner of london n " asks that his "sinfull body be buryed in the chapell of saint Anne and saint Thomas the martir within pardon churche yarde of the cathederall churche of saint paule of london n in the south side of the same chapell vnder the new tombe there whiche I haue made to my costes and charges" (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 24/Thower 11). He divides his estate into three parts: one-third for his wife Anne, one-third for his son Nicholas and daughter Margaret, and one-third for miscellaneous bequests. He leaves 6 s. 8 d. to the high altar of his parish church of St. Faith's and £20 for his funeral (including £6 for the poor). He also makes bequests to the parish churches of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex (where he was born), and of Takeley (also in Essex). Other London parish churches that he remembers are those of St. Michael le Querne and St. Gregory's beside Paul's. He leaves 10 s. to the Blackfriars and Greyfriars, provided they are present at his burial. Taverner mentions his mother as still living, and he seems to have had a brother named John Taverner—which is unusual, though not impossible; perhaps he was a half-brother by an earlier or later marriage of his father's. He remembers this brother John and his wife and sons John and Thomas, as well as his brother Henry Taverner and wife, who also have a son named Nicholas. Others mentioned in the will are Nicholas Clerke and his wife, Henry Clerke and his sister, Robert Austen of Aldgate, John Tourner, Thomas Symon, the priests David Owen and William Rayne, Taverner's kinsman John Stonard and his wife, Master Curleis, and Master Welles. He leaves five marks to his apprentice William Wallys, when he comes out of his apprenticehood, and a black gown to his apprentice Roger. He also leaves 6 s. 8 d. to the Stationers' Company, and he bequeaths the residue of his estate to his wife Anne and son Nicholas, whom he names his executors. As overseers, he nominates Master Doctor Bright and John Clampart, citizen and haberdasher of London. Among the witnesses to the will were Master Sharnbroke, Sir Richard Sill, Richard Dalcoy, sir David Owen junior (the priest), and Master William Falke. Anne and Nicholas Taverner probated the will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 30 November 1531. Anne Taverner died six years later. On 3 December 1537, "Anne Tavern er widowe, of the p ar ishe of Sainct ffeith in the Cytie of London late the wife of Iohn Taverner Citizen and Stacioner of London n decesid" made her will, at a time when she was "sicke in body" (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 27/Dyngeley 12). She asks "to be buried in the Chappell of sainct Anne in p ar don churche yarde next vnto the Cathedrall churche of sainct Paule in London n where my saide late husband lyith buried in the chappell of sainct Anne." She leaves 6 s. 8 d. to the high altar of her parish of St. Faith's, and 5 s. to the brotherhood of "pappy" (presumably priests) to be at her burial. She bequeaths 3 s. 4 d. to the company of clerks, and 10 s. each to the Blackfriars and Whitefriars. She leaves one black gown each to her son Nicholas Taverner and his wife Mary. Also remembered are her son-in-law William Bull and Margaret his wife (Anne Taverner's daughter); her brother Harry's wife of Writtle, Essex, and the latter's daughter Agnes; Mrs. Bollter; Hickman's wife and son; Henry Clerke's wife and their children; and Joane, late her servant, now dwelling in Chancery Lane. She leaves the residue of her estate to her son Nicholas, whom she names her executor. Nicholas Taverner probated the will on 12 December 1537 in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Nicholas and his wife Mary are mentioned in a deed of March 1538, and his name appears in the Stationers' Company's charter of 1557 (Duff, p. 156).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Randall Tyrer Duff (p. 156) states three facts about "Randall Tirer": (1) he was imprisoned in October 1554, according to Foxe, for selling books sent to England by Marian exiles; (2) he was an original member of the Stationers' Company; and (3) he died in "1558/9." On 13 October 1556, Tyrer presented Henry Croker and John Bradeshawe as his apprentices. The Stationers' Register records assessments of, contributions from, and fines for him between 1555 and 1558, the latest being a fine of 4 d. "for byndynge of mediante bokes in shepes lether." Duff's dating of Tyrer's death derives from an entry between 10 July 1558 and 10 July 1559 concerning the payment of 12 d. "ffor occupynge of the herse clothe for Randall Tyerer" (Arber, I, 40, 47, 49, 50, 69, 100, 102). In fact, Tyrer died in late March or early April 1559, when his will was probated in the Archdeaconry Court of London (Guildhall Library MS. 9051/2, fol. 269 rv ; Tyrer's Christian name appears as "Randalph" in the margin of the register book). In the document, dated 25 March 1559, "Randall Tyrer Stacioner of london being sick of bodye" asks that he "be buried . . . within the p ar rishe churche of Saynt Michaell in the Qwerne in london" (the parish registers of St. Michael le Querne are lost before 1685/6). He leaves 10 s. each to his brothers Hvon Tyrer, Percivall, and Thomas, and to his sisters Sibble, Margaret (dwelling in Warwick), and Jane. He bequeaths 40 s. each to his apprentices, Harry Croker and William Spier, upon completion of their respective apprenticeships, and he asks that they be true and faithful servants to his wife Elizabeth, to whom he leaves the residue of his estate and whom he names sole executrix. James Burrell and Richard Handford witnessed the will, which Elizabeth Tyrer probated on 9 April 1559.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dunstan Whaplod This stationer, whose surname appears in a number of spellings (Whaplane, Whaplade, Whaplett, Whapplodd), flourished in London between 1566 and 1577 and was apparently a member of the Stationers' Company before the charter of 1557 (Duff, p. 168). In 1566-67, he was licensed to publish The Epitaph of Sir Martin Bowes (Arber, I, 329). On 14 June 1571, "Dunston Waplod and Joan Sutton" were married by license at St. Mary Woolnoth; she was presumably the widow of "Edwarde Sutton, Stacioner ," who was buried there on 30 January 1568/9. 11 William Kynge, formerly apprenticed to Joan Sutton, was transferred to Whaplod on 14 January 1576/7, and Whaplod was fined 12 d. on 13 January 1578/9 for failing to attend on the Lord Mayor seven days before (Arber, II, 673, 849). On 5 April 1582, "Dunstane Whaplett of the p ar rishe of saincte Olave in the Borowghe of Sowthwark in the countie of Surreye, beinge sicke in bodye," made his nuncupative will, in which he leaves all of his goods to his wife Jone Whaplett, whom he names sole executrix (P.R.O., Prob. 11. 64/Tirwhite 14). One witness to the will was Christopher Style, preacher of St. Olave's, Southwark. Joanne Whaplett probated the will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 21 April 1582. Then, on 9 September 1583, "Thomas Goffe, of the Parish of St. Olaves, in Southwark, and Johan Whaplett, Wydow ," of St. Mary Woolnoth, were married by license at the latter church ( Registers . . . of S. Mary Woolnoth . . . , p. 129).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Foul Papers, Compositor B, and the Speech-Prefixes Of All's Well that Ends Well by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About All's Well that Ends Well Sir Walter Greg wrote, "There can, of course, be no doubt that behind F lie the author's foul papers." 1 This conclusion was based in some part on the preservation of what Greg took to be authorial stage-directions and even of a memorandum like ' Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commenting of this wedding ' (I.iii [TLN 1089-90]), various inadequate entrance directions and numerous omitted exits, but chiefly the wide variety of designations in the speech-prefixes for the Countess, Bertram, the two French Lords, and in part for Lafeu. Greg considered but rejected the possibility that some intermediary agent might have come between Jaggard's compositors and Shakespeare's holograph papers. He remarked, it is true, that "Some long dashes in the printed text and some broken lines suggest cuts or alterations, and in occasional inconsequences and contradictions and in imperfectly assimilated chunks of prose it is easy to find evidence of botching. No Shakespearian spellings have been noted and the text is in worse form than we should expect from Jaggard's compositors working on an autograph manuscript." 2 He concluded: "It has been conjectured that the foul papers had been transcribed by a rather incompetent literary scribe—anyone connected with the theatre must have done more to tidy them up—and if so it might be possible to blame him for some sententious fustian. But what such a transcript could have been doing among the playhouse manuscripts is unexplained." 3 Obviously Greg is right that Shakespeare's foul papers lie behind this play. Whether they were holograph or had been literally transcribed is basically undemonstrable but the available evidence suggests strongly that the play was set direct from a manuscript in Shakespeare's autograph. J. Dover Wilson's evidence in the New Cambridge edition (pp. 103 ff.) for transcription is as faulty as his evidence for a late revision of an early play by another hand, and it can be safely disregarded. In every respect the textual difficulties and anomalies are consistent with those to be expected from compositors tackling a manuscript that could be called 'working papers.' The manuscript contained at least one revised passage, several additions, and very likely a quantity of verbal alteration whether during or after inscription. All evidence that can be reconstructed for non-prompt theatrical transcripts such as lie behind the Folio texts of Julius Caesar and Twelfth Night , for example, indicates that they were designed to normalize just such irregularities as the highly variable forms of speech-prefixes that are preserved in All's Well . 4 That anything approaching 'Shakespearian spellings' are hidden by the overlaid texture of the three Folio compositors is not surprising as late as 1623. It is easier to believe in the concealment of Shakespeare's orthographical characteristics (whatever they were) by compositorial styling of an old-fashioned manuscript than to posit a highly unusual form of literal non-theatrical transcript made for an unknown purpose and utilized by the theatrical editors as printer's copy for the Folio. Later opinion as illustrated by G. K. Hunter, for example (New Arden edition [1959], pp. xi-xiv), takes it—correctly in the opinion of the present writer—that Shakespeare's own foul papers served Jaggard as the printer's copy. In addition to the now discarded hypothesis of a scribal transcript, the shadow of a book-keeper's markings interfering with the text, possibly in a serious manner, has hung over this play. Sir Edmund Chambers thought that "the book-keeper has possibly added the letters G. and E. to the 1. and 2. by which the author discriminated the brothers Dumain, who are indifferently described . . . as Lords, Captains, or Frenchmen, and are apparently also the Gentlemen of iii.2. The Letters may indicate the names of actors; Gough and Ecclestone have been guessed at." 5 Again, G. K. Hunter analyzing the evidence points out the weaknesses of the hypothesis for intervention and argues plausibly that the initials are Shakespeare's own means of identification. 6 The old-fashioned idea that a book-keeper would annotate Shakespeare's foul papers and cut them in preparation for direct transcription into a prompt-book is inherently improbable for plays of this, or perhaps any date, instead of working over a clean intermediate transcript made for the purpose; moreover, the evidence for cutting and other such preparation is weak in the extreme. However, it seems likely that the manuscript received a minimal 'editing' for publication. If Jaggard's copy was indeed the working papers, as seems to be assured, it is not certain that the act division would have been written in by Shakespeare. Since a compositorial division of the acts, given the order of printing the pages, is quite impossible to argue for, the implication follows that whoever prepared the copy for Jaggard probably inserted the notation, at least for Acts II-V. If so, it is theoretically possible that the theatrical directions for flourishes at the King's entries and exits were also additions, and just possibly the directions for a tucket in II.v and alarums in IV.i as well, although there is nothing inherently improbable in attributing them all to Shakespeare. To sum up, one can dismiss with considerable confidence suggestions that the text itself has been interfered with in any significant manner by an outside agent, barring always the normal compositorial sophistication and corruption that accompanies the transmission of an early seventeenth-century text from manuscript to print, exacerbated in this play to some extent by more than usual difficulties with the handwriting but relieved of the secret and undetectable departures from copy of a scribal intermediary. As indicative of working papers, the stage-directions betray the author's hand not only in their occasional descriptive cast, despite their generally businesslike nature, but also in their failure always to agree with the text. Description is present in the much-discussed 'memorandum' in II.iii Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commenting of this wedding (1089-90) 7 and in such directions as II.i (594-596) Enter the King with divers yong Lords, taking leave for the Florentine warre . . ., the odd III.vi (1730-31) Enter Count Rossillion and the Frenchmen, as at first , 8 or IV.ii (2016-17) Enter Bertram and the Maide called Diana . 9 Some directions are precise about minor persons, such as V.i (2592-93) Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana, with two Attendants , but some are vague about characters who would need to be specified in the prompt-book, as the divers Attendants in I.ii and the divers young Lords in II.i, both of which include the two speaking parts of Lords G and E. The number of attendants may be permissively given: IV.i (1911-12) Enter one of the Frenchmen, with five or sixe other souldiers in ambush , a direction that also fails to specify Lord E as the Frenchman. Only two of the five or sixe souldiers have speaking parts. A similar direction occurs at IV.iii (2106-7) Enter the two French Captaines, and some two or three Souldiours . Various directions do not agree with the text and would need to be set right in any preparation of the prompt-book. In II.iii (944) the direction reads Enter 3 or 4 Lords , but the following dialogue requires four lords for Helena to pass over before she chooses Bertram. According to a possible interpretation of Helena's 'Where are my other men?' in II.iv (1366), the Clown or some other attendant should have been designated as entering with her at 1325 although she alone is mentioned. 10 The familiar difficulty of the direction in III.i (1446-47) Enter Hellen and two Gentlemen when these are in facts Lords G and E (assigned the speech-prefixes French G. and French E. ) needs no remark here. In IV.iii (2181) the text reads Enter a Messenger , but this is Bertram's servant who had accompanied him from Paris to Florence (1491-92, and the prefix Ser. at 2183) and he has no function as a messenger. In V.iii (2876) Parolles is listed in the entrance direction with the Widow and Diana but he does not in fact appear until his properly noted entrance at 2960. At least sixteen exits are not marked, only four of these at the ends of scenes where the omission is of no great concern. No directions are present for the staging of II.i in which the King seems to withdraw apart at 621 and come forward again at 661. These are all matters that indicate working papers, not a text in any way prepared for acting. Various internal inconsistencies exist that might or might not have been adjusted on review. The time scheme by no means permits Helena to have arrived in Florence on her way to Saint Jacques, to have performed the bed trick that very night, but on the same night to be reported dead at Saint Jacques as testified by the Rector's report. Lords G and E arrived in Florence in III.i and in III.ii appear in Rousillon on their way back to Florence from a visit to Paris. In Rousillon they receive a letter from the Countess to Bertram. Inexplicably the letter is not delivered when they meet Bertram in Florence and plan the exposure of Parolles; and this letter is in fact not mentioned as delivered until IV.iii (2108-11) and then on some vague occasion difficult to reconstruct. It is at least arguable that the gentle Astringer in V.i (2601) to whom Helena delivers a letter to the King disappears from the plot thereafter, for it is reasonably clear that the Gentleman in V.iii who delivers Diana's petition to the King at 2842 is not he, and this petition seems to have taken the place of Helena's letter which so far as we know is never received by the King. In V.iii (2924-25) the King speaks to Diana, 'Me thought you saide | You saw one heere in Court could witnesse it' (her intimacy with Bertram), to which Diana responds, 'I did my Lord'; but she has said nothing of the sort. 11 Whether or not these anomalies would have been worked over before production—and they are no more than the normal Shakespearean carelessnesses also observable in plays in copy more highly developed for the theater—the directions would have needed sharpening, correction, and addition for acting, and the faulty speech-prefixes at 615, 2190, 2233, and between 2227 and 2384 (perhaps even to 2417 in the manuscript) would have required correction. And Helen's broken speech at 169 might have been observed and a transition introduced. The variable speech-prefixes constitute the chief evidence, perhaps, for the belief that All's Well that Ends Well was set from Shakespeare's working papers. Bertram's prefixes may be forms of Rossillion or of Bertram , and once he is Count . The Countess may be Mother , Countess , Old Countess , Lady , or Old Lady . Lafeu is generally Lafew but in II.i he starts as Lord Lafew though then changing to Lafew ; and in III.iii he is Old Lafew , once Old Lord (perhaps a misreading of an abbreviation for Old Lafew ), but before the end of the scene he has reverted to Lafew . The two French Lords lead a varied existence: they may be Lord G and Lord E, 1. Lord G and 2. Lord E, French G and French E , as well as Captain G and Captain E . At 1466 1. G. is more likely an artifact prefix referring back to the stage-direction identifying them as two Gentlemen despite the fact that before and after 1466 they are prefixed as French G and French E and so 1. G. could just possibly have been a misprint for Fr. G . At 2233 Cap. is intended for Cap. G in terms of the erroneous reversed prefixes that had started shortly before. McKerrow suggested that in Romeo and Juliet a case could be made for some variation in prefixes to derive from the function of a character in a given scene: for example, Lady Capulet could be Mother in relation to Juliet, Wife in relation to her husband, and Lady Capulet as mistress of her household. 12 But in All's Well Shakespeare's variety of nomenclature both within stage-directions and speech-prefixes seems to have resulted more from writing the scenes at different times than from any immediate association of the descriptive prefix with the function of the character. It is true, however, that the First Soldier's prefix changes within IV.1 to Interpreter as he assumes his new function and that in III.vi, IV.i, IV.iii (but not in III.i) the two French Lords in their military capacity become Captain G and Captain E though reverting to Lords in V.ii back at court. It is also true that in I.i the Countess for the only time is Mother in direction and in prefixes, reflecting her chief function in the scene in relation to Bertram. But later there is nothing in the scenes in which she appears as Lady or as Old Lady to warrant any functional difference from the usual Countesse ; nor indeed do any of Lafeu's functions account for his variations between Lafew , Lord Lafew , and Old Lafew . The best case, then, is for the Countess as Mother in the opening scene. What might seem to be an even stronger case for the shift of the Frenchmen to Captain is made slightly uncertain, perhaps, by some question whether originally Shakespeare had intended these military characters to be the two Lords. Any study of the compositorial treatment of speech-prefixes with a view to determining what specific forms, or variations, of prefixes were present in the manuscript copy, and what were compositorial and without authority, must take account of two somewhat associated guidelines. The first is that one may assume (other evidence wanting) that a dramatist wrote his working papers in a generally seriatim order of scenes, or if the manuscript were not holograph that a scribe would certainly copy the sheets in order. Thus authorial forms and variations in prefixes should be roughly chronological in their positions. However, when the Folio compositors came to work on a play, owing to their habit of setting a quire from the inside out, the order of composing the Folio pages might differ widely from the seriatim order of the manuscript sheets. It follows that the compositorial treatment of the prefixes must be traced by following the order of typesetting, not that of authorial progression. The second caveat for an inquiry is that some attention must be paid (in connection with the order of setting) to the possibility that (a) the form of a character's name in a preceding stage-direction might influence a compositor to desert the form of his manuscript copy, and (b) eventual familiarity with a character could lead a compositor to adopt a standard form of prefix without regard for what he found in his copy. That compositors (including Compositor B) could be influenced by copy even in minor matters of the abbreviation of prefixes was demonstrated some years ago by Professor Brents Stirling, who most ingeniously identified not only the revised section of the duplicate announcement of Portia's death in Julius Caesar IV.iii but also a revised section, or addition, in the conspirators' first conference in II.i with Brutus. 13 His evidence was exact. Throughout the play both Compositors A and B invariably held to the expanded prefix Cassi. for Cassius. But in these two sections the form changes to Cass. for Compositor A and Cas. for Compositor B. The inevitable inference is that the standard form of prefix in the underlying scribal manuscript had been carefully chosen as Cassi. in order to distinguish him from Cœs. (readily confused with Cas. ) and from Cask. for Casca, but that the revised parts of the manuscript in a different hand more carelessly read Cas. or Cass . 14 and that this shorter form was faithfully followed by the two compositors. The bibliographical evidence based on the order of typesetting is the same as that which proves useful in All's Well . The first page of Julius Caesar that Compositor A set was sig. kk3 v in which at TLN 711 Cassius by name heads a group entrance and, speaking immediately at 713, is given the prefix Cass. , this proving to be the revised section of the manuscript. Compositor A then went back one page in the cast-off copy and set kk3 r , the end of Act I, in which he encountered a character not named in any direction and hence unidentifiable but with a copy-prefix that he set as Cassi. from the regular manuscript. That Compositor A followed copy in this distinction is clear; that he did so because under the circumstances he could not know whether this character in I.iii was the same as that on the page of II.i he had set just before, prefixed Cass. , is certainly probable. Compositor B worked on sig. kk4 r while A was setting kk3 v , this also being B's first introduction to the play. No entrance for Cassius is on this page; hence B must have followed copy Cas. or Cass. when he set Cass. as the prefix in text that continued II.i after A's catchword on kk3 v . Hence in copy taken to be in the same revised form as A's, B set the same shorter form of the prefix. When in his order of setting B next encountered Cassius it was in III.i on kk5 v where Cassius is part of a group entrance opening the scene and speaks first a dozen lines later, at 1215, where he is Cassi. and so continues until the second revision in the play in IV.iii. In this latter scene the explanation of strangeness, as in II.i, will not work, for B set sig. ll3 v (within IV.iii) with the prefix Cassi. , continued with the same tag on ll4 r (which also began V.i), and on ll4 v . He next set ll3 r . In the first column the regular prefix is Cassi , but after the entrance of the Poet (2108) a few lines down in column b the first prefix in the column shifts to Cas. ( Cass. once at 2159), this text containing the revised version of the announcement of Portia's death. When on ll3 v (set earlier) the regular form of the manuscript returns, containing the undeleted second announcement, the prefix is the usual Cassi. always set from this manuscript. Between the two columns on ll3 r no question could have arisen in B's mind that he was dealing with a different character from the familiar Cassius. Hence at this point B must have followed copy in the shorter form of the prefix, influenced by the variant form in a part of the manuscript written in a different hand even though this meant his abandoning the established Cassi. prefix. On kk3 v -4 r the fidelity in both compositors is readily explained by the strangeness of the character and the copy-prefix at the start of typesetting, but not on ll3 r apparently. This example illustrates that Compositor B—at least on the evidence of Julius Caesar —may be studied in All's Well with some general confidence that he would not be likely to go against copy except perhaps in mechanical matters of abbreviation to justify a line or, possibly, in the establishment of a favorite short form of the same prefix instead of a longer form. Evidence for compositorial fidelity to copy may be found, in fact, on the various occasions when the speech-prefixes of All's Well exhibit independence from the forms found in the preceding stage-directions. In II.i the entrance direction reads Enter Lafew but the prefix in the very next line (662) is L. Laf. and again two lines later (664). When Compositor C at the head of the next column then shifts to the formula Laf. , which he maintains for the rest of the scene, the normal conjecture is not that his copy changed (although this is quite possible) but that he preferred the short form of the prefix when no ambiguity was present. 15 However, the essential point here is that his initially set prefixes did not agree with the immediately preceding direction. Similarly, at II.ii the direction is Enter Countesse and Clowne but in the first speech Compositor C set the prefix Lady which he followed six more times plus the catchword on V4 v . When after setting three other Folio pages Compositor B came to set V5, he also chose the prefix La. , presumably under the influence of the copy catchword marked as such in the manuscript. 16 The direction heading II.iii on V5 reads Enter Count, Lafew, and Parolles but B set the opening speech with the tag Ol. Laf. , a form demonstrably from copy because of the error Ol. Lord at 997 heading V5 v that follows although on a page that had been set earlier. 17 In III.iii the opening direction reads Enter . . . Rossillion but in the fourth line Bertram's prefixes begin with Ber. (1544). So also at III.iv the direction reads Countesse but the prefixes are La. , and in III.vi after the direction Count Rossillion the prefix is Ber . In IV.iii a direction reads, in error, Enter a Messenger (2181) but the single speech of this character is correctly prefixed Ser. for Servant (2183). On at least one observable occasion a compositor (in this case B) was influenced, seemingly, by the preliminary stage-direction to go against what was probably the copy-prefix. In III.ii (sig. X1) the opening direction reads Enter Countesse and Clowne and the initial prefix (1402) is Count. , followed by a second Count. (1406); but beginning with 1422 she is Lad. and so continues in the shortened form La. for the rest of the scene. Because Lady as prefix had already appeared (following Countesse in the direction) in II.ii set by C and continued by B, and was to re-occur in III.iv and IV.v, it may seem possible to take it that Compositor B started by drawing on the direction form as his prefix but shortly reverted to what he saw in his copy. 18 However, Shakespeare's own variation cannot, of course, be completely discarded although as a lesser possibility. The possibility must be examined, also, whether in V.iii the opening direction could have influenced the following speech-prefixes. In this direction on sig. X6 the Countess is old Lady (2695), the same identification that had appeared in a direction in IV.v at 2481 on sig. X5, followed by the speech-prefixes La . On X6 in V.iii after the direction at 2695 she speaks soon after at 2701 and is given the prefix Old La . On X6 v at 2799 (no further direction intervening) and again at 2872 the same prefix appears. At first sight one could take it that the distance is short enough so that the prefix at 2701 could have influenced that at 2799 and that, in turn, have affected 2872. However, between X6 r and X6 v Compositor B had withdrawn from the Folio to set some amount of text in another book, the extent of which is unknown. It is only natural to believe that B would probably not have kept in mind during this interval what in fact was a unique prefix for the Countess. Obviously, it is simpler to conjecture that the reason why B set Old La. when he returned to X6 v after an interval between it and X6 r was that he was following copy. No exception could be taken to this conclusion were it not that the Countess' only remaining speech, which occurs at 2919 in sig. Y1, has the prefix Coun. , which must almost certainly be a copy-form. 19 Whether this variant is an authorial aberration or whether Coun. had been the copy-prefix earlier in the scene on X6 and X6 v , changed by Compositor B, is a question not to be tackled in isolation, for another anomaly in speech-prefixes is present on Y1 in connection with Bertram, and the two may be related. Whether by accident or design, despite the widely varying identifications of Bertram in the stage-directions as Count Rossillion , Rossillion , Count , and Bertram , Compositor B throughout quire X (1375-2913) with but one exception invariably assigns him the prefix Bertram , usually in the form Ber . This decision, if decision it were, 20 might even have been made somewhat earlier, since the common prefix begins, in fact, in II.v (1269-1370) on B's sig. V6 v , where the direction is also Bertram . The history of this prefix is interesting. Printing of the play started with the two simultaneously set pages V3 v (by Compositor D) and V4 (by Compositor C). Bertram does not appear on sig. V3 v except in the stage-direction for II.i where he is confused by D as two characters, ' Count, Rosse ', an error that indicates clearly the form of the abbreviation in the manuscript. Compositor C set twenty-three lines of type on V4 before he came to a speech by Bertram, which he prefixed as Rossill. twice (626, 630) before reducing it to Ross. (649) with one short Ros. in a tight line preceding it (637). Given the form of the manuscript abbreviation Rosse in the direction as interpreted by D when he subsequently came to complete his page V3 v , one may readily conjecture that C's initial two settings of Rossill. could not have derived from the direction (if he had consulted it on the same sheet of manuscript) and hence that they reproduce copy. Bertram does not appear in the two pages of the outer forme set by C and D. When after a delay Compositor B took over the exclusive setting of the play with V2:5 v , he started with V2 but encountered Bertram for the first time on V5 v where there was no stage-direction to give him a clue. Here the prefixes in the dialogue with the King are Ber . It would seem most probable that in these prefixes B was following copy, for he had no other hint as to Bertram's identity except within the text, and that he would change the Ross. prefix in the manuscript (if it had been so written) when he started Bertram's prefixes at 1005 because in 1003 the King had called him Bertram is scarcely credible. Only after completing V5 v did B turn to V2 v where for the first time in B's experience Bertram is so identified in a stage-direction (as Bertram at 262) and is given the prefixes Ber. again. Since Ber. had already occurred without identification on V5 v , there is no reason to take it that B was doing any-thing but following copy on V2 v . In the opening direction for II.iii on the next page V5 the form is Enter Count but the single prefix for Bertram on this page is Ros. (901), again presumably from copy since at this time B had set no text identifying Bertram as Rossillion. When B then carries on with V1 v :6 (1-92, 1124-1249), he sets Ros. throughout I.i on V1 v ; and so on V6 concluding II.iii when Bertram makes his re-entrance as Count Rossillion in the direction (1171) he is Ros. in the succeeding prefixes (1174-1202). When B then begins Ber. as an invariable prefix in II.v on V6 v (1272) after the direction Enter Lafew and Bertram , we have no means of knowing whether the manuscript prefixes continued mixed between Ross. and Ber. thereafter or whether it was Shakespeare, not B, who switched over to Ber. Given this history it is difficult to explain the conflicting evidence in sigs. Y1 and Y1 v (2914-3078) set in seriatim order in formes with pages of Twelfth Night after a considerable delay during which B had set various quires in the Histories. When he came to these pages B would long since have forgotten whatever forms of prefixes he had decided on earlier in the play. The text of Y1 starting with 2914 continues V.iii in mid-speech. On X6 v , as throughout quire X, the sole prefix form had been Ber. with the exception of an aberrant Count. at 2412 on X5 in IV.iii. 21 However, in this continuous text abruptly on Y1 at 2930, followed at 3046 on Y1 v , the prefixes change to Ros. Since Ros. had been one of the two prefixes for Bertram in quire V, the normal inference would be that starting in quire V and continuing in quire X Compositor B had got in the habit of setting Ber. for Bertram regardless of the copy-prefix, which was perhaps a mixture of Ber. and Ross. according to scene. General evidence suggests that when a compositor started to set a new play on $3 v :4, usually well within the text, he was likely to follow the copy-prefixes at least until the characters were established in his mind. If B had behaved in the same manner, on returning as something of a stranger to complete the play after the lapse of several weeks, he also would have been likely to follow copy. This appears to be the only reasonable explanation for the change in prefix from Ber. to Ros. in continuous text but separated into two distinct bibliographical units. 22 The case would be comparatively simple, therefore, were it not for another change in prefix. In this scene V.iii on X6 and X6 v the few speeches by the Countess had been prefixed by Old La. , a descriptive phrase first found in the stage-direction in IV.v on sig. X5 (2481) but followed in the scene by the prefixes La. , and then again in the direction in V.iii (2695) on X6 followed by the prefixes Old La. on X6-6 v . However, her only speech in the next quire comes at 2919 on Y1, where she is Coun. , almost certainly a copy form not only because of its abrupt change but also because B had usually set this prefix as Cou. Reasons have been given above for the conjecture that Old La. was the form of the manuscript prefixes in V.iii on X6 and (after a delay in setting) on X6 v . The difficulty, then, is whether Coun. on Y1 is an authorial variation without significance or whether it aligns itself bibliographically with the shift from Ber. to Ros. 23 in the same pages, even though the corollary would follow that Old La. was in fact not the copy-prefix but that the stage-direction at 2695 had affected B's treatment of copy Coun. 24 In such a dilemma no certainty is possible since all evidence is wanting and only speculation can take its place. The one hard fact is that the prefixes on Y1 must be copy-forms since no consultation seems to have taken place with previously printed sheets. This being so, there are difficulties either in assuming that the shift to Ros. is significant but that to Coun. is not, or that both are significant. One possibility suggests itself which as a speculation would resolve the problem. We know from other evidence that when Shakespeare revised the text, as in I.iii between the entrance of Helena at 450 and the end of the discussion with the Countess about her status as daughter at 512, he could adopt different prefixes: the Countess is Cou. in the original scene but Old Cou. in the revision, for example. Correspondingly, when he left off writing a scene and returned to it at a later time, he might also adopt different prefixes, as conjectured to be the explanation for the shift in prefix from Old Laf. in II.iii to Laf. after the curious memorandum to himself that Shakespeare seems to have written, Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commenting of this wedding (1089-90), marking a break in the writing of the scene. 25 If such a break, or revision, appeared in V.iii, we should have a reason for the shift in speech-prefixes between X6 v and Y1, the difference in the manuscript being preserved by the bibliographical fact of delayed setting of Y1 so that Compositor B was forced to follow copy instead of adopting whatever standard forms he might previously have utilized, as perhaps with Ber. . for a mixture in his copy of Ber. and Ross. On X6 v Ber. as a prefix exists down to the next to last speech on the page (2910), to be replaced at 2930 on Y1 by Ros. However, if we conjecture that the Ber. form is not significant in quire X since B had become used to normalizing any Ross. prefixes in the copy, it is not to Ber. but to the unique Old La. prefix that we must look for possible evidence. At 2869 Bertram is brought back to face the charges in Diana's letter, with the direction Enter Bertram and after the remaining two lines of the King's speech the Countess, with the prefix Old La. calls for justice on those who have harmed Helena (2871). The King in 2873-75 addresses Bertram, breaking off with the demand, 'What woman's that?', followed at 2876 by the direction Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles . This entrance introducing Diana's plea to the King marks the last visible point where Shakespeare could have stopped writing the scene at some natural break in the action and dialogue before the new set of speech-prefixes begins on Y1 in the midst of the give and take of the following speeches. Whether or not it is evidence of a break, this entrance direction at 2876 is in error, for Parolles does not come on the stage with Diana and her mother but instead must be sent for and makes his real entrance only at 2960 on Y1. If in the interval of stopping work before resuming at some later time Shakespeare had jotted the direction, intending Parolles to enter with the two women, but changed his mind when he resumed writing, 26 the error could mark some disruption that would support the speculation that the change to Ros. as a prefix for Bertram marked a manuscript shift at the direction for the continued scene that has been obscured by Compositor B continuing at 2886, 2889, 2899, and 2910 on X6 v after Diana's entrance at 2876 to set the pre-entrance prefix Ber. to the end of the page and his stint, even though in the copy it had shifted to Ross. Conjecturally, therefore, Shakespeare after the entrance at 2876 changed to the prefixes Ross. and Coun. as found on Y1 but the evidence does not reveal itself until the end of the X6 v page and the return of B on Y1 after a period of working on the Histories. If this conjecture is at all plausible, we should have an answer to the anomalous prefixes in continuous dialogue between X6 v and Y1 both for the Countess and for Bertram. We should also have evidence of what has earlier seemed suspicious, the uniformity in quire X of B's use of the Ber. prefix when in quire V good evidence exists that Shakespeare varied between Ross. and Ber. In the order of setting, Lafeu is first encountered on V4, set by Compositor C, where he is L. Laf. twice at the foot of the first column (662, 664) after an entrance as Lafew , but he shifts to Laf. in the second column, more likely a compositorial than an authorial shortening, perhaps. He next appears, in the order of setting, on B's V5 v where at 997 he is Ol. Lord . He does not speak again until 1091 after he has been named Lafew in the memorandum stage-direction at 1089-90, and then he is Laf. for the rest of the page and in all text thereafter. However, as set, after the switch on V5 v from Ol. Laf. ( Ol. Lord is apparently a misreading by B on his first setting of a Lafeu prefix) to Laf. , B went on to V2 v where at 262 Lafeu enters as Lafew but is mute. Sig. V5 follows, in which after the Lafew of the entrance at 892 the first speech at 893 is prefixed Ol. Laf. , this form continuing on the page seventeen more times, the last at 991. Thus when, in the order of the manuscript although not of the setting, Ol. Laf. at 991 is followed by Ol. Lord at 997 on the next page, there can be no doubt of the copy-form in this scene between 893 and 997, especially since Ol. Laf. differs from the immediately preceding direction at 892. 27 However, when he shifts to Laf. later in the scene, signs exist that the difference was present in the copy and that the change at that point is not a case of arbitrary compositorial shortening. Some evidence is present that Shakespeare himself often used the shorter Laf. form as well as Ol. Laf. For instance, on V1 v where B is cautiously following the copy-prefixes on the first page of the play, Lafeu is Laf. (11 ff.) although Lord Lafew in the opening direction. Moreover, the fact that, as in quire X, he remains Laf. in the bibliographically discrete pages Y1 and Y1 v (set after a considerable delay from X) also suggests the copy-form there, especially in connection with the evidence from the prefixes for Bertram and the Countess. Finally, on V6 v the change from Ol. Lord (995) as an indication that copy read Ol. Laf. , to simple Laf. occurs in the continuation of II.iii at 1091 where it is a reasonable conjecture that Shakespeare resumed work on the play only after an interval indicated by the memorandum direction. Hence although B's tendency to shorten prefixes could have operated when Old Laf. alters to invariable Laf. at 1091 for the rest of the play, the general trend of the evidence suggests that it was Shakespeare more than B who was responsible for this change. This is not the place to go into the intricacies of the prefixes for the two French Lords. 28 That the major distinctions in their forms such as 1. Lord G , Lord G , French G , and Captain G are authorial seems practically demonstrable since the stage-directions could have exercised small influence, usually identifying them merely as Frenchmen . It is at least arguable that Shakespeare's first intention was to distinguish them merely as 1. Lord and 2. Lord , for on their introduction in I.ii they are not identified among the divers Attendants (239) although speaking in the scene, nor are they for the second time identified among the divers yong Lords who are taking leave of the King in II.i (594), although again they are speakers. In I.ii on V2 v set by B they are 1. Lo. G and 2. Lo. E except for the slip L. 2. E at 315. In II.i the first and only prefix set by Compositor D, on sig. V3 v , is Lord G for G's first speech. Simultaneously, but setting from a sheet of the manuscript that very likely contained D's first prefix, Compositor C was continuing the scene with V4; in fact, his prefixes would have been set before D came to the start of II.i and G's first speech. Compositor C first set L. G but then 1 Lo. G and 2. Lo. E until in G's last speech (646) he is Lo. G. Both compositors, then, omitted the numerical designation in the initial prefix of their setting under circumstances that should indicate they were following copy both with and without the number, just as B must be assumed to have followed the manuscript in I.ii, set later. The numeral form with initial appears only once more, in the prefix I. Lord E in the first speech of IV.i (1913), uninfluenced by the immediately preceding stage-direction Enter one of the Frenchmen , although in the remainder of the scene he is Lo. E. Whatever the initials G and E signify (names, like George and Edward?), it is at least arguable that they were substitutes invented during the writing of the play for characters who had originally been denominated simply as 1. Lord and 2. Lord , the initials being added irregularly in the early scenes with or without displacement of the numerals. The 1. Lord example in III.i (1378) may be a prefix unaltered by oversight, for afterward in the scene he is Fren. G and E is Fren. E. In III.ii (1466) the anomalous prefix 1. G is less likely to be a misreading of Fr. G , coming as it does after the setting of three prefixes for French E and French G , than a correlation with the opening stage-direction identifying the characters as two Gentlemen (1446) and thus it is perhaps another artifact. There are three occurrences when the compositors copy what appears to be a manuscript repetition of a prefix within the same speech. The first of these is particularly significant because a change in the form of the repeated prefix appears to mark the beginning of a Shakespearean addition which accounts for the repetition. This occurs in I.iii at TLN 451 where after Helena's entrance at 450 the Countess' speech preceding the entrance continues without interruption but with a second prefix, changed in its form to Old Cou. from Cou. at 443, the start of the speech. This marks an addition from 451 (or 450) to 512 before the original text resumes with the prefixes Cou. at 513. 29 However, the second and third examples appear to be related and they are troublesome. In II.ii the Clown has boasted that he has an answer to fit any question, and he begs the Countess to test him: 'Aske mee if I am a Courtier, it shall doe you no harme to learne' (859-860). To this the Countess returns, in a speech prefixed Lady. , 'To be young againe if we could: I will bee a foole in question, hoping to bee the wiser by your answer.' With this speech Compositor C concludes sig. V4 v and his stint in the play. The last word of the speech is divided 'an-|swer.' so that only the second syllable forms the last text-line of the column; then in the line below—the direction-line—C set the speech-prefix Lady. as the catchword. When after a delay in work on the Folio Compositor B took over the typesetting, he set sigs. V2, V5 v , V2 v , and only then came to V5 and the continuation of C's text. The first line on V5 is ' La. I pray you sir, are you a Courtier?' The temptation exists to suggest some bibliographical explanation for this irregularity in what is continuous speech, but one is hard to find. 30 The coincidence of the repeated speech-prefix with the end of a Folio page and a change in compositors seems fortuitous, and there would appear to be every reason to take it that C was faithfully following what he thought to be the intent of his copy, which had two consecutive speeches by the Countess written in order, each prefixed by her tag. This also seems to have been B's understanding when he picked up the copy some days later on sig. V5. Unless one were to speculate that C had marked his manuscript wrongly after instead of before a now lost rejoinder by the Clown, and that B perforce followed the mistaken marking, the catchword ought to indicate that no undeleted rejoinder was present in the manuscript and that the two speeches by the Countess did indeed run consecutively in the final version. Whether revision and the deletion of intervening material caused the repetition of the prefix is an open question. The conjecture that nothing is missing here owing to faulty compositorial marking of copy at the page's end may be strengthened by the parallel case that occurs in II.iv on V6. Here Parolles has been worsted by the Clown in an exchange, and with affected tolerance remarks, 'Go too, thou art a wittie foole, I have found thee.' To this the Clown has two consecutive replies (1243-47) each prefixed by Clo. In the first he enquires, 'Did you finde me in your selfe sir, or were you taught to finde me?' In the second, immediately succeeding and with no intervening reply from Parolles, he adds (with repeated prefix), 'The search sir was profitable, and much Foole may you find in you, even to the worlds pleasure, and the encrease of laughter.' Editorial opinion has tended to conjecture a lost line or so by Parolles between the Clown's two speeches, 31 but the example of the Countess' two speeches does not encourage the hypothesis. The better proposition would seem to be to conjecture that both for the Countess and the Clown we have, instead, a marginal addition with prefix. Whether, instead, the Clown's second speech was intended to replace the first is barely possible but not probable. However, there would appear to be no question of any intended substitution in the Countess' two speeches and this fact may weigh in considering the Clown's two consecutive speeches, especially when their context is considered. The conclusions that may be drawn from this study would have more general interest if further investigation were to show that the characteristics of copy as reflected in the typesetting of this play could be paralleled elsewhere in the Folio, including other work by Compositor B. It is true that the copy for All's Well —if it were indeed Shakespeare's own foul papers as seems almost certain—is not of a kind commonly found in the Folio, for evidence is accumulating that Sir Walter Greg's frequent assignment of foul papers as Jaggard's copy has been too liberal. Indeed, insofar as the evidence of this text bears on other Folio plays, it is a natural inference that uniformity of speech-prefixes, especially, is more likely to indicate the smoothing effects of a scribe transcribing Shakespeare's papers than it does any substantial interference of the compositors with variable authorial copy, if that was what they were setting. The marked differences between the varied prefixes of All's Well and the uniform ones of such a play as Julius Caesar can represent only the distinction between authorial working papers and a scribal transcript. 32 If in All's Well the evidence has been correctly interpreted for what the compositors did with their copy, the strongest indication is present that the compositors were completely conservative in the treatment of names and titles in the stage-directions and that copy was followed in these respects with fidelity. Similarly, in the speech-prefixes there is every indication that the variation in the forms of names and titles is Shakespeare's own and present in the manuscript, including even some variant spelling of the names. It is important to establish that these variables in the manuscript copy were not suppressed and the names or titles normalized on their earlier appearances by Compositors B, C, and D. It is true that two levelling influences may occasionally be detected during the course of typesetting. The first is for the compositor to feel a slight tug toward setting prefixes in the form of the name or title in the immediately preceding stage-direction. In III.ii where the direction reads Countesse Compositor B, not Shakespeare, may have been responsible for the two immediately following prefixes of Count. before reverting to the copy's La. There are indications that in some part under the influence of copy, in some part affected by stage-directions, B came to set the prefix Ber. uniformly although the copy might have been a mixture of Ross. and Ber. Certainly on sig. X6 v in V.iii this seems to be the best explanation for the appearance of Ber. as prefix at the foot of the second column although on the evidence of the continuation of the scene on sig. Y1 Shakespeare was likely to have written the prefixes as Ross. or Ros. after the entrance on X6 v of the Widow and Diana. Nevertheless, Compositor B appears to have followed with fidelity the divagations of the prefixes for Lords G and E, and his interference with variants in more readily apprehensible characters is much less than might have been expected from a workman who on his record was likely in other respects to deal with his copy somewhat too firmly. Statistics about the incidence of his wanderings from copy in the text cannot be applied to directions and prefixes. The second tendency associated with this minor drift toward uniformity is a general compositorial preference for short forms of prefixes over longer ones when some detail in the long one is not necessary for identification. For instance, in II.i after Enter Lafew Compositor C twice set L. Laf. before going over to the invariable short Laf. The shorter the prefix the fewer ems a compositor needs to set; but perhaps as important in setting dramatic verse, the fewer problems he may make for himself in justifying long lines. Yet the history of the number of times that long forms like 1. Lord G were set, or Ol. Laf. , in All's Well indicates that author as well as compositor may be responsible for many shifts from long to short forms. Although in the order of typesetting B had composed II.iii with its Ol. Laf. prefixes after a Lafew direction, it seems probable that when later he set I.i in which the prefix is Laf. after the direction Lord Lafew , he could as readily have been following copy as not, given the care he seems to have shown elsewhere in the forms of this first scene. Moreover, when in I.iii Compositor D in continuous text followed copy from Cou. to Old Cou. and back again to Cou. after the revision, he resisted any impulse to forsake his copy in favor of uniformity. The evidence of All's Well , thus, appears to indicate that however much compositors may have styled text to suit their own spelling and punctuation habits, 33 the movement toward normalizing the dramatic appurtenances such as stage-directions and speech-prefixes was slight. As a result, evidence about the nature of the underlying Folio copy based on the characteristics of directions and prefixes can be evaluated with some confidence as representative of the copy, not of the compositors' predilections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), p. 353. Greg was writing in direct reference to J. Dover Wilson's early New Cambridge volume (1929), p. 103, which held that the corruption in the text "frequently suggests the carelessness of some hasty transcriber. Our notes will reveal a number of errors—verbal transpositions and the like—which seem easier to attribute to a copyist than to a compositor. . . . In any case, we can hardly doubt the existence of a hasty transcriber." This view is no longer held. 2 Ibid . In fact, the dashes seem to have nothing to do with any cuts or alterations, and the only broken line of consequence—Helena's 'Not my virginity yet:' (I.i [169])—is as assignable to an original defect or incomplete inscription in the manuscript as to a copyist (or compositor). The value of the evidence for the lack of 'Shakespearian spellings' is difficult to assess. It is appropriate to remark here, however, that analysis of the spelling by Compositors A and B of two inserts in Julius Caesar in a different hand from that of the regular manuscript has revealed little or nothing to indicate what was demonstrably a change in the copy except for different abbreviations in the speech-prefixes faithfully followed both by A and by B in the revised section of the duplicate announcement of Portia's death and in the first conference of Brutus and the conspirators, for which see Brents Stirling, " Julius Caesar in Revision," Shakespeare Quarterly , 13 (1962), 187-205. As for the errors in the text, Greg's point that these are more numerous than should be expected from compositors working on an autograph manuscript might be valid if the manuscript had been Shakespeare's fair copy (a doubtful assumption for any play); but if it were his 'foul papers,' then various errors could be expected owing to the difficulties of setting from a reworked draft manuscript. 3 Greg seems to be referring to J. Dover Wilson's early New Cambridge volume (1929), p. 103: "Here as there [ Measure for Measure ], for instance, the 'corruption frequently suggests the carelessness of some hasty transcriber' [footnote to p. 97 of the New Cambridge MM ]. Our notes will reveal a number of errors—verbal transpositions and the like—which seem easier to attribute to a copyist than to a compositor. . . . In any case, we can hardly doubt the existence of a hasty transcriber." Wilson proved to be correct that the copy for Measure for Measure was a scribal transcript, since it was later established that the scribe Ralph Crane was responsible. But that Crane made any extra-hasty copy is not apparent; and it is quite definite that the parallels that Wilson saw between the printer's copy for the two plays are false, for Crane could have had nothing to do with All's Well . Greg's final point that some of the play's 'sententious fustian' might be attributed to a scribe is uncharacteristic of his usual sensible thinking and cannot be taken seriously. 4 The significance of these variable prefixes as evidence for foul-papers copy as against a transcript was first pointed out by R. B. McKerrow, "The Elizabethan Printer and Dramatic Manuscripts," R.E.S. , 11 (1935), 459-465. His interpretation has never been seriously challenged. 5 William Shakespeare , 1 (1930), 450. Chambers continues that he suspects in the Gentleman astringer of V.i. that Shakespeare wrote 'Gentle&lt;man&gt; Usher' and that the book-keeper added over it the initial 'T' of an actor to create the misreading in the Folio. He also brings up the question (repeated by Greg from him) of the dashes at I.i (55) and I.iii (477), the two short lines at III.v (1650-51), and the abrupt change of subject at I.i (179) as possibly indicating cuts. If the dashes do indeed mark cuts (and there is no real evidence that they do), they could as readily be Shakespeare's as the book-keeper's. The short lines at 1650-51 are resolvable into regular pentameters. Only the break at 179 is evidence of possible disruption, but it could be authorial as well. In short, in these respects no need exists to conjecture interference with the text by a book-keeper. 6 New Arden, pp. xv-xvii. However, the present writer disagrees with Professor Hunter's assignments of error in these speech-prefixes, as will be illustrated below. The meaning of G. and of E. as identification devices is problematic. One might guess, however, that in Shakespeare's mind they could have referred to two Christian names for the characters (such as George and Edward), that is, if from the start Shakespeare had conceived of these two lords as brothers, something that we shall never know and perhaps a doubtful proposition to advance with any confidence. 7 All references are to the TLN (through-line-numbers) as marked in the Norton facsimile of the First Folio edited by C. J. K. Hinman (1968). The description of the printing is drawn from Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2 (1963), 457-470, 481-482. On the evidence then available, Dr. Hinman assigned sigs. V3 and V3 v (pp. 233-234) to Compositor A, whereas I accept the attribution of these two pages to Compositor D made on more refined evidence by Trevor Howard-Hill, "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," Studies in Bibliography , 26 (1973), 61-106. 8 The intention no doubt is to refer back to the scene of Bertram and the French Lords at II.i. There is no need to suppose that this direction was intended to cancel or to modify that calling them two Gentlemen at 1446. 9 The phrase the Maide called Diana may just possibly have some reference to a difficulty about her name while the play was being worked on. The rather pointless lines of IV.ii (2019-20) ' Ber . They told me that your name was Fontybell . | Dia . No my good Lord, Diana ' that follow this direction may refer to some change of mind about Diana's name and even to some material cut or revised out of the manuscript as printed. The direction for III.v (1603-5) that first introduces Diana contains, in itself, a possible revisory problem: ' Enter old Widdow of Florence, her daughter, Violenta and Mariana, with other Citizens .' It is a toss-up whether Violenta is a ghost character (that she is not a mute is very likely shown by 1724 since the Matron is Mariana and the gentle Maide is presumably Diana) or whether the comma is misplaced and Diana was originally named Violenta. 10 At the end of II.iv when Bertram is bidding farewell to Helena, the Folio reads: ' Ber . I pray you stay not, but in hast to horse. | Hel . I shall not breake your bidding, good my Lord: | Where are my other men? Monsieur, farwell. Exit ' (1364-66). Modern editors except for the New Arden follow Theobald ii in transposing the punctuation to read 'men, Monsieur?' and assigning the line as addressed by Bertram to Parolles, Bertram then continuing with 1367 which has his prefix Ber . However, in 1491 we learn that Bertram has traveled to Florence with Parolles and only one servant, and we have seen this servant at 2181-86. Thus it is not very likely that Bertram broke off his farewell to Helena in order to inquire of Parolles about 'my other men'. Indeed, the only defence of the emendation would be the two examples of an apparently misplaced insertion in IV.iii (2226, 2245) in which the beginning of one speech is appended to the end of the preceding. However, these come so close together as to seem to be special cases and they are not repeated elsewhere in the play so far as can be observed. Moreover, in both places the sense is quite obviously disrupted, something that is by no means true for Helena's speech once the difficulty of the 'other men' is solved by giving her an attendant to address, who should enter with her at 1325. The sequence of acquiescence to Bertram, the preparation for her departure, and a polite farewell to Parolles is so normal that emendation appears to be ill-advised, for it involves not only the transfer of the line to Bertram but also the radical alteration of its punctuation to conform to the changed assignment. In this respect, particularly, emendation requires more than the hypothesis that Compositor B mistook the position of a marginal addition. All that is needed to flesh out Helen's line is a mute attendant. The word 'other' seems to prevent a hypothesis that she could call the question off-stage. 11 This remark plus Helena's letter to the King, if delivered in secret, could lead to the fantasy that throughout V.iii the King knew all the facts, but the action says otherwise. 12 See footnote 4 above. 13 " Julius Caesar in Revision," Shakespeare Quarterly , 13 (1962), 187-205. 14 Given B's leaning toward maximally abbreviated forms of prefixes elsewhere, it could be argued that A's Cass. form was that of the copy, particularly since on one occasion B himself set a Cass. prefix. On the other hand, given the order of setting, this hypothesis requires B to have abbreviated to Cas. the Cass. of the manuscript on his very first setting of the prefix, with no guide in the directions as to the name of the character. (In All's Well the same sort of reduction may have occurred with B's setting of Ros. for possible copy Ross. ) On the other hand, if Cas. were thought to be the copy-form, A's first Cass. could be conjecturally explained as the influence of the immediately preceding stage-direction in which Cassius heads the group entrance. It would then follow that having established the fuller form, A stuck to it for the rest of his stint on the same Folio page. If as I like to believe the revised manuscript copy was actually Shakespeare's autograph, the possibility exists that both Cas. and Cass. were present in the copy, in which case one or other compositor would then have established his own form. However, on the evidence of All's Well the odds may favor the fuller Cass. in the manuscript and B's abbreviation. 15 C's treatment of the standard Hell. prefix for Helena, which he might reduce to Hel. although admitting Hell. , is another indication that, like B, he preferred short forms. 16 Actually, in this case the anomalous catchword of a speech-prefix may suggest that C had set it from copy, for it marks not a new speech by the Countess but a continuation, and hence it seems to reflect some disruption or abnormality in the copy repeated by the compositor more than it resembles an adopted speech-prefix altered from copy. 17 Compositor B made his first acquaintance with Lafeu when he set V5 v , heading it with Ol. Lord . It seems simpler to conjecture that he mistook a copy prefix like Ol. L. , Ol. La. , or even Old Laf. , since he had never seen the name Lafew, than that at this bibliographical juncture Shakespeare had written a variant prefix. Since in 994, the immediately preceding speech, the prefix is 4. Lord , B would be bound to interpret any L abbreviation as Lord . 18 The stage-direction in some plays could affect the future form of prefixes when a character's first speech followed immediately after his entrance and the name in the direction took the place of the prefix. In such a case if the compositor supplied the prefix missing in the copy, it would almost inevitably be in the form of the direction. However, such a speculation does not seem appropriate here, for the substitution of direction for prefix is ordinarily associated with single entrances where there could be no ambiguity, but in III.ii the Clown enters with the Countess. 19 The facts are as follows. In I.i on sig. V1 v the Countess is his Mother in the opening direction (2) and Mo. in speech-prefixes (4 ff.). On V2 v -3 in I.iii she is Countesse in the direction (328) and Coun. or Cou. in the prefixes (329 ff.) save for a stretch of revision in the copy where between 451 and 494 opening V3-3 v she is Old Cou. before reverting to Cou. at 514. Next in II.ii on V4 v she is Countesse in the direction (824) but Lady or La. in the prefixes (825 ff.) on V4 v -5. In III.ii on X1 she is Countesse in the direction (1401), Count. in the prefixes that follow at 1402 and 1406, but then Lad. or La. on X1-1 v . In III.iv after Countesse in the direction (1555) on X1 v she is La. In IV.v on X5 the direction is old Lady (2481) and the prefixes La. (2489 ff.) on X5-5 v . Finally, in V.iii she is again old Lady in the direction (2695) on X6 but Old La. in prefixes (2701 ff.) on X6-6 v except for her only speech on sig. Y1, where she is given the tag Coun. (2919). 20 Unfortunately, when B took over with sheet V2.5 he set all the rest of the play. If the practice of other compositors could have been observed during the last three acts, we should know more about B's degree of normalization in this play. 21 This can scarcely be anything else but a manuscript form since it is uninfluenced by any adjacent stage-direction. That it is aberrant is clear because of the confusion it could create with Coun. or Cou. used earlier for the Countess. 22 That B might look over earlier set pages (if available) to make sure that he was following established prefix forms cannot be entertained in view of his change from the forms of the immediately preceding pages. He would have needed to go back to V2 v to find Cou. and Ber. , with Ros. in its complementary page V5. The evidence suggests that he followed copy without considering the possibility that the prefix for Ros. had been normalized to another form. Of course, it is likely that the sheets were stored and consultation would have been difficult. The case differs from that between the inner and outer formes of X1:6. 23 The New Arden edition has the only discussion to date of bibliographical reasons for certain of the changes. Although at the time Hinman's study was not in being and thus the editor, G. K. Hunter, could not be aware of the fact that a serious delay occurred between B's setting of quire X and pages Y1-1 v , he shrewdly recognized that something in the bibliographical division of the text by quires would account for the changes in the prefixes for the Countess and Bertram between X and Y. 24 Any such hypothesis would require B on returning to set X6 v after the delay to have consulted X6 r in the opposite printed forme to align his speech-prefixes. This is not an impossible hypothesis: in contrast to the probable storage of sheets of the Folio after X by the time B returned to set Y, the partly printed sheet X1:6 in its inner forme would have been available. Even so, such a hypothesis requires two stages: first, the influence of the stage-direction on the first prefix and then the consultation that established the form of the second prefix even though copy may have differed in both instances. 25 These and other sections of the play suspected of being revisions or the breaking-off points of writing are analyzed in my "Shakespeare at Work: The Foul Papers of All's Well that Ends Well ," forthcoming in 1980 in a festschrift honoring Professor Dame Helen Gardner's seventieth birthday to be published by the Oxford University Press, a study that also takes up the vexed question of the prefixes of the two French Lords G and E. 26 That it is a so-called 'mass entry' is unlikely, for evidence does not exist that this was a Shakespearean convention. It is possible but not perhaps probable that the false entrance marks another memorandum for later action. 27 In the New Arden edition, p. xii, fn. 3, G. K. Hunter assumes that Ol. Laf. on V5 and Ol. Lord on V5 v derive in order from Ol. L. in copy. But such precision of reconstruction is not possible on the evidence, for the setting of V5 v before V5 quite alters the picture. It is true that when B first encountered the prefix on V5 v he could have misinterpreted Ol. L. and set Ol. Lord ; but the same could have been true with the prefix Ol. Laf. , which was probably that of the copy: at this point never having set a prefix for Lafeu he could have no notion of the character's name. Ol. Laf. in copy, therefore, would have meant nothing to him, and under the influence of 4. Lord in the prefix in the line above, the L would have suggested Lord regardless of the following letters. It is a small point, also, but a survey of the copy prefixes suggests that Shakespeare was more inclined to abbreviate the first element in a two-part prefix, like L. Laf. or L. G. , or even Ol. Lady , than the second, although there are exceptions such as what may have been the copy Old Cou . 28 The authority and the proper identification of these two characters throughout the play are considered at length in my "Shakespeare at Work," for which see fn. 25 above. 29 This revision in the text is analyzed in my "Shakespeare at Work," for which see the reference in fn. 25 above. It should be remarked that in this case because of Helena's intervening entrance the fact of the repeated prefix is not the major evidence for a revision but instead the change in the form of the prefix associated with its repetition and continued throughout the addition, only to revert to the initial form when the compositor carried on with the original text. Indeed, simple repetition of a tag like this is occasionally found in dramatic texts when a character continues a speech after the entrance of another person, especially if the continuation is thereupon addressed to the newly entered character. Moreover, because of the occasional convention that the name of an entrance direction could stand for the prefix when the entering character immediately speaks, it may have been that a repetition of the tag for the original speaker was useful to remove any ambiguity about the speaker of such lines after the interruption of an entrance. Thus in I.iii the alteration in form at 451 for a sequence of Old Cou. prefixes intervening in a sequence of Cou. forms that later resume is the essential evidence for addition. 30 No reason exists to suppose that C, completing V4 v , would obey any mark in the manuscript for cast-off copy so rigidly as to end his page in mid-speech (even though at the end of a sentence) and to set as catchword a repeated speech-prefix for what would be the continuation over-page. Indeed, since copy from V4 was being set forward in the quire, there is a possibility that it had not been cast off at all until V6 v was reached and quire X had to be worked on. That C could have inserted Lady. as prefix at the end of the page as a note to the next compositor of the form which the prefix should take is mere fantasy, especially since it would necessarily involve the hypothesis that though C had set Lady as his prefixes on V4 v , the manuscript had read Cou. 31 Editors have taken it that the sequence of speech-prefixes for the Clown at 1243 and 1245 signifies that some reply of Parolles has dropped out. That a gap of some sort existed seems clear, but slight desperation may be evident in the New Arden's alternative explanation, "it is possible to keep F text assuming only that the clown pauses and, presuming Parolles' answer, replies to that." As remarked, two such prefixes are not unknown in some plays if a stage-direction intervenes between the parts of a single speech and the person entering is thereupon addressed; but this is not the situation in All's Well : no direction occurs here nor is it likely that one has been lost. (Sisson's expedient, followed by Evans, of having Parolles shake his head between the speeches is not satisfactory and would not call for a direction, anyway. Moreover, the customary requirement of a change of address is wanting.) Editors endeavoring to fill the gap with some supposed answer from Parolles have not offered any suggestion that carries conviction as the generator of the Clown's 'The search sir was profitable'. The New Cambridge conjecture ' Parolles . In myself.' is about as much as can be done, but carries no conviction. It is moot, then, whether a line or so by Parolles has dropped out or where there is another explanation for the anomaly. Since the second speech hinges on the first, it is possible to guess that the second was a marginal addition in the manuscript, although one must confess that the duplicated speech-prefix could be more easily explained if the second speech had been the original and the first, with its prefix, had been inserted. Nevertheless, if the Countess' duplicated prefix in 861-863 does indeed result from an addition, then the hypothesis can be advanced here as well. The continuity of the two speeches read as one is not ideal, but sufficient. 32 In Julius Caesar , as remarked, the scribe carefully thought out the problem of the speech-prefixes and to avoid ambiguity he settled on Cassi. for Cassius and Cask. for Casca and thus prevented possible confusion with the other and with Cœs. for Caesar. 33 The various eccentric spellings that have been labeled 'Shakespearean' are notably absent from All's Well ; but the smoothing here is not surprising when one considers that compositors in 1622-23 were dealing with an old-fashioned manuscript written two decades earlier. The Folio All's Well is not the Second Quarto of Hamlet .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Miltonic Documents in the Public Record Office, London by Robert Thomas Fallon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is a report on a search of the State Papers Foreign of the Public Record Office conducted during the summer of 1977. 1 With few exceptions the documents found have been identified before as Miltonic or possibly Miltonic in at least one of the published sources. 2 However, it has not been known that aside from the Skinner transcripts, SP 9/194, there are copies of these specific State Papers in the PRO. In several instances, copies have been known to exist only in foreign archives. The search suggested itself when, in preparing a study of Milton's experience as Secretary for Foreign Languages, I discovered that the State Papers Foreign (SP 71-113) had been generally neglected by his editors and biographers. Why this is so is not clear, possibly because his role in foreign affairs was of far less importance, hence of less interest to Miltonists, than his function as propagandist for the English Republic. My own inquiries revealed that though he was surely no mover and shaker in the government, the great majority of his time as public servant was spent in correspondence with foreign powers. Indeed, during the six years of the Protectorate, this appears to be all he did to earn his salary ( Defensio Secunda and Pro Se Defensio were not commissioned by the government). Thus the State Papers Foreign seemed a natural place to look for one seeking insight into the activities of Mr. Secretary Milton. 3 These discoveries produced unanticipated benefits, for the identification of the documents as part of the official government collection is of value in two respects. First, the archival environment of a letter, that is, the papers which accompany it in the file, throws light on the circumstances of its composition not always apparent when it is a part of a collection of his papers, isolated from that environment. A second advantage is the identification of the handwriting. If a series of documents, including one or two of Milton's, appears to have been transcribed or copied in the same hand, and presumably at the same time, our ability to place his letters in their historical setting is much enhanced. Based on either or both of these considerations, I am suggesting herein that certain letters not previously considered Miltonic be accepted as such. This is a process fraught with peril, of course, and perhaps a word or two of rationale will soften the impression of headstrong rashness. As a general rule, the editors of the State Papers have identified as Miltonic only those documents which appear in the three contemporary transcripts, the Skinner MS, the Columbia MS, and the Literae . With some few exceptions, they limit themselves to the publication of letters, copies of which Milton seems to have retained in the course of his official duties, though Prose hews this line more strictly than does Works . This is an entirely appropriate editorial policy for such volumes, but it is far too restrictive for a scholar attempting to evaluate Milton's role in government. A biographer who does not go beyond these collections will emerge with a very limited view of that role, for he is proceeding on the assumption that Milton kept a copy of every paper he worked on and that we have them all. Such an assumption is highly questionable. For example, one of his tasks was to produce English translations of Latin correspondence received from abroad. If a biographer uses the Prose volume as his source, he will discover that only about a dozen or so papers in English are accepted as Miltonic. One can surely assume that Cromwell's Secretary for Foreign Languages performed this duty somewhat more frequently than an average of once a year. This search was undertaken for biographical, as well as bibliographical, reasons. The proposals for expanding the canon of State Papers are an effort to fill in the very sketchy outline we have of Milton's office and, perhaps of greater importance, to excite some interest in further exploration among Miltonists. These proposals are based on two factors which have not been given adequate consideration in the past; the first is a practice common to government bodies such as the one Milton served and the second is the archival environment of the letters, already mentioned. It will be of value to review these factors, so as to avoid unnecessary repetition in the description of the documents. If there is a requirement for extensive correspondence on a single issue or a prospect of protracted negotiations for a treaty, it is a common practice in any government structure to appoint an "action officer" whose task it is to see the project through to its conclusion. The advantages are obvious. If one person is thoroughly informed on the matter at hand and keeps himself abreast of developments, there is no need for the time-consuming orientation of a series of secretaries concerning points of contention, controversies over specific wording, often important, or shifts in bargaining positions. The busy executive body, juggling many problems at once, can avoid the annoyance of constant rehash and review if one person is made historian and agent on any single matter. This was as true of the Republican governments of the 1650's as it is today, and Milton frequently acted in this capacity, as in the Oldenburg Safeguard and the Portuguese negotiations of 1651. In later years, when his activity was limited to correspondence, he was assigned duties on this basis. He was responsible, for example, for Cromwell's letters on the Piedmont Massacre in May, 1655, and for much of the subsequent correspondence that was precipitated by that event. When the need arose for diplomatic credentials for ambassadors on foreign missions, he was quite logically asked to prepare all the letters required for a single mission, such as the six for William Jephson on August 20, 1657, and the five for Fauconberg in May, 1658. The archival environment of a document is equally suggestive, for the accompanying papers can in many ways clarify both the historical context and the person's role in events. Further, the presence of a variety of documents together in a single file may indicate a relationship among them not otherwise evident. Caution is required, of course, particularly in evaluating Interregnum records, which are at best chaotic. But if, for example, one or two of Milton's letters appear in the midst of a body of documents all devoted to a single issue, one may feel justified in entertaining the thought that some of the accompanying papers are perhaps his work. Or if five Miltonic letters appear in a transcript in a single hand, it is not too rash to suggest that a sixth, on the same subject in the same hand, is his also. In the interest of clarity, and at the risk of tediousness, it will be of some value to outline the editorial practices followed: 1. This is an annotated list, including only information sufficient to identify the document in relation to the known versions and to suggest its significance. Variants are noted, therefore, only when they are to this purpose. The phrase "verbally identical to" is used somewhat loosely; there are slight differences in documents so compared, but in the opinion of the author these are minor in nature, the result of normal scribal errors. The word "Miltonic" is used to identify papers whose wording reflects what Milton wrote or dictated to an amanuensis, in the process either of composition or simple translation. Effort is made, not always successfully, to distinguish between a "draft" or "working paper" used by the composer in the evolution of a document and a "transcript" made by another without his assistance. The word "copy" avoids the issue. 2. Since this is a report on the PRO holdings, reference to published collections is limited to Works and Prose . The reader is encouraged to refer to J. Max Patrick's source information in Prose . 3. Each document is numbered by country. This represents an identification number, useful in cross-referencing. The papers are listed in the order of their folio pages in the PRO file. This causes some awkwardness at times, but it is hoped that parenthetical cross-referencing will lessen the problem. 4. To avoid unnecessary repetitions in the descriptions of papers, identification marks appear before document numbers. They indicate: (a) Single *—a document recognized as Miltonic. It has been found in other collections in England, but the copy in the PRO is identified here for the first time. (b) Double **—a document recognized as Miltonic. It has been found in foreign archives, but the copy in the PRO is the first to be identified as a part of a collection in England. 4 (c) Single #—a document known to Miltonists, but rejected as Miltonic in one or more published collections. For reasons cited, it is proposed here as an addition to his State Letters. (d) Double ##—a document unnoted by Miltonists. For reasons cited, it is proposed here as an addition to his State Letters. 5. A number of documents not attributable to Milton are either listed or noted. They are included when (a) it is of value to identify the archival environment of a document, (b) a file of some importance to Milton scholarship seems to have been overlooked, e.g., the Oldenburg papers, (c) they are cited for one reason or another in the scholarship, but have never been found, e.g., Mylius' farewell speech (Oldenburg 9), or (d) there appears to be a possibility, however remote, that they are Miltonic, though there is not sufficient evidence as yet to support such a claim. 6. Discussion of historical context of the letters is limited. The reader is encouraged, once more, to consult J. Max Patrick's headnotes in Prose . 7. In summary, the reader will find, as a minimum, the following information on each document (to use the first entry below as an example): (a) The name of the country and the PRO file in which the paper appears, e.g., "Hamburg and Hanse Towns, SP 82/8." (b) The assigned number of the document with asterisk indicating its significance. For cross-reference it will be cited by country and number, e.g., "Hamburg and Hanse Towns 1." (c) In parentheses, the pagination in the file and the language of the document, e.g., "(128-29, English)." (d) The title of the document as it appears in Prose , with information concerning date and signature, e.g., " Cum Antiquam Amicitiam , unsigned." (e) In parentheses, the number of the document as assigned in the two principle collections, e.g., "( Works , 18; Prose , 37)."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hamburg and Hanse Towns, SP 82/8 The exchange of letters with Hamburg is well represented in the PRO: SP 82/7, ff. 122-225 (Apr 2-June 29, 1650) and SP 82/8, ff. 1-126 (July 2, 1650-July 30, 1651). Prose identifies copies of Quantis Bellorum ( Prose , 1) and an English version of Quam Diu ( Works , 1; Prose , 5) in SP 82/7. *1. (128-29, English) An early draft of the Parlamentum Reipublicae Angliae, Cum Antiquam Amicitiam ( Works , 18; Prose , 37), unsigned. The cover sheet of 1 and 2 (below) is endorsed "Copy of the Letter to the Citty of Hamburgh Mart 11, 1651/2." The final two-thirds of the first paragraph is marked with a vertical line in the margin, indicating the section to be revised. *2. (130, English) A later version of 1, with the marked section revised, unsigned. This is very close to the approved version, but it is not the final draft. There is, for example, no English equivalent in either 1 or 2 for the Latin " in navem praedatoriam " in the approved version. *3. (132, English) A translation of 4 (below), headed "To the Hanse Towns," unsigned, undated. The copy in Nalson XVIII, 160, is torn in two or three places, as Prose notes (p. 611), but what remains is verbally identical to this translation. *4. (134, Latin) A copy of Parlamentum Reipublicae Angliae Literas Vestras Sexto ( Works , 25; Prose , 43). This appears to be a version of the fair copy from which Literae , p. 36, was transcribed. They are verbally identical, the " de " being scratched out and " ab " inserted. It is endorsed "Read 13 Aprill, 1652 &amp; uppon the Question agreed," and signed "Hen: Scobell, Clic Parliament." The source notes in Prose err in identifying Nalson, X, 85, as a draft of this letter (p. 611). This could be a simple typographical oversight; on the other hand it might have been caused by the inscription on the cover-sheet of Nalson X, 85, which is erroneously endorsed, "Prl. Lte. to Hans Towns" (see 5 &amp; 7 below). *5. (Bodleian Library, Nalson MS, XVIII, 161; Latin). A semi-final draft of 4 above. While this copy is not in the PRO, it is included here because it is a copy of the letter to the Hanse Towns and it is not mentioned in Prose . Further, I suspect that this copy is the one erroneously identified as Nalson, X, 85, in the source notes (p. 611), though it differs in some respects from the description there, e.g., it has " de " not " ab ," is endorsed "Read 13 April 1652 &amp; agreed unto," and has " aequitate ." A few words are torn out. *6. (136, English) A translation of 7 below, headed "To Hamburgh," undated, unsigned. It is verbally identical to the text of Bodleian, Nalson, XVIII, 149, as published in Prose , p. 609. *7. (138, Latin) A copy of Parlamentum Reipublicae Angliae, Literas Vestras Quinto ( Works , 26; Prose , 42). It is endorsed "Read 13 April 1652 &amp; uppon the Question agreed," and signed "Hen: Scobell, Clic Parliament." It differs from Nalson, X, 85, in some respects, the address, for example, reading " Proconsulibus et Senatoribus " with the " Pro " obliterated. Neither address agrees with Works , 26. Prose remains confusing on Nalson, X, 85 (p. 608). I do not find " perlegum " inserted after " perlegit ." " Eumque " is inserted there, however, so that the text agrees with the approved wording. The Nalson copy is properly identified in Prose as a semi-final draft, while it appears that this one was transcribed from the approved text. 8. (140, English) A Parliamentary order dated April 13, 1652, and signed by Scobell, directing that the letters be sent. It reads in part, "Collonell Morley Reported from the Councell of State severall letters to be sent to the Hanse Townes and Hamburgh which were this day read first in Lataine and after in English and upon the Question assented unto." Comment: Scobell's order (8) indicates that "severall letters" were approved on April 13, 1652. A search of SP 82/7 &amp; 8 and Bodleian, Nalson X &amp; XVIII revealed only these two (4 &amp; 7 above) marked as having been read on that date. Assuming that "severall" means more than two, it appears that there were more letters to Hamburg and the Hanse Towns in the group. If found, they could reasonably be attributed to Milton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holland, SP 84/162 1. (164, Latin) A copy of a letter from Richard Cromwell to the States General, announcing his assumption as Protector and continuing George Downing as Resident, unsigned, dated September 6, 1658. 2. (165, English) "Richard P. Instructions to George Downing Esq: Our Resident with ye Lords ye States Generall," unsigned, dated September 6, 1658. This order to Downing reappoints him to office and gives him more specific instructions to carry out the provisions of the letter. Comment: The letter is not included in any collection of Milton's letters, nor has it been identified as Miltonic. It is, however, an example of a document which because of the date and subject deserves to be considered. When Richard assumed the position of Protector, it was necessary to inform other nations that an orderly succession had taken place, that former policies would not change, and that former Ambassadors and Residents were being reappointed. There are two of Milton's letters to that effect, one to Louis XIV ( Works , 124; Prose , 159) and a companion to Mazarian ( Works , 125; Prose , 160), of the same substance and with the same date as this one to the States General. It is reasonable to assume that Milton was responsible for the preparation of letters to more than one of the many European states that had to be contacted at that time, but in the absence of any more substantive evidence, no definite claim for attribution can be made here.</field>

See the catalogue for 96/6 (PRO, Round Room, Press 15/140), p. 24, where appears the following notation, "Documents relating to Savoy, March-August, 1655, formerly in this bundle were moved to S.P. 92/24 in August 1953." #6. (358-59, Latin) Headed "Mr. Morland's Speech to the Duke of Savoy 1655," unsigned ( Works , 153). This copy is verbally identical to the speech identified in Works , p. 476, as "First Draft Prepared by Milton for Samuel Morland." It is not the one presented, for Morland revised it before delivery. The final speech appears in Works , pp. 482-89, transcribed from Morland's History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piedmont , 1658, pp. 568 ff. It will be of value to quote Works briefly, "(Hamilton) believed the draft Milton's, and that Morland had changed the speech before delivering it; and this belief was shared by Masson (V, 186, ff.) who found certain verbal parallels (which are exceedingly close and convincing) to other writings of Milton. But unfortunately Hamilton gave no reference to where his manuscript was in the State Paper office, and now it cannot be located" (p. 633). Prof. Maurice Kelley located it, for he discussed it with J. Milton French (French, IV, 30); but this was before it was transferred to SP 92/24, for French has it still in SP 96/6. The speech is not referred to in Prose . Pertinent to the Comment below, it should be mentioned that there are four additional letters in the file, all addressed to Cromwell: (318, Latin) from the States General, June 12; (323-26, Latin) from the Duke of Savoy, July 10; (342-43, French) from the Vaudois, August 26; (355-56, French) from the Vaudois, September 23. All of these were transferred with 1-6 in 1953. Two letters were not transferred, however, for some reason, and so are still on file in SP 96/6 Switzerland. They are included here, as they seem to be part of the same original packet. **7. (121, Latin) A copy of Summum Dolorem , Cromwell to the Senate of Geneva ( Works , 59; Prose , 81). It is verbally identical to Works , 59 ( Literae , p. 103) except for the opening and closing. It concludes, " Dab: ex Aula Nostra Westmonasterii 7th Junii Anno 1655. Vester bonus Amicus ," followed by a note concerning the money. 8. (123-24, Latin) A copy of a letter from the States General to the Evangelical Cantons, dated June 7, 1655, concerning the Piedmontese. Comment: The most striking aspect of these eight documents is that they are all in the same hand and apparently were deposited as a packet in SP 96/6, for the old folio numbers assigned before the transfer was made are in sequence. These circumstances strongly suggest that they are a transcript of a packet of documents sent to Morland, who had left for Savoy on May 26th. The date of the transcript can be identified fairly closely. The letter of June 12 to Cromwell from the States General is in the same hand as these eight, that of July 10 from the Duke of Savoy in a different hand. Presumably the transcript was made between these dates. There are no other documents in either file in this hand. It will be noted that seven of these documents originated in England (1-7). Of these, six have been identified as Miltonic, the draft of Morland's speech being the only one questioned. It cannot be definitely concluded, of course, that since all seven were transcribed at once and that six of them have a single author, he must, therefore, be the author of the seventh; but such a circumstance adds weight to the judgments of Hamilton, Masson, and the editors of Works that the draft of Moreland's speech is, indeed, the work of John Milton. The copy in SP 92/24, it must be emphasized, is not a transcript of the speech as delivered, but of the draft , presumably composed in May-June, when Milton was so deeply involved in the matter. The letters which did not originate in England (8 and the four to Cromwell) are included since Milton, as Cromwell's "action officer" in the secretariat, may have been responsible for their translation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Denmark SP 103/3 **1. (265-66, English) A contemporary translation of Preadictis Dominis , Council of State to the Danish Ambassadors ( Works , 29; Prose , 50), undated, unsigned. **2. (266-68, English) A contemporary translation of Concilium, Inspectis , Council of State to the Danish Ambassadors ( Works , 30; Prose , 51), undated, unsigned. Comment: These two letters appear in the middle of a document of more than usual interest, A Journall of the Proceedings Upon the Treaty between the Parliament and the Ambassadors of the King of Denmarke with what relates to the detention of the English Ships by the said King in Copenhagen (ff. 241-318). It opens with a succinct narrative of the rather torturous negotiations of May [?]-October 29, 1652, including an account of one of the Ambassadors' servants who was arrested for failure to pay his bills (ff. 241-46), which seems to have complicated matters for a time. Transcripts of all pertinent papers make up the bulk of the Journal (ff. 247-318), which seems to have survived complete, as all of the events described in the narrative are supported by documents, the final one dated October 29. The two letters attributed to Milton are part of a series of documents exchanged between the Council of State and the Ambassadors. In order to appreciate Milton's contribution, it will be of value to describe them briefly: a. June 14, ff. 250-55. The Danish Ambassadors delivered to a Committee appointed by the Council of State a draft of a treaty containing 14 points. b. July 8, ff. 256-61. The Committee delivered two letters to the Ambassadors: (1) an answer to their 14 points, and (2) a paper containing six propositions. c. July 28, ff. 261-64. The Ambassadors delivered two letters to the Committee: (1) a reply to the Council of State's answer to their 14 points, and (2) an answer to the six propositions. d. September 13, ff. 265-68. The Committee delivered two letters to the Ambassadors: (1) an answer to the Danish reply to the Council of State's answer to the 14 points, and (2) a reply to the Danish answer to the six propositions. These are Milton's letters. The date assigned in the narrative differs from that suggested in Prose , which has October 14 [?] for Prose , 50 and October 22 for Prose , 51. September 13 seems a more appropriate date for both. e. September 21, ff. 268-70. The Ambassadors delivered a reply to d above, in which, probably in desperation, they reduced the points in contention to two. f. October 5, ff. 271-73. The Committee delivered an answer to e above, identified here as "the paper . . . delivered to the Committee of the Councell att a conference the 21st of September last," thus confirming the earlier dating of Milton's letters. g. October [?], ff. 273-74. The Ambassadors, apparently despairing of any agreement, requested their credentials for return to Denmark. The narrative dates this October 1, but the letter is indefinite, "London . . . October, 1652." The Ambassadors did not depart immediately and presumably negotiations continued, but on October 13, all discussion of a treaty came to a halt, for on that date the Council of State received information that a group of English merchant vessels had been detained in Copenhagen harbor. Most of the balance of the Journal is taken up with an exchange of correspondence over this detention and with King Frederick III's refusal to permit a fleet of English warships to convoy the merchant vessels home. Aside from the two cited, Milton's involvement in these negotiations includes at least two additional letters, one written before and one after the dates of the Journal. In Literas Vestrae Majestatis Undevigesimo , Parliament to the King of Denmark, April 13, 1652 ( Works , 24; Prose , 41), the King's overtures for a treaty are welcomed. Parlamentum Reipublicae Angliae Postquam , Parliament to the King of Denmark, November 9, 1652 ( Works , 35; Prose , 52), is a sharply worded letter in which Parliament, citing evidence given by Captain Andrew Ball, Admiral of the English Fleet, rejected the Danish explanation for the detention and notified the King that Richard Bradshaw had been dispatched to negotiate the differences. Ball's testimony and supporting letters appear in the Journal (ff. 307-18), including Frederick III's "Resolution and Answer" delivered to Ball on September 25th outside Copenhagen. Milton refers to this letter in his own, but it is available here, apparently, for the first time (see Prose , p. 635 n ). Milton was involved in the affair, it would appear, from beginning to end, as his four letters seem to indicate. The question is was he more involved than these four documents evidence. By the time the negotiations broke down the Danish Ambassadors and the Council of State had exchanged no less than nine letters containing various proposals and counterproposals, only two of which are identified as his. It seems unlikely that Milton was suddenly called in at a point when the complexity of answer and reply had reached almost bewildering proportions, to prepare just two of this series of letters. It is certainly reasonable to assume that he was used from the beginning to translate the Danish proposals and prepare the English answers (see page 90 above). His blindness would have been no hindrance, as none of the documents are of excessive length and the time intervals between exchanges varied from two to six weeks. There being no supporting evidence for such a suggestion, however, no claim for attribution can be made here, though the weight of custom and reason persuades that it deserves consideration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">France PRO 31/3 This is a lengthy transcript entitled "Lists of Despatches of Ambassadors from France to England; Henry VIII—George I; with remarks on their Correspondence. By M. Armand Baschet." The collection for the period of the English Republic, PRO 31/3/98-103, is composed chiefly of letters between Cardinal Mazarin and his ambassadors, but there is a scattering of letters to and from Cromwell, six of which have been identified as Miltonic. These letters were transcribed from copies or originals in the Archives des Affaires Etrangeres, Correspondence Politique, Angleterre , Vols. 66 &amp; 69. They are identified below by volume and folio page number in the French Archives and by the type of document they were transcribed from. PRO 31/3/98 **1. (15-16, Latin) Perlati Ad Nos , Cromwell to the King of France, May 25, 1655 ( Works , 139; Prose , 78); Vol. 66, f. 1, copy; unsigned. **2. (17-18, Latin) Illatae Nuper , Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, May 25, 1655 ( Works , 112; Prose , 79); Vol. 66, f. 60, original; signed "Oliver P." **3. (82-84, Latin) Ex Literis Majestatis Vestrae , Cromwell to the King of France, July 31, 1655 ( Works , 56; Prose , 82); Vol. 66, f. 98, copy; unsigned. #4. (85, Latin) Cum E Re Visum , Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, July 31, 1655; Vol. 66, f. 96, original; signed "Oliver P." This letter lies next to and has the same date as Ex Literis Majestatis Vestrae (3 above) in French Archives. It is the original cover letter to the Cardinal, enclosing an information copy of the longer one to the King. It has not been accepted as Miltonic; rather Cum Nobilem Hunc , July 29, 1655 ( Works , 57; Prose , 83) is published, since it appears in all three contemporary transcripts. Works suggests that Cum E Re Visum "may be a revision of Cum Nobilem Hunc " (XVIII, 650); Prose dismisses it: "only conjecture could connect it with Milton" (p. 710 n ). Both letters are to the same effect, however, they enclose the letter to the King and introduce the Ambassador, George Downing. The earlier version, of which Milton kept a copy, was revised, apparently, because it was deemed advisable to mention Downing by name. To suggest that Milton wrote Ex Literis Majestatis Vestrae , which is the subject of Cum E Re Visum , and Cum Nobilem Hunc , which is a rejected earlier draft of it, but that he was not responsible for the wording of the letter finally sent to Mazarin is surely being cautious in the extreme. PRO 31/3/99 **5. (8, Latin) Cum Videam Vestris , Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, April 14, 1655 ( Works , 146; Prose , 94); Vol. 66, f. 239, original; signed "Oliver P." The transcript is dated " 4 April 1656 " in two places and the letter concludes " Alba Aula, decimo quarto die Aprilis 1656 ," but the " quarto " has been lined through and "4" inserted in the margin, both in pencil. PRO 31/3/100 **6. (57-8, Latin) Cum Dandae , Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, September 25, 1656, ( Works , 74; Prose , 113); Vol. 66, f. 112, original; signed "Oliver P." PRO 31/3/102 **7. (201, Latin) Quum Nuntiato Serenissimi , Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, May 20, 1658 ( Prose , 150); Vol. 69, f. 59, original; signed "Oliver P." Comment: Prose lists thirty letters dating from May 25, 1655, when Milton was first employed in French correspondence, to February 22, 1659; and for a number of reasons English-French relations seems a particularly promising area for exploration. To mention a few: (1) Because of the Spanish War, this was a period of close alliance between the two nations. (2) The Baschet transcript is catalogued in the 39th Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records , App. 8, May 16, 1878. There are six documents listed in the Report which, for some unaccountable reason, are missing from the collection, two of which have the same dates and addresses as known Miltonic letters; Cromwell to the King of France, July 1, 1658 ( Works , 143; Prose , 156) and Richard Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin, September 6, 1958 ( Works , 125; Prose , 160). (3) Aside from the seven documents here listed, there are fourteen additional transcripts in the file, eleven of them in French, of letters exchanged by, variously, Louis XIV, Mazarin, Oliver and Richard Cromwell, all written during the period of Milton's employment in French correspondence. Further, there are a number of "Minutes" recording additional letters exchanged among the four, many of them on matters that Milton's letters deal with—the Piedmont Massacre, Lockhart's mission, Fauconberg's mission, the fall of Dunkirk, and Cromwell's death. (4) An idiosyncracy of the correspondence with France makes it clear that we do not have all of Milton's letters to that country. During the 1650's protocol required that each letter to Louis XIV be accompanied by a companion to the regent, Cardinal Mazarin. Milton was responsible for a number of these pairs (see Prose , 78-79, 82-83, 93-94, 146-147, and 148-149 or 150), and the companion to any single letter which he is known to have written to either of these figures may be reasonably attributed to his hand, even though he may not have kept a copy of it. It seems unlikely that the efficient Thurloe would assign two secretaries to compose separate letters, one to the Cardinal and one to the King, on the same matter on the same date.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oldenburg SP 103/24 &amp; SP 81/54 Milton was responsible for the preparation in English and Latin of safeconduct credentials or a Safeguard, as it was called, issued by Parliament to the Count of Oldenburg in 1652. He was in frequent contact with Oldenburg's emissary, Herman Mylius, from October 20, 1651 to March 6, 1652, keeping him abreast of the complex negotiations that marked the passage of the document through the Committee for Trade and Foreign Affairs, the Council of State, and Parliament. For some reason, working papers used by various individuals in this affair are extremely well represented in the PRO. In 103/24, Treaty Papers, German States, for example, they constitute the entire file of papers derived from Commonwealth sources. Since this material, which relates to what is the best documented of all Milton's services as Secretary for Foreign Languages, appears to have been overlooked by Miltonists, it seems appropriate to list the papers in the various files. A more careful editing than is possible here may determine some of them to be Miltonic. Readers are encouraged to consult French, III, 78-207, where the entries in Mylius' Tagebuch are published. It will be noted that there were two separate periods of negotiations, the first in 1652, the second in 1654, when the Count quickly dispatched ambassadors to procure a confirmation of the Safeguard from the newly established Protectorate government. 103/24, Treaty Papers, German States Oldenburg 1-10 are in two folders containing documents dealing solely with the 1652 Safeguard. The folio numbers, it will be noted, are in sequence. *1. (216-17, Latin) A copy of Universis et Singulis , the Oldenburg Safeguard ( Works , 152; Prose , 35). It is verbally identical to the one printed in French (III, 180), which is based on a copy in the Oldenburg Staatsarchive, and is therefore a transcript of the approved Latin text. Beneath Milton's name, in a different hand appears, " Concordat haec copia, cum vero suo mihi exhibito originali, quod attestor ego Eimertis Lunisnu [ ? ] Hot. Publicus Caesareus ," followed by a set of initials, possibly "mppa." These initials also appear after Mylius' signature on all of the documents he signed. The copy in the Bodleian Library, Nalson MS, XVIII, 168, is an earlier draft and working paper, which as corrected conforms to the approved text and to the amended English of 11 below, except for the omission of reference to Spain (See COMMENT below). 2. (218-20, Latin) A copy of Mylius' petition to Parliament, " Petitio Parlemanto Reipublicae Angliae ," undated, signed by Mylius. ##3. (221-22, Latin) A copy of a Safeguard issued to the Duke of Holstein, undated, unsigned. (See Holstein 2). 4. (223-24, English) A translation of 2 above, undated, signed by Mylius. 5. (225-26, English) A copy of a cover letter from Mylius to the Council of State, enclosing documents defending Oldenburg (10 below). These papers were delivered at his farewell audience and are mentioned in his speech (6 &amp; 9 below). 6. (227-29, English) A translation of 9 below, "Thanksgiving, Recommendation, and Valediction before the Right Honorable the Committee of the Councell of State," dated March 2, 1652, signed by Mylius. The penultimate paragraph is in a different hand. 7. (235, Latin) A cover letter, addressed to Parliament, enclosing the " Memoriale " (8 below) for their consideration, undated, signed by Mylius. 8. (237-40, Latin) A " Memoriale " from Mylius to the Council of State defending the Count against accusation, dated 28 January, 1652, signed by Mylius. 9. (243-46, Latin) A copy of Mylius' farewell speech to the Council of State, " Gratiorum actio, Recommendatio et Valedictio, coram Augusti Consillii Status Nobilissimus Dominis Commissarius ," dated March 2, 1652, signed by Mylius. This appears to be the document he refers to in his Tagebuch (French, III, 203). He indicates that it is to be inserted at a certain point in the text, but as French says, "No document follows the Jnseratur " (III, 204). To the best of my knowledge, it has not been identified before. 10. (247-54, English) A copy of a letter from Oldenburg to the States General, entitled, "A Short Deduction, why the Count of Oldenburg cannot part with the Weser-Tole, etc.," dated 17/27 January, 1652, unsigned. In his farewell speech, Mylius indicates that he is leaving this document with the Council of State for their information. It is a lengthy explanation (despite the "Short") of the rights granted the Count by the Holy Roman Emperor to collect tolls on the Weser River and was part of Mylius' defense of the Count against accusations concerning his trafficking with Royalists, questions which delayed the approval of the Safeguard for some weeks. (See French, III, 154-55 and 178-79, where Mylius mentions "a message of the States to the Count," to which this one is probably the answer). Oldenburg 11-15 are in a single folder of papers, all relating to the 1654 Safeguard. Note that the folio numbers are in no way related. *11. (54-55, English) A copy of "Bee it knowne unto all" ( Works , 152; Prose , 35), undated, with only Lenthall's signature. This is an early draft, agreeing with the copy in the Oldenburg Staatsarchive ( Prose , p. 576, Manuscript C). The presence of this copy in the folder of papers devoted to the 1654 Safeguard indicates that it was used as a working paper in composing the later document. It is written in the same secretary hand as Oldenburg 4, 5, 6, 10 above, and 17 below, which suggests that it was transcribed at the same time as the others in 1651-52 and kept on file for later reference. *12. (170 b-c, Latin) A copy of Universis et Singulis , dated 17 February, 1651, with the names of Lenthall, Milton and Scobell at the closing. Under Milton's name appears, " Johannes Miltonius, a Secretis, Consilii Status ." It is verbally identical to the approved text and was probably used, like 11 above, as a working paper for the 1654 Safeguard. All of the available Latin texts, except for Bodleian, Nalson, XVIII, 168 ( Prose Manuscript C) appear to be copies of the approved version, for they all include reference to Spain and France. 13. (284a, Latin) An original memorial from Oldenburg, signed by his 1654 emissaries, Wolzogny and Gryphiander, stamped with their official seals. It is endorsed " Exhibitum 19 Junii Anno 1654 " and identified as "Letter from ye Commissioner of Count Oldenburg desiring ratification of the Salvaguard formerly granted ye said Count, 19th June, 1654." 14. (285-86, English) A translation of 13 above. 15. (423, Latin) A document entitled, " Formalia Confirma Lionis [ ? ] Exemptionis ," unsigned, undated. It is endorsed, "Draught of a ratification of the Salvaguard delivered in by the Agents of Count Oldenburg." Comment: (These remarks are based on a personal examination of all copies except the four in the Oldenburg Staatsarchive, identified in the source notes of Prose , 35, and referred to below, as MSS C, D, E, and F). Prose lists seven copies of the Safeguard, four in English and three in Latin (p. 576). With the three added here, it would seem a simple matter to reconstruct the evolution of the final document but, as is often the case, new discoveries have a way of presenting more questions than answers. While this is not the appropriate place to enter into the intricacies of editing, the variants pose certain intriguing problems. Among them: (1) The question of the inclusion of the Duke's successors. How did an English translation which includes the successors end up in the Oldenburg archives "beautifully written on parchment with a wafer seal" ( Prose , p. 576)? The reference was struck from the document during the February 11 meeting of the Council of State; at least this is the date when Mylius first noted its absence. Thus this copy seems to have been prepared in final form and dispatched long before the Safeguard was approved and worthy of any "wafer" whatsoever. (2) The question whether the Safeguard includes protection in Spain and France. (See Works , p. 474, ll. 13-14). Oldenburg 11 and MS D mention only Spain. Nalson, XVIII, 168 &amp; 169, the copy in SP 25/66, pp. 324-26, No. 16 ( Prose erroneously has 26), and MS C name only France. The rest include both France and Spain. In brief, none of the English copies name both countries and all of the Latin versions, with the exception of Nalson, XVIII, 168, do. The inclusion of a major European power in such a document is of more than usual importance and, one would think, not subject to the normal scribal error. The final Safeguard included both countries, but what was the problem? (3) At its February 11 meeting, the Council of State, in addition to deleting the reference to Oldenburg's successors, added the phrase, "who shall view our present letters patent," to the first sentence of the English draft. It appears in the approved Latin as " praesentes literas patentes inspecturis " ( Works , p. 470, ll. 13-14). At the same time they changed "within the Borders of Concord and modesty" ( Works , p. 473, ll. 7-8) to "within the bounds." These changes are helpful in identifying versions written before and after that date, but what in the world difference do they make? On the basis of these various additions and deletions it is possible to venture an analysis of the sequence of composition of these documents, one which more careful editing may correct. Of the five Latin copies it appears that four are transcripts of the approved Safeguard; Nalson, XVIII, 168 alone is earlier. The five English copies appear to have been written in the following sequence: MS C ( Works , 152) is the earliest version. Oldenburg 11, as amended, is next in order. Nalson, XVIII, 169, is yet later, since it incorporates corrections made in earlier drafts. The copy in SP 25/66 is later still, since it incorporates changes made in Nalson, XVIII, 169. MS D is the lates of all, but still without reference to France and Spain. We do not, therefore, have an English translation of the approved Latin. SP 81/54 German States Nos. 16-19 concern the 1652 Safeguard, the balance deal with the 1654 negotiations. There are no copies of known Miltonic documents in this file. 16. (54, Latin) A letter from Oldenburg to Parliament, dated August 15, 1651. This is a copy of Mylius' credentials. There is a copy in Bodleian, Nalson, XVIII, 167. To the best of my knowledge, neither one of these copies has been noted heretofore. (See French, III, 85). 17. (55, English) A translation of 16 above. It is endorsed "Read 15 Oct, 1651," "Read 15 October 1651 &amp; referred to the Councell of State," and "Letters of Credence." It is in the same secretary hand as the English translations of SP 103/24. 18. (57, English) A letter from Parliament to the Council of State ordering Mylius' reception, signed by Scobell. 19. (61, Latin) A letter from Mylius to the Council of State, dated February 10, 1651, signed by him. He is complaining about the delay in approval for the Safeguard and asking for authority to return to Oldenburg. Sir Oliver Fleming is mentioned, but not Milton. 20. (76, Latin) A letter to Thurloe signed by the 1654 emissaries, Wolzogen and Gryphiander, dated March 16, 1654. 21. (78, English) A translation of 22 below. 22. (80-81, Latin) A letter from the emissaries to Cromwell, dated March 9, 1654, suggesting that since the Dutch War is coming to a close, the approval of the Safeguard should be forthcoming. Apparently they were having as much trouble as Mylius did. 23. (82-85, Latin) A letter to Cromwell, signed and sealed by the Count of Oldenburg, dated May 2, 1654, asking an audience for his son, Count Anthony. This is the letter Milton refers to in the first sentence of Prose , 65; Works , 45. It appears to be available here for the first time. 24. (86, English) A translation of 23 above. There follow several more documents arising from this mission, most of them communications between the emissaries and Thurloe. Comment: There are several aspects of this series of documents that excite interest. One wonders, first, why this relatively unimportant matter should be so well represented in the State Papers, where it has double and triple the number of documents on file than can be found for negotiations of far greater weight and moment, such as the treaties with France and Sweden. More pertinent to Milton, however, is the matter of handwriting. Oldenburg 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, &amp; 17, as has been noted, are all in the same secretarial hand. The important question is whose amanuensis was he, Mylius' or Milton's, for if he turns out to be Milton's, then there is reason to assume that Mr. Secretary was responsible for some of the translation. The evidence, unfortunately, can be argued both ways. The presence of a copy of "Bee it knowne" in the files would seem to indicate that this is Milton's amanuensis. This is a working paper, a draft prepared before February 11, when the reference to successors was scratched, and used after that date, presumably by Milton, to prepare a semi-final draft of the Safeguard in English. It would appear to be a translation of the Latin draft which Milton prepared on January 8, English copies of which Mylius requested of him on that date (French, III, 142). As such, it would have been prepared by Milton's amanuensis. On the other hand, at his audience on October 20 Mylius delivered his "credentials in autograph in both Latin and English copies" (French, III, 83), and these are surely Oldenburg 16 and 17. There is no indication that Milton did any of this work for him, nor is there any reason to believe that he was responsible for translating the documents left at his farewell audience (Oldenburg 5, 6, 9, and 10). Milton was ordered to prepare Mylius' authorization for departure, which has not been found (French III, 192). If the English version of this document could be located and if it proved to be in the same hand, then perhaps the matter might be settled. We have, therefore, in English archives, six copies of the Oldenburg Safeguard, three in Latin and three in English, reflecting various stages in the evolution of the document. These, along with the wealth of material from the PRO and other sources, give us a remarkably full account of the production of a paper with which Milton was intimately involved, and provide us with a vivid picture in microcosm of his activities as Secretary for Foreign Languages. Aside from the presence of a Latin and an English copy of the Safeguard in the file, the 1654 documents provide no evidence of Milton's involvement in the later negotiations. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the 1654 document, like the later version of the Duke of Holstein's Safeguard (see Holstein 3 &amp; 4), conformed closely in wording to the 1652 versions, and that its wording was in part Miltonic. It can only be suggested that, since the later document was to be based on the one that Milton had so laboriously negotiated in 1652, Thurloe would be very likely to have called upon the author of the original to assist in its preparation. Milton was certainly available, and still on the payroll.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holstein Although this document appears in the files of other nations, it seems best to treat it separately, since it presents some problems. It is really not too difficult to understand why this Safeguard has been overlooked for so long and, hence, was never included in Milton's State Letters. First, the most striking feature of the Holstein Safeguard is that in the 1652 version it is verbally identical to the Oldenburg Safeguard, and a major portion of the 1653 version is copied, word for word, from the earlier document. The second reason can be best illustrated by citing Masson's confusion. He notes the copy in Thurloe, I, 385-86 (4 below) and correctly names the addressee as "Lord Frederick, heir of Norway" (IV, 424), but he erroneously identifies the document as the Oldenburg Safeguard, calling it "out of place" chronologically in Thurloe. His error probably arises from the fact that among the many titles that Frederick laid claim to was one as " comes in Oldenburgh and Delmenhorst ." I am in no position to explain this coincidence at the moment, but I think it safe to say that when coupled with the similarity of language, it helps explain why three of the four copies available are incorrectly identified as the Oldenburg Safeguard. Works rejects Masson's suggestion twice (XIII, 633, and XVIII, 638). Prose makes no mention of it. ##1. Sp 103/3, Treaty Papers, Denmark, ff. 52-53, Latin, unsigned, undated, endorsed "Safe Guard for ye Duke of Holstein." This copy has portions underlined with marginal substitutions. As changed, it is verbally identical to the Oldenburg Safeguard, save for three or four brief phrases. Of particular interest is the fact that it was at some point in time used as a working paper to prepare a copy of the other document. For example, " et Consiliarum Hermannum M. " appears in the margin, to be inserted after " per Deputatum suum ." This copy was transcribed after February 11, 1652, when the final wording for the Oldenburg document was approved by the Council of State and the phrases " praesentes Literas patentas inspecturis " inserted. It is in the Denmark file because the Duke of Holstein, as " Haeres Norwegiae ," was a vassal of the King of Denmark. ##2. SP 103/24, Treaty Papers, German States, ff. 221-22, Latin, unsigned, undated (Oldenburg 3). This copy, which is part of the Oldenburg file, is verbally identical to 1 above, disregarding the marginal changes in the latter. It is treated, it appears, as a companion to Universis et Singulis (Oldenburg 1), as the two have the same coversheet, marked "Holsteen Oldenburgh." The folder in which the two appear has pencil entries on the cover made at a much more recent date. The entry incorrectly identifies this document as the Oldenburg Safeguard. ##3. Bodleian Library, Nalson MS, XVIII, 172, Latin, dated December 1, 1653, endorsed "The Parliament's Declaration in regard to ye trafficking of ye subjects of Oldenburgh [ sic ]." This copy is verbally identical to 1 &amp; 2 above, except for about ten lines of script. After the dissolution of the Rump in April, 1653, the Duke apparently requested a renewal of the agreement and, it seems, received this one from the Barebones Parliament. Oldenburg waited a month or two more and so could request a renewal from the Protectorate in March, 1654 (see Oldenburg 20-22). I suppose Holstein had to come back and start all over again. ##4. Thurloe, I, 385-86, unsigned, undated, incorrectly identified as "Letters of safe-conduct from the parliament to count Oldenburgh." Though not dated, the copy in Thurloe and the original in the Tanner MS (V, 192) both appear among papers of July and August, 1653. If one disregards the change in name, fully 90% of the text duplicates the wording of Universis et Singulis . It is close verbally to 3 above, for which it was probably a working paper. Comment: There is no question that these are Milton's words, the intriguing question is how much was he involved. Did he confer with the envoy from the Duke of Holstein, and when? Unfortunately, the Order Books of the Council of State make no reference to the Holstein Safeguard. Why is there a copy among the 1652 Oldenburg papers? Was he consulted in the preparation of the 1653 document? On the evidence of the two copies alone (1 &amp; 2 above) it is impossible to say which of the Safeguards came first, for each seems to have been used as a working paper for the other. Both copies of the Holstein document contain wording added to Oldenburg's by the Council of State on February 11, 1652, and we know from Mylius' Tagebuch that Milton went through a number of drafts before arriving at the final wording. On the other hand, a copy of the Holstein document was used by a scribe to prepare a copy of Oldenburg's. It is possible that they were composed simultaneously, since they seem to be so closely associated in the files. In SP 103/24, the two have the same cover sheet; and in Nalson, XVIII, copy 3 is cheek by jowl to "Bee it Knowne." A possible explanation, one which may account in part for the protracted negotiations with Mylius, is that the Council of State in 1651-52 was taking its time to evolve acceptable wording for a general Safeguard, one which would serve as a model for all such agreements. Milton's Universis et Singulis , with only name changes, may well be found in a number of the archives of the small German states of the 17th Century. There is no evidence that Milton was consulted in the preparation of the 1653 document (3 &amp; 4); but as in the case of the 1654 Oldenburg Safeguard, it seems reasonable that Thurloe would employ the man who was responsible for the composition of the agreement it was to be modeled on. The searching out of these papers took approximately three weeks work in the Public Record Office. If these are the fruits of such small effort, what may be expected of more extensive research! This is not to imply that one can hope to come upon some rich lode of papers lying, unnoticed for centuries, in a long neglected attic somewhere. This is too much to expect; some De Doctrina Christiana may indeed be stuffed away in the corner of a manorial garret, but such discoveries come centuries apart. The reality is that such a search involves making one's way through many musty pages of unrewarding manuscript to find a few isolated documents (I read in eager anticipation the four hundred-odd pages of the minutes of the Council of State in 1658, to find only a few stray references of interest). This report does have certain promising implications for Miltonists, however. First, there are surely more documents somewhere and, further, each new discovery reveals more about the life of the poet during those shadowy years. If nothing else, one must emerge from such a search with the conviction that at the moment we have only a superficial understanding of Milton's public service and that any effort to assess the scope of his duties must not be limited to a consideration solely of those papers of which he retained copies. He surely did more than that collection reveals. Such research can lead to new insights into his poetry, for ultimately, of course, it is the art that counts, not whether he wrote this letter or that. We find value in the chronicle of that experience if we feel that the events which those letters record had an impact on the poet's imagination. In recent years, scholars have scoured Milton's library for keys to his meaning, but might we not find as much wealth in the passage of his days? He was part of a revolution, a seeding-time of our era, two decades of tumult and bitter trial— a part of it , first as a concerned observer, later as a willing and active worker, and finally as a blinded symbol of the cause, struggling through his Defensios to stay in the mainstream of events, but forced by his infirmity to view the scene through his mind's eye. But he knew it all—the stilted facade of protocol, the subtle give and take of guarded debate, the careful wording and artful veiling of purpose, the uncertain ceremony of treaty and alliance, and finally the sudden sword of war. Paradise Lost took form in those years; Milton began his vast project during the death throes of the English Republic, as his dream of liberty faded. It is a time that cannot be dismissed. Scholars, in the final analysis, are but acolytes in the ceremony of creation, and as we watch those rites in our passion to understand, we dare not blink, lest we miss some fleeting gesture that shapes a part of the final achievement. We cannot discard any of it, for the poet's vision draws substance from all his days, from a book read, a melody heard, a painting seen, a death mourned, a dream denied—or from an obscure letter written.</field>

This file contains a lengthy extract from Christer Carlson Bonde's Diarum , September 28, 1654—September 30, 1658, the original of which is in the Royal Stockholm Museum. Bonde negotiated the Anglo-Swedish Treaty of 1656, Milton's involvement in which is the subject of some controversy ( Works , 170; Prose , 96). b. PRO 31/17/33 is a 439-page typewritten transcript of the minutes of Richard Cromwell's Council of State from September 3, 1658, to January 18, 1659. The original is in the possession of the Marquess of Bath, Longleat, Warminster, Wilts. This document was not available to Mary Anne Evans Green, editor of The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, Commonwealth , 13 vols. (Vaduz: Kraus Reprints, 1965), as noted in Vol. XII, p. xviii; nor can I find any modern scholars who refer to it. Indeed, it adds little specific information to our knowledge of Milton's Letters of State. In the entire document I could find reference to only one of them, Mitto ad Majestatem , Richard Cromwell to the King of Sweden, October 26 [?] 1658 ( Works , 128; Prose , 162). The Council considered the matter on Sept. 24 (p. 53 of the Order Book, p. 69 of the Transcript), Sept. 30 (p. 64, p. 83), Oct. 14 (pp. 89-90, p. 117), Oct. 15 (p. 92, p. 121), and Oct. 26 (p. 108, p. 140). It is a fascinating historical document, however. In the margins appear the names of individuals and agencies, "action officers" to whom each matter is referred for disposition. There is occasional mention of Marvell, but none of Milton. J.

      <field name="heading_text">Lawton Gilliver: Pope's Bookseller by James McLaverty</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Authorship in the Days of Johnson , Arthur Collins describes Pope as 'the pioneer of literature as an honourable and remunerative profession,' 1 one who helped establish a new alliance between author and bookseller. In this article I am concerned with one of the booksellers he dealt with, Lawton Gilliver, who worked for him from 1729 to 1738. It was an important period for Pope in two ways: it saw the publication of most of his major poems (the Dunciad , the Essay on Man , and the epistles Warburton called Moral Essays ); and it saw him encroaching on preserves that were usually the bookseller's. He sought maximum profit for his labours by selling his copyrights for short periods or by dealing directly with printers and distributors; and he controlled the presentation of his work to the public, even providing a context for his poems by promoting the work of his friends and protégés. Gilliver's career was dominated by his relations with Pope. Although he was a member of a Conger, Pope's poetry was the basis of his business, and it was through Pope that he became involved with other writers and enterprises. After he quarrelled with Pope over the profits of Works II (a quarrel which coincided with the break-up of the Conger), he concentrated on the retail side of his business; but he had little success and in 1742 he went bankrupt. I shall consider his career in five sections: apprenticeship; publishing for Pope; business connected with Pope; the Conger; retailing and bankruptcy. Gilliver came from Pilsley in Derbyshire. The Stationers' Register shows that he was bound apprentice to Jonah Bowyer on 6 March 1721: 'Lawton Gilliver Son of John late of Pilsey in the County of Derby Gentln. Deced. to Jonah Bowyer West End St. Paul's Bookseller. 7 Years. Cons. 80 li.' 2 The entry shows that Gilliver came from a good family (his father was a gentleman) which could afford the high premium of eighty pounds to have him bound to a prosperous London bookseller. I have found no record of Lawton Gilliver's birth in the Pilsley parish registers (in the custody of the Rector of North Wingfield), but it seems that the Gilliver family moved to Pilsley from Egginton in 1704, when Robert Gilliver, distinguished in the register by the prefix 'Mr,' moved there on his marriage to Rose More. The baptism of a Lawton Gilliver, son of Robert, is recorded in the register of Egginton Parish Church (at the Derbyshire County Record Office, Matlock) on 19 September 1703. This could be the man apprenticed to Bowyer: the name is unusual, the date of birth is appropriate, and the father may have been the man who moved to Pilsley. On the other hand, Lawton Gilliver's father is named John in the Stationers' Register, so the date of birth of Pope's bookseller must remain uncertain. Jonah Bowyer, Gilliver's master, had built up his business on the same lines as that of his master, Thomas Bennet. Bennet had been patronised by High Church Tories such as Atterbury, South, and Smalridge, and had even been involved on Boyle's side in the controversy with Richard Bentley—later Pope's butt—over the Letters of Phalaris . 3 Bowyer inherited much of this trade and, with Bennet's other former apprentice, Henry Clements, shared in the distribution of the books from the Oxford Press. Bowyer died, however, while Gilliver was still serving his time, and the name of his widow, Christiana, appears in the Stationers' Register when Gilliver is freed on 7 May 1728. I am not sure how much Gilliver benefited from his association with the Bowyers. Mrs. Bowyer carried on the business until 1737, but she shared only one copyright with Gilliver, that to William Burscough's Apostolical Decree in 1734. On the other hand, I have found Gilliver advertising Oxford books, George Hickes's Thesaurus (1705), Henry Maundrell's A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem (1732), Xenophon's Anabasis (1735), and Junius's Etymologicum Anglicanum (1743), and he probably got these through Mrs. Bowyer. More important perhaps were the contacts he made while working for the Bowyers: Joseph Trapp, for example, transferred his business to Gilliver. As R. H. Griffith noted in 1945, 4 Gilliver started to advertise books on his own account before he was officially freed. Entry 35 in the Monthly Catalogue for March 1728 reads: There is just Publish'd; No. 1. of the History of the Council of Constance. Written in French by James Lenfant. Done into English from the last edition printed at Amsterdam, 1727 . . . Printed for Thomas Cox at the Lamb, under the Piazza at the Royal Exchange; Thomas Astley at the Rose, Stephen Austen at the Angel, both in St. Paul's Church-yard; and Lawton Gilliver at Homer's Head over against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet-Street. As Gilliver actually finished his seven years as apprentice on 6 March 1728, he probably set up on his own account as soon as he could after that date, regardless of whether he was officially free. The advertisement shows that his shop was in Fleet Street. The records of the assessment for the land tax for the ward of Farringdon Without, the division of St. Dunstan's in the West (Guildhall Library MS 11,316/86), show that by 1728 he was occupying the premises between Faulcon Court and Hercules Pillars Alley which had been occupied the year before by Edward Watkins. David Foxon has suggested that the sign chosen for the shop, Homer's Head, is significant: Pope's fame at this time was as the translator of Homer and an engraving of Homer's head had appeared as a frontispiece to both the Iliad and the Odyssey ; 5 it seems unlikely that Gilliver chose this name by chance, and probable that Pope helped or encouraged him to open his shop. Pope was, after all, at this time without a bookseller (he had quarrelled with Bernard Lintot over the Odyssey and vowed never to employ him again), and we know that on other occasions he set up members of the book trade: he established Henry Woodfall as master of his own printingshop, 6 and gave Robert Dodsley one hundred pounds to begin a career as a bookseller. 7 It is not certain that either Gilliver or John Wright (the printer of the Dunciad Variorum , who also entered new premises in 1728) were established in their businesses by Pope, but there is a strong possibility that they were. The first publication which resulted from the alliance of Pope and Gilliver was the Dunciad Variorum . In many ways the problems it raised were typical of those found later in their relationship. Pope wanted his part in the work to be kept secret: he no longer minded its being known that he had written the poem, but the notes might be libellous, so every attempt had to be made to disguise his hand in them. There was a danger that the bookseller might be arrested and reveal the name of the author; thus it was better not to give him an assignment of the copyright and thereby claim responsibility for the work. At the same time, Pope obviously wanted to make as much profit from the venture as possible. Gilliver, on the other hand, must have been concerned with his own profits and would have wanted an assignment to protect his interests. He must have been worried on three counts by Pope's unwillingness to assign the copy to him openly. First, there was the possibility that Pope might decide not to sell him the copy at all (but, unless he sold it to some other bookseller, that would have been to Pope's disadvantage because he would have lost the lump sum payment and would have found it difficult to get the work distributed). Second, Pope might not allow him to distribute the first edition. Third, the work might be pirated and profit thereby lost. All this indicates a possible conflict of interest between author and bookseller. The story of the publication of the Dunciad is complicated but it has been traced with great lucidity by Professor James Sutherland in his edition of the poem 8 and in his article, 'The Dunciad of 1729,' M.L.R. , 31 (1936), 347-353. The evidence about the episode lies chiefly in Pope's correspondence and in two law suits: the first brought by Gilliver against James Watson, Thomas Astley, John Clarke, and John Stagg in 1729 to prevent them selling the 'Dob' edition of the Dunciad Variorum , and the second by Pope in 1743 to restrain Henry Lintot from selling his edition of the Dunciad . The chief difficulty is in discovering when Gilliver came to hold the copyright of the poem and when he was promised by Pope that he should have it. If Pope did set him up in business, there may have been an understanding from then on; but four different dates are offered for ownership of the copyright: December 1728, 31 March 1729, 12 April 1729, and 21 November 1729, and I shall look at them in turn. December 1728 . When Pope brought his suit against Lintot in 1743 he asserted that Gilliver's right to the copy (which had subsequently passed to Lintot) had expired in December 1742. This meant Pope was claiming that he had sold the copy in December 1728. There is no evidence to support this, and it is clear that Pope had earlier been very uncertain about when he had disposed of the copyright. 9 31 March 1729 . When Gilliver brought his suit against Stagg and the others on 6 May 1729 he claimed that he had acquired the copyright on or about 31 March, and that Stagg's edition was piratical. Stagg denied it, saying that he had bought copies at five shillings each on 7 or 8 April and that Gilliver, who had bought some at the same price and made no claim to the copy, had asked him to keep the price to the trade at six shillings. It seems that Gilliver had a number of copies to wholesale (and, therefore, enjoyed some special status) but that copies had been released to the trade by someone else, probably Lord Bathurst ( Correspondence , III, 31). 12 April 1729 . Gilliver advertised the poem in the Daily Post on 10 April as 'Printed for Lawton Gilliver,' and on 12 April entered the poem in the Stationers' Register. This confirms one's impression that Gilliver had come to an agreement for the copyright of the poem by some time around the end of March at the latest; all his behaviour points to such an agreement. But Pope's name is not mentioned in the Register and it seems most unlikely that Gilliver had actually been given an assignment. When Gilliver's octavo edition appeared with his name on the imprint on 17 April and there was danger of action from the dunces, Pope seems to have persuaded Lords Oxford, Bathurst, and Burlington to accept responsibility for the edition. On 26 April, Gilliver's neighbour, Thomas Wotton, tells us, Gilliver denied that he had an assignment but said he should have one in a little time; yet on 6 May Gilliver entered his writ against Stagg. Arbuthnot tells us the consequences: 'Mr Pope is well. he had gott an injunction in chancery against the printers who had pyrated his dunciad; it was dissolv'd again because the printer could not prove any property nor did the Author appear' ( Correspondence , III, 36-37). 21 November 1729 . This is the date of Gilliver's second entry of the poem in the Stationers' Register. Pope had explained to Burlington in a letter of 29 October ( Correspondence , III, 61) that Gilliver was refusing to publish the new edition until he could show that he had a right to the property. The Lords now signed a document conveying the copyright to Gilliver. It seems most likely that Pope promised Gilliver the copyright of the Dunciad Variorum some time in 1728 (almost certainly by March 1729) but refused to give him an assignment until 21 November 1729. In this way Pope protected himself and Gilliver, but Gilliver lost some profit from the distribution of the first edition, and through the 'Dob' piracy. In view of this, the hundred pounds he paid for the copyright of the poem was a high price; but that seems typical of the relations between him and Pope. The impression that Pope was the stronger party in his relations with Gilliver is confirmed by an agreement they made about Pope's essays and epistles on 1 December 1732. 10 Pope planned the publication of the Dunciad very carefully, and the signs are that he took equal care over Works II and the essays and epistles which went into it. The first new poem to appear after the Dunciad Variorum was the Epistle to Burlington , later Of False Taste . It was published by Gilliver on 14 December 1731 and Griffith says that it 'begins the long series of pieces by Pope which were published first in a Large Paper folio format.' 11 The evidence is that Pope himself conceived of them as a series: his agreement with Gilliver begins, 'Whereas the said Alexander Pope intends to publish certain Poems or Epistles,' and goes on to deal with the way they are to be published. The agreement favours the poet. Gilliver was to arrange for the printing and publication of all the poems which were offered to him; he was to enter them in the Stationers' Register to secure the copyright for himself and, later, Pope; and he was to pay fifty pounds for each poem, receiving in return the copyright for one year only. At the end of the year Gilliver was to make over the copyright to Pope or his nominee and, it seems, stop selling the poem as well. Pope was not committed to offering each poem to Gilliver first, and there was nothing to stop him selling it to another bookseller at the end of the year. Gilliver's profits from these arrangements cannot have been large. Lintot paid only £32 5s. for Windsor Forest in 1713, and he was acquiring the rights for fourteen years. Gilliver must have relied on heavy demand for the folio editions printed in the first year to make the enterprise worth while. It would be wrong, however, to look at this agreement in isolation: the publication of the essays and epistles was probably seen by both Pope and Gilliver as a prelude to Works II which came out in 1735. In the British Library there is an undated declaration by Pope which makes this clear. 12 Pope says that in the event of his death he wants his executors to arrange that 'Mr. Gilliver may have the Refusal of all such Epistles as I leave fit for the Press, in order to publish them all together with what were before printed, and with the Dunciad.' If Gilliver does not buy the perpetuity of the epistles, Pope says, whoever does so should agree to have them printed so they can be bound with the other material in one volume. Pope doubtless made this declaration with a view to his stature as a poet: he wanted Works II to appear even if he should die before it was completed. We can see now, too, why Pope sold the epistles to Gilliver for one year only: by the time Works II came out he owned the copyright to most of the material in it outside the Dunciad and he and Gilliver held half of the copy each. From Gilliver's point of view the declaration was reassuring. He had a valuable property in the Dunciad , which would be a major part of any collected works, and he could expect a considerable profit from such a venture. The agreement for the epistles was worth while in view of the collected works which was to come from them. R. W. Rogers (p. 118) prints a list of the essays and epistles which Gilliver received as a result of his agreement with Pope: Of the Use of Riches , First Satire of the Second Book of Horace , Essay on Man , Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men , Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot , and Epistle to a Lady . The Essay on Man is a special case because it was entered in the Stationers' Register not by Gilliver but by John Wilford (on 10 March 1733); it is worth pausing to consider it. Professor Maynard Mack points out that the anonymous publication of the Essay on Man was all the more effective because 'between January 1733 and January 1734, Pope issued through his regular booksellers three important poems bearing his name' ( Twickenham Pope , III, i, xv). The relationship between Pope, Gilliver, and John Wright was so well established that critics would not expect Pope's poems to be published from another quarter. I suspect that Wilford was chosen to be the ostensible publisher of the poem because of his connection with Gilliver through the Grubstreet Journal . Gilliver had been involved with the Journal from the start and I shall deal with his role in it later; Wilford had obtained shares in the Journal by 7 September 1732 and became increasingly important, taking over as publisher on 3 July 1735. Confirmation that this was the link between Wilford and the Essay on Man seems to come from identification of John Huggonson as the first printer of the poem (Griffith 294, the first appearance of any part). Huggonson had held a share in the Journal from the time the records begin and he became its printer in October 1733. Both men must have been well-known to Gilliver; they may have been known to Pope as well. The first sign of deterioration in the relations between Pope and Gilliver comes with the publication of the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot and the Epistle to a Lady . In a letter to Oxford on 30 December 1734 Pope says that he had hoped 'to have had Interest enough with my negligent Bookseller to have procur'd a Copy of the Epistle to Dr. A. to accompany my Letter. I doubt whether I shall do it yet?' ( Correspondence , III, 446). Gilliver cannot have been as anxious to please as the poet wished; he seems to have been reluctant to give pre-publication copies and Pope explains to Caryll in a letter of 8 February 1735 that he has delayed posting for a fortnight because he intended to send a copy of the Epistle to a Lady with the letter ( Correspondence , III, 450). These small annoyances to Pope were, however, nothing compared with Gilliver's offence over Works II . The entry in the Stationers' Register, made by John Wright, shows that the copyright was to be divided equally between Pope and Gilliver. Gilliver had the rights to the Dunciad and, at the time of entry, 11 April 1735, he also held the rights to the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot and Epistle to a Lady , though these would expire in a few months. Pope held the copyright to the rest of the material. As a result of this arrangement Pope had to pay for the printing of half the edition and dispose of half the copies himself. In fact all the expenditure at that time was probably his, because the British Library declaration tells us that Gilliver already had copies of the Dunciad in quarto and folio 'lying by.' The obvious way for Pope to dispose of his copies was through his bookseller, Gilliver, but that is not what happened. On 9 April 1735 we find Pope writing to Samuel Buckley: It was meerly an Unwillingness to give you Trouble, that hinderd my doing myself the Service of desiring your Assistance in printing this book [ Works II ]. As it is, it has cost me dear, &amp; may dearer, if I am to depend on my Bookseller for the Reimbursement. If it lye in your way to help me off with 150 of them, (which are not to be sold to the Trade at less than 18s or to Gentlemen than a Guinea) it would be a Service to me, a Bookseller having had the Conscience to offer me 13s a piece, &amp; being modestly content to get 8s in the pound himself, after I have done him many services. Another, quite a Stranger, has taken 100 at 17s but I want to part with the rest ( Correspondence , III, 454). Gilliver is surely 'my Bookseller' and the man who has been favoured by Pope but has offered only thirteen shillings. The other man, offering seventeen, could be Brindley or Dodsley. Another letter shows that at that time Dodsley stood high in Pope's estimation; he tells William Duncombe that Dodsley had 'just set up a Bookseller' and suggests that 'as he has more Sense, so will have more Honesty, than most of that Profession ( Correspondence , III, 454). Pope had probably come to feel that Gilliver was not honest; he had just given Dodsley one hundred pounds to help him start his business, and Dodsley was shortly to take Gilliver's place as Pope's bookseller. The comparison Pope makes between the offer of 13s. (Gilliver's) and that of 17s. is unfair and tells us something about Pope's attitude to the book trade. Gilliver was, like most of his London colleagues, a retailer and a wholesaler, and he must have made his offer in his capacity as a wholesaler (after all, he had half the edition to dispose of already). The other bookseller must have hoped to retail a good proportion of his copies himself. At the simplest level a book had three prices: the price of paper and printing which was paid to the printer, the price at which the book was sold to the trade, and the price at which it was retailed. Hodgson and Blagden (p. 73) say that 'it was the trade price from which the retail price was calculated, the latter being in a large number of cases a third more than the former'; Dr. Johnson tells us that a profit of ten per cent was expected in the wholesale trade. 13 If we take these profit margins as the norm and accept that Works II was to retail at 21s., we can see that the price the wholesaler would expect to pay would be 14s. 4d., and the retailer would expect to pay 15s. 9d.. The terms Pope insists on cut down the margin of profit for both wholesaler and retailer: the wholesaler would have made a profit of less than six per cent rather than ten; the retailer would have made a profit of one sixth rather than the third Blagden suggests. The price Gilliver offered, 13s., was low, but the difference between him and Pope did not spring from Gilliver's attempt to gain a little extra profit: Pope wanted 17s. a copy not 14s. 4d. and he does not seem to have given much regard to the usual arrangements in the book trade. He was aware that by marketing his products in the usual way he was paying for services which might be dispensed with and was accepting a smaller share in the profits than he might have had. One way of tackling the problem was to deal with inexperienced men like Gilliver and Dodsley who might allow more money to the author: when Gilliver paid Pope fifty pounds for each of his epistles for one year only, he must have realised that he would not only be confined to a small profit himself, but would also have to offer the works to the trade at a price which would leave less profit than usual; similarly, the Dunciad Variorum was offered to retailers at 6s. but was expected to sell at 6s. 6d.. Works II was the next step in the process: Pope had already obtained large payments for the copyright to several of the poems, but the rights had reverted to him; as a result he paid for the printing of half the edition and found himself in a position of a bookseller selling to the trade. Gilliver had refused to act as wholesaler on the terms Pope wanted; hence, as the letter to Buckley shows, Pope began to act as wholesaler himself. He seems to have met with some success, for Griffith (II, 282) says that by 13 May advertisements for Works II were carrying the names of Gilliver, Dodsley, Brindley, J. J. and P. Knapton, J. and J. Brotherton, and W. Meadows. Gilliver's refusal to play the role allotted to him on this occasion seems to have lost him his position as Pope's bookseller. His name continued to appear on the title-page of collections he had a share in (notably the relevant volumes of the octavo Works published in co-operation with Henry Lintot), but he obtained no more copyrights from Pope and his name appears on the title-page of only two new Pope works. The first and more important of these was Letters of Mr. Alexander Pope, and Several of his Friends , published on 19 May 1737. The story of the publication of Pope's letters is well-known, 14 and it is not necessary to consider it all here. Gilliver seems to have been involved from the earliest stage, the publication of the letters in the Posthumous Works of William Wycherley II in 1729. When Pope tricked Curll into publishing an edition of the letters in 1735, the sheets he sent him included some from the 1729 work; Curll told his readers: The plot is now discover'd: Lawton Gilliver has declared that you bought of him the Remainder of the Impression of Wycherley's Letters, which he printed, by your Direction, in 1728, and have printed Six hundred of the additional Letters, with those to Mr. Cromwell, to make up the Volume. 15 Gilliver's early involvement probably meant that his name had to appear in connection with subsequent editions, and he certainly had some interest in the 1735 edition (entered in the Register by Cooper), because Pope intended to use him as his agent in an attempt to seize Curll's volumes ( Correspondence , III, 472-473). Gilliver's disclosure about the Wycherley letters can only have lowered him further in Pope's esteem at a time when there was already disagreement about Works II , and the entry of the authorised edition of the Letters in 1737 was made by Dodsley. It seems Gilliver was still loyal to Pope at this time, for he told him about Jacob Robinson's attempt to sell him James Watson's piracy of the authorised edition ( Correspondence , IV, 87). The second new work after 1735 to bear Gilliver's name was the Sixth Epistle of the First Book of Horace , which was entered to Pope himself in the Stationers' Register on 14 January 1738, with the additional note, 'Be it remembered that I Alexander Pope have authorised Lawton Gilliver to Print and Publish an Edition in folio and Quarto of the said Epistle, being the first Edition thereof.' This was probably the result of an agreement similar to that for the epistles for Works II ; Pope was to control subsequent editions of the poem. Contact between Pope and Gilliver after this publication seems to have been slight. The remaining connection between them was Gilliver's ownership of the Dunciad copyright. Eventually he acted against Pope's interests by selling the copy so that it fell into the hands of Henry Lintot. Howard Vincent explains that Gilliver first offered the copy, to Thomas Cooper, in the middle of 1739: 'Cooper, seeing the copyright grant had but few of the fourteen years yet to run, declined the opportunity, but some time before August of that year Gilliver sold one-third of the rights to a printer, J. Clarke. For no stated reason Clarke on August 23 resold his share to John Osborne, bookseller, who in turn passed it on to Henry Lintot, January 18, 1739/40. Lintot later purchased the rest of the right. . . .' 16 Lintot was thus able to bring out an edition of the Dunciad at a time when Pope was planning an edition of his own, containing Book IV; it was in his action to prevent Lintot selling his edition that Pope claimed Gilliver's copyright had expired in December 1742. Gilliver, then, takes his place in the story of Pope's relations with the book trade as the bookseller for the Dunciad and the epistles which went into the 1735 Works , a man who was at first willing to allow Pope more profit than he could have obtained elsewhere, but later resisted and was replaced. But Pope's patronage meant more to Gilliver than the profit he could make from selling his poetry: much of his business seems to have been based on his connection with Pope. A glance at a list of authors whose books were published by Gilliver will show that many of them were allies of Pope in some way. Some, such as Lyttelton and West, seem to have been personal friends, others shared his contempt for the dunces or his political and social attitudes. I shall begin the discussion of this side of Gilliver's business with a consideration of the Dunciad controversy and the Grubstreet Journal , and then go on to consider his publication of other minor poets and his work for Swift. The Dunciad Variorum was greeted by a barrage of pamphlets attacking Pope, an attack which continued into 1730 and 1731. 17 Pope was not the man to leave these attacks unanswered, but it was obviously to his advantage if he could remain aloof and leave the reply to others. Gilliver must have been happy to see battle engaged: he had published a controversial poem, and the longer the controversy raged the more it would sell. He must also have hoped to profit by publishing works supporting Pope. As a result, there was a campaign in support of Pope; it had two parts, individual poems and the Grubstreet Journal . It seems that the poems in Pope's defence did not sell well, because Gilliver eventually collected the unsold sheets to form A Collection of Pieces in Verse and Prose, Which Have Been Publish'd on Occasion of the Dunciad . The content of the Collection seems to have varied some-what, but the poems usually included were: Two Epistles to Mr. Pope, Concerning the Authors of the Age by Edward Young; An Essay on Satire; Particularly on the Dunciad by Walter Harte; Harlequin-Horace or, the Art of Modern Poetry by James Miller; An Epistle to Mr Pope from a Young Gentleman at Rome by George Lyttelton; An Author to be Let by Richard Savage; Certain Epigrams ; and Essays, Letters . . . . The Collection is preceded by a dedication to the Earl of Middlesex which bears the name of Richard Savage. James Sutherland ( Twickenham Pope , V, xxv-xxvii) suggests that a lot of Pope's contact with the London literary scene was through Savage, who was widely believed to have been the chief source of information for the Dunciad Variorum . Little correspondence between the two survives, but we do find that Savage knew Gilliver and that he occasionally sent Pope information about Gilliver's authors ( Correspondence , III, 66, 170, 232, 238). The Collection would seem, therefore, to be the joint production of Pope's two London agents; but Johnson tells us that the dedication was written by Pope ( Lives of the Poets , III, 147) and that Savage 'was prevailed upon to sign, though he did not write it' ( Lives , II, 360). If Pope was responsible for the dedication, we have some indication of his involvement in this side of Gilliver's activities. The wider question of responsibility for the publication of the poems remains: for example, did the authors send them to Gilliver to be published, or to Pope? In one case we know the poem reached Pope first. George Lyttelton sent his Epistle to Mr Pope to his father with the request, If you like the inclosed verses, I desire you would give them to Mr. Pope, to whom I have taken the liberty to address them. They contain a good piece of advice; and I hope it is given in a manner that will make it acceptable. 18 The poem was printed by John Wright and appeared with the imprint, 'printed for J. Roberts,' but, as it is included in Gilliver's Collection , it was probably really published by him. It is possible that other poems may have come to Gilliver in this way. In a letter to Caryll of 6 February 1731, Pope shows a close knowledge of Gilliver's publications, and reveals that he had seen another poem, the Art of Politicks , in manuscript. Caryll had asked him for his opinion of Mount Caburn , but Pope recommended Gilliver's authors instead: The Art of Politicks [by James Bramston] is pretty, I saw it before 'twas printed. There is just now come out another imitation of the same original, Harlequin Horace [by James Miller]: which has a good deal of humour. There is also a poem upon satire writ by Mr Harte of Oxford, a very valuable young man, but it compliments me too much: both printed for L. Gilliver in Fleet street . . . I've seen nothing of Swift's of late, but Pandora , which I take to be his, in the Grub Street Journal . That paper would often divert you, tho' 'tis very unequal ( Correspondence , III, 173). Pope knew of Gilliver's activities and approved of them—he seems to be advertising the works to Caryll—and it is possible that he supplied the material for the campaign. A more important element in that campaign than the Collection was the Grubstreet Journal . The qualified praise of the Journal in the letter to Caryll is not any proof of Pope's involvement in it, but it probably shows that it was a part of Gilliver's business known to Pope and approved by him. Discussions of Pope's relations with the Journal have been hampered by neglect of Gilliver's role in the venture and of the Journal 's link with the rest of the pro-Pope campaign. There has been a wide range of views. At one extreme we find Courthope, who believed that Pope had started the Journal , reviving the Scriblerus project, 'The works of the unlearned.' 19 J. T. Hillhouse, in his book The Grub-street Journal (1928), p. v, adopted a more moderate view, saying that it was impossible to show that Pope was the Journal 's originator, or to know what he had to do with it after it got underway. He thought that it later became quite independent of Pope. Even this conclusion was rejected, however, by George Sherburn in his review of Hillhouse's book: To the present reviewer it seems obvious either ( a ) that Pope supervised and contributed to the Journal , or ( b ) that the editors tried unwarrantably to make the public believe that Pope was sponsoring their efforts. The first of these alternatives seems hardly possible; the second seems probable. 20 Sherburn ignores powerful evidence against his alternative (b), in, for example, the account of Mrs. Pope's death which appears in No. 181 and seems to have been written by the poet; but one can see why he thinks positing some vague connection with the Journal is unsatisfactory. Richard Russel, for most of its years the Journal 's editor, gives a long and ambiguous discussion of Pope's relationship with the periodical in Memoirs of the Society of Grub-street , pp. xxvii-xxviii, and then declares that the editors had done justice to 'this Gentleman and his particular friends, in relation to the few Pieces imagined to come from their hand, which are distinguished by the letter A . . .' One's first reaction is the same as Sherburn's: either Pope and his friends had written the pieces or Russel was trying to deceive the reader into thinking they had. But I think there is a possibility that Russel was being honest and did not know himself who had written them; he may have got them from Gilliver. The minute book of the partners in the Grubstreet Journal , in the library of the Queen's College, Oxford, shows that at the first recorded meeting on 28 August 1730 (the first number of the Journal is dated 8 January 1730) the shares were distributed like this: F. Cogan, S. Palmer, J. Brotherton and W. Bickerton one share each J. Huggonson two shares L. Gilliver six shares 21 Gilliver was the Journal 's leading figure: he possessed half the shares; he had been the treasurer for the first six months of its existence; the articles signed at the setting up of the paper were in his possession; and it was his duty to correct the press. So Pope was at least indirectly connected with the Journal through his bookseller; the first editor, according to Johnson, was to be Savage, but he declined ( Lives , II, 360, n. 2). The connection of these two figures with the Journal points to its starting with Pope's blessing, and there is evidence in the minute book which suggests Pope may have had a continued influence on the Journal . At the meeting of 25 June 1731, we find Gilliver acknowledging that he has 'Receiv'd at the Same Time Two Guineas for my Own share &amp; 4 Guineas for D. M. &amp; another.' D. M. is perhaps Doctor Martyn, Russel's co-editor, but we do not know the identity of the other man. It was someone who knew Gilliver better than he did the other partners, and who wished to keep his identity secret. Pope might well have been such a man. A more significant entry is to be found on 4 August 1737. At that time the partners were looking back over past expenditure in an attempt to recover some of their losses. They recommended: That Mr. Gilliver do represent, in the strongest terms, to the Gentleman who in-couraged the publishing of the Advertisements against Jemmy More Smith, the expenses of the Law-suit occasion'd thereby. The partners obviously considered the encouragement to have had sufficient weight with them as to give the gentleman the moral responsibility of recompensing them. Pope was at that time still in contact with Gilliver and, of course, his animus towards More-Smythe is well-documented. 22 It is difficult to believe the Gentleman was anyone but him. Of course, Pope did deny having a hand in the Grubstreet Journal , or seemed to deny it. In the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot , he included the following note on the line, 'Let Budgel charge low Grubstreet on his quill': Budgell in a Weekly Pamphlet call'd the Bee , bestow'd much abuse on him, in the imagination that he writ some things about the Last Will of Dr. Tindal , in the Grubstreet Journal : a Paper wherein he never had the least Hand, Direction , or Supervisal , nor the least knowledge of its author ( Twickenham Pope , IV, 124). This is not a very clear denial: 'Paper' may mean the specific essay rather than the Journal as a whole, and 'author' suggests it is right to read the note in this way. But even if we do not regard the denial as conclusive, we have no evidence that Pope was involved in the way contemporaries such as Curll 23 and Burnet 24 believed he was. We are, however, in a position to make an informed guess about his involvement and about Russel's ambiguous discussion of the question in the Memoirs of the Society of Grub-street . If Pope founded and influenced the Journal , he surely did so through Gilliver; there was no need for him to take risks when he had an agent to act for him. Russel was probably in genuine doubt about the pieces marked 'A': he thought they were by Pope or his friends, but he did not know, because he had been given them, not directly by Pope, but by Gilliver. The Journal was doubtless at first profitable and useful to Gilliver, and his connection with it was soon made public. No. 15 of the Journal , for 16 April 1730, reports that there had been an election for the position of bookseller to the Grubstreet Society. Only two candidates present themselves, Kirleus (Curll) and A person, who, tho' very famous in the world, yet made no great figure in the trade, having been but newly set up. This Person was Captain L. Gulliver, who by the advice of some friends at Dublin, and the incouragement of some copies sent from thence [the Dunciad ?] had lately moved from Redriff, and opened a shop near Temple-bar. Captain Gulliver is, as one might expect, elected, and from that issue onwards his name appears in the Journal 's imprint. Although he appears as the Journal 's representative in some of its quarrels (with Henley, for example), there is not much sign that Gilliver greatly influenced the content of the paper; the day-to-day policy was probably left to the editor, Richard Russel, a non-juring clergyman connected with Westminster School. Gilliver's relations with him seem to have been good, for on 3 June 1735, Russel's eldest son, William, was bound apprentice to him for fifty pounds. The Grubstreet Journal leads us to consider the rest of Gilliver's business because it gave him the opportunity to advertise, and sometimes to 'puff' his own publications. Walter Harte and James Miller are, for example, praised at some length, and others whose works are commended or defended include Henry Carey, David Mallet, and Joseph Trapp. The advertisements are valuable in giving us some idea of the range of Gilliver's publications, but what is most interesting is how often these publications are connected directly or indirectly with Pope. The most striking cases in this area of Gilliver's business are those where Pope directly provided Gilliver with material for publication. We have already noted one example of this, Lyttelton's Epistle to Mr Pope , and we find another in the same author's Progress of Love . Pope wrote to Tonson on 14 November 1731, 'I have a very pretty Poem to show you of a near Relation of Lord Cobhams, which he has inscribed to me &amp; some others' ( Correspondence , III, 244). He must have given the poem to Gilliver, who published it in March 1732. Harte's Essay on Reason seems a similar case, though this time Pope was much more thoroughly involved (Warton tells us that 'Pope inserted many good lines in Harte's 'Essay on Reason'). 25 A letter to Mallet makes it clear that Pope was not only encouraging work to which he was sympathetic; he was quite content that it should be taken for his own: Pray tell Mr Harte I have given Gilliver his Poem to print, but whether he would chuse to publish it now, or next winter, let himself judge. I undertook to correct the press, but find myself so bad a Reviser by what I see has escaped me in my last thing, that I believe he had best have it sent to him to Oxford . . . I fancy the Title of an Essay on Reason is the best, &amp; am half of opinion, if no Name be set to it, the public will think it mine especially since in the Index, (annext to the larger paper Edition of the Essay on Man) the Subject of the next Epistle is mentioned to be of Human Reason &amp;c. But whether this may be an Inducement, or the Contrary, to Mr Harte, I know not: I like his poem so well (especially since his last alterations) that it would no way displease me ( Correspondence , III, 408-409). Gilliver also published Aaron Hill's Athelwold through Pope's influence. Pope made some suggestions to Hill about the play and later recommended Gilliver to him as a bookseller: '. . . this Man I really think honest, and capable in his Business' ( Correspondence , III, 238). These are the only works that we know came to Gilliver from Pope, but several others were seen by the poet before publication and this is strange in itself. Either the writers were sending their work to Pope, who passed it on to Gilliver, or Gilliver was sending material to Pope to be inspected, and perhaps corrected; in either case, Pope was taking an unusual role in the business. We have already noted that Bramston's Art of Politicks was seen by Pope 'before 'twas printed,' the same seems to be true of George Jeffreys' Father Francis and Sister Constance . Jeffreys talks in his preface of the blemishes which have been removed 'upon the authority of so unquestion'd a Judge and Master.' Henry Brooke was similarly grateful: '. . . I wanted to thank you once for all, for much good you have done me, and more particularly for revising and passing your friendly judgment upon some lines of mine that, indeed, were scarcely worth your reading' ( Correspondence , IV, 198). David Mallet, on the other hand, seems to want to deny Pope's involvement in his Of Verbal Criticism , telling us that 'this Poem was undertaken and written entirely without the knowledge of the gentleman to whom it is addressed.' But it is clear from the Correspondence that it is very like the others. Pope wrote to Mallet: 'The Epistle I have read over &amp; over, with great &amp; just Delight; I think it correct throughout, except one or two small things that savor of Repetition toward the latter End' (III, 330). One wonders whether Pope was able to leave the 'small things' alone. D.N.B. (XII, 871) may be naive in saying, 'At times his lines show the cadence of Pope's verse (e.g. 'Verbal Criticism').' There is indeed a similarity in theme and style between Pope's work and that of several of Gilliver's authors. This must partly be a result of the imitation of a great writer by his contemporaries, but it could also be the result of some form of collaboration. If Pope corrected the work of Gilliver's poets and sometimes added to it, one could easily explain the way in which he echoes it in some of his verse. For example, Peter Dixon has noted that the Essay on Man 's Form'd by thy converse, happily to steer From grave to gay, from lively to severe . . . seems to have been indebted to Harlequin-Horace 's Consult no Order, but for ever steer From grave to gay, from florid to severe . . . 26 And there is a striking similarity between Dunciad IV 's discussion of those who Shine in the dignity of F. R. S. Some, deep Free-masons, join the silent race . . . and a passage in Bramston's earlier Man of Taste , Next lodge I'll be Free-mason, nothing less, Unless I happen to be F. R. S. 27 There are many examples of this sort of thing noted by the Twickenham editors, 28 and they at least confirm that Pope knew some of Gilliver's publications very well. In addition to those already mentioned, so many of Gilliver's authors (Burscough, Young, Dodsley, Lockman, Brownsword) had connections with Pope, that it must be acknowledged that Gilliver's business in copyrights was based on his contact with Pope. It seems too that Pope spent sufficient time correcting others' work to justify his complaints in the first seventy lines of the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot . Pope obtained little work for Gilliver from his most distinguished ally, Swift. The Grubstreet Journal , No. 15, suggests by the use of the name 'Captain Gulliver' and references to 'friends at Dublin' that Gilliver was indeed guilty of 'bringing to light the works of our most inveterate enemies, Pope, Swift &amp;c.' But Gilliver published only Miscellanies, An Epistle to a Lady , and A Libel on Dr. D---ny . Two of these, Miscellanies . The Third Volume and An Epistle to a Lady , caused him considerable difficulty; in both cases Matthew Pilkington and Benjamin Motte were involved. The case of the Miscellanies shows Pope torn between his liking for involvement in the book trade (devising profit-making ventures, controlling the publication of literary works) and his sense of his position as a major writer, above the fray of business. Benjamin Motte had published the first three volumes of Swift-Pope miscellanies (the first, second, and 'last' volumes); but in May 1729 he still owed Pope £25 for the 'last' volume, and he came to an agreement with him by which the debt was cancelled but Motte lost his rights to the next volume of miscellanies. 29 The agreement was finalised on 1 July 1729. At that time Gilliver was emerging as Pope's bookseller, and it was probably Pope's influence which led to Gilliver's name appearing on the title-page of the reprinted volumes in October 1730. When it came to a new volume, Miscellanies . The Third Volume , Pope sold the copyright to Gilliver, probably some time early in 1732. At this point, however, Motte decided he wanted to be involved in the project after all. He appealed to Swift, who supported his claim to be bookseller, and Pope had little choice but to give way: Had I had the least thought you would have now desired what you before so deliberately refused, I would certainly have preferrd you to any other Bookseller. All I could now do was to speak to Mr Gilliver as you requested, to give you the share you would have in the Property, &amp; to set aside my obligation &amp; Covenant with him so far, to gratify the Dean &amp; yourself. You cannot object I think with any Reason to the Terms which he pays, &amp; which at the first word he agreed to ( Correspondence , III, 306). Doubtless Gilliver's willingness to pay Pope's terms at the first word was one of the factors which placed him high in the poet's favour. The affair was not concluded there, because of an intervention by Matthew Pilkington. Swift did not usually claim copyright in his controversial works, but on 22 July 1732 he made a sort of assignment of the Miscellanies material to Pilkington, who then sold the rights to Bowyer 'for a valuable consideration.' The two men then claimed the pieces which Pope had intended for Miscellanies . The Third Volume . Pope was angry. 'Surely I should be a properer person to trust the distribution of his works with than to a common bookseller,' 30 but he tried to come to an agreement with Bowyer by which Bowyer should have the serious or political pieces only. When Bowyer refused his compromise, he retired from the fray: 'I find he [Bowyer] is a true Bookseller, &amp; therfore shall leave it to himself &amp; Gilliver. . . . Since he has no other Sense of my complying with his Plea, than to suppose he is arguing with me instead of Gilliver, pray assure him I will not take upon me to limit his Pretentions or to enlarge them, but leave the matter between the Booksellers . . .' ( Correspondence , III, 324). Gilliver must have had some success because the volume appeared on 4 October 1732, 'printed for Benjamin Motte . . . and Lawton Gilliver.' The difficulties over An Epistle to a Lady Who Desired the Author to Make Verses on Her, in the Heroick Style were of a different kind: the poem offended the government. In August 1733, Mary Barber had come from Dublin to London with a number of Swift's poems and asked Pilkington to arrange for their publication. Pilkington first offered them to Motte, but Motte refused to publish the Epistle to a Lady , probably suggesting Gilliver instead, and making the arrangements with him himself. The poem was published in November 1733, and on 11 December Harrington sent a copy of the poem to the Attorney General with a request that he consider prosecution (P.R.O. SP 44/88, p. 123). On Friday, 11 January, John Wilford, whose name appeared on the title-page, was arrested; he was at most the distributor, and it seems likely Gilliver was using him as a front (as he did for the Essay on Man ). He must have given information, because on Wednesday, 16 January, the printer, Samuel Aris, was arrested, and the following Monday, 21 January, Gilliver was taken into custody. He was released the following day and a short period of inactivity ensued; but on Wednesday, 30 January, Mary Barber was taken into custody on the information of Matthew Pilkington. Pilkington was widely blamed for betraying Swift, but all those involved seem to have blamed one another. In a letter to Swift, Motte is very critical of Gilliver's conduct. He explains that Gilliver was arrested before he (Motte) could adequately advise him: The consequence was, he was examined, and made a confession, like poor Dr. Yalden 's, of all that he knew, and more too, naming Mr. Pilkington first and then myself; which last, as many people have told me, was unnecessary: only, as he before said, he was resolved, if he came into trouble, I should have a share of it, though I offered, in case he would not name me, that I would bear one half of his expences. This confession of his, together with his bearing the character of a wealthy man, exposed him to an information; but as it was not my business to be industrious in recollecting what past three months before, I could not remember any thing that could affect me or any body else. 31 Motte must have been more involved, at least in selling the copy to Gilliver, than he admits here, or he would not have offered to bear half Gilliver's expenses. Nevertheless, Gilliver seems to have acted in a way likely to make him unpopular, giving more information than was necessary, through, Motte suggests, hostility to his partners in the enterprise. It is interesting that Motte says Gilliver bore the character of a wealthy man; at this stage in his career, with his place in Pope's favour and the business that led to, he may have given the impression of a man launched on a very successful career. One aspect of this more successful period in Gilliver's career remains to be considered, his membership of Conger 4. Hodgson and Blagden (p. 68) say that Gilliver belonged to a copyright-owning conger, conforming to Bailey's definition in 1730: '. . . a Society of booksellers to the number of 10 or more, who unite into a sort of company, or contribute a joint stock for the printing of books' (p. 86). The Conger bought copyrights, paid for printing, and sold books to the trade at an agreed price. The members of Conger 4 were John Brotherton, Joseph Hazard, William Meadows, Thomas Cox, William Hinchliffe, Ralph Weaver Bickerton, Thomas Astley, Stephen Austen, Lawton Gilliver, and Robert Willock. The first book they advertised together was Jenkin Thomas Phillipps's Rational Grammar in January 1731, and this was followed shortly by advertisements for Joseph Trapp's Works of Virgil . Gilliver had probably arranged for the purchase of Trapp's Virgil , and there is no reason to believe his contribution to the Conger was unimportant. He had established contacts with some of the other Conger members well in advance of 1731: his name appears with those of Cox, Astley, and Austen in March 1728 in advertisements for the History of the Council of Constance ; in June of that year he and Meadows were among book-sellers advertising Fresnoy's New Method of Studying History ; in February 1729 we find him associated with Willock in Doughty's Crown and Church ; and in March 1730 he and Brotherton published the Nurse's Guide . The Conger was not, therefore, a move into fresh territory for Gilliver, but the creation of a stable arrangement with booksellers he had been dealing with for some time. The Conger dealt mainly in instructional and educational books, but it published two popular works, Eight Volumes of Letters Written by a Turkish Spy and La Belle Assemblée by Madeleine Angélique Poisson de Gomez. The Conger broke up towards the end of 1735 (there was a trade sale of copies belonging to Mr Astley and Conger on 11 November 1735), and this coincided, unhappily for Gilliver, with the deterioration in his relations with Pope. In addition, the Grubstreet Journal was in decline; its last number appeared on 29 December 1737. The first half of Gilliver's career, based on Pope's patronage and extensive dealings in copyrights, was over. Dr Terry Belanger has suggested to me that Gilliver's response to the new situation was to leave copyrights pretty much alone and concentrate on the retailing side of his business; there is every evidence to support his opinion. Some time in 1736 Gilliver went into partnership with John Clarke, whom Belanger first identified as Gilliver's apprentice. The son of John Clarke of Northampton, he had been bound to Gilliver for £50 on 4 March 1729 and obtained his freedom on 6 April 1736. 32 We first find his name linked with Gilliver's in advertisements for Henry Carey's Honest Yorkshireman in January 1736, but his partnership is more likely to date officially from some time after his freedom. The first copy we know he had a share in was The Intelligencer or Merchant's Assistant , entered to Clarke, Gilliver, and Meadows on 30 March 1738. This was followed by three more copies shared with Gilliver: James Miller's Of Politeness on 24 April 1738, Solitude on 12 December 1738, and (with S. Austen) Joseph Trapp's The Nature, Folly, Sin, and Danger of Being Righteous Over Much on 5 June 1739. This amounts to only four copies entered in three years and marks the shift in emphasis in Gilliver's business. In the three months before June 1736, when the change seems to have begun, Gilliver entered six copies in the Register; in the six years following that date, he entered only seven. The shop in Fleet Street must have seemed inadequate in the face of this change of emphasis, for Gilliver opened another shop, in Westminster Hall, probably some time in 1737. John Davys's Essay on the Art of Decyphering , advertised in February 1737, bears the imprint, 'London: printed for L. Gilliver and J. Clarke, at Homer's Head, in Fleet-street, and at their shop in Westminster-hall.' Perhaps Clarke was to take charge of the new shop. The law courts were in Westminster Hall and Gilliver seems to have dealt in law books to some degree. At his sales on 25 February and 16 March 1742, 33 there were shares on Bohun's Law of Tithes and Tithing Table , the Universal Officer of Justice , and Coke's Reports and State Trials on offer; while there were copies of over sixty separate works on law for sale. There is relatively little evidence available on this phase of Gilliver's career, but it was clearly a failure. The shop in Westminster Hall did not last long. It is last mentioned in the imprint of An Essay towards the Character of the Late Chimpanzee in April 1739. His partnership with Clarke seems to have ended in the same year: both their names appear in the imprint of Trapp's The Nature, Folly, Sin and Danger of Being Righteous Over Much in June 1739, but Clarke's is not on that of William Brownsword's Laugh and Lie Down in July of that same year. Gilliver prospered ill after the departure of his partner, and on 25 February 1742 there was a trade sale of 'the stock of a bookseller, lately left off trade' which seems to have been Gilliver's because his name is written on the copy in the John Johnson Collection in the Bodleian Library. None of the copies sold was entirely his own; he had acquired shares in them through the Conger or in association with other booksellers. Gilliver gave up his shop in the year of the sale; 34 he must have stopped trading and sold his stock in an attempt to pay his debts. On 3 December 1742 a Commission of Bankruptcy was awarded against him (P.R.O. B4/10, p. 215). I have not discovered who brought proceedings against him, but it is clear from a separate action that he owed something like £400 to his former partner, John Clarke. Clarke had filed a bill against Gilliver before the commission of bankruptcy was awarded and had to be given special permission to be numbered with the other creditors (P.R.O. B1/17, p. 146). When a bankrupt had 'made full discovery of his effects, and in all things conformed to the directions of the act' 35 he was issued with a certificate which secured him from further harassment. An advertisement appeared in the London Gazette for Tuesday 28 June to Saturday 2 July 1743, which said that Gilliver's certificate would be allowed unless reasons to the contrary were given by 23 July. Some objections must have been made, because his certificate was not allowed until 19 November 1743. 36 Gilliver's bankruptcy meant he lost some of the benefit which he would have gained from membership of the Stationers' Company. He had been admitted to the livery of the Company on 7 May 1728, and this gave him the opportunity of becoming a shareholder in the English Stock. He obtained a £40 share on 6 June 1738, but the Court decreed on 6 December 1743 that his share should be assigned to Daniel Midwinter by way of mortgage under the commission of bankruptcy. He was chosen to receive Knapton's £80 share on 7 July 1747, but on 6 October that too was assigned to Midwinter. By this time Gilliver had started to do business again. He had obtained his certificate, and in 1744 we find him publishing An Elegy on Mr. Pope . By 1747 he had moved into a shop in the Oxford Arms Passage, Warwick Lane, 37 only seven doors away from James Roberts, the former distributor of the Grubstreet Journal , who seems to have distributed the Elegy on Mr. Pope for him. Gilliver's business must have been based on retailing because we find his name on only four more books during this period: Andrew Trebeck's Sermon . . . before . . . the House of Commons , James Drummond's The Female Rebels, Dr. Houstoun's Memoirs of his own Life-Time , and Truth but no Treason . Two of these are Jacobite in tone, and it it possible that he published them, as he had done the Elegy on Mr. Pope , because of personal interest. Gilliver remained in his new premises only a short time. His burial is recorded in the register of Christ Church, Newgate, on 8 August 1748. An Elizabeth Gilliver, possibly his wife, had been buried on 12 April. 38 The death is confirmed by the records of the Court of the Stationers' Company for 6 September 1748: 'Mr. Roberts acquainted the Court that Mr. Lawton Gilliver who was possessed of an 80 1. Share was dead and that the share was therefore to be disposed of. . . .' Gilliver's story is, therefore, one of failure. He came to London with capital to support him and he made a good beginning. He had Pope's patronage and the contacts that afforded him, and he joined other relatively young booksellers to form 'Conger 4.' But his position as Pope's bookseller was probably less advantageous and less assured than he believed. He had to pay a very high price for Pope's copies, and there may have been difficulties with his fellow booksellers as a result. The poems of Pope's protégés did not always sell well and the Grubstreet Journal encountered difficulties, some of them perhaps due to Pope's promptings. It seems probable that he neglected the ordinary business which would have given his trade a sound basis, and suffered in consequence. In some ways he obtained the worst of both worlds: for although he allowed Pope to shape his business, he did not accommodate him enough to maintain his favour and the support that would have provided. Note I have compiled a list of Gilliver's publications, of entries to him in the Stationers' Register, and of the copies sold at his trade sale. The list is deposited on microfilm in the library of the University of Keele, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, England, and copies can be obtained by arrangement with the Librarian.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Further History of Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington : The Manuscript at Trinity College and the Galley Proof at Lincoln by Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. and Christopher Ricks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alfred Tennyson was a consummate and indefatigable craftsman, and the relation of his craftsmanship to his art is superbly evidenced in his first major poem as Poet Laureate, the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington . The present writers have previously described the compositional background of the poem and its critical reception, and from manuscripts and proof sheets at Harvard University as well as printed editions spanning twenty years, have offered extensive evidence of Tennyson's care in bringing his work to its finished state. 1 There is now available to scholars the only full and (except for two MS fragments of strophes IV and VI at Harvard) the earliest manuscript of the Ode —that at Trinity College, Cambridge, a manuscript which formerly could be neither copied nor quoted; and cataloguing of the family materials at the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln has brought to light a galley proof for the first edition, containing Tennyson's autograph corrections. Since these two new documents make it possible to add considerably to the history of the poem, our enterprise here is to augment, especially from the rich mine of the Trinity MS, the previous account of Tennyson's creative process and to provide a full collation that records the alterations in all manuscripts and the textual variants in existing MSS and printed states. 2 Throughout the account which follows, all references to the places within the Collation where the particular early readings are located appear in square brackets. Other line references are shown in parentheses. All numbers key to the lines of the authoritative text in the Eversley Edition, from which final readings are quoted. 3 The Lincoln galley proof (of which there is a detailed description below in the Bibliographical Note) was pulled from the same type as the uncorrected galley proof for the first edition at Harvard. Its many autograph corrections range from the simple correcting of misprints, through numerous changes of punctuation (particularly important to a poem of which the movement and pace are firmly commanded), to substantial changes in wording. These may be simple but central, as in the justifiably confident assertion that Wellington 'asserts his claim' (70) to his great name—an autograph correction from 'prefers his claim', which had an air either of archaism or of mere predilection. Other corrections to the proof involve a whole sequence, and in particular a self-awareness as to the poem's duty of reverent reticence. Thus in the final lines of the proof, in the final strophe, Yet our thoughts are loud and vain Clamorous memories, all too free . . . are amplified (but in the opposite way from an amplifier) when Tennyson wrote in their place these lines evoking a noble swell of controlled feeling: More than is of man's degree Must be with us, watching here At this, our great solemnity. Whom we see not we revere. We revere, &amp; we refrain From talk of battles loud &amp; vain, And brawling memories all too free . . . .(242-248) A detailed description of Tennyson's creation of the poem, folio by folio in the Trinity MS, is given below (see the Bibliographical Note). As a brief introduction to a critical consideration, it is enough to point out here that the manuscript in Trinity Notebook 25 runs from folio 6 to folio 16; and that in the MS Tennyson worked by expanding his drafts on the versos, doing a great deal of re-writing, usually without deleting his earlier drafts, and building up passages and strophes with elaborate care. The final text of the poem in this state consists of 233 lines, as compared with the 251 lines of the first edition and the 281 lines of the ultimate version. There was only one structural decision which Tennyson had not as yet made: the addition of strophe II, on where the Duke was to be buried. The most substantial revisions, involving several drafts, occur—not surprisingly—in the three strophes which together constitute more than half of the poem: VI, VII, and VIII. These are the strophes which are bent imaginatively upon the past and the future (as against the imminent present of the burial ceremony) and which are most compacted of argument and high doctrine—religious, political, and patriotic. All revisions, however minute, by a poet as scrupulous and gifted as Tennyson are important, but the large-scale points are these: that by the time of the Trinity MS strophes I, III, and IV were substantially shaped for publication; that V did not at this stage prick Tennyson into much revision, but was to be revised and expanded for publication; that VI prompted several re-draftings, was to be further revised for publication, and included in MS six lines which were probably the germ of VII: Hereafter on the fields of bliss Brother Angels bright &amp; strong If France intend aught but good—&amp; fair Be Britains guardian angels there And guard this last free commonweal from wrong Labour great Ghosts in your old countrys cause . . . [151-191] that VIII was drafted before VII; that VII prompted several re-draftings, was to be further revised, and included a group of lines on Hampden [151, 153, 156-158] (which were deleted and the lines as published inserted), as well as a lengthy passage on 'Their Great Napoleons' [173-179], which would not finally figure in the poem; that VIII likewise prompted several re-draftings, was to be further revised, and included a few deleted and rewritten lines on the French attitude to Wellington [192-231; also 192-197]; and, lastly, that IX was expanded from jottings, through a first draft, to what was substantially the text as first published. One may first ask of the MS what it manifests which is germane to the question of the extent to which, and the spirit in which, Tennyson attended to the reviews. The MS evidence supports the belief that Tennyson was usually prompted by reviews to revision only when he felt a concurrence grounded in his maturing sense of things (pp. 160-163; and Shannon, Tennyson and the Reviewers , 1952). Four main heads were suggested, in 1960, under which Tennyson's published revisions may have been influenced by the reviewers: the addition of lines evoking Wellington as soldier and as statesman; the addition of lines on the interment; the qualifying of the very dark picture of England's loss and of England's future; and an intensification of the religious note. What light do the revisions—both within the MS and from the MS—throw upon these? Apt to the first head (Wellington as soldier and statesman), though not involving such an added emphasis as The Times was to ask for, Tennyson's revisions of strophe IV show that he early understood what was needed here, but he did not, for instance, arrive at once at the right tribute to the statesman: 'O voice from which their omens all men drew' (36). The earliest MS fragment (Harvard MS 1 ) contains the line, but beginning 'Lost voice . . .'. Tennyson saw that this would not do, presumably because 'Lost' is doubly unsatisfactory: first, in too much cutting off the present from the Duke's statesmanlike wisdom, as if it were irrecoverably lost; and second, in the altogether unwanted suggestion—'Lost voice'—of losing one's voice. So Tennyson dropped the line, which does not appear in the Trinity MS. But the line made its rightful appearance in the galley proofs and the published text, with 'Lost voice' replaced by 'O voice'. The misleading suggestions have gone, and moreover there is the dignified and surprisingly unexclamatory sequence of exclamations: four consecutive lines beginning with 'O', the fourth then swelling into the line which crowns them, and all terminating in a single simple exclamation mark: O good gray head which all men knew, O voice from which their omens all men drew, O iron nerve to true occasion true, O fall'n at length that tower of strength Which stood four-square to all the winds that blew! (35-39) Tennyson has himself handled this statesmanly note in a statesmanly manner—one that was natural, too, to the poet who asked in 'Sea Dreams': Is it so true that second thoughts are best? Not first, and third, which are a riper first? (65-66) As for Wellington the soldier, the MS provides ample evidence that Tennyson more and more came to see the need for incorporating a substantial and specific sense of Wellington's character and achievements. Thus strophe VI moved through three drafts [80-150], where the development is clear: the first did not specify Wellington's achievements as 'the greatest soldier'; the second added the victories in Hindustan, in the Pyrenees, and at Waterloo; the third amplified the description of Waterloo itself. Under the next head (the addition in 1853 of lines 266-270 on the interment itself), the MS again shows that Tennyson had already moved in the direction in which he may have come to be further influenced. For the appearance in the galley proofs of strophe II, which is not in the MS, is one crucial step towards the factual and final 'committal of the body to the earth' (p. 161). Strophe II begins: Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore? (8) The Trinity MS, though it had not arrived at this decisive moment of decision as to the burial itself, was in readiness for it, since it included (as the previous Harvard fragment, MS 1 , did not) the later line from which these lines in strophe II about the place of burial were created retrospectively, in both senses: 'For such was he whom we deplore' [40]. In strophe V, on the other hand, it may at first seem that Tennyson retreated from the evocation of the actual burial, when he progressed from the Trinity MS to the published text. For the MS [43-61] has, twice, the line 'Bury him under the dome', and then 'Lay the warrior there in his latest home'. But one can guess why these lines did not satisfy Tennyson. For a start, they constituted the wrong sort of repetition, circling back to the poem's opening lines enjoining that the Duke be buried. Next, there was the prepositional ambiguity created by 'under' in 'Bury him under the dome' (under the earth under the dome?). More substantially, the 'committal of the body to the earth', with its finality, would find its fitting place only in the final strophe of the poem. Tennyson's revision when he published the text was one which managed to anticipate, in the right sense, the final committal of the body, and yet—in its calculated distance of phrasing—not to anticipate it in the wrong sense. For in strophe V he dropped the lines 'Bury him . . .', 'Bury him . . .', and 'Lay the warrior . . .', and replaced them within: All is over and done: Render thanks to the Giver, England, for thy son. Let the bell be toll'd. Render thanks to the Giver, And render him to the mould. (43-48) These lines are apposite to another of the categories where Tennyson may later have been influenced by reviewers though in a direction already estimated and esteemed by him, the 'intensified religious note in the second edition' (pp. 162-163). Thus Tennyson came to hear that the opening injunction in strophe V in the Trinity MS, 'Give him back to the Giver!' [43-61], lacked the right note; indeed, the words could too easily be misheard as a perfunctoriness of ingratitude, as when someone sends us their love and we catch ourselves asking that it be sent back. The published text rectified this possibility by making gratitude explicit and reiterated, and by the intensification latent within this repetition, one which finally modulates into a turn that both is and is not a repetition: 4 Render thanks to the Giver . . . Render thanks to the Giver, And render him to the mould. Strophe V, with its evocation of St. Paul's Cathedral, is particularly compacted of such instances, as Tennyson came to move from his early thoughts in the Trinity MS to his published text. Thus the MS does not have the sombre religious note, as of a deeply discreet half-allusion to 'It is finished', with which Tennyson, paradoxically, was to open V: 'All is over and done'. Nor does the MS have the tolling of the bell—in itself an intensified religious note—which three times rings out 'Let the bell be toll'd' (46, 53, 58), a sound which then merges into another religious note such as was not heard in the MS: 'And the sound of the sorrowing anthem roll'd' (60). Another revision, from the Trinity MS to the published text, is a parallel of a sort to an instance of a published revision which perhaps owed something to a reviewer. In 1853 Tennyson added thanks to God for 'England's natural strategic advantage' (p. 162): Thank Him who isled us here, and roughly set His Saxon [Briton 1864] in blown seas and storming showers . . . (154-155) This published revision ministered to an uncomplacent (God-acknowledging) patriotism of past and future. There is a revision from the Trinity MS to the text in the galley proofs which has a similar impulse. For the published text, unlike the MS, acknowledges, tactfully but powerfully, the blessing of Heaven at the victorious moment of Waterloo: 'Heaven flash'd a sudden jubilant ray' (129). So here too the poem grew already for Tennyson along lines which he was to be further stimulated to follow after publication; moreover it is a characteristic felicity that the grateful acknowledgment should be grounded upon a historical fact. Tennyson in the Eversley Edition says: 'The setting sun glanced on this last charge of the English and Prussians'. Not, of course, that every reference to God would be sure to constitute an intensifying of the religious note; Tennyson was right to decide against (and to delete before the poem reached galleys) those lines where the Trinity MS too grandly made play with God on England's side, and which far from deepening the religious note would have shallowly and sententiously polemicized it: Half godded underneath a scornful sky Their Great Napoleons live &amp; die With rolling echoes by the nations heard. But shall we count them Gods who break their word The word is God: thou shalt not lie . . . [173-179] These lines bring us to the one remaining category of review-spurred revision: the patriotic and the English. Tennyson had a task of delicacy and complexity here. He needed to praise England for begetting the Duke, and the Duke for embodying England. He needed to praise the Duke as unique, belonging to a giant race, and yet as having inculcated a patriotic education and having provided an example such as must live on. It was a moment for national pride, and it was no time for national complacency. The statement 'The last great Englishman is low' (18) had been followed in 1852 by a necessary and heart-animating qualification, and was to have the qualification clarified in 1853, perhaps because of a reviewer (p. 162). It is clear from the MS that Tennyson was aware of danger here; and the emphasis—at once salutary and a salutation—which grows throughout the growth of the poem is upon Wellington's especial power to teach, to inspire, to instil a like mind, a power which is greater than just the power to win by his own prowess: So great a soldier taught us there, What long-enduring hearts could do In that world-earthquake, Waterloo! (131-133) For in the Trinity MS 'a soldier' had been, more grandly and less greatly, 'a victor'. ('Alone I did it', vaunts Coriolanus.) The words proceeded through a characteristic maturing of judgment: from 'So wise a victor broke him there', through 'So great a soldier led them there' (Harvard MS 4 ), into the truly educative, 'So great a soldier taught us there | What long-enduring hearts could do . . .'. Not a victor, but a soldier; and not that he broke him (Napoleon), or led them , but that he taught us . The sequence shows Tennyson bent upon doing justice to Wellington's greatness: that he was not only great, but the cause that greatness was in others. There is an analogous revision in line 192, where the Trinity MS 'Victor' became 'leader': 'Lo, the leader in these glorious wars . . .'. 5 Wellington's glory is that he did not arrogate all such glory to himself, and his sharing the glory (as the word 'leader' does and the word 'victor' did not) does not diminish but augment it. The final, capitalized 'Victor' in line 258—'And Victor he must ever be'—gains its metaphysical and religious force from the poem's not having squandered the word in earlier aggrandisements. For the only previous use of the word is now one that trumps Napoleon's vainglory with the word: 'The great World-victor's victor' (42). Such a sharing of credit in a way which gains a higher credit is evident, too, in the acknowledgment of the Prussians' part at Waterloo. 'Last, the Prussian trumpet blew' (127): there was no such line in the Trinity MS, and the omission was not only an ungrateful historical suppression but might also be bad for the English, of whose national complacency Tennyson was fearful. It was a simple addition, and an important one, yet it cost Tennyson more trouble than one would have expected, going through four slightly-varied versions. Could it be that he felt obliged to make the correction on the Lincoln proof, from 'The trumpet of the Prussian blew', because he suddenly heard and saw Prussian blue ? To turn now to the other class of revisions (pp. 163-166), those which were apparently independent of the reviewers. Here too the published revisions are often anticipated within the MS growth of the poem. The most important such impulse after 1852 was the muting of 'the shrill anti-Gallic note', and Tennyson had felt this impulse (to curb his natural impulses) during the earlier stages of composition. There were printed in 1960 (p. 151,n.7), from the Pierpont Morgan copy of 1852, Tennyson's passionately polemical lines against 'Their Great Napoleons' [173-179]. The lines had taken virtually the same form in the Trinity MS. Tennyson was unquestionably right to expunge them. For one thing, their scorn is too shrill, too little like the high scorn of heaven which Tennyson invokes: Half godded underneath a scornful sky Their Great Napoleons live &amp; die . . . . For another, the effect is of polemicizing the occasion (Wellington's life and death) by harnessing it too brusquely to a political topicality, however urgent. Another weakness of the lines is that they fall victim to a familiar nemesis in hyperbolical dispraise (and conversely in hyperbolical praise): that it ends up carrying unwanted possibilities of the opposite. 'A man of silence in a world of babble': what was meant as distrust of Napoleon III inadvertently carries a possibility of Wellington-like dignity. Indeed, when Tennyson dropped the anti-Napoleon lines, he here transferred the quality of silence to the dead Wellington, once admirably laconic and now alas silent, except as an exemplary voice which must be heeded but cannot be heard: His voice is silent in your council-hall For ever; and whatever tempests lour For ever silent; even if they broke In thunder, silent; yet remember all He spoke among you . . . . (174-178) 'Who never spoke against a foe': Tennyson rightly decided that he must imitate the Duke's restraint. It was not until 1855, however, that Tennyson was able to add that line (185) to the published text, after he had curbed his own impulse to speak against his foes. Tennyson was always wont to sound hysterical when contemplating 'The blind hysterics of the Celt' ( In Memoriam , CIX), and the anti-Gallic note is loud and clear in the Trinity MS, as in the fiery lines: Care not tho' the fiery Frenchman call Wellesley fortune's minion here on earth What is half so blind as wounded pride? [192-231] Such is the first draft; with the second version, Tennyson had somewhat cooled down: And care not ye tho' Frenchmen call Your leader Fortune's minion from his birth . . . . With the final Trinity MS text, Tennyson had jettisoned all that, and had gained instead the dignity of 'Lo the Victor in those glorious wars . . .' [192]. The poem is about victories over oneself as the condition of victories over others, and Tennyson became victorious over some of his own artistically-damaging tendencies. In the Epilogue to 'The Charge of the Heavy Brigade', Tennyson later etymologized the word 'refrain' by hyphenating it: And some new Spirit o'erbear the old, Or Trade re-frain the Powers From war with kindly links of gold . . . . (13-14) His sense of Wellington as a great refrainer asked a comparable reverent bridling of himself, and the word 'refrain' makes a crucial appearance within the lines (not in the Trinity MS) which Tennyson added in autograph on the Lincoln proof: Whom we see not we revere. We revere, &amp; we refrain From talk of battles loud and vain, And brawling memories all too free . . . . (245-249) Tennyson was right to incorporate into his poem his urgent warning about national security; it was apt, and no derogation from the dignity of the occasion. But he would have been wrong to retain so local a glint as the Trinity MS injunction to Nelson and Wellington to be 'Britains guardian angels' 'If France intend aught but good—&amp; fair' [151-191]. No, gently did it, as when Tennyson, instead of excoriation, was able to use intimation, hinting at a crucial distinction between the political worlds of England and France and speaking of . . . the one true seed of freedom sown Betwixt a people and their ancient throne, That sober freedom out of which there springs Our loyal passion for our temperate kings . . . . (162-165) The Trinity MS had said only 'the throne', whereas 'ancient throne' is a covert rebuke to the new unstable Napoleon-worship; and the Trinity MS had said 'Our Britains loyal passion for her kings', whereas the poised repetition of 'our' and the symbiotic equipollence of the epithets ('loyal . . . temperate') establish a weighed and weighty reciprocity and political balance such as constitute a tacit impugning of French intemperance and disloyalty. It should be added, though, that the muting of the shrill anti-Gallic note, in revision, was at one with the muting of the note that shrilled against English appeasers. For this note too threatened the dignity of the occasion, and Tennyson became vigilant about protecting his urgent patriotism of national security against any suspicion that it was a polemical opportunism and a manipulation of the Duke's memory. Hence Tennyson's decision not to elaborate, and indeed to expunge for publication, his reference here: He to such a gorgeous close Elaborated a carp'd at war. [118, 118/119] The observation is itself too carping for such a time and no improvement from the earlier draft: 'Despaird-of war had such a close' [80-150]. It was better to pass over any such reprimand to the carpers and despairers and to pause instead at the simple dignity of 'Such a war had such a close' (118). A similar consideration rescinded the line twice-phrased as 'On men that only seek for power &amp; place', and 'To truckling hearts that only pant for place' [151-191]; the passage as published achieved a higher and graver tone: Who never sold the truth to serve the hour, Nor palter'd with Eternal God for power . . . . (179-180) All these major categories of independent revision in the published text (pp. 163-166)—an increased accuracy, a safe-guarding of the dignity of the Duke's activity, an intensification of the patriotic warnings, an increased emphasis upon work, and a prophetic hope for the universal acceptance of the Duke's life as exemplary—gain antecedent support from the changes both within the Trinity MS and from it. Not all the revisions are incontestably for the better, and there remain some readers who believe, for instance, that the increasing emphasis upon work was a mistake, since no more than the rest of us was Tennyson able to imagine work in Heaven, leave alone work adequate to keep the Duke of Wellington (in Lord Reith's famous phrase) 'fully stretched'. But rather than elaborate with MS findings the established account of the published revisions, it seems best to move now to four further aspects of the poem which the MS illuminates: metaphors, ambiguities, questions, and names. One concern in revision was to scrutinize metaphors. Tennyson was alert to extinguish any distracting flickers. An example is his deciding against the Trinity MS description of the Napoleonic eagle as 'Clutching fire &amp; crown'd with his star' [120/121], presumably because the metaphors create a Gallic furore—how and why does an eagle clutch fire, and how and why is it crowned with a star, and moreover how do the two fit together? Conversely Tennyson revised to create a fitting metaphorical continuity, as when he changed the MS 'His eighty winters breathe rebuke' [151-191], first by seeing no force in 'breathe' (in relation to either 'winter' or 'rebuke') and so trying to minimize the metaphors in 'winters': 'His eightywintered life is all rebuke' [151-191]; next in the final version of the Trinity MS with 'His eighty winters are but one rebuke' [186]; and last by moving in the opposite direction and intensifying the metaphor: 'His [Whose 1852(a)] eighty winters freeze with one rebuke . . .' (1852). The play of 'glitter'd' and 'sunlight' against 'winters' in the Trinity MS proved a distraction, and Tennyson rejected it [173-179]. The 'race | Of honour' in the early passage [151-191] could not satisfactorily be accommodated to Wellington's old age or to his military prowess, and Tennyson simply dropped it. A further category of revisions involves ambiguities. It is remarkable how many of them had crept into a poem of such sturdy Wellington-like manliness of wording—'In his simplicity sublime' (34). Thus the final text (1853) of Mourn, for to us he seems the last, Remembering all his greatness in the Past (19-20) was shaped to rectify the sense that the 1852 text seemed rather to moan than mourn: 'Our sorrow draws but on the golden Past'. But Tennyson's earlier thought, which stands in the Trinity MS, had been open to a different objection. 'Partial sorrow loves the past'—this would not do for various reasons. First, the assonance of 'Partial . . . past' was at once insistent and imperfect (contrast 'the weight and fate of Europe', 240). Second, 'partial', by which Tennyson meant to suggest a proper propensity not to be impartial (sorrow, honourably enought, has a vested interest in the past), not only introduced an inappropriate complication of distinction but also invited the wrong other sense of 'partial', as if the sorrow were not full or complete but only partial. Six lines earlier Tennyson had written 'As fits an universal woe', and there was necessarily an uneasy fit between that line and any reference to 'Partial sorrow'. A related revision a few lines later shows Tennyson guarding his reader against what might otherwise trap him into a false sense of parallelism. The Trinity MS has: Mourn, for our chief State-oracle is mute: Mourn for the man of long-enduring blood . . . . This sets up a gratuitous or excessive soliciting by juxtaposing two lines that begin with 'Mourn' and 'for', where the 'for' has quite different meanings (Mourn, because / Grieve at the loss of). 6 Tennyson finally retained this grave play or turn, but with a sufficient pause within which to rotate, and so without a reliance on the comma alone to make clear the distinction of sense and the turn of thought: Mourn, for to us he seems the last, (19) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Mourn for the man of long-enduring blood . . . . (24) Not only did he, in 1853, interpolate lines 21-22: No more in soldier fashion will he greet With lifted hand the gazer in the street. He also re-worded, for publication in 1852, the line which is intermediate between line 19 and line 24, so that it no longer read 'Mourn, for our chief State-oracle is mute', but 'O friends, our chief state-oracle is mute' (23). Such an instance as 'Mourn . . .' has particular importance because the whole poem is composed of injunction and adjuration, from its opening words: 'Bury the Great Duke' (a simple but inspired revision in 1855) modulating at once into the less imperious 'Let us bury the Great Duke', through to that repeated urging of injunction, 'Peace' (peace in honour of the great warrior), and so to the final adjuration, which is not command but prayer: 'God accept him, Christ receive him'. Such conclusive simplicity had no room for the turn, which the Trinity MS shows Tennyson to have contemplated, of 'leave to' (cease to) against 'leave', in an early Trinity MS draft: But leave to speak of his renown And lay your earthly fancies down X t receive him; leave him leave him. [232-281] Not only does that have the distracting play of 'leave to' against 'leave' and the unwanted ambiguity (noun or verb?) in 'leave to speak' (permission to speak, sir—in the military idiom), but it also creates entirely the wrong tone with its repetition 'X t receive him; leave him leave him', which sounds not like tranquil trusting resignation but like exasperation. Clearly Tennyson did not wish to remove from his poetry all those innumerable delicacies of decision by which a reader experiences the active life of a poem in his own active construing and construction of it. But the revisions make it clear that Tennyson was vigilant about setting limits to such possibilities of flickers of hesitation or misreading. Thus to 'clash with' someone would normally be to conflict with them, with functioning there as opposition and not alliance. But Tennyson used the expression with local successful surprise, so that it did mean alliance: This is he that far away Against the myriads of Assaye Clash'd with his fiery few and won . . . . (98-100) 'Clash'd with' retains its slight and justified oddity (as if fighting off the usual hostile sense); what protects the reader against a flat misconstruction is that the line is preceded by the indisputably hostile preposition 'Against', and it is exactly this protection which was lacking in a Trinity MS draft: He that in his early day Clashing with his fiery few On their myriads at Assaye Charged &amp; shock'd &amp; overthrew . . . . [80-150] The sequence there is such that for a moment the words make it sound as if Wellington were quarrelling with—clashing with—his own 'fiery' troops, instead of clashing, in command of them, against the enemy. But then the whole of this section [80-150], when in MS, was alive with unwanted uncertainties: And when they thought our prowess dead Lifted up the spirits of men And led them on, with blows on blows . . . . Who are 'they'? There is no clear antecedent except the 'myriads at Assaye'. 7 And wasn't it not so much men's as Englishmen's spirits that were lifted up? And isn't the following 'them' not really the spirits but the men? And doesn't 'with blows on blows' here sound as if Wellington were leading them by cudgelling them? The next MS revision then neutralized this last possibility in advance: 'Beating back with blows on blows' [109/110], and so into the published text, which became in 1853: Beating from the wasted vines Back to France her banded swarms, Back to France with countless blows . . . . (109-111) Or, still in the same passage, there was the dangerous vagueness of 'When the Godlike portent grew', which was meant as a dark shaft at the French but which sounds at once reverent, sarcastic, and wobbly. (Likewise the word 'Genius' in 'let the tyrant Genius fall' [192-123]. Then, three lines after the 'Godlike portent', there was: 'He taught what hearts of oak can do'. But 'hearts of oak', with its famous naval timbre, makes Wellington too much trespass upon Nelson's realm. Tennyson's revision, 'long-enduring hearts' (132), was magnificently felicitous because the epithet is used of Wellington himself earlier in the poem. The reciprocity of the leader and the led is perfectly joined in their both being 'longenduring', and the reciprocity is further deepened by the relation of Wellington's 'long-enduring blood ' (24) to these 'long-enduring hearts '. If Wellington 'taught' all this, he did so—as the taking-up of the epithet (which itself thus means endures ) from the earlier line has intimated—by the best means: personal example, itself a matter of that reciprocity which is integrity: 'O iron nerve to true occasion true' (37), where Harvard MS 1 had the unreciprocating 'each occasion'. 8 There is comparable reciprocity and grateful continuity in the line 'Warriors carry the warrior's pall' (6), which was revised from the Trinity MS 'And the heads of the people carry the pall', a line which not only lacked the reciprocity and continuity but which also suffered from an ambiguity in 'heads . . . carry'. Tennyson in revision was very sensitive to the appositeness of epithets. One which might be right within a certain context—'Worthy of our gorgeous rites' (93)—might sound callously aesthetic elsewhere, even though it was within the same strophe: 'He to such a gorgeous close' [118]. Tennyson's change from this line in the Trinity MS was characteristic not only in expunging the risky epithet, but also in then relying entirely upon 'such'; for the two lines became on publication: 'Such a war had such a close'. Instead of the single 'such', there was now the balanced reciprocity of the two; and 'such' is admirable for Tennyson's purposes in its confident allusiveness to the unmistakably known. 9 Matters of tone arise with another category of revision which is related to a singular strength of the poem: its way with questions. The poem as published asks only three questions; each is of a different kind, and all three gain force from this and from the fact that they are so few. There is a literal question from the public voice, inaugurating a strophe: 'Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?' (8). There is a figurative question from the imagined shade of Nelson, again inaugurating a strophe: 'Who is he that cometh, like an honoured guest . . .?' (80). And there is a rhetorical question—deep within the final strophe—from the general human consciousness, except that 'rhetorical' is the wrong word for so strongly undeviating an affirmation: 'What know we greater than the soul?' (265). The Trinity MS lacked the first of these questions, since it did not have strophe II. Tennyson supplied this question, and no less importantly he modified the tone of Nelson's imagined question, a question incidentally ('Who is he . . .?') which, because it opens the strophe, wins some of its value from the reader's not yet knowing that the shade of Nelson speaks, so that the reader is pressed aptly to the same question 'Who is he . . .?'. The first draft of these lines had sounded, not like patriarchal inquiry, but like irritation: Who is this the nation bury breaking in upon my rest Why the banner &amp; the music &amp; the soldier &amp; the priest? Who is this? [80-150] Compare the published text: Who is he that cometh, like an honour'd guest, With banner and with music, with soldier and with priest, With a nation weeping, and breaking on my rest? (80-82) The tone of dignified yet unaggrieved interrogative remonstration is a consequence of the revisions: that instead of three brusquely successive questions, there is now one only; that there is no longer the exasperated air which came with the repetition of 'Who is this?', and indeed with the word 'this' instead of 'he'; that there is no longer the acerbity of the question 'Why the banner &amp; the music &amp; the soldier &amp; the priest?' (Nelson's not to reason why), exacerbated as it was by the four items listed with their sharp accumulative 'and's' (the published text not only abolished the tetchy 'Why the . . .', but also placated the rhythm down into poised pairs of pairs: 'With banner and with music, with soldier and with priest'); and that the participle 'breaking' has been calmed to 'breaking on my rest', 10 rather than 'breaking in upon my rest' (which sounds like social crassness), and moreover has already been neutralized by the unaggressive pathos of the other participle which now immediately precedes it: 'With a nation weeping, and breaking . . .'. All these, and other effects (such as those of rhythm and rhyme, or the removal of the clumsy singular/plural tremor in 'the nation bury'), give the question in its final form a particular lucidity. The poem's third question, 'What know we greater than the soul?', is one of which Tennyson in 1853 increased the just impact by adding lines 259-261—'For tho' the Giant Ages heave the hill . . .' (p. 163); so that the question became the climax to a pageant of historical and cosmic vistas. Yet the clarity of all three of these questions depended upon their having no tawdry or less telling associates, and the MS shows Tennyson at first yielding to and then rejecting the solicitations of interrogative rhetoric. Again it is a matter of a stridency such as detracts from the Duke's dignity even in a moment of praising him, with what is a falsely rhetorical questioning: . . . was he one of those Who dodge &amp; shuffle with the truth . . . . [151-191] This question remained through two more drafts, and in the final draft, and even in the MS (later than the Trinity MS) which is tipped into the Morgan copy of 1852 (and is listed in the Collation as ET/52(a)): Was our great Chief (his life is bare from youth To all men's comments till his latest hour) A man to dodge and shuffle with the Truth And palter with Eternal God for power? [173-179] (180) Wellington's greatness was best served by eschewing the bluster of a rhetorical question, and the printed text of the galley proofs for the first edition arrived at the dignified affirmation: Who never sold the truth to serve the hour, Nor palter'd with Eternal God for power. (179-180) But then it is a marked characteristic of the substantial MS passages which Tennyson grew to reject that they ring with rhetorical questions, as with this question, two lines before 'Was our great Chief . . .?': 'But shall we count them Gods who break their word' [173-179]. Or, of 'the fiery Frenchman': 'What is half so blind as wounded pride?' [192-231]. This negative question was succeeded by a positive one no less hollow in tone, especially as flanked immediately by yet another rhetorical and undoubting question: Hath he glory before the Lord Who shall doubt it . . . . Tennyson dropped both the negative and the positive questions, the MS making it clear that he maturely arrived at the final sequence through the poem of three questions only, none of them polemically rhetorical. A similar judgment would arise from a comparison of the exclamations —especially those involving 'O' and exclamation marks—within the poem and within the MS drafts. Last, the Trinity MS increases our respectful understanding of one of the poem's most striking qualities, striking and yet so discreet and justified as not to be startling: its resolute abstention from names. No-where in this tribute to the Duke of Wellington, except in the title, does his name occur. What could more manifest his intense enduring presence, even in death, than the fact that we are unremittingly conscious of him even while never having to name him? He has earned the tribute, even greater than that of the dukedom of Wellington, of the highest namelessness. His greatness is a matter of his being simply and sublimely 'the Great Duke', 11 from the first line on; and supporting this designation are all the other tributes which function in the poem as names for him, among them: 'the warrior', 'the Man', 'the last great Englishman', 'our chief state-oracle', 'the statesman-warrior', 'our dead captain', 'England's greatest son', 'the greatest soldier', 'their great commander', 'their ever-loyal iron leader'. The last alludes, of course, to the sobriquet 'the Iron Duke' and does so without making Wellington sound too indurately or foreignly iron; Tennyson had revised away the Trinity MS epithet 'ironnatured' [192-231] as too harsh, and in any case it was too close to the song of battle-triumph in The Princess (1847): 'There dwelt an iron nature in the grain' (VI, 34). The imaginative procedure is a courageous one, in that elegiac poetry traditionally felt the duty to blazon forth a name. But Tennyson's Ode intimates that there are some heroes so great as to make us need no reminding of their names. A second aspect of the imaginative decision is that, though the poem says so much about Wellington's great name, the greatness is understood to be that of a name which is true fame and true reputation: With those deep voices our dead captain taught The tyrant, and asserts his claim In that dread sound to the great name, Which he has worn so pure of blame, In praise and in dispraise the same, A man of well-attemper'd frame. O civic muse, to such a name, To such a name for ages long, To such a name, Preserve a broad approach of fame, And ever-echoing avenues of song. (69-79) 'Eternal honour to his name': thus end two strophes, VI and VIII. The poem concludes with the naming of God and Christ and with the unnamed unmistakable repeated him : 'God accept him, Christ receive him'. And throughout the poem there occurs only one proper name: Truth-teller was our England's Alfred named; Truth-lover was our English Duke . . . . (188-189) Whereupon we recall that Alfred—whose name indeed has lived through the centuries—was likewise named the Great. 12 So there is no surprise in Tennyson's repudiation of the Trinity MS lines which breached this noble reticence, a reticence which was grounded in the right kind of public familiarity with the Duke's person and prowess, his solidly known achievements. For the Trinity MS first draft had urged: Care not tho' the fiery Frenchman call Wellesley fortune's minion here on earth . . . . [192-231] 'Wellesley' was variously wrong; for one thing, it introduced a confusing distinction or wobble as to Wellesley/Wellington; for another, it rescinded the tribute that had been granted as the name of Wellington (a very different thing from being so aware of it as never to need to name it); and for a third, it gratuitously violated the self-denying ordinance of not naming. So Tennyson at first revised 'Wellesley' into 'Your leader' [193], and then later removed the whole passage as also too simply and rhetorically anti-French. The muting of the anti-French note is at one with the decision about names in the dropping of the passage about 'Their Great Napoleons' [173-179]. For if, on the highest grounds, Wellington was not to be named, it would have been inappropriate to name his opponents. 'Their Great Napoleons' was therefore abandoned, in accordance with the principle which never named even the greatest Napoleon. Napoleon—and here the unnaming potency works for contempt and not for reverence—remains 'the spoiler': Till one that sought but Duty's iron crown On that loud sabbath shook the spoiler down . . . . (122-123) 13 Wellington's supremacy over Napoleon is expressed, succinctly and with-out naming either of them, in the turn which speaks of Wellington as 'The great World-victor's victor' (42). Neither Wellington's adversary is named, nor his mighty peer Nelson, who is joined with him in an honourable emulation. The shade of Nelson is imagined as asking 'Who is he that cometh . . . ?'. The name of Wellington is not supplied in reply, nor is Nelson's name heard when he is then replied to as 'Mighty Seaman', 'thou famous man, | The greatest sailor since our world began' (83-86). But the MS shows that here too Tennyson grew into an understanding of his imaginative process. For the first draft in the Trinity MS had the direct address of 'Noble Nelson' [80-150], which—since Wellington is not named—damaged the equipollence of 'The greatest sailor . . . the greatest soldier' (86, 88). 14 Similarly, it would have been a mistake for Tennyson to retain the first draft lines of strophe VII which refer to Hampden: Whatever harmonies of law The future world assume Our work is ours—the single note On that strong chord which Hampden smote Will vibrate till the doom. [151, 153, 156-158] Not only does Hampden, because of ship-money, mildly confuse the sailor/soldier balance of the poem, but his name—unlike that of Alfred—simply has not the weight which could counterpoise the unnamed Nelson, let alone the unnamed Wellington. Moreover, such weight as Hampden has was of the wrong kind anyway. Tennyson had first alluded to Hampden, twenty years earlier, in Hail Briton! ; he found the right place for these Trinity MS lines, a further twenty years later, in England and America in 1782 , where Hampden's honourable rebellion against royal tyranny is pertinent to the American rebellion. Hampden was in no way appropriate to the politics of the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington . Nor is it only persons' names to which Tennyson found that he had to be attentive. One of the characteristic reticences is that which alludes to St. Paul's Cathedral without ever naming it, as in Under the cross of gold That shines over city and river . . . (49-50) through to the penultimate line of the poem, 'the vast cathedral' (280). The effect of these references lies in their being so massively known as to ask a reverent reserve. Not that Tennyson had in fact in the Trinity MS originally used the name 'St. Paul's', but he had there permitted himself a word which sat uneasily in the vicinity of the unnamed St. Paul's—the word 'her': Bury him under the dome That lifts above the city her cross of gold . . . . [43-61] The pressure there from 'him' upon 'her' aggravates the clumsy contrariety between the feminine 'her' and the masculine 'St. Paul's', and Tennyson's revision removed the perfectly understandable but imperfect 'her'. A corollary, only at first surprising, of this refraining from names is that in one respect the poem intensely names. The name of England grew in weight and frequency as the poem grew in Tennyson's under-standing. The 'England' of line 45 and of line 161 is not to be heard in the Trinity MS, and the crucial weight given and taken by the word 'English' in line 97—'Nor ever lost an English gun'—is a revision Tennyson made on the Lincoln proof, from 'He that never lost a gun'. Line 95 is a cognate but a more complicated case. Although the Trinity MS does not have 'England' here, it used the word in this vicinity, in honouring Nelson [80-150]. The revision in the Trinity MS from 'England honours thee', into 'Thy country loves thee', and then into 'Thine island loves thee well' (85), is a notable one. It was not until later that Tennyson saw how to reserve the full force of 'England' for Wellington here (in line 95: '. . . this is England's greatest son', which the poet added on the Lincoln proof). His second thought—'Thy country'—wants strength; but 'Thine island' is admirable in its quiet emphasis of England's strategic position and of Nelson's particular military indispensability, different from Wellington's: Thine island loves thee well, thou famous man, The greatest sailor since the world began. (85-86) There is a similar judicious gravity in the weight of Truth-teller was our England's Alfred named; Truth-lover was our English Duke . . . (188-189) where 'English' balances, and is answered by, 'England's'. The earliest draft of these lines in the Trinity MS [151-191] first had 'our noble Duke', which lacked the weighed parallel and offered a ghostly play of 'noble' and 'Duke', as well as creating the complication of attributing nobility to Wellington while not attributing it to Alfred. This draft also had 'our Saxon Alfred', which again lacked the parallel, and which invited a feeling not of historical continuity but of historical discontinuity. Given Tennyson's decision for 'England's' over 'Saxon' in the final version in the Trinity MS, it is the more surprising that he so long left 'His Saxon' (155, 1853-1862) before seeing that he should say 'His Briton' (1864); but perhaps he would not have lapsed into this 'Saxon' had he written lines 154-155 at the same time as he was revising 'Saxon' out of line 188 in the same strophe, rather than writing them as he did after publication in 1852 for the 1853 edition. Tennyson deserves much and various honour for what he does and does not do with names throughout the poem, but perhaps it will suffice finally to make two points. First, there is only one local place-name (as against England, France, and Europe) which appears more than once, and this with the greatest force of aptness: Waterloo. Second, the decision to name London, as Tennyson did when he added strophe II (not in the Trinity MS), was not only a recognition of a needed factual simplicity, but was also a fitting acknowledgment of the centrality of Wellington to English life comparable to that of London itself: Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore? Here, in streaming London's central roar. (8-9) 'Central' acknowledges both the centre of London and London as centre, and this, as is clear from the three lines following, conduces to Wellington's central and capital importance. Tennyson's first published text in 1852 does not have line 9 ('Here . . .'), which meant not only that the question (Where?) was left hanging for ever without explicit answer, but also that the strophe lacked the central dignity which was finally accorded by and to London. The reason why it was a lapse of judgment by Tennyson (at once rectified) to interpolate in 1853 between the first and second lines of strophe II the words 'He died on Walmer's lonely shore' is not only that the words 'interfered with the direct antiphonal reply to the question "Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?"' (p. 165), but also that there is such an imbalance between 'Walmer' and 'London', in a poem where the weight and fate of names is so sensitively and strongly felt. 'Eternal honour to his name', Wellington's and Tennyson's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE Description of the MS in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge The Trinity MS of the Ode appears in a notebook bound in marbled boards with black imitation calf spine and fore corners, measuring 7⅜” x 9⅛” (press mark O. 15. 25). There are gilt double rules near the top and bottom of the spine. Pasted at the top, below the middle, and at the bottom of the spine are a large capital 'O' under a design (both printed) and the printed numerals '15' and '25'. In approximately the middle of the spine on a white cloth gummed label, is written in ink, vertically with the spine: 'XXXVII. The Duke. Rise Britons | Boadicea. Will.'. The outside front cover has a pasted label, cut from white laid paper, showing scissor marks and measuring approximately 1⅞” x 2 5 / 16 ”, which bears in Hallam Tennyson's hand-writing, 'The Duke [ in pencil ] | XXXVII [ in ink ] | Rise Britons | Boadicea | Will [ all three in pencil ]'. The inside front cover has on the upper left-hand corner in pencil, '2/-' and a blue circular seal pasted in the center, carrying the printed information 'Medical | and other Students' NOTE | and | MANUSCRIPT | Book | Warehouse', ringed by the printed address, 'John Mabley, 9 Wellington Street North, Strand'. Of the sixty-nine leaves of light greyish blue wove unwatermarked paper that the notebook originally contained, sixteen remain, which, varying slightly in size, average in measurement 7¼” x 9” and are numbered in pencil in the upper right-hand corner of each recto 1 through 16. The MS of the Ode appears on fols. 6-16. A description of the complete contents of the notebook is as follows: Fol. 1 fifteen lines from Boadicea ; verso blank, followed by stubs of 3 torn-out leaves 2-3 a draft of Rise Britons ; 3 v blank 4 begins a second draft of Rise Britons 4 v contains a list of rhymes, beginning 'seaman hails 2' and continuing immediately below with '2 pales. pails. | bales. bails' . . . . 5-5 v second draft of Rise Britons continues; followed by stubs of 38 leaves torn or scissored out; two carry evidence of words in ink and two others of ink markings, possibly fragments of drawings 6-9 v Ode . . . Wellington ; followed by 3 stubs 10-16 Ode . . . Wellington continues 16 v a draft of Will ; followed by 9 stubs The Trinity MS presents the opening strophes of the poem (though at no point are strophes actually numbered) in substantially the form that they were to take on publication, with the exception of strophe II, which does not appear within the MS. The recto of the initial leaf (fol. 6) contains strophes I, III, and IV; IV then runs over on to fol. 6 v , where V follows. (A section [67-79] from this draft of V is later re-drafted on fol. 10). Folio 7 has VI, here concluding with six lines [151-191] which are germane to and possibly the germ of VII—six lines which Tennyson later dropped. (VI is re-drafted on fols. 10, 10 v , 11, and 12.) Folio 8 begins VIII (of which there is an alternative draft of some lines [192-231] on the verso opposite, fol. 7 v ); fol. 8 v continues, making a new start from fol. 8, with a revised conclusion to VIII, thus ending the first draft of VIII. (Later drafts of VIII occur on fols. 12 v , 13, 13 v , 14, and 15). Folio 9 carries a first and second version of some lines [151-191] from VII, a third version of them being at the foot of fol. 8 v opposite. Folio 9 v has some first jottings [232-281] for IX (which is fully drafted on fols. 14 v , 15, 15 v and 16). Folio 10 has a second version of the end of V [67-79], followed by a second version of VI [80-150], which continues, first, on fol. 11 (of which some lines are themselves revised on fol. 10 v opposite), and then on fol. 12. Folio 12 has a second version of VII [151-191] (the opening lines of which are deleted and re-drafted, 151, 153, 156-158, on fol. 11 v opposite); this version continues on fol. 13. Folio 13 has, at its foot, the beginning of a second version of VIII [192-231] (of which the opening four lines plus two on the top of fol. 14 are deleted and re-drafted, 192-197, on fol. 12 v ); this version of VIII continues on fol. 14 (with a line deleted and two lines [218/219] to be interpolated for it from fol. 13 v opposite); and continues on fol. 15. Folio 15 then has the first extended draft of IX (of which there were jottings on fol. 9 v [232-281]), which concludes with the poem's last two lines on fol. 16; additional and revised lines [232-281] for the conclusion of IX are on fol. 15 v opposite. For the final draft of IX, Tennyson returned to fol. 14 v . Description of the Galley Proof in the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln The Lincoln galley proof with the author's autograph corrections (Item No. 4164, Tennyson in Lincoln: A Catalogue of the Collection in the Research Centre , comp. by Nancie Campbell, 2 vols., 1971-1973, II, 40) is a proof for the first edition of the Ode. Printed in four parallel columns (numbered in type at the right below each column '1', '2', '3', '4' respectively) on a single sheet of white wove unwatermarked paper, 17 7 / 16 ;” x 22½”, this proof now exists in three separate sheets, with columns 1 and 2 appearing on the first, column 3 on the second, and column 4 on the third. The first sheet bears in the upper right hand corner of the recto the pencilled number '94' and in the centre of the verso in ink, 'G.S. Venables Esq', apparently not in the poet's hand, though possibly in his wife's. The right edge of sheet one, both edges of sheet two, and the left edge of sheet three are slightly jagged, showing where they were torn apart. White cloth gummed tape is still clinging to the right and left edges of sheet three; and discolored cellophane tape remains attached to the top, right, and left edges of sheet four, indicating that the separate sheets, now loose leaves, at one time were mounted in an album. Collation shows that the text of the Lincoln proof is identical with that of the uncorrected proof for the first edition at Harvard, previously described by Shannon (pp. 169-170). Pulled from the same type, the two proofs appear to have been printed on the same stock, though the dimensions of the sheets vary slightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">COLLATION In order to compare all the extensive early variants in the MS at Trinity College and in the galley proof at the Lincoln Research Centre with the readings previously collated and, in doing so, to take advantage of the latest methods for recording textual variations, a new collation is provided here, which emends and entirely supersedes that previously printed by Shannon (pp. 170-177). The techniques used are those established by Fredson Bowers, detailed in his article, 'The Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants', SB (1976), 212-264, and exemplified in his apparatus for the definitive ACLS-Harvard edition of William James's Works (1975- ). Documents The documents compared are listed below in chronological order of the state of the development of the poem that each represents. One or both of the authors examined the actual documents and verified the readings of each of the states of the text specified. As a matter of convenience and to save space, Tennyson is referred to as AT and his wife as ET. MS 1 Fragment of autograph MS, Harvard; described, Shannon, p. 167.

Strahan &amp; Co., 1872 Variant Readings This list comprises the substantive readings—the words themselves—in the known manuscripts, proofs, and published editions that vary from the authoritative text of the poem in the Eversley Edition, which Tennyson and his son annotated. Variants in accidentals—punctuation, spelling, capitalization, compound words, hyphenation, and devices of emphasis—are not included, unless they occur along with a substantive change. Variations in accidentals disclose Tennyson's attention to details and his tendency to increase the accuracy and formality of accidentals as he revised. Accidentals are, therefore, sometimes helpful in determining the order of manuscript texts. There is no question here, however, of establishing a copy-text; and since the instances of variation in accidentals without a change in wording are numerous and in the development of the poem not critically important, they do not warrant reproduction in themselves. For ease in comparing the variant readings, alterations in the manuscripts and variants in each printed text have been combined in a single list. An ampersand, 'w h ', or 'y e ' in a MS has not been considered a variation from 'and', 'which', and 'the' in a printed text; but when a variant line or phrase in MS includes an ampersand, 'w h ', or 'y e ', it is reproduced as written. In the same substantive variant from Eversley occurring in two or more states of the text, the accidentals often do not correspond; and where they are different, the accidentals of the reading shown are those in the latest textual state in which the substantive variant appears. The number introducing each recorded variant is the line number of the Eversley Edition (and Ricks, pp. 1007-1017). Numbers separated by a slanting stroke, for example 8/9, indicate a line or lines, as the case may be, that existed in an antecedent text but not in Eversley. The lemma—the reading to the left of the bracket—is that of the authoritative text. The rejected variants follow in chronological order to the right of the bracket. If the sigil—the symbol for one of the collated texts listed above —does not appear to the right to the bracket, the reading in that state of the text is the same as that of the final version, except for the partial MSS (MS 1 through MS 6 at Harvard), none of which contains a complete version of the poem. Failure of the sigil for one of them to appear to the right of the bracket means no reading where the lines are lacking in MS and agreement of reading for extant lines. (This possible ambiguity, which can easily be overcome by referring to the extant lines for each MS as set forth above, seems preferable to cluttering the Collation with incessant reminders in any variant line that it is lacking in several MSS.) Since the printed text of 52(a) is that of the first edition, variant readings in the print of 52(a) are not recorded. Readings resulting from AT's autograph alterations of the printed text in 52(p 2 ), 52(a), and 53(p) are distinguished as AT/52(p 2 ), AT/52(a), and AT/53(p). When these autograph alterations of the printed text result in the final substantive reading of the authoritative text (as they do in the majority of instances), the sigil is placed out of chronological order immediately to the right of the bracket for emphasis and to save space. The alteration is easily understood by comparing the last shown printed variant with the lemma. The accidentals in these autograph alterations frequently differ from the accidentals in the authoritative text, and no attempt has been made to record them. (Similarly with alterations in the MSS where a line or more was interlined, inserted, or altered, differences in accidentals from the lemma have not been recorded.) In five instances (ll. 8, 54, 91, 255 and 263) the substantive reading of the lemma existed early in manuscript(s), was altered, and then was reverted to in AT's autograph alteration of a printed version. For clarity in these instances, the sigil(s) for the text in which the early reading is the same as the lemma is shown chronologically immediately to the right of the bracket and before the symbol for AT's alteration of a printed text. Since AT added lines extensively to the poem throughout the various stages of the text (the authoritative text is 48 lines longer than the final text of the Trinity MS), a number of lines do not exist in the Trinity MS, in complete sections of a partial MS, or in several printed texts of the poem. Such lines are accounted for by the word omit , followed by the sigil(s) for the appropriate state of the text. Since a list of alterations in the manuscripts and elements of a historical collation have been combined in the Collation, the processes of revision are described in square brackets. In descriptions of alterations to the manuscripts, over means a correction by writing over a letter or letters of a word on the original line; interlined (abbreviated intrl. ) means added between lines. Above (abbreviated ab. ) positions an interlineation with respect to a word or group of words in a line which are usually deleted, but sometimes are not actually crossed out ( deleted and undeleted , abbreviated del. and undel .) Inserted (abbreviated insrt. ) refers to an addition in the margin or on the verso of a facing leaf. No distinction has been made between interlineations and insertions made with or without a caret or a guideline. In order to reduce the amount of calligraphic detail in the combined collation and to focus as much as possible upon the substantive alteration rather than the means of achieving it, the general description altered from (abbreviated alt. fr. ) has been used extensively. Other abbreviations are as follows: aft. for after , bef. for before , final rdg. for final reading, transpd. for transposed . The quoted text outside a revision in brackets is always the final version in a corrected MS. A number of readings, especially extended passages in the undeleted early drafts of the Trinity MS, are reproduced formulaically. In order to specify the words in the text which are affected by the description in square brackets, an asterisk * appears before the first word to which the description in brackets applies. Thus all the words following the asterisk and before the square brackets are part of the described material. When there is no asterisk, the description in square brackets applies to all the words of a reading preceding the brackets, or the affected word or words are within the square brackets along with the description—usually the record of a deletion. Where no words precede the description of an alteration in a MS or an autograph alteration in a proof, the description applies to the lemma. A vertical stroke | in a formulaic transcription signifies the ending of a line. A sigil, a dash, and another sigil (for example, TC-52) are used as a means of saving space to signify that a variant reading exists in TC and all subsequent states in which the line appears through the first edition (i.e., TC, MS 3 , MS 4 , 52(p 1-2 ), and 52). 1 Bury] AT/52(a); Let us bury TC-53 5 Mourning when their] AT/52(a); When laurel-garlanded TC-52 6 Warriors . . . pall] [ intrl. ] TC 6 Warriors] AT/53(p); And *the [ squeezed in ] heads of the people TC; And warriors MS 3 -53(p) 6 warrior's] omit TC 8-12 Where . . . evermore] omit TC 8 Where . . . deplore?] MS 3 -52, AT/53(p); Soldiers, ye with measured tread | Shall follow now his fallen head | To his last home among the dead. | Your chief shall rest in London's central roar.

Hallam Tennyson, 9 vols. (1907; rpt. 1908), II, 210-221. 4 Repetitions are of particular importance in a poem which twice makes use of the phrase 'Not once or twice . . .'; the phrase had occurred not once or twice but thrice in the first draft [223]. 5 It may have been some sense of a possible interference with the needed simplicity of 'leader', obtruding from 'follows' and 'leads', which caused Tennyson to delete on the Lincoln proof the lines: The host that follows, the host that leads, Banner and baton and mourning weeds . . . . [54/55] 6 Many of Tennyson's revisions were a response to the slipperiness of prepositions. Thus he deleted on the Lincoln proof a line found in the Trinity MS which equivocated with 'for' (in the service of / in order to gain): 'Nor fought for glory tho' he gain'd it' [218/219]. Tennyson likewise re-worded the unsteady lines in the Trinity MS on Wellington's life as having honourably glitter'd bare from youth To public comment till his latest hour . . . . [173-179; also 151-191] There the from / to sequence was misleading, since the sense was rather 'bare . . . / To'; moreover, 'till' suffered from the dangerous possibilities of the ambiguous 'till' in English (up to and including, or up to but not including). The American language has shrewdly adopted 'through' to resolve this difficulty. 7 Contrast the clarifying change reflected in the printed text of the Lincoln proof, from 'the'—which might have applied to the British—to 'their', in 'Their surging charges foam'd themselves away' (126). 8 For some other significant revisions involving 'true', see Collation 162, [173-179], [192-231], [232-281], 276. 9 For other revisions involving 'such', see Collation [80-150], [192-231], [232-281]. 10 On the Lincoln proof, Tennyson added the word 'and' ('With a nation weeping, and breaking on my rest'), and this too gave a less intensively interrupting rhythm. 11 The word 'great' figures significantly in many of Tennyson's revisions. 12 An intermediate draft in the Trinity MS had a nudging introduction here: 'Our archives have a name of might | Truthlover was our Saxon Alfred named' [151-191]. 13 The Trinity MS had not arrived at this, and moreover it had a clumsy he/him transition: 'Till he that sought but Duty's iron crown | On that loud Sabbath shook him down'. 14 The Trinity MS lacked lines 92-94 on this equipollence, lines which compacted it with the rhythm he/thee : '. . . this is he | Worthy of our gorgeous rites, | And worthy to be laid by thee;'.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91: Life and Milieu of the Scribe by George R. Keiser *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The increased scholarly interest in fifteenth-century England in recent years has made us aware that with the progress of education and the consequent spread of literacy in this period came a greater reliance by the middle strata of later medieval English society upon the written word for social, moral, and spiritual guidance, as well as for entertainment and personal communication. Economic prosperity among these middle strata, which was responsible for the progress of education, made of fifteenth-century England, according to F. R. H. DuBoulay, "a land in which men felt a sharpening self-consciousness about their social status." 1 A. R. Bridbury, in an analysis of this prosperity and its effects, has called attention to the development of "higher standards of domestic comfort enjoyed by classes which had hitherto been the drudges and minions of the social system" and "the quickening of their social aspirations," which are reflected in "the books of etiquette devoured by the new middle classes as they struggled with novel and perplexing social difficulties." 2 The anxiety inevitable in such an age "of ambition and upward striving," 3 as it is aptly described by DuBoulay, inspired the production not only of the etiquette books mentioned by Bridbury, but of an abundance of other books that must have provided social, moral, and spiritual direction, of which a fair number are preserved in manuscript forms which reveal that they were made for and often by members of these middle strata of English society. Among the many manuscripts still extant which testify to this new importance of the book for the middle classes is Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91, which, like British Library Additional MS. 31042, is associated with Robert Thornton, the apparent compiler and scribe. Although there were numerous Robert Thorntons in fifteenth-century England, a birth-record on f. 49 v would seem to establish that the manuscript was the work of Robert Thornton, a member of the minor gentry who in 1418 became lord of East Newton, in the wapentake of Ryedale, North Riding of Yorkshire. 4 This manuscript, to judge from watermark evidence, was copied between 1420 and 1450, 5 and was an anthology of at least 340 leaves in its original condition, containing narrative works, devotional and moral writings, and medical recipes—a veritable library, with its contents organized, more or less, according to their generic nature. Beyond the fact that it preserves, so far as we know, the unique versions of the Prose Alexander , the Alliterative Morte Arthure , and Perceval of Galles , this manuscript is of special interest as a document of literary, cultural, and intellectual history. In this paper I propose to offer a preliminary examination of its value as such a document by considering what the information concerning Thornton's life and affairs and concerning ownership of books in the area to which he would have ready access, as well as evidence from the manuscript itself, suggests about the availability and importance of books in late medieval Yorkshire, especially for those who, like Thornton, were members of the middle strata of society. Information concerning the life of Robert Thornton is sparse and what exists is sometimes of uncertain value. No private Thornton family documents from the period are extant. A family pedigree, which seems to attest to Robert Thornton's compilation of the Lincoln MS., was put together in the seventeenth century and published with corrections in the nineteenth. The original version, so far as I can discover, is no longer available, which is most unfortunate, for its compiler was Thomas Comber, Dean of Durham, whose correspondence indicates an interest in English antiquities (as does the fact that he compiled the pedigrees of the Wandesford and Thornton families, into which he had married) and an inclination to discover documentation when working in this area. 6 It would be most interesting to have the original version, for the published version disagrees at several points with information found in public records. Another difficulty in establishing the facts of the scribe's life is that the identification in public records is sometimes uncertain because Thornton is a common English name and there were several other Robert Thorntons living in Yorkshire at the same time as the scribe. 7 Fortunately, names in public records often include a geographical designation. Thus, in some of the documents the identity is certain because the name given is "Robert Thornton of Newton." In others, the identification is at least possible because no other geographical designation appears. Therefore, in the following discussion, even at risk of being tedious, I shall specify the form of the name appearing in each document, wherever I have had an opportunity to examine the original. Though we have no information about the date of birth of Robert Thornton, the pedigree indicates that he became lord of East Newton in 1418 upon the death of his father, by which time he would have reached his majority. While the authority of the pedigree is dubious at other points, it seems reasonable that in the absence of conflicting evidence we accept 1418 as a convenient starting point in searching public records for information concerning Thornton and assume that materials from an earlier time probably refer to his father, also named Robert Thornton. 8 Proceeding then to the public records, we find, first, that two entries in the Feudal Aids of 1428 for Ryedale indicate that a Robert Thornton ("Robertus Thorneton" in one instance, "Robertus de Thorneton" in the other) held lands in two areas within the wapentake, both within easy reach of East Newton. 9 Among the other names appearing with Robert Thornton's is that of Richard Pikeryng, miles . As has been noticed previously, there exists a will, dated 1 September 1441, in which Richard Pikeryng of Oswaldkirk, miles , bequeathed to a Richard Thornton "meam nigram togam furratam &amp; vi s. viij d. argenti" and to a Robert Thornton ("Roberto Thornton"), who is an executor of the will, "meam nigram togam furratam cum foynes." 10 The pedigree indicates that Robert Thornton of Newton had a brother named Richard, but as the original version is not extant, we have no assurance that the nineteenth-century editor did not add the name as a result of his knowledge of the will, a portion of which had been published a few years earlier. (It is puzzling to discover that the pedigree also reports, inaccurately, that a third brother, Thomas, was a recipient of a bequest in this will and gives 1444 as the date of the will.) Nevertheless, the close proximity of East Newton to Oswaldkirk and the mention of the rector of the church there—possibly William Eslake, a witness to this will—as a source for some of the medical recipes in the manuscript (ff. 288r, 291v, 292r, 292v, etc.) permit us to suppose that the legatee in the will and the landholder in the Feudal Aids are the same person, Robert Thornton of Newton. The Close Rolls record several property transactions at three different times—1443, 1449, 1468—involving Northolm and Great Eddeston, adjoining manors north of the river Rye and within ten kilometers of East Newton. In each of three quitclaim deeds recorded in 1443 the name of Robert Thornton of Newton ("Roberto Thornetone de Newtone") appears among the witnesses. 11 In 1449 Robert Thornton ("Roberto Thornetone") is witness to still another quitclaim; this same entry reports that those to whom an accompanying release of actions, plaints, and demands was directed included Robert Thornton of Newton ("Roberto Thorntone de Newetone"), as well as William, Thomas, and Richard, sons of the aforesaid Robert ("Willelmo, Thome, &amp; Ricardo filiis predicti Roberti"). 12 Thornton's appearance as a witness in these records, and especially in the latter document, raises the possibility that he may have had some particular relationship with these manors, and that as a result he may have come into contact with various Yorkshiremen associated with these manors, some of whom held prestigious rank and some of whom must have been fairly well educated: John Kempe, archbishop of York, subsequently archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor of England; Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury; Ralph, baron of Graystock; John and Nicholas Clyffe, chaplains in the city of York; John Thryske, mayor of York; Richard Warter and Thomas Ridley, aldermen of York. The release is of still further interest, for the information that Robert Thornton had sons named Thomas and Richard disagrees with the information found in the pedigree, where we find only one son, William, who must have been the author of the birth notice of his son Robert in the manuscript. The final entry in the Close Rolls, a charter dated 1468, to which Robert and William Thornton ("Roberto Thorneton Willelmo Thorneton") were witnesses, also conflicts with the pedigree, which indicates that Robert Thornton was dead by 1465. 13 Assuming that these witnesses were the Thorntons of Newton, it seems likely that Robert is the scribe, for it is rather improbable that the fourteen-year-old son of William would be witness to an important transaction and that, if he were, his name would precede that of his father. If this Robert Thornton is the scribe, it is especially interesting to know that his affairs brought him into contact with Robert Stillyngton, then Bishop of Bath and Wells, who would become chancellor of England in 1467 and who would testify to his interest in Yorkshire education by founding a school at Acaster in the East Riding. As the Close Roll entry indicates that Stillyngton had attorneys working on his behalf, Robert Thornton's contact with the bishop may have been only indirect at this time. At some other time, however, their interests may have brought them into more direct contact, for Robert Stillyngton seems to have been a relative of the two William Holthorps named in the release of 1449 and perhaps also of the William Stillyngton who, like Robert Thornton, was a witness to the quitclaim of 1449. Among the deeds published by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, we find three from the period 1418-1469 in which the name of Robert Thornton appears. One is a release and quitclaim dated 1436 and involving property in Newton-le-Willows, in the wapentake of Hang East. The first name among the witnesses to this transaction is Robert Thornton of Newton ("Roberto Thorntone de Newtone in Rydale"), who is most certainly the scribe. 14 The other deeds are a demise, dated 1450, in which a Robert Thornton ("Robertum Thornton") conveys lands and tenements in Cawton to a Thomas Crewer, 15 and an indenture, dated 1450-1, involving property in Appletonle-Street, in which a Robert Thornton is among the witnesses. 16 The identification of the Robert Thornton in each of the latter two deeds as the scribe is far less certain than in the first, but still very possible. If all or most of the references in the documents detailed above are to Robert Thornton of Newton, it would seem clear that by mid-century, now well into his middle years, as he had to be if he had reached his majority by 1418, the scribe must have been a man of some moderate prestige and influence, probably as a result of his landholdings, which presumably allowed him to attain a respectable degree of prosperity. Such an idea accords well with the fact that in 1453, Robert Thornton of Newton was one of six men commissioned to levy and collect taxes for the North Riding. By far the most intriguing biographical information about Thornton concerns his service as tax collector. An entry in the Fine Rolls for 12 June 1453 records the commissioning of Robert Thornton of Newton and five others to levy and collect a fifteenth and tenth and moiety of a fifteenth and tenth in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In another entry in the Fine Rolls, dated 9 May 1454, we find these same six men once more commissioned to levy and collect the same tax. From this second commission we learn that four of the original six, including Robert Thornton of Newton ("Roberto Thorntone de Newetone"), had earlier been discharged and replaced. The explanation given for the discharge is entirely unspecific: "the king, moved by certain sinister informations [sinistris informacionibus] laid before him in chancery" had discharged the four and commissioned their replacements. The reason given for the discharge of the replacements and the second commissioning of the original tax collectors is "sure information that certain of the former commissioners had already levied and collected divers sums of money, of the said tax, by colour of the letters patent directed to them." 17 In view of the dates of the two commissions—12 June 1453 and 9 May 1454—we can reasonably assume that Thornton and the others may have been touched by or perhaps even involved in the important events that occurred between those dates. At the time of the first commissioning, the traditional Neville-Percy rivalry was coming to a head, and very soon thereafter it erupted in several very serious and violent disturbances in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Despite the appointment of commissions by the government to deal with the problem, tensions did not subside, and the North Riding continued to be the scene of riotous incidents through the autumn. It is important to recall the series of events precipitated by the mental breakdown of the king in August 1453, when these disturbances were in full swing. The failure of the king to recover by the time of the birth of Prince Edward in October led to an intense struggle for power between Queen Margaret and her supporters, on the one hand, and Richard, Duke of York and his sympathizers, on the other. This struggle culminated in the proclamation of York as protector on 27 March 1454. York's choice for chancellor was Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, whose appointment to that position on 2 April raises the interesting question of whether the "sinister informations" reported in the chancery might have concerned participation by Robert Thornton and the others in the disturbances in the North Riding, perhaps on the side of the Percy family. 18 Interestingly, we find that among the indictments prepared in June 1454, those listing the participants in an ambush on Salisbury and his family at Heworth, near York, on 24 August 1453 contain the names of Robert Thornton, franklin, of the soke of Catton and Robert Thornton, yeoman, of Brig or Pouncebelle. 19 While the geographical identifications clearly indicate that neither of these men is Robert Thornton of Newton, the similarity of the names leads one inevitably to speculate whether in a hectic period when rumor and accusation must have been rife, the latter might not have been a victim of a case of mistaken identity. If we must settle for mere speculation in the matter of Robert Thornton's discharge and reappointment as tax collector, we still have the larger certainty to which his original appointment and the other particles of documentary evidence lead us: that is, Robert Thornton was no bookish recluse in the period 1420-1450, during which he apparently copied the Lincoln manuscript. Rather, it seems that he had a fairly ordinary life as an active, though by no means a leading citizen of Ryedale and the North Riding. The fact that such a man had sufficient education and sufficient interest to copy a book of the size and range of the Lincoln MS., not to mention Additional MS. 31042 as well, seems remarkable, as does the fact that he was able to obtain access to such a large and diverse body of materials. And it is to an explanation of these matters that we shall now turn our attention. There are two possible explanations for Robert Thornton's education. Perhaps for Thornton, as for Thomas Rotherham, "gracia Dei, vir in gramatica doctus supervenerit, a quo ut a fonte primo instructi." 20 Or, Thornton may have had a more formal education at a school. Information concerning educational institutions in rural Yorkshire is very slight at present, but we do know that there were schools at Helmesley in the thirteenth century, at Hovingham in 1310, and at Malton in 1245—all three of which are within a short distance from East Newton, along the road known as Ampleforth High Street. 21 It is certainly possible that schools may still have been in existence in the early fifteenth century at one or all of these places, for the more we discover about literacy and education in this period, the more reason we find for giving credence to that seemingly bold assertion set forth by Alice Stopford Green in 1907: "Not only in the busy centres of commerce, but in forest or waste or clung to the slopes of the northern moors, the children of the later middle ages were gathered into schools." 22 Concerning the question of how Thornton obtained texts for copying, information from Yorkshire wills certainly suggests that a man in Thornton's circumstances, wishing to put together such a book as the Lincoln MS., would have found it possible, especially over a period of several years, to gain access to texts without serious difficulty. Testamentary evidence indicates that several people with whom Thornton was acquainted did own books, though we have no evidence that their books contained the particular items that Thornton copied. However, an examination of other wills makes clear that books similar to those from which Robert Thornton copied were in the possession of Yorkshire citizens of the sort with whom he might have had some social contact. Most of these books, as we shall see, were held by citizens of York, a fact that is not remarkable when we consider that in this period York was an important center of education in northern England. The cathedral of St. Peter, in addition to offering a distinguished program of lectures on theology, maintained both a song school and a grammar school, the latter having an enrollment of well over 60 students in 1369. 23 In such a place, the atmosphere must have been conducive to the growth of literacy and to a steady interest in books, a supposition borne out by the evidence of the Freeman's Register of York, which attests to the fact that the book trade was a steady and prosperous one in York in this period. Among those who specified their trades in entries in the Freeman's Register between 1327 and 1473, we find 38 parchmentmakers, 1 stationer, 35 scriveners, 13 limners, (1339, 1349, 1391, 1406, 1418, 1419, 1424, 1434, 1436, 1439, 1460, 1462, 1472), and 6 bookbinders (1343, 1362, 1410, 1425, 1450, 1451). 24 The educational opportunities and the interest in books in York must inevitably have had an effect on the intellectual life of rural Yorkshire. As J. N. Bartlett has observed in his study of the economy of York in the later Middle Ages: York was an important centre for the social life of the gentry of northern England, and the luxurious foodstuffs, skilled services, and the wide variety of manufactured goods readily available in York must have led many north countrymen to visit the city for pleasure and encouraged them to prolong their business visits to the city. Country gentlemen frequently made bequests to their favourite church in York or requested burial in the Dominican and Franciscan Friaries there, and a number owned property in the city, whilst some country families were related to the leading citizens by marriage. 25 There is little cause to wonder then that, where evidence is available, it points to a lively interest in books even in rural Yorkshire. One final matter before turning to a survey of testamentary evidence is the need to say a few words about the limitations on the use of wills for evidence of book-ownership. Margaret Deanesly, in the early years of this century, found 338 bequests of books in 7,568 late medieval English wills (as printed in nineteenth-century editions) and concluded that wills showed "the extreme booklessness of the population as a whole." 26 While we can hardly declare the reverse of this conclusion to be true, more recent studies of the subject provide some reason to believe that, at least from the last years of the fourteenth century, the book was becoming an increasingly important part of the cultural life of those in the middle strata of English society. 27 As has been pointed out, Deanesly founded her argument on the unfortunate assumption that testators offered full accounts of books that they owned. Comparisons of inventories, where available, and wills reveal that testators often do not provide such accounts. Unhappily, it appears that they frequently gave attention only to service books, which have special value for their particular nature, obviously of special importance to a person approaching death, or for sentimental reasons, if the books had been in the family, or sometimes for luxurious bindings or illuminations. Many wills contain references to "all my books" or "libri non legati"; others contain bequests of chests that may have contained books or simply bequests of "all my goods," among which there may well have been books. And we have no way of knowing how many books may have been given away or sold by a testator, afflicted perhaps with failing eyesight in later years, before the approach of the final illness. 28 In the case of Yorkshire, we have a further problem. The most readily accessible wills are those appearing in the several series published by the Surtees Society, which are cullings of the wills transcribed in various Northern registries. Many of the relevant volumes in these series were prepared by Canon James Raine, a nineteenth-century antiquarian, who has recently received some severe criticism for the shortcomings in his work. From the great numbers of wills available, Raine did choose many for the purpose of showing the distribution of books in late medieval Yorkshire. However, because he wished his work to have wide appeal and usefulness, he ignored many others containing brief notices of books in order to accommodate other interests, particularly genealogical studies, a subject to which Raine is at times obsequiously attentive. Nevertheless, until we have a census of books in all the wills contained in Yorkshire registries, we must depend primarily on Raine's editions for what evidence they offer. And as I hope to show, even that limited evidence is of considerable value. 29 Turning now to the evidence that Robert Thornton could have found texts for copying without serious difficulty, we find, first, that among the Yorkshiremen with whom those activities reported in public records brought him into contact several either owned books themselves or would have been able to provide access to books for Thornton. Both Archbishops Kempe and Stillyngton, the latter a benefactor of education in Yorkshire, had libraries, 30 although it may be a bit farfetched to suppose that a man of Robert Thornton's station could have gained direct access to an archbishop's private library. Still, we may suppose that Thornton could have had contact with other clerics who would have had easier access to the libraries of greater churchmen and who may at least have had books of their own. We can be certain that two, John and Nicholas Clyffe, who are named in the Close Roll entry for 1443, did own books. In 1456 John bequeathed to his brother Nicholas a missal and breviary for the remainder of his life. In addition to these and other service books, John must have owned still other books, for he made provision for the sale of "libri mei non legati" (TE 2.21n). Nicholas, who died later that same year, had not only the service books he received from his brother, but at least one other, an antiphonal (TE 2.202; YD 2.333v). Closer to hand for Robert Thornton would be the various rectors of Ryedale parishes; William Eslake, the rector of Oswaldkirk mentioned above as a witness to the Pickeryng will, could have been the source of the several recipes Thornton seems to have added to his copy-text of the Liber de diversis medicinis and attributed to the "Rector de Oswaldkirke." 31 A somewhat earlier rector of the same parish, Thomas Brauspeth, in a will dated 1434, referred to his breviary as his best book, probably indicating thereby that he had others (YD 3.382v). Of the laymen whose names appear with Thornton's in public records, we can be certain that some had access to books and that a few must have owned books. For example, William Gascoigne and Brian Stapleton, the members of parliament who were associated with Thornton in his service as tax collector, were men from ambitious families which had marital connections with such other families as the Scropes, the Rooses, and the Percies, whom we know did own books. 32 John Grenewood of Thresk, one of the men commissioned as tax collector in 1453, had two well educated brothers, both of whom had book collections. 33 William Overton, whose name appears in the Close Roll entry for 1449, bequeathed to his niece, a nun, "unum Primarium magnum cum coopertorio de damask coloris blodii" in his will of 1482-3 (TE 3.262). One would like to believe that John Hedlam of Nunthorpe, knight, is the same person as John Hedlam of Staynton, gentleman, who was among those commissioned to levy and collect taxes in 1453, for it is tempting to suppose that Robert Thornton would have been acquainted with such a man. (Nunthorpe and Staynton are neighboring villages in the wapentake of Langbargh, and Hedlam's will of 1461 names the church at Staynton first in a list of bequests to parish churches.) Although it contains no mention of books (or of any of the testator's personal belongings, for that matter), this most peculiar will reveals the importance of books and learning in the life of John Hedlam. Conforming only in superficial respects to the formulaic pattern of construction found in wills of this period, it is the personal expression of a widower facing death with the knowledge that he leaves behind several unprotected children, apparently still of a tender age. Most important for our interests, it is a work composed by a man immersed in the idiom and sentiment of vernacular devotional literature, such as that we find in the Thornton MS. Submitting to "the disposicon of God, his blissed moder Seynt Mary, and to all the Seyntes of Hevyn," Hedlam puts "the rewle and disposicion of all my gudes to the rewle" of several friends, especially "my worshipfull maistre and trusty ffrend Sir Thomas Dernton Priour of Gisburn": to se that my will be ffulfilled. Beseking you maisters and my most trusty ffrendes þat ye will att reverence of God, and for Goddes sake, do this for me, and for the welfare of my saule, and my childer, whiche is most in my mynde of any erthly thing, whiche I putt at my pouer vnto the rewle of God and his disposicion and to your rewle; which childer I gife hertly Goddes blissing and myn as fferr as Gode will graunte me power . . . . And I hertly beseke you to se my gudes that leves, aftire my dettes paid, to tender my childer þer with, and to helpe to holde tham to the scule with þe said gudes, als ferr as þai will suffice, for þai haue no nother gudes to helpe þam with, bot if God will of his mercy prefer þam in conyng, to the which I beseke God incresse þame (TE 2.247; YD 2.451r). Unquestionably, this is the writing of a man for whom books and education are an essential need in life. While the wills of his associates, where available, contain no accounts of books from which Robert Thornton might have copied his texts, other wills provide evidence indicating that such books were in the hands of Yorkshiremen of widely varying social position in the later Middle Ages. To judge from the information in wills, the books with the widest appeal were those containing devotional and moral writings of the sort that John Hedlam seems to have known well, and it is with these books that I shall begin my survey of testamentary evidence of book ownership. The frequent references in wills to the private chapels maintained by clergy, nobility, and gentry, presumably like that of St. Peter at East Newton, and to the service books kept in these chapels attest to the widespread practice of devotionalism and personal exercise in piety, in which the reading of inspirational works must have served an important part. 34 For students of the Thornton MS., there is special interest in the bequest of a book described as "unum librum devocionis cum Psalterio Jeronimi" by John Hayton, vicar of Manthorp, to Henry Kettilthorp, apparently another cleric, in 1434, for the St. Jerome Psalter (in abridged form) is also part of the Thornton collection of devotional materials (TE 2.37; YD 3.388r). Other bequests of devotional books, none having so clear a connection with the Thornton collection, include the following: "unum librum Anglicanum de Spiritu Guidon'" bequeathed by Gilmota Careek of York, to Alice, daughter of William Bows in 1408 (TE 1.352; YD 2.585v); 35 unum parvum "librum devotum cujus copiam habui de anachorita Lichfeld" bequeathed by Robert Wolveden, treasurer of York cathedral to John Appilton, apparently a cleric, in 1431-2 (TE 3.92; DC 1.235); "unum parvum Psalterium cum Ympnario et multis devotis orationibus" bequeathed by Magister John Gylby, rector of Knesale (Notts.), to his church ("praeter donata in vita mea") in 1435 (TE 2.51; YD 3.419v); "libros meos, qui sunt materiae moralis" bequeathed in 1436 by William Hayton, a York cleric, to various churches in which he held benefices (TE 2.57; A 19.16v); "unum librum Devocionum qui fuit patris mei" bequeathed by Thomas Dautree of York to his son William in 1459 (TE 2.232; YD 2.413v). Turning now to wills naming individual works that would seem to correspond to items found in the Thornton MS., we find that as early as 1393 a York chandler, Jon of Croxton, who may have composed his own will in the vernacular, bequeathed to his nephew a "quayer of Edmund Mirrour in ynglysch," one of the works found in Thornton's book (TE 1.185; DC 1.111r). This bequest in Jon of Croxton's interesting will suggests the possibility that at a very early time there was alive in York, among members of the merchant class, that same devotional spirit that, because it led to collecting the wrong sort of books, nearly brought the inveterate Lollard and illiterate London skinner John Cleydon to the flames in 1415. Although this popular work is still extant in a fair number of manuscripts—in Latin and French, as well as English versions—I find only one other possible reference to it: an inventory, made in 1448, of books in the personal chapel of Thomas Morton, canon residentiary of York, includes, "De j libro de Tractatu Sancti Edmund x s" (TE 3.110). It seems worth noting that the social differences of these testators attest to the wide appeal of this work. A book described as "unum librum de Sancto Spiritu" and bequeathed by Isabella Persay of York to Katherine Howme in 1401 may be a text of the popular "Abbey of the Holy Ghost," which appears in the Thornton MS. (TE 1.271; YD 3.63v). Only a small extract from the enormously popular "Prick of Conscience" appears in Thornton's collection; two Yorkshiremen who apparently owned complete versions of a work known as "Stimuli Consciencie" and "Stimuli Conscientiae in Anglica tractata"—presumably the "Prick"—were, respectively, Thomas Roos of Ingmanthorp, who bequeathed his book to William de Helagh, probably a cleric, in 1399 (TE 1.252; YD 3.23v), and William Revetour, a York chaplain, who gave his to Alice Bolton (TE 2.117; YD 2.238r). Books described as "Grace Dieu" appear with some frequency in medieval wills and are, as Miss Deanesly indicates, translations of de Deguilleville's Pèlerinage de l'Ame . However, there appears in the Thornton and three other manuscripts a moral tract entitled "Gracia Dei," and it may be that work, rather than a translation of the Pèlerinage , which was contained in a book described as "unus liber vocatus Gracia Dei et de Vitis Patrum in Anglico scriptus in pergameno" in an inventory of books belonging to John Clerk, a chaplain in a church outside York in 1451 (TE 2.151; YD 2.227r). Tracts on the Pater Noster were abundant in late medieval England, and it would be rather foolish to propose that the treatise ascribed to Rolle in the Thornton MS. is the same work contained in the following books: "an Englissh boke of ye Pater Noster, glosid, with Matynes of ye Passion" bequeathed by John, Lord Scrope to his daughter in 1455 (TE 2.190; YD 2.323r); "j librum scriptum cum Pater Noster" bequeathed by William Downham, York chaplain, to Robert Traumer, chaplain, in 1464 (TE 2.268; YD 2.488r); "j librum Anglicum de Pater Noster et aliis" bequeathed by John Burns, York chaplain, to the prioress and convent at Monkton in 1479-80 (TE 3.199n). However, in these as in other cases where the identity of the book mentioned is uncertain, the knowledge of the distribution of books of similar nature is still of some value. A popular subject for works intended to inspire meditative devotions in the late Middle Ages was the Life of Christ, especially that part known as the Passion. One of the more interesting works of this nature was Nicholas Love's "Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ," an early fifteenth-century English translation of the "Meditationes Vitae Christi," which was at the time ascribed to Bonaventure. Another translation of that part of the "Meditationes" concerned with the Passion, made in the fourteenth century, appears in the Thornton MS. and two others, bearing the name "The Previte off the Passioune." Elizabeth Salter, in a comprehensive study of Nicholas Love's work and other lives of Christ, has called attention to a number of wills that may contain bequests of Love's work, although in no case is Nicholas Love's name mentioned in the descriptions and the possibility seems to exist that some of these bequests may be the Latin original or "The Previte," which is ascribed to Bonaventure in the Thornton MS. 36 Nevertheless, some of the bequests to which Salter calls attention (those associated with Yorkshire) and others she does not mention are of interest, for they show the accessibility of the sort of work that is represented in the Thornton MS. not only by "The Previte," but also by the tract ascribed to William Nassyngton and numerous short pieces concerning Jesus. Among the references to such works are the following: "librum meum Bonaventurae" bequeathed by Thomas Dautree, York clerk, to his son John in 1437 (TE 2.61; YD 3.494r), and then by John to his son William in 1459 (TE 2.232; YD 2.413v); "unum librum de Passione Domini" bequeathed by Eleanor Roos of York to her great-nephew Robert Roos of Ingmanthorp in 1438 (TE 2.65; YD 3.529r); "j librum vocatum Bonaventura in Meditat', in papiro," bequeathed by John Burns, York chaplain, to Simon Palmer, apparently another cleric, in 1479-80 (TE 3.199n). An inventory listing several books of the sort we have been discussing is worthy of special attention. This inventory of the possessions of Elizabeth, widow of William Sywardby (of Sewerby, in the East Riding) was, according to Raine, made in 1468; thus, the widow Sywardby was a contemporary of Robert Thornton, perhaps even close to him in age. Like Thornton, she maintained a private chapel and owned books which, as the inventory reveals, she kept in the chapel, where she must have used them for devotional exercises. She was a woman of substantial wealth, and some of her books were very valuable, probably works she commissioned, even purchased at a bookshop in York (in which city she seems to have had close associations with several citizens), rather than works produced at home by an unprofessional scribe: De j libro Missali iiij li. De uno Psalterio feriato, legato, viij s. iiij d. De libro compilato in lingua Anglica de Revelationibus Sanctae Brigidae, inferius legato, lxvj s. viij d. De alio libro de Vita Christi, in lingua materna, legato, x s. De alio libro de Misterio Passionis Domini, in lingua Anglica; et j quaterno de Visitatione Beatae Mariae Virginis, viiij d. De alio libro de Meditatione Passionis Domini, compilato per Ricardum Rolle, iiij d. De alio libro de certis Officiis Divinis et Commemorationibus factis, legato, xxxiij s. iiij d. De alio libro de Vita Christi, compilato in Latinis, legato, xxxiij s. iiij d (TE 3.163). The similarities between the items in this list and the contents of the collection of devotional materials in the Thornton MS. are notable: the psalter recalls Thornton's abridged St. Jerome Psalter, and the works on the Life and Passion recall "The Previte," the tract ascribed to Nassyngton, and the minor works on themes from Christ's life. In addition, both Sywardby and Thornton were interested in the writings of Richard Rolle. 37 Finally, the widow Sywardby's interest in the "Revelations of St. Bridget" reminds us of the interest in revelatory material that led Thornton to include the holy widow's vision of Purgatory among his devotional materials and the Thomas of Erceldoune earlier in the manuscript. The point to be made from these similarities is that Elizabeth Sywardby and Robert Thornton, both residents of rural Yorkshire, clearly found in the book an important, perhaps even an essential means to spiritual fulfillment and that, as the evidence I have set forth in the preceding pages indicates, their interest in the book for this purpose does not make them by any means unusual members of their society. 38 Turning to bequests of romances and romance collections such as we find in the first 176 folios of the Thornton MS., that section of the manuscript which has received the greatest attention among modern readers, we find little evidence to suggest that Robert Thornton would have been able to obtain his romances as readily as he could have obtained devotional works. Bequests of romance books are rare in Yorkshire wills, and even those we find often are or may be in French, rather than in English. Therefore, all comments advanced on this subject must necessarily be very tentative. Proceeding cautiously then, I shall begin this discussion of the distribution of romances and romance-books and the consideration of how Thornton could have acquired the texts he copied in the first section of his manuscript by offering, for reasons that will soon be clear, a few observations on that near relative of the romance, the chronicle. Appearing with some regularity in Yorkshire wills are bequests of chronicles, such as the Brut , the Polychronicon in English and Latin, Guido delle Colonne's Historia Destructionis Troiae and other Troy-books, and unidentified chronicles, 39 which books were the ultimate source of many romances. These chronicles must have appealed not only to the sense of national identity that was developing at this time, but also to the moral concerns of those who wished "to see and beholde hem self in the mirrour of auncient stories, the which hathe been wretin bi oure aunsetters forto shewe us good ensaumples that thei dede to leue and to eschewe the euelle." 40 That, at all events, is what John Trevisa seems to have had in mind when he wrote, "all that is profitable needeth, and so for to speak, all men need to know the Chronicles." 41 One will, from 1391, which contains a bequest of a French Brut , is worthy of notice because it is the will of an educated man and lover of books who lived in Ryedale, only a few miles from East Newton, fully a generation before Robert Thornton began to compile the Lincoln MS. Magister John Percehay of Swynton, of the parish of Appleton, owned a substantial library for the time, and described the contents with some care. In addition to a breviary, and a pair of decretals, and "unum parvum Registrum de pergameno," John Percehay owned "alium librum vocatum Trevet, nondum plene scriptum" and "unum librum vocatum Petrum Blesanz" (i.e., either Peter of Blois' De arte dictandi rhetorici or, more likely, the letter collection ascribed to him), this latter book an anthology also containing "in certis quaternis de Exposicione Officii Episcopi, ac commissione Beati Pauli, et Transfiguracione Domini, necnon de Expositione Beati Job, una cum Vita Beati Lazari." It is especially interesting to find that in 1391 a man of Ryedale should have a library of works more learned than the romances, religious tracts and saints' lives in Robert Thornton's book, but not entirely dissimilar in nature. Also of interest is the fact that Percehay bequeathed the Trivet and the anthology to John Newton, treasurer of York cathedral and a bibliophile, and his Brut ("unum Brutum in gallico, quod est in manibus Thomae Slegill") to John de Scardeburgh, rector of a Northamptonshire village, who also owned a collection of books to which we shall give some attention presently (TE 1.164-65; A 14.27r-27v). Undoubtedly, John Percehay was not a typical resident of Ryedale. However, the existence of his book collection there in 1391 makes the existence of Robert Thornton's book 30-50 years later at least a little more understandable. Whatever combination of circumstances in Ryedale produced a man of learning with the scholarly temperament and love of books evident in John Percehay's detailed description of his library might also a generation later produce a gentleman with some learning and the enthusiasm evident in the labor Thornton devoted to compiling his manuscript. Furthermore, perhaps it is not too fanciful to assume that the presence of a man such as John Percehay can have an enduring effect on the intellectual life of an area. Finally, John Percehay's association with one of medieval York's most notable bibliophiles, John Newton, adds some force to my earlier argument that it may have been possible that men of his acquaintance—lesser clerics, in particular—might have provided Robert Thornton indirect access to the more lavish personal libraries of higher ecclesiastics. To return to the main subject: there is sufficient reason to believe that the writers of romances, particularly those represented in the Thornton MS., intended their creations to appeal in the same manner as chronicles did to the moral sensibilities of their readers and to suppose that they succeeded in fulfilling that intention. The author of the Alliterative Morte Arthure , for example, is quite explicitly declaring this intention when, in his prologue, he asks divine aid in telling "Off elders of alde tym" in a work that is "Plesande &amp; profitabill" (f.53r). Similarly, though less explicitly, the author of Sir Degrevante , after asking divine blessing upon his listeners, declares that it is appropriate for them to hear "Of beryns þat by fore were / þat lyffed in arethede" (f. 130r; cf. Sir Ysambrace , f. 109r: "Of eldirs þat by fore vs were / þat lyffede in are thede). In the same vein, the author of Octovyane states at the beginning of his romance: "Jhesu ffadir of heuene kynge / Gyff vs all thy dere blyssynge / And make vs glade &amp; blythe / ffor ful sothe sawis I will ȝow synge" (f. 98v). If a bequest in the will of Joan, widow of Ralph, Lord Cromwell, is any indication of a more general attitude, there is no doubt that romances were accepted as works with serious moral concerns: in 1434 Lady Cromwell bequeathed to the parish church at Lamley "unam aulam steynid cum duobus costerys de historia de lebeus disconeus" (TE 2.40; A 19.14v). That the romances, some of them at least, appealed to the moral sensibility of their readers seems an increasingly tenable argument, if we may judge from the direction of modern criticism. More important for the argument of this paper is the evidence of those few wills which contain bequests of what seem to be romance-books and which indicate the sort of persons from which Robert Thornton may have acquired his romances. Two particularly interesting wills in this regard are those of Thomas Dautree of York and his son John, both of whom seem to have been lawyers and also rather avid readers with a wide range of interests. In 1437 Thomas bequeathed to his son John "librum meum de Gestis Trojanorum, meliorem librum de Gestis Alexandri, quaternam meam de Cronicis" and to John Saxton ("clerico meo") "unum librum de Bello Trojanorum." Among the other works bequeathed in this will are a book of Vices and Virtues, several registers, a psalter, a primer, Pupilla Oculi , "alium librum vocatum Francisci Petrarcae laureati," the Bonaventure mentioned above, and a book named for its former owner "Scropp"—i.e., Archbishop Richard le Scrope (TE 2.59-61; YD 3.493v-494r). John Dautree, his son, shared the tastes of his father, for on his death in 1459 his books included "unum librum de Gestis Alexandri," which he bequeathed appropriately to his son Alexander, and "unum librum de Bello Trojanorum." In addition, his will lists the book of Bishop le Scrope (now known as "librum Beatus Ricardus le Scrop), the Bonaventure, a devotional book ("qui fuit patris mei;" see above), several law books, a primer, a psalter, a Brut , and a life of St. Thomas Martyr, and a register formerly owned by Chief Justice William Gascoigne (TE 2.230-34; YD 2.413r-413v). If the Alexander- and Troy-books in these wills are books of romances (perhaps even English romances) their presence in the libraries of Thomas and John Dautree suggests that their owners found the contents fit subjects for serious contemplation. It may also suggest that at least in the case of romances, we can assume a rather sophisticated readership. Elsewhere we find only a few other references to books that may be collections of romances. John de Scardeburgh, to whom John Percehay bequeathed his French Brut , had a substantial library at the time of his death in 1395. (Though a resident of Northamptonshire, Scardeburgh had Yorkshire connections that give his will some relevance to this discussion.) Two books appearing in his inventory may have contained romances. "Libellus rubius de Vitiis et aliis" may have been a collection of saints' lives, although one does find that Thornton's Prose Alexander concludes with the line, "Explicit vita Alexandry magni conquestoris" (f. 49r). Also, the phrase "et aliis" makes us wonder whether this little book might not have held a romance or two, especially when we consider that romances and saints' lives are often found together (see Cambridge Univ. Lib. MS. Ff. 2.38). Equally enigmatic is the listing "Quaternus cum diversis Narrationibus," which could be a collection of romances, since such works might well appeal to a reader who had a Brut and a Mandeville in his library (TE 3.6). Another intriguing bequest is that of "librum Angliae de Fabulis et Narracionibus" in 1433 by John Raventhorp, a York chaplain, to Agnes Celayne, "servienti michi per multos annos." Raventhorp's will indicates that this book was part of a library of more than ten books, mostly service-books and doctrinal treatises; it is interesting to find this book, which surely must have contained some romances, in this library and at the head of a list of bequests to a loyal servant, which concludes with "tabula depicta cum coronacione Beatae Virginis Mariae" (TE 2.29; YD 3.358). One other anthology that may have contained romances is described as "alium librum de Gestis Romanorum cum aliis Fabulis Isope et multis Narrationibus" bequeathed to the parish church of Brigsley in Lincolnshire in 1474-5 by Robert Est, a York cleric, whose library also included "Psalterium glosatum, de propria scriptura Beati Ricardi, heremitae" (TE 3.159-60; YD 4.100v). In a few cases, we find references to books containing specific romances; at least some of these may have been collections of romances designated, as is customary, only by the name of the first work in the book. In 1361 William Driffeld, York chaplain, owned one book "de Septem Sapientibus Romae, et Marcho filio Catonis cum caeteris contentis in eodem" and another "de Patre &amp; Filio Tyto et Vaspasiano" (TE 1.73; DC 1.33r). In 1405 Sir John LeScrop, who also owned a Bible and a French Grace Dieu (i.e., de Deguilleville), bequeathed "unum librum de gallico vocatum Tristrem" to his daughter Joan (TE 1.339; DC 1.138v). 42 Finally, in 1432-3 Joan, widow of Sir Robert Hilton of Swyne, bequeathed "unum librum de Romanse incipientem cum Decem Preceptis Alembes" to her sister Katherine Comberworth and "unum librum de Romanse de Septem Sages" to Margaret Constable (TE 2.24; YD 3.347f-347v). 43 As is readily apparent, information concerning distribution of romancebooks is scantier than that concerning distribution of devotional books. This fact itself would seem a significant indication that romance-books were not so readily available as devotional books appear to have been. To obtain his texts, probably from various sources, Robert Thornton may have had to take more pains than to obtain the devotional works he copied. Nevertheless, as the biographical evidence reviewed earlier shows, the activities documented in public records brought Thornton into contact with a wide range of clergy, lawyers, and gentry who might well have provided him direct or indirect access to books from the libraries of clerics and educated laymen from both York and rural Yorkshire. The final section of Thornton's MS. is a collection of medical recipes in the vernacular, entitled Liber de diversis medicinis . As I have noted above, the references in the text to the rector of Oswaldkirk suggest the possibility that Thornton may have acquired the text of this book from the rector. This possibility would seem to be supported by the fact that of the few bequests of medical books, all are in the wills of clergymen. John de Harpham, vicar of Outthorne, bequeathed "unum librum de Phisica" to Nicholas, a Beverley apothecary in 1348 (TE 1.49; A 10.329). In 1378 Thomas de Farnylawe, chancellor of York cathedral, directed that his copy of Bernard de Gordon's Lilium Medicinae be sold and "precium ejus detur pro anima domini Willielmi Tayt, de quo habui librum illum" (TE 1.103; DC 1.69v). William Duffeld, canon residentiary of York, Southwell, and Beverly, bequeathed a copy of John de Gaddesden's Rosa Medicinae to the library at Merton Hall, Oxford, in 1452-3 (TE 3.127; DC 1.273v). Nicholas Holme, canon at Ripon, bequeathed "unum librum de Medicinis" to Magister Oliver Blakwell in 1458-9 (TE 2.219; YD 2.399r). Finally, John Hurte, doctor of theology and a Nottingham vicar, bequeathed to King's College, Cambridge, "unum Phisicum, scilicet, Ysaac de Urinis, cum aliis in eodem" in 1476 (TE 3.221; YD 5.194v). This survey of books in Yorkshire wills hardly gives us cause to believe that a Yorkshireman afflicted with sleeplessness would, like Chaucer, "bad oon reche me a book" ( Book of the Duchess , 47) to fill his empty hours. It does, however, suggest that that range of the Yorkshire citizenry with whom Robert Thornton was associated in his public business could have provided him, directly or indirectly, with the texts of those writings which so engaged his imagination and interest that he copied them into the Lincoln MS. Furthermore, it suggests that his associations allowed if not ready access, at least such regular access to books that he must have been able not only to find texts without special pains but also to exercise some degree of choice in compiling his book. In this regard, it is interesting to consider that Thornton has divided the contents of the manuscript (with a few exceptions) according to their general nature, with romances and other narratives in the first part and devotional and moral writings in the second. An obvious inference to be drawn from the fact that he organized his material in this way is that Thornton had in his mind a clear distinction between the two general categories of writings he expected to collect and between the emotional and intellectual responses of a reader to each. Thus, we see in Thornton a man whose response to literature may be more sophisticated than that of the fourteenth-century compiler (or compilers) of the Auchinleck MS. (National Library of Scotland, Advocates' MS. 19.2.1), in which the indiscriminate arrangement of materials attests to a more wide-eyed view of the writings available, a view appropriate to an earlier time when reading may not have been such a common experience. A second inference, and one of considerable importance to the argument of this paper, is that because Thornton envisioned such a division of materials in his book from the beginning of his work compiling it, he must have supposed that he would have regular access to a variety of materials for copying. (These inferences, of course, assume that Thornton acquired his material on a piecemeal basis, of which I shall say more in a moment.) If my ideas concerning the genesis of this manuscript are accurate, these inferences deserve even greater emphasis. The Prose Alexander , with which the manuscript now begins, was not, I believe, the first work Thornton copied for his book. Indeed, I suggest that it was probably the last work copied and that it was copied after Thornton had, according to his original plan, completed his compilation of this book and had started work on B.L. Additional MS. 31042. The Alexander interested Thornton, but did not have a place in the Additional MS. which seems to have begun as a Spiritual History. It would, however, serve nicely as a companion piece to the Morte Arthure which, like the Alexander , told the story of the conquests by and death of one of the Nine Worthies. This explanation would account for two unusual conditions in the first 52 leaves. First, the large areas left for illumination that was never completed in the text of the Alexander have no counterpart elsewhere in the Lincoln MS., but they do correspond in size to similar areas in the Additional MS. (see, for example, ff. 4v, 7r, 7v). Second, it would seem to explain the fact that Quire C, containing the last part of the Alexander , consists of single leaves and that Thornton left several of those leaves blank, rather than returning to add charms for toothaches and other scraps of verse and prose. 44 If the Alliterative Morte Arthure was originally the first work in the romance collection, it is then significant that the first work in the collection of devotional writings (except for the minor pieces in ff. 176v-178v, which were added later to fill blank leaves at the end of Quire K) is "The Previte off the Passioune": From his study of dialects in both Thornton MSS., Angus McIntosh has concluded that these two works form a linguistically distinct group and that the manuscripts from which Thornton copied them "were probably the work of a single scribe." 45 I propose that these were the first works that Thornton acquired and that he acquired them at the same time and before he had any other works at hand. The manuscript itself provides some evidence to support this idea. In Quires D, E, F, which contain the Morte Arthure and the first part of Octovyane , as in Quires L, M, N, which contain "The Previte" and several other devotional works, the scribe used pinholes at the junctures of the marginal rulings, whereas in all other quires, he used pinholes at the outer edges of the pages. Furthermore, Thornton, who was given to idiosyncrasies, made adjustments in the margin sizes so as to reduce the writing area successively in each of the three quires containing the Morte Arthure . The adjustments are minor, but the effect is to shift the written material toward the center of the page, thereby achieving a slightly more attractive appearance in each successive quire. In Quire L, which contains "The Previte," he used a writing area of the same size as that in Quire F and, in copying the text of "The Previte" he is unusually attentive to observance of the right margin so as to achieve an attractive appearance. If, as I believe, he copied the Morte Arthure first and "The Previte" next, it is interesting that he chose to begin a new quire, rather than simply using the remaining leaves of Quire F. (The fact that the margins in these remaining leaves are not wide enough to accommodate the double columns of the text of Octovyane would seem to indicate that he did not have this romance at hand when planning the margins in this quire; similarly, the poem ascribed to Nassyngton is too large for the margins in the remaining leaves of Quire L, following "The Previte.") This evidence points to the idea that when Thornton began work for this book, he did so with a plan of organization that indicated complete confidence in his ability to acquire other materials, both narrative and devotional, for his volume. As I conceded at the outset, this paper is a preliminary examination of the value of the Thornton MS. as a document of literary, cultural, and intellectual history. The factual information is far from complete, and the ideas based on it must therefore be tentative. Nevertheless, these ideas do permit us to conclude that what this book reveals about its scribe fits well with what we can learn about the life and society of Robert Thornton. He was an avid reader and a man of industry, enthusiasm, and ambition. His reason for compiling such a book most certainly was a desire to preserve for himself and his family works that appealed to his tastes and that would improve and uplift their spirits and, in the case of the medical receipts, heal their bodies. In this desire he seems to reflect an attitude common to a society which, except for its poorest members, must have been coming to accept the book as a natural and even necessary aspect of its domestic life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Grants from the American Philosophical Society and the Kansas State University Graduate School have made it possible for me to undertake the research for this study. I am grateful to the following institutions for permitting me to examine materials in their collections and for giving permission to quote from these materials: Lincoln Cathedral Library, the Public Record Office, the Borthwick Institute for Historical Research, the British Library, and York Minster Library. An earlier version of this paper was read at the annual conference of the Medieval Institute at Western Michigan University in 1976. 1 An Age of Ambition , (1973), p. 61. 2 Economic Growth , 2nd ed., (1975), p. 105. 3 DuBoulay, p. 79. DuBoulay's analysis of these anxieties is astute and compelling. That education and reading provided an opportunity to deal with such anxieties is evident not only from the existence of books of social and spiritual etiquette but from the encouragement for further reading contained in them. For example, the translator of The Book of the Knight of La Tour-Landry (ed. Thomas Wright, E.E.T.S., O.S. 33 [1868], pp. 118-119) observes: "eueri woman it is the beter that canne rede and haue knowinge of the lawe of God, and forto haue be lerned to haue vertu and science to withstonde the perilles of the sowle, and forto use and exerse the werkys of thair sauement, for that is thinge aproued and necessaire to alle women."

Harleian Charter 55 A.43, which I did not have opportunity to examine until after writing the present paper, is a grant of lands in Ryedale and Holderness by Richard Pikeryng to Robert Thornton ("Robert Thorneton de Newton") and three others including William Holthorp of Eddeston, who is mentioned below. This document is a further indication of the close relations of the Thornton, Pikeryng, and Holthorp families. It is interesting then to find in MS. Rawlinson A.393 an unnoticed version of Thornton's Liber de diversis medicinis , which contains not only the references to the Rector of Oswaldkirk found in Thornton's version, but also marginal comments concerning the Pikeryngs of Oswaldkirk. 11 Calendar of the Close Rolls , Henry VI, Vol. IV, 1441-47 (1937), pp. 159, 189; Public Record Office: C.54/293 and 294. 12 Calendar of the Close Rolls , Henry VI, Vol. V, 1447-54 (1947), p. 111; PRO: C.54/299. 13 Calendar of the Close Rolls , Edward IV, Vol. II, 1468-76 (1953), pp. 28-29; PRO: C.54/320. 14 Yorkshire Deeds , Vol. X, ed.

I am grateful to Ralph Griffiths for having called my attention to these entries. Other evidence from the indictments drawn up in the aftermath of these disturbances is interesting but very puzzling. William Byngham of Brandesby, one of those discharged with Robert Thornton was among the malefactors in a minor incident described in formulaic and rather unhelpful terms in K. B., Anc. Indict., 9/149/9/6. The name of a John Capon, perhaps the John Capon of Uplethum discharged with Thornton, appears among the witnesses in K. B., Anc. Indict., 9/149/4/27. (A number of the others on this list—Ralph Fitz Randolph, John Wandesford, John Wyclyff, Ralph Rukeby, Thomas Monford—can be identified as Neville retainers: see A. J. Pollard, "The Northern Retainers of Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury," Northern History , 11 [1976], 52-69.) The witness list in K. B., Anc. Indict., 9/149/3, includes the name "Robert Thornton," with no geographical designation. 20 Thomas Rotherham, Archbishop of York (1480-1500), Statutes of Rotherham College , in Early Yorkshire Schools , Vol. II, ed.

Magister John Percehay of Swynton in Ryedale (whose book collection I shall discuss later) in a will dated 1391, made a bequest to "Alicae uxori Magistri Ricardi Scolesmaystri de Malton" ( Testamenta Eboracensia , Part I, ed. J. Raine, Surt. Soc. Publ., No. 4 [1836] p. 164; Archbishop's Register 14 [Arundell], 27v); in this instance "Scolesmayster" may be simply a surname. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the presence of two men with the title "magister" in rural Yorkshire. Professor Jo Ann H. Moran of George Washington University, who is engaged in a study of education in medieval Yorkshire, has kindly informed me of evidence indicating that these three schools were active in a later period: Helmsley, 1471; Hovingham, 1538; Malton, 1489-1508. Though we have no certainty, there seems a fair likelihood that one, if not all three places maintained their schools through the period under discussion.

The A/Y Book of Various Memoranda Relating to the City of York and Ainsty , f. 21r, at the Central Library in York indicates that the scriveners of York had formed a guild by 1425. Lucy Toulmin Smith, York Plays (1885), pp. xviii-xxvi, points out that the list of plays inscribed in this book in 1415 indicates that the parchment makers and bookbinders sponsored the Abraham play, while the scriveners and lumners (with the questors and dubbers) sponsored the doubting Thomas play. 25 "The Expansion and Decline of York in the Later Middle Ages," Economic History Review , 2nd ser., 12 (1959), 19. 26 "Vernacular Books in England in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Century," MLR , 15 (1920), 349. 27 See H.

B. MacFarlane, "The Education of the Nobility in Later Medieval England," The Nobility of Later Medieval England (1973), pp. 236-238. Of interest is the fact that when William Thornton recorded the birth of his son on f. 49v of the manuscript in 1453-54, he also wrote "William thortun armiger this boke." In what appears to be his will of 1488-9 the only book he mentions is "my newe messe buke," which he bequeathed "to the maner of Newton in Rydale to serve in Seynt Peter chapell to the world ende" (reprinted in The Autobiography of Mrs. Alice Thornton , p. 325). It would seem that both Robert and William Thornton passed the book along to another before their deaths. 29 That series from which I have drawn information for the following survey of book ownership is Testamenta Eboracensia , the first two parts of which are cited in notes 10 and 21 above. Also used in this survey is Vol. 3, Surtees Soc. Publ., No. 45 (1865). Hereafter, these works are cited as "TE" with the volume and page numbers following. Where I have had an opportunity to examine the original document, I provide a citation for the register in which it is found, along with the volume and folio numbers. In these citations "YD" refers to the York District Probate Registry, "A" refers to an Archbishop's Register, and "DC" refers to the Dean and Chapter of York Register of Wills. In general my quotations simply reproduce Raine's text; however, in those instances in which I have discovered misreadings, I emend silently. 30 E. F. Jacob, The Fifteenth Century, 1399-1485 (1961), p. 666, reports that Kempe owned books of theology and canon law valued at £ 263. 14s. 11d. In 1443 Robert Esyngwald, proctor in the court of York, bequeathed a number of theological books to his godson Robert Stillington (TE 2.91; YD 2.25or). 31 Although it has been assumed that Thornton's text of Liber de diversis medicinis is a unique version, I have come upon nine other manuscript versions. I hope to offer a report on their relations soon. 32 See, for example, TE 1.179-180, 252, 270-271; TE 2.65-66. 33 See the will and inventory of Thomas Grenewood, canon of York: TE 3.62-65; DC 1.203v; Borthwick Institute Inventory D/C 1421. 34 Though he does not discuss private chapels, M. G. A. Vale offers other valuable information concerning personal piety in Piety , Charity, and Literacy Among the Yorkshire Gentry, 1370-1480, Borthwick Papers , No. 5 (1976). 35 It might be noted that "Spiritus Guidonis" bears some close resemblances to the holy widow's vision of Purgatory in the Thornton MS., ff. 250r-258v. 36 Nicholas Love's "Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ," Analecta Cartusiana , 10 (1974), 17-18. 37 It is curious that we see, comparatively, so few references to the work of Richard Rolle in these wills. Most of those we find are bequests of his commentaries in the wills of important clergymen; see TE 1.366 (unspecified works in a collection of mystical writings); TE 2.78, 219; TE 3.91n, 133, 160, 199n. Two books and a quire of unspecified writings by Richard hermit are listed in a 1427 inventory of books owned by Henry Thorthorp, parson in the choir of York cathedral (unpubl. Borthwick Inst. inventory). 38 A survey of the distribution of service books, a matter beyond the scope of a study concerned with the Thornton MS. and analogous books, would make this point more emphatically. For example, Elizabeth de la Ryver of Brandesby, a member of a family with which the Thornton family had some acquaintance in 1408-9 (see Yorkshire Deeds , Vol. VI, p. 77), bequeathes "my Premyr and my Roulys" and "j Sawter" to relatives in 1454 (TE 2.174). 39 See, for example, TE 1.164, 209, 341, 370; TE 2.61, 226, 228, 232; TE 3.6, 133, 198, 221. 40 The Book of the Knight of La Tour-Landry , p. 4. 41 "Dialogue between a Lord and a Clerk upon Translation," An English Garner: Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse , ed.

Pollard (1903; reprinted 1964), p. 205. 42 Another book that may be a collection of French romances is one described as "unum librum de gallico de Veteribus Historiis" and bequeathed by Sir Robert de Roos of Ingmanthorpp to his son Thomas in 1392 (TE 1.179; YD 1.51r). 43 The identity of "Decem Preceptis Alembe" is unknown. It should be noted that the word romance has a very wide range of meanings in medieval England. The Register of Thomas Langley, Bishop of Durham, 1406-1437 , ed. R. L. Storey, (1957), II, 196, contains the 1421 will of Lady Maud Bowes of Dalton in le Dale, which mentions "j romance boke that is called The gospelles ," "unam romance boke," and "j librum that is called Trystram ." 44 Information concerning the collation of the Lincoln MS. will be found in the Scolar facsimile, pp. xii-xvi, but see also A.

      <field name="heading_text">Sir John Harington's Irish Journals by R. H. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very little is known about Sir John Harington's participation in the Essex expedition into Munster in 1599 and of his whereabouts during the early period of that campaign; and in recent years some questions have arisen regarding the attribution to him of the "Report to Queen Elizabeth, Concerning the Earle of Essex's Journeys in Ireland." 1 It is a document long considered one of the important sources of information about Essex's Munster campaign of 10 May-1 July, and because it is thought to have been written by Harington, it has been given a place of the first rank among the eyewitness accounts and in the Harington canon. An unpublished journal of the Munster campaign, which appears in a miscellaneous manuscript volume of Harington's writings, was found in 1933, by Ruth Hughey, among the family papers. This manuscript is now B.L. Add. MS. 46369; the journal appears in it on ff. 7-18r. It has been assumed to be Harington's also. 2 However, new materials, both manuscript and printed, not previously cited, provide answers to the questions both of Harington's movements in Ireland during that time and of the authorship of both the "Report" and the unpublished journal. They show that Harington was not with Essex on the Munster campaign and that he could not have been the author of either of the accounts. Initially, Harington was directed by his cousin Robert Markham to keep a careful record of events in Ireland: "High concerns deserve high attention; you are to take accounte of all that passes in your expedition, and keepe journal thereof, unknown to any in the company; this will be expected of you." In his letter Markham intimates strongly that Harington is to act as a collector of intelligence and will be expected to report to the Queen regarding Essex's performance. 3 Harington kept such a journal, and according to a later letter from him to Markham, he showed it to Queen Elizabeth on his return from Ireland, and then presented it to his cousin sometime in 1606. 4 In 1775 Henry Harington of Bath, a descendant of Sir John's, published the second volume of the first edition of the Nugae Antiquae , a collection of manuscript materials in the family's possession, most of which date back to Tudor and Stuart times. Among the documents published in that edition is the "Report to the Queen," and its attribution to Sir John rests solely on Henry Harington's editorial judgment. No other evidence of its authenticity exists. From what we know about young Henry's casual handling of his ancestors' papers, any ascription on that basis alone ought to be carefully questioned. 5 Richard Bagwell first noticed that the text of the "Report" in the Nugae paralleled almost verbatim an account in John Dymmok's "A Treatice of Ireland," but he accepted Harington's authorship of it and expressed the opinion that Dymmok's treatise derived from Harington's report. 6 L. W. Henry, looking at both accounts some fifty years later, was critical of errors in Harington's text but did not go so far as to deny its authorship. 7 In 1969, however, Timothy G. A. Nelson first became aware of the possibility that Harington might never have been in Munster and thus might never have written the "Report." 8 On the basis of an obscure statement in Harington's letter to his personal servant Thomas Combe, Nelson argues that the letter's account of Harington's movements in Ireland places him in Connaught at the time when Essex was in Munster, that is, from 10 May to 1 July. 9 Noting that the "Report" is an eyewitness account, which it definitely is, Nelson concludes that Harington's presence in Connaught during the period excludes him from being considered the author of the "Report." Nelson, however, was unaware of the existence of Dymmok's treatise and of previous discussions of it, and of other important material bearing on this question. And neither Bagwell, Henry, nor Nelson seems to have known of the existence of the unpublished journal. Additional evidence now establishes that Harington was not in Munster. First of all, it is curious, that, except for the "Report," Harington never, in any of his published or unpublished writings, makes any reference to his serving in the Munster campaign, though there are numerous references to his service in Ireland in 1599. 10 Whatever references there are to Munster are to his first journey there in 1586, as one of the undertakers for the colonization of the area. 11 In addition, both the Combe letter, in a better text, unknown to Nelson, and a letter among the State Papers for Ireland indicate that during the Munster expedition of 1599 Harington was in fact in Connaught till late June. The letter to Combe, printed initially in the first edition of the Nugae (Vol. I) of 1769, exists in an autograph version in B.L. Add. MS. 46369, ff. 45-48, in a somewhat different text. 12 In the passage in the letter in which, in the printed texts, Harington refers to having served in Connaught for "some weeks," the manuscript text reads more exactly "some vi weekes" ( Letters , p. 71; Add. 46369, f. 45r). We know that Sir Conyers Clifford's troops were sent into Connaught on 9 May, and undoubtedly Harington and his kinsman Griffin Markham were a part of that group. 13 The evidence of the letter indicates then that Harington was occupied in the West until at least late June. He seems not to have been with Clifford at the rendezvous with Essex in Limerick, in early June, but he did join Essex in July for the campaign in Leix and Offaly. 14 Another letter, which has gone unnoticed, also records the same fact. Among the State Papers for Ireland, it is from Harington to Sir Robert Cecil, dated 12 June 1600, and is a response to Cecil's request for a record of persons knighted by Essex. 15 In it Harington refers to a "breefe Iowrnall" through which he is able to answer Cecil's question. 16 He says, "What tyme my Lo Levetenaunt began his Iowrney to Munster, and sr Griffin Markham and I with his Trowpe of Horse sent to Roscommon in Connoght, but we herd the same moneth of the knightinge of a Capten called Mr. Rushe." Sir Francis Rush was knighted at Maryborough on 17 May. 17 This letter corroborates Harington's statement in the Combe letter, that he and Markham were in Connaught for the remainder of May, into late June. The two letters show clearly that Harington was not in Munster at that time. At first glance the published "Report" would seem to have a candidate for its author, that is, the mysterious John Dymmok; but a closer examination of the evidence tends to rule him out. Little is known about him. He may have been a member of the well known family of Dymoke, of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire. 18 Constantia Maxwell describes him as "probably" an official in Essex's employ. 19 A "John Dymok" attested a note to the will of Thomas Burgh, Lord Deputy of Ireland, on 12 October 1597 (CSP Ireland, 1596-1597, p. 417). If this person is our John Dymmok, he seems to have been in Ireland some time before the arrival of Essex. The provenance of Harl. 1291, Dymmok's autograph manuscript, is not known. It is not accounted for in C. E. Wright's Fontes Harleiani (British Museum, 1972), nor do the early catalogues trace it. The work was presented to "Sir Edmund Carey," probably some time after 1600, and contains a letter of presentation from Dymmok to Carey, f. 1r. 20 In it Dymmok describes his work as "These rude leaves in their fullness of imperfection . . . beinge abortiuelye brought forth in an other shape. . . ." 21 The "Treatice" is a pastiche of material on Ireland's geography, culture, and recent history, most of which is taken directly from Edmund Campion's History of Ireland, Richard Stanyhurst's "Description of Ireland," and ultimately from Giraldus Cambrensis' Topographia Hiberniae . 22 To that introductory material is added the narrative of Essex's movements, both during the Munster campaign and after, to 9 September, with a brief interpolated account of Sir Conyers Clifford's defeat in the Curlew Mountains in August. It is clear that the author of the interpolated account, whoever he was, knew Harington. He mentions him by name and reproduces in his text Harington's copy of the letter by the rebel MacDermon O'Donnell, which he must have taken from Add. 46369, f. 20r, where it appears in Harington's hand. 23 Taken as a whole, then, Dymmok's "Treatice" gives every evidence of being a patchwork of accumulated materials, pieced together from papers Dymmok accumulated while in Ireland. The Munster account itself occupies ff. 25v-33 of Harl. 1291 and is titled "A iornall relation of the principall accidents which haue happened in the kingdom of Irelande from the x. of maye vntill the ix. of September 1599" (printed in Tracts , II, 30-40). Differences between the two accounts have been commented on by L. W. Henry. 24 Space does not allow a full analysis of the more than forty significant differences between the two texts, but my own estimate is that in cases where differences of fact occur, the Nugae text is more exact and more in agreement with the other journals kept during the campaign (CSP Ireland, 1599-1600, pp. 37-40; Cal. Carew MSS., 1599, no. 304; and the unpublished journal, Add. 46369, ff. 7-18r). The "Treatice" tends to be more general in its documentation. Also, noticeably absent from the "Treatice" are the longer passages referring to Essex. For example the account of Essex's bravery at Cashel, in Nugae , I, 274, lines 14-18, is missing, as is the description of his glorious entry into Clonmel ( Nugae , I, 275). At the close of the text, a passage is missing, consisting of lines 6-21 in Nugae , I, 292, which describes Essex's survey of the site of the battle in which Sir Henry Harington and his troops were crushed. This absence is in addition to that of the closing passage on pp. 292-293, already noted by L. W. Henry. The omissions may argue for dating Harl. 1291 after Essex's fall from grace. Generally, the variants between the texts indicate that the two versions descended independently of each other, with the Nugae text representing a version closer to the original but marred by blatant errors in its extant printed version. In addition to the "Report" the unpublished journal in B.L. Add. 46369, ff. 7-18r must be withdrawn from the Harington canon. This manuscript volume, labeled on its outer cover "S r Iohn Harringtons own Mss relating to the war in Ireland 1599," was first discovered and described by Ruth Hughey (see n. 2). It was in the possession of the Harington family until 1947, when it and a number of other Harington manuscripts were obtained by the British Museum. 25 To assist in making its contents known, I have included a description of the contents of the whole volume as an appendix to this discussion. The journal, covering twenty-three pages, is written loosely in diary form, with entries divided by days, in a casual but quite readable secretary hand. The first three pages are in Harington's autograph, but the remainder of the text is in the hand of a copyist who appears to have copied the whole out at one sitting, as the handwriting shows gradual but definite deterioration as the journal progresses. That part of the manuscript not in Harington's hand contains marginal notations in his hand. Unlike other items in the volume that are identified by Harington as being his own, the journal is noncommittally labeled "A Iournal of my lords Iorney" and appears to be an account that Harington had copied out for his personal use and keeping. Its style is curt and direct, with almost no felicities of phrasing evident. Essentially it seconds the other known accounts of the expedition, but it also gives a much closer and more detailed view of day-to-day events. This journal presents a stark picture of the difficulties Essex had to face, and to some extent mitigates the traditional judgment of Bagwell and others that Essex's southern campaign was a foolish venture. 26 The authors of both the printed "Report" and the unpublished journal remain to be identified. However, it is important to recognize that Harington was not their author, if only to remove from the accounts that special significance they have been accorded by virtue of their being associated with Harington. While he was in Ireland Harington kept his eyes and ears open. As one charged to observe events there, he undoubtedly wrote a good deal, but he also collected intelligence bearing on the entire campaign, carried it back to England with him, and reported it to the Queen personally. 27 It is more likely the case that he was most anxious to have accounts of the Munster expedition, a campaign he did not participate in, and that both the "Report" and the unpublished journal are the results of his efforts to collect such accounts. And it is not surprising that, over 170 years later, young Henry Harington, laden with family archives and with a limited knowledge of his ancestor's whereabouts in Ireland during that year of 1599, would credit him with writing an eyewitness account of a campaign he never participated in, an account he could not have written.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix: B.L. Add. MS. 46369 The manuscript contains several hands, two of which are readily identifiable, that of Sir John, who has left us numerous autographs; and that of John Harington his son (1589-1654), who appears to have used the manuscript as a notebook and is thus responsible for the sporadic shorthand notes throughout it, placed between the lines of his father's texts and on blank pages. 28 A specimen of his hand can be seen in his autograph diary, B.L. Add. MS. 10114. In addition the manuscript has accumulated several other hands, including a table of contents in a later hand, and numerous mathematical sums and doodlings, characteristic of the way in which the Harington descendants defaced other manuscripts in the family's keeping. 29 The volume is bound in vellum, and on its front cover carries the title, in a seventeenth-century italic hand: "S r Iohn Harringtons own | Mss relating to the war in Ireland | 1599 [ sic underlining]." It measures 192 x 142 mm. and contains 66 leaves, 65 of which have been numbered by the cataloguer. On the inside front cover is the signature "H Harington," with the notation below it, "Above is D r Harington's signature, RHH." I have not been able to determine the identity of "RHH," nor to determine if the signature is that of Dr. Harington père or Dr. Harington fils, the latter being the editor of the Nugae . In the description of contents below, items which have been published are so indicated with complete references. Contents: ff. 1-2, a cropped letter bound in laterally, with conjugate leaves appearing at the back of the volume, at ff. 64-65, written about 2 June 1599, sending news in the anonymous writer's area of the campaign; the text of the letter consists serially, of ff. 2r, 64v, 65r, and 1v; the outer pages have been scribbled on, but one autograph note, partly cut away, remains on f. 1r: "M r hammond the [secon?] * 1599"; 3-5, miscellaneous shorthand notes, in the hand of son John; 6r, table of contents, with items appearing in Nugae Antiquae marked "printed"; 6v, blank; 7-18r, text of "A Iournal of my lords Iorney. beginning the 9. of May. 1599.", with the notation on 7r, "The substance of this is printed," undoubtedly referring to the publication of the "Report" in the Nugae ; 18v-19, paraphrases of Psalms 42 and 50, in son John's hand; [A] an unnumbered blank leaf; 20r, autograph copy of "Mac Dermons letter," in Latin, dated 15 August 1599 (printed in Tracts Relating to Ireland , II, 47); 20v, blank; 21-23r, autograph text of "Report of my Iorney into the North to Iustice Cary.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The "Report" was first published in the first edition of Nugae Antiquae , ed. H. Harington, II (1775), 155-73; it appeared in the second edition (1779), II, 31-59, and in the third edition, ed. T. Park (1804), I, 268-293. Both latter editions are now available in photoreprint form, the second from Georg Olms of Hildesheim, Germany (1968), and the third from the AMS Press of New York (1966).

I am also grateful to the British Library Board for permission to quote from B.L. Add. MS. 46369 and Harl. MS. 1291. 2 Ruth Hughey, "The Harington Manuscript at Arundel Castle and Related Documents," Library , 4th ser., 15 (1934), 401. 3 Nugae , I, 241. Ian Grimble first suggested this possibility in The Harington Family (1957), p. 128. 4 Letters and Epigrams of Sir John Harington , ed. N. E. McClure (1930), pp. 121-123—hereafter cited as Letters . The fate of this journal is not known. The only surviving "journal" is B.L. 46369, which has gone unnoticed to date, but its contents are so miscellaneous that it does not seem to be the copy Harington kept for the Queen. Curiously, also, it contains no record of Harington's activities while stationed in Connaught from 9 May to late June. It seems inconceivable that Harington would have kept no record of that period, when he was specifically charged with doing so. The Harington journal may have remained in the Markham family, or it may have been destroyed by Henry Harington in his preparation of material for the Nugae Antiquae . 5 Ruth Hughey comments on his mishandling of the papers in The Arundel Harington Manuscript of Tudor Poetry (1960), I, 18. 6 Ireland under the Tudors (1890), III, 323, n. 1; John Dymmok, "A Treatice of Ireland," printed in the Irish Archaeological Society's Tracts Relating to Ireland , ed. R. Butler (1841-43), II, 30-40. The original is Dymmok's autograph text in B.L. Harl. MS. 1291. The printed text contains only a very few minor errors. 7 "Contemporary Sources for Essex's Lieutenancy in Ireland," Irish Historical Studies , 11 (1958), 8-10. 8 "Sir John Harington—A Mistaken Attribution," Notes and Queries , 16 (1969), 457. 9 The letter to Combe is printed in Letters , pp. 71-76, in a text that derives from earlier appearances in the Nugae editions. 10 This is especially true of his tract addressed to Sir Robert Cecil, A Short View of the State of Ireland , ed. W. D. Macray (1879), pp. 2-3, in which he reviews his visits to Ireland. He mentions being in Munster in 1586, but in the account of his 1599 journey he makes no mention of returning to that area. There is also a mention of Munster in his "Breef Notes and Remembrances," Nugae , I, 176. Park dates the passage conjecturally at 1599, though it probably refers to his visit of 1586, in light of the evidence of the two letters, discussed below. 11 He and his brother-in-law Edward Rogers are named in CSP Ireland, 1566-1588, p. 113. 12 Nugae , ed. H. Harington, I (1769), 32-39. The second volume was issued in 1775. The manuscript volume is described in more detail below. 13 CSP Ireland, 1599-1600, p. 32. According to Sir George Carey's letter to Cecil, Clifford had an army of 3000 foot and "some horse." 14 Clifford was with Essex during June 4-8. See Cal. Carew MSS., III, 304, and Annals of the Four Masters (1856), VI, 2117. Harington does not mention being with Essex until the Offaly campaign. See Letters , p. 72. In Dymmok's "Treatice" both Clifford and Sir Griffin Markham are placed in Offaly in early July ( Tracts , II, 43). See also Bagwell, pp. 334-335. 15 CSP Ireland, 1600, pp. 233-234. The transcript given below is from the original document in the Public Record Office. The printed version contains minor errors of transcription. 16 This "brief journal" may have been the one given to Markham. It seems not to have been Add. 46369, as not all the information listed in the letter appears in that manuscript. 17 Nugae , I, 271-272. 18 John Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland (1835), I, 32-38. The additional pedigree of the Dymokes of Haltham lists a grandson of Sir Edward Dymoke of Scrivelsby, the King's Champion, as John Dymoke. This John Dymoke's second son is also "John Dymoke of Haltham, Clerk," who died about 1649 ( Lincolnshire Pedigrees , ed. A. R. Maddison, I [Harleian Society, 1902], 319). 19 Irish History from Contemporary Sources (1509-1610) (1923), p. 221. 20 Dymmok addresses him as "Sir Edmund." He is probably Sir Edward Carey, d. 1617, Master of the King's Jewels. He is variously listed as "Edmond" ( Vict. Co. Hist. , Hertfordshire [1908], II, 151; William Shaw, The Knights of England [1906], II, 85). 21 Harl. 1291, f. 1r. The reference to the work's being "abortiuelye brought forth" probably refers to Richard Stanyhurst's inclusion of his "Description of Ireland" and of Campion's history of Ireland in Holinshed's Chronicles (1577), Vol. I. 22 See Butler's notes, Tracts , II, 53 ff. and n. 21 above. 23 The letter appears in Harl. 1291, f. 40r; it is printed, Tracts , II, 47. 24 See Henry's remarks, "Contemporary Sources," p. 9. His characterizations of the accounts are not quite correct. Though there are glaring errors in the Nugae text, they are not the fault of the author, who L. W. Henry understood at that time to be Harington. Rather they appear to have resulted from Henry Harington's characteristic inability to read sixteenth-century secretary script with accuracy. It is quite easy to see, for example, how a novice might read "the generall latelie" for "the generall Ratehill" or "Juffe" for "Duff." In another passage Henry prints the following: "Untill the armie had passed, Amias Corphis, the rebell, neuer shewed himselfe . . ." ( Nugae [1779], II, 51). There was no rebel by that name, and Dymmok's text allows us to make sense of this otherwise senseless passage: ". . . until the army had passed Enescorfy the rebell never shewed himself . . ." ( Tracts , II, 38). What was a geographical location in the original became, to young Harington's eyes, the name of an Irish rebel. Almost all the errors in the Nugae text are of this class. Harington had the same difficulty with the Combe letter. In the Nugae text of that letter he printed "fiery Machue" for "fery mac Hue," "Lesly" for "Leshe" (i.e., Leix), "Jaytes" for "Ioyse," "O'phaley" for "Ophaley" (Offaly), revealing an understandable inability to decipher place names and proper names ( Nugae , I, 71-73; Add. 46369, ff. 45-46). 25 Hughey, The Arundel Harington Manuscript , I, 12, n. 5. 26 For a revisionist view of the Essex expedition, see L.

      <field name="heading_text">The Reliability of Simmes's Compositor A by Alan E. Craven</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For students of renaissance dramatic texts, Valentine Simmes is a particularly important printer because he produced numerous quartos, both substantive texts and reprints. Among the substantive texts which Simmes produced are Richard II (1597), Richard III (1597), A Warning for Fair Women (1599), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1599), The Shoemakers' Holiday (1600), Much Ado about Nothing (1600), Henry IV, Part 2 (1600), Sir John Oldcastle (1600), Hamlet (1603), The Malcontent (Q1 and Q3, both 1604), Doctor Faustus (1604), The Honest Whore (1604), and The Gentleman Usher (1606). In the decade during which these quartos were printed, the work of several compositors can be distinguished; of these, Compositor A, to whom fell the principal share in setting dramatic quartos, has been the subject of most interest. 1 In an earlier study, I attempted to assess the reliability of this compositor and suggested the kinds of errors which he might have introduced into substantive texts. 2 The present investigation adds to the body of evidence on which previous estimates of A's work have been based and provides an assessment of his work in texts printed several years later than Q2 Richard II (1598), the principal text used for the earlier investigation of his work. Two reprints in which Simmes's Compositor A had a hand provide the data for the present study. Q2 The First Part of the Contention (1600), a page for page reprint of the first quarto, was set entirely by Compositor A. 3 The other quarto, Q3 Henry IV, Part I (1604), a page for page reprint of the second quarto, was set into type by Compositor A and a second compositor. Certain pages of Q3 Henry IV, Part I contain a number of striking compositorial characteristics, particularly the heavy use of unabbreviated speech-prefixes which are not stopped, a characteristic first used by W. Craig Ferguson to identify Compositor A's work. These pages also contain abbreviated speech-prefixes punctuated with a colon, italic names in the (roman) body of the text (the copy for Q3 containing less than two dozen instances of contrasting italic for names or foreign words, almost all of which are found in the first sheet of Q2), and speech-prefixes which are expanded from an abbreviation to the full name (and, of course, regularly unstopped), as well as certain spelling preferences. On the basis of these and other kinds of evidence, the following 16 pages in Q3 can be assigned to Compositor A: C1 v , 3 v , 4, D2, 2 v , 3 v , E1 v -4, G3 v , 4, I1, and K1. The remainder of the quarto—62 pages—can be assigned to Compositor B. 4 (I regard three of the pages assigned to A—E1 v , G3 v , and 4—and two of the pages assigned to B—H4 and K1 v —as doubtful.) The principal evidence can be summarized for the sake of convenience as follows. Unabbreviated speech-prefixes not stopped: Compositor A—94 Compositor B—9 Abbreviated speech-prefixes punctuated with a colon: Compositor A—32 Compositor B—o 5 Contrasting italic for proper names in body (replacing roman in Q2): Compositor A—54 Compositor B—3 Abbreviated speech-prefixes expanded to full: Compositor A—74 Compositor B—10 Spellings of certain high-frequency words and capitalization and punctuation practices provide some corroborative support on individual pages, but the speech-prefixes and italicized names (except on the five doubtful pages) provide the surest tests for distinguishing the work of the two compositors. Certain other compositorial characteristics—for example, Compositor A's practice in some quartos of setting lower-case exits—are not found in the quarto. It should be added, however, that no patterns of evidence in the quarto raise doubts about the identity of either compositor. Collation of a reprint and the copy from which it was set can provide an index to both the number and the particular kinds of changes to which a compositor was habitually subject. Disregarding obvious typographical errors and variants in accidentals (spelling, punctuation, and capitalization), we can record the substantive changes which Compositor A introduced into the two reprints. A substantive change always affects meaning. Although most substantive variants indicate a textual corruption, a compositor's correction of an obvious error in his copy must be regarded as substantive, whether the reading produced is right or wrong. In the following table of variant readings between Q1 and Q2 of The Contention , set entirely by Compositor A, the first column shows the page and line number in Q2 and the second and third columns give the readings in the two editions. 6 The changes are classified as follows: substitutions, omissions, interpolations, transpositions, and corrections of obvious errors.

In the 2187 lines of the play, Compositor A thus averaged one substantive change in every 23 lines. (All line counts given in this paper are the actual number of lines of type in the quarto. When two speeches stand in the same line, the line is counted twice. Stage directions which occupy a separate line of type are counted, but the single word exit (or exeunt ) has been excluded from the count. Turnovers are not counted.) Compositor A's work in Q2 The Contention can be compared with that in the other reprint, the third quarto of Henry IV, Part I , printed four years later in 1604. Compositor A, it will be remembered, set 16 pages (C1 v , 3 v , 4, D2, 2 v , 3 v , E1 v , 2, 2 v , 3, 3 v , 4, G3 v , 4, I1, K1) of the 78-page quarto; Compositor B set the remaining 62 pages.

In Compositor A's work in Q3, then, a total of 21 substantive changes were made in 16 pages of text, 617 lines—an average of one change in every 29 lines. The changes introduced by Compositor A in the two quartos can be summarized thus: Q2 The Contention Q3 Henry IV, Part I Substitutions 36 (38%) 7 (33%) Omissions 26 (27%) 8 (38%) Interpolations 11 (11%) 5 (24%) Transpositions 8 (8%) 1 (5%) Corrections 15 (16%) 0 (0%) --- --- 96 21 By comparison, Compositor B's work in his part of Q3 Henry IV, Part I reveals the following substantive changes. Substitutions 17 (41%) Omissions 9 (22%) Interpolations 6 (15%) Transpositions o (0%) Corrections 9 (22%) -- 41 Compositor B thus made 41 substantive changes in the quarto, two of which (one substitution and one omission) occur in the stage directions. These 41 changes were made in setting 2327 lines of text—an average of one change in every 57 lines. Nearly one-fourth of the changes result from attempts to correct patently corrupt readings in the copy. Detailed comparison of the work of Compositor A with that of the other Simmes compositors lies outside the scope of this study. Yet Compositor B's work in Q3 Henry IV, Part I calls to mind preliminary estimates of the accuracy of the compositors who shared the typesetting of dramatic quartos. These estimates suggest that Compositor A was far more prone to alter copy-readings; he appears to have made about three times as many changes as Compositor S or Compositor B. 9 Additional qualitative studies of these two compositors are needed, however, before we can speak with any degree of certainty about their accuracy. Disregarding for our purposes the work of other Simmes compositors, let us turn our attention to the incidence of change in the work of Compositor A. His performance in the two quartos can be compared with that in another reprint, the second quarto of Richard II , 1598. 10 Q2 Richard II Substitutions 82 (59%) Omissions 30 (21%) Interpolations 14 (10%) Transpositions 8 (6%) Corrections 6 (4%) --- 140 Compositor A's work in the three reprints can be summarized as follows: 11 Edition Lines Changes Rate of Change Q2 Richard II (1598) 2628 140 19 Q2 The Contention (1600) 2187 96 23 Q3 I Henry IV (1604) 617 21 29 Although the body of evidence is drawn from only three texts, it is sufficiently broad to allow the conclusion that Compositor A in setting from printed copy was prone to making frequent substantive changes. It seems safe to assume that a compositor's accuracy in setting a reprint can provide a rough index to his accuracy in setting a substantive text and that the kinds of errors which occur in a reprint can suggest those likely to be found in the same compositor's work in a substantive text. We can infer that Compositor A probably also made frequent changes when setting from manuscript, but we should guard against the assumption that the rate of change was necessarily the same. The corruptions in the reprints cannot have resulted, in general, from misreadings of copy but, as we shall see, are for the most part memorial in origin. In setting from manuscript, he could have worked more slowly, taking less material into his head, and consequently have reproduced his copy more accurately. On the other hand, he almost certainly would have introduced some corruptions resulting from misreading the manuscript copy, although the number of such corruptions cannot even be guessed at and probably would have varied widely from manuscript to manuscript, depending on legibility. What has not been fully appreciated about the quarto plays printed by Simmes—at least those in which Compositor A had a hand—is that they contain numerous substantive errors. McKerrow's oft-quoted statement that Much Ado was "one of the few Shakespeare play books that was decently printed" has suggested that Simmes's dramatic quartos were also accurately printed. It is true, of course, that the quartos are generally uncluttered and neat in appearance; few turned letters, obvious misprints, or mechanical errors are evident. It has been pointed out in a discussion of Simmes's proof-correction that "when copies of Simmes books are collated, variations are seldom found, and the texts are reasonably correct." 12 But, of course, absence of textual variants proves nothing about the scope or quality of proofcorrection. Indeed, as I have tried to show elsewhere, Simmes's proof-correction appears to have been far from thorough, to have varied widely from quarto to quarto, and to have been more concerned with the appearance of the page than with textual fidelity. 13 Because Compositor A did so often alter copy-readings in setting dramatic quartos, it is important to investigate the specific ways in which he violated the integrity of his text, as an indication of the kinds of corruption that we might expect to find in substantive editions. SUBSTITUTIONS . Compositor A was especially prone to errors of substitution. In Q2 Richard II the percentage of substitutions is very high. It seems reasonable to suppose that A worked more rapidly when setting verse —particularly verse from printed copy—taking whole lines of material into his head rather than phrases and thus sometimes misrepresented his copy. The errors of substitution in Q2 Richard II , a text entirely in verse, suggest that Compositor A was more likely to substitute words when setting verse than when setting prose. In substantive texts set by Compositor A we should perhaps expect these verbal substitutions to occur more frequently in verse passages than in prose. In all three reprints, whether in verse passages or prose, certain characteristic substitutions can be observed. When Compositor A substituted verbs or nouns, the substituted word was usually close enough in meaning to the original to keep the general sense of the passage, as the following examples (drawn from all three reprints) show: sayd for speake , drop for fall , see for reade, heard for seene; smoke for shocke, prison for person, slaughter for slaunder , suertie for baile . Substituted words were, however, not usually nouns and verbs, but instead were connectives and qualifiers (conjunctions, prepositions, articles, pronouns, and, less frequently, adjectives and adverbs). The single most common type of substitution involved pronouns: one pronoun substituted for another, the for a pronoun, or a pronoun for the . Of the 82 substitutions in Q2 Richard II , 20 were of this type; in Q2 The Contention 6 of 36 substitutions involved a pronoun. In the three texts the pronouns most frequently substituted or substituted for were my and thy . In general, substitution of one word for another is likely to reflect memorial error. The frequency of substitutions suggests that Compositor A characteristically took more material into his head than he could handle. 14 Not all of the substitutions introduced by Compositor A, of course, were memorial in origin. Some substitutions can be classified as orthographic in that they involve, usually, the addition or omission of a single letter or the transposition of two letters. Errors of this type are more likely to have resulted from misreading the copy. Final -s , as we should expect, is the letter most often added or dropped. Twenty-two of the 82 verbal substitutions in Q2 Richard II are orthographic, 12 of the 36 in Q2 The Contention , and 2 of the 7 in Q3 Henry IV, Part I . It would seem, then, that only about onefourth of the substitutions introduced by Compositor A in the reprints were caused by misreading; the great majority were probably memorial. But whatever the cause of error, readings corrupted by substitution are almost always plausible; rarely is a reading self-evidently corrupt. OMISSIONS . Omissions of a word or words occur frequently in Compositor A's work. In two of the reprints it is the second most frequent type of error. In Q3 Henry IV, Part I the percentage of omissions is higher than that of substitutions, but the body of data is small and may be atypical. In the reprints the omitted words were usually connectives and qualifiers; pronouns thus affected were ones used adjectivally rather than as subjects or objects, and nouns and verbs were seldom omitted. The resulting readings almost never appear manifestly corrupt, although they inexactly reproduce what stood in the copy. In Q2 Richard II only one of 30 omissions produced an obviously corrupt reading, in Q2 The Contention only two of 26 omissions, and in Q3 Henry IV, Part I none of the eight omissions. In only three instances was syntax—and sense—seriously affected, twice when a noun and once when a pronoun was omitted. The faulty memory of Compositor A thus produced numerous omissions that subtly falsified his copy. It seems reasonable to suppose that compositorial omissions occur less frequently in the setting of verse, where meter should assist the compositor. In Q2 Richard II , a play entirely in verse, the 27 omissions which occurred in the text account for 21% of the total number of text variants. The percentage of omissions in the dialogue of Q3 Henry IV, Part I is far higher—38%—probably because Compositor A in 14 of 16 pages was setting prose. Although the sample is small—only 617 lines of text—we can conclude cautiously that Compositor A seems to have omitted words more often when setting prose than verse. Q2 The Contention is not much help in this regard since the Q1 text is memorially corrupt (a "bad" quarto); the verse is very rough in places and a good deal of prose is set as verse in the copy. It should not be forgotten that omissions in verse passages almost always affect meter. In a substantive text like Q1 Richard II , four-fifths of which was set by A, broken meter may provide a clue to a possible omission. INTERPOLATIONS . Like omissions, interpolations are almost always memorial in origin. Because Compositor A's interpolations are usually confined to the less significant parts of speech, corruption is almost never selfevident. In the three reprints, 16 of the 30 interpolations involve one of three words: the , a , or and . It is just such interpolations that we should expect of a compositor who seemed characteristically to take more material into his head than he could deal with. The percentage of interpolations in Compositor A's pages of Q3 Henry IV, Part I , principally prose, is unusually high. Although one cannot speak with complete assurance of the compositor's relative reliability in setting prose, it is difficult to avoid concluding that A seems to have interpolated and omitted words more frequently when setting prose but substituted words more frequently when setting verse. Like omissions, interpolations in verse almost always affect meter. TRANSPOSITIONS . Compositor A in the three reprints was not particularly prone to errors of transposition. The percentage of transpositions is remarkably similar in the three texts. Transpositions often involved a pronoun—6 of 8 in Q2 The Contention , 5 of 8 in Q2 Richard II , and 1 of 1 in Q3 Henry IV, Part I . In many of these instances the words transposed were pronoun and verb (or the reverse). All transpositions produce readings that make reasonably good sense. CORRECTIONS OF OBVIOUS ERRORS . Although Compositor A frequently falsified his text by introducing inadvertent errors, he rarely corrected unsatisfactory readings in his text. In only one of the three reprints is a significant number of corrections to be found, Q2 The Contention . In addition to the 15 instances in which he corrected obvious errors, he also corrected faulty Latin in stage directions on 21 occasions, although none of these changes has been included in the statistics. Analysis of the three reprints set wholly or in part by Compositor A suggests that his substantative texts were affected by frequent errors of omission and substitution which resulted in plausible but unauthoritative readings. The only effective check against Compositor A's characteristic errors would have been regular and careful consultation of copy by a proofreader, but all of the available evidence suggests that Simmes's proofreading was superficial and desultory. The specific information about this compositor—his reliability and his characteristic types of errors—has important implications for editors of Simmes's plays. Unquestionably, the dramatic quartos set by Compositor A present a less satisfactory reproduction of what stood in the copy than has hitherto been supposed.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The seminal work on Simmes's Compositor A is W. Craig Ferguson, "The Compositors of Henry IV, Part 2, Much Ado About Nothing, The Shoemakers' Holiday , and The First Part of The Contention ," Studies in Bibliography , 13 (1960), 19-29. 2 Alan E. Craven, "Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos," Studies in Bibliography , 26 (1973), 37-60. 3 Ferguson believes Q2 The Contention to be the work of two compositors, A and a co-worker, B. I have argued that the quarto was set entirely by A; the evidence is set forth in "Two Valentine Simmes Compositors," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 67 (1973), 164-166. 4 I have discussed the traits of Compositor B in "Two Valentine Simmes Compositors," as well as those of a third workman, Compositor S. 5 Compositor B once uses a colon to punctuate an unabbreviated speech-prefix on H4. 6 Appendix I provides a list of non-substantive, linguistic variants in The Contention , Q2. 7 Not included in the list of variants are 6 instances of an omitted word in a speechprefix ( e.g., Poore man . changed to poore .) and 21 instances of faulty Latin corrected in a stage direction ( e.g., Exet omnes . changed to exeunt omnes .). 8 Appendix II provides a list of non-substantive, linguistic variants in Compositor A's pages of Henry IV, Part I , Q3. 9 "Two Valentine Simmes Compositors," p. 170-171. In setting part of Q3 Richard II , Compositor S averaged one change every 51 lines. Compositor B, on the other hand, averaged one change every 66 lines in his part of Q3 Richard II and in Q3 Henry IV, Part I one change every 57 lines. The figures here given for S and B differ slightly from those reported in the earlier study. 10 "Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos," pp. 49-55. The classification of substantive variants used in this early study of Compositor A has been reworked, producing the revised table of Q2 Richard II variants which appears in the body of my text. Some variants which I no longer believe admissable as substantive have been excluded from consideration. 11 The work of Compositor A can also be identified in a reissued sheet of 2 Henry IV (1600). In resetting 164 lines, A made 9 substantive changes, an average of one in every 18 lines. See Charlton Hinman, "Shakespeare's Text—Then, Now and Tomorrow," Shakespeare Survey , 18 (1965), 26-27. 12 W.

      <field name="heading_text">A Technique of Headline Analysis, with Application to Shakespeares Sonnets , 1609 by Randall McLeod</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the 18th century collation has been a standard procedure in editing Shakespeare. At first it sought lexical differences between editions; but recently variation within the same edition has come into focus, largely through the work of the late Charlton Hinman. 1 His mechanical collator and its adaptations 2 have revolutionized collation. Instead of comparing words one at a time in two different exemplars of an edition, it compares whole pages simultaneously as visual gestalts, making obvious even minor differences between them, such as unequal inking and change of type or damage to it. Let me illustrate the principle with an example from Shakespeares Sonnets , 1609 that has hitherto escaped notice, and in the process introduce a photographic method of collation that does not employ expensive mechanical collators. The title page of the Q1 of 1609 has long been known to have two imprints. In the account of Hyder Rollins, the authoritative Variorum editor, the title pages "represent an identical setting of type except for the imprints." 3 What happens when we move beyond the unaided eye and superimpose the images, however, contradicts Rollins' assessment, as the following plates will show. Before I analyze their evidence let me describe the simple process by which these images are obtained. I began with photocopies of the title pages of the two imprints generously supplied by Curator Carey S. Bliss of the Huntington. As the Library photographed them in slightly different magnification, one of the images was copied again, and this served to bring them to size. (Photocopiers rarely conserve the size of the original.) This experimental process of changing the magnification was repeated with the photocopier stocked with transparencies rather than opaque paper. 4 The resulting transparent image of the one imprint was then placed over the opaque image of the other supplied by the Library, and the two images were tested for alignment. This securing of alignment is cumbersome in mechanical collators, especially as in the present case when different parts of the page align on different axes, but hand-held images offer no such problems. Once a significant alignment had been found, the two pages were placed transparency-down on a photocopier to make an image of the superimposition. In the first illustration (Pl. 2) the alignment is of the ornament and 'SHAK' at the top of the page. The alignment in the second illustration (Pl. 3) is toward the bottom of the page (as in the colinearity of the rules). 5 The alteration of the imprint, long known, seems to have been accompanied by something never guessed at. First there is horizontal and vertical displacement of rows of type between the two images, although identical letterpress is found in common text. The horizontal movement might, to some degree, be explained by application of different pressures in locking up the forme after the change of imprint (for collation of the surviving title pages reveals that the gross differences observed here correspond to the change of imprint). But the vertical displacement of type can be explained only by the transposing of a reglet from above to below 'SONNETS.'—or vice versa. This alteration occurs in conjunction with another, revealed by the fact that the two images of 'SHAKE-SPEARES' do not fully align with each other (see Pl. 2). This evidence can be readily understood by another manipulation of the photoimages (a procedure impossible on mechanical collators). The following plate is made as the former two except that the transparency is turned over and rotated 180° with the result that the two imprints can be contrasted as mirror images along some useful axis, here the base line. The images can be shifted slightly along this axis in order to align mirror images of particular types or type groups. Plate 4 shows two such different alignments. The explanation of the misalignment is now obvious: the first and third E's in the name have been interchanged; this feature, like that of the transposing of the reglet, coincides with the change in imprint. In the Wright title the first E (that in 'SHAKE') has a slightly narrower set than the two E's in 'SPEARE' and may represent a different fount. In the Aspley title this E with the narrower body is transposed with the second E of 'SPEARES'. The difference in the bodies of these transposed types throws off the alignment of '-SPEARES' up to the final S by altering the spacing before the hyphen. Of course, there is no change in length of the whole line. The order of these changes, which coincide with the unlocking and adjustment of the page to alter the imprint, is not to be determined by strict bibliographical evidence. It is possible that in the unlocking of the page the first and perhaps the second line of type 'SHAKE-SPEARES | SONNETS.' pied and was reassembled, in the process the two E's being interchanged and the reglets rearranged. However, since the position of the narrower-bodied E in 'SHAKE-' in the Wright state of the title produces a more pleasing typographical effect than when it is the penultimate letter in 'SPEARES' in the Aspley state, it is also possible that the change was deliberate, in which case the Wright was the later imprint. The cause can remain only a matter of opinion: it is sufficient to state the evidence and to testify to the ability of mechanical or photocollation to isolate such minute differences between texts, differences unknown a generation ago when the Variorum Sonnets was published, a model of editing in its day. Let me now turn the techniques used here to a specific kind of problem that arises in close bibliographic scrutiny of any book—analysis of running headlines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Headline The first scholarly attention to headlines came over a century ago, 6 but the realization of their analytical importance should be dated from the work of Professor Bowers, beginning in the late thirties. 7 The usefulness of headlines in deducing aspects of presswork—one of its primary uses in bibliographic scholarship—has been called into question by D. F. McKenzie in his "Printers of the Mind." 8 But, his criticism is merely a salutory reminder that conclusions should be warranted only by evidence; the bibliographical analysis of the headline still remains valid as a technique. Now, headline analysis entails collation, but collation of this kind is not primarily between surviving copies of an edition (though this is still important), but within any copy of that edition. To save a compositor the labour of continually resetting them, headlines are usually repeated within their skeletons at varying intervals throughout a book. In fact, the earliest English printing manual, Moxon's Mechanical Exercises , 1683-84, stressed the importance of keeping intact the configuration of the skeleton (which includes the headline) when it moves from one forme or signature to another and is imposed about new letterpress. The recurrence of headlines can be readily ascertained when large type is used, as in Shakespeare's Folios, for damage or idiosyncratic features render the types identifiable. Gradually it was realized that, besides the evidence of typeface, the nonprinting types that space and justify the headline also contributed evidence—the lengths of their segments. In fact, such information proves invaluable in the present case, Shakespeares Sonnets , 1609, because the typeface is too small and the inking too irregular always to permit identification of single types. Traditionally headlines have been analyzed by the painstaking method (attributed to Charlton Hinman) 9 that entails exacting measurements of various parts of the headline arbitrarily chosen and then comparison with similar measurements from other headlines. As there are in the present quarto four new skeletons employed in the first four sheets, the analyst must accumulate a mass of data blindly before even a tentative analysis can emerge. Even so, as there are no exact margins to measure from, and as the inking is variable and sometimes makes two impressions of the same type slightly different in size or placement, one cannot be sure that the correct distance is being measured. Even with the discovery of a repeated headline in different formes, one is still far from knowing the correlations of the headlines in the forme mates. It is possible to collate headlines on the Hinman collator, but only if one possesses two copies (or photocopies) of the text and, of course, has access to a collator. Although individual headlines can be matched by keeping one copy fixed and turning the pages of the other copy one at a time while searching for correlations, the going is necessarily slow. In the quarto format headlines as part of the skeleton come in groups of four and are printed on one of the formes of a sheet; ideally one needs a method that compares such groups simultaneously, but the binding process forbids this formal simplicity. On the collator one fumbles with atoms when a molecular approach is required. To obviate these difficulties I have devised a method of photo-collation. This method has the benefit of displaying its evidence readily in the formats used in the plates of the present paper. The procedure is simple. A photocopy is made of the original text, or even, as in the present analysis, of a well-made photo-facsimile of the text. Before copying begins, the copy machine should be checked for distortions, and the copying should be done all at one time with the book in the same orientation and location. As light weight paper as possible should be used, for translucency is a necessity. The copied pages are now cut apart, trimmed where necessary, and loosely taped together in groups of four in the arrangement by forme they had on one side of each original sheet. This returns them to the molecular format mentioned above, and undoes the folding and cutting of the binder. The comparison of headlines grouped in formes can now proceed at a rapid rate. One simply superimposes any two of these reconstituted formes one over another on a light-table or sunny window pane. Then, with a slight shifting of one forme relative to the other, one aligns margins, individual words, letters or spaces in the headline. If no significant pattern emerges, one forme should be rotated 180°, and the matching repeated. Observation is often facilitated by interchanging the top and the bottom formes. Also useful is turning one forme over to compare headlines (one of which will now be in mirror image) along their base lines. These procedures will quickly reveal any molecular correspondence present. The following theoretical information and practical example show the great precision of photo- or mechanical collation in this kind of analysis. An individual typeface that is indistinguishable from others of its sort can sometimes be identified by the effect of its typebody (and the typebodies next to it). Printers have long been aware of the individual set of each piece of type even in the same sort in the same fount. Writing in The Printer's Grammar , 1755, Smith showed that the same words "composed out of the same Cases, without picking or chusing the Sorts" exhibit "a small difference in the thickness of the same Sorts in one word," hence "a greater might be discovered in a long line." 10 Smith's interest, of course, is in justification and in driving out and getting in, but the principle serves well those who wish to identify individual types. However much the two headlines of Plate 5 look alike by virtue of similar typeface and centering, the internal spacing of the typefaces as a function not only of their sets but also of any letterspacing present reveals decisively that they are not printed from the same array of types.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Headline analysis of Shakespeares Sonnets , 1609 This text collates [A] 2 B-K 4 L 2 . Jackson's analysis of the headlines revealed ("by careful inspection and measurement") that for B—K the inner and outer formes of each sheet were imposed by the same skeleton, but that several skeletons were recycled through the gatherings as follows: #1 for B and H; #2 for C, F and I; #3 for D and G; and #4 for E. 11 Overlay collation verifies these findings quickly. However, the real problems with the headlines of the quarto have not been touched: the headline changes from 'Shakespeares Sonnets' to 'A Lovers Complaint' in K; and L exhibits variation in the headline, as L2 v reads 'The Lovers'. 12 To understand the complete picture of the imposition of formes we need to consider bibliographic, not textual, units. As the solutions to the problems of K and L will prove to be interconnected, let me describe the problems of L briefly, and then proceed directly to K. Since signatures [A] and L contain only four pages each, we may suspect half-sheet imposition. The two common methods of such imposition either work-and-turn all of [A] in one forme, all of L in another; or work half of [A] and half of L together in each forme. Can we determine which method was used? To answer this question we need only remember that if headline material is shared between L(o) and L(i) we have positive proof that L was imposed by the second method. 13 Overlay collation and base-line mirror-image comparison quickly reveal decisive information to show that inner and outer L were imposed separately in two different formes. First, the headline 'Complaint' in L1 r and L2 r is identical. Second, the letterpress 'Lovers' is identical in both headlines L1 v and L2 v . Unmistakable are the large o and the slight misalignments of the letters. However, as noted before, the wording of the headline is changed, one headline having 'A', the other 'The'. In addition, the spacing between these different articles and the following word 'Lovers' is also different (see top Pl. 7). In any case, common types in L(o) and L(i) indicate that L was printed by twin half-sheet imposition (likely with [A]), using, as did the other sheets of the edition analyzed thus far, the same skeleton for inner and outer formes. The next question, simplified now that we know the imposition of L, deals with the provenance of its skeleton. Should we suspect derivation from that used in K, the only other setting of the same headline text? (If this suspicion proves true it would be an atypical practice, for alphabetically sequential formes elsewhere in Q do not use the same skeleton.) Let us enquire, then, about K. K(i) and K(o), reports Jackson, use the same skeleton. More accurately the skeleton of one is derived from the other, for as the following figure shows, only 50% of its headlining is textually the same. Overlay collation quickly reveals that the headlines common to both formes, whichever way the derivation went, are the non-conjugate pairs on the right side of the diagram of each forme. The headlines to the left of each forme do not contain common text, and so naturally we find no correspondence here. Now, if the imposition of L began when the latter forme of K had been machined, rinsed and unlocked, the compositor would have found his two required headlines for L ready-made in the conjugates K2 v -K3 r or K3 v -K2 r . But examination shows that this easy course of imposition was not followed. Let us assume, then, that one forme of L was imposed while the latter forme of K was not yet available for unlocking, and ask, Which forme of K was machined first? If K(i) were machined first, then the 'Complaint' of K2 r would be freed for use in L, as it would be replaced by 'Sonnets' in K1 r . If K(o) were machined first, then 'A Lovers' in K2 v would be released for use in L, its place being taken by non-printing types, spaces or furniture in K1 v . But obviously a complete running title could not be freed for use in L while either forme of K was locked up. Overlay collation and base-line mirror-image comparison of the letterpress of 'Complaint', common to L1 r and L2 r , show that it at least does not derive from K. The other headline presents a different and more complicated story. Collation of K2 v and L1 v shows immediately that, first, the word 'Lovers' in K2 v has all the characteristics that we saw in L1 v (and L2 v ). Most noticeable is the large o; second, the 'A' of 'A Lovers' in K2 v does not correspond with that of L1 v ; and third, the spacing between 'A' and 'Lovers', and also between 'Lovers' and the left margin differs between formes. This is all shown in Plate 7, which begins with the comparison of common letterpress from headlines in L(o) and L(i), and ends with comparison of the same letterpress in L(i) and K(o). We now have enough information to conjecture securely on the sequence of imposition of these formes and the provenance of the headline error in L2 v . Let us construct two hypothetical paths of the headline from K through L. The type of the headline in question must follow one of two paths: Path 1, K2 v →L1 v →L2 v , or Path 2, K2 v →L2 v →L1 v . Each hypothetical path contains two re-impositions. The evidence does not allow complete certainty, but the second path is much more likely. The first hypothesis strains credulity with its train of loss, accurate correction and subsequent miscorrection of the same part of the headline. The second hypothesis necessitates only one loss, erroneously reset, and then a subsequent correction, and thus does away with the awkward miscorrection. The following represents a probable reconstruction of events. The compositor unlocks K(o) and sets aside the headline from K2 v ('A Lovers'), or perhaps only part of it, as it is incomplete when we see it again. K(i) is then imposed and sent to press, where it remains when the compositor goes to impose L(o). The only headline already set and available that can be used in L(o) is that from K2 v , now incomplete. The compositor takes the remainder ('Lovers') and sets spacing and 'The' to go with it. We see in the choice of the article, perhaps, an easy confusion of the singular possessive with a plural form, an easy error, as the contemporary spelling "louers" does not distinguish them. The mistake is easy to set in this forme, as there is no setting of the correct title elsewhere in the skeleton. The proofreader can miss the error for the same reason. (The compositor also sets a new headline, 'Complaint', for the conjugate (L1 r ).) By L(i), however, the mistake in L2 v is noticed and corrected. Thus we can assert confidently that the order of formes through the press is likely K(o), K(i), L(o) and L(i). 14 This sequence argues strongly for cast-off copy in "A Louers Complaint." 15 Another source of information, recurrence of distinctive types in the text, can be utilized to show the probability of cast-off copy throughout Sonnets . 16 It remains to enquire whether Jackson is correct when he states, "naturally a new skeleton was constructed for Sheet K." By "naturally" I assume he means that as seven of the eight headlines in the two formes of K are different textually from any preceding headlines, those parts of the skeleton must have been newly composed. But could not a chase and part of its skeleton used in the printing of some earlier forme have been reemployed in K? There has been labor-saving recycling of skeletons between sheets ever since F, and one of the headlines in K does read 'Sonnets'. When applied to this problem, overlay collation shows that the headline of K1 r seems identical to that of E1 r . Normally when we compare recycled quarto skeleton formes we have four repetitions of identical letterpress, and uncertainty of identification of any one headline can be overcome by the corroboration of the other three. Nevertheless, the evidence of overlay collation calls in doubt Jackson's ascription, and suggests the recycling of skeleton #4 from E to K, whence it derived to L (see Plate 8). The argument has necessarily been preoccupied with the specific text analyzed. In conclusion let me stress the main interest, the general technique of analysis. The means of collation described in this paper is inexpensive and rapid. Its photographic format provides durable information ready for double-checking results and reporting evidence. Its reconstitution of the forme restores relevant spatial relationships of imposition that are lost in binding and cutting. Conveniently the use of photocopiers means that illustrations of bibliographic analysis, as in the present article, can be assembled rapidly and inexpensively from research materials. The method should be of use to anyone engaged in headline analysis. Finally, as the collation of the title pages of Shakespeares Sonnets demonstrates, it can double in a pinch for a mechanical collator.</field>

The present paper ignores all headline punctuation for the sake of simplicity. 13 See Bowers, "Running-Title Evidence for Determining Half-Sheet Imposition," SB , 1 (1948-49), 199-202, reprinted in Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 254-257. 14 When the last signature in an otherwise normal quarto is printed by the method known as "two half sheets printed together" or "twin half-sheet imposition," it is usual to print preliminaries to the same volume as its forme mates. Early printers' manuals, such as Stower, The Printer's Grammar (1808), p. 172, for reasons unstated, show the inner forme of one half sheet conventionally imposed with the outer of the other. We can extend our surmise, then, to the following order through the press: K(o), K(i), L(o)/[A](i), L(i)/[A](o). This implies that the variation of imprint was made during the perfecting of the last sheet for the volume. Strictly speaking the evidence shows only that L and K(i) derive from K(o); there is no absolute reason why K(i) must be printed before L(o) or L(i), though this would be normal (to clear a pile of unperfected sheets). 15 McKenzie, op. cit. , has shown that once we assume cast-off copy there is no necessity for setting and printing sheets in alphabetical order. Although this means we cannot prove that setting or printing of other material did not intervene between K and L, it does not throw doubt on the direction of derivation, from K to L; derivation from L to K does not account, for example, for why the 'Complaint' of L is not found in K. 16 Note, for example the titling capitals 'A' (Sonnets 23, 37-C1 v and C4 v ), 'O' (39, 54-D1 r and D4 r ), 'S' (65, 75-E2 r and E4 v ), (78, 93-F1 r and F4 r ); and the 'g' (55.3, 57.9-D4 r and D4 v ). These suggest only a probability because it is conceivable that copy was set seriatim and the composition halted at the end of the seventh page of these formes while the inner forme was printed off and its type distributed prior to the setting of the eighth page. The same 'g' reoccurs, however, in 115.13, 121.11-H1 r and H2 r , and an italic colon is found in 141.8, 145.3-I2 r and I3 r , two of some nine occurrences of an italic colon (there never being more than one per forme). These latter type reocurrences allow the confident surmise that copy was cast off and set by formes in Sonnets as well as "A Louers Complaint."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Compositorial Practices in Tourneur's The Atheist's Tragedy by MacD. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Cyril Tourneur's The Atheist's Tragedy has been edited in the scholarly Revels Plays series, 1 no bibliographical analysis of the original Quarto (1611), upon which any modern edition must be based, has hitherto appeared. Yet the Quarto is the sole source of our knowledge about Tourneur's practices as a dramatist and is thus of crucial importance in the prolonged controversy over the authorship of The Revenger's Tragedy , one of the most fascinating of all Jacobean plays and a key work in any account of English Renaissance drama. In its linguistic minutiae The Atheist's Tragedy has been shown to match The Revenger's Tragedy much less closely than does the typical play by Thomas Middleton. 2 As critics of this sort of evidence have remarked on the unfortunate aptitude of compositors and scribes to alter an author's colloquial contractions and preferred linguistic forms, the Quarto of The Atheist's Tragedy seems an especially appropriate text for bibliographical investigation. Anything we can discover about the setting and printing of the play is of potential relevance to inferences concerning Tourneur's orthographical style and comparisons between that style and what we encounter in The Revenger's Tragedy . The Atheist's Tragedy was printed by Thomas Snodham for John Stepneth and Richard Redmer. It collates A 1 B-L 4 (—L4). The title page, with a list of characters on the verso, is in fact the last leaf of sheet L, transferred to the beginning. 3 Careful inspection and measurement of the headlines reveals that two skeletons were used: skeleton I imposed B(o), C(o), D(o), E(i), F(i), G(o), H(i), I(i), K(i), and L(i); skeleton II imposed B(i), C(i), D(i), E(o), F(o), G(i), H(o), I(o), K(o), and L(o). This implies normal two-skeleton printing, with one skeleton imposing inner formes, another imposing outer formes, the association within B-E of skeleton I with outer formes and skeleton II with inner formes being reversed in E-F, and re-established in G, to be reversed again in H-L. The second of these reversals—that in sheet G—appears, even on a preliminary inspection of the text, to coincide with some bibliographical division in the text, though at first it is difficult to say precisely where the change occurs. The contraction I'll (as it is in modern spelling) appears 25 times up to the end of sheet F, 24 times as Ile (C2 v -F4 v ), only once as I'le (on C2). It next appears once on G2 as I'le , but then 3 times on G2 v and once on G3 as Ile . Then from 2 appearances on H4 v to 2 appearances on L2 v the invariable spelling (15 times) is I'le . The change from Ile to I'le thus seems to occur within G or H. Within H we find that for the first time many exit directions are preceded by a dash: beginning with a single instance on H2 v and ending with one on L3 v there are 16 altogether within sheets H-L; 3 entry directions are also preceded by a dash (on H3 v , K1, and K2 v ). Another change occurs a little earlier in the Quarto. Up to and including G1 there are 41 abbreviated speech prefixes for Castabella : 39 of these, including 5 on G1, are printed as Casta , only 2 as Casta (on C2 v and G1). On G1 v there are 5 instances of Casta , none of Casta , and the figures for G1 v -L3 v are Casta 16, Casta 13. Both forms appear on I1, I1 v , and I2. Finally, there is a shift from the indiscriminate use of -e and -ee endings, or a preference for -ee , in he , me , she , and we , to a strong preference for the modern spelling. 4 The following table makes this clear: SHEETS B-F SHEETS H-L me/mee 42/42 69/16 he/hee 24/42 20/5 she/shee 1/12 5/1 we/wee 6/10 9/4 TOTAL: 73/106 103/26 Sheet G has been omitted from the above table, for though the overall figures for F (22/36) contrast strikingly with those for I (42/7), the difference between G (19/13) and H (19/8) is barely perceptible. Fortunately one further item of evidence not only enables us to locate the exact point of change in the Quarto, but also allows us to be quite certain that we are dealing with a change of compositors rather than with some variation in the nature of the manuscript copy. The Quarto contains an exceptionally large number of semi-colons. These are regularly followed by a space. Within sheets B-F the semi-colons are not normally preceded by a space: of 221 semi-colons in B-F only 7 are preceded by a space, and 4 of the exceptional 7 appear in full prose lines. Within sheets H-L, in contrast, semicolons are normally preceded, as well as followed, by a space: of 240 semicolons in H-L all but 18 are preceded by a space, and 17 of the exceptional 18 occur in full prose lines. 5 The following table shows the situation within sheet G; for each page the number of semi-colons not preceded by a space is followed by the number of semi-colons which are preceded by a space: 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v 4/0 0/3 0/3 6/0 4/1 0/10 0/14 2/0 The pattern is obvious: for pages of the outer forme the total is 16/1; for pages of the inner forme the total is 0/30. Clearly, the Quarto was set by two compositors: Compositor A, who preferred not to precede semi-colons by a space, set sheets B-F and the outer forme of sheet G; Compositor B, who preferred to precede semi-colons by a space, set sheets H-L and the inner forme of sheet G. The evidence previously cited is consistent with this division. Casta on G1 is anomalous (though outweighed by 5 instances of Casta ), but the other 7 instances of Casta in sheet G belong to Compositor B's pages. Compositor A always uses Ile , except for one deviation into I'le on C2, whereas Compositor B always uses I'le . Returning to the -e/-ee spellings in G, we find that for the outer forme the figures are 5/11, in accord with Compositor A's frequent use of -ee spellings within the earlier sheets, while for the inner forme the figures are 14/2, in accord with Compositor B's tendency to avoid -ee spellings within the later sheets. The division of sheet G between compositors by formes proves that this sheet at least was set by formes, not seriatim, and suggests that the whole Quarto may have been set by formes. Miscalculation in the casting-off of copy, and a consequent need to conserve space in setting the text, might thus account for some of the "extraordinarily large number of verse passages which have been set as prose," and render unnecessary Ribner's postulating of a scribal fair copy intervening between Tourneur's holograph and the printed text. 6 The neatness with which copy was made to fit exactly nine sheets suggests that a fairly careful advance estimate was made of the amount of space the printed text would occupy. However, there is no convincing evidence from type shortage to support the supposition that the whole Quarto was set by formes, the mislined passages are not confined to, or even especially prevalent on, pages where a compositor'r manœuverings to compensate for miscalculations in casting-off might be expected, and no other undue cramping of the text or wastage of space is apparent, though the occasional use of a blank line above or below a stage direction may represent an attempt at minor adjustment. Actually, Tourneur's frequent shifts from verse to prose and back again within a single scene might well have proved bewildering to compositors, especially in view of the bold enjambments of his verse, which often make it resemble chopped up prose, and there is much to be said for Nicoll's conjecture that revision, especially to D'Amville's role, was a source of confusion. 7 Price and Murray both believe that the Quarto of The Atheist's Tragedy was set from Tourneur's holograph and point to orthographical links between The Atheist's Tragedy and Tourneur's non-dramatic works which suggest that Snodham's compositors were conservative in their handling of the forms in their manuscript copy. Murray further shows that while The Atheist's Tragedy shares certain significant spellings and forms of colloquial contractions with Tourneur's poems printed in other shops, Ben Jonson's The Alchemist (1612), the one play printed by Snodham within a year of The Atheist's Tragedy , exhibits spellings and colloquial forms differing from Tourneur's but characteristic of Jonson's late comedies in general. He concluded that Snodham's compositors were fairly faithful to the minutiae of their copy. We are now in a position to refine his argument somewhat, for of the two compositors who set The Atheist's Tragedy one, Compositor B, appears to have set the whole of The Alchemist . Semi-colons are again common, though less so than in The Atheist's Tragedy , and throughout the text they are preceded by a space. The single -e spelling is normal in pronouns (except in such forms as hee'll , wee'll , etc.). Spacing practices with respect to punctuation marks other than semi-colons agree with those found throughout The Atheist's Tragedy . 8 The orthographical differences between The Alchemist and The Atheist's Tragedy (at least its second half) cannot, therefore be purely compositorial in origin. More significant is the uniformity of the two parts of The Atheist's Tragedy with regard to orthographical features which distinguish Tourneur's play from The Revenger's Tragedy and Middleton's plays. Examining The Revenger's Tragedy , The Atheist's Tragedy , five plays by Middleton, five plays by other authors which were printed, like The Revenger's Tragedy , by George Eld in 1607-8, and also Snodham's Quarto of The Alchemist , Murray "determined both the frequency of occurrence and the spelling for all colloquial contractions of prepositions, articles, personal pronouns and verbs, and their combinations with one another" and also determined the frequency with which has , hath , does , and doth occur. 9 He undertook separate analyses for preferred linguistic forms and preferred spellings of them, presenting his data in five tables, the first of which records the spelling of the forms studied, w'are and we're , for example, being regarded as different forms of the contraction for we are . The upshot is that "in every one of the eighteen spelling conflicts between Tourneur and Middleton the pattern of spellings occurring in the RT is closer to Middleton's than to Tourneur's" (pp. 165-166). The present compositorial analysis of The Atheist's Tragedy gives these findings added weight. With the exception of Ile/I'le , none of the eighteen forms is treated in a significantly different fashion by Snodham's two different compositors. Murray shows, for example, that the contracted form of it is appears in The Atheist's Tragedy as t'is 50 times, tis once, 'tis not at all. In The Revenger's Tragedy , and four representative plays by Middleton, the strong preference is for tis , with ' tis as the second most common form. Of the 50 examples of t'is in The Atheist's Tragedy exactly half were set by Compositor A, half by Compositor B. In The Alchemist Compositor B regularly uses ' tis (38 times, tis once)—the form which characterizes The Revenger's Tragedy and Middleton's plays; so presumably he set t'is in The Atheist's Tragedy because that form appeared in his copy. Murray shows that whereas the verb does always occurs in its modern spelling or as doe's in The Atheist's Tragedy (16 times), the normal spelling in The Revenger's Tragedy and in four Middleton plays is dos or do's . Of the 16 instances of does or doe's in The Atheist's Tragedy 9 are in Compositor A's stint, 7 in Compositor B's. Yet in The Alchemist Compositor B shows himself perfectly willing to set the form which prevails in The Revenger's Tragedy and the Middleton plays: do's occurs 19 times, dos 4 times, does and doe's once each. In The Atheist's Tragedy 'em is the only contracted spelling of them —12 times set by Compositor A, 6 times by Compositor B. In The Revenger's Tragedy and the Middleton plays e'm and em are also common. In The Alchemist Compositor B invariably sets the Jonsonian ' hem —51 times. Even the Ile/I'le spellings, over which the two compositors differ in The Atheist's Tragedy , contribute to Murray's case, because the only alternative to Ile in The Revenger's Tragedy and Middleton, used about half as frequently, is ile . In The Alchemist I'll is normal (77 times), though Ile (16 times) and I'le (twice) also occur. I have been referring to The Alchemist as the work of Compositor B more confidently, perhaps, than the evidence warrants. If the play was in fact set by Compositor A, the argument in support of Murray's case remains unaffected, since both men treated the forms cited by Murray in almost exactly the same fashion. Even if The Alchemist was set, wholly or in part, by a third compositor, the Jonson play at least affords evidence that the uniformity with which two compositors spelled colloquial contractions in The Atheist's Tragedy was not due to the imposition of some strict printing-house style. The natural inference is that Snodham's Compositor A and Compositor B both reproduced the linguistic minutiae of their manuscript copy with some care.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Rare Restoration Manuscript Prompt-Book: John Wilson's Belphegor , Corrected by the Author by Kathleen M. Lesko</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Restoration dramatist John Wilson (1626-1695?) was the author of four plays, four poems, two political treatises on monarchy, and a 1668 translation of Erasmus' Moriae Encomium . There are extant also four personal letters in his hand. My recent discovery of these autograph letters at the National Library of Ireland has important ramifications for students of Restoration drama. The letters allow us to authenticate for the first time the handwriting in a rare Restoration manuscript prompt-book at the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C. Of the three surviving Restoration manuscript prompt-books two are plays by John Wilson. 1 In 1935, Milton C. Nahm published a facsimile edition of the Worcester College manuscript prompt-book of The Cheats , determining by a comparison of the handwriting with the signature of John Wilson in a manuscript at the Bodleian that the Worcester College manuscript was not in his hand. 2 However, the Folger manuscript prompt-book of another play by Wilson, Belphegor; or The Marriage of the Devil , which was purchased by Henry Clay Folger from Pickering &amp; Chatto in 1919, is even more significant bibliographically than that of The Cheats , for it contains, along with the copyist hand and prompt notes in three other hands, corrections as well as a prologue and epilogue in Wilson's own hand. 3 The corrections in the manuscript consist of deletions and additions of entire lines, phrases, single words and letters, and punctuation marks. Henceforth, when I refer to the correcting hand in the Belphegor MS. I include all the above plus the prologue and epilogue. Although other scholars have accepted the correcting hand in the manuscript as Wilson's, no one has ever been able to offer any substantial evidence to support his conjecture. 4 My recent discovery of Wilson's autograph letters at the National Library of Ireland provides evidence which proves that Wilson did indeed correct the Belphegor MS. prompt-book in his own hand. 5 John Wilson wrote his letters when he was serving as the Recorder of Londonderry between the years 1666 and 1680, and they were addressed to the first Duke of Ormonde (dated 30 June 1668, 30 September 1679, and 17 January 1678/79) and to the Most Reverend Michael, Lord Primate and Chancellor of all Ireland (dated 21 June 1679). 6 The letters were included in the immense collection of manuscripts accumulated by the first Duke of Ormonde at Kilkenny Castle, and were initially printed in 1895 by the Historical Manuscripts Commission. 7 The first contemporary reference to these manuscripts was made by the noted historian, Thomas Carte (1686-1754), who about the year 1728 undertook to write a biography of James, Duke of Ormonde. In an interesting preface to this biography Carte explains how he divided the Ormonde collection and which documents eventually remained at Kilkenny Castle: I found in the Evidence-Room at Kilkenny about fourteen wicker binns (each large enough to hold an hogshead of wine in bottles) covered with unweildy books of Stewards accompts; but which upon examination appeared to be full of papers, and to contain a series of papers of state, orders, resolutions and letters of the Privy Council of Ireland , the dispatches of the King and Secretaries of State in England , his Grace's own letters, and those of other great men who corresponded with him, from before the Restoration of King Charles II. to the year 1686. There being no bookbinder at Kilkenny , I was forced to transport these on three Irish carrs to Dublin , where I was continually employed for several months in digesting them, in order to have them bound up like the others. Such papers as upon perusal did not appear useful to my subject, I sent back to Kilkenny . 8 Shortly before his death, Carte deposited his collection of the Ormonde papers in the Bodleian Library; Wilson's autograph letters were among the documents rejected by him and returned to Kilkenny Castle. Under the supervision of Sir John Gilbert the documents were eventually bound into a series of over two hundred large volumes, which were shelved in the Evidence Room at Kilkenny Castle as late as 1920, when the final volume of the Ormonde manuscripts preserved at Kilkenny Castle was published by the Historical Manuscripts Commission. 9 In 1951, the manuscripts were purchased from the Marquess of Ormonde by the National Library of Ireland. According to the director, Alf MacLochlainn, in a letter of 20 June 1977, the manuscripts were deposited in that library some years prior to their actual purchase; they are at present numbered MSS. 2301-2563 and Deeds 1-5383. Since we now have an ample number of specimens of Wilson's handwriting by which to demonstrate that Wilson did correct the Belphegor MS. in his own hand, our conclusions will be based on reliable paleographical evidence. The copyist hand in the Belphegor MS. is an example of a professional italic hand (See Plate I). Wilson's own extremely legible hand was written with a wider nib quill pen than that used by the copyist (See Plates I, II, III). An examination of three minuscules and five capitals will reveal Wilson's characteristic paleography. Two forms of minuscule 'd' are found throughout Wilson's letters and the corrections in the Belphegor MS. Examples of these letter shapes, which occur initially, medially, and terminally, are found in Plate I in 'antidate' in l.5, 'And' and 'done' in l.6, 'and' in l.7, 'deceiv'd' in l.8, 'kindnes' and 'amends' in 1.9. As we can observe, these two forms are used indiscriminately here as they are in Plate II in 'acted' in l.3, 'Bold' in l.4, 'adventrous' in l.5, 'skudd' and 'Wind' in l.6, 'and' in l.7; in Plate III in 'duty' in l.3, 'hard' in l.4, 'pardon' in l.5, and 'pleas'd' in l.6. The italic hand did not have specific minuscule 's' forms designated to be used either initially, medially, or terminally. Wilson uses three forms of minuscule, 's,' as in 'first' and 'has' in Plate I, l.6 and 'sha'nt' in l.7, 'Occasion' in Plate II, l.2, 'adventrous' in l.5, and 'hitts' in l.6, 'please' in Plate III, l.1, 'present' in 1.3, and 'Counsel' in l.7. These three 's' forms can be seen throughout the Belphegor MS. corrections and the autograph letters. Wilson's characteristic form of minuscule 'w' adds a hook at the first penstroke of the letter, as in 'what' in Plate I, l.5, 'was' in Plate II, l.4, and 'w ch ' in Plate III, l.9. The same hooked form is used in the capital 'W' in 'What'er' in Plate I, l.8, in 'What' in Plate II, l.14, and 'Wherein' in Plate III, l.14. Evident in all the pages reproduced here are Wilson's typically crossed capitals 'I' and 'J'. This italic crossed 'I' is found in Plate I, l.6, Plate II, l.22, and Plate III, l.2; the crossed 'J' can be seen in 'Joane' in Plate II, l.21 and in Wilson's signature in Plate III, l.32. His italic capital 'G' is seen in 'Grasse-girle' in Plate II, l.21, and throughout the reproduction in Plate III. His unlinked capital 'L' is found in 'Like' in Plate I, l.7, 'Lesse' in Plate II, l.5, and 'London' in Plate III, l.12. This 'L' is used extensively in the Belphegor MS. corrections and in the autograph letters. Wilson was fond of old-fashioned contractions, such as 'yo r ' in Plate I, l.5, Plate II, l.12, and Plate III, ll.1,3,5,6. This contraction is found throughout all the manuscripts being examined here. Orthographic similarities represented in the reproductions include the doubling of consonants, as in 'putt' and 'hitts' in Plate II, ll.4,6 and 'Lett' in Plate III, l.26. Wilson also favors the addition of terminal 'e', as in 'Soe' in Plate II, l.12 and Plate III, l.4. All the paleographical evidence in this demonstration supports the conclusion that the corrections in the Folger Belphegor MS. prompt-book and the autograph letters of John Wilson were written by the same hand. Wilson most likely obtained the prompt-copy of his play, which was produced at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin during the 1677-78 or 1682-83 seasons, and corrected it sometime before the London production at Dorset Garden in 1690. 10 The Folger manuscript, however, is probably not the copy submitted to the printer for the London edition of 1691 (Wing 2915). Although a majority of the revisions were incorporated in virtually the same form in the 1691 quarto edition, it is worth observing that none of the extensive prompt notes were also printed. More than likely, Wilson had a clean copy prepared from the Folger Belphegor MS., which he then submitted to the London playhouse and eventually to the printer.</field>

Massey, Managing Director of Pickering &amp; Chatto Ltd., stated that many of their early files had been destroyed, but if any information regarding Wilson's Belphegor is still extant, it will be forwarded to me. In The Playhouse of Pepys (1935), p. 226, the Reverend Montague Summers refers to a description of the Belphegor MS. "in a catalogue of Messr. Pickering and Chatto about 1910." 4 As early as 1935, the Reverend Montague Summers referred to a manuscript of John Wilson's Belphegor as "The author's original MS.," but he provided no evidence for this statement ( The Playhouse of Pepys , 1935), p. 226. R. C. Bald, writing in "Shakespeare on the Stage in Restoration Dublin" ( PMLA , 56 [1941], 372), not only recognized the copyist and three prompt hands in the manuscript, but also offered the hypothesis that "This manuscript . . . contains corrections in the text as well as a prologue and epilogue in what is apparently the hand of the author." Bald was also the first to connect the copyist hand with that of The Merry Wives fragment in the Smock Alley prompt-book once in the possession of Halliwell-Phillipps and now preserved at the Folger. William S. Clark asserted in The Early Irish Stage (1955), p. 82, that the Folger Belphegor MS. prompt-book has "textual corrections in the hand of the author." 5 I wish to thank Laetitia Yeandle, Curator of Rare Books and Manuscripts at the Folger, for her assistance in locating Wilson's autograph letters. 6 Extracts from MS. 2505—Letters of John Wilson, National Library of Ireland, Dublin.

All scholars who have cited Wilson's letters have used as their source the printed volumes of the HMC. For example, Milton C. Nahm cites the Historical Manuscripts Commission, 1st Series, vol. 1 when he refers to Wilson's letters (p. 21). A collation of the printed version of these letters with the manuscript copies reveals substantial errors in transcription. The HMC editor expanded all abbreviations and contractions, and modernized some of the punctuation and orthography so that the idiosyncracies of Wilson's writing style are significantly transformed. For example, the original spellings "beleive" and "breifly" are changed in the printed version to "believe" and "briefly"; also, the modernized punctuation distorts Wilson's original pattern of a semi-colon followed by a word beginning with a capital letter. Occasionally, even an entire word is changed or omitted. 8 An History of the Life of James Duke of Ormonde, From His Birth in 1610, to his Death in 1688 , 3 vols.

      <field name="heading_text">The Mystery of Farquhar's Stage-Coach Reconsidered by Shirley Strum Kenny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Farquhar's only farce, The Stage-Coach , generally recognized as singularly important in the early development of the afterpiece, has commonly been dated as first performed shortly before 2 February 1704 at Lincoln's Inn Fields, attributed to a collaboration between Farquhar and Peter Anthony Motteux, and reprinted, when at all, from the London 1705 edition. In 1932 W. J. Lawrence proposed a different chronology and theatrical history for the play: according to Lawrence, The Stage-Coach was first acted considerably earlier, before March 1702, and quite possibly appeared as an afterpiece to Farquhar's Sir Harry Wildair at Drury Lane in April 1701. The prologue and epilogue by Samuel Philips or Phillips, which Lawrence found printed in the 1775 edition of the Works edited by "Thomas Wilkes," he attributed to "some later benefit performance" of the ballad opera made from the farce and first performed in Dublin and London in 1730. 1 In his Bibliography of the Restoration Drama (1934), Montague Summers listed The Stage-Coach as opening at Drury Lane in 1701 (p. 20); The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (II, 753) set the opening at Lincoln's Inn Fields, circa the same year. For the most part, however, more recent theatrical historians, unconvinced, have continued to date the premiere shortly before 2 February 1704. 2 No one has tried to unravel the complex textual problems presented by three distinct and unrelated texts found in the Dublin edition of 1704, the London one of 1705, and the text printed in the Dramatick Works of 1736. Indeed, no one has ever acknowledged that the textual problems beyond the first two editions exist. Charles A. Stonehill, in his edition of The Works of George Farquhar (1930, repr. 1967) printed the London 1705 text; he listed variants from the Dublin edition, but never considered the possibility of its authenticity. The intricacy of the problems of dating, authorship, textual authority, and the Phillips pieces, added to the absence of some seemingly essential bits of evidence, might well discourage inquiry. Nevertheless, solutions to at least some of the mysteries of The Stage-Coach indeed exist, shrouded in the cobwebs of theatrical and bibliographical history. In this paper I will show that (1) the play opened at Lincoln's Inn Fields sometime between fall 1700 and late February 1702; (2) the Dublin 1704 edition is most likely Farquhar's text, the London 1705 edition is not his, and the London 1735 edition is most probably taken from the Drury Lane promptbook; (3) Motteux was Farquhar's collaborator, but his contribution beyond the "Stage-Coach Song" and perhaps the translation of the French source is uncertain; (4) the Phillips prologue and epilogue date from a revival in the 1704-1705 season, perhaps on 16 October 1704.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Date Recent scholars have agreed that The Stage-Coach opened shortly before 2 February 1704, the date of the earliest extant advertisement. The Daily Courant on that day advertised it as "the last new Farce"; although this wording would not suggest a premiere, Leo Hughes points out it would indicate "pretty clearly that the performance was recent " (p. 82, n. 20). So one would ordinarily believe. But in this instance, other details give pause. First of all, even the advertisement cautions one against accepting the formulaic phrasing as proof of a recent premiere: "At the New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Wed. Feb. 2—The Country Wit with an Addition of the last new Farce, call'd The Stage Coach. And several Entertainments of Danceing." John Crowne's Country Wit was an old chestnut, first performed in 1675; Lincoln's Inn Fields had tried it in September 1703 for the first time in five years, adding at that time "the last new Epilogue. . ." as well as a dialogue between Heraclitus Ridens and the Observator by way of Prologue. Obviously both performances, in a year of virulent struggle between the two companies, were revivals of an old favorite, embellished with anything that could easily be attached. The fact that The Stage-Coach was not deemed enough to guarantee an audience, that "several Entertainments of Danceing" were also required, would suggest that the farce was not new. And indeed it was not. Clearly it predates Mary Pix's The Different Widows (premiere date unknown, but probably November 1703; published 4 December 1703). The prologue to that piece laments the lack of current taste for tragedy—even Monimia, the heroine of Otway's The Orphan , has not found an audience. Military men feel they've had enough tragedy in Flanders; at home they want laughter: Damn Tragedys says one, I hate the strain,} I got a Surfeit of 'em last Campaign ; } Come, prithee let's be gon to Drury-Lane . } Thither in Crouds ye flock'd to see, Sir Harry ,} Or any Fop dress'd All-A-Mode de Paris ; } So 'twas but Droll , it never could Miscarry. } Finding your Palates so much out of tast, We fairly ventur'd for a lucky Cast: And Wit being grown by Prohibition scarce, Regal'd you here too with an Irish Farce . Twas Farce , and therefore pleas'd You; for a while, Our Teague , and Nicodemus made you smile: That Lure grown stale, we since are forc'd to fill, With Supplemental Epilogue , our Bill : For having us'd you still to something new, You now begin t' expect it as your due. . . . 3 The prologue incontrovertibly refers to The Stage-Coach , for Nicodemus can be no one but Squire Nicodemus Somebody, the country booby who was the favorite character of the farce, the role consistently advertised in playbills. "Our Teague," that is, our stage Irishman, probably is Macahone of the same farce since the author seems to speak of a single farce, but it may have referred also to the original Teague in Sir Robert Howard's The Committee . 4 "An Irish farce" links the play to Farquhar in a way his contemporaries would immediately have understood; indeed the most notably Irish element of the play is its author, for Macahone has a relatively small role. The Stage-Coach , then, played at Lincoln's Inn Fields long enough before The Different Widows opened late in 1703 that its lure had "grown stale" and had to be supplemented by epilogues or other cordials, a situation that calls to mind the bill for 2 February 1704. The prologue demonstrates as accurately as any in the period the desperate competition of the theaters, the increasing sense of siege and strife, and the resultant frantic attempt to win audiences by embellishing the program with dancing, singing, farces, new prologues and epilogues, any gimmick to attract an audience. More important, it demonstrates the Lincoln's Inn Fields company's continuing frustration over George Farquhar's unprecedented success with The Constant Couple at Drury Lane, which broke all performance records in 1699-1700 and held the record until The Beggar's Opera set a new one in 1728—the reference to Sir Harry Wildair would have required no explanation. The term "Irish farce" became a code word for Farquhar's play, "farce" derogating his comedy, and "Irish" its author. His literary reputation suffered the ire aroused by his success, for jealous playwrights and critics (many of whom were failed playwrights) felt his success unjustified and even insulting to their own stage efforts. With considerable relish, they condemned Farquhar as a new MacFlecknoe, an Irish fool, a writer of farce. The prologuist cannot quite admit to admiration or even mere approval for the piece of Irish farce which tempted audiences to attend Lincoln's Inn Fields. When one's own efforts faced such struggles, one must have relished animosity toward a twenty-five-year-old Irishman who breezily conquered the playhouse. Willard Connely and Eric Rothstein both cite Pix's prologue as evidence that The Stage-Coach opened in the fall of 1703, 5 but the trail winds further back. Given the conclusive evidence of Pix's reference to Nicodemus, one realizes that in the spate of prologues in 1703 against Irish farce, lines which seem venomous attacks on The Constant Couple several years after its first run also embrace The Stage-Coach , denigrating the former by categorizing it with the latter. One such prologue preceded John Oldmixon's The Governour of Cyprus , which opened at Lincoln's Inn Fields probably in December 1702 or early January 1703 and was published 13 January 1703: Since Farce and Fustian cou'd so often please ye The Task, we fancy'd, wou'd for us be easy. We thought we might, as well as others, Hit; For ev'ry thing of late succeeds but Wit. A few Loose Characters, a Lucky Name Brings a full House, and gets the Poet Fame. And he that has the art to fill the Pit, With us shall ever be the topping Wit: The passage seems, at first glance, general—"Farce and Fustian"—but in the context of the day-to-day events of the theaters, it is specifically a reference to the Lincoln's Inn Fields production of The Stage-Coach . The lines become comprehensible only if one understands that Lincoln's Inn Fields ("we") as well as Drury Lane ("others") could fill the house by importing "a few Loose Characters" (Nicodemus, Macahone, Dolly, etc.) and a "Lucky Name" (Farquhar). The final quoted couplet, like the rest of the passage, shows the contempt, even hatred, that Oldmixon consistently expressed for his successful fellow playwright Farquhar. 6 But Lincoln's Inn Fields had attracted the best-drawing playwright of Drury Lane, and that feat was worthy of note; Oldmixon had grudgingly to admit the success of the ploy, if not the play. The Stage-Coach buoyed Lincoln's Inn Fields at a time when the theater could barely stay afloat. Three points should be noted: (1) Oldmixon, like the author of the prologue for The Different Widows , seems to have considered the famous Farquhar, not Motteux, author of the farce; (2) the date of the first performance must be pushed back at least another year; (3) the play must have been performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields, as the title-pages of the first two editions state, not at Drury Lane as Lawrence and Summers surmised. In fact, the date must, I believe, be set at least another year earlier, sometime before late February 1702. The final evidence appears in Farquhar's own works, the prologue and preface to The Inconstant , a letter in Love and Business , and internal evidence in The Stage-Coach . The Inconstant probably opened in February 1702; it was published 5 March 1702. The printed prologue, 7 written by Motteux, who assisted in The Stage-Coach , compares the theatrical bill to a bill of fare, a not uncommon metaphor in the period: Like hungry Guests a sitting Audience looks: Plays are like Suppers: Poets are the Cooks. . . . Each Act, a Course; Each Scene, a different Dish. . . . Your surly Scenes, where Rant and Bloodshed joyn, Are Butcher's Meat, a Battel's a Sirloyn. Your Scenes of Love, so flowing, soft, and chaste, Are Water-gruel, without Salt or Taste. Baudy's fat Ven'son, which, tho stale, can please: . . . . Your Rarity for the fair Guests to gape on Is your nice Squeaker , or Italian Capon; . . . . An Op'ra, like an Olio, nicks the Age; Farce is the Hasty-Pudding of the Stage. For when you're treated with indifferent Cheer, Ye can dispense with slender Stage-Coach Fare. . . . But Comedy, That, That's the darling Cheer. } This Night we hope you'll an Inconstant bear: } Wild Fowl is lik'd in Playhouse all the year. . . .} In the context of the prologue, the "Stage-Coach Fare" must refer to performances of the farce. The poem abounds in specific references to theatrical events, blended into the central metaphor of the feast, often with the help of puns. The Wild Fowl, for example, refers to Mirabel in Fletcher's The Wild Goose , adapted by Farquhar in the current production, The Inconstant . The Squeaker or Italian Capon was Signior Clementine, the famous eunuch, servant to the Elector of Bavaria, who was hired by Drury Lane in spring of 1699 at a reported salary of £500 a year. "Stage-Coach Fare" is another play on words; it can only indicate the farce. It is "slender" in two ways—both slight in size and slight in value, but when no better theatrical nourishment is available, the audience can "dispense with" it, that is, put up with it and make do. The Inconstant of course opened at Drury Lane; there must have been something of the delight of an "in-joke" in the slightly denigrating reference made by Motteux to the other house's farce, in which he had a hand. Farquhar includes in the preface to the play an enigmatic reference to Lincoln's Inn Fields ignored by Stonehill in the explanatory notes to his edition. The passage reads: The New House has perfectly made me a Convert by their civility on my sixth night; for, to be Friends, and reveng'd at the same time, I must give them a Play, that is—when I write another; for faction runs so high, that I cou'd wish the Senate wou'd suppress the Houses, or put in force the Act against bribing Elections, that House which has the most favours to bestow will certainly carry it, spight of all Poetical Justice that wou'd support t'other. What does it mean? The sixth night must refer to the author's second benefit for The Inconstant , which ran six days consecutively, according to the preface. But how was Lincoln's Inn Fields civil on that occasion? Did the company, perhaps, run The Stage-Coach against Drury Lane's Inconstant ? The passage seems to suggest that Farquhar gave the play to the new house to be presented anonymously, that in the preface he spoke of it jestingly and enigmatically, perhaps playing upon speculations about the authorship, as Motteux did in the prologue added for publication. Surely Farquhar laments the acidity of the theatrical warfare between the two houses—he seems also to regret the need to offer his farce anonymously. Still one cannot incontrovertibly prove the meaning of the intentionally puzzling passage, "for, to be Friends, and reveng'd at the same time, I must give them a Play, that is—when I write another." Does he, in fact, refer to a play already given to the new house? The possibility is certainly strong. Farquhar also refers to The Stage-Coach in a letter published in his miscellany Love and Business , published 28 February 1702. 8 In a letter to the mysterious woman addressed in the collection, he writes on "Tuesday Morning, one Stocking on, and t'other off," lamenting the pangs of authorship in a punning, metaphorical manner: But now Madam, hear my misfortune The Angry Fates and dire Stage-Coach Upon my Liberty incroach, To bear me hence with many a Jog From thee my charming dear Incog. Unhappy Wretch! at once who feels O'returns of Hack, and Fortune's Wheels . This is my Epitaph, Madam, for now I'm a dead Man, and the Stage-Coach may most properly be call'd my Herse, bearing the Corps only of deceas'd F------r ; for his Soul is left with you, whom he loves above all Womankind; . . . . The Stage-Coach which encroached upon his liberty was, of course, the farce he struggled to adapt. The jolting and jogging of the stagecoach is cursed in the farce and celebrated in Motteux's comical song, which is full of "Jogging," "Jolting," tumbling and jumbling until "up Tails all." The "Hack," a pun on the coach for hire, also refers of course to hireling writers, like Motteux, like Jean de la Chapelle, whose farce Les Carrosses d'Orléans was adapted, and perhaps like Farquhar seemed to himself in his labors to anglicize the farce. The effort of the adaptation was "killing" him— The Stage-Coach would finish him, hence would serve as his hearse—with puns of this witty, jocular sort, Farquhar filled the correspondence. The dating of the correspondence reinforces other evidence about the date of the farce. Love and Business was published by Bernard Lintot on 28 February 1702, that is, within days or weeks of the premiere of The Inconstant ; but in Lintot's memorandum book of "Copies when published," he entered a payment of £3/4/6 for Farquhar's "Letters and Poems," i.e. Love and Business , on 3 July 1701. 9 The only fully dated letters in the collection came from Holland in August and October 1700. The only dated love letter, one later in the collection than the reference to The Stage-Coach , is marked simply "Hague, October the 23d. New Stile," that is, 23 October 1700, when he was in Holland. The sequence of love letters must have been written over a period of time, probably in 1700. There is some speculation that the "Penelope" of the collection is Anne Oldfield, whom Farquhar had "discovered" in 1699 (Connely, pp. 86-87), another reason to believe 1700 a likely date. He requested the return of the correspondence because he had "promis'd to equip a Friend with a few Letters to help out a Collection for the Press" 10 probably before 3 July 1701 when Lintot paid him. Therefore, it seems likely that the letters were written in 1700 and that the farce, which encroached on his liberty, was written during the same period. The text of the play offers one final clue to dating. The Dublin edition of 1704 contains the line "Come out here, I Charge you in the Kings Name?" As I shall show, Farquhar was probably the source of copy-text for this edition. In the 1705 London edition, the line reads, "Come out here. I charge you to come out, I am an Officer, What—won't you come out, in the Queens name. . . ." King William died 8 March 1702; the Dublin manuscript obviously predated his death. The most likely conclusion, then, is that The Stage-Coach first played at Lincoln's Inn Fields either in the 1700-1701 season or by February of the 1701-1702 season; a multitude of data indicate it could not have opened later. Who, then, first performed the piece, and why was it not published soon after it opened as most plays were? We have no incontrovertible answers— speculation becomes a temptation. Clearly the cast listed in the 1705 London edition was not the original cast, for they could only have been assembled in the season of 1703-1704. 11 The Dublin edition does not even list a cast. The scantiest theatrical information for any season in the eighteenth century obscures the season of 1701-1702 (Avery I, 15), and 1700-1701 is little better, so lack of information about the opening is not surprising. What is surprising is the seeming anonymity of the play that was probably the first farce used as an afterpiece, an anonymity even more astonishing when one considers the popularity of its author. Would Broadway mount a Neil Simon piece anonymously?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Texts The unusual publication history of The Stage-Coach presents as many "mysteries" as its dating. The first quarto (Q1) was published in Dublin in 1704 with the imprint "Printed, and are to be Sold by the Booksellers," an imprint often used for unauthorized editions. The second quarto (Q2) was published in London by Benjamin Bragg on 3 or 4 May 1705. 12 Both stated the play was first acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Two editions appeared with the imprint "London, Printed in the Year 1709" (1709a, copy at the Folger Shakespeare Library, shelfmarked PR2823 1710b Sh. Col.; 1709b, copy at Harvard, shelfmarked EC75. Sh668. 750eb), in the year of a successful revival at Drury Lane, the theater noted on both title-pages. From 1709 Drury Lane was the theater noted on title-pages in London editions. Of these four early editions, only Q1 lists Farquhar as the author. Curll published the farce in 1718 (1718) with the Phillips prologue and epilogue. Two Dublin editions appeared in 1719 (Du 1719) and 1728 (Du 1728), S. Powell for George Risk. In 1735 the farce was twice published in nearly identical printings for W. Feales (1735a, 1735b); at least one of these, perhaps copies of both, were included in the Dramatick Works of 1736. Unquestionably 1735b (copy in the British Library, shelfmarked 1507/424) was a second printing with 1735a as copy text. 13 Four more London editions were published within the century, in 1766, Lowndes (1766); 1772, Lowndes (1772), included in the tenth edition of the Works ; 1775, Oxlade (1775); and 1778, Wenman (1778). In Dublin it appeared in the "operatic" version, that is, with songs, issued by Wilson, Exshaw, and Bradley in 1761 (Du 1761), included in the "eighth" Dublin edition of the Works ; and by Ewing in 1775 (Du 1775). The most surprising single fact about the publication is that three distinct manuscripts underlay the printed editions, one used as printer's copy for Q1, one for Q2, and one for 1735a. None of these three texts derives from either of the others. Although Stonehill, the only modern editor to reprint the farce, collated only Q1 and Q2 and used Q2 as copy text without even discussing the reasons for his choice, each of these three editions must be studied to decide which should be considered authoritative or if, perhaps, all have some separate kind of authority. All other editions of intervening and later years were derived from these three important texts; none of the other editions is textually significant. The relationship of the three underlying manuscripts to each other and to Farquhar and Motteux can be determined through a combination of biographical and bibliographical evidence. The biographical evidence indicates that Farquhar was in Dublin when Q1 appeared there as well as when Q2 was issued in London. Traditionally biographers have assumed that Farquhar took the manuscript of The Stage-Coach to his brother, a Dublin bookseller, on a visit in 1704 (Lawrence, p. 394; Connely, pp. 226-228). The story originates with Wilkes's biography in the Dublin Works of 1775: In this year [1704], our author came to Dublin to see his friends, and lodged at his brother's, who kept a bookseller's shop, in Castle-street; he proposed publishing his works by subscription; but not meeting with encouragement according to his expectations, he was advised to have a Benefit Play, and to perform a character in it; but being in the army, was obliged to obtain the leave of the Lord Lieutenant. . . . (I, ix-x). In his recent study of "George Farquhar's Military Career," Robert John Jordan shows that Farquhar was indeed in Dublin, not "to see his friends" but on military duty, some time after 20 October 1704 when his regiment began arriving in Ireland and certainly after 23 March 1705 by which time the last seven companies of the regiment had come to Dublin. 14 Jordan estimates that the benefit performance of The Constant Couple , attended by the Duke of Ormonde, occurred between 15 November and 25 March; this period would have been the only time in 1704 in which the benefit could have taken place. It seems likely that Q1 was published during the same period late in 1704, that is, only a few months before Q2 was published in London on 3 or 4 May 1705. Farquhar's established presence in Dublin in 1704 and 1705, the fact that his brother was a bookseller in Dublin at the time, and his anonymity as author in the London edition render strikingly credible the possibility that he may have been the source of the Dublin edition rather than the London one; the usual skepticism about Dublin editions, particularly those issued "by the Booksellers" rather than under a specific imprint, seems inappropriate in this instance. The biographical evidence which argues for authenticity of the Dublin manuscript also argues against Farquhar's involvement in the London publication, for he must have continued in Dublin at least until the end of July 1705. Although as Jordan points out "absenteeism among officers was a notorious feature of Queen Anne's army," there is no reason to believe Farquhar returned to London before 3-4 May, when Q2 appeared. His regiment stayed in Ireland throughout 1705 and took part in the annual encampment in late June and early July, the camp being a duty which officers did not risk missing. After that, Farquhar sat in judgment on a trooper on 27 July 1705 in Dublin Castle (Jordan, pp. 259-260). Since there is no evidence of his having come to London between the two verifiable stints in Dublin, one must conclude he was away during the time Q2 was in press. Furthermore, Farquhar was by this time consistently publishing with Lintot, probably the biggest dramatext entrepreneur of his day in London. Love and Business (28 February 1702), The Inconstant (Knapton, Strahan, and Lintot, 12 March 1702), The Twin Rivals (29 December 1702), The Recruiting Officer (25 April 1706), and The Beaux Stratagem (27 March 1707) were all issued under Lintot's imprint; Farquhar contracted with no other bookseller to publish plays during these years. 15 Again biography suggests skepticism about any connection between Farquhar and Q2. The edition itself is sufficiently odd to cast doubts on its authenticity. First of all, although Q1 attributed the farce to Farquhar on the title-page, there is no byline in Q2, and yet Farquhar's name would certainly have drawn business. The edition appeared without any link to recent performances; the most recent one noted in The London Stage had occurred on 16 October 1704. It lists a cast that could only have appeared during the ten performances 16 in 1703-1704, that is, the previous season, because the actors were not all in the company in 1704-1705 or indeed in any other season. The piece is labelled a "Comedy" rather than a "Farce." It is elaborately divided into three acts. The sixteen pages of text in Q1 swell to thirty-nine pages in Q2, with large type and huge margins inflating the small four-penny farce into an acceptably long shilling comedy. 17 Farquhar was in Dublin serving his Queen. The outdated cast list, neither the first nor the most recent performers of the farce, suggests the lack of a playhouse source for the manuscript. One is led, then, to suspect either coauthor Motteux or an interloper as the person who brought the manuscript, distinctly different from that followed in Q1, to Bragg for publication. Although the possibility of an unknown purveyor cannot be rejected entirely, circumstantial evidence, if not enough to convict Motteux, certainly makes that "thrifty Cit" (Prologue, The Different Widows ), a likely suspect. Three months earlier, in the Diverting Post for 20-27 January 1705, Bragg printed the "Mountebank Song" from Motteux's play Farewel Folly; or, the Younger the Wiser . On 6 February, he published The Amorous Miser: or, the Younger the Wiser anonymously. The play is considered an early draft or piracy of Farewel Folly , which played at Drury Lane 18 January 1705 but did not appear in print until 1707. 18 The similarity of circumstances, the song plus two "anonymous" plays, all connected with Motteux, printed within about three months for Bragg, leads one to strong suspicions that Motteux had a hand in bringing them into print. Another reason to suspect the Frenchman is that although the two editions vary in ways that preclude any form of derivation from the same manuscript, some of the variants are either foolish compositorial misreadings of the manuscript or bad stabs at English colloquialisms. Although I have no information on the state of Motteux's familiarity with colloquialisms and perhaps give him less than his due, some Q2 expressions have a foreign flavor. For example, the phrase "Club this Matter" in Q1, meaning divide the bill of expenses, becomes "Curry this Club" in Q2, a reading that makes no sense. "But this is a rare time to quit Scores with him," that is, get even with him, in Q1 becomes in Q2 "but this is a rare time to kill Horses with him," an inexplicable line in the context. Such errors could derive from a misreading of a manuscript—"quit Scores" might well look like "kill Horses" in some hands. They could not, of course, derive from a printed version. The dedication and epilogue further argue against Farquhar's hand in the publication, but they argue neither for nor against Motteux as Bragg's source. No prologue, epilogue, or dedication appears in Q1; all three items appear in Q2. The prologue borrows in part from Farquhar's epilogue to John Oldmixon's The Grove (1700), a plagiarism of which Farquhar as well as Motteux would have been capable. Farquhar did on occasion borrow from himself, although most of the borrowings are less conspicuous than this. Since he was not, I believe, given to plagiarizing other writers' works, someone else was probably responsible for borrowing the epilogue, almost verbatim, from the prologue to Thomas Goffe's The Careless Shepherdess , published in 1656. The lines of the epilogue at first reading seem deliciously rich in clues: When first this Farce was acted, 'twas unknown To th'Author, and before 'twas Feathered, flown; He now consents, that you shou'd see't once more, . . . He knows there is a snarling Sect i'th'Town, That do condemn all Wit, except their own; Were this Farce ne're so good, it shou'd not take, . . . . But the clues melt when one learns that the epilogue was a plagiarism and that these lines refer to a theatrical incident more than forty-five years earlier. Accidentals of the epilogue mirror the prologue in the 1656 edition of Goffe's play so closely that it is evident someone carefully copied the earlier text when the material was "stolen bodily," as Lawrence says (p. 392). Considering the frequency with which both Farquhar and Motteux scribbled prologues and epilogues for their own plays and others', one would expect neither to resort to plagiarism in this case. The unsigned dedication to Samuel Bagshaw in Q2 is completely uncharacteristic of Farquhar, who never inclines toward the fulsome. Robert Newton Cunningham, however, finds it lacks "the extravagant flattery" characteristic of Motteux (p. 143). Lawrence points out that Farquhar signs his dedications and suggests it might be a publisher's dedication (pp. 394-395). Motteux also signs his, but no one signed this one. Statements in the Epistle Dedicatory are meaningless in terms of Farquhar: . . . yet I can Glory, I resemble him [Ben Jonson] in this, that I am assaulted with the Ignorance of partial and prejudicial Readers; as has sufficiently appeared by a piece I lately Publish't, which because it looked upon all with an Impartial Eye, and (remote from servile Flattery) spared not nearest Relations, taxing not their Persons but their Vices, is hated for speaking Truth, but those gall'd Camels whom it toucht to the quick, their Anger I as much scorn as pity. Stonehill (II, 431) believes the passage fits The Twin Rivals , but it does not, for the author obviously refers to a specific attack not a play. And although Farquhar was indeed constantly "assaulted with the Ignorance of partial and prejudicial Readers" and critics, he was never one to complain about it. Furthermore, no one, myself included, has ever found evidence of the existence of a Samuel Bagshaw; he was surely no figure of importance. Finally, the dedication never reappears in any edition. The internal evidence then, like the biographical evidence, suggests that either Motteux provided Bragg with the manuscripts for The Stage-Coach and The Amorous Miser or Bragg managed to acquire them in some underhanded way. In any event, a manuscript, probably a rather messy one, was printer's copy, and Farquhar was not its source. Of the two reprints in London in 1709, the first, 1709a, is a reprint of Q2, but the title-page says "As it was Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury Lane," and the cast list matches that of the playbill for 17 May 1709, the first recorded performance at Drury Lane. The second, 1709b, is a reprint of 1709a. Curll's London 1718 edition lists the same cast and theater, but it is a reprint of Q1, as are the Dublin editions of 1719 and 1728. It is, then, a surprise to discover in 1735a a third distinct text, the copy for which was neither Q1 nor Q2. This edition and 1735b, which derives from it and introduces a few variants, list no actors although the title-page notes "As it is Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane." They contain "Some Memoirs of Mr. George Farquhar," which had been published in the sixth edition of the works in 1728; however, no London edition of the Works or the Comedies before 1735 had included The Stage-Coach . One would expect in 1735a a reprint of an earlier edition of the farce, but such is not the case; 1735a agrees with Q1 in some readings, Q2 in others; but in still other variants it agrees with neither. For instance, a stage direction in Q1 reads " Peeps in the Empty Purse and throws it down ." Q2 substitutes " the Pot ," for " the Empty Purse and "; 1735a reads " the empty Pot, and ". Again, Q1 reads "see what your Uncle will say to you"; Q2, "odd you'll make a rare Wife, if you"; and 1735a "See what your Uncle will say to you! You'll make a rare Wife, faith, if you. . . ." Q1 reads "Whimbled", Q2 "dwindled", 1735a, probably accurately, "whindled". Q1 reads "I Charge you in the Kings Name?", Q2 "I charge you to come out, I am an Officer, What—won't you come out, in the Queens name,"; and 1735a "I charge ye come out: I'm an Officer, won't you come out in the King's Name?" The list could be extended at great length. The notion of authorial or editorial revisions so long after Farquhar and Motteux died lacks credibility. Another manuscript was printer's copy. The most logical explanation is a playhouse copy, that of Drury Lane. The farce had played there fifty-five times by 1735, and it had first played there with some of the original cast. Between 1704 and 1735 it played only eight times at Lincoln's Inn Fields, according to available records, and the last of those performances was in 1720. There is, of course, no absolute proof that the playhouse copy was the source for 1735a, but no other explanation makes any sense. Furthermore, the copy must have been a manuscript used at Drury Lane, for it was neither Q1 nor Q2. The possibility of a playhouse copy seems extremely probable also because editions of plays in the early 1730's under Feales's imprint seem to have had a close relationship to the theater. Others of Farquhar's plays were revised for the Dramatick Works of 1736 or other editions of the same period (1728-1735) according to the promptbook—the best example, perhaps, is the exclusion of a scene in The Beaux Stratagem , probably cut during or immediately after the first season. Professor Leo Hughes has told me that he has found Feales's editions of this period anticipating Bell's later editions. It is extremely likely, then, that 1735a reflects what played at Drury Lane, probably from the earliest performances there in 1709 (although the text reads "King's Name" again, not "Queens name"). The text must be considered of far more importance than one would usually give a text published twenty-eight years after the author's death. Farquhar had died in 1707, but his relationship with Drury Lane and particularly with actor Robert Wilks was so close that one suspects the manuscript probably came from him or his widow. Why did the farce not appear in the earlier editions of the Comedies and Works ? Doubtless for the simple reason that neither Lintot nor his associates in the collected editions owned the copyright. The first edition of the Comedies appeared 27 March 1708, 19 after Farquhar's death. Lintot made appropriate arrangements for all seven full-length comedies (he owned the rights on four of them). Whether it was possible to buy rights to The Stage-Coach or whether Lintot even knew it was part of the canon we cannot know. Its copyright, however, expired 10 April 1731 according to the Copyright Act of 1710. When the Dramatick Works of 1736 appeared, The Stage-Coach was included for the first time, its copyright now expired. No later editions are textually significant. Curll's edition of 1718 and all the Dublin editions derive from Q1; the two editions of 1709 derive from Q2; and the other London editions (1735b, 1766, 1772, 1775, 1778) from 1735a. The play was called a farce in Q1 and the London editions of 1735, 1766, 1772, and 1775; a comedy in Q2 and 1709a, 1709b, 1718, Du 1719, and Du 1728; and an opera in Du 1761 and Du 1775. Three sets of memoirs appear with the farce: (1) one which begins "Mr. George Farquhar was a Gentleman by Birth. . . ." and does not discuss The Stage-Coach , in 1718, Du 1719, and Du 1728; (2) one which begins "'Tis observ'd that the World. . . ." and says Farquhar assisted Motteux in The Stage-Coach , in 1735 as well as the sixth edition of the Works in 1728 and several subsequent editions of the Works ; (3) one that begins "Mr. Farquhar, an ingenious Writer and Poet, . . ." and says he was "jointly concerned with another" in composition of The Stage-Coach , in 1766 and 1775.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Authorship Scholars have generally believed The Stage-Coach was a collaborative effort between Farquhar and Motteux, although they have usually attributed most of the work to Farquhar. Although three editions of the farce were published without Farquhar's byline (Q2, 1709a, 1709b), Motteux's name never appeared in an edition. The first reference to Motteux as collaborator appeared in a memoir published with the sixth edition of Farquhar's works in London in 1728 and reprinted in the next three editions of the Works (1736, 1742, 1760) and the sixth Dublin edition of the Poems, Letters, and Essays . This memoir claims Farquhar "assisted Mr. Motteux " in the composition. Thomas Whincop says Farquhar wrote "a great Part" of it, Motteux the rest. 20 The Biographia Dramatica says he was assisted in it by Motteux. 21 The first reference to the collaboration, then, occurred more than a quarter of a century after the premiere, twenty-one years after Farquhar died, and ten years after Motteux was murdered. Barring reliable contemporary evidence of collaboration, one must look toward internal evidence and bibliographical clues of a collaborative effort. Some scholars have suggested that Motteux was responsible for the original translation from La Chapelle's Les Carrosses d'Orléans ; Rothstein points out that he was a Frenchman noted for his talents at translation, and he was living in France in 1681 when La Chapelle's farce opened. 22 A translation by Motteux seems a likely possibility although Farquhar probably would not have needed a translator, and he did not follow the original very closely anyway. The finished product owed relatively little to Les Carrosses d'Orléans other than the concept of farce via stage-coach travel plus the usual love triangle. Even the passengers are different, and, from the first, lines are loosely translated, double entendre supplied, etc. Both plot and dialogue are very far from La Chapelle's original; the play is an English farce, not merely a translation. The "Stage-Coach Song" provides stronger grounds for tapping Motteux as a collaborator: the song's short lines, jingling rhythms, and feminine rhymes are entirely consistent with his style in other songs: Let's Sing of Stage-Coaches, And fear no Reproaches, For Riding in one, But daily by Jogging, While Whistling and Flogging, The Coachman drives on: . . . For example, the "Mountebank Song" is similar in form: Here are People and Sports, Of all Sizes, and Sorts, Coach'd Damsel with Squire, And Mob in the Mire; Tarpawlions, Trugmullions, Lords, Ladies, Sows, Babies, And Loobies in Scores; . . . . Farquhar never wrote songs of this sort; "The Trifle" is instead witty and satirical, and he also wrote love songs and a few humorous ones such as drinking songs. But such jogging tunes were a kind of trademark of the indefatigable Frenchman. Other details characteristic of Motteux also suggest he may well have participated. For example, at the bottom of the page of Dramatis Personae is noted "the Time of Action the same with that of Representation." Notations of the duration of a play's action occur in none of Farquhar's other plays, and they are not usual practice. However, they occur in the same place in five of Motteux's plays and operas. 23 Q2 has the flavor of the French scenic structure: nineteen of the twenty-five entrances begin a new page of the text, as the French divide plays into scenes according to entrances, even though the placement makes for oddly sized pages and no continuity in foremat, as a result. For example, page 10, with seven lines of dialogue, is followed by page 11, with twenty-three; page 32, with twenty-four lines of dialogue, is followed by page 33 with fifteen. These mechanical peculiarities, like the biographical facts and publication history, strongly suggest that Motteux was involved, but except for the song, nothing in the play suggests to which author it should be attributed. Farquhar's humorous suffering in Love and Business ("now I'm a dead Man, and the Stage-Coach may most properly be call'd my Herse, . . . .") suggests he was the major author. Rothstein's belief that Motteux was translator and songwriter is altogether plausible, but the exact nature and extent of the collaboration remains a mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. The Phillips Prologue and Epilogue The prologue and epilogue written by Samuel Phillips or Philips has been a source of great confusion. Stonehill discovered the prologue and epilogue in Du 1775 and dubbed it a "mystery." Lawrence believed he had solved the mystery when he realized "Thomas Wilkes," the editor of the 1775 Dublin edition, had printed the text of the ballad opera made from the farce by "John Chetwood" (probably William Rufus Chetwood, the prompter) in 1730 and acted at Drury Lane for his benefit. Phillips' prologue and epilogue, Lawrence concluded, were written for this occasion and benefitted Chetwood rather than Farquhar. In fact, the new prologue and epilogue were printed long before 1775; they appeared in 1718, Du 1719, Du 1728, and Du 1761. The new prologue was, as the text says, "Spoken upon the Revival of this Comedy, at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, some Years since, when acted for the Benefit of the Author," not in 1730 but probably in 1704. Samuel Phillips, a few years Farquhar's junior, probably came to London in 1704. He had matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford, on 30 June 1703, at the age of eighteen; within a year, he had managed to get himself expelled from his fellowship and his university. 24 He must have returned to London very soon thereafter. It seems likely, in fact, that he is the Phillips who briefly turned actor in the summer of 1704. On 7 July Drury Lane gave a performance of The Orphan , "The men's roles by young Gentlemen for their Diversion." A Phillips played Chamont "amongst the Oxford gentlemen" in that production and on 16 August played Bellamour in The Miser . The latter was a benefit for this Phillips from Oxford, who also spoke a new prologue to the town (Avery, I, 70, 72). By January 1705 Phillips had become a regular contributor to the Diverting Post , 25 Bragg's periodical. Phillips also contributed to the Poetical Courant , as did Farquhar, in 1706, and he published Miscellanea Sacra , advertised in January and February 1706 in the Diverting Post but published with the date 1705. There are few recorded performances of The Stage-Coach in these years although it must have played frequently; 2 February 1704 and 16 October 1704 are the only ones at Lincoln's Inn Fields, which still did not advertise regularly. The play was also performed at the Queen's Theatre 16 November 1705, 14 April 1707, and 26 May 1707. The references in the prologue to the condition of the "once-lov'd stage" indicates a performance at Lincoln's Inn Fields: Phillips' discussion of the theater as "some abandon'd mistress of the town, | By long enjoyment stale and nauseous grown," echoes many prologues spoken in 1700-1704 at Lincoln's Inn Fields. The reference to Monimia repeats the sentiment in the prologue to The Different Widows in November 1703 and may refer to the same neglected performance of Otway's The Orphan at Lincoln's Inn Fields. (The performance in which Phillips played was at Drury Lane.) Phillips says Lincoln's Inn Fields "ransack'd the whole globe to find out new" entertainment for the fickle audiences; in 1702-1703 the company had imported Signora Margarita de l'Epine, the famous singer, as well as Signora Maria Margarita Gallia, and L'Abbe to dance. By 1704-1705 the desperate haranguing of audiences at Lincoln's Inn Fields began to subside, as the plans for the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket were being realized. Phillips' prologue, therefore, would necessarily have predated the opening of the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705, for when the company moved there, the sentiments he expressed became obsolete. The conjunction of facts would suggest that Phillips arrived in London in the summer of 1704, performed Chamont at Drury Lane that summer, and wrote the prologue for Lincoln's Inn Fields perhaps for 16 October 1704 or for an unrecorded performance. Although the prologue is captioned "Spoken upon the Revival of this Comedy, at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields some Years since, when acted for the Benefit of the Author," there is no evidence in The London Stage that Farquhar received a benefit on 16 October or any other night; however, his military chronology allows for the fact that he may well have been in London on that date. It is possible, on the other hand, that when the prologue was published fourteen years later, the printer assumed it was a benefit because Phillips asked the audience to "spare | The halfstarv'd poet, tho' you damn the player." This paper is entitled "The Mystery of Farquhar's Stage-Coach Reconsidered" rather than "Solved" because the solution of old mysteries in fact introduces new ones that will probably never be solved. The most intriguing of the new enigmas is why the production and publication of the farce in London was anonymous, hints strewn hither and yon but no open admissions of authorship anywhere. There is no evidence that Farquhar or anyone else had a contract to write for a single house; why then should Lincoln's Inn Fields and Bragg not have taken full advantage of their popular author? Why did Farquhar fail to give the farce to Lintot? Another puzzle is how Curll acquired Phillips' prologue and epilogue for his edition. The cast list he published is that of Drury Lane in 1716-1717 or 1717-1718, 26 and yet he has a copy of the prologue and epilogue at the other house twelve or thirteen years earlier. What is the connection of 1718 with Du 1719 and the Dublin editions that followed? The text links 1718 to Q1 as well as the other Dublin editions, yet the prologue and epilogue apparently originated in 1718, not a Dublin edition as one would expect (unless a Dublin edition was printed between 1704 and 1719), so that Du 1719 seems to have derived from 1718 rather than Q1. What was the relationship and division of duties between Motteux and Farquhar? Did Motteux write more than is apparent, and if so, why did Farquhar complain in his correspondence about so light a writing task? And what exactly were the relationships between the authors and booksellers that collaborated on the publication of plays and periodicals at the time The Stage-Coach was printed? What was the connection of Curll and Feales with Drury Lane later? If the new enigmas are as fascinating as the old ones, they are less capable of proof. Editions, theatrical history, and biographical details will only render facts, not motivations or even unrecorded business and personal relations.</field>

Leo Hughes argues for a performance shortly before 2 February 1704 ( A Century of English Farce [1956], pp. 81-82, n. 20). Robert D.

Eric Rothstein speculates that it was written in summer 1703 for production the following fall ( George Farquhar [1967], p. 24). 3 Prologue, Mary Pix, The Different Widows (London, 1703). The prologue was reprinted in The Works of Rochester and Roscommon (London, 1703) as "Prologue to Different Widows, supposedly by Capt.

Farquhar's The Twin Rivals (1702) also has a Teague, played by Bowen, as was Howard's Teague in 1701 and Macahone at least on 17 and 24 May 1709 and conceivably on earlier occasions for which cast lists do not exist. Teague was, of course, then as now a stock name for a stage Irishman, the stock part popularized by The Committee , which opened at least by 27 November 1662. 5 Willard Connely, Young George Farquhar (1949), pp. 221-222.

      <field name="heading_text">The Publication of Shaftesbury's Letter Concerning Enthusiasm by Richard B. Wolf</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early in his Miscellaneous Reflections on the works collected in volumes one and two of Characteristics , Shaftesbury responds to criticism regarding the structure of A Letter concerning Enthusiasm by citing Jean LeClerc's comment that the absence of systematic argument is appropriate to a work which is a letter, not a treatise. He then proceeds to draw a distinction between true private epistles such as his own (in which order and method are quite properly concealed) and public writings merely masquerading in epistolary form or mongrel letters such as those of Seneca to Lucilius in which "the author by degrees loses sight of his correspondent, and takes the world in general for his reader or disciple." 1 Whether this strict notion of genre was present in Shaftesbury's mind at the time he penned his playful discussion of inspiration and plea for religious tolerance, or whether it developed later as a convenient reply to critics of the Letter , it is probably responsible for supplying us with the most specific composition date for any of the works in Characteristics . When the Letter , originally published in 1708, reappeared in 1711 as the first piece in Shaftesbury's magnum opus, its status as a true epistle was emphasized by the addition of the heading "Sept. 1707." 2 S. F. Whitaker in "The First Edition of Shaftesbury's Moralists " briefly alludes to the story of the manuscript circulation of the Letter in the months between its composition and publication, but a fuller and more accurate account seems desirable. 3 The principal source for such an account is a copybook transcription in Shaftesbury's hand of his letter of March 1707/8 to Lord John Somers, "Lord * * * * *" to whom the Letter concerning Enthusiasm is addressed. This curious document not only reveals that the manuscript Letter had been sent to Brookmans, Somers's Hertfordshire estate, shortly after its composition but also records a subsequent experience which had greatly alarmed the work's author. Dining with a group of clergy and university men, Shaftesbury had been amazed to hear one of the company mention that the author of A Tale of a Tub was about to bring out a new piece addressed to Somers concerning prophecy, "w ch the Author, he said, had taken upon him to treat in a very familiar way of Wit &amp; Rallery, by a handle he had borrowd from the new London Prophets who made such a Noise of late." 4 Privately pressing this speaker for details after the meal, Shaftesbury was given a history of the manuscript's circulation which the man had heard from a friend. An acquaintance to whom Somers had lent the work had given it to "a principle Author," who in turn had passed it among the members of his literary club. Although Shaftesbury's informant could recite choice passages, he admitted that he had never actually seen the manuscript, but he added that he had been assured that the work was presently at the press and would shortly be published, as Shaftesbury wrote Somers, "with a Title-Page bearing y r Ld ps Name: a notable help to y e Book-Seller, especially when joynd with that of your pretended good Friend the Author of y e Tale of a Tub " (p. 69). Perhaps to minimize Somers's embarrassment in an awkward situation, Shaftesbury expressed scepticism about the possibility of imminent publication, speculating that this part of the story might have been invented by one of the early borrowers to prevent further circulation and to hasten the return of the manuscript. He noted with evident concern, however, that he had since learned that a copy of the work remained in the hands of the principal author. Shaftesbury's letter of March 1707/8 is prefaced with his request that Somers conceal or burn the Letter concerning Enthusiasm —a request which was probably an indirect appeal to his correspondent to recall the manuscript or to exert his influence to squelch further circulation and possible publication. Shaftesbury's uneasiness about seeing the work in print was not, as he told Somers, on account of any ill consequences that might befall its author but because "in y e beginning . . . he has accidentally exposd y e weakness of a poor old Prelate who tho he was once a professd Informer from the Roof &amp; Board (one might say Service too) of your Friend's [Shaftesbury's] Ancestour, yet your Friend, whether as an Enthusiast, or as a sound Christian, has too scrupulouse a Conscience to make such a seeming angry Return. And considering the old Clergy-Man's better Service to y e protestant Religion &amp; Whigg-Cause in la[t]er Times, your Friend woud be unwilling to do any thing y t might look like an exposing the Man publickly" (p. 69). The passage to which Shaftesbury referred was plainly his allusion in the Letter to "an eminent, learned, and truly Christian prelate you once knew, who could have given you a full account of his belief in fairies" (I, 7). The man in question was Edward Fowler, Bishop of Gloucester, who had supplied the Cambridge Platonist Henry More with accounts of ghosts and spirits. 5 Although Fowler's role in betraying one of Shaftesbury's forebears (the notorious first earl?) is obscure, the prelate's later good service to Protestantism and the Whigs may have included his vigorous arguments before the London clergy against the reading of James II's first Declaration of Indulgence in 1687 and the answer to a Jacobite pamphlet which reportedly earned him his bishopric in 1691. 6 Some four months after his appeal to Somers, Shaftesbury, despite his reluctance on Fowler's account, allowed the Letter concerning Enthusiasm to be published by John Morphew, a major purveyor of tracts on the London prophets. Justifying his decision to Somers in a letter of July 12, 1708, which accompanied a printed copy of the work, the author observed that "'Twas meer Fortune It came not out in Print before now since a Printer severall Months ago had it left in his hands by some of those Persons formerly mentiond. Others have done it the honour to coppy pieces of it in their Letters w ch . your Friend [Shaftesbury] has seen, &amp; have given it the advantage of their own Dress: in w ch . it was likely to come abroad soon into the world amongst the Writings of those Gentlemen who frequently supply the Press, and borrow freely of one another or whoever else comes in their way." 7 Although the Letter was published with neither his own nor Somers's name, Shaftesbury thought these would probably be guessed not only because of the manuscript's circulation in the club of authors but also because the man who had originally borrowed the work from Somers had shown it to friends of the author, "who knew him intimately, &amp; coud discover his correcting hand" (p. 86). While there is no reason to believe that the printed Letter contained any major departures from the original manuscript, Shaftesbury, in a postscript which is crossed out in the surviving copybook transcript of his letter of July 12, called Somers's attention to two small changes in the passage concerning Fowler: "If your Lord sp . can think the enclos'd worth a second reading in this new Character, you will find among other slight Corrections one w ch . relates to the old Bishop. The change of a Tense has put him out of y e way of Reflection &amp; a good Epethite or two bestow'd on him, saves the breach of Charity in one who would willingly say all the Good of him that he cou'd, &amp; conceal the rest" (p. 87). Shaftesbury's letter of July 12 to Somers is the earliest known notice of the publication of A Letter concerning Enthusiasm . No evidence of contemporary attribution to Shaftesbury survives, and the printed work, like the manuscript, was apparently believed by many to be the product of the author of A Tale of a Tub . Swift indeed felt obliged to deny his authorship privately to three different correspondents as well as publicly in the Apology first printed with the fifth edition of the Tale (1710). 8 Publication in no way diminished the notoriety of the Letter . In the August 1708 issue of his Censura Temporum , the Reverend Samuel Parker dubbed it "Nine or ten Sheets full of such flagrant Buffoonry, Raillery and Ridicule upon all Religion, Natural as well as Reveal'd, as are enough to shock an ordinary Atheist," and declared, "When I read it, almost every Period seem'd to come like a Flash from Hell. And at this time I can't look into't without trembling." 9 In late 1708 an anonymous French translation appeared in Holland, and the next year the author of the third full-length response to the work complained that it was "industriously spread in the Nation; put, by way of ABC, into the hands of every young Fellow, who begins to speak great swelling Words, against what he Will not Understand, because he is Resolv'd not to Practice: And sent, by way of Mission, into Foreign Parts, upon that hopeful Project! which is now the Heroick Passion of exalted Spirits , the saving of Men's Sense , by the Damning of their Souls!" 10 None of Shaftesbury's other works was to arouse such immediate and intense controversy. In view of the reception accorded the Letter , it is not at all surprising that two English editions of the work exist, although no one to my knowledge has ever noted the fact. Both bear the date 1708, but over half of the pages of the second consist of a line for line resetting of the first, while the remainder were reimpressed from standing type. Collation of six copies of the first edition and five of the second reveals no intermixing of the two sets of sheets, a finding which suggests that copies of the first edition had been gathered before printing of the second was begun. The order of 1708 editions can be conjectured on the basis of a correction introduced into standing type before reimpression: the omission of the redundant second "chiefly" from the sentence "'Tis in Adversity chiefly, or in ill Health, under Affliction, or Disturbance of Mind, or Discomposure of Temper, that we have chiefly recourse to it" (p. 50, lines 7-11). 11 The dropping of end type during the process of reimpression is probably responsible for two apparent errors on reimpressed page 74: the omission of a comma after " essent " (line 1) and omission of the final 's' of the catchword "sets." Improper spacing above the quotation at the top of page 72 is probably the result of another reimpression mishap, which created both vertical and horizontal shifting in the top half of the page.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Characteristics , ed. John M. Robertson (1900), II, 170. Hereafter cited in the text. 2 Shaftesbury's concern with establishing the identity of the Letter as a true epistle may also be reflected in his insertion of additional indications of direct address ("My Lord") in the 1711 version. The September date is consistent with the work's reference to a Bartholomew Fair puppet show staged "at this very time" (I, 21). In Shaftesbury's day the fair generally began on August 24 (St. Bartholomew's Day) and lasted about two weeks. Another possible confirmation of the date is provided by a one-sentence Latin note of September 6, 1707, which Shaftesbury's protégé Paul Crelle sent his patron from Oxford (Public Record Office, Shaftesbury Papers, PRO 30/24/45, pt. 3). Crelle wrote that he had located a copy of Polyaenus' Strategematum in one of the Oxford libraries and had decided to transcribe the passage he and Shaftesbury had discussed concerning the origin of the word "panic" (the note's inconclusiveness suggests that it accompanied this transcription). Had Shaftesbury asked Crelle to check the source of the etymological anecdote he wished to employ in the Letter (I, 12-13)? 3 Whitaker writes: "It is true that the Letter concerning Enthusiasm had been first communicated in manuscript; and it seems that an indiscretion on the part of Shaftesbury's patron nearly led to the publication by certain of his enemies of a clandestine edition with the author's name revealed. The provocation was, in particular, a satirical remark about Bishop Fowler's belief in fairies—a remark which Shaftesbury later modified. However, the Letter duly came to be printed at the author's own instigation, in the form that has become well known as the first treatise of the Characteristics " ( The Library , 5th Ser., 7 [1952], 235). Although Whitaker cites the two letters upon which I base the present account, I can find no grounds in either for his inferences that the near-publication of the Letter was the work of enemies of Shaftesbury and was provoked by the allusion to Fowler. 4 PRO 30/24/22, no. 4, p. 68. Hereafter cited in the text. 5 Four of Fowler's accounts had been published after More's death in Joseph Glanvill's Saducismus Triumphatus (London, 1681), II, 230-231, 238-250. Fowler's identity as the prelate in the Letter was first recorded in the anonymous French translation Lettre sur l'enthousiasme (Hague, 1709), p. 9. 6 A[lexander] G[orden], "Fowler, Edward, D.D.," DNB (ca. 1885). 7 PRO 30/24/22, no. 4, pp. 86-87. Hereafter cited in the text. Benjamin Rand's transcription of this letter on pp. 386-387 of his Life, Unpublished Letters , and Philosophical Regimen of Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury (1900) is slightly inaccurate. 8 For the letters (to Ambrose Philips, Charles Ford, and Robert Hunter), see Harold Williams, ed., The Correspondence of Jonathan Swift (1963-65), I, 100, 110, 122. Swift's playful attribution of the Letter concerning Enthusiasm to Hunter in his letter to that friend apparently misled the dean's early nineteenth-century editor John Nichols, who cited Hunter as the work's author in his Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century ([1812-16; rpt. 1966], I, 339 n., VI, 89 n.). The error was perpetuated (although secondary attributions to Swift and Shaftesbury were recorded) in Halkett and Laing's Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous English Literature , which is probably responsible for the author cards bearing Hunter's name that appear in some library card catalogues today. For Swift's denial of authorship in his Apology, see A Tale of a Tub, To which is added the Battle of the Books and the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit , ed. A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith (2d. ed., 1958), p. 6. 9 1 (1708), 244. 10 [Mary Astell], Bart'lemy Fair: or, an Enquiry after Wit (1709), p. 23. 11 This ordering of editions suggests that the other substantive variant in the Letter , which necessitated the overrunning of a line on a reset page, may also be a correction: the omission of the unidiomatic "in" from the phrase "excluded in a Being" (p. 60, lines 7-8). The original infelicity was noted by the author of the first full-length reply to the work (probably Bishop Fowler), who offered his own correction: "I would rather have said out of " ( Remarks upon the Letter to a Lord concerning Enthusiasm [1708], p. 37).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">George Steevens's 1785 Variorum Shakespeare by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William C. Woodson's note on "The 1785 Variorum Shakespeare" in Studies in Bibliography for 1975 (pp. 318-320) while concerned primarily with the text of that edition attempts to trace the progress of editions from 1778 forward to the Furness variorum series. Certain statements made by Professor Woodson need to be corrected. Isaac Reed, "engaged" by Steevens "to edit anew the 1778 Variorum . . . worked quickly and produced in 1785 a ten-volume Shakespeare, with minimal changes in the commentary, and presenting what has been called a 'careless reprint' of the 1778 text." I have no quarrel with Professor Woodson's own conclusions about the place of the 1785 edition in the transmission of Shakespeare's text, but his statements about Reed and, in particular, about the 1785 commentary are another matter. In April 1783, Steevens wrote to Edmond Malone and to Isaac Reed, suggesting that the former edit Shakespeare, and, a few days later, telling the latter that he was turning over his Shakespeare materials to him and wishing him luck with his edition of Shakespeare, which was eventually published at the end of 1785. Now Reed would have had to act very quickly indeed to have prepared the text and commentary for the ten-volume edition in approximately two and a half years. Actually, Steevens handed over a substantial portion of the edition, including some 445 additions, revisions and omissions in his own 1778 notes. Another approximately 470 notes are given over to reductions in the number of parallels Steevens had lavished on passages in the 1778 edition and to cross-references, by volume and page, to other parts of the same 1785 edition. A few of these 470 notes represent the omission of some bridging remarks, necessary in 1778 but rendered unnecessary by the omission in 1785 of the note or notes of previous editors and commentators. Together, these 900 or more notes comprise the greatest addition to the 1785 Variorum, although a number of people contributed to it. Reed himself contributed some 210 notes and was probably responsible for the reduction of the number of parallels in Steevens's notes and for the many cross-references within the volumes of the edition, although these are all signed "Steevens," Reed's notes being signed "Editor," as he had not allowed his name to appear on the title-page or elsewhere. I should stress the fact that Reed's public contribution to Shakespeare studies up to this time had consisted of but two notes in the 1778 Shakespeare . Reed included some notes by John Monck Mason and a greater number by Joseph Ritson, these latter being attributed to "Remarks," a shortened title of Ritson's attack on the 1778 Shakespeare . Dr. Richard Farmer contributed thirty-nine suggestions, all of them appearing in notes by Steevens, some further indication of the extent of Steevens's involvement in the edition. Peter Whalley also made three observations which found their way into Steevens's notes, as well as contributing a number of notes himself. The 1785 variorum is, therefore, the 1778 edition with additions, in order of number, by Steevens, Malone, Reed, Whalley, the actor John Henderson, and Stephen Weston. But the power behind the editorial throne was Steevens. Indeed, in his brief unsigned Advertisement Reed wrote that the additions to the 1778 Shakespeare "are such as have been supplied by the last Editor [Steevens], and the principal of the living Commentators" [Malone, Farmer, et al.]. Professor Woodson states that the 1785 edition is important because "it marks a new phase in the history of Shakespeare editions and in the lives of the most prominent editors at the turn of the eighteenth century. That the 1785 Variorum exacerbated the quarrel between Steevens and Malone has been recognized before and attributed to the 1785 notes in which Malone challenged Steevens; indeed, it was over difficulties that arose in responding to the notes that Steevens broke off correspondence with Malone. Steevens never bridged the quarrel and undertook his 1793 edition by most accounts to prevent reissue of Malone's 1790 Shakespeare . . . The importance of the 1785 Variorum, then, is that it drew Steevens back into editing, and so indirectly helped in perfecting the variorum concept." The fullest account of the quarrel, if this be not too harsh a word, between Steevens and Malone, is by John Nichols in his Literary Illustrations and is the basis for the account in Prior's life of Malone and other later accounts. Nichols narrates how, after publication of the 1785 edition, Steevens had asked Malone to retain in his, Malone's, forthcoming edition those notes in which Malone had differed with him, and to retain them unchanged. Malone could not, of course, make such a promise, and Steevens declared that all further communication between them on the subject of Shakespeare was therefore at an end (V, 450). But the friction between the two men at this time has been exaggerated, the two large areas of difference between the two being the respective authority of the first and second Folios and the merits of Shakespeare's poetry. Malone contributed only five new notes to the 1785 variorum, and Steevens added comments to eight of Malone's 1778 notes, so that the possible fresh disagreements between the two, those which, according to Professor Woodson, "exacerbated the quarrel" between them reside in thirteen notes. Twenty-seven of Malone's notes from his 1780 Supplement to the 1778 Shakespeare and four from his 1783 Second Supplement (privately printed in fifty copies) were reprinted in 1785. In addition to the five new notes (1785, I,144.8; II, 468.5; V,197.9, 256.1, 262.5) Malone added a last sentence, "Since I wrote the above, I have found my conjecture confirmed; for so reads the first folio," to one of his 1783 notes (see 1785, III,488.1). A few of Malone's old notes replaced Steevens's 1778 notes, especially in textual matters, and Steevens added his own comments to some of Malone's old notes. Rarely were the two in agreement, but their differences were expressed in either polite or formal terms; nowhere in their exchanges is there the suggestion of any real acrimony. When Malone in 1780, added a comment to one of Steevens's 1778 notes, Steevens's rejoinder was, "I am not induced by this reasoning to follow the folio" (I,288.6), one of the more severe expressions of disagreement. The most extended exchange between the two comes in their interpretations of Macbeth's "multitudinous seas" (IV,529.9) and is too long to quote here. Another notable exchange comes at that juncture where Hamlet accuses his mother of knowledge of King Hamlet's murder. Malone had quoted two passages from The History of Hamblet which tended to put the Queen in a good light, from which he concluded that "in the drama neither the king or queen make so good a defence. Shakspeare wished to render them as odious as he could, and therefore has not in any part of the play furnished them with even the semblance of an excuse for their conduct." Steevens did not know "in what part of this tragedy the king and queen could have been expected to enter into a vindication of their mutual conduct. The former indeed is rendered contemptible as well as guilty; but for the latter our poet seems to have felt all the tenderness which the ghost recommends to the imitation of her son" (X,420.3). Here, too, as in differences of opinion on less vital aspects of the plays, Steevens treated Malone with respect. Further, the post-1785 relations between the two men, while they probably were not cordial, were not marked by open hostility. They, and Reed, were in Cambridge, the guests of Dr. Richard Farmer in 1787, and while Reed records only one dinner party attended by both during a fortnight's stay, there is no suggestion of estrangement. 1 On November 23, 1790, Mr. Steevens presented "his best compliments and thanks to Mr. Malone, for his very acceptable present of two sets of Shakespeare. Though Mr. S. has no occasion for a third copy, he begs leave to acknowledge the liberality of Mr. Malone's offer." 2 Steevens had contributed to Malone's 1790 Shakespeare , although there are few new notes by anybody other than Malone himself. The most notable of Steevens's contributions to Malone's edition is in the prolegomenious matter in Volume I, Part i, and is a long five-page footnote (pp. 359-363) on Thomas Middleton's The Witch , discovered in manuscript by Steevens and privately published in a limited number of copies by Reed in 1778. In addition to this, Steevens contributed three notes elsewhere in the prolegomena, a long one on the Sir Thomas Lucy affair and two shorter ones. 3 Analysis of the 1790 commentary on Macbeth , Steevens's favourite play, reveals that he contributed three new notes, added to three others, and changed one. 4 However, there are no new contributions by him in Measure for Measure , chosen at random for collation with the 1785 edition, so that only complete collation of the editions would reveal exactly how much he contributed to the 1790 edition. But it is obvious that he did not adhere to his vow not to communicate with Malone on matters Shakespearian. Malone, as late as April 23, 1792 when he signed his Letter to the Rev. Richard Farmer , D.D., wrote of Steevens Twenty six years have now elapsed since Mr. Steevens issued out proposals for publishing the plays of Shakspeare, of which in that period he has given the publick three editions, each of them elaborated with his utmost care and diligence. The year 1766, in which his proposals first came forth, should be doubly dear to every intelligent reader of this poet; not only as the era when that gentleman first undertook the arduous task of illustrating his dramas by the contemporary writers, a task which he executed with great ability, but because the most conclusive Essay* that ever appeared on a subject of criticism, was then written, and the long-agitated question concerning the learning of Shakspeare was for ever decided. In the year 1780, fourteen years after Mr. Steevens's work was first undertaken, and two years after the second edition of it had appeared, I published a Supplement to that edition in two volumes, in the preface to which is the paragraph above quoted. Having a very high opinion of the diligence, acuteness, and learning of Mr. Steevens, to whom all the admirers of Shakespeare have great obligations, I in common with the rest of the publick considered myself as much indebted to his labours; and therefore did not then hesitate to say that the text of the author on which he had been above twelve years employed, seemed to be finally settled. If I had used a still stronger phrase, some allowance might be made for the partiality of friendship, and for that respect which is due from every scholar to acknowledged abilities and learning." The "most conclusive Essay" referred to is Farmer's Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare , 1767. Malone's Letter to Farmer was in reply to Joseph Ritson's Cursory Criticisms on Malone's 1790 Shakespeare . Steevens, now on terms of some intimacy with Ritson, was barely mentioned in the Cursory Criticisms and then in commendation of one of his rare emendations (p. 67). Indeed, Ritson had contributed rather extensively to Steevens's 1793 Shakespeare . Malone must have felt himself attacked by both men, possibly even working in conjunction, for on more than one occasion Steevens printed a note by Malone, Ritson's attack on the note, and then his own adverse criticism of Malone's note. Or Steevens would write a comment on a note by Malone which Ritson had already attacked in his Criticisms . One example: Malone had declared that "tickled" in a line in 2 Henry VI was trisyllabic and the editor of the second folio, "not perceiving this," had emended the line and had been "followed by all the subsequent editors." Ritson disagreed, saying among other things, that the editor of the second folio "has had the use of his ears, which is more than can be said for his Hiberian successor" (p. 71). In his note in 1793, Steevens wrote, "Were Mr. Malone's supposition adopted, the verse would still halt most lamentably. I am therefore content with the emendation of the second folio, a book to which we are all indebted for restorations of our author's metre." This would have been enough, surely, without the gratuitously insulting last sentence: "I am unwilling to publish what no ear, accustomed to harmony, can endure." Some months after Steevens's edition had been out, Malone wrote to Lord Charlemont about the new edition he, Malone, was engaged upon. He complained again of his treatment at Steevens's hands and then wrote, "He shall find me what he has not spirit enough to be himself, an open and, I trust, an honourable adversary. The taking up such a despicable fellow as Ritson by way of co-adjutor, a man for whom he had the most profound contempt (of which I have a testimony under his hand), and who had published the most illiberal and scurrilous invectives against several persons whom he pretends to call his friends [Warton, Percy, and Malone himself] . . . is such an aggravation of all the other paltry acts that he has employed, that I am resolved to give him no quarter." 5 In the Advertisement to his 1793 Shakespeare Steevens wrote, of his failure to reprint Shakespeare's non-dramatic poetry, that this was so "notwithstanding these miscellaneous Poems have derived every possible advantage from the literature and judgment of their only intelligent editor, Mr. Malone, whose implements of criticism, like the ivory rake and golden spade in Prudentius, are on this occasion disgraced by the objects of their culture" (p. vii). Later, he wrote of the last editor, i.e. Malone, "whose attention, diligence, and spirit of enquiry, have far exceeded those of the whole united phalanx of his predecessors" and whose additions to the account of Shakespeare's life, whose attempt to fix the chronology of the plays, and whose account of the ancient English stage he was reprinting (p. xxi). He then rehearsed the differences between himself and Malone, but largely in a light vein, feeling confident that Malone would join "with us in considering no small proportion of our contested readings as a mere game at literary push-pin" (p. xxx). One of the recipients of the fifteen-volume 1793 Shakespeare was, of course, Edmond Malone. Given the presence of a large number of notes in which he was attacked by Steevens, it is small wonder that Malone should express his anger, even if only privately and to friends. Indeed, as early as August 7, 1792, even before Steevens's Shakespeare was published, having evidently had access to the sheets of Romeo and Juliet or to the actual volume containing it, the penultimate volume in the edition, Malone wrote to Lord Charlemont, "I find Mr. Steevens has printed 'Romeo and Juliet' from my edition, having taken seventy of eighty of the emendations" (Charlemont MSS, II, 197). On October 28, 1793, Lord Charlemont wrote to Malone, telling him he had seen, but emphatically not bought, Steevens's edition. "You know," he told his friend, "I always disliked the man, and certainly the manner in which he mentions you has by no means diminished my dislike. In all he says there is but too visibly a feeble, though, thanks to his slender abilities, a fruitless attempt to 'damn with faint praise,' which is certainly the species of satire least creditable to its author" (Charlemont MSS, II, 219). Malone promised Lord Charlemont in a letter of May 27, 1794 that he would "hurl back some of the darts which Steevens has so liberally thrown me" (Charlemont MSS, II, 238). And in several letters to Bishop Percy, the first in October 1793, a few months after publication of the 1793 edition, and the rest after Steevens's death in 1800, Malone catalogued his grievances. 6 Three years later Malone sent Steevens a copy of his Inquiry into the authenticity of the Ireland papers. Steevens's acknowledgement, dated April 1, 1796, reads, "Mr. Stephens presents his best Compliments to Mr. Malone and most sincerely thanks him for his very elegant present, which exhibits one of the mose decisive pieces of criticism, that was ever produced." 7 While it is true, then, that Steevens succeeded in hurting and angering the courteous Malone, it was not until publication of the 1793 Shakespeare that he did so—decidedly not in the 1785 variorum, his, Steevens's, variorum.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">George Crabbe: Murray's 1834 Edition of the Life and Poems by Thomas C. Faulkner</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Given the obvious fact that George Crabbe's popularity was never comparable to that of Byron or Scott and that Murray had failed to recover half of the £3,000. which he had paid Crabbe in 1819 for the copyright of the Tales of the Hall and his previously published works, to launch after Crabbe's death an eight-volume complete edition of his poetry, which included a single-volume biography, was in Murray's own view a highly speculative venture. 1 It could and did succeed because of Murray's knowledge of the literary market-place and his ability to design the edition to make it saleable in large numbers to middle-class readers for 5 shillings a volume. Murray explained his successful method of publication in a letter to George Crabbe, Jr. at the beginning of negotiations (in February 1833) for the biography and posthumous poems of his father, which of course were not included in Murray's copyright acquisition in 1819: "What makes me now think of republishing after this gloomy statement [of the sale of two collected editions published in the 1820's], is, that a great taste for purchasing favourite authors has been created by bringing them out, splendidly embellished, exceedingly cheap and in Monthly Volumes. If I could get a good life of Crabbe (and I know it would be an interesting one) with as much as possible of his unpublished poetry as may prove to be as good as those already printed I am disposed to venture an edition uniform with the edition of Lord Byron's Works now publishing in Monthly Volumes" (JM to GCJ [Yale, Hilles], 28 Feb. 1833). Seven months later, when an agreement with Crabbe's sons still had not been reached, Murray declared his "firm belief that I possess the means, in myself, for no other person has it, of raising [Crabbe] to a popularity equal to that of Scott &amp; Byron" and reveals that he has sold 19,000 copies of the last monthly volume of Byron's works. He offers to pay ½ of the profits of each and every edition of the first and last volumes—the Life and Posthumous Poems (A.L.S., JM to GCJ [Yale, Hilles], 4 Sept. 1833). When Crabbe's elder son inquired as to the extent of expenses before profit, Murray was initially guarded in his answer, explaining that "It is a speculation, the probable success of which can not be ascertained, until I see the effect occasioned by the advertisements, prospectus, travelling, and other means, which I must put in operation for exciting public attention to it" (A.L.S., JM to GCJ [Yale, Hilles], 13 Sept. 1833). Subsequently he became more specific and improved his offer, proposing an initial printing of 5,000 copies and estimating that because of the "great outlay on Drawing, Engraving, Stereotyping, and Advertising," the profit will be no more than 207£ per volume on the first printing. However, he now offered Crabbe's sons the entire profit of the first printing of the first and last volumes, estimated at 414£, and ⅔ of the profit of each subsequent printing of 5,000, which he estimated at 850£ in all (JM to GCJ [Murray, fol. 127], 13 Sept. 1833). This offer was accepted and Murray replied that he has "no doubt of the success of the undertaking nor that it will render your Father's Name and Character so popular that it will almost force the Bishops or the Government to do something advantageous for both [sons]." And he adds, "You can form no conception of the vastness of our preparations" (JM to GCJ [Murray, fol. 128], 23 Sept. 1833). The "preparations" began with the issue in October of a prospectus, consisting of a single quarto gathering in green printed wrappers announcing publication of the edition in eight monthly volumes at 5 shillings each, commencing in February 1834. The Prospectus included a specimen engraving by Finden which was not subsequently included in the set issued to embellish the edition. 2 Next, Murray engaged John Gibson Lockhart to "rewrite" the Life and "superintend the Works generally" for the sum of 300£, to be paid on the day of publication of the Life , and an additional 200£ to be paid when the sale exceeded 10,000 copies. An additional 100£ was offered to Lockhart to write a review of the work for the Quarterly Review —which Lockhart edited and Murray published (JM to JGL [Murray, fol. 131], 16 Oct. 1833). The nature and extent of Lockhart's revision cannot be fully determined because the manuscript has not survived, but sufficient information about the revision is available to allow a tentative assessment to be formed. Estimation of his contribution is important because the Life of Crabbe by His Son is generally recognized as a classic early biography, the best between Boswell's Johnson and Lockhart's Scott , and of course because it is the major primary source, apart from the poems, for all subsequent biographies of Crabbe and critical studies of his poetry. Further, Lockhart's work on the Life of Crabbe was apprentice work for his monumental biography of Scott, which he began to write as soon as his work on the Crabbe edition was completed (A.L.S., JW to GCJ [Yale, Hilles], 19 Dec. 1834). The manuscript which was given to Lockhart to "rewrite" in September 1833 had already been thoroughly rewritten by George Crabbe, Jr. following receipt of criticism of the first draft from his brother, John; Thomas Moore; Samuel Rogers; Lord Holland; and Sarah Hoare. Crabbe's eldest son had actually nearly completed a brief biography of his father before his death and submitted his early draft to Thomas Moore for criticism within a few months of the funeral. He found the manuscript fascinating but advised that "irrelative matter" be omitted (A.L.S., GCJ to TM [Bodleian, fol. 135], 25 April 1832). Samuel Rogers asked Lord Holland for an opinion and replied to George Crabbe, Jr. that "It is indeed, as he [Lord Holland] says, very interesting; but much is [needed to make] it fit for publication" (A.L., SR to GCJ [Leeds], 24 Feb. 183[3]). Subsequently, the manuscript was carefully read by John Crabbe and Sarah Hoare, the daughter of the London Banker Samuel Hoare, with whose family Crabbe had been intimate for a dozen years (A.L.S., JC to GCJ [Leeds], 28 [April 1832]; [May 1832]; 5 May 1832). Further revisions were made as a result of their suggestions, most of which were aimed at suppressing unseemly detail or removing the potential for embarrassing living persons. But in addition to meeting specific criticisms of details, the poet's son successfully endeavoured to obtain more material to incorporate into the revised manuscript. In May of 1833 he wrote to Elizabeth Leadbeater Cole, the daughter of the Irish Quaker authoress Mary Leadbeater, for permission to use portions of her mother's letters to his father and asking if any of Crabbe's letters to her mother were extant and if he might use them? (A.L.S., GCJ to [ELC] [B.L.], 3 May 1833) Mrs. Cole was happy to oblige and George Crabbe, Jr. euphorically wrote to Murray in July that he has "received the most valuable letters from Ballitore, exceeding all my hopes—letters addressed to the late Mrs. Leadbeater in which my Father describes himself &amp; speaks of his writings " (A.L.S., GCJ to JM [Bodleian, fols. 116-17], 5 July 1833). However, he was very disappointed in the content of letters which his father had written to an old friend, the Reverend Richard Turner of Great Yarmouth, and found them to be "of little or no use." His most bitter disappointment, though, was the refusal of Sarah Hoare, acting on the advice of William Wordsworth, to make available the letters Crabbe had written to her (Huchon, p. ix; A.L.S., JM to GCJ [Leeds], 4 May 1833). This correspondence is lost and was probably destroyed by Miss Hoare, herself. Finally, after the revised manuscript was in Lockhart's hands, he and Rogers decided on still another expedient to enrich the materials—to ask eminent literary friends of Crabbe to contribute reminiscences in the form of letters to Crabbe's son which would be printed in the biography. 3 This was hastily done and such letters were printed from Moore, Bowles, Joanna Baillie, and Lockhart himself! 4 In addition to these materials, Lockhart was supplied with a biographical sketch of Crabbe written by Sarah Hoare and intended by her to be an anonymous introduction to a volume of Crabbe's posthumous poems which she assumed would be an independent publication. 5 Although her sketch was found to be unsatisfactory by Murray's editor, John Wright, who said of it that "A Memoir such as Miss H[oare] had drawn up would have dropped still-born from the press and rendered a republication of the Poems a dangerous speculation" (A.L.S., JW to GCJ [Leeds], 5 March 1834), it is my belief that Lockhart did make use of the sketch in his revision. In particular, I suggest, on stylistic grounds, that the long quotation in the final chapter of the Life describing Crabbe's physical decline in old age was taken from her sketch. 6 The following brief sample is sufficient to show the character of the passage and probably of the entire sketch. She writes, paraphrasing Cicero, that in old age, " Nature discovers her destitute state, and manifests it in peevishness and repining, unless a higher principle than Nature takes possession of the mind, and makes it sensible, that, 'though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.' It was by this principle that Mr. Crabbe was actuated; and he at times gave such proofs of his confidence in the promises of the Gospel, that the spot on which he expressed these hopes with peculiar energy is now looked upon by the friend who conversed with him as holy ground" ( Life , pp. 296-97). By far the greatest alteration Lockhart made in the manuscript was radical condensation—amounting to excision of nearly 50%—of what George Crabbe, Jr. had written, with the cuts being especially severe in letters which had been incorporated into the biography (A.L.S., JC to GCJ [Leeds], 5 March 1834). The condensation was occasioned by the limitation of the biography to one foolscap octavo volume, required by Murray's format as announced in the Prospectus issued in October 1833. The letters of Crabbe's sons, following publication of the Life , are filled with regret that so few letters were printed. For example, George Crabbe Jr. wrote to Lady Pleasance Smith that "many more [letters] would have been interspersed with a larger portion of narration had not Mr. Murray miscalculated the probable bulk in his prospectus and agreement with the booksellers" (A.L.S., GCJ to Lady Pleasance Smith [Yale, Osborn], 17 March 1834). John Crabbe even suggested to his brother "could you not offer Mr. Murray a second Volume, allowing him a larger Share?" (A.L.S., JC to GCJ [Leeds], 5 March 1834) In addition to regrets about substantial abridgement, George Crabbe, Jr. had serious reservations about the propriety of taking credit for being the sole author of the book. He alludes to Lockhart's role in the Preface, saying, "I cannot conclude without expressing my sense of the important assistance which has been rendered to me, in finally correcting my work and arranging it for the press, by a friend high in the scale of literary distinction; who, however, does not permit me to mention his name on this occasion" ( Life , p. viii). He had desired a complete disclosure of Lockhart's role, but was over-ruled. He had written to Lockhart when he returned proofs of the Life that he "should not feel reconciled to myself did I not confess to the public in that Introduction that my share has been little more than that of a Compiler &amp; that I have scarcely a right to put my name to the volume" (A.L.S., GCJ to JGL [N.L.S., fols. 100-101], 4 Jan. 183[4]). Lockhart's reasons for suppressing his role are evident and not the least of them is the fact that any revelation would have made it impossible for him to write a review of the work for publication in the Quarterly Review , for which Murray, as has been mentioned, agreed to pay him £100. This review, appearing soon after the publication of the Life , was an important item in Murray's promotional activity, and Lockhart begins by puffing the format, inexpensive price, splendid illustrations, and particularly recommends Crabbe's poetry and this edition to the middle classes: This is the first of a series of eight volumes, in which we are about to have before us the life, journals, and annotated poems of Mr. Crabbe, in the same portable shape, and at the same rate of cost, as the Life and Works of Lord Byron, and the poetry of Sir Walter Scott; illustrated, moreover, in the same exquisite manner, by designs from our best artists. We hardly doubt that this attempt to extend the circulation of Crabbe's poetry, especially among the least affluent classes of the community, will be attended with as much success as either of the previous adventures to which we have alluded. Placed by Byron, Scott, Fox, and Canning, and, we believe, by every one of his eminent contemporaries, in the very highest rank of excellence, Crabbe has never yet become familiar to hundreds of thousands of English readers well qualified to appreciate and enjoy his merits. "The Poet of the poor," as his son justly styles him, has hitherto found little favour except with the rich; and yet, of all English authors, he is the one who has sympathized the most profoundly and tenderly with the virtues and the sorrows of humble life—who has best understood the fervours of lowly love and affection—and painted the anxieties and vicissitudes of toil and penury with the closest fidelity and the most touching pathos. In his works the peasant and the mechanic will find everything to elevate their aspirations, and yet nothing to quicken envy and uncharitableness. . . . He only needs an introduction into the cottage, to supplant there for ever the affected sentimentality and gross sensualism of authors immeasurably below him in vigour and capacity of mind, as well as in dignity of heart and character, who have, from accidental circumstances, outrun him for a season in the race of popularity. ( Quarterly Review , 50 [1834]:468) At the end of his forty-page review, Lockhart draws attention to another promotional feature of the edition, its rather elaborate annotation consisting of biographical notes, variant passages, parallel passages from other poets, and excerpts from reviews. Lockhart points out that "we have in the present volume several interesting specimens of the style in which [the poet] enlarged, condensed, or metamorphosed the subjects with which his observation of life furnished him, and we are led to expect a rich store of such information in the shape of notes to the poems, old and new, about to be included in an uniform and authoritative edition" (p. 506). Of the four classes of notes, it is certain that Crabbe's son contributed the biographical ones and at least supplied Murray, Lockhart, and Wright with the manuscripts for the variant passages, but it is equally certain that with his small knowledge of, and general distaste for, poetry he could not have supplied the other two classes of notes, which were probably written by Wright. The appropriateness of the extensive annotation was challenged by William Empson in an unsigned review in the Edinburgh Review for January 1835. Empson declares that "In proportion, too, as the text itself is interesting, a reader is provoked, as often as he is interrupted, by unnecessary and unmeaning notes. From the want of judgment displayed by the editor in this part of his office, we have been loath to draw too large an inference to the discredit of his general qualifications to be the biographer of his father. But where he had little or nothing to communicate, he had far better have plainly told us so, than load his pages with the semblance of parallel passages from Southey down to D'Israeli, and with extracts from contemporary reviews. A son was not wanted for this purpose. The common hangers-on of literature would thankfully have contributed any amount of this species of annotation at so much a-yard" ( Edinburgh Review , 60 [1834-35]:278). Crabbe's son was angered by this attack, and especially so since not he, but one of those "hangers-on of literature" was the guilty party. He wrote a reply to the Edinburgh and sent it to Lockhart for delivery. Naturally enough, Lockhart counseled silence and apparently George Crabbe, Jr. let the matter drop (A.L.S., JGL to GCJ [Leeds], 9 March 1835). How successful, then, was the 1834 edition? In 1952, Franklin Batdorf published an article built around the accounts in the Stock Books of John Murray for the 1834 edition and its various subsequent printings. 7 And in general, his figures agree with reports through the end of 1835 sent to George Crabbe, Jr. by Wright (A.L.S.'s, JW to GCJ [Yale, Hilles], 31 May 1834, 27 Aug. 1834, 10 Dec. 1834, 19 Dec. 1834). Volume I, the Life , sold 8,292 copies by the end of 1835; Vol. II, 6,369; Vol. III, 6,115; Vol. IV, 5,986; Vol. V, 5,878; Vol. VI, 5,838; Vol. VII, 5,822; and Vol. VIII, the Posthumous Poems, 6,124 (Batdorf, p. 194). As was stated above, the profit on the first printing of 5,000 was estimated by Murray at £207 per volume and the profit on subsequent printings was 3/5 per copy. Thus, by the end of 1835, George and John Crabbe had received 414£, the entire profit for the first 5,000 copies of Vols. I and VIII; plus 2/3 (⅔ of 3/5) per copy on an additional 4,416 copies of these volumes, amounting to £496/16/-; for a total payment of £910/16/-. Murray's profit was £1242. for the first 5,000 copies of the remaining six volumes, plus 3/5 per copy on 6,008 additional copies, amounting to £1026/7/4, plus 1/2 per copy on 4,416 additional copies of Vols. I and VIII, amounting to £257/12; for a total profit of £2525/19/4. From this must be deducted £400. paid to Lockhart, leaving £2125/19/4, which, although not coming close to equalling his profits from the Byron edition, was nevertheless a very considerable success and one which would be envied by any publisher.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Leigh Hunt, George Henry Lewes and Henry Hallam's Introduction to the Literature of Europe by William Baker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his often copious annotations found in most of the books with which he came in contact Leigh Hunt, intimate of most of the great literary figures of the Romantic and post-Romantic period, recorded his direct responses to the material before him. 1 George Henry Lewes was another inveterate maker of marginalia. 2 Leigh Hunt befriended the young and precocious Lewes and although their relationship eventually soured, largely as a result of the sexual proclivities of Hunt's son Thornton, while it lasted it was a deep one. 3 The copy of the four volumes of Henry Hallam's Introduction to the Literature of Europe, in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries (London, John Murray, 1837-39) now in the Lewes collection at the Dr. Williams's Library, London, 4 serves as a rich testament to Leigh Hunt's and G. H. Lewes's friendship and annotative practices. 5 The four volumes contain innumerable markings, well over one thousand in all, taking the form of underscorings, perpendicular lines, marginal exclamation marks, a marginal "q" representing question, and detailed comments. Largely the annotations are the work of two hands—Leigh Hunt and George Henry Lewes. On the fly-leaf of volume two in black ink is the note "The marks &amp; remarks signed L.H. in these volumes are those of Leigh Hunt." 6 Lewes's markings usually in blue or black ink are unsigned. Whilst the range of annotations in these four volumes is extensive their nature is different. Sometimes we shall find a correction or misprint: Hallam refers to "M. Sismondi" and to "his Litérature du Mudi" (I, 36). 7 In the left hand margin Lewes writes "Mide" and in the text places a pencil line through the misprint. In other instances additional footnote references are added: by Hallam's discussion of the early usage of parchment and the comment that its use was expensive and "gave rise to the unfortunate practice of erasing manuscripts in order to replace them with some new matter," G. H. Lewes underlines in pencil the words "erasing manuscripts" and "replace them with some new matter." In the right hand margin of the page he also notes in blue ink "see Notes to Robertson's Hist of Charles V" (I, 73). 8 At other times we find statements of opinion which often coincide, in Leigh Hunt's case, with those in his numerous critical essays and sometimes not. Occasionally they may suggest ideas for essays. Thus during his discussion of ninth-century writing Hallam comments that "the means of giving the air of more learning than was actually possessed" was achieved through the "use of some Greek words." Using blue ink in his left hand margin Leigh Hunt comments: The same thing occurs in our Old Dramatists who make a lavish display of their ignorance of foreign languages Shakspere included. A curious essay might be written on the History of Quotation. 9 I suppose this desire to appear more learned is founded on the same vanity as to appear more rich or more noble: an universal passion for "keeping up appearances" (I, 122). In the first volume there are approximately twenty-one main divisions of marginalia ranging from notes on Hallam's cyclical theory of cultural development and decline to those on Dante, and fifteenth-century Italian poetry, Ariosto, the Spanish poet Cortegiano of Castiglione, the philosophical realists and nominalists of the 1440-1500 period, and general literary criticism. There are also, as has been noted factual corrections, and miscellaneous comments. Those on Italian poetry focus upon Dante and the influences upon him. Hallam comments that "The subject of Dante is truly mediaeval, but his style, the clothing of poetry, bears the strongest marks of his acquaintance with antiquity." In pencil in the right hand margin Lewes notes (in the text he has underlined the words "Dante," and "marks of his acquaintance with antiquity"): Dante avowed Virgil to have been his master whom as Schlegel observes he excells in strength, concepts, depts &amp; [ ] indeed one is at a loss to know why Dante conferred such an honor on so incongenial a poet. Dante's mention of Horace &amp; Lucan in those high terms of commendation &amp; his placing himself beneath them is "proof of reverence" (I, 143). In his "The Roman Empire and Its Poets" ( Westminster Review , 38, 1842), Lewes divides poets into three classes. In the top category he puts Homer, Dante, Chaucer and Shakespeare. In the third group, Boileau and Pope, whilst the second group comprises Virgil, Milton, Tasso, Calderon, and Wordsworth (pp. 534-535). And in "Leigh Hunt on the Italian Poets," Foreign Quarterly Review , 36 (1846), Lewes using Schlegel's position that the great critic has flexibility, criticises Leigh Hunt's dislike of Dante. For Lewes, Hunt's views should be understood as representative of the age in which he lived. 10 In spite of the eighteen annotations signed "L. H." in volume one of Hallam, Hunt's markings are not evident in the passages discussing Dante. Certainly he disagreed with Lewes's assessment of Virgil. In his "Men and Books," New Monthly Magazine , 38 (January 1833), 48-59, Hunt refers to Horace and Virgil as "poet-inspired poets." That is those who use and respond to other poets and writings—a process Hunt believes used by the very greatest writers ( L.C. pp. 409-410). Hallam's comment on the lack of great Italian poetry during the 1440 to 1500 period draws a response from Lewes who in pencil underlines Hallam's "nature does not think fit to produce them" in the explanation "It is vain to seek a general cause for this sterility in the cultivation of Latin and Greek literature, which we know did not obstruct the brilliancy of Italian poetry in the next age. There is only one cause for the want of great men in any period;—nature does not think fit to produce them. They are no creatures of education and circumstances." This fundamental belief of Hallam is criticised in pencil in the left hand margin of his copy by Lewes who comments "This is but saying that they are not &amp; to defining this truism with the name of a cause can only be done by dragging in old nature as the solution of all possible problems" (I, 222). Ariosto, Amadis de Gaul , and Cortegiano of Castiglione also create annotative interest. By Hallam's statement "Ariosto has been, after Homer, the favourite poet of Europe" (I, 420), Hunt in blue ink in the left hand margin puts his "q" representing questionable. On the next page he questions Hallam's assertion that "Above sixty editions of the Orlando Furioso were published in the sixteenth century" by underlining "sixty" and in his right hand margin in bold blue ink placing two broad exclamation marks. His extensive marginal remarks are reserved for the sections on Amadis de Gaul and Castiglione. The former Romance was translated in French and in 1619 by Munday into English. Its "want of deep or permanent sympathy" must Hallam believes "alienate a reader of mature years" however "Amadis at least obtained the laurel at the hands of Cervantes." In black ink in his right hand margin and extending to the foot of the page following "alienate a reader of mature years" Leigh Hunt writes: Not me for one. I have read it through several times with great interest; though I have a grudge against the heroine. Amadis is as much a real gentleman as Don Quixote; &amp; some of the minor women are charming. Palmerin of England too still delights me with its fanciful dreaminess, its love of colour &amp; its bits of scenery. And I have a pleasant &amp; somewhat sly recollection of Twante the White , as of a weak &amp; sprightly girl whom one has half loved (I, 427). Similarly when Hallam finds the Cortegiano of Castiglione "A book that is serious without depth of thought or warmth of feeling cannot be read through with pleasure" Hunt disagrees. After the last sentence Hunt in pencil in the right hand margin places a "x" and at the foot of the page in pencil comments "But if it has the good sense &amp; [ ] elegance of Castiglione it can. At least I may answer for myself. . . . The book also contains many amusing anecdotes" (I, 548). There is evidence of other annotative hands at work in volume one. 11 Hallam at times reflects nationalist views. Talking of the period between 1400 to 1440 he notes that "the English language was slowly refining itself, and growing into general use." The "forced introduction of French words by Chaucer," and other contemporary influences, "has given English a copiousness and variety which perhaps no other language possesses." In pencil "copiousness" and "no other language" are underlined. The right hand margin contains an attack on this attitude: "On the contrary English is not admitted to be one of the richest of all familiar languages." In what to my eye seems to be G. Eliot's hand 12 she continues "The German is the richest of all from its excessive variety of possible combinations as well as possessing many thousand more original words than any other" (I, 171-172). 13 A further example of G. Eliot's pencilled annotation may be found on the next page. Hallam the sceptic advocates what Wellek in his "English Literary Historiography during the Nineteenth Century" (see Discriminations , 1970), refers to as "the alternative theory of cyclical progress. . . . Progress in literature, though genuine, is accomplished only in leaps and jerks or in an undulating way, with relapses and retrogressions" (p. 147). For Hallam "taking Europe generally, far from being in a more advanced stage of learning at the beginning of the fifteenth century than two hundred years before, she had, in many respects, gone backwards." G. Eliot in pencil underlines "taking Europe generally," "fifteenth," "two hundred years before" and "gone backwards." Hallam's continuation is also underlined by her. "There is, in fact, no security, as far as the past history of mankind assures us, that any nation will be uniformly progressive in science, arts, and letters; nor do I perceive, whatever may be the current language, that we can expect this with much greater confidence of the whole civilised world." In the right hand margin G. Eliot is slightly more optimistic and melioristic: "But in the past History of Man there is to be taken into consideration the invention of Printing which has for ever [saved] us from a relapse such as the Middle Ages" (I, 173). 14 Of philosophers and philosophical systems discussed in this first section Hallam's comments on the realist and nominalist controversy of the 1440 to 1500 period, on Averroism, and Ficinus, attract marginal attention. The whole of Hallam's chapter III, paragraph 86 explanation of "a doctrine first held by Averroes; that there is one common intelligence, active, immortal, indivisible, unconnected with matter . . . but which yet assists in the rational operation of each man's personal soul" receives a marginal vertical line. At the end of the paragraph G. Eliot notes in pencil "See Bayle-Averroes note E"—a somewhat curious reference which must remain for the time being obscure. 15 By the end of the next paragraph on Ficinus, an opponent of the Averroists, Lewes's marginalia is again in evidence. Hallam's comment that Ficinus' "own treatise, of which a very copious account will be found in Buhle, soon fell into oblivion; but it belongs to a class of literature, which, in all its extension, has, full as much as any other, engaged the human mind" elicites in the right hand margin his note "Far greater than any other Metaphysical speculations reigned almost universally Paramount till the time of Bacon" (I, 275). Lewes cannot refrain from directly contradicting Hallam's explanation of the nature of the Realist-Nominalist controversies. According to Hallam the former represented by "Plato and Aristotle, maintained their objective or external reality, either, as it was called, ante rem , as eternal archetypes in the Divine Intelligence, or in re , as forms inherent in matter." The Nominalists "with Zeno, gave them only a subjective existence as ideas conceived by the mind, and have hence in later times acquired the name of Conceptualists." In pencil Lewes underlines "and Aristotle" and in the right hand margin writes "no: Aristotle maintained precisely the contrary" (I, 253). Two additional notations in the first volume attract attention. The first exhibits Lewes's sense of humour, the second his sense of pathos. By Hallam's mention of Erasmus' meeting with Sir Thomas More "who could not then have been eighteen years old" Lewes adds the anecdote: "Who subsequently told him that his name betrayed his original state of Being on the theory of Metempsychosis for said he Thou wert a Mouse Eras-mus." (I, 323). The story of Lady Jane Grey is a sad one. Hallam writes that "Every one knows the behaviour of Lady Jane Grey's parents towards their accomplished and admirable child; the slave of their temper in her brief life, the victim of their ambition in death." Partially underlined in pencil is the word "temper" and in pencil in the left hand margin Lewes writes "And her own (poor soul!)" (I, 554). There are over 200 different kinds of linings in this first volume not to mention detailed pencilled lists of subjects on the flyleaf and the end back papers of the volume. In the next volume the annotations are much more detailed and extensive and extend over a wider range of material. Annotations are provoked by material on music, the Reformation and Religion, Iberian, Italian, Elizabethan and Shakespearian literature. The most extensive marginalia in volume two relate to early Elizabethan writers, general comments on Elizabethan literature and Shakespeare. Hunt often disagrees with Hallam on points of detail. For instance when Hallam writes "Sackville is far above the frigid elegance of Surrey" in pencil he underlines "igi" and "ele" of "frigid elegance" and in the right hand margin registers his disagreement: "A mistake. See his lines on a mother thinking of her son at sea" (II, 305). 16 Similarly Hallam's comment on Sidney's Astrophel and Stella that "it is not a work of genius" cannot escape Leigh Hunt's pen. He underlines "it is not a work of" and comments "It is : but of a tender &amp; delicate [grooming] wielding too large a [subject]" (II, 312-313). Hallam is more sympathetic to the Arcadia which "displays a superior mind, rather complying with a temporary taste than affected by it, and many pleasing passages occur, especially in the tender and innocent loves of Pyrocles and Philocles." This time G. H. Lewes rather than Hunt observes in pencil in the left hand margin aside this passage: "I have read it with delight myself &amp; know others who have done so, I never met with a woman who had read it &amp; was not fond of it" (II, 440). Hunt too has his moments of agreement with Henry Hallam for whom "the best of" the early Elizabethan writers "like Reginald Scot, express their meaning well, but with no attempt at a rhythmical structure or figurative language." The remainder of Hallam's point Leigh Hunt marginally lines in his right hand margin in blue ink and adds "Very good distinction." Hallam's passage reads: "they are not bad writers, because their solid sense is aptly conveyed to the mind, but they are not good, because they have little selection of words, and give no pleasure by means of style" (II, 407). Edmund Spenser was one of Leigh Hunt's favourite poets. "He constantly" quotes Spenser "in his essays" or makes "admiring allusions to him," and "through his lifelong devotion to Spenser, Hunt helped to foster the romantic enthusiasm for Elizabethan literature" ( L.C. p. 678, fn. 1). Hallam's exuberant praise of Spenser is marginally matched and capped by Hunt's. Thus Hallam's slight criticism of Spenser—"His versification is in many passages beautifully harmonious; but he has frequently permitted himself, whether for the sake of variety, or from some other cause, to baulk the ear in the conclusion of a stanza"—receives Leigh Hunt's black ink left hand marginal defense "Where? It was a delicacy of music" (II, 328). Again Hallam's view that Spenser is unable to maintain the purple passages of the early books of The Faery Queen and that "There is perhaps less reason than some have imagined, to regret that Spenser did not complete his original design" receives in the right hand margin a pained "Oh! Oh!" Leigh Hunt's right hand marginal rejoinder to Hallam's objection to the length of Spenser's poetry is "Immensely abroad. He thinks we are to read it all at once ! Who thinks of travelling through Arcadia all at once? The thing is, to loiter &amp; to return, &amp; perpetually return: to live in it all your life" (II, 329). Hallam's method is comparative. He weighs and balances Spenser with the Orlando Furioso , Ovid, Tasso and others. Spenser's and Ariosto's allegories "are each in the spirit of" their age, "but the one was for Italy in the days of Leo, the other for England under Elizabeth, before, though but just before, the severity of the Reformation had been softened away." Hallam adds "The lay of Britomart, in twelve cantos, in praise of chastity, would have been received with a smile at the court of Ferrara, which would have had almost as little sympathy with the justice of Arthegal." Such an analogy ignores a crucial element in Spenser. Hunt writes in the left hand margin, extending himself to the foot of the page: "But there is a great deal of voluptuousness in Spenser; &amp; his love of it is quite as great as that of chastity, &amp; a little more sincere" (II, 330). Hallam objects to those images of Spenser, which he suspects have an Ovidian influence, as being "hideous as well as untrue" (II, 331). Among the examples he gives are Cantos 8 and 9 from the first book of the Faery Queen , commenting that "Every one knows . . . a natural forest never contains such a variety of species; nor indeed could such a medley as Spenser, treading in the steps of Ovid, has brought together from all soils and climates, exist long if planted by the hands of man." Such "Leavisite" strictures receive Leigh Hunt's left hand marginally black ink double exclamation marks followed by the comment "In Fairyland." Hallam attacks "the celebrated stanza" in the final canto (71) of the second book of the Faery Queen on the same grounds. In this stanza "winds, waves, birds, voices, and musical instruments are supposed to conspire in one harmony" (II, 332). Hallam cites Twining in his translation of Aristotle's Poetics on this—"to a person listening to a concert of voices and instruments, the interruption of singing birds, winds, and waterfalls, would be little better than the torment of Hogarth's enraged musician" (Twining p. 14). 17 Hunt interacts with such a criticism by replying in his left hand margin "Yes, but not the inter-change of inter-communication" (II, 332). Spenser is placed by Henry Hallam in his league of great poets above Ariosto and Tasso. He believes that following Shakespeare and Milton Spenser "is still the third name in the poetical literature of our country, and that he has not been surpassed, except by Dante, in any other." Hallam then adds that "If we place Tasso and Spenser apart, the English poetry of Elizabeth's reign will certainly not enter into competition with that of the corresponding" Italian period. Hunt objects to this by underlining "If" and in the left hand margin asking two questions: "But why the 'if'? and what becomes of Shakspere?" In the footnote appended to these passages Hallam cites Thomas Campbell's assessment of Spenser in his Specimens of the British Poets as "discriminating and in general sound." For Campbell Spenser in his descriptive passages "exhibits nothing of the brief strokes and robust power, which characterise the very greatest poets." Hunt underlines "th" of "nothing" and places two exclamation marks in his left hand margin. Campbell continues "but we shall nowhere find more airy and expansive images of visionary things, a sweeter tone of sentiment, or a finer flush in the colours of language, than in this Rubens of English poetry." Leigh Hunt underlines "Rubens" and in the right hand margin in an annotation, which is now slightly cropped by rebinding of the volume, quips "!! He has far more grace &amp; beauty than Rubens" (Hallam, II, 334, citing Campbell Specimens of the British Poets [1819] I, 125). Hallam's discussion of Shakespeare extends over two volumes: the sixteenth-century Shakespeare in the second volume; the post-1600 Shakespeare in the third volume. Shakespeare's name is "the greatest in our literature—it is the greatest in all literature. No man ever came near him in the creative powers of the mind" (III, 574). In the second volume Hallam's comments on A Midsummer Night's Dream , Romeo and Juliet , and As You Like It draw Hunt's and Lewes's attention. Whilst "perhaps no play of Shakspere has fewer blemishes" than the Midsummer Night's Dream (II, 388) it still exhibits some instances to support the contention that Shakespeare "possessed rather more acquaintance with the Latin language than many believe." Hallam gives as examples of "Latinisms": "things base and vile, holding no quantity ," the last word standing "for value"; and "rivers, that 'have overborn their continents ," the continente ripa of Horace." In his right hand margin, aside these illustrations, in black ink, Leigh Hunt comments "But he , Shakspere, might have got at these words by profoundly looking &amp; inquiring into their meanings with the help of a very little Dictionary Scholarship." Beneath Lewes responds, "True but whence the necessity of this 'might' when other facts tend to support his classical knowledge?" (II, 389). Hallam objects to these lines as artificial and he finds fault also with the language of Romeo and Juliet : "the tone of Romeo is that of the most bombastic commonplace of gallantry"; and "The voice of virgin love has been counterfeited by the authors of many fictions. I know none who have thought the style of Juliet would represent it." In the first comment Hunt underlines "most bombastic commonplace of" and in the right hand margin exclaims "Oh! Oh! and forty times Oh!" The second observation receives a flat contradiction. Leigh Hunt writes: "I do; if the origin had ardour &amp; imagination. It is animal passion I allow; but of the truest Southern kind" (II, 393). The last comment on Shakespeare in this volume which arouses marginal interest concerns As You Like It . Hallam uses Coleridge's comment on Shakespeare's early poems in his Biographia Literaria (1817), "the creative power and the intellectual energy wrestle as in a war embrace" (ch. 15) to describe the play. Leigh Hunt underlines "war" and in his right hand margin writes "Love? They are not antagonists, but godlike playmates" (II, 397). If Hallam's footnotes are a reliable guide, the literary source of his interest in Iberian, Italian and Spanish literature is to be found in Schlegel, Bouterwek, Sismondi, and nearer home, Robert Southey. The Iberian certainly attracted Hunt and Lewes whose 1846 The Spanish Drama Lope de Vega and Calderon exhibits his wide reading in the field. From the evidence of the annotations on the subject in the second volume of Introduction to the Literature of Europe Hallam and Hunt must be an important source for Lewes's interest in the subject. Hallam's account of the sixteenth-century Portuguese epic, Camoens' poem the Lusiad and its English translation, 18 attracts Hunt's and Lewes's annotative attention. Southey's Quarterly Review essay on Mickle's translation is cited at length in a footnote by Hallam. For Southey "there is a magic of words as untranslatable as the Sesame in the Arabian tale,—you may retain the meaning, but if the words be changed the spell is lost. The magic has its effect only upon those to whom the language is as familiar as their mother tongue." Southey refines this point more clearly "hardly indeed upon any but those to whom it is really such. Camoens possesses it in perfection, it is peculiar excellence," ( Quarterly Review , 27 [1821], 38). In his right hand margin Lewes in pencil marginally lines this footnote and agrees with Southey by commenting "I take this to be sp[l]endidly true" (II, 287). Hunt's interest is aroused by Hallam's comment that "the most celebrated passage in the Lusiad is that wherein the Spirit of the Cape, rising in the midst of his stormy seas, threatens the daring adventurer that violates their unploughed waters." For Hallam the spirit of the Cape's speech is "feeble and prolix . . . the awful vision answers no purpose but that of ornament, and is impotent against the success and glory of the navigators." After this Hunt places an asterisk and at the foot of the page in pencil disagrees: "But is not that its very beauty? Did not the poet mean to paint the [great but] imaginery terrors of the Cape? imaginery at least before heroism &amp; perseverance" (II, 287-288). Of Spanish late sixteenth-century dramatists Lope de Vega is the "most renowned" and comparable to Shakespeare. He also is, as Cervantes has pointed out, "'a prodigy of nature." With such praise Leigh Hunt is in accord commenting in his right hand margin in thick black ink: "Good. Particularly to me at any rate, if not so in fact." Accounts of Lope de Vega's alleged productivity naturally attract Leigh Hunt—also a far from lazy writer. Apparently de Vega's "astonishing facility enabled him to supply the Spanish theatre with upwards of 2000 original dramas, of which not more than 300 have been preserved by printing." Further, de Vega required not more than twenty-four hours to compose one of his verse dramas. Hunt's comment is "Typography wants a new note of admiration to express one's astonishment at Lope de Vega" (II, 353). This "peculiar gift of rapid composition" Hallam writes appears "more extraordinary when we attend to the nature of Lope's versification, very unlike the irregular lines of our old drama, which it is not perhaps difficult for a practised hand to write or utter extemporaneously." Not surprisingly Hunt asks in the margin "Which are they?" (II, 354). He reserves two exclamation marks surrounded by two vertical black ink lines and a "√" of approval in the right hand margin for Hallam's quip that "some of the Italian improvisatori . . . have been said to carry on at the same time three independent sonnets, uttering, in their unpremeditated strains, a line of each in alternate succession. There is reason to believe, that their extemporaneous poetry is as good as anything in Lope de Vega" (II, 355). Compared with such obvious relish for these Paganini virtuosi performance, Lewes's right hand marginal pencil "Bravissimo" by Hallam's note that Cervantes' Numancia in which "there is a moral power, for the sake of which the sufferings of sympathy must not be flinched from" (II, 363), seems dull in comparison. The third volume published in 1839 with, on its title page, the underlined blue ink signature of "G. H. Lewes 1840," has also extensive marginalia. Subjects attracting attention range from Bacon, Hobbes and J. S. Mill, Descartes and Astrée, Cervantes and Calderon to Shakespeare and English early seventeenth-century poetry and drama. Hallam's extensive section on Shakespeare ranging from discussion of the Falstaff of The Merry Wives , through Measure for Measure , Lear , and Timon receives only G. H. Lewes's and not Leigh Hunt's marginal linings and markings rather than annotative comments. Where Lewes shows signs of disagreement with Hallam is with his general comments on Shakespeare as a comic dramatist. The Merry Wives receives high praise: "in wit and humorous detail no other" play "goes beyond it." Lewes in the left hand margin places a "q" (III, 562). Again when Hallam regards Shakespeare as vastly superior to Ben Jonson Lewes puts a "q" in his right hand margin. He does this too when Hallam refers to the "brilliancy of the wit" of the Merry Wives —in addition Lewes underlines Hallam's words (III, 563). His marginal linings and squibbles, III, 564-565, do seem to note approval of the praise accorded Measure for Measure . In a similar manner he scores passages on Shakespearian idolatry and reflections upon the bard's diction (III, 576-577). The most extensive marginalia in the volume are reserved for Hallam's strictures on Calderon and Cervantes. It is with reference to Calderon that Hallam generally, in the words of René Welleck in the "Preface" of his 1970 Johnson Reprint Corporation edition of Hallam, "rejects the extreme consequences of consistent historicism" (p. xv). 19 For Hallam "It will not convert bad writing into good to tell us, as is perpetually done, that we must place ourselves in the author's position, and make allowances for the taste of his age, or the temper of his nation." Lewes fundamentally disagrees with such a notion. In blue ink in his right margin, following his marginal lining of the passage, Lewes exclaims "Oh! Oh! Oh!" and continues "Calderon then should have written not for his age, but for this? It was because he made so lasting an impression on his age that this takes the trouble of looking at him" (III, 539). 20 Hallam's assessment of Cervantes also comes in for Lewes's serious reservations. For Hallam "Don Quixote is the only book in the Spanish Language" written during the 1600 to 1650 period "which can now be said to possess much of an European reputation. It has, however, enjoyed enough to compensate for the neglect of all the rest." In black ink in the left hand margin Lewes scrawls "Pooh! Calderon, Lope de Vega, Mariana Vese" (III, 666). Lewes makes several marginal lines by Hallam's account of Don Quixote (see III, 669, paragraph 46). Hallam takes issue with Sismondi and Bouterwek who believe that Don Quixote "a perfect man . . . is nevertheless the constant object of ridicule" (III, 668), and that "The fundamental idea of Don Quixote is the eternal contrast between the spirit of poetry and that of prose." This view "gliding too much into refinement and conjectured hypothesis" leads to "mere paradox and absurdity" (III, 667). Don Quixote is simply a comic lunatic. Hallam writes "I must . . . venture to think as, I believe, the world has generally thought for two centuries, that Cervantes had no more profound aim than he proposes to the reader." Hallam's next sentence provokes Lewes, beginning in the left hand margin and extending over to the foot of the next but one page, in grey ink to lengthy marginal comment. Hallam writes "If the fashion of reading bad romances of chivalry perverted the taste of his contemporaries, and rendered their language ridiculous, it was natural that a zealous lover of good literature should expose this folly to the world by exaggerating its effects on a fictitious personage." Lewes underlines "reading bad romances of chivalry perverted . . . taste of his contemporaries, and rendered their language ridiculous" and "of good literature should expose this folly." In the margin he writes: All this reasoning of Hallam's seems to me to be just like all the criticism throughout the work the very twaddle of commonsense —commonsense the boasted being about the worst possible criterion for any work without its own peculiar sphere. I think Bouterwek right &amp; Hallam wrong from various reasons, internal &amp; external. To suppose the object of Cervantes to have been to ridicule chivalry , as is so often asserted, is the veriest absurdity since chivalry was no longer extant in his time except in books—as it is more extant in Scott's novels. To suppose he devoted this great work written at such infinite pains, to the exposure of bad romances as Hallam asserts is too neat a [672] demand on our credulity for I. A new era of Spanish Literature had sprung up—classic taste—&amp; style were become indispensable in a writer &amp; consequently these foolish Romances were only read by the less intelligent; &amp; among the uninformed there will always be abundance of trash of some sort. II. How does Don Quixotes madness ridicule Romance? To say they were the causes of his madness is only saying that he had a diseased brain &amp; would have gone mad from any other excitement. To say he shows the folly of attempting to realise Romance is quite [673] beside the question, since these Romances were ostensibly untrue—were known &amp; felt to be fictions by everyone out of his teens &amp; therefore could not have led [d] them to realise them. III Would such a mind as Cervantes had condescended thus to break butterflies on so immense a wheel? could he not have served all the purposes of ridicule in a little novella ? And was all his philosophy, poetry, enthusiasm &amp; sarcasm contained in these wondrous pages originated to crush ephemera which were dying of themselves? [674] Why Lewes should spend so much time disagreeing with Hallam and arguing that Don Quixote is a serious tragic hero remains open to conjecture. From the present evidence it does not seem that Lewes wrote an essay solely devoted to Cervantes. His "The Rise and Fall of the European Drama," Foreign Quarterly Review , 35 (1845) does mention Cervantes but only in the company of a host of other great dramatists. Hallam's commonsense debunking approach does draw out elements evident in much of Lewes's best literary criticism: his awareness of the artistic presuppositions of a different period and country from his own; Lewes's insistence upon the serious nature of genius, and his use of the criteria of realism. It is clear that Lewes has a high opinion of Cervantes. Hallam comments that "We have only to compare" Cervantes "with Le Sage or Fielding, to judge of his vast superiority." Aside this in his left hand margin Lewes writes "!!! Scott &amp; Cervantes!" When Hallam adds "To Scott indeed he must yield in the variety of his power; but in the line of comic romance, we should hardly think Scott his equal" Lewes underlines "hardly" and "Scott his equal" and writes "hardly think it!" 21 His final comment on this section of the Introduction to the Literature of Europe is concerned with exposing the subjective nature of its author's opinions. For Hallam Cervantes minor novels "are written . . . in a good style, but too short, and constructed with too little artifice to rivet our interest." The penultimate word is underlined and in the right hand margin Lewes notes "read ' my interest' They are charming &amp; all the world has found them so" (III, 674). Hallam's touchstone of commonsense leads him, when dealing with early seventeenth-century poetry, into some curious positions. As Kathleen Tillotson notes in her 'Donne's Poetry in the Nineteenth Century," ( Mid-Victorian studies , 1965), Hallam's "merely contemptuous tone" when speaking of Donne "is exceptional" (p. 289). For Hallam Donne is the most inharmonious of our versifiers, if he can be said to have deserved such a name by lines too rugged to seem metre. Of his earlier poems many are very licentious; the later are chiefly devout. Few are good for much; the concerts have not even the merit of being intelligible; it would perhaps be difficult to select three passages that we should care to read again. Nor does Hallam spare Crashaw. "It is difficult, in general," he writes "to find anything in Crashaw that bad taste has not deformed." (III, 493). Leigh Hunt, on the other hand, was an early Victorian admirer of Donne whose "Epithalamiums" he places next to the great Spenser's as "our best." Of Donne generally he comments in his essay "Epithalamiums Wedding-Days Vivia Perpetua ," British Miscellany (April 1841), that he was "a great wit and intellect, who is supposed, by some," and here it seems that Hunt has Hallam's passage in mind, "to be nothing but a bundle of conceits . . . . In occasional passages, they are even superior in depth and feeling" to Hunt's beloved Spenser—very high praise indeed from Hunt—"though the very audacity of their truthfulness (honest in that depth) hinders them from being quotable to the general ear?" ( L.C. pp. 497-498). It is not surprising then that when reading Hallam's harsh attack on Donne Hunt should respond. In the right hand margin in pencil (III, 493) he observes "He did it on purpose. It was the notion, in his day of satiric numbers" alongside Hallam's deprecatory remarks on Donne's "lines" being "too rugged to seem metre." Of the whole of Hallam's paragraph on Donne Hunt comments "!!! No sort of justice is done here to Donne." 22 Following Hallam's account of Crashaw, in the paragraph succeeding the one on Donne, Hunt similarly observes that "Expression was one of the forms of Crashaw. He is not justly treated" (III, 493). It is unfortunate that Hunt seems not to have righted the account and written on Crashaw whom he mentions briefly in his writings. 23 Another early Victorian admirer of John Donne was G. H. Lewes who borrowed Leigh Hunt's copy of Donne. In his "Retrospective Reviews—No. VIII," National Magazine and Monthly Critic (April 1838), Lewes cites some of Hunt's marginalia and speaks of "Honest John Donne—rough—hearty—pointed and sincere." The Good Morrow exhibits "the true language of passion" (cited Mid-Victorian Studies , p. 292). Hunt's sympathies also were nothing if not Catholic and they extend to Suckling and Herrick as well as to Donne. In his "On Poems of Impulse" of 15 March 1854 Hunt writes that "Herrick is remarkable for his spirit of enjoyment" although "Herrick did not always, or perhaps ever, hit the flesh and blood of the thing like Suckling" ( L.C. p. 545). Hunt had also a preference for Carew, whose figure he uses in his romantic novel Sir Ralph Esher (1832)—(see L. Landré, II, 348). It is consequently slightly surprising to find a lack of his annotations or markings beside Hallam's discussion of these Cavalier figures. Lewes's comments on Suckling and Herrick show however that some of his friend's enthusiasms had left their mark upon the younger man. Hallam says that "Sir John Suckling is acknowledged to have left far behind him all former writers of song in gaiety and ease." Furthermore "it is not equally clear that he has ever since been surpassed. His poetry aims at no higher praise; he shows no sentiment or imagination" (III, 509-510). It is with this last point that Hallam and his reader part company. Lewes underlines in pencil "no sentiment" and in his left hand margin writes "mistake" (III, 510). Hallam points to Herrick's poetry being somewhat sensuously wanting. For Hallam "Herrick has as much variety as the poetry of kisses can well have; but his love is in a very slight degree that of sentiment; or even any intense passion; his mistresses have little to recommend them, even in his own eyes, save their beauties." Lewes too responds to this lack in Herrick. In pencil he underlines "the poetry of kisses" and in the right hand margin comments "well expressed; but the remark is not true. Nobody has yet done justice to the 'poetry of kisses'; much less they who but write profusely [ word erased ] on the subject" (111, 511). On figures perhaps now relegated to the depths of obscure footnotes Lewes has some interesting marginal disagreements with Hallam. The latter finds Phineas Fletcher's The Purple Island "insuperably wearisome." This Lewes underlines and also in pencil in the left hand margin disagrees: "by no means. I [superated] it without any weariness at all; I desired more" (III, 486). Hallam finds that Gondibert whilst "very little read . . . is better worth reading than the Purple Island." To this Lewes remarks in pencil in the left hand margin "Eminently No !" (III, 500). And there is an interesting piece of footnote annotative literary critical debate during Hallam's discussion of Johnson's essay on the "Metaphysicals." In his footnote Hallam cites Denham's lines on the Thames O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream My bright example, as it is my theme:— Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull; Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. and Johnson's comments that "most of the words thus artfully opposed, are to be understood simply on one side of the comparison, and metaphorically on the other; and if there be any language which does not express intellectual operations by material images, into that language they cannot be translated." 24 This elicits Hallam's "But the ground of objection is, in fact, that the lines contain nothing but wit, and that wit which turns on a play of words." To which in his right hand margin in pencil Lewes comments "Surely not without corresponding thoughts" (III, 491). Lewes, Hunt, and Hallam, part company in their assessment of English drama during the 1600-50 period. Reviewing a performance of The Duchess of Malfi at Sadler's Wells on November 20 in the Leader (30 November 1850, p. 859), Lewes praises Webster's poetry yet finds the play a "motiveless and false exhibition of human nature." 25 Of course such a response might have been to a very bad production and performance rather than to the text of the play. Be that as it may, Hunt in his October 1842, Church of England Quarterly Review piece on Tennyson's poems, classes Webster with Beaumont and Fletcher and others as examples of "the genuine intermediate good stuff, whether of thought or feeling" ( L.C. p. 526) in literature. For Hallam "Webster . . . possessed very considerable powers, and ought to be ranked . . . the next below Ford." The last three words Hunt underlines in black ink and in the right hand margin boldly writes "Oh! Oh!" (III, 619). Unfortunately his comments on Ford are difficult to find—a reflection perhaps of his feelings about this writer? He has left us though in his annotations his general reaction to Hallam's sixth chapter of his third volume—the chapter is entitled "On the English Drama [1600 to 1650]." At its conclusion Hunt adds in grey ink: "Mr. Hallam either grudges, or does not see, the superiority of Hazlitt &amp; Lamb over such criticasters as Gifford. In either case he shews himself unequal to the subjects of this chapter." (III, 622). Hunt's reference is to William Gifford (1756-1826), editor of the Quarterly Review , whose opinions are continually cited in Hallam's chapter. But Hunt's preference for Hazlitt and Lamb may not be entirely a literary one. His personal dealings with Gifford were mixed and they mutually disliked each other. 26 Hallam, a wellknown Whig, frequently contributed to the Edinburgh Review , the rival of Gifford's Tory review, 27 which, according to Ian Jack, in 1828, two years after Gifford's death, published Southey's scathing Tory attack on Hallam's The Constitutional History of England , ( English Literature 1815-1832 , p. 537). Hallam's last years were deeply affected, as Leslie Stephen relates in his D.N.B. piece on Hallam, by the death of his son Arthur in 1833. Given the adverse hysterical Tory reviews of his last book in a journal closely associated with Gifford, and the cloud over his last years, it is curious that Hallam should place so much weight upon Gifford's opinions. 28 As with Shakespeare, Hallam's section on Milton extends across two volumes. There is a feeling when reading Hunt, Lewes and Hallam on Milton, that they are paying homage to an accepted genius rather than waxing with enthusiasm, as is clearly the case of Hunt with Spenser, or Lewes with Cervantes. Lewes's comments on Milton are sparse. In The Leader , June 22, 1850, he places Tennyson's In Memoriam above Milton's Lycidas in its expression of the depths of elegiac feeling. But is careful to add that this does not imply that Tennyson is in Milton's class (pp. 303-304). Hence by Hallam's comment that poems such as Lycidas "pretend to no credibility, they aim at no illusion; they are read with the willing abandonment of the imagination to a waking dream," Lewes in pencil in the left hand margin observes "The point is to be much better defended than this" (III, 514). He disagrees with Hallam's reservations about Warton's idea of Ovid's influence upon Milton: "Why Warton should have at once supposed Ovid to be Milton's favourite model in Hexameters, and yet so totally different, as he represents him to be, seems hard to say." To which Lewes replies in pencil in his left hand margin: "Was it not on account of a certain luxuriance &amp; a love of mythological allusion?" (III, 526). Milton's musical knowledge is one of his assets. Of Samson Agonistes Hallam notes: "Milton seems to have forgotten that the ancient chorus had a musical accompaniment." Lewes lines the passage and in his right hand margin in pencil writes: "no; it was precisely because he remembered this I take it; chamitz or recitative will explain it" (IV, 429). For Hallam Milton "describes visible things, and often with great powers of rendering them manifest, what the Greeks called εναξγεια, though seldom with so much circumstantial exactness of observation, as Spenser or Dante; but he feels music." Lewes underlines the Greek term and in pencil in the left hand margin notes "poetical phantasy?" (IV, 426). At one point Lewes corrects a point of Hallam's detail when he writes "Of his Latin poetry some was written at the age of seventeen; in English we have nothing" to which in pencil in the right hand margin Lewes adds that "A translation of [ ] (very fine) came earlier: [&amp; some] lines of change in the original language" (III, 511. 29 Hunt's hand is not present in these sections on Milton, but his comments on Milton, scattered throughout his writings, seem to be akin to Hallam's and Lewes's. In Imagination and Fancy he asserts that true lovers of the poet have a "secret preference for his minor poems" over Paradise Lost which has "a certain oppressiveness of ambition and conscious power" ( L.C. p. 23). In a letter of 14 February 1849 to Edmund Peel he admits "I have probably a tendency in me, notwithstanding all my admiration of him, not to do him entire justice." He gives his main reason as one, which is not introduced either by Hallam or Lewes, that is, he objects "to the derogatory notions which he appears to me to entertain of the Deity." Yet Milton "is a great and wonderful poet; and in other respects I reverence him afar off, and 'his skirts adore'" (cited L. Landré, II, 169). The Introduction to the Literature of Europe , is as much a history of ideas, as a history of literature. It is hardly surprising then that Lewes's attention in the third and fourth volumes should be drawn to Hallam's passages on Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, and Spinoza. Hunt is not primarily attracted by such thinkers. With the exception of a comment in his "Sketches of the living Poets: No. 4 Mr. Coleridge," Examiner , 21 October 1821, where he notes that "it might have been better for Lord Bacon had his being all for experiment not tempted him to take leave of sentiment and imagination in trying to raise his paltry worldly greatness," 30 Hunt seems to leave philosophers well alone—as he does in his marginalia. There is one noticeable instance where Hunt marginally indicates an element of dogmatism occasionally exhibited by Hallam despite his general stance of "anti doctrinaire empiricism." 31 Hallam writes that "I have somewhere read a profound remark of Wesley, that, considering the sagacity which many animals display, we cannot fix upon reason as the distinction between them and man: the true difference is, that we are formed to know God, and they are not." Underlined in pencil is "a profound remark" plus "and they are not." At the foot of the page Hunt asks "How does he know that? Did a jackass ever say to him, 'Sir, I have no conception of a God?'" (III, 161 fn). Hallam's assertion is in strong contrast to remarks elsewhere in the Introduction . In the final volume he writes "If man was made in the image of God, he was also made in the image of an ape" (IV, 51). Bacon is admired by Hallam and his account attracted Lewes who cites him as an authority on the subject of Bacon in his section on the philosopher in his A Biographical History of Philosophy . 32 Marginalia shows that Lewes whilst reading Hallam is creatively reacting to him. A seemingly trivial comment on Bacon—"it was by his hours of leisure, by time hardly missed from the laborious study and practice of the law and from the assiduities of a courtiers life, that he became the father of modern science"—is marginally marked in blue ink. In pencil Lewes notes "Comp. Des Cartes &amp; the University lives of others" (III, 167). This possibly was the starting point for similar observations in his own work. 33 He is not always in agreement with Hallam and his marginalia does reflect a change in emphasis from that in the Biographical History where he is anxious to show Bacon's originality. For Hallam Bacon "seems to place 'the platform or essence of good' in seeking the good of the whole, rather than that of the individual, applying this to refute the ancient theories as to the summum bonum." Lewes in pencil in his right hand margin scores this, places a "q" by it and makes a point omitted from his own published account: "But perhaps Bacon has not thoroughly disentangled this question, and confounds, as is not unusual, the summum bonum , or personal felicity, with the object of moral action, or commune bonum " (III, 191). In the Biographical History Lewes concentrates on Bacon's method in order to show his achievement in the "separation of science from theology," and he favourably cites Mill's System of Logic: Inductive and Ratiocinative to demonstrate Bacon's achievement in analysing Induction (pp. 371, 378-379). It is his distinguished philosophical contemporary whom he calls to his assistance when Hallam rarely has reservations about Bacon. Hallam objects to "the general obscurity of" Bacon's style, "neither himself nor his assistants" were "good masters of . . . Latin . . . which at the best is never flexible or copious enough for our philosophy." In his right hand margin Lewes cites John Stuart Mill: "He made it a noble philosophical language which it never was before" (III, 223). And seven pages later Mill is again cited. Hallam says that Bacon "laid down for his guidance a few fundamental rules of logic, such as to admit nothing as true which he did not clearly perceive." In his left hand margin Lewes quotes Mill: "&amp; to admit everything as true which he did clearly perceive or rather conceive" (III, 230). 34 Hallam disapproves of Hobbes as a crude materialist and defender of despotism. But, Lewes comments in his Biographical History , Hallam "has noticed the acuteness and originality which often characterize Hobbes's remarks" (p. 443). Many of these are marginally lined in Lewes's copy of the Introduction . (see Hallam, III, 284-285, 301). It is however Hallam's commentary on Lewes's beloved Spinoza which produce the richest and most detailed annotations in what is otherwise annotatively a spartially populated final volume of Hallam, (published in 1839). A further reason for Lewes's detailed attention to the Spinoza section of Hallam's work is that his account, plus Lewes's in the Penny Cyclopaedia , are the only ones on Spinoza that Lewes is aware of "in English, critical or explanatory." ( Biographical History , p. 437 fn.). Disagreement is clear from the outset. Hallam finds a "fundamental fallacy" in the four axioms of the first book of Spinoza's Ethics : "The knowledge of an effect depends on the knowledge of the cause, and includes it." To Hallam "the relation between a cause and effect is surely something different from our perfect comprehension of it." A comment which leads Lewes in the left hand margin to write in the blue ink, he uses throughout these Spinoza annotations, (some of these may be found, as indicated in fn. 4, in my annotated catalogue of The George Eliot-George Henry Lewes Library . Owing to a lack of space they are not reproduced in this article) "Here the Historian peeps feebly out &amp; shows himself no deep metaphysician, for he sees not that Spinoza does not mean that the relation of Cause &amp; Effect depends on our conception of them, but that a complete conception of the effect necessarily involves a complete conception of the cause" (IV, 246). A point which Lewes is at pains to make at length in his Biographical History (see pp. 424-426). There are occasions when Lewes praises Hallam. His account of the third part of the Ethics , on the passions, comes in for especial commendation, receiving Lewes's "Bravissimo!" (IV, 258). Such praise does not preclude Lewes from attacking Hallam soon afterwards. In a footnote Hallam cites "Cudworth's Treatise on Free-will . . . where the will and understanding are purposely, and, I think, very erroneously confounded" (the reference is to the 1838 edition). The words "purposely" and "very erroneously confounded" are underlined. In the left hand margin extending to the foot of the page Lewes quips—"Poor Hallam! Why did it not strike his modesty that on so subtle a point the agreement of two such intellects as Spinoza &amp; Cudworth was rather more efficient than any incompatibility of apprehension on his part?" (IV, 258). Hallam's commentary does give Lewes the opportunity to explicate Spinozistic ideas. He underlines Hallam's "considered under different attributes" and in the right hand margin scores his "The mind and body are but one thing, considered . . . attributes" and annotates "Extension is visible thought &amp; thought is invisible Extension" (IV, 259). Lewes's most extensive and impassioned comments are reserved for disagreement. During the conclusion of his Spinoza section Hallam criticises Spinoza whose metaphysical theory and moral system demonstrate "how an undeviating adherence to strict reasoning may lead a man of great acuteness and sincerity from the paths of truth." Marginally scored, this comment leads Lewes to exclaim in the left hand margin "Good God! What an assertion! A man who would seek truth must then occasionally reason inaccurately? but would not the end be better attained by always reasoning inaccurately?" For Henry Hallam "A few leading theorems, too hastily taken up as axiomatic, [underlined by Lewes] were sufficient to make" Spinoza "sacrifice, with no compromise or hesitation, not only" and Lewes underlines the rest of the sentence "every principle of religion and moral right, but the clear intuitive notions of common sense." After this there is a thick stroked ink line and in the right hand margin the comment "Ah! common sense! very common!" Lewes places also a "X" above the word "moral" and at the foot of the page (IV, 260) repeats it and writes: Hear how these men assume their notions as the only principle of religion &amp; moral right! Because he overturns their Pulpit—doctrines! Would it not have been wiser in the Critical Historian to have examined these "leading theorems too hastily taken up" etc., have refuted them on which the whole system rests rather than talking twaddle like the above &amp; shirking the difficulty by appeals to the [ ] [obsessions] of the reader. Spinoza's one "great error" was Hallam writes "to entertain too arrogant a notion of the human faculties, in which, by dint of his own subtle demonstrations, he pretended to show a capacity of adequately comprehending the nature of what he denominated God." Lewes underlines from "adequately" to the end of the sentence. In his right hand margin he makes his final annotation on Hallam's interpretation of Spinoza by writing "Never! See on the contrary p. 257 of this vol. Spinoza endeavoured to show the capacity of comprehending the existence but not the being of God" (IV, 261). The remainder of Lewes's markings have less substance and value than those on Spinoza. Hallam's comment, whilst discussing Racine's Iphigénie , that Euripides characterization "has been censured by Aristotle as inconsistent; her extreme distress at the first prospect of death being followed by an unusual display of courage" receives Lewes's right hand pencilled marginal addition "Very natural, &amp; frequent" (IV, 457). Hallam's judgment that "In point of diction, the Spanish Friar in its tragic scenes, &amp; All for Love, are certainly the best plays of Dryden" is followed by four right hand marginal pencilled "!!!!" 's (IV, 487). The footnote that "we can hardly think that Balzac was not gravely ironical in some of the strange hyperboles which Bouhours quotes from him" elicites Lewes's "It is amazing to me that anybody ever doubted it" (IV, 512). Two "!!" in the left hand margin are the response to the stricture that the dramas of the late Restoration period are not "less course in expression, or less impudent in their delineation of low debauchery, than those of the preceding period" (IV, 490). Finally, Hallam's low assessment of Evelyn provokes Lewes to write at the foot of the page "Evelyn (to say the worst of him; but it is as true as the best) was a moral prig, who went poking about everywhere for subjects to be shocked at" (IV, 532). The Introduction to the Literature of Europe, in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries contains the considered distillations of a long life of reading and reflection by a man of letters who in the words of Leslie Stephen "commands respect by his honest, accuracy, and masculine common sense in regard to all topics within his range." ( D.N.B. VIII, 981). Upwards of a thousand or more markings in the four volumes by G. H. Lewes and Leigh Hunt clearly demonstrate the assiduity of attention, which Hallam commanded by his contemporary Hunt, and the representative of the succeeding generation, Lewes. Their annotations, of which only a selection has been presented, extend over the whole range of Hallam's reflective reading and provide in addition to having their own undoubted intrinsic interest, an indicator to the tastes of the 1840's and the post-Romantic, early Victorian period. If Hallam is the representative Whig gentleman scholar and "the magistrate of history," 35 Leigh Hunt who also spanned several generations—born like Hallam in the last decades of the eighteenth century and dying in the same year 1859—is the last survivor of the Romantic generation. Dickens may have been less than fair to him when he characterized him as Skimpole in Bleak House , yet for Saintsbury he "left a very large range of critical performance, which is very rarely without taste, acuteness, and felicity of expression." 36 Lewes, another inveterate devourer of books and annotator, is one of the leading critical figures of the mid-nineteenth century. Hunt's and Lewes's interaction to Hallam, reflected as we have seen in their extensive reading of the Introduction to the Literature of Europe , serves then as a valuable guide to their ideas on individual writers. As evidence of instances of taste such marginalia can do nothing but illuminate our knowledge of critical opinion in the mid-century on writers as varied as Dante, Ariosto, Sackville, Surrey, Spenser, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Donne, Crashaw, Evelyn, not to mention Bacon, Hobbes, and Spinoza amongst a host of others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Leigh Hunt's marginalia has not gone unnoticed. For accounts see especially L. A. Brewer's Marginalia (1926), My Leigh Hunt Library (1932), and More Marginalia ed., A. F. Trams (1931), W. J. Burke's "Leigh Hunt's Marginalia," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 37 (February 1933), 87-107, reprints Hunt's marginalia in his copy of J. C. L. de Sismondi's Historical View of the Literature of the South of Europe and has a check-list of seventy-five works in which Hunt's marginalia may be found. Of more recent studies, F. H. Ristine, "Leigh Hunt's Horace ," M.L.N. , 66 (1951), 540-543, and W. B. Todd, "Leigh Hunt's Annotations in Johnson's Dictionary ," Modern Philology , 73 (May 1976)—"a supplement to honor Arthur Friedman," S110-S112, concentrate on Hunt's marginal responses to specific authors and not, as is the case with the present study, on his reactions to various writers from differing periods. 2 Lewes's marginal mania has largely been neglected. See my "G. H. Lewes's Annotations to Coleridge's The Friend (1837)," The Library , 31 (March 1976), 31-36. 3 For Lewes's relationship with the Hunts see A. T. Kitchell, George Lewes and George Eliot (1933), pp. 11-16, 150, and Gordon S. Haight, George Eliot: A Biography (1968), pp. 131-132. For a good general account of Leigh Hunt, his life and opinions, see K. N. Cameron, Shelley and his Circle 1773-1822 (1961- ), I, 261-275. 4 Shelved at B.2. 35-38. Item 927 of my The George Eliot-George Henry Lewes Library: an annotated catalogue of their books at Dr. Williams's Library London (1977) records the presence of notations in some of the volumes. Lewes's annotations on Hallam's interpretation of Spinoza, volume IV, 251-254 are cited without comment. Plate V of the catalogue reproduces annotations in Hallam volume I, 427, and IV, 251. 5 L. A. Brewer's description of Hunt's reading habits also fits Lewes's: "It was his custom, evidently, to read with pen in hand and to mark passages that appealed to him because of one thing or another. These markings at times took the form of underscorings; frequently a perpendicular line was drawn down the page; a "q" was placed in the margin; and again a check mark, "√" was used by him." Marginalia , p. 29. When reproducing the marginalia in the Hallam volumes, material which I have been unable to decipher is represented by [ ]. The precise dating of these annotations presents problems. It is unlikely that any of them were made prior to 1837 when Murray published the first volume. The first title page has Lewes's "1837" dating, the second volume, (published in 1839), his "June 1840" dating. The third and fourth volumes were also published in 1839. The former has Lewes's "1840" dating. But it cannot be assumed that Lewes read the volumes at these dates. His friendship with Hunt, who got crustier as he grew older, and rarely mentions Lewes in his letters, could have lasted till the 1850-51 break with his wife Agnes over her relationships with Thornton Hunt. In the Leader for July 6, 1850 he praises Leigh Hunt highly (cited Kitchel, p. 150). Lewes in a 1846 Foreign Quarterly Review essay "Leigh Hunt on the Italian Poets" criticizes Hunt's view on Dante and writes that Hunt "judges works absolutely; the effect they produce on him is taken as a test of their excellence" (vol. 36, p. 338; cited A. R. Kaminsky, Gorge Henry Lewes as Literary Critic [1969] p. 28). This could have been written during a periodical turbulent point in their relationship. Lewes's concentration in his marginalia with Iberian literature and philosophy does point towards a pre-1846 date— Lewes's work in these areas appeared in 1846. One of the contemporaries Lewes cites in his marginalia, is John Stuart Mill, with whom he seems to have been most preoccupied with in the early 1840's. Lewes's citation in the third volume of Hallam p. 253 from Mill's A System of Logic , published in March 1843, points to the probability that he wrote that particular annotation after that date. 6 When describing Hunt's marginalia his "L. H." signature, characteristically following his annotations, has been omitted. 7 Citations in this form refer to volume and page number in the Dr. Williams's copy of Hallam. 8 Lewes's reference is to William Robertson's The History of the reign of the Emperor Charles V , first published in 1769, and which went through various editions. Hallam's omission is a surprising one. 9 Hunt seems not to have written such an essay. 10 Cf. fn. 5 above: for Hunt on Dante see C. D. Thorpe, "Leigh Hunt as Man of Letters," in Leigh Hunt's Literary Criticism , ed., L. H. Houtchens, C. W. Houtchens, pp. 23-24. This volume is henceforth referred to as L.C. 11 George Eliot's and Captain John Willim's. The latter, Lewes's step-father, scrawlings of content lists are found in the end back papers. The fly leaf has G. Eliot's pencilled list of 21 items of interest ranging from "Publication of translations &amp; parts of the Bible condemned p. 258" to "Atheism in the University of Padua p. 436." 12 For photographic examples of George Eliot's, Lewes's, Leigh Hunt's and Willim's hand see the reproductions in my The George Eliot-George Henry Lewes Library . 13 Of course George Eliot was steeped in German and one can be forgiven for sometimes feeling that the prolixity which occasionally infects her prose is due to her immersion in German a language which, as she comments in "German Wit: Heinrich Heine," Westminster Review , 55 (January 1856), "easily lands itself to all the purposes of poetry" and "generally appears awkward and unmanageable in the hands of prose writers" (cited Essays of George Eliot , ed. T. Pinney, [1963], p. 250, henceforth referred to as Pinney, Essays ). 14 In her "German Wit: Heinrich Heine" George Eliot comments that "A great deal of humour may co-exist with a great deal of barbarism, as we see in the Middle Ages." In her review of W. E. H. Lecky's History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe , Fortnightly Review , I (15 May 1865) she cites volume one, pp. 312, 320, of Hallam's Introduction —his section on Jean Bodin (see Pinney, Essays , 405). The Dr. Williams's copy shows no markings on these pages, nor does G. Eliot instance them in her fly leaf listing. I have not found references to Hallam's Introduction in the G. Eliot holograph notebooks that I have seen. 15 The form of G. Eliot's marginalia here is curious. The reference might possibly be to Pierre Bayle's Commentaire philosophique . . . ou Traité de la tolérance universelle . Rotterdam, 1713. (Dr. Williams's catalogue, item 156). Ernest Renan's Averroes et l'Averroism: essai historique was published in Paris in 1852. For G. Eliot's marked copy see Dr. Williams's catalogue, item 1792. Hallam (I, 274-275) is surprisingly sympathetic to Averroes metaphysical strictures on the soul: Emerson remarks in his "English Traits" (1856) that Hallam "is unconscious of the deep worth which lies in the mystics" ( The Complete Essays and Other Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson , ed., B. Atkinson, [1956], p. 653). This is, of course, not the case with George Eliot. 16 Probably a reference to stanza 12 in the induction to A Mirror for Magistrates , see R. Bell ed., The Annotated Edition of the English Poets , (1854) pp. 269-270. J. Haslewood's edition of Sackville appeared in 1815. 17 Thomas Twining's translation of Aristotle's Poetics with Twining's "'two dissertations, on poetical, and musical, imitation" was published in 1789. Hallam's reference is probably to Daniel Twining's two-volume second edition published by L. Hunnard and Sons in 1812. 18 Hallam's reference is to William Julius Mickle's translation of Os Lusiadas-The Lusiad ; or The Discovery of India . This first appeared in 1776 and by 1820 had gone through at least three editions. John Murray published in 1826 Thomas Moore Musgrave's translation of the same work. There is a copy of Luiz de Camoens Os Lusiadas , 2 vols., Avinhaŏ, 1818, in the Lewes collection at Dr. Williams's Library. The first volume has some of Lewes's linings, the second is unopened—see item 360. 19 I should like to thank Professor René Wellek for sending me an inscribed copy of his "Preface." 20 A. R. Kaminsky in her George Henry Lewes as Literary Critic discusses at some length Lewes's writings on Calderon and Lope de Vega, see pp. 163-166. 21 In his "Recent Novels," Fraser's Magazine , 35 (1847) Lewes placed Fielding's Tom Jones above the Waverly novels (p. 687), but in his "Historical Romance: The Foster Brother , and Whitehall ," Westminster Review , 45 (1846) he wrote that Scott "divined important historical truths which have escaped the sagacity of all historians" (p. 37). George Eliot's attitude to Scott is reflected in Lewes's inscription in the fly leaf of the first of the 48 volume set of the Waverly Novels he gave her: "To Marian Evans Lewes, The best of Novelists and Wives. These works of longest-venerated and best-loved Romancist are given by her grateful Husband 1 January 1860." Cited G. S. Haight, George Eliot A Biography . (1968), p. 319. 22 Louis Landré in his Leigh Hunt ( 1784-1859 ): 2 vols (1936), quotes a letter Hunt wrote to his friend Shelley on 20 September 1819: "Do you know Donne? I should like to have some more talk with you about him. He was one of those over-metaphysical-headed men, who can find out connections between everything and anything, and allowed himself at last to become a clergyman after he had (to my conviction, at least) been as free and deep a speculator in morals as yourself" (II, 168). Hunt does seem to have revised his opinion on Donne. 23 Reviewing Tennyson's Poems, chiefly Lyrical in the Tatler (March 1, 1831), Hunt writes that "Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind Not in Unity with Itself" is "a very striking" poem. "It is such as Crashaw might have written in a moment of scepticism, had he possessed vigour enough." Cited L.C. p. 352. Such evidence contrasted with marginalia tempts speculation that a shift in Hunt's attitudes to the Metaphysicals took place in the 1830's. 24 In Johnson's "Denham," Lives of the English Poets (1779-81).

      <field name="heading_text">The Uncertain Origins of Eugene O'Neill's "Bound East for Cardiff" by Paul D. Voelker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In May, 1914, during his first year of playwriting, Eugene O'Neill copyrighted three new plays. Of the three, only "Children of the Sea," a oneact play copyrighted on May 14, was to receive much more than the passing recognition accorded by the Library of Congress Copyright Office. Some two years later, in the summer of 1916, bearing the new title "Bound East for Cardiff" and having undergone further revisions, it achieved the distinction of being the first O'Neill play ever performed. Four months later, it became the first O'Neill play to open in New York City. At this time, "Cardiff" also first appeared in print, in Frank Shay's The Provincetown Plays, First Series . After that, it was printed in O'Neill's second published collection, The Moon of the Caribbees, and Six Other Plays of the Sea (1919). It has been continually available ever since. The fate of the original "Children of the Sea" was, of course, less spectacular; neither published nor performed during O'Neill's lifetime, it entered the public domain on May 14, 1942, but remained virtually unnoticed for another twenty years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since 1916, "Cardiff" has become an important play. Not only is it O'Neill's first produced play, but also, with its New York opening, "Cardiff" served to usher in a new period in the American theatre; moreover, that opening was the first of more than thirty O'Neill first nights to occur in New York during the next two decades. But "Cardiff" is also important because it has become the traditional benchmark of O'Neill's dawning maturity as an artist of the drama. It makes little difference which of the many books on O'Neill, critical or biographical, old or new, which one picks up. The judgment is virtually the same. Of the fifteen plays O'Neill is known to have written during his first two years of playwriting, "Cardiff" is considered to be, in the words of Barrett Clark, O'Neill's first biographer, "the one really mature play he [O'Neill] wrote in the 'prentice years . . ." ( Eugene O'Neill, The Man and His Plays , rev. ed. [1947, rpt. 1967], pp. 53-54). The more recent books on O'Neill have simply concurred in this judgment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In doing so, the critics and biographers have the clear warrant of O'Neill himself. In a letter to the critic Richard Dana Skinner, O'Neill noted of "Cardiff": "Very important from my point of view. In it can be seen, or felt, the germ of the spirit, life-attitude, etc., of all my more important future work" ( Eugene O'Neill, A Poet's Quest [1935; rpt. 1964], p. viii).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Given the importance of "Cardiff," it is somewhat surprising that the original "Children of the Sea" is so little known and that it has not received any special scholarly and critical analysis. Its virtual disappearance for almost fifty years is only partly responsible; in addition, there are the efforts of O'Neill himself and of his biographers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From 1916 on, O'Neill tended to be rather reticent about discussing his first plays. For example, in his letter to Skinner, O'Neill included, in Skinner's words, "a brief outline" of "the actual sequence in the writing of the plays . . ." (p. vii) which O'Neill had completed at that stage of his career. However, the list is incomplete where his first plays are concerned. For the fall and winter of 1913 and 1914, O'Neill listed only "The five one-act plays in 'Thirst'" (p. viii). (The reference is to his first published collection, Thirst, And Other One-Act Plays [1914].) But as subsequent investigation has revealed, previous to those five he wrote and copyrighted, but never published, another one-act play, "A Wife for a Life." About the spring and summer of 1914, O'Neill was even more misleading. He mentioned only "Cardiff." He did not refer to "Children" or to four other plays, two of them full length, which he also wrote and copyrighted during that period. The pattern is clear; he acknowledged none of the plays which had not been published.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O'Neill was somewhat more forthcoming with Barrett Clark; Clark, at least, was informed of the titles of the unpublished early plays. But if Clark knew that scripts for five of them had been copyrighted and had, in fact, entered the public domain in 1941 and 1942 before he published the 1947 revision of his book, he kept the information to himself and stated only that they had not "survived" or "were destroyed" (p. 49).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The situation changed with the publication of Lost Plays of Eugene O'Neill in 1950. This unauthorized volume of five early plays which had entered the public domain indicated that the Library of Congress housed a quantity of previously unknown O'Neill material. This knowledge was utilized by the second generation of O'Neill biographers, and Arthur and Barbara Gelb in O'Neill (1962; rev. ed. 1973) and Doris Alexander in The Tempering of Eugene O'Neill (1962) subsequently reported the existence of "Children of the Sea." But their comments were not an encouragement to further research. According to the Gelbs, when O'Neill revised "Children" into "Cardiff," he made "only minor changes" (p. 260), and according to Alexander "only slight changes" were made (p. 188). Similarly, O'Neill's third-generation biographer, Louis Sheaffer, in O'Neill: Son and Playwright (1968), noted only "slight revisions and a new title" (p. 278). Nevertheless, "Children" has finally been published, in Jennifer McCabe Atkinson's " Children of the Sea" and Three Other Unpublished Plays by Eugene O'Neill (1972). Consequently, it is now possible for anyone to make his or her own comparison of the latest version of "Children" and the first published version of "Cardiff"; but when this is done, the results are not precisely what one might expect, based on the reports of O'Neill's later biographers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The changes and revisions O'Neill made in "Children" which transformed it into "Cardiff" seem to be more than "slight" or "minor" ones. Not only did he revise individual lines of dialogue and stage directions, he also cut an entire page from his original twelve-page typescript. In addition, he rearranged the order of three key scenes. Finally, these and other changes suggest that he may ultimately have been trying to do more than simply polish the script of "Children," but may have been trying instead to modify significantly the focal point and thematic implications of the earlier version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The one-page cut is the most obvious difference between "Children" and "Cardiff." It consists of dialogue between the play's two main characters, the dying sailor Yank, whose death in his bunk from ship-board injuries is the climax of the play, and Yank's long-time friend and fellow seaman, Driscoll. The excised material contains a relatively long (some 350 words) speech by Driscoll and the dialogue between the two which precedes and follows it. Driscoll's long speech concerns an experience he had aboard another ship before he met Yank. As Driscoll tells it, conditions on board the ship were so bad that he was eventually led to murder the captain's mate by shoving him overboard (Atkinson, pp. 97-98; all subsequent page references to the text of "Children" will be to this edition). Driscoll's account is a powerful and moving confession; one must wonder why O'Neill chose to cut it, given that the entire one-act takes up barely seventeen pages in the published version (pp. 89-105).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An answer is suggested by noting the typical critical perception of "Cardiff" and by examining O'Neill's second major revision. Although Driscoll and Yank are clearly the two most important characters, Yank has traditionally been seen as the play's protagonist. In the words of one critic, Driscoll's "consoling, nostalgic speeches form a background for Yank's monologue" (Timo Tiusanen, O'Neill's Scenic Images [1968], p. 45). Given Driscoll's secondary importance to Yank, O'Neill may have felt that his account of the murder of the mate took away the spotlight from Yank for too long a time. By cutting Driscoll's account and the related dialogue, O'Neill gave further emphasis to Yank's death throes. The same seems to be the result of O'Neill's second major revision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another O'Neill critic has characterized Yank's death as follows: "Yank accepts the loneliness and the unknown terror [of death] with the affirmation of a brave man who has faced suffering before and is prepared to do so again. . . . Thus Yank celebrates life in his heroic response to death" (Doris V. Falk, Eugene O'Neill and the Tragic Tension [1958], p. 21). In "Cardiff," a major line of action is Yank's progress toward this heroic acceptance of death. Initially, Yank is unable even to pronounce the word—"D'yuh think I'm scared to—( He hesitates as if frightened by the word he is about to say. )." This line is quickly followed by evidence of Yank's fear of being left alone on his deathbed—"Don't leave me, Drisc! I'm dyin', I tell yuh" (p. 14; this and all subsequent page references are to the text of "Cardiff" in the first published edition, The Provincetown Plays, First Series ). Later, Yank repeats his plea— "No, no, don't leave me" (p. 17). Still later, however, Yank seems to overcome his fear—"I'm goin' to—( He hesitates for a second—then resolutely .) I'm goin' to die, that's what, and the sooner the better!" (p. 19). Taken together, these three lines seem to show a direct progression in Yank's attitude; but in "Children" the progression is not so obvious because Yank's second "don't leave me" (p. 102) occurs after his "I'm goin' to die, that's what" (p. 100). Thus, once again, O'Neill's revision seems to have increased the emphasis on Yank, this time by further emphasizing Yank's heroism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this point, one must wonder about O'Neill's underlying motivation for making both of these revisions. On the one hand, he may simply have been trying to bring into clearer focus his original intentions, but on the other hand, it is at least conceivable that these changes were the result of a change in O'Neill's original conception. Other revisions suggest that the latter may have been the case; they consist of alterations which modify the tone of the play and which, as a result, may indicate a shift in O'Neill's attitude toward both Yank and his relative importance. The first example concerns the revision of a stage direction. In the original "Children," Yank faints at one point, and Driscoll "gets a tin dipper of water from the bucket and throws it in Yank's face" (p. 95), but in "Cardiff" Driscoll " gets a tin dipper from the bucket, and bathes Yanks [sic] forehead with the water " (p. 15). (The published version of "Children" reflects O'Neill's practice of not underlining stage directions in his typescripts.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A similar shift in tone is apparent in O'Neill's cutting of the following passage near the end of "Children." (Those portions not found in "Cardiff" (p. 24) are in square brackets.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Driscoll—"But have ye no relations at all to call your own?" [Yank—"The old lady died when I was a kid, and the old man croaked when I was fourteen; the old booze got him. I've got two brothers but to hell with them! They're too respectable to want news of me dead or alive." Driscoll—"No aunts or uncles or cousins or anythin' the like av that?"] Yank—"No, not as I know of. One thing I forgot; You [sic] known Fanny the barmaid at the Red Stork in Cardiff?" Driscoll—"Who doesn't? [She's common property av the whole British merchan [sic] marine." Yank—"I don't care;] she's been good to me. She tried to loan me a crown when I was broke there last trip. Buy her the biggest box of candy yuh c'n find in Cardiff [before yuh divvy up my pay. If she don't like candy---" Driscoll—"A gallon of gin, I'm thinkin', wud be more welcome." Yank—"A gallon of gin, then! What's the difference as long as it's something she likes; and tell her it's with my regards."] (p. 104)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O'Neill's revision of the very end of the play seems similarly designed. At the end of both versions, Yank dies and Driscoll prays; then Cocky, another seaman, enters. In "Children," Cocky does not seem to realize that Yank has died and comments directly only on Driscoll.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cocky—(in blank amazement) "Prayin'! Gawd blimey!" (He slowly takes off his dripping sou'wester and stands scratching his head perplexedly as--- The Curtain Falls. (p. 105)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "Cardiff," the ending is as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cocky: ( Mockingly .) Sayin' 'is prayers! ( He catches sight of the still figure in the bunk and an expression of awed understanding comes over his face. He takes off his dripping sou'wester and stands scratching his head .) Cocky: ( In a hushed whisper .) Gawd blimey. CURTAIN. (p. 25)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All of these revisions seem to point to the same end, a softening of the coarser elements and a heightening of the softer ones, the net effect of which seems to be an overall more elegaic tone than is found in the original. When this result is seen in conjunction with O'Neill's apparent efforts to give Yank more emphasis, the possibility is raised that O'Neill had altered his original perception of Yank's role and, as a result, that his original conception of the play underwent a fundamental change. Because of this possibility, the importance of the differences between "Children" and "Cardiff" transcends the issue of whether the revisions were "slight" or "minor" ones. Given the admitted importance of "Cardiff" in O'Neill's arrival at artistic maturity, the issue becomes a question of how O'Neill actually arrived at that level of achievement, and it is here that the textual differences lead to a specifically bibliographic problem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the present time, it is not known when O'Neill made his revisions. The copyrighted typescript of "Children of the Sea," published by Atkinson, has been stamped by the Copyright Office with the date May 14, 1914. The first printing of "Bound East for Cardiff" occurred in November of 1916 (The Gelbs, p. 320). Thus, there is a gap of two and one-half years between the latest "Children" and the earliest "Cardiff" as far as the public record is concerned. Yet, within this period, a potentially crucial phase in O'Neill's development took place; during the 1914-1915 school year: he attended Prof. George Pierce Baker's famous course in playwriting at Harvard University. Traditionally, O'Neill's attendance in Baker's class has not been viewed as a significant factor in O'Neill's development as a dramatist; in fact, Baker has sometimes been charged with having a negative effect, most recently and in the strongest terms by Travis Bogard ( Contour in Time, The Plays of Eugene O'Neill [1972], pp. 48-62). A factor which has tended to support a negative view of Baker's influence is that O'Neill did not continue in the vein of his achievement in "Cardiff" until the winter of 1916-1917 when he wrote the three other one-act plays which, along with "Cardiff," comprise the series known as S. S. Glencairn ; but this line of reasoning is predicated on the assumption that "Cardiff" was completed in the spring of 1914 before O'Neill went to Harvard. The chronology of events which O'Neill presented in his letter to Skinner (p. viii) and in his conversations with Clark (p. 27) supports this assumption, and in both instances O'Neill stressed that "Cardiff" was completed before he went to Harvard. However, at the present time there is no documentary evidence to attest that, in fact, O'Neill revised "Children" sometime between May 14, 1914, and September, 1914, when he arrived in Cambridge. It is entirely possible that the revision took place either during or after O'Neill's year at Harvard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The textual differences between "Children" and "Cardiff" and their potential biographical import have led me to attempt to narrow the present two and one-half year gap. In this effort I have examined a photocopy of the "Bound East for Cardiff" manuscript which, along with several other manuscripts of early O'Neill plays, is the property of the Theatre and Music Collection of The Museum of the City of New York. (Here I wish to acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Donald Gallup, Curator of the Collection of American Literature, The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, for supplying me with a duplicate of the Yale copy of the "Cardiff" manuscript, and of Mr. Grenville Cuyler, Assistant Curator of the Museum's Theatre and Music Collection, for authenticating that my photocopy is, in fact, a duplicate of the manuscript.) My examination of the "Cardiff" manuscript has proven rather surprising. There is no doubt that the Museum manuscript is actually the original manuscript of "Children of the Sea" and that it antedates the typescript (a photocopy of which is also in my possession) at the Library of Congress. The so-called "Cardiff" manuscript can in no way serve to narrow the two and one-half year gap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That the Museum of the City of New York actually has the manuscript of "Children of the Sea" has not been previously known to O'Neill scholars, yet examination of it makes clear that it precedes the copyrighted typescript. Although there are some minor differences between the manuscript and the typescript, the two are substantially the same. Driscoll's account of the murder, the original order of the three key lines, and the other deletions noted above are also present in the Museum manuscript, and there is no indication that this material is to be cut or revised. The manuscript does contain some small revisions, however. Words are lined out and substitutes written above the line; arrows are drawn to indicate changes in position; but when the typescript is examined it is readily apparent that in it these indicated revisions have been accomplished. Thus, the Museum's manuscript seems clearly to antedate the typescript.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The manuscript itself consists of five leaves, written in pencil on both sides. Nowhere on these leaves is there either a title or a date. These are found only on one side of a sixth leaf—" 'Bound East for Cardiff' / (1914)." This leaf seems to be a later addition to the other five. In general, O'Neill's early manuscripts are written in pencil on rather poor quality paper. By contrast their title pages are paper of good quality. The "Cardiff" title page bears a watermark which shows up (illegibly) even in the photocopy. Even more striking, when the other five leaves, which lack watermarks, are examined, it is obvious that for a considerable length of time, they alone were fastened together with a paper clip. The clip eventually rusted and stained with its outline both sides of the first and last leaves, but the title page is completely unmarked by this discoloration. Consequently, the Museum manuscript provides no evidence that "Cardiff" was completed in the spring of 1914. What is apparent after an examination of the manuscript and the typescript of "Children of the Sea" is that O'Neill wrote the play, revised it, then typed it and, in the process, made further changes not found in the manuscript; but during this entire sequence, he did not contemplate the major changes discoverable in the first printing of "Cardiff."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Given that "Cardiff" was not published until some four months after its first production in the summer of 1916, it could be hypothesized that the changes resulted not from any shift in O'Neill's conception of the play, but from considerations which arose from seeing his very first play in rehearsal. From the time O'Neill began writing plays in 1913 up to his first performance in 1916, he hoped for and sought a production of one of them; nevertheless, during this period he wrote without the benefit of seeing any of his work on the stage. Hence it is conceivable that when he did for the first time, he found aspects of "Cardiff" which were not stageworthy and thus made the major revisions noted previously. However, documentary evidence exists which suggests that this sequence is not true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Berg Collection of American Literature of the New York Public Library has in its possession a partial script of "Cardiff" in the hand of George Cram Cook, the man who originated the role of Yank in the summer of 1916. The Cook manuscript consists of four leaves (which I have examined in photocopy). As a "part script" for the role of Yank, the document contains, on one side of each leaf, only Yank's lines and the related cue lines. (On the back of the fourth leaf are some sketches which appear to be of the floorplan for the set.) Despite this incompleteness, however, it is clear from textual analysis that, first, O'Neill made further changes in "Cardiff" before publishing it and, second, that he revised "Children" into "Cardiff" before Cook got his script. It is also clear that in the play Cook rehearsed, Driscoll's account of the murder did not appear and that the three key lines were already in their "Cardiff" order. The Cook leaves are undated, but it seems unlikely that they were made after the first performance of "Cardiff" or even after rehearsals had started. The logical time for such a script to be made is before the first rehearsal for the first production. If this assumption is valid, then it follows that O'Neill himself must have had a complete script of "Cardiff," either autograph or typewritten, from which Cook made his part script. The existence of such a genuine "Cardiff" manuscript is further reinforced by noting certain locutions which exist in neither version of "Children" nor in the first printing of "Cardiff." Since O'Neill did not make these revisions on the Museum's manuscript nor on the copyrighted typescript, he had to have, it seems, a third copy, perhaps a carbon of the typescript, on which to make his revisions. This third copy with its revisions would be in effect a genuine "Cardiff" manuscript. If it were located and if it were dated, the remaining two-year gap might be narrowed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been unable to locate such a document in any of the three major O'Neill manuscript repositories—The Museum of the City of New York, Princeton University Library, and the Beinicke Library at Yale. Moreover, I have either visited or corresponded with all libraries which have indicated, in American Literary Manuscripts, A Checklist of Holdings in Academic, Historical and Public Libraries in the United States (1960), the possession of either substantial O'Neill holdings and/or O'Neill manuscripts and, in each case, I have found no indication of a "Cardiff" manuscript or typescript which fits the requirements. At this time, a genuine "Cardiff" manuscript seems not to be a matter of record. That O'Neill donated to the Museum his "Children" manuscript further suggests that he did not possess a "Cardiff" manuscript and that one is no longer in existence. Yet, in the summer of 1916, it must have been.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the present time, there are only two pieces of evidence, both circumstantial, which serve to narrow the two-year gap, and both serve to place the revision in late 1915 or early 1916. First, there is the fact that O'Neill brought "Cardiff" to be produced in the summer of 1916. The Gelbs have noted that O'Neill was always most enthusiastic about his most recent work (p. 376). If he had just completed the revision of "Children," that would explain why he brought "Cardiff" rather than one of the other seven or eight plays known to have been completed after May of 1914. The second piece of evidence provides a motive for the revision. In August of 1915, O'Neill's personal friend, a real seaman named Driscoll, who served as a model for the two main characters of the play, committed suicide by jumping overboard in mid-ocean; O'Neill learned of Driscoll's death a few months later (Sheaffer, pp. 196 and 335). It seems reasonable to suggest that this news would have provided O'Neill with sufficient motivation to revise "Children" in ways which further emphasized Yank's heroism and heightened the elegaic tone of the play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For these and other reasons, the hypothesis is very attractive that "Cardiff" was completed sometime during the fall or winter of 1915-1916. This hypothesis also explains why O'Neill did not follow the line of "Cardiff" into the other Glencairn plays until the winter of 1916-1917, and it clarifies why the tone of "Cardiff" is consistent with those three plays, as noted by both Skinner (p. 38) and Clark (p. 58), but inconsistent with the irony of the other plays from 1914. The only difficulty is O'Neill's recurrent testimony that "Cardiff" was completed before he went to Harvard, but this difficulty is not insurmountable. O'Neill's comment to Skinner on the importance of "Cardiff" concerns the play's "life-attitude" not its construction, the only aspect with which Prof. Baker would have been concerned. If O'Neill stuck to the 1914 dating for "Cardiff," he could easily forestall any criticism that Baker had had a significant influence on his first important play when, in fact, Baker had not influenced the "spirit" at all. Given, as Louis Sheaffer suggests, that O'Neill was not averse to "mingling fiction with fact" (p. 239) where his autobiography was concerned, it is conceivable that he maintained a 1914 date for "Cardiff" simply to avoid the issue of how much Baker had influenced the play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If "Cardiff" were assigned a later completion date, this would also explain why O'Neill told Barrett Clark he "respected" Baker's "judgment" even though Baker had told him "he didn't think Bound East for Cardiff . . . was a play at all" (pp. 27-28)—(Baker may have been referring to "Children" not "Cardiff")—and why Baker, when he wrote an essay on "O'Neill's First Decade" for The Yale Review of July, 1926, cited "Cardiff" preparatory to remarking that O'Neill "perfected himself in one-act plays before he became successful in longer plays" (rpt. in Oscar Cargill, et. al., eds., O'Neill and His Plays, Four Decades of Criticism [1961], p. 244) and gave no indication he thought "Cardiff" was not a play. But at this time, the hypothesis lacks support from any objective documentary evidence.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Lucas Beauchamp, Ned Barnett, and William Faulkner's 1940 Will by Robert W. Hamblin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Readers of William Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust are familiar with the land grant to Lucas Beauchamp by his white kinsman, Zack Edmonds: "how [Carothers] Edmonds' father had deeded to his Negro first cousin and his heirs in perpetuity the house and the ten acres of land it sat in—an oblong of earth set forever in the middle of the two-thousand-acre plantation like a postage stamp in the center of an envelope." 1 Not generally known, however, is that eight years before the publication of Intruder in the Dust Faulkner had made a somewhat similar provision in his last will and testament for Ned Barnett, the black man who had faithfully served four generations of the Faulkner family. "Uncle Ned," as Barnett was affectionately called, was the male counterpart in the Faulkner household to Caroline ("Mammy Callie") Barr. He had been a servant of W. C. Falkner, the Nobel Laureate's great-grandfather, and had moved to Oxford after the death of his master in 1889. Transferring his allegiance to one after another of the Old Colonel's descendants, Barnett became, in William's time, the butler at Rowan Oak and a tenant farmer at Greenfield Farm. Faulkner records his recollection of the old retainer in the semi-autobiographical essay entitled "Mississippi": Ned, born in a cabin in the back yard in 1865, in the time of the middleaged's greatgrandfather and had outlived three generations of them, who had not only walked and talked so constantly for so many years with the three generations that he walked and talked like them, he had two tremendous trunks filled with the clothes which they had worn—not only the blue brass-buttoned frock coat and the plug hat in which he had been the great-grandfather's and the grandfather's coachman, but the broadcloth frock coats which the great-grandfather himself had worn, and the pigeon-tailed ones of the grandfather's time and the short coat of his father's which the middleaged could remember on the backs for which they had been tailored, along with the hats in their eighty years of mutation too: so that, glancing idly up and out the library window, the middleaged would see that back, that stride, that coat and hat going down the drive toward the road, and his heart would stop and even turn over. 2 As Joseph Blotner has demonstrated, not only such love of finery but also Ned's amorous escapades, sharp wit, and independent spirit find expression in fictional creations like Simon Strother in Sartoris , Ned McCaslin in The Reivers , and Lucas Beauchamp. 3 On March 27, 1940, Faulkner executed a new will, revising the one he had prepared in 1934. Among other changes, Faulkner added a section providing for the disposition of Greenfield Farm, which he had purchased in 1938. The arrangement called for John, William's brother, to be given the first option to purchase the farm. To this provision Faulkner attached the following condition: The above devise is made with the understanding that Ned Barnett, colored, if he outlives me, is to have the house he now lives in, rent free, as long as he remains on this farm. If at my death the title to said farm is clear in my name, the said Barnett is to receive clear title to said house and the piece of ground on which it rests and the line between his property and the other property is to be established by my Executors and Testamentary Guardians and is not to infringe upon other buildings. The said Ned Barnett is also to have rent free to cultivate a five-acre piece of ground to be selected by my Executors and Testamentary Guardians and is to have such until his death at which time all of said property will revert to my estate. My Executors and Testamentary Guardians are also to see that the said Barnett is to have use of such livestock and tools as are on said farm and necessary to cultivate the land left to him. At the death of the said Ned Barnett, my Executors are to use whatever funds necessary from my estate to send his body where he wishes and to give him a decent funeral and burial. The amount to be spent therefor is to be determined solely by my said Executors. If the said Ned Barnett should leave said farm and my family, then my said Executors are to pay him from my estate Five ($5.00) Dollars per month until his death. 4 When Faulkner next revised his will, on February 1, 1951, he deleted the above section, Barnett having died in 1947. 5 The parallels between Faulkner's provision for Ned Barnett and Zack Edmonds' treatment of Lucas Beauchamp are striking, though doubtless of greater interest in the comparison is the obvious embellishment of fact so characteristic of Faulkner's handling of sources. The 1940 will provides just one more example of the manner in which history was transformed into the art of Yoknapatawpha.</field>
