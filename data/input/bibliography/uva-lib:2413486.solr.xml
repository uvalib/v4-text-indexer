This remark, made nearly ninety years ago by A. E. Housman in his well-known address "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism," suggests the crux of many recent editorial discussions, in which some of editing's most basic humanistic assumptions have been challenged with arguments influenced by the movement sometimes called "postmodern" literary theory. 1 1. Housman's address to the Classical Association was made at Cambridge on 4 August 1921, and printed in the proceedings of the Association the following year. The quotation is taken from the text as reprinted in Housman, Selected Prose , ed. John Carter (Cambridge: Cam- bridge Univ. Press, 1961), p. 136. Many of the challengers are themselves editors, and were motivated at least in part by a sense that textual criticism was both technically overdeveloped as a field and falsely estranged from literary criticism. An expressed inter- est in drawing textual and literary criticism nearer to one another (as if they were not already interpenetrated dimensions of the same discipline) was thus a prominent feature of many of the discussions. A second inter- est, also of an integrating character, was in surmounting the perceived national or linguistic isolation of Anglo-American editorial scholarship through an engagement with editorial traditions of other countries, espe- cially Germany and France. Movements to open intellectual horizons in this age of overly determined specialization are to be welcomed, and this one has had its benefits, as readers of Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research can attest. 2 2. New York: Modern Language Association, 1995. Many of the two dozen scholars whom David Greetham as- sembled for this unusual project exhibited a felt sense of responsibility in their contributions, which taken together provide Anglophone students with a useful history of textual criticism across several periods of time and many languages. Other expressions of dissatisfaction with a perceived narrowness in the editorial status quo have been less progressive, however, including many of the attempts to align textual criticism with contemporary trends in literary theory. It would not be unfair to say that interest in widen- ing the horizons of editing has not always and everywhere been sincere, some of it seeming to mask an anxiety that textual criticism, with its tra- ditional historical and biographical focus, and rigorous bibliographical preoccupations, was simply missing out on the wave of postmodernism that had swept through the English departments of American universities in the 1980s. While the swell of enthusiasm that marked the appearance of this wave has largely receded (along with an improbably abstruse and jargon-filled form of discourse), some of its dehumanizing ideas are still very much with us. The anti-objectivist, metaphysical conceits of the de- constructionist approach to texts, for example, found their way across the imaginary line separating literary from textual criticism, and were received with favor by some editors of English-language Renaissance and modern works. The evidence can be seen in the shift of editorial focus away from the author, even to the point at which the author is completely abnegated as an object of editorial interest. In recent editorial literature it is not impossible to find bizarre statements in which the human origins of texts are seemingly denied, and authors are redefined as abstract con- cepts conjured, depending on the argument, in the Romantic or Modern period. Objective reality is consequently denied also to aspects of the past having to do with authors' lives, and especially to the thoughts of authors in relation to particular works. These thoughts were an object of editorial discovery long before the moment in 1939 when R. B. McKerrow gave prominence to the idea of authors' intentions, and have for just as long a time served as a focal point for the critical reconstruction of works which imperfectly survive in documentary witnesses. 3 3. See McKerrow, Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare: A Study in Editorial Method (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939), p. 6; the term owes its wide circulation to Fredson Bowers, who adopted it for his editions, at least from the Centenary Hawthorne, which began appearing in 1962. Editors engaged in such reconstructions have accordingly bound themselves to approach variant readings or suspect passages with the author's preferences, rather than the preferences of others (including their own), in mind. Where authors themselves are liable to being reduced to posthumous concepts, author-centered critical texts not surprisingly have been denied scholarly legitimacy, often with the charge that these texts are "Platonic" ideals. As Stephen Orgel, one of the most influential opponents of the traditional bibliographical and editorial focus on the author, remarked in 1996, "the basic assumption of most editorial practice is that behind the obscure and imperfect text is a clear and perfect one, and it is the editor's job not to be true to the text's obscurity and imperfection, but instead to produce some notional platonic ideal." 4 4. Stephen Orgel, "What Is an Editor?" This essay was originally prepared for an MLA symposium in 1993; it was first printed in Shakespeare Studies 24 (1996): 23–29, and reprinted as chapter 3 of Orgel's The Authentic Shakespeare and Other Problems of the Early Modern Stage (New York and London: Rouledge, 2002), pp. 15–20; the quotation is taken from p. 16 of the reprint. Professor Orgel's views have some points of coincidence with those of Jerome McGann, who, while not as regardless as Orgel of the author's importance, is another of the many voices suggesting that traditional scholarly editorial practices have as their design the recovery of a perfect text—a pursuit which once posited is derided as futile. This circular criticism has been heard often enough in recent years that it has begun to influence the self-consciousness of some editors whose editorial approach remains author-centric. 5 5. Attempts to equate author-centered editing with Platonic idealism, however misguided, are usually made as criticisms, but apparently sympathetic efforts to link the two have also been made. Donald Reiman, believing he was praising (rather than misinterpreting) G. Thomas Tanselle's A Rationale of Textual Criticism , remarked that it provided "a clear, concise, and cogent statement of his Platonic vision of the 'work' that floats above 'texts'" ("Nineteenth-Century British Poetry and Prose," Scholarly Editing , ed. D. C. Greetham, p. 324); see also "Fair Copy, Authorial Intention, and 'Versioning'" by James L. W. West III, ( Text 6 [1994]: 81–89), in which the authorially intended critical text is described as an "eclectic ideal." Hans Walter Gabler, editor of the author-focused Ulysses: The Corrected Text , has referred to the appearance of "notional stability" attained by the Greg-Bowers tradition's "editorial model of the ideal text," which takes the form "of the text of archetypal purity or, as its mirror image, that of the text of authorial final intentions…." For Gabler, however, "copy-text eclecticism" is an essentially unstable notion, since, as a product of Anglo-American pragmatic thinking, it has only been "conceived of as stable in pre-theoretical terms…." He seems to acknowledge the practical affinities of the Greg-Bowers approach and "German text-critical thought," while preferring the latter because it supposedly takes account of structuralism and literary theory. Gabler seems ready to concede, that is, that the two traditions pursue idealist editorial goals, and only differ in the level of sophistication attained in their idealism; see Gabler's "Textual Criticism," in The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory &amp; Criticism , ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1994), pp. 708–714, quotations from p. 711. While mo- mentarily pervasive due partly to residual postmodern trends in literary theory, the image of the authorially intended critical text as an ideal text in the Platonic sense is the outcome of a basic misunderstanding. A clue to the source of the confusion can be found in the manner in which the Platonic label has been attached to traditional editorial activity—some philosophical language is used in the criticisms, but no philosophical argu- ment is seriously developed. What in Platonic terms is meant by the label itself is not easy to see: the critics never discuss whether they believe that author-centered editors are pursuing ideal forms (the apparently separate Platonic world of objective essences, discussed in many dialogues) corre- sponding to the sensational forms of the literary works they are editing, or a universal aesthetic form (αὑτὀ ὁ ἕστι καλόν), such as that presented in the Symposium , which the author had also presumably pursued. Where the first pursuit is postulated and criticized, the position of the critics would seem to admit exclusively of "sensational" (or material) forms for literary works—an interesting point needing, however, a good deal more elabo- ration than is ever attempted. As for the second pursuit, it would seem, since Plato ascribed priority to universal forms, that the critics were main- taining that traditional editors believed that these forms could be recol- lected, already perfect, though here too necessary elaboration is wanting. Most obviously missing from the arguments, however, is some treatment of Plato's view of art, wherein universals were denied to artistic creations (on the grounds that most art was mere imitation of natural things), and their authors refused admission to the ideal republic. This preliminary examination of the criticisms would lead to a conclusion that Platonic forms are not being referred to, and the name and thought of Plato have little significance to the critics beyond a vaguely understood connection to idealism in general. For while the critics do not agree among themselves on the editorial alternatives, they do seem mainly united in a view that traditional author-focused critical editing involves a belief in the existence of a pure, ideal text, and a willingness to strive after it. The source of the confusion is the same as that suggested by Housman, when he ascribed a certain class of editorial blunders and misconceptions to the fact that the objects of editorial attention are not of a "corporeal" nature. I The critical editorial approach to Anglophone literary works which arose alongside the "New Bibliography" had detractors before the ar- rival of the postmodern wave, the adherents of which, furthermore, were not even the first to describe it as a Platonic pursuit. As far back as 1959, Shakespeare scholar Leo Kirschbaum criticized the editorial vi- sion of Fredson Bowers for, among other things, its supposed "Platonic idea of an Elizabethan dramatic text—an absolute, unchangeable, holy thing.…" 6 6. Leo Kirschbaum, "On the Editing of Elizabethan Texts," Opportunities for Research in Renaissance Drama 5 (1959–60): 13–20, quotation from p. 17. Kirschbaum read his paper at MLA Conference 23 in 1959; the published form contains his addendum and note. G. Thomas Tanselle called attention to Kirschbaum's criticisms (and the familiarity of their sound to today's ears) in "The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers" ( Studies in Bibliography 46 [1993]: 1–154, see p. 105). Tanselle reports (pp. 103–104) that Bowers initially objected to its publication, which is understandable, since Kirschbaum, who also criticized other contributors to Studies in Biblio- graphy , had used an especially condescending tone when he came to speak of the scholarship of Alice Walker. The same tone marred a review by Kirschbaum of volume 9 (1957) of Studies in Bibliography , but only in places where the work of Bowers and Walker is being discussed ( Shake- speare Quarterly 8 [Autumn 1957]: 544–546). Much of the editorial discussion that shaped Bowers's ap- proach was centered on works of the English Renaissance, and so past and present opponents of critical editing have sometimes attempted to support their criticisms by referring to the declining fortunes of certain hypotheses of tradition advanced by McKerrow and his colleagues and successors, especially those involving the origins of Shakespeare's plays. Paul Werstine, an active latter-day critic of the concept of authorial in- tention, has in several essays sought to discredit W. W. Greg's editorial recommendations by undermining his investigations into the problems of Shakespearean transmission. Dissecting Greg's discussions about the manuscript origins of a few of the early printed texts, Werstine attempts to show in "Post-Theory Problems in Shakespeare Editing" that they con- stitute, in Werstine's oft-repeated Lyotardian phrase, a "grand narrative," whose supposed purpose is "the conservation of the Romantic view that the greatest art we have was produced by the individual genius working in splendid isolation from the rest of his culture." 7 7. "Post-Theory Problems in Shakespeare Editing," Yearbook of English Studies 29 (1999): 103–117, quotation from p. 104. In this paper Werstine accuses Greg of "fact-making" and "manu-fact-ure" in the service of the supposed "grand narrative"; his mantric repetition of this phrase (twenty times) suggests self-doubt of his account of Greg's scholarship, which comes near accusing Greg of knowing falsification. Further of Werstine's attacks on Greg and his contem- poraries can be found in his "Narratives About Printed Shakespeare Texts: 'Foul Papers' and 'Bad' Quartos," Shakespeare Quarterly 41 (Spring 1990): 65–86. For the tolerant reader there are some limited lessons to be learned in Werstine's overall skepti- cism of the discoveries of the New Bibliography, and even in his criti- cisms of Greg's individual hypotheses about whether certain printed texts were based on actors' memorial reconstructions or Shakespeare's "foul papers." What good there is, however, must be carefully strained from an environment of distorted representations of Greg's motives and even aspersions on his character (as well as sprinklings of some rapidly aging postmodern jargon). For readers unfamiliar with the original discussions, the danger is high that Werstine's misrepresentations will be absorbed along with his sometimes insightful analyses and reassessments of the evi- dence. Particularly damaging in this respect is Werstine's unprincipled amalgam of some speculations of Greg's contemporary J. Dover Wilson with Greg's well-known contribution to editorial practice. In a later es- say, Werstine goes so far as to say that "Greg's theory of copy-text rests to a large extent on his confidence in Wilson's work on Hamlet ." 8 8. Werstine, "Editing Shakespeare and Editing Without Shakespeare: Wilson, Mc- Kerrow, Greg, Bowers, Tanselle, and Copy-Text Editing," Text 13 (2000): 27–53, quotation from p. 41. In fact, Wilson's work on Hamlet is not mentioned in "The Rationale of Copy- Text," Greg's influential statement of editorial principles; nor even do the plays of Shakespeare figure largely among the examples he uses in that essay to demonstrate his main insight—that a revised edition of a work, containing the author's last preferred wording, may not be as faithful to his or her preferred formal details ("accidentals") as the earlier edition, if the later typesetting was based on it. Readers of Greg's The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , furthermore, will be surprised to find Werstine, working from a few fleeting and circumspect remarks he has found there, fashioning a wholesale endorsement of Dover Wilson's views on Hamlet 9 9. The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare is cited in notes 22 and 23 and further discussed in the corresponding text. The masking of Greg's reservations about Wilson's views may mislead new scholars, who will have to seek elsewhere, at any rate, for an appre- ciation of the many important and enduring advances in the investigation of play origins owed to Greg's scholarship. Readers of Stephen Orgel's The Authentic Shakespeare , a collection of essays warmly received by Professor Werstine, will find themselves con- fronted with an even less accurate picture of the editorial views and pur- poses of Greg and the tradition he represents (though Orgel criticizes Greg's ideas without using his name). At the center of this distorted rep- resentation, contained mainly in two brief opening essays, "What Is a Text?" and "What Is an Editor?", is the familiar assertion that critical ed- iting in the main involves the pursuit of a Platonic ideal text. 10 10. "What Is a Text?" is the first (pp. 1–5) and "What Is an Editor?" the third (pp. 15–20) essay in The Authentic Shakespeare (see notes 4 and 11). With the intervening "What Is a Char- acter?" (which first appeared in Text 8 [1996]), the trio of titles refer to Michel Foucault's 1969 lecture-essay, "Qu'est-ce qu'un auteur?" (a title which in turn refers to Roland Barthe's earlier "La morte de l'auteur"). Foucault's work, a prototypical postmodern semantical exercise in the dehumanization of textual origins, may have been the first to refer to authors as "functions." In Foucault's view these functions have operated only when certain circumstances are pres- ent: otherwise, the author seemed to him (for the purposes of the exercise, at any rate) more of a nonentity than a function. Though Orgel confesses owing "more to D. F. MacKenzie and Jerome McGann than to Foucault" (p. xix), he endorses Foucault's denial of authorship ("Foucault has shown us …," p. 19), a position also adopted by Paul Werstine (see note 56); the latter's praise for The Authentic Shakespeare can be found in his review in Shakespeare Quarterly 54 (Winter 2003): 461–463. The asser- tion is meant to serve as a foil for Orgel's often convincing demonstrations of the instability of texts, which would fail to achieve the insightful effect Orgel seeks for them if they were cast against a more balanced assessment of Greg's views. Orgel also discounts—or rather, attempts to abnegate— the traditional editorial connotation of the word authority , meaning writ- ing which came from the author. His objections to this connotation are representative of a range of similarly strong reactions recorded by other scholars seeking to diminish the importance of the author in the literary process. In their discussions the critics typically ignore the restricted but indispensable traditional editorial meaning, and Orgel is no exception. To those familiar and comfortable with that meaning, the objections to it seem, again, to be the result of a misunderstanding—whether willful or not—rather than of a genuine disagreement. Orgel wants the word to mean social power or control, to the exclusion of all other meanings. He accordingly presumes that only those with legitimate or financial power can have authority, and concludes that authors are without authority since in his view they are often paid servants mechanically satisfying the demands of their powerful employers. In the English Renaissance, Orgel explains, the "authority of the published text was … that of the pub- lisher: he owned it; the author's rights in the work ended with his sale of the manuscript. The publisher was fully entitled to alter the manuscript if he saw fit—the manuscript was his." 11 11. Stephen Orgel, "What Is a Text?", was written for a Modern Language Association Panel in 1980, and first published in Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama 24 (1981): 3–6; the remarks were then reprinted as chapter 1 in The Authentic Shakespeare , the source of the quotation (p. 3). Here it is easy to see that Orgel's use of the term authority is simply incongruous with how the term has been used in scholarly editing. That a misconception is operating is made plainer by Orgel's attempt to clarify his views with an analogy about painting. "Once the painting has been sold," Orgel explains, referring to painting in general, "we do not believe that the artist has any further rights in it." The owner, according to Orgel, has the authority to mutilate or even destroy it, as was the fate meted out by Clementine Churchill to Graham Sutherland's portrait of her husband Winston: "to believ- ers in the autonomy of the artist, the painting was a Sutherland; but to Churchill, the painting was a version of himself, and he didn't like it. The authority in this case belonged to the subject/patron.…" 12 12. Ibid., p. 4. Here a basic misconception (the confusion of the two meanings of the same word) and a subordinate misconception (the reference to those who understand the editorial meaning of authority as believers in something called "the au- tonomy of the artist") are compounded together with the false equation of two incongruous artistic genres. A painting is a particular material object; the destruction of the object is the same as the destruction of the work of art. A literary work, however, is not a material object, but sequences of words; the destruction of a particular material object that records the words does not necessarily destroy the work itself—unless the object is the only record and no one has committed the text to memory. It must further be pointed out that for those who understand the editorial meaning of authority, as a measure of that which came from the author, the authority of the painting Mrs. Churchill destroyed was unique to that object and could not be transmitted to another object—even by Sutherland, who in attempting to do so would only create another Sutherland painting, with an authority all its own. Whatever aesthetic judgments might be made of them, hand-painted "copies" of paintings are not copies from an edi- torial point of view, but unique objects possessing the authority of their creators—and none of the authority of the "copied" work. The same does not hold true of texts, where the authority present in the text of one docu- ment may be transferred in the making of another. Since a literary work consists of the ordered thoughts of the author (or authors)—conveyed to the mind of the reader or audience by means of a particular sequence of inscribed symbols or vocalized sounds—it may be truly represented by any number of "copies," whether symbolic or spoken, as long as they are linguistically accurate. 13 13. In its narrowest conception, which is necessary for the editing of a critical text, author- ity is not present in a document copied from an existing authoritative document, unless the copy was made by the author, or reflects an author's intervening alterations. While variants in derivative documents are thereby without authority, they may be of use editorially, since vari- ants in early copies may reflect early attempted corrections. Insofar as a derivative document is an accurate copy, however, it can be said to preserve the authority of the original. Bowers had this conception of authority in mind when he edited the Centenary Hawthorne. In "A Preface to the Text" Bowers held that, in addition to the "primary authority of Hawthorne's manuscript": "authority is defined as resident in any document printed directly from a Haw- thorne manuscript or from some other document, such as another edition, that had been cor- rected or revised by Hawthorne or by some other person utilizing a Hawthorne manuscript. Such authoritative texts are called substantive, as contrasted with derived" ( The Scarlet Letter , Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Volume 1, ed. William Charvat, Roy Harvey Pearce, Claude M. Simpson, Fredson Bowers, and Matthew J. Bruccoli [Ohio State Univ. Press, 1962], pp. xxxiii, xxxii). Not long ago, the meaning of the word authority was the subject of discussion within the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions (MLA/CSE), in its reformu- lation of the "Guiding Questions for Vettors" of critical editions. These questions, along with a "Glossary of Terms," have been included in a recent MLA-sponsored editorial guide, Electronic Textual Editing (ed. Lou Burnard, Katherine O'Brien O'Keeffe, and John Unsworth [New York: Modern Language Association, 2006]). In the version of this book that was previewed on the "Textual Encoding Initiative" web site, the glossary contains the following entry for the word Authority , which was written by former CSE chair Robert H. Hirst. The description is helpfully more expansive than Bowers's, but shares its basic conception: "Authority is an attribute of any text, or any variant between texts, indicating that it embodies the author's active intention to make or choose a particular arrangement of words and marks of punctuation. Some texts or variants may be said to have "no authority" because they were merely copied (accurately or otherwise) from an earlier text, but without the author's intervention. On the other hand, texts that were set from copy revised by the author are said to contain "new authority," meaning that some of the words and punctuation in them arose from authorial revision of her own text. Likewise, the authority of a holograph manuscript is usually greater than any typesetting of it, but the manuscript's authority at any given point may be superseded by the typesetting if the author made changes on proof or any other intervening document" (&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/ Activities/ETE/Preview/hirst.xml&gt;, visited April 2008). Hirst has informed me that a revised definition was also circulated, to recognize that certain works may have more than one author, but also to indicate that, in the minds of some scholars at least, authority can be extended to those such as "typesetters, proofreaders, or re- print publishers," who have traditionally been regarded as agents of unauthorized changes in texts (private letter, 9 February 2007). The first of these revisions, concerning co-authorship, extends rather than alters the logic of the traditional meaning of the word; the scholars who subscribe to the second revision, however, seem to be overreacting to the alternative prefer- ence, expressed by many prominent editors since the 1970s, for first-edition copy-texts of printed works. In the minds of those who originally held it, the preference for "house styling" over an author's spelling and punctuation probably did not quite entail conference of authority on the publisher's staff or printers. Past and present editorial disagreements over the extent to which the term could be used to signify non-authorial changes have not, at any rate, put at is- sue, as Orgel does, the central role of the author as the creator of authoritative texts. If, to respect Orgel's set of parameters, an author creates a work according to a publisher's general design, it would still have to be conceded that the design is fulfilled according to that author's unique artistic inclinations. Literary creations, no less than fashions of dress or laws, outwardly define a society, but also inwardly reflect its de- mands. In literature the demands, or influences, may be directly related to the work at hand, such as a publisher's command or a friend's advice; or they may be less apparently related to the work but no less formative of the author's intentions, such as the author's memories of the past, or reac- tions to contemporary public or private events. That influences play upon and shape the mind and taste of the author is, however, of keen interest to the author-centered editor. Furthermore, the author at last must create the work, and what happens to it after he or she relinquishes it—whether it is deliberately or accidentally altered by others, for example, or even altered by the author, under the pressure of an undeniable demand by some powerful person—does not erase the historical fact of the text as it was before the alterations were made. How much of the unaltered text may be recovered is a matter which depends on the totality of the avail- able evidence, but the recovery of this text has been the purpose of textual criticism since its earliest known existence. Other examples of Orgel's use of the word authority might be sum- moned as further proof of his belief that publishers, producers, patrons, owners—but not authors—have power and influence in society as a whole and in its artistic dimensions. 14 14. In "What Is a Text?" for example, Orgel refers to patrons' instructions in the commis- sioned works by two famous artists, asking, "when we write about a Lippi painting or an Inigo Jones drawing, are we really writing about Lippi or Jones?" ( The Authentic Shakespeare , p. 3). For Orgel, that is, authority means the instructions, not the artists' rendering of them. While naming "Filippo Lippi," Orgel does not specify whether he is referring to the father or the son (symptomatic, perhaps, of his view of the artist's importance). It is likely, however, that the elder Lippi is meant, since his efforts to follow his patrons' instructions carefully are documented. Tradition has it, however, that the elder Lippi's most important patron was of another mind on the question at issue: Cosimo de' Medici il vecchio was, according to Vasari, moved enough by his relationship with Lippi to have said of artists, "I'eccellenze degli ingegni rari sono forme celesti e non asini vetturini" ("great minds are celestial forms and not asses for hire"); the great humanist editor Poliziano (see note 39), furthermore, reportedly credited the elder Cosimo with originating or popularizing the Renaissance proverb, "every painter paints himself" ("ogni pittore dipinge sè"; quoted in Gloria Fossi, Filippo Lippi , trans. Lisa Pelletti Clark [Firenze: SCALA, 1990], p. 3; see also pp. 10, 16). More than usual is known of the elder Lippi's com- missions and collaborators (partly because of the artist's legal troubles), as well as his influences (Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Donatello, Flemish art), but this knowledge has not diminished ap- preciation of the uniqueness of his artistic vision nor the magnificence of its achievements. Most editors would not argue with the essentials of this belief (while perhaps feeling that it is stated too cat- egorically), but neither would they concede that the editorial connotation of the term authority , as a measure of textual proximity to that which the author created or intended to create, is much affected by discussions of other meanings of the word. The exclusive definition proposed by Orgel might at first seem to be justified by his view of the author—as little more than an employee carrying out the instructions of the powerful. Yet even an author (or authors) who creates a play according to someone else's instructions about plot and characters produces an "authoritative" manuscript in the traditional meaning of the term. An editor interested in recreating the author's text would, in addition to repairing it of scribal or compositorial errors, seek also, evidence permitting, to separate it from later non-authorial alterations, such as modifications made by others for performance. For an author-centered critical text, neither the errors nor the acting changes have authority; an editor pursuing a collaborative so- cial text would extend the conception of authority to comprehend the acting changes. 15 15. By "collaborative social text" an understanding is assumed of the ideas developed by Jerome McGann, in which the relationship between authors and their societies manifest in the publication process is granted greater editorial recognition, at the partial expense of the editorial concept of authorial intention; practically, McGann's considerations favor (with conditions) acceptance in the critical text of alterations made by persons other than authors, such as publishers' agents. His ideas are elaborated in his books A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1983; repr. with a foreword by D. C. Greetham and preface by the author, Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1992); and The Textual Condition (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991). Unlike Orgel's conception, however, the conception of authority modified to guide the social textual editor bears a distinct rela- tion to the original author-centered one. Authority in the sense of social power is a self-evidently important concept affecting artistic creations as much as any other aspect of organized human life. To claim that this concept negates the editorial meaning of the word, however, is as illogical as would be a claim that the concept of powerlessness negates the editorial designation of codex descriptus . Authoritative and derived texts are useful editorial concepts that cannot be disposed of by value judgments relegat- ing the author to the margins of the creative process. Orgel's conclusion about traditional editing, that it is a striving for a Platonic ideal, emerges from the following set of assertions: The idea that spelling and punctuation have no rules in the period, and are a function of the whim of the compositor, the whole concept of accidentals —a class of textual elements …that we may alter without altering meaning—has come under heavy scrutiny. Behind these assumptions is an unacknowledged subtext: that the printing process is transparent and what we want from the editorial process is an unmediated access to the mind of the author; that, moreover, we can get closer to the author than the printer with a manuscript (which may or may not have been authorial) before him could; that there are elements of a text that are inessential or merely conventional, that they don't effect the meaning and we can therefore safely change them.… Behind all this is a still deeper assumption, that not only the meaning of the text, but the text itself is somehow independent of its material embodiment. 16 16. The Authentic Shakespeare , pp. 15–16. It can be acknowledged, in respect to Orgel's remark about the assump- tion of the transparency of the printing process, that the discovery and development of methods of bibliographical analysis in the first half of the twentieth century tended to foster an overconfident mood concern- ing possible results. Given early successes some confidence was to be expected; overconfidence showed itself when bibliography was set upon problems (especially in Shakespeare) that could not be decisively resolved within the limits of the existing evidence. One temptation was to see me- chanical causes in textual variation that all literary sense would suggest was the result of purposeful alteration, authorial or otherwise. To react as Orgel does, however, to the early ambitions of analytical bibliography by positing the simple identification of a work of literature with a "material embodiment" suggests a kind of idealism in itself, in which documents necessarily appear, but authorless and without tradition, with the contin- gent gaps in the historical record transformed into an essential mystery. Orgel's blanket statement (at the beginning of "What Is a Text?"), that "at the heart of our texts lies a hard core of uncertainty," seems, however, not so much an idealist credo about cognitive limits as a casually exaggerated conclusion about the expectations and results of analytical bibliography. 17 17. Ibid. , p. 1. Whether or not A. W. Pollard, McKerrow, or Greg sometimes expected too much is a matter of small importance relative to their accomplish- ments, prominent among which were the establishment of methods of bibliographic analysis, and the permanent connection of these to the edit- ing of Anglophone literature. Orgel's awareness of these achievements is demonstrated in some of his other essays (notably "Acting Scripts, Per- forming Texts")—even as he attempts to press his main point about the unimportance of authors. Orgel's mention of "accidentals" is of course a reference to W. W. Greg's essay "The Rationale of Copy-Text," in which the authority of the accidentals (spelling, punctuation, word division, and emphasis) of a work, was, for certain editorial situations, treated separately from that of its "substantives" (wording). Anyone familiar with Greg's argument will at once recognize that it has not so much been misinterpreted as per- fectly inverted—an unfortunate effect, perhaps, of the disregard of the editorial meaning of the word authority . Greg conceived of the division out of his concern that authorial spelling and punctuation be preserved as far as possible. The concern was connected to the editorial problem engendered when a revised edition of a work was typeset from an earlier edition. As Greg observed, the later edition is derivative where it does not incorporate the author's changes; since accidental variants so often resist reasonable selection, those of the earlier edition should be preferred in instances of doubt, as more likely to be authentic. Though the term has sometimes seemed to invite misinterpretation, accidentals was coined by Greg in an attempt to indicate greater instability in the transmission pro- cess, not intrinsic insignificance. Those involved in transmitting the text seemed either to treat spelling and punctuation with less care than they did the words, or felt freer to alter them deliberately. Revising authors, furthermore, were rarely able or willing to halt or reverse the deterio- rating trend. Finally, since a scholarly editor is a better judge of verbal variants than accidental variants, Greg recommended that questionable accidental variants from the revised text be regarded as without author- ity. A critical edition of the revised text, he furthermore concluded, would better rely upon the accidentals of the earlier edition in cases of doubt. The idea, again, was to preserve the most authoritative level of spelling and punctuation, by "generally" adopting the accidentals of the earliest surviving document in a series. As for the variant wording, that, said Greg, "belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies alto- gether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text." 18 18. W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography 3 (1950–1951): 19–36, quotations from p. 26. This particular charge of "Platonism," at least, falls on one of its at- tempted justifications—an accusation of carelessness about accidentals. While utterly misplaced in a discussion of Greg's editorial practices, the accusation, not surprisingly, becomes undisputed fact when its direction is reversed. As he intimates in The Authentic Shakespeare (p. 17), and demon- strates in the Pelican Shakespeare, which he co-edited, Orgel is a "mod- ernizing" editor, preferring to alter Elizabethan spelling and punctuation according to a necessarily personal notion of what modern readers will find "accessible." 19 19. William Shakespeare, The Complete Works , ed. Stephen Orgel and E. R. Braunmuller (New York: Penguin, 2002); Orgel admits to a certain reluctance in modernizing, calling it "not the best way" for an editor to preserve the "archaeology" of textual artifacts ( The Authentic Shakespeare , pp. 16–17). He is nonetheless part of a modernizing majority, many of whose con- stituents are less reluctant. Cambridge professor Anne Barton recently chided another scholar for suggesting that "reading Shakespeare in old-spelling editions" has advantages: conceding that modernization "obscured" textual "subleties and nuances," she called this "a small price to pay when weighed against the distancing of Shakespeare from the contemporary reader that old spellings impose." She further explained that "all good recent editions" of Shakespeare modernize, while the Oxford original-spelling edition (see note 53) "has not proved to be a success," concluding that "[t]here is no real controversy here" (Anne Barton, "'Words, Words, Words,'" New York Review of Books , 29 March 2007, pp. 27–28). There ought to be a contro- versy, however, since students of English at the university level are generally being deprived of the opportunity to study Shakespeare's art and language without the "distancing" removed; it might be further noted that the "success" of an old-spelling edition can be measured also by scholarly criteria, including the degree to which it has satisfactorily recovered and illuminated early moments in the life of literary works. The modernized Shakespeare, a fixture in university classrooms for generations, was called into question in the first half of the last century by Greg and his colleagues, who began to pay deserved atten- tion to period spelling and punctuation. Following them, Fredson Bowers made old-spelling the practical norm for scholarly editions, and in his edi- tions always adopted what he believed were the author's accidentals (or the nearest recoverable semblance thereof). 20 20. Bowers's approach to the problem of old-spelling editions was eminently practical, if a bit on the soft side theoretically. In "Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts" he revealed his plan for making critical texts of Renaissance works "more attractive to the general user…." He likely used McKerrow's Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare as a starting point from which to propose innovations, including the removal of the apparatus from the bottom of the page (where McKerrow suggested it should be) to the back of the book, and some blanket spelling changes: "an old-spelling editor should modernize the u:v and i:j conventions, just as he now customarily normalizes the old long s in the interests of the present-day reader" (address read before a Modern Language Association conference in 1957; first printed in Studies in Honor of T. W. Baldwin , ed. D. C. Allen [Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1958], pp. 9–15, repr. in Fredson Bowers, Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia for the Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1975], pp. 289–295, quotations from p. 294 of the reprint). Earlier in this address (p. 292) Bowers had asserted that "No system of modernization can be contrived that does not do violence to the Elizabethan English of a play." The spelling changes he proposed (and followed in his editions) were, it is true, slight compared to the changes demanded by most systems of modernization, but, he said, they nonetheless risked "offending some conservatives.…" In Prolegomena , McKerrow had allowed only altera- tion of "f" to "s" (against his own better judgment, he said) and substitution of "w" for "vv". That is, he was faithful to the Elizabethan use of i, j, u, and v (whose rules, McKerrow noted elsewhere, were fairly fixed), as a glance at his specimen Richard III pages show (see Prolegom- ena , pp. 20 n. 4, III ff.; McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927], p. 310). This ought not be forgot- ten, though Orgel's mistaken statement about accidentals may have been partly triggered by Bowers's perverse habit of declaring, in contravention of his practical attitude, that accidentals lacked basic significance. Never- theless, when editors with social concerns favor modernization—and in this Orgel joins Jerome McGann—they would seem not only to forswear all logical criticism of the reasoned eclecticism of author-focused editing (not to mention criticism of the seriousness with which that orientation has treated accidentals), but also to create the very dichotomy between literary and textual criticism that they profess to oppose. 21 21. Jerome McGann wrote in favor of modernization in A Critique of Modern Textual Criti- cism (see note 15), pp. 112–113. The authori- ally intended critical text is eclectic insofar as it is a reconstruction of a particular moment in the history of a work of literature to which no one document bears adequate witness. The editor therefore needs the free- dom to bring together variants from as many sources as necessary (includ- ing his or her own mind), but the process of selecting and arranging them takes place within a strict historical framework. The process is focused on recovering the author's preferences; one could criticize it for sacrificing the preferences of society (as represented by scribes, actors, publishers, proofreaders, printers, etc.), but in a well-constructed critical edition these are not far to seek, since rejected variants are recorded in the apparatus. It should not need saying, but by removing the historical limits, mod- ernizing editors deny readers not only the authorially intended text, but also the social text. Social textual theory, as articulated by McGann and endorsed in one or another form by Orgel and many others of like mind, holds that literary and dramatic works are collaborative products, created as much by commissioning patrons, acting companies, and publishing companies as by authors; it should follow from this that the text presented in a scholarly edition ought to reflect the concept of collaboration. The implications of the approach remain unexplored, however, since practical demonstrations in the form of social textual editions are slow in appear- ing. The expressed preference for modernization suggests, however, that some social textual theorists would rather not fully extend theory into practice. Reticence to provide editorial demonstrations of the social text may arise from a realization that, in discounting the importance of the author's preferences with respect to accidentals (and substantives), and el- evating those of society in their place, the new focus leads practically to a text with the linguistic attributes of the same period as those of the author- centered text. For Renaissance works, these attributes include early and irregular forms of spelling and punctuation, unfamiliar to modern eyes at first glance. Experience has shown, however, that with less patience than might at first be expected, modern readers can gain adequate facility in reading typographically faithful renderings of English-language Renais- sance texts. Nevertheless, some scholars halt after that first glance and de- cide that the forms of words (and certain words themselves) are obstacles to understanding and should be removed and replaced with forms the scholar finds more familiar. This line of reasoning proceeds from some glaring prejudices: that modern readers will not understand older forms of the written language, that these forms constitute a discrete rather than integral part of the language of the original, and that they are inessential to the meaning and can be exchanged for modern equivalents which will make the meaning clearer. Whether or not modernization has advantages in certain circumstances, its blanket application at the university level obviously impedes literary study. It pulls textual and literary criticism apart, and then casts the former discipline aside, not recognizing that its most basic function is textual interpretation; as for the latter discipline, it is left to beg original meanings of linguistic anachronisms, texts whose origins have been partly effaced according to elusive notions of what will be familiar to modern readers. In The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare Greg discussed the essential importance of accidentals, and of the need to pre- serve their original forms—even if these reflect only the intrusions of the author's contemporaries. Of the spelling he had this to say: Today a standard orthography masks quite a wide divergence of pronunciation even among people of the same local and social surroundings. In Shakespeare's day a writer's individualities of speech reflected themselves naturally in his spelling, and to alter his spelling is to destroy a clue to his language.… But, it will be objected, what in fact we usually possess is not the author's manu- script but an edition printed at best from that manuscript, perhaps more likely from a transcript or a transcript of a transcript, at worst from a memorial or shorthand report. Is such an edition likely to preserve sufficient of the individualities of an au- thor's spelling to make it worth while following it? This is, I think, where the ordinary reader is likely to misunderstand the critic's position. For the critic modernization has no attraction in itself. So long as there is any chance of an edition preserving some trace, however faint, of the author's individuality, the critic will wish to follow it: and even when there is none, he will still prefer an orthography that has a period resem- blance with the author's to one that reflects the linguistic habits of a later date. 22 22. W. W. Greg, "Note on Accidental Characteristics of the Text," in his The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare: A Survey of the Foundations of the Text , 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1951), pp. li–lii. Of the need to preserve original punctuation, Greg simply observed, "Just as the language of an Elizabethan author is better represented by his own spelling than by ours, so the flow of his thought is often more easily indicated by the loosely rhetorical punctuation of his own day than by our more logical system." It is this line of reasoning that has been twice missed: first when Greg is falsely criticized for believing that accidentals may be altered without altering meaning, and then when the misinformed critics circle back and favor or practice modernization. II Textual criticism, like all forms of scholarly investigation, is an activity in which standing hypotheses are tested and revised or replaced, often by the authors of the original hypotheses. Where the amount of evidence is limited and fixed, difficult problems may over time be judged insoluble, but only after an extended period of examination. Greg's scholarship is in a sense a model of this process, as it is in part a record of corrective second thoughts prompted by his own or others' further research. The history of The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare offers exemplary testimony to Greg's ever-growing views on the text of Shakespeare, most obviously in the preface to the second edition (written in 1950), in which is of- fered a catalogue of corrections of discussions appearing in the first edi- tion, along with references to further and better scholarship on particular points. The work had its origins in the series of Clark Lectures he deliv- ered at Cambridge in 1939, but before the lectures could be published, R. B. McKerrow's Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare appeared. This important book obviously demanded Greg's attention, especially since he found himself in some disagreement with McKerrow's conservative editorial principles. In preparing the lectures for publication in 1942, he expressed a "more elaborate and less rigid" approach in a preface, and in his own "Prolegomena" ("Prolegomena.—On Editing Shakespeare") gave a detailed introduction which contested some of McKerrow's recom- mendations, but also clarified many of his own. An appended essay, "Note on Accidental Characteristics of the Text," is a snapshot of Greg's think- ing on this subject at a point a few years in advance of "The Rationale of Copy-Text," and can deepen understanding of its better-known successor. Both the "Prolegomena" and the "Note" are helpful in demonstrating why the problem of "accidentals" became for Greg a key to unlocking the theoretical doors behind which the progress of critical editing had stalled. In his "Note" Greg confesses "strong 'conservative' instincts," and an editorial disinclination "to violate" the "integrity" of particular editions or manuscripts, but explains that these attitudes are reflections of the "bibliographer's outlook … only a stepping stone, though an essential one, towards the truly critical position." 23 23. Ibid., pp. [a–i], iv, liv n. 2. A third edition of Greg's book was brought out in 1954, for which he made further corrections and took welcome note of the appearance of Alice Walker's Textual Problems of the First Folio (Cambridge: Univ. Press, 1953). Though he believed the "im- plications" of Walker's work were "far reaching," he did not otherwise discuss it, nor did he make any significant revisions for the third edition, largely because his latest thoughts would soon be available in a new book, The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955). Through the development and application of methods of the physi- cal analysis of documents, this "stepping stone"—which, of course, was the New Bibliography—allowed for the possibility that judgment might again play a serious role in the editing of English literature. Judgment had been robbed of its privileges by foregoing editorial abuses, in which choices among variants were made haphazardly or according to the aes- thetic preferences of the editor. The conservatism of Greg and McKerrow was a natural enough reaction to the undisciplined editorial past, though they both strained under self-imposed restrictions. The strain was most felt in encounters with works surviving in multiple authorities, whose in- terrelationships could sometimes be revealed through a combination of bibliographical analysis and critical insight. On occasion the presence of authorial revision was suggested with more or less certainty, and so emerged the editorial problem of multiple recoverable moments in the life of literary works. The problem was new, for the most part. For most surviving ancient and medieval works the possibility of identifying more than one authorial version is excluded. Noteworthy exceptions are Ci- cero's Academica , which survives in partial original ( Priora ) and revised ( Posteriora ) versions, and the "Prologue" of the work by Chaucer tradi- tionally known as "The Legend of Good Women," for which it is ac- cepted that MS Gg contains the revised version of the earlier text (F) preserved in several other manuscripts (see also note 33). When A. W. Pollard and the others began developing methods to analyze printed books, they could not help but draw lessons from the editorial experi- ence of earlier literature, while taking note of differences. The differ- ences seemed first of all to have to do with the amount and quality of the textual evidence: while authors' manuscripts of works from the English Renaissance are rare, the surviving early printed editions were, by and large, made during or shortly after the authors' times. The apparently better quality of the evidence suggested that methodical investigation of mysteries of composition and tradition would be well rewarded; where early expectations were not satisfied, it was not for want of trying. 24 24. Greg was aware that satisfactory explanations of textual variation can be frustratingly slow in coming, and sometimes never arrive. In attempting to show that Greg contrived an abstract and rationalized "grand narrative" to explain the origin of Shakespeare's plays, Paul Werstine better reveals that for the most part each of Greg's hypotheses of tradition derived from and bore upon the details of a particular play, and that he readily abandoned hypotheses when logic and better research demanded it. Much of Werstine's case against Greg in "Nar- ratives About Printed Shakespeare Texts," for example, turns on a theory of the reportorial origins of the "bad" Quarto of The Merry Wives of Windsor , first published in 1910; as Werstine acknowledges, however, Greg altered his theory as early as 1928, and modified it further in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare . Neither does Werstine fail to recognize that Greg's final view that the relationship of the Quarto and Folio King Lear —a problem to which Greg devoted many years of thought—was still an open question (see pp. 77–79 in Werstine's "Narratives," cited in note 7). Greg concluded one of his last writings (published posthumously) with a character- istically open-minded criticism of the New Bibliography, which by then was no longer new. In noticing Fredson Bowers's uncertainty of the tradition of Thomas Dekker's works, he remarked, "Is it that our hopes of being able to infer from the features of a printed text the nature of the manuscript that served as copy are fated to vanish like a dream?" ("The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker. Edited by Fredson Bowers. Vol. III," Review of English Studies n.s. 10 [Nov. 1959]: 413–415, quotation from p. 415). Where clarity was obtained, however, the nature of the new editorial problem took shape. In this respect, historical importance attaches to McKerrow's judgment that certain of Nashe's works survive in an earlier, uncorrected edition, and a later edition which, while mainly derivative, also reflects Nashe's corrections and, as with The Vnfortunate Traveller , revisions. This may have been the first time that a scholarly editor, fully cognizant of the survival of multiple moments in the history of the work he was editing, was able to make a conscious choice to focus his critical text on one or the other. McKerrow decided on the later versions, and his decision to use them as his copy-texts was most famously recalled and criticized by Greg forty- odd years later, in "The Rationale of Copy-Text." This essay (appearing in the third volume of Studies in Bibliography ) opened a new vista in edi- torial thought, one in which greater responsibility would be referred to the judgment of the editor—the "truly critical position" of Greg's earlier "Note on Accidental Characteristics of the Text." "The Rationale" was one of the many important products of Greg's maturity, appearing in his seventy-fifth year, more than fifty of which had been given over to the study of Renaissance literature. In his youth he had been a pioneer of bibliographical analysis, and in the extremity of age he tirelessly advo- cated for an editorial approach fitted to its advantages and limitations. 25 25. Greg supplied a note on the text of The Vnfortvnate Traveller for F. P. Wilson's cor- rected and augmented reprint of McKerrow's The Works of Thomas Nashe (5 vols., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1958): see vol. 5, notes p. 33. As Wilson, who had solicited the essay, noticed in a posthumous tribute, Greg there made his final case for judgment-based editing, at the age of eighty-two (F. P. Wilson, "Sir Walter Wilson Greg, 1875–1959," Proceedings of the British Acad- emy 45 [1959]: 307–334; repr. in Sir Walter Wilson Greg: A Collection of His Writings , ed. Joseph Rosenblum, Great Bibliographers Series, No. 11 [Lanham, Md., and London: Scarecrow Press, 1998], pp. 1–28; see p. 19 of the reprint). The argument was forcefully stated, going so far as to describe as "perverse" McKerrow's policy of accepting whole an early printed text (after cor- recting it of obvious errors) in which he had detected both authorial revision and non-authorial alterations. Greg's reasoning was nonetheless as sound as ever: "Judgement must inevitably be exercised alike to detect the presence of authorial alterations and to eliminate 'obvious blun- ders and misprints', and there can be no logical reason for refusing to exercise it likewise to discriminate between alterations for which the author must be considered responsible and those due to some other agency…. The truth is that no critical principle can be devised that will relieve an editor of ultimate responsibility, and the risk of over-looking some authorial correc- tions is no excuse for an editor's including in his text readings that he himself believes to be of no authority at all. Essential as it is to eschew the excesses of eclecticism, any attempt to evade the responsibility of individual judgement is an abdication of the editorial function." To the point when McKerrow and Greg began to consider the problem typified by The Vnfortunate Traveller and present in certain other Renais- sance works, the widely accepted goal of editing—the movement of the received text closer to that which the author wrote—was of necessity minimally defined. Though multiple levels of authorial intention are not generally discernable in Renaissance works, Greg's recommendation in "The Rationale of Copy-Text" for the construction of a critical text of a revised work was ideally suited to the few, like The Vnfortunate Traveller , which evidently survive in sequential series of documents. While many Renaissance plays have two or more independent, often widely varying witnesses, their relationships cannot often be established, with the result that Greg's special copy-text recommendation can rarely be applied as prescribed. 26 26. The Complete Oxford Shakespeare (ed. Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, et al., 1986– 1987, see note 53), accepted much of Greg's work on the tradition of individual plays, including the substance of his views with respect to the use of foul papers and memorial reconstruction. The Oxford critical texts, furthermore, relate to the model proposed in "The Rationale of Copy-Text" wherever some advantage might accrue in respecting the accidentals (called "inci- dentals" by the Oxford editors) of a particular early print (cf. discussions of the plays surviving in multiple substantive authorities in Greg's Editorial Problem [see note 22] and Taylor's William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion [New York: W. W. Norton, 1997]). The Oxford editors may be best known for accepting a theory which Greg explicitly rejected: viz., that King Lear Q and F reflect, respectively, Shakespeare's original and revised versions. Yet while the Oxford edition presents separate critical texts for each version of Lear , both draw heavily on Greg's extensive research and discussions of this play. It was, however, in the editing of works of later periods, which are generally witnessed by a more ample documentary record, that the implications of Greg's discussion could unfold. The editorial experi- ence of American literature proved that Greg was in the right frame of mind, in emphasizing both textual genealogy and editorial judgment, in the approach to works for which ample evidence had survived. As the level of evidence rises, however, so does the complexity of the problem of authorial intention; for much of the literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the boundaries of discussion established in "The Ra- tionale of Copy-Text" are too narrow. Without expecting to approach it too nearly, McKerrow and Greg proposed as their editorial goal a text reflecting the moment when the author submitted a finally revised and corrected manuscript for publi- cation (or performance)—the "finally intended" text. 27 27. Greg adorned his critical edition of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus , based on the so-called B-text (1616) but relying also the A-text (1604), with a quotation from J. P. Postgate's entry for textual criticism in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911: "Where there is great or compli- cated divergence between the editions, as in the case of Marlowe's Faustus , the production of a resultant text which may be relied upon to represent the ultimate intention of the author is well-nigh impossible." From his prefatory remarks, Greg can be taken to have endorsed Postgate's judgment, which is interesting for its early expression of the editorial conception of final authorial intention ( The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus , A Conjectural Reconstruction by W. W. Greg [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950], quotation taken from p. iv of the 1961 repr.). When editors of American literature adopted Greg's recommendations they also adopted this goal, which for them was more nearly realizable—the literature of the last two or three centuries being represented not only by published forms, but often by prepublication documents, from authors' drafts to corrected proof sheets, and sometimes illuminating collateral material such as authors' notes and publishers' correspondence. The history of some works is therefore attested to well enough for editors to recognize a creative process and be able to reconstruct several stages in its life. The American editorial experience, with Greg's essay providing the theoreti- cal point of departure, was shaped in many practical engagements with the copious evidence, and accompanied by many more discussions and controversies. One of its great fortunes has been to have as its chronicler G. Thomas Tanselle, who was an important participant in both the prac- tical engagements (as an editor of the Melville edition), and the discus- sions and controversies, to which he made many of the most learned and satisfying contributions. His recent collection Textual Criticism since Greg (2005) is an indispensable guide to these discussions, which are carefully recounted, dissected, and clarified in six thick survey-essays written at intervals during thirty years. 28 28. G. Thomas Tanselle, Textual Criticism since Greg: A Chronicle, 1950–2000 (Charlottes- ville: Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 2005). This new edition of six essays supersedes an earlier edition containing only the first three; all the essays appeared originally in Studies in Bibliography . The initial essay, "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," which covers an unusually long period (twenty-five years) of scholarly discussion, guided the work of many editors from its appearance in 1975 ( SB 28); the remaining five essays cover discussions and disputes at intervals of roughly five years each. The volume contains nearly six hundred footnotes with references to perhaps two thousand editions of authors and books and articles on editing. The titles of three successive essays are sug- gestive of the problems that distinguish the editing of modern literature: "Historicism and Critical Editing" (covering discussions from the period 1979–1985), "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (1985–1990), and "Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism" (1990–1995). The titles, that is, call attention to the problems of authors' changing intentions and the nonauthorial alteration of texts. Authors of earlier literature changed their intentions too, of course, and their contemporaries and near- contemporaries also influenced and altered their works, but this kind of history only becomes generally visible—and therefore of central editorial concern—for scholars of recent literature. Many of the most important pages of Tanselle's surveys beginning with the "Historicism" essay are therefore devoted to elaborating the conception of authorial intention to address this history, and discussing the emerging editorial alternative of social textual theory. 29 29. The "Historicism" essay is also known for its continuation of the author's fruitful examination, begun in an earlier essay, of the false dichotomy of "literary" and "historical" approaches to scholarly editing—perpetuated mainly by scholars identifying themselves as historians as opposed to literary or textual critics. The earlier essay, "The Editing of Historical Documents," was one of Tanselle's most influential writings, as it offered helpful criticism of some relaxed editorial practices used in editions of the papers of American politicians; the es- say first appeared in Studies in Bibliography 31 (1978): 1–56, was distributed as a pamphlet at the interdisciplinary editorial conference mentioned in note 46, and was reprinted in G. Thomas Tanselle, Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia for the Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1990), pp. 218–273. Together, the three essays constitute an extended, many-sided exploration of what becomes visible to the editor of modern literature: the complexities of the artistic process and the dynamic inter- action of author and society. Tanselle's handling of several decades' worth of often rancorous editorial disputes has been exceedingly judicious and impartial, always seeking to clear away thoughtless or counterproductive verbiage so that the most useful insights might be better appreciated. The advantage to any discipline of having its scattered discussions brought together in the careful analyses of an eminent scholar need hardly be em- phasized; that much of the rancor which the author defused was directed at his own views—or at what detractors mistook for them—only in- creases the overall achievement. Tanselle's many original essays on edito- rial and bibliographical subjects had become essential reading for editors of American literature, and so those who began to question the "Greg- Bowers tradition" naturally saw the author as its inheritor and principal exponent. This identification was not inappropriate in itself, though the picture of the tradition painted by many of its critics might have been less distorted had more practicing editors engaged themselves in the discus- sions. The Greg-Bowers editorial model has been repeatedly criticized by a few editorial polemicists for its supposed interest in establishing a single, exclusively valid constructed text, reflecting only the author's last inten- tions, while denying the social, collaborative dimension of the creative process. To sustain this criticism, early, abstract, and simplified formula- tions of editorial theory were used as points of departure, while practical developments in the editions themselves were little accounted for. The effect of these misconceptions was heightened by an initial lack of clarity on the part of some author-focused editors about the need to deepen the definition of their editorial goal; later on, as the best editions began to present critical texts reflecting complex histories of composition and tradition, much of the insight within their covers went unnoticed and unpublicized. Apart from those of Bowers and Tanselle, that is, few contributions to the scholarly journals were made by practicing author- focused editors, while the journals published little in the way of mean- ingful assessments of the editions. These factors probably contributed to the emergence of social textual theory, since it was conceived partly as an alternative to a perceived narrowness in the authorial focus. In fair- ness to those who were moved by the arguments of Jerome McGann, social textual theory's chief progenitor, it should be noted that author- focused critical texts were sometimes viewed as necessary outcomes of an objective process, a fallacy that has caused confusion in more than one generation of scholarly editors. Tanselle began the process of clear- ing away some of the confusion and rectifying the theoretical disjuncture between the goal McKerrow and Greg had conceptualized and the edi- torial realities of more recent literature in his 1976 essay, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention." 30 30. Studies in Bibliography 29 (1976): 167–211, reprinted in Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (see previous note), pp. 27–71. In characteristically systematic fashion, the author drew upon practical lessons, most obviously from his own engagement with Melville's works, as well as pertinent philosophical and editorial discussions, to sharpen the concept of artistic intention and demonstrate its connection to scholarly editing. From the practical side it had already become apparent that many modern works survived in a series of variant documents, some of which seemed to suggest a progres- sion, whether of a steady or irregular character, toward a single final state, while others revealed complex forms of development, in which multiple "final" states could be identified as possible objects for attempted critical reconstructions. Not surprisingly, the evidence frequently revealed the involvement, welcome and not, of persons other than the author in the creative process. Tanselle discussed the expurgation of Melville's Typee and Stephen Crane's Maggie , calling attention to a large class of modern works whose themes and realistic language were more or less censored by or at the behest of publishers or their agents. A whole range of uncoerced, genuinely collaborative interactions between authors and others was also being discovered at this time. Of the discussions Tanselle examined in this early article, perhaps the most provocative and helpful in its way was "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts" by Hans Zeller. 31 31. Hans Zeller, "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," Studies in Bibliography 28 (1975): 231–264; Zeller (b. 1926), is professor emeritus of the Faculty of Letters of the University of Fribourg (Switzerland). Zeller pro- ceeded from an understanding that modern works present editors with rich and visible histories; he endorsed the concept of authorial intention as the proper focus for a critical edition, but rejected what he under- stood as the automatic preference of the Anglo-American approach for the author's last intentions. He furthermore disavowed editorial eclec- ticism, believing that each variant document, even if distinguished by but a single authoritative alteration, corresponded to a particular set of authorial intentions, and was therefore a discrete version of the work in question. In supplying a brief informative historical sketch of German editorial practices, especially in the determining field of Goethe criticism, Zeller found cause to examine the edition of Goethe's works prepared by the Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin (DDR), from 1949. The coincidence of this date with the appearance of "The Rationale of Copy-Text" enhances Zeller's comparison of Greg's recommendations with the practices of the edition's first editor, the learned German Jewish philologist Ernst Grumach (1902–67). 32 32. Grumach's many scholarly accomplishments include a bibliography of Cretan-Minoan epigraphy and an edition of Aristotle in German; he managed to survive slave labor under the Nazi regime, forced to make records of looted Jewish Books at the Reich Security Main Of- fice (RSHA) in Berlin. Two documents bearing witness to this experience, one authored by Grumach and the other co-authored by him with other survivors, were recently published in English: see Dov Schidorsky, " Confiscation of Libraries and Assignments to Forced Labor: Two Documents of the Holocaust," Libraries &amp; Culture 33 (Fall 1998): 347–388, for Grumach, see pp. 351, 384 n. 11 (this issue is available on-line at &lt;http://sentra.ischool.utexas.edu/~lcr/ archive/landc-toc-v33-no4.php&gt;, visited April 2008). Zeller found much in common in the approaches of the two contemporaries, though followers of Greg might find more correspondence between Grumach's views and those of R. B. McKerrow, at least in the matter of copy-text choice, since, in Zeller's description, Grumach used revised editions as copy-texts for the two works he edited (the epics Reinecke Fuchs and Hermann und Dorothea ). Zeller's main reason for pairing Greg and Grumach, however, seems to have arisen from the willingness of both editors to draw readings from different authoritative documents to serve their goal of an authorially in- tended critical text. Zeller's theory of insular documentary-based versions prevented him from endorsing their approaches, which he equated with "contamination"—the term used in the editing of ancient texts to indicate the classic problem of a single document carrying variants from alternate traditions and so resistant to stemmatic classification. Despite his rejection of the logic of Greg's rationale, Zeller did state the editorial problems of modern literature with admirable clarity, and was especially helpful in stressing that modern works could survive in multiple versions. A weakness for exaggeration sometimes misdirected attention when an issue of importance was being discussed: it is unhelp- ful, for example, to consider the "editorial principle of final authorial intention" in light of Zeller's suggestion that its "logical conclusion" would be the "annihilation" of works such as The Aeneid , whose authors willed that they be destroyed. 33 33. Zeller, op. cit., p. 243; the source Zeller cites, the Vita Vergilii of Aelius Donatus (c. 350, which is thought to have been derived from a lost life by Suetonius), relates details of the 11-year (B.C.E. 30–19) composition history of The Aeneid , including Vergil's plans to revise and complete the work, and his sudden illness which thwarted them. As he was dying he is supposed to have asked his friends to burn the scrolls, but they refused; after he died friends Varius and Tucca, encouraged by Augustus, published the unfinished work against the author's wishes. Some of these details are supported by near-contemporary sources. Zeller further men- tions Max Brod's denial of Kafka's wishes that Der Prozess be destroyed (ibid., p. 243 n. 19). Interesting as it is to read about the last wishes of some authors to have their papers destroyed, such stories turn on a different meaning of the word "intentions" than the one that is relevant to critical editing; obviously, an editor is concerned with author's creative intentions for a work. The belief that "final intention" must mean the author's last expressed wishes for his or her work has proved to be a persistent one. Certainly when J. P. Postgate spoke in 1911 of the "ul- timate intention" of Marlowe with respect to the variants of the widely divergent 1604 and 1616 versions of Doctor Faustus , something like last (known) wishes was meant (see note 27); instructions to destroy works, however, are rarely of use to the editor of a critical text. Zeller's view that each variant document (and even each layer of alteration on each document), constitutes a discrete version, was in part a reaction to his mistaken belief that the Greg-Bowers approach held either a "morpho- logical" or "teleological" view of literary works. 34 34. Zeller, op. cit., p. 242. These notions—which seem suggestive of a work of art perfecting itself (or maturing), in a ba- sically involuntary natural or philosophical movement—are of course foreign to modern scholarly editing. Yet few would deny, as Zeller seems to do categorically, the existence of an artistic process, in which artists develop works, with one or another degree of deliberation, toward points of completion. It is a process that most would agree can be revived, in pursuit of a revised end. Whether all the development within this process is constructive, or should be described as progress, are not strictly edito- rial questions, though they will likely demand the attention of the editor of a modern work, at least when it comes to deciding which point of the process should be the object of the attempted reconstruction. For Zeller, however, authors' interest in perfecting their works, or their response to others' suggestions or demands, are, in the distinction he draws, matters for literary rather than textual analysis. The editor's job as he sees it is limited to recounting the history of the work in its versions and selecting the version to be presented as the critical text, which is defined as the text of a particular document, cleared by the editor of simple errors. He criticizes attempted reconstructions that purport to go beyond particular documents, to reflect the author's uncompromised intentions. His reasons are clearly stated: referring to Fredson Bowers's relatively straightforward restorations in The Blithedale Romance of manuscript deletions of a few ref- erences to liquor and sex, Zeller writes, "I find the idea perplexing, that the editor should feel obliged not only to make inferences about the final intentions of an author, but also about the causes behind these intentions. I cannot regard the psyche of an author and its analysis as a substantial foundation for editing." 35 35. Zeller, op. cit., p. 246; Bowers reasonably believed that Hawthorne made these dele- tions at the behest of his wife ( The Blithedale Romance and Fanshawe , The Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Volume 3, ed. William Charvat, Roy Harvey Pearce, Claude M. Simpson, Fredson Bowers, Matthew J. Bruccoli, and L. Neal Smith [Ohio State Univ. Press, 1964], pp. 1, lii–liii). This remark is more consistent with Zeller's practical recommendations than is his earlier avowal of the goal of an authorially intended text. The creative human mind does not always re- spect documentary boundaries. The original documentary record, never having been complete, is liable to have eroded by the time a work comes in for scholarly attention. Editors of modern works commonly seek to reconstruct texts of lost documents—fair-copy manuscripts, typescripts, proof sheets—from descendents and ancestors. Only by drawing readings from both an early printed edition and a draft manuscript, for example, can an editor reconstruct the text of the intervening lost authoritative document. In other words, for some historical purposes, only an eclectic text will answer. There are limits of course. Given his view of literary history as cut-and-dried matter, Zeller un- surprisingly found Bowers's treatment of Stephen Crane's Maggie espe- cially untenable. Maggie is uncharacteristic of Bowers's work in that it comes dangerously close to breaching the historical limits that give criti- cal editing its essential meaning. From a single round of revisions Crane made in the text of the privately printed 1893 version of his story for publication by D. Appleton in 1896, Bowers sought to preserve only what he regarded as "stylistic changes as well as literary improvements," while rejecting bowdlerizing changes the publisher had demanded. 36 36. Bowery Tales: Maggie and George's Mother , University of Virginia Edition of the Works of Stephen Crane, Volume 1, ed. Fredson Bowers, with an introduction by James B. Colvert (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1969), p. lxviii. For his critical reconstruction of The Blithedale Romance , Bowers believed he could reasonably restore three references to liquor and sex that were deleted in manuscript, on the grounds that, unlike the bulk of the alterations, these three did not reflect Hawthorne's own inclinations. They seem to have been made out of deference to polite taste (possibly as represented in the person of Sophia Peabody, Hawthorne's wife). A simple case like The Blithedale Romance , in which a few revisions seem clearly out of step with the rest, allow us to conceive of an author separately serving his or her own intentions and someone else's while engaged in a single round of revisions of a work. Bowers argued that two sets of intentions were also served in Crane's revision of Maggie , but the editor was unable to identify the two types of changes convincingly, as he had done for the Hawthorne work. The basis of his critical reconstruction was questioned, politely by Tanselle in "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," and more forcefully elsewhere. 37 37. See Hershel Parker, Flawed Texts &amp; Verbal Icons: Literary Authority in American Fiction (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1984), pp. 11–13, 39–40, and David J. Nordloh, "On Crane Now Edited: The University of Virginia Edition of The Works of Stephen Crane," Studies in the Novel 10 (Spring 1978): 103–119. His acceptance of the bowdlerized version of the ending of chapter 17 attracted particular unfavorable notice. One would have to assume that the evidence for alterations serving the pub- lisher's rather than Crane's intentions was in the toning down or removal of highly realistic language or subject matter—curse words, primarily, and, in chapter 17, Maggie's encounters with prospective customers. By restoring only some of these deletions in the critical text, Bowers seemed to negate the controls he had established for his reconstruction. Bowers called his critical text the "'ideal' text of Maggie as a literary fact, not a limited 'ideal' text either of the 1893 or of the 1896 edition." 38 38. Bowery Tales: Maggie and George's Mother , p. xcv. This statement is not worded very clearly, nor was its meaning clarified elsewhere in Bowery Tales , the volume containing the story, but it seems to indicate a belief that the critical text was an ideal reconstruction of the work as a whole, as opposed to a rendering of one or the other ver- sion. If this surmise about Bowers's meaning is accurate, then he was either basically confused on this occasion, or momentarily at odds with the general direction of the editorial tradition he was otherwise involved in upholding. Within the author-focused model, a critical text can be said to represent the work as a whole only when the evidence indicates a creative process defined by a single culminating point or when there is not enough evidence to do anything else. Otherwise, a critical text can only represent a particular moment in the history of the work. Bowers's Maggie was more truly an attempted reconstruction of a presumed, intermediary third version of the story, which, in the editor's view, existed once in the author's mind, but only there. It might, however, be recovered in the comparison of the text of the first edition with that of the revised one. The authorially intended text is often partly defined by the rejection of altera- tions made by or at the behest of publishers or their agents—especially those with the suspected purpose of censoring coarse language or sensitive subjects. Yet a scholarly editor must construct a critical text according to a viable historical hypothesis, whereby it is argued that the author intended for the work to take the chosen form at one time or another—though the factor of time cannot be defined too narrowly, since a particular version may have taken shape over an extended period. Bowers's claim for the critical text of Maggie indicates that he came to believe that Crane had corrected and improved the text according to his own tastes, quite apart from simultaneously fulfilling the bowdlerizing demands of his publisher (possibly with the assistance of Ripley Hitchcock, Appleton's editor). Had he neatly separated the bowdlerizations and the improvements, and ad- opted only the latter, his text might have attracted less criticism. Even better would have been a clear, convincing demonstration, if such were possible, that Crane had conceived of such a text. As it was, the edition of Maggie must be counted among those few early occasions when Bowers did seem to misrepresent the critically reconstructed text in metaphysical terms, as the definitive synthesis of a literary work's constituent histori- cal moments. Opponents of the "Greg-Bowers" editorial approach have tended to fix their arguments to these early missteps, allowing themselves thereby to miss a world of subsequent experience, in which editorial un- derstanding developed and matured. III Scholarly attempts to go beyond the texts of existing documents to- ward closer re-creations of what authors wanted have always provoked doubt and criticism. Those in the field of Anglo-American literature who have recently imagined the "hegemony of the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle re- gime" (to use a typical description), seem unaware that the controversy over editorial freedom and eclectic practices winds backwards in a cycle measured in centuries, even to the days of Poliziano and probably be- yond, wherein, furthermore, the favorable position has been less than dominant. 39 39. Quotation from W. Speed Hill, "English Renaissance: Nondramatic Literature," in Scholarly Editing , ed. D. C. Greetham (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1995), p. 219. An illuminating discussion of the innovative scholarship of the humanists Angelo Ambrogini, known as Poliziano (1454–94, also known by his Latin name, Politian), and Piero Vettori (1499–1585, a.k.a. Petrus Victorius) is now available to Anglophone readers in Glenn W. Most's welcome edition in translation of the landmark work by Sebastiano Timpanaro (1923–2000), La genesi del metodo del Lachmann: see The Genesis of Lachmann's Method (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 2005), pp. 46–50. Timpanaro's discussions of further editorial history are of course of equal value, each shedding light on particular questions while contributing to the work as a whole, which after all becomes an erudite and absorbing history of the tension between method and judgment in editing. Even the leveling of the charge of "Platonism" against edito- rial eclecticism is not a new pastime, as the experience of Bowers's first critical texts nearly half a century ago demonstrates. A few new features of the opposition to editorial eclecticism have been observed, including the belittlement of the author and the corresponding aggrandizement of non-authorial contributions to the text. The striking feature of much of the criticism, however, is the absence of careful analysis of editions and critical texts and the presence in its place of sweeping generalities, often cast in philosophical language, and leaning, to one or another degree, on jargon. The following crowded passage, taken from David Greetham's Theories of the Text , epitomizes most of the arguments. In terms of the dialectic structure of a textualized ideology, Greg-Bowers Platonism successfully suppressed some of the interests of its readers by co-opting them in a cognitive act of self-representation, exactly as Althusser suggests that ideology as cog- nition must do. The ideal reader, indeed the only functioning reader, of the eclectic, Platonic text, was one who accepted a Hegelian reconciliation of thesis and antithesis into the organicism of the Romantic artefact, held together by the single unitary consciousness of an originary creator. This reader was Hegelian in another sense too: such a reading assumed that the concrete manifestation of text, particularly in its social and cultural negotiations with scribes, compositors, publishers' editors, binders, booksellers, and so on, was merely the superstructure built on the base of the 'thought' (that is, intention) of the author." 40 40. D. C. Greetham, Theories of the Text (Oxford Univ. Press, 1999), p. 370. While it may not seem so at first glance, this passage is organized in a manner helpful to understanding the basic position held by many recent opponents of critical editing. The usual elements of the false image of the "Greg-Bowers" editorial approach are present: the Platonic and Roman- tic idealism, the overriding faith in the "single unitary consciousness of an originary creator" (i.e., the author), and the denial of the social dimension of texts. Yet Greetham goes beyond repetition of this often-seen litany, when he introduces a charge of Hegelianism, which, while surely sugges- tive to many readers of an intention to obfuscate matters, can be used to clarify a pervasive misunderstanding about textual criticism. Greetham describes the "Greg-Bowers" editorial approach as Hegelian in two ways. For the first he attempts to fit two familiar clichés used to describe the approach—the "Romantic" notion of the ideal text and its companion, the solitary genius creator—into the Hegelian dialectic. His second use of the description is the more telling. Accordingly, the reader imagined by the Greg-Bowers editor is one who accepts that literary works have their origins in the mind of the author, their material manifestations be- ing concrete extension ("superstructure") of the original notion (intension, "base"). Greetham attempts to identify traditional editorial approaches with "pure" Hegelianism, assuming that to those readers for whom Hege- lian dialectics is at all meaningful, the meaning is dependent on the great inversion accomplished by the Left Hegelians (Strauss, Bauer, Stirner, Feuerbach), and especially, of course, by Marx and Engels. The dialectic was not set aside in this inversion (except by Feuerbach), but its origina- tor's ideal starting point was repositioned as extension—as the historically determined outcome of being. Priority is granted not to the self-moving absolute idea, but to a dynamic material world—to concrete natural and anthropological reality. The assumption in Greetham's passage is that any viewpoint adopting a "pure" Hegelian dialectic—in which nature and society are mere developmental shadows of the unfolding idea—will be regarded as quaint or absurd. But absurdity more obviously attaches to the suggestions that the "Greg-Bowers" editors are wrong, and that the thoughts of the author somehow do not precede the physical records made of them. For those who accept the inverted or materialist dialec- tic, the real begins with the material, but it does not end there. The thoughts of the author, while not prior in an absolute sense, obviously precede the records that were made of them, though the records—e.g., paper and ink—are basically material in nature and the thoughts are not. While not images of their obviously posterior records, the thoughts, however, are images of prior experience of the natural and social world. The paper and ink display the markings needed for reconstituting these thoughts, and the fidelity of the representation is the concern of textual criticism. While the intellectual premises of traditional critical editing need not be explained within the framework of the historical materialist outlook, they are fundamentally historical in nature and consequently do not exceed the boundaries of philosophical materialism. An editor's personal endorsement of philosophical idealism, on the other hand, does not directly bear upon his or her reconstruction of a historical moment in the life of a literary work, since that activity is necessarily governed by the pertinent evidence and the soundness of the editor's judgment in working upon it. The ideal character of the reconstruction, furthermore, has to do with the nature of thought and language, and is not indicative of Platonic or Hegelian belief. 41 41. The charges of editorial Platonism, Romanticism, and Hegelianism are worth examin- ing for their attempt to supply theoretical justification for some commonly held misconceptions about traditional scholarly editing. Less worthy of examination is the larger context in which these charges appear, where, it must be said, an irresponsible attempt is made to link scholarly editing in the United States to the "neoconservativism" of the Reagan and Bush I eras. The author here strains to prove an affinity between "neocon" pronouncements about eternal values (which he seems to accept as sincere) with the supposed traditional editorial goal of the perfect text: "The appeal of Reagan and Bush on the one hand and textual idealism on the other was both Edenic and teleological: Edenic in that both invoked an uncorrupted pristine state of core 'values' before socialization and post-modernism had made all values contingent; and teleologi- cal in that both claimed to embody and complete an essentialism (Americanism, patriotism, and authoriality, intention), so that Reaganism and eclecticism could pass themselves off as the fulfilment of the Scriptures: an end to history. In the case of eclecticism, this was not just a metaphor—in the sense that Francis Fukuyama used the phrase as a defence of Reaganism and late capitalism …—but was concrete and practical as well. The eclecticists produced 'definitive' editions of works that would never have to be edited again; that is, the editions stood outside or beyond the history of their own making, of their own socialization" ( Theories of the Text , p. 372). To this is added an unsupported assertion about the government's preference for eclectic editorial methods, which supposedly provide a "long-term return, on their investment." It is perhaps symptomatic of the lack of seriousness with which this argument was assembled that no mention is made of the neocons' actual attempts—ostentatious talk about traditional values in education aside—to deprive scholarly editions of American authors of funding. In arguments asserting that author-focused editing proceeds from a belief in an ethereal perfect text, the eclectic critical text is not easily discernable. It is described falsely, as the embodiment of the editor's aes- thetic preferences—an ahistorical amalgamation of favorable readings taken from various sources. It should be not be necessary to repeat at this point that what is of concern to the author-focused editor are the prefer- ences of the author, and how they developed over time, and whether and where these conflicted with the preferences of others involved in copying, publishing, or performing the work being edited. The counter-arguments gather some force, perhaps, in the word "eclectic," which retains the ancient connotation of a selection of pleasing philosophical beliefs. One part of the connotation, selection, does apply to the editorial tradition, as G. Thomas Tanselle emphasized in his outstanding essay, "Editing with- out a Copy-Text." 42 42. "Editing without a Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography 47 (1994): 1–22, reprinted in Tanselle, Literature and Artifacts (Charlottesville: Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1998), pp. 236–257 (this collection is discussed in note 47). There editors were advised to serve their historical ends with critical texts wholly constructed by selecting readings from per- tinent sources, rather than emending a pre-existing copy-text. In reason- ing beyond the copy-text, a document that has often proved debilitating of editorial judgment, Tanselle was seeking to sharpen the historical focus of critical editing. With no particular document automatically determin- ing questionable readings, the editorial process remains keenly centered on the history of the work and the point in its development chosen as the object of the reconstruction. To say that this process is "eclectic" is simply an acknowledgment that in the effort to account for human intentions and frailties, and gaps and errors of all kinds, the critical reconstruction nec- essarily adopts a historical principle of greater compass than that which might be defined by the texts of particular documents. A generation earlier, Fredson Bowers, searching for a useful defini- tion of eclecticism, noted that in the "purest sense" the term described "any text admitting emendation of error," since the "principle of choice has been invoked." 43 43. Bowers, "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof 4 (1975): 31–76, quotation from p. 31. Aware of contemporary opposition to eclectic texts, however, Bowers recognized that what was at issue involved more than the correction of obvious typographical errors in a single document. "Re- marks on Eclectic Texts," the essay in which he expressed these thoughts, was therefore given over to discussing exemplary situations taken from British and American literary works dating from the end of the sixteenth to the end of the nineteenth centuries. The diverse examples—including works from Shakespeare, Beaumont-Fletcher-Massinger, Fielding, Haw- thorne, William and Henry James, and Stephen Crane—allowed Bow- ers to discuss the significance of eclectic editorial practices as they grew more complex along a range of single- and multiple-authority traditions. He recognized that editorial eclecticism had not gained general accep- tance at the time of his "Remarks" (1973), writing of the "rigid adherents of faithful reprints of one authority in American literature and among English scholars in relation to nineteenth-century works." 44 44. Ibid., p. 39 n. 14. On the other hand he noted that at the time, opposition to eclecticism did not extend to the works of Shakespeare. The source of the inconsistency—a failure to recognize that transmissional carelessness and intentional tampering could erode the authority of a work no matter what period it was created in—was well understood (if not always clearly explained or handled) by Bowers, who had scholarly familiarity with works of many centuries. As he acknowledged more than once, Bowers took his conception of "authority" from R. B. McKerrow, principally from Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare , which is to say that he agreed that authority came from the author. This definition, as we have seen, runs against recent attempts to extend the concept, and also contradicts attempted new interpretations of McKerrow's views. His views on this matter were, however, already clear enough when he made them explicit. His skepticism concerning the editorial ways of predecessors and contemporaries, furthermore, did not prevent him from distinguishing the text the author intended to publish (or have performed) from the existing, flawed testimony of it—the texts of documents. He wrote of documents "having" authority, and of the most authoritative document being that which in the editor's opinion must have deviated least from the author's autograph manuscript—the line of reasoning that led him to name and formalize the concept of "copy- text." He intended to emend this document, however, as he made clear in Prolegomena and even demonstrated in the two tantalizing appended pages from his projected edition of Richard the Third (to be based on the Folio text). The sources for the emendations would include authoritative docu- ments other than the copy-text and also early derived documents—since, as the author helpfully emphasized, for literature from remote periods these contain valuable early corrections (or endorsements) of doubtful readings. While sometimes viewed as having identified authority with its mate- rial (documentary) embodiments, McKerrow was aware of a less tangible essence of literary works. The conception of final authorial intention as expressed in Prolegomena —an imagined "fair copy, made by the author himself, of his plays in the form which he finally intended to give them" (p. 6)—did not equate an author's intended text with the text of any document existing or lost, including those inscribed by the author. In at- tempting to account for the obviously corrupt condition of certain printed Renaissance dramas, McKerrow explored the problem of control of the text in its manifold details, as it moves from copy to copy. In this context he had cause to discuss the relative merit of a fair copy of a draft manu- script made by a professional scribe, as opposed to the author, recogniz- ing in the problem both psychological and practical dimensions. It is, I think, most people's experience that they do not make perfect copies of their own work. Its familiarity causes one to pay less minute attention than one would to a strange piece of writing. One has perhaps in the first draft hesitated between two words or two forms of expression: in copying one accidentally goes back to the wrong one—or mixes the two up. One tries to improve as one writes; and the improvement clashes with something else that one has overlooked, and so on. And even harder than copying one's own draft is, I think, reading over the copy when finished—at least unless a considerable time has elapsed since it was written. Thus a writer's own fair-copy is perhaps on the whole likely to be somewhat less good than one made by a competent professional copyist and read over by the author, while at the same time one would expect it to be less legible. 45 45.

John Phil- lip Immroth, Great Bibliographers Series, No. 1 (Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1974), pp. 139–158, quotation from p. 146 of the reprint; McKerrow distilled this text (an address to the Bibliographical Society) from his series of Sandars lectures delivered at Cambridge Univer- sity in 1928, which were first published as edited by Carlo M. Bajetta in Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000): 1–66. In the Bajetta edition of the lectures, an expansive, illuminating discussion on the "common causes of errors in printed books" begins on p. 48. It is doubtful that even today's critics of the early hypotheses of McKerrow and Greg concerning the origins of the poorly printed plays would take issue with these seemingly self-evident observations. On the other hand, in pointing out the obvious practical difficulties of producing an accurate copy of a literary work, and recognizing that even (or especially) authors are prone to confusion and error when attempting to copy their own work, McKerrow called attention to something essential about the nature of the written language. To speak only of modern alphabetic writing, this consists of complex systems of signs representing single sounds, which are combined into groups representing words, and their nonverbal ap- purtenances, including inflection (emphasis) and pauses (punctuation), all further sequenced within longer syntactical constructions. In long written works these constructions are embedded within still larger arrangements created according to the author's greater expository, aesthetic, rhetori- cal, and logical purposes (whether or not these purposes are partially responses to the preferences or demands of others invested with a measure of influence or control over the text). At the most narrowly material level, the outcome is a great sequence of thousands or hundreds of thousands of letterforms, other symbols, and spaces. An author attempting to cre- ate a precise symbolic representation of his or her thoughts thus faces substantial practical difficulties, which also await anyone trying to make a faithful copy of the original. Yet these marks are intended to convey linguistic meanings, and while the meanings are not easily recollected without their corresponding marks, they have priority in relation to them. From an awareness of the linguistic and material complexities that make all texts difficult to control and vulnerable to unintended error, can follow the basic conceptual dis- tinction between documentary texts and the works they represent. This distinction makes the editorial goal of authorially intended texts under- standable, along with the need for judgment-based eclectic practice in order to attempt them. The distinction has been thoughtfully explored by G. Thomas Tanselle on many occasions, beginning as early as his 1981 essay "The Texts of Documents and the Texts of Works," 46 46. "Texts of Documents and Texts of Works" was first published as "Literary Editing" in Literary &amp; Historical Editing , ed. George L. Vogt and John Bush Jones (Lawrence: Univ. of Kansas Libraries, 1981), pp. 35–56. The original title was assigned to the author as his topic at the "Conference on Literary and Historical Editing," held at the University of Kansas in 1978; Tanselle later criticized the title of the conference and the topic titles as "misguided in sug- gesting that the nature of editing shifts at disciplinary boundaries" ("Historicism and Critical Editing," Studies in Bibliography 39 [1986]: 5). When he reprinted the essay as the prologue to his collection Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia for the Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia, 1990), pp. 3–23, he adjusted the title to reflect his own views. In the essay he argued that labeling a work "literary" or "historical" is an artifice which ought not bear on how it is edited; he continued by identifying the distinction between private papers and works intended for publication as having genuine editorial significance for editors in every discipline. and most memorably in his Rosenbach Lectures of 1987, widely known in their printed form, A Rationale of Textual Criticism . 47 47. Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1989. This subject is also discussed in many of the essays Tanselle reprinted in his collection Literature and Artifacts (see note 42), especially "Textual Criticism and Deconstruction" (pp. 203–235); others include "Libraries, Museums, and Reading" (pp. 3–23) and "Enumerative Bibliography and the Physical Book" (pp. 186– 199). Indeed, as the title of the collection emphasizes, the relationship between literary works and their artifactual representations is a unifying theme, an aspect of which is pursued in almost every essay (a point widely missed in a review appearing in Text 14 [2002], which attempted to criticize the book as themeless). In 2004 Literature and Artifacts was brought out in a superb Italian translation made by the late Luigi Crocetti (1929–2007), distinguished former librarian of the Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Firenze and Italian translator of the Dewey Decimal Classification System ( Letteratura e manufatti , introduzione di Neil Harris [Firenze: Le Lettere]). Tanselle's collection evoked an expression of deep appreciation from its eminent translator: "to be the translator of such a book has been for me a privilege: in its field it is [the] finest book I have ever read" (Luigi Crocetti to G. Thomas Tanselle, 2 April 2005). Crocetti, who became director of the restoration department of the Florence library when the Arno flooded in 1966, dedicated his translation to the "venerated memory of Roger Powell" (1896–1990), restorer of the Book of Kells and pioneer of the minimal intervention techniques of restoration whose efficacies received much confirmation in the aftermath of the flood. One of Tanselle's purposes has been to make plain that the term "verbal work" describes a fairly open concept, with a formally limitless chronology and content, while a docu- mentary text is a particular material object, created at a specific point or points in time. A second purpose has been to clarify the nature of verbal works using a comparison with works of the plastic arts: unlike paintings or sculptures, verbal works cannot be directly experienced by beholding material objects. Our experience of them does depend on documentary texts, which are material objects, and so may be appreciated for their physical appearance, and may contain illustrations and decorative fea- tures intended to be integral parts of the works they represent. The verbal work per se , however, is not a material object, nor is it communicated by purely sensational means. Comprehension is basically an intellectual pro- cess, which begins with a literal interpretation of the sequences of symbols as transmitted in the documents. These prompt the reader to recall the words and then re-imagine the thoughts of the author, but the potential for understanding is regulated from the beginning by the level of accuracy attained in the sequences of symbols. While the practical complexity of the written language is the cause of much error, it also provides textual criticism with one basis for the reason- able analysis of the text, whereby puzzling readings are either determined to be errors and possibly corrected, or endorsed as true. Questionable passages can be tested against expected linguistic patterns, by considering them in the light of literary factors such as meaning and prosody, or fac- tors relating to aspects of the physical document, including handwriting or typography, as well as the dimensions of the page or column. These factors are further considered within the context of what is known of the movement of the text from copy to copy or edition to edition. In reflect- ing on his restoration of the true name of Sextus Cloelius—a confederate of Cicero's enemy P. Clodius Pulcher—the late D. R. Shackleton Bai- ley reviewed the conflicting manuscript readings in Cicero's letters and speeches, in which the name appears mostly in forms either of Cloelius or Clodius. He noted that "[c]opyists were under no temptation to make 'Cloelius' out of 'Clodius'. The temptation was all the other way, espe- cially in view of the association of Sextus with P. Clodius Pulcher." 48 48. "Mumpsimus—Sumpsimus," Ciceroniana n.s. 1 (1973): 3–9, repr. in Selected Classical Papers (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1997), pp. 15–21, quotation from p. 17 of the reprint; the title refers to a traditional story discussed in the next paragraph, but also to "Sex. Clodius—Sex. Cloelius," the paper in which Shackleton Bailey first proposed Cloelius ( Classical Quarterly n.s. 10 [1960]: 41–42, repr. in Selected Classical Papers , pp. 13–14). In addition to the historical context—the association of the two like-named men—Shackleton Bailey attributed the error—Clodius for Cloelius—to the likelihood of "el" being miscopied as "d", rather than the other way around, and demonstrated that the archetype of the various witnesses must have contained forms for Cloelius. The title of the article in which this discussion appeared, "Mump- simus—Sumpsimus," makes a generally useful point about editing, in referring to the supposed riposte of an errant English priest on being corrected of his nonsensical misreading in Mass of the phrase, "quod in ore sumpsimus" (in the mouth we have taken): "I will not change my old mumpsimus for your new sumpsimus" (related by Richard Pace in 1517, as quoted in the OED ). Erroneous readings tend to live on after they have been conclusively disestablished, since they can usually claim what is sometimes (and misleadingly) referred to as "documentary authority." The presence of a reading in an authoritative document is obviously of basic editorial interest, but the term is a deceptive syllogism, since docu- ments can contain errors of every imaginable kind. Many of these can be detected and repaired by further editorial investigation, the outcome of which might be a defense of a variant reading present in an alternative document, or an editorial conjecture—a reading which, though not pres- ent any existing document, might be the author's own expression, recalled from oblivion by editorial erudition and brain power. Shackleton Bailey first published the evidence for his recollection of Cloelius in 1960; he wrote "Mumpsimus—Sumpsimus" in 1973, partly to record the subse- quent persistence of "Clodius" in editions of Cicero made by those who should have known better. W. W. Greg's warnings about the "tyranny" or "mesmeric influence" of the copy-text, well familiar to readers of Studies in Bibliography , are meant to teach the same lesson as the title of Shackleton Bailey's article, a coincidence indicating that, as Greg believed, general editorial principles belong to all historical periods. Hans Zeller's stricture, mentioned in section II, against editorial at- tempts to analyze authors' minds would attract many latter-day endorse- ments, but presumably from those who would reject the author focus of Zeller's editorial approach. The incongruity applies in both directions, since most author-focused editors assume their discipline has a psycho- logical dimension. The concept of authorial intention in editing involves the editor in an investigation of the author's mind, as well as of the minds of those involved in copying or publishing the author's work. There are, obviously, many potential limits on what can be known of the author's habits, artistic inclinations, and stylistic preferences, and a prudent edi- tor is always conscious of them. It is, however, in the nature of the edi- torial temperament to test those limits. In the editing of classical texts, one of the forms that the concept of authorial intention takes is known as usus scribendi , or the author's usual practice, a criterion for judging variants which has been worked since at least the days of Aristarchus. As with the example from Cicero of paleographic analysis, usus scribendi was developed by editors of works from the remote past, and then adopted by editors of literature of all periods. Whether called by its Latin name or not, it describes an important dimension in the evaluation of variant readings from alternate texts believed to have descended independently from a lost common ancestor. Given what is known, for example, of Mark Twain's early style and preferences, the doomed cat, sensing that she was about to be "et up" (rather than "eat up") was more likely to have been "a grabbling" (as opposed to "grabbing") for the flower pot from which "Fitz Smythe's Horse" was attempting to snatch her. 49 49. The sketch about a rival journalist's famished bay mare originally appeared in a "San Francisco Letter" to the Virginia City (Nev.) Territorial Enterprise , published between 16 and 18 January 1866. Though contemporary instances of the spelling "eat" pronounced as "et" have been discovered, Mark Twain demonstrably preferred "et," using it in both Roughing It and Huckleberry Finn: see Mark Twain's Writings: San Francisco, 1865–1866 , ed. Richard Bucci and Robert H. Hirst (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, forthcoming 2011). The pairs of vari- ants come from independent contemporary reprintings of a lost original printing, and it is nearly certain that only one is authoritative. In judging between them, a second criterion, related to usus scribendi , might also sug- gest itself to an editor: lectio difficilior potior —the more difficult reading is preferable. This criterion is likewise associated with the editing of older texts, but is equally valid for texts of all periods; it arises from the obser- vation that unusual expressions unfamiliar to copyists (or typesetters) are exposed to the danger of being miscopied or replaced by more common expressions, whether inadvertently or by interpolation. The difficult vari- ant, in other words, is more likely than the common one to be the original. The two criteria converge in the little example from Mark Twain, since the "author's usual practice" involved a wide vocabulary which included more than its share of uncommon words or phrases ( lectio difficilior ) . The convergence is useful to keep in mind, since in the classical field the op- posite observation about the two criteria has been made: that they work in different directions, and lead toward divergent results— usus scribendi , it has been said, moves an editor toward smoother, linguistically normalized texts, while lectio difficilior favors textual dissonance and idiosyncracy. 50 50. In a fine appreciation of the philological scholarship of Sebastiano Timpanaro, Paolo Mari cited Cesare Segre as the author of this observation. According to Mari, Segre wrote "il ricorso sistematico all' usus scribendi favorisce una ricostruzione del testo standard, cioè tendente all'omogeneità; mentre la fiducia nella lectio difficilior apre la strada a eccezioni e trasgressioni" ("systematic recourse to usus scribendi favors a reconstruction of the standard text, that is, one tending toward homogeneity; whereas faith in lectio difficilior opens the way to exceptions and transgressions") (P. Mari, "Il contributo di Sebastiano Timpanaro al metodo critico fililogico," in Per Sebastiano Timpanaro: Il linguaggio, le passioni, la storia , a cura di Franco Gallo, Giovanni Iorio Giannoli e Paolo Quintili [Milano: Edizioni Unicopli, 2003], p. 53 n. 68). For lectio difficilior , Timpanaro stressed Giorgio Pasquali's warning to scholars that the concept of dif- ficulty must be understood historically: "facile e difficile non sono termine assoluti, e quel che è difficile, cioè inconsuetò, per noi, può essere stato facile per uomini di altre età" (quotation from Pasquali, Storia della tradizione e critica del testo , 2nd ed. [1952; Firenze: Le Monnier, repr. Firenze: Le Lettere, 1988, 2003], p. 123; for Timpanaro's remark, see The Genesis of Lachmann's Method [cited in note 39], p. 137). This opposition can also be observed in very recent texts, as when Bow- ers, who used both criteria (though perhaps without awareness of their Latin names) when he edited Stephen Crane, came upon "glintered" and "glinted" in alternate authoritative texts. He chose the more common variant, and thus usus scribendi over lectio difficilior , since he was unable to locate in Crane another example of "glintered." The dissatisfaction he expressed over his choice almost certainly arose from his awareness of Crane's preference for unusual words and spellings. 51 51. Tales of War , University of Virginia Edition of the Works of Stephen Crane, Volume 6, ed. Fredson Bowers, with an introduction by James B. Colvert (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1970), pp. 39, 319. Paleographic analysis, lectio difficilior , and usus scribendi have been widely applied in the editing of works from all periods, though their mer- its and limitations tend to be most actively discussed by editors of an- cient works. Like bibliographic analysis (of manuscripts as well as printed books), methods of linguistic study use the physical evidence of particular documentary texts, along with the general properties of the written lan- guage and the means by which it is conveyed, to understand the inten- tions and actions of those who created the documents—the author as well as others involved in copying or publishing the work. Intention is a basic editorial issue, since linguistic complexity makes control of the text hard to achieve. The obligations of the scholarly editor, whether in reconstructing the archetype of an ancient work or a point in the history of a modern one, are to understand these intentions and actions as far as possible, and divulge the results of the analyses that have been under- taken. These obligations would extend, furthermore, to the hypothesized social textual edition as well, since the goal of such an edition no less than an author-centered one would be to lay bare the details of the collabora- tive and conflicting relationships of the principals involved in the early performance or publication of the work. IV Since critical editing had its beginnings in the treatment of works from the remote past, for which authoritative evidence is comparatively slight, editors who began the process of applying scholarly methods to more recent works were faced with some problems of adaptation. Means for handling more evidence from authors' times had to be developed, but more obviously the critical text had to be redefined with greater preci- sion, so that unmistakable was its status as a conjectural reconstruction of a single moment in the life of a work that in its totality may be defined by several recoverable moments. The historical focus of the critical text, that is, must narrow and sharpen as the level of original evidence rises; it must not be conceived of or presented as a supra-historical synthesis of the work as a whole—as Bowers had mistakenly done when he edited Maggie . Time was needed for the historical purpose of critical editing to reassert itself in its new surroundings. After Greg's examples of autho- rial revision in "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Bowers, fresh from his experience editing the dramatic works of Thomas Dekker, pushed un- derstanding forward in "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered." 52 52. Fredson Bowers and Alice Walker, "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," Shakespeare Quarterly 6 (Summer 1955): 309–324; the paper includes Bowers's discussions annotated with commentaries by Alice Walker, who had been McKerrow's assistant in the projected Oxford Shakespeare. Here Bowers indicated that a dramatic work could have several "final" forms, prepared for either literary publication or stage pre- sentation. He recognized that the critical text would aim at reconstructing one of these versions, with the variants of the others recorded in the ap- paratus. Shakespeare critics usually identify performing versions by their comparative brevity, and few editors—Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, and their associates of the Complete Oxford Shakespeare being the notable exceptions 53 53. The Complete Oxford Shakespeare (Oxford: Clarendon Press) consists of the follow- ing volumes, all edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor (general editors) and John Jowett and William Montgomery (editors): William Shakespeare: The Complete Works (1986; rev. ed., 2005); William Shakespeare: The Complete Works, Original-Spelling Edition (1986); and William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (1987; rev. ed., W. W. Norton, 1997), a critical apparatus meant to serve both the old- and new-spelling versions. —have been willing to set aside suspected authorial passages in order to present the cut-down theatrical version. While Bowers (like McKerrow) was with the editorial majority in his orientation toward re- constructing the fuller versions, his method called for careful investigation of the sources of variation. In a few multiple-authority plays of Shake- speare, certain passages are not present in both or all three sources, giving rise to questions of who made the cuts, and why: whether they were made, for example, to serve the (potentially related) interests of dramatic struc- ture and theatrical performance. The questions sorely test the evidence in Shakespeare, but their difficulty does not alter the fact that they are of basic interest to the author-centered editor. In light of the foregoing consideration it becomes apparent that an em- phasis on performing versions of plays—such as that exhibited by Wells, Taylor, and associates—while requiring uncommon editorial choices, does not carry an editor as far from the tradition of Greg and Bowers as the tenor of recent editorial disputes would suggest. The distinction between social, collaborative, or performing texts on the one hand and authorially intended texts on the other has been drawn so starkly in re- cent times that the two sides are at best thought of as mutually exclusive alternatives. Logic and experience, however, suggest a less than absolute divide, which varies from situation to situation. The possibility of con- structing an authorially intended critical text is unaffected, for example, by the matter of whether the work being edited has one author or several: collaborated works have been the object of this approach since Bowers's edition of Dekker. 54 54. The first volume of The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1953) included Dekker's addition to Sir Thomas More , the second volume (1955) included The Honest Whore , part 1 (by Dekker and Thomas Middleton), and the third volume (1958) included The Roaring Girl (Dekker and Middleton), The Virgin Martyr (Dekker and Philip Massinger), and The Witch of Edmonton , for which Dekker was one of at least three authors. Wells and Taylor and their colleagues have been criti- cized for their belief that the shorter versions of Shakespeare's plays were made either by the author or by others with his approval, in the pur- pose of improving their "overall structure and pace.…" 55 55. William Shakespeare: The Complete Works (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. xxxv of the introduction by Stanley Wells. In a lengthy review of this (modern-spelling) volume appearing in Review of English Studies (n.s. 40 [August 1989]: 402–411), Brian Vickers held that the theatrical preferences of Wells and his colleagues were not expressed consistently throughout their editions nor justified with consistent logic. Vickers pointed out that the editors ascribe the same variants (as in the two hundred lines missing from the Folio but present in the Q2 version of Hamlet ) here to the demands of performance and there to Shakespeare's artistic second thoughts. Paul Werstine has also criticized the Oxford editors' approach for seeking to present texts as "collaboratively reworked for performance" while attempting to retain an authorial focus (see "Shakespeare," Werstine's contribution to Scholarly Editing , pp. 270–271). The categories identified by these critics are not necessarily mutually exclusive, though ques- tions of revision in Shakespeare will remain open barring the (unlikely) discovery of decisive new evidence. The criticism has come, not surprisingly, from both traditional Shakespeareans and those caught in the prevailing current of questioning the importance or even the existence of authors. 56 56. In his "Shakespeare" essay in Scholarly Editing , Paul Werstine writes of the Oxford edi- tors' notion of Shakespearean revision as "popular … among many who cling to the category of author." Elsewhere he refers to the Oxford editors' "repeated invocation of the 'sovereign author' as their foundation" being insufficient, in view of the performing versions presented as the main texts, to satisfy reviewers such as David Bevington, G. Blakemore Evans, and George Walton Williams, "for whom the rhetoric of authorship is still viable" (quotations from pp. 269–271). The evidence for or against the presence of authorial revision in Shakespeare is scant and much in dispute, but where authorial revision has been reasonably hypothesized, nothing prevents an author-focused editor from constructing critical texts of the revised versions. On this subject, it is worth remembering that Greg for- mulated his ideas on copy-text in response to the problem of authorial revision. As works created in ever more recent periods began to draw editorial attention, the levels of evidence encountered demanded critical texts and apparatuses with an increasingly precise historical focus. The widest edi- torial experience in modern letters has been gained with the works and papers of American authors; results have been uneven, but in places the field has given bloom to sound, exciting scholarship. Reference to a few exemplary bright spots will, it is hoped, serve to indicate the dimensions of the editorial experience of recent works, for which multiple signifi- cant moments are recoverable. Here comparatively plentiful evidence of composition and printing history, while never amounting to a complete record, throws into relief a range of textual problems that remain mostly hidden for literature from more remote times. The detection of errors remains of primary importance in the editing of modern works, but clari- fication of the history of the intentional alteration of the text becomes an equally important objective. The authorial orientation of the traditional approach can and should concentrate editorial attention on the interests of others involved in the publishing process as well as on the trajectory of the author's changing intentions. Editors of modern works soon become familiar with a great range in the sources of alteration, including purely authorial revision, the author's acceptance of the suggestions of an invited reader, his or her acquiescence to the textual demands of others whose approval was needed for publication or performance, and the imposition of publishing- or printing-house styles in matters of spelling, punctuation, or even grammar. The many colorfully worded complaints about printers and proof-readers made by exacting writers like Mark Twain and A. E. Housman attest to their keen interest in textual control, the satisfactory attainment of which eluded their most diligent efforts. 57 57. A typical example of Housman's many attempts at textual control is his letter of 28 August 1911, to friend and publisher Grant Richards, concerning the manuscript of his Manilius II, which reads in part: "On former occasions the proofs have come to me full of the usual blunders,—numerals wrong, letters upside-down, stops missing, and so on. I have then, at the cost of much labour, removed all these errors. Then, when the last proof has left my hands, the corrector for the press has been turned on to it, and has found nothing to correct; where- upon, for fear his employers should think he is not earning his pay, he has set to work meddling with what I have written,—altering my English spelling into Webster's American spelling, my use of capitals into his own misuse of capitals, my scientific punctuation into the punctuation he learnt from his grandmother" (quoted in Richards, Housman: 1897–1936 [London: Oxford Univ. Press, Henry Milford, 1941], p. 102). For Mark Twain, see Robert H. Hirst, "Editing Mark Twain, Hand to Hand, 'Like All D—d Fool Printers'" ( Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 88 [June 1994]: 157–188); there Hirst remarked, "Clemens's persistent efforts to wrest control of his punctuation and spelling back from the typesetter make W. W. Greg's theory of copy-text an ideal instrument for editing his published works, especially since in spite of those efforts, Clemens rarely prevailed over the printer for long" (p. 159). As an example of the problems the author encountered, Hirst called attention to his unhappy experience with the typesetting of The Prince and the Pauper , which Mark Twain called a "mess of God-forever-God-damned lunacy" that "has turned my hair white with rage." He was so upset that he told the publisher of his politely written novel to send him no more proof "until this godamded idiotic punctuating &amp; capitalizing has been swept away &amp; my own restored" (see the University of California edition of The Prince and the Pauper [cited in note 66], pp. 392ff.). The frustrations of Housman and Mark Twain illustrate the intractability of the problem of transmissional control, since these authors were known to have uncommon influence with their publishers. The point at which authors seem finally to accept the alterations of others does not necessarily or even usually equate with the editorial idea of authorial intention, and scholarly editors who focus on the latter are justified, evidence permitting, in reconstructing texts as they stood be- fore being so altered. This was the course followed by Harrison Hayford, Hershel Parker, and G. Thomas Tanselle, editors of the Northwestern- Newberry Typee (1968), when they presented a critical text of Melville's story repaired of the textual contributions and subtractions which had been forced upon the author by his American publisher, John Wiley of Wiley &amp; Putnam. 58 58. Herman Melville, Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life , ed. Harrison Hayford, Hershel Parker, G. Thomas Tanselle, with a historical note by Leon Howard, The Writings of Herman Melville (Evanston and Chicago: Northwestern Univ. Press and Newberry Library, 1968); for discussions of printing and revision history, see "Editorial Appendix." See also: Melville to Evert A. Duyckinck, 15? July 1846 and 30? July 1846, in Herman Melville, Correspondence , ed. Lynn Horth, The Writings of Herman Melville (Evanston and Chicago: Northwestern Univ. Press and Newberry Library, 1993), pp. 52–53, 60–61; Hershel Parker, Herman Melville: A Biography, vol. 1, 1819–1851 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press), pp. 404–406, 433, 440–448. Typee presents, for Melville's works, a textual situation of un- usual complexity, and though the volume was the first in the Northwestern- Newberry edition, it comes very close to providing a model of historical editing. The first American edition of Typee (A), hurriedly set from proof sheets of the English edition (E), suffered not only from careless typeset- ting but also from small changes apparently made by Wiley, who softened language or gouged out passages that offended him. Some months later, seizing upon Melville's modest suggested alterations (and restorations) for a revised edition, Wiley demanded of him a thorough cleansing of most wording touching on sexual and religious matters. Melville had little choice but to acquiesce, and so the American revised edition (AR), while containing some authorized changes (including "The Story of Toby"), is chiefly distinguished by euphemizing corruptions and missing passages. After analyzing this history, the editors decided to construct a critical text which referred to the moment when Melville submitted his changes to Wiley. The decision was motivated neither by aesthetic considerations nor personal preferences (accusers of editorial "Platonism" take note), but by an interest in carrying out, as far as the evidence permitted, the author's last known wishes for his work. The decision of course also meant the denial of Wiley's wishes, and so as is often true of author-centered critical texts, the outcome of an earlier, coerced agreement of publisher over author would be reversed. The editors' goal was ambitious given the limits imposed by the available evidence (rich as this evidence might seem to an editor of works from the remote past). The complete loss of Melville's final manuscript 59 59. One leaf of an intermediate-level manuscript (two MS pages) was available to the editors. A few more leaves of this MS were discovered in 1983; all are now in the Gansevoort- Lansing Collection of the Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library. was one obvious limitation, and another was the near complete absence of evidence of the early revisions made by the author's brother, who in London arranged for first publication, as well as of those of John Murray, publisher of that first, English, edition, and Henry Milton, Murray's reader. The editors began with E, the earli- est extant complete authoritative text, but this text already incorporated more than one level of non-authorial alteration. As often happens in lit- erary archaeology, several earlier moments in the history of a work were found in E, but in a collapsed state. Only the last of these moments was meaningfully visible; from internal and external evidence the erstwhile existence of the earlier moments could be recognized, but little could be done further to distinguish them. The editors restored American spellings to some "our/or" words, 60 60. The editorial approach of the Northwestern-Newberry edition of Melville, like that of most scholarly editions of American authors, explicitly involved following Greg's recom- mendation for designating a copy-text in all situations. For Typee , the first English edition was the only possible choice according to this criterion, since the first American edition was derived from that typesetting. The complexity of the editorial goal, however, which sought, for example, to incorporate Melville's known preference for mainly American spelling, made the concept of a copy-text problematic, as the editors acknowledged at the time (on p. 320 of the Northwestern-Newberry Typee ). This experience may have contributed to Tanselle's ulti- mate critique of Greg's copy-text, which appeared twenty-five years later as the essay, "Editing without a Copy-Text" (see note 42). but made little headway in identifying what had been altered, let alone recovering Melville's original version. In A, on the other hand, Wiley's depredations were easily identifiable, both because enough evidence survived and Wiley's interest was understood (illustrating not only the editorial relevance of psychology, but also the author-focused editor's appreciation of the intentions of persons other than the author). Thus were some substantive variants in the first Ameri- can edition identified as Wiley's work; as for what Melville called the " Revised … Expurgated?" edition (AR), the editors subjected this text to much analysis. In addition to the thorough bibliographic examination of AR, aesthetic, social, and psychological factors were taken into account, with the result that the editors were able to distinguish, in the matter of the substantives at least, some or all of Melville's earlier, uninfluenced revisions from those Wiley had forced upon him. 61 61. The Melville quotation is from the second letter to Evert Duyckinck cited in note 58. According to Wiley's demands, nearly thirty pages of text were wholly excised for the revised edition, parts of eighteen pages were also removed, and many other passages or words were modified (such as "Naked" to "Lovely"). Yet the revised edition also included "The Story of Toby" (which Melville was able to write once his lost island companion, Richard Tobias Green, surfaced in Buffalo), as well as the less obvious changes that Melville made to the first edition before Wiley made his demands. The editors identified the word "liberally," for example, as a correction of "literally," in reference to a loose translation of Marquesan speech, reasoning that the British compositor, in puzzling through Melville's cramped handwriting, misread 't' for 'b', an error repeated in the derivative first American edition, where the author finally noticed it. (The editors also identified and deciphered a few misreadings of his handwriting that Mel- ville missed; their restoration of "Lacedemonian matrons" is very fine: see the Northwestern- Newberry Typee , p. 332). The role and importance of the critical text has rarely received so dramatic a demonstration as it does in the scholarly edition of Melville's Typee . The evidence presented there concretely reveals that the two first editions imperfectly represented Melville's early intentions (E a good deal less imperfectly than A), and that the revised edition clearly betrayed his later ones. These pre-existing documentary texts, records of the author's interactions with his publishers and first readers, are of permanent and undeniable value. Yet few would deny equal value to the constructed critical text, which convincingly approaches the Typee that Melville at last wanted. The totality of the evidence displayed by the scholarly edition, in- cluding the critical reconstruction of the finally intended text, heretofore denied the author and his readers by contingent factors no longer obtain- ing, allows for the study of the recoverable life of this work through its development. Careful review of the Northwestern-Newberry Typee should give pause to those who profess that author-centered editing is ignorant of either the "instability" of literary works or their social context. The editors of Typee had little choice but to accept the early alterations of Melville's brother and his publisher, since evidence enough survived to know that they were made, but not enough to identify them. When the details of an author's interactions with contributors are known to an edi- tor, criticism becomes unavoidable. Unconsidered endorsements of the "social text" sometimes assume that all nonauthorial contributions, once identified, are rejected by an editor taking an author-centered approach. This assumption proceeds, however, from far too abstract a view of the authorial focus. Welcome verbal (and pictorial) contributions to literary works made by persons other than the author have usually been endorsed by traditional critical editions. The works of Mark Twain offer many examples of collaborative relationships in which the author was a will- ing partner. He wanted his books to be illustrated, and invited artists to depict scenes of their own choosing, and his publishers' agents to select or create captions for them. Intolerant as he was of unsolicited printing- house alterations of his manuscripts, he sought textual advice from friends and family members whose literary talents or ear for coarse language he valued. Charles Henry Webb assembled and edited the sketches for The Celebrated Jumping Frog (1867); Bret Harte criticized the manuscript of The Innocents Abroad (1869), and Olivia Langdon, then the author's fiancée, read the proofs—thereby beginning a lifetime of service to the literature of her husband-to-be; Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) received read- ings from both William Dean Howells and Mrs. Clemens. Where the per- tinent evidence survives, it usually shows an inclination on Mark Twain's part to accept the suggestions of his readers. The author was aware that his vivid use of English was ahead of prevailing notions of politeness, and while he wanted to test those notions, he did not want far to exceed them. The nature and limits of the counsel he willingly followed in this area is explored fairly thoroughly in the volumes of the University of California edition of Mark Twain's works. The author's relationships with his arbi- ters of taste could be lively, as an outstanding episode in the history of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) reveals. The details are fully discussed in the California scholarly edition, edited by Bernard L. Stein and his colleagues at the Mark Twain Papers. 62 62. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court , The Works of Mark Twain, ed. Bernard L. Stein, with an introduction by Henry Nash Smith (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1979). It was a controversy which, in the editor's words, reproduced "in miniature one of the crucial issues in the nineteenth-century debate over realism." 63 63. Ibid., p. 657. Connecticut Yankee received readings from Mrs. Clemens (manuscript), W. D. Howells (proof), and, in between, from poet and chronicler of American literature Edmund Clarence Stedman (typescript). Not quite an invited contributor, Stedman was foisted upon the author by nervous first-time publisher Fred Hall—though once arrangements were made, Mark Twain welcomed his involvement. Stedman professed deep admira- tion for the novel, but a studied commitment to respectability prevented him from letting pass an opportunity to warn the author that others might not understand the book as he did. In keeping with his assignment, he suggested a few minor changes of a polite nature, which Mark Twain duly accepted. The author probably accepted most of Howells's suggestions too, though this is a guess, since the proof sheets that Howells read and marked are lost—with one spectacular exception. A single sheet from the novel's conclusion (ch. 43, "The Battle of the Sand-Belt") preserves printed and holographic evidence of the author's struggle, in November 1889, with one of Howells's queries. In the printed text of the sheet, the Yankee's "head executive," Clarence, enlightens his boss by imagining the reaction of the commander of the royalist insurgency after a messenger reads him the Yankee's order to surrender: "'Disembowel me this animal, and convey his kidneys to the base-born knave, his master; other answer I have none!'" 64 64. This quotation and the others from the tell-tale proof sheet appearing below it were transcribed from the reproduction in the California Connecticut Yankee , pp. 545–546. At the time the scholarly edition appeared, the original document was part of the Estelle Doheny Collec- tion of rare books and manuscripts housed at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, California; the collection was sold at auction in six sales held from 1987 to 1989. Howells found this language too strong, a reaction he registered by underlining, more or less, the first eight words, and writing a question mark in the margin. Mark Twain responded by inscribing the following message on the sheet, which he then sent to his publisher: Dear Mr. Hall: Submit this sentence (underlined by Howells,) to Stedman. I strenuously object to modifying it—in fact it is already modified, for the man would have said guts—but if Stedman sides with Howells I will yield. In that case, return it to me for alteration. S L C Hall returned the sheet inscribed with a note of his own: "Mr. Stedman says that this is stronger as it is, but that it had better be changed, he suggests the words 'Disembowel' &amp; 'Kidneys' might offend some." The sheet also bears Stedman's attempt to revise the offending sentence, which reveals that he objected also to the word "knave": "Cleft Cleave me this man in twain, &amp; convey his lights (?) to the the base-born hind, his, etc." Mark Twain, good to his word, returned the sheet again, now inscribed with his final note: Dear Mr. Hall: I yield. Make it read thus: "Dismember me this animal, &amp; return him in a basket to the base-born knave his master; other answer I have none!" S.L.C. Nov. 14. The first American edition, which went to press a few days after Mark Twain wrote this last note, followed the instruction but further substituted "who sent him" for "his master", possibly without authorization. The scholarly critical text followed the instructions in the last note ex- actly, though it would have been within its purposes to preserve the earlier and more vivid expression, given Mark Twain's strongly stated prefer- ence for it. On the other hand, the caution governing this decision likely arose from an awareness of the particular circumstances under which this work was first produced. Compared to the author of Typee before him or of Maggie after, Mark Twain was in an unusually powerful position. He could take or leave requests coming from the publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, because he was its senior partner. As for the recommendations of his wife or best friend, these were freely asked for, freely given, and not binding. The author was more or less at liberty to follow his own artistic lights, but knowing that in places these burned too brightly for the times, was willing to accept moderating advice from trusted sources in the matter of potent words and phrases. About Adven- tures of Huckleberry Finn , for example, he told Charles L. Webster, "I want Howells to have carte blanche in making corrections." 65 65. Mark Twain to Charles L. Webster, 22 April 1884, MS at Vassar, repr. in Mark Twain, Business Man , ed. Samuel Charles Webster (Boston: Little, Brown, 1946), pp. 249–250. Evidence of the contributions of Howells, Mrs. Clemens, or others to the texture of Mark Twain's prose, and the author's reactions to them, has rarely survived in so dramatic a form as the tell-tale proof sheet from Yankee . Yet whatever form it takes, surviving evidence of the give and take between author and invited reader has little caused the editors of the University of California edition to go back on the author's original decisions. 66 66. The salient exception is, of course, the portion of chapter 16 of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn known as the "raftsmen's passage," which, at Charles L. Webster's suggestion and with the author's agreement, was kept out of the novel as first published. For discussion of its inclu- sion in the University of California's critical text, see pp. 407–409 and 705–711 of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , The Works of Mark Twain, ed. Victor Fischer, Lin Salamo, and Walter Blair (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2003). The editors of the critical edition have more commonly endorsed Mark Twain's acceptance of collaborative contributions, as the example of The Prince and the Pauper demonstrates. With this novel, Mark Twain's intermittent interest in pleasing those of genteel taste—in this case, his Hartford neighbors—reached its apogee. In the words of Kenneth R. Andrews, who first extensively discussed the subject, "The Prince and the Pauper … became, more than any other book of Mark's, the product of community collaboration" (Andrews, Nook Farm: Mark Twain's Hartford Circle [Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1950], p. 192). Mark Twain described this work as "grave &amp; stately … considered by the world to be above my proper level" and wanted to publish it anonymously, to avoid prejudice. In keeping with his intention, he sought criticism from an unusual number of readers, including Howells, the journalist Edward H. House (who was also an English history buff), his own and others' children, and two Hartford preachers. The editors of the California scholarly edition found that apart from resisting some suggestions of his two Puritan-critics, the author accom- modated most of his readers' advice. At Howells's suggestion he removed the "whipping-boy's story" (which Howells had described as "poor fun"), and made about thirty smaller moderating changes, which the editors identified by collating sales prospectuses and carefully examining copies of the first edition for evidence of plate alterations: see The Prince and the Pauper , The Works of Mark Twain, ed. Victor Fischer, Lin Salamo, and Mary Jane Jones (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1979), pp. 4–7, 393–401. The author's much different reaction to the un- solicited printing-house alterations of this novel's accidentals is recorded in note 57. Though today we are keenly interested in Mark Twain's original language, he, it must be recognized, had a genuine disinclination to inflame public sentiments uselessly (as he saw it) by a few casually chosen words and phrases. He admitted to having "dug out" and "throttled" most of his own "darlings" from A Connecticut Yankee , but felt nonetheless that Howells's help was needed to complete the job; this feeling can be (and generally has been) regarded as part of his artistic intentions. 67 67. Mark Twain to W. D. Howells, 5 August 1889, MS at Harvard, repr. in The Mark Twain—Howells Letters , ed. Henry Nash Smith, William M. Gibson, and Frederick Anderson, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press, 1960), vol. 2: 608–609; the wider context of the quoted words helps reveal the extent and limit of the author's willingness to make linguistic concessions: "If Mrs. Clemens could have sat down &amp; read the book herself, I could have got you off, maybe, but she has not had an hour's use of her eyes for reading since she had the pink-eye six months ago. So she is afraid I have left coarseness which ought to be rooted out, &amp; blasts of opinion which are so strongly worded as to repel instead of persuade. I hardly think so. I dug out many darlings of these sorts, &amp; throttled them, with grief; then Steadman went through the book &amp; marked for the grave all that he could find, &amp; I sacrificed them, every one." Discovery of the social context in which Mark Twain worked is one of the purposes of the scholarly edi- tion; the serving of this purpose rather clarifies than obscures the nature of the author's genius. The American experience has confirmed much past editorial wis- dom, but also demonstrated that in the approach to works represented by abundant original textual evidence, scholarly attention shifts: as sev- eral recoverable moments in the life of these works are recognized, the demand arises for critical texts of greater historical focus, accompanied by revealing historical apparatuses. The reasonableness of the traditional editorial emphasis on authors was repeatedly reconfirmed, finding new definition in authors' visible struggles with publishers over realistic scenes and language. These struggles also gave new meaning to the editorial concept of intention (and not only authorial intention). The relevance of this concept was further strengthened by a deeper understanding of the problem of textual control—a benefit derived from the ability to study multiple authoritative documents of the same work. These lessons were not learned everywhere and at once. Textual history that might have been understood was missed, and sometimes even deliberately simplified. The importance of revealing this history was overshadowed in places by the emphasis on establishing finally intended texts for works then avail- able only in bad editions, if at all. That the shelves of American libraries were being filled with reliable texts of the nation's literature—often for the first time—may have led some editors to regard the critical text as a metaphysical ideal, rather than a conjectural reconstruction of a par- ticular historical moment. (Certainly advertising departments of some of the participating university presses fostered such a viewpoint, with copy announcing sales of the "only authoritative" texts.) On the other hand, the historical purposes of scholarly editing did find many worthy demonstrations. In a classic appreciation of those purposes, Jo Ann Boydston, then editor of the John Dewey edition, spoke of the essential importance of the critical apparatus: "Every apparatus has a story to tell that is, like that of Dewey's Psychology , a story of suspense and discovery, a true textual drama." 68 68. "In Praise of Apparatus," Text 5 (1991): 1–13, quotation from p. 10; Boydston's remarks were first delivered in 1989, as the presidential address to the Society of Textual Scholarship. While the critical text of Dewey's Psychology presents the finally intended version (1891), the title of the scholarly volume containing this work emphasizes its 1887 beginning: The Early Works of John Dewey, 1882–1898, Volume 2: 1887 (ed. Jo Ann Boydston, intro. Herbert W. Schneider [Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1967]). Her edition of the work she names was purposefully designed to reveal a complex history of authorial revision. The result, which appeared in 1967, fulfills the promise of critical edit- ing: it presents a critical text of the work at the moment in 1891 when the author submitted final revisions to his publisher, and displays the other recoverable moments in the accompanying apparatus. Together, critical text and apparatus recount the motion of Dewey's early thought, as he began to modify a youthful Hegelian outlook. Far from obliterating dis- tinctions between the moments of literary history—in the service, as de- tractors would have it, of an idealistic abstraction—the well-constructed critical edition brings that history into view. When the editors are skilled, the history is presented truly and in a manner conducive of understand- ing; at this point, if the history remains obscure in places, it is owing to the limits of the preserved evidence, and the elusive relationship between thought and its records. SCRIBAL INTENTIONS IN MEDIEVAL ROMANCE: A CASE STUDY OF ROBERT THORNTON by John Ivor Carlson I. A Rationale of "Scribal Corruption"? Although codicologists have long been familiar with the tendency among medieval copyists to shape their texts through amateur editing, the recent popu- larity of critical approaches that treat books as social constructs has renewed and redirected interest in this fact. 1 1. Jerome McGann has been the most vocal proponent of this approach to textual scholar- ship in his work on nineteenth-century literature, although several medievalists including Tim Machan and D. C. Greetham have adapted his theories to codicology (Jerome J. McGann, A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism [Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1983]; Jerome J. Mc- Gann, The Textual Condition [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991]; Tim William Machan, "Late Middle English Texts and the Higher and Lower Criticism," Medieval Literature: Texts and Interpretation , ed. Tim William Machan, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 79 [Binghamton: MRTS, 1991]; David C. Greetham, Textual Transgressions: Essays toward the Construction of a Biobibliography [New York: Garland, 1998]). Traditional approaches to scribal intervention, characterized most often as tampering, are ubiquitous in modern critical editions like those produced by the Early English Text Society (see below for citations of some relevant EETS editions). Complexities introduced by independent-minded scribes, once approached solely as impediments to establishing archetypal read- ings, have now become a subject for analysis under broader interpretations of textual criticism. As Derek Pearsall notes, "scholars are learning the value of bad manuscripts: how in the work of interfering and meddling scribes, for instance, can be seen the activities of our first literary critics. The methods of compilers and manuscript editors of all kinds, whether professional or amateur, need to be studied, if we are to understand the reception and readership assumed for the literary works contained in their collections." 2 2. Derek Pearsall, "Introduction," Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England: The Literary Implications of Manuscript Study, Essays from the 1981 Conference at the University of York , ed. Derek Pearsall (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1983), 1–2 (p. 1). There are, of course, varying degrees of significance in scribal alterations and it would be misguided to ascribe literary import to every thoughtless error (see Robert Adams, "Editing Piers Plowman B: The Imperative of an Intermittently Critical Edition," Studies in Bibliography 45 [1992]: 31–68 [p. 33]). Sometimes, as in the case of Pearsall himself, this interest in scribal agendas has been presented as part of a wider critique of eclectic editing and its pursuit of authority. It stands to reason, though, that more precise knowledge about copying habits would be as much a boon to those seeking authorial readings as to their antagonists. 3 3. McGann himself implicitly endorses this opposition in his early writings, though not in regard to pre-print era texts specifically, and that antagonism becomes explicit in the work of Pearsall and others. It is interesting to note that, expanding upon his arguments over the years, McGann has endorsed a more conciliatory tone toward traditional eclectic editing and positioned his critical approach as more complementary than oppositional. Whatever a scholar's attitude toward the issue of intention, it is hard to take exception to calls for increased understanding of those who shaped the evidence with which every textual critic, whether a disciple of George Kane or Jerome McGann, must inevitably contend. 4 4. Although several other editors whose primary interest involves authorial intention might just as easily been placed in juxtaposition to McGann here, George Kane's advocacy on behalf of the primacy of editorial judgment over documentary evidence when determining intention represents what is perhaps closest to an antithesis of the social construct theory (Wil- liam Langland, Will's Visions of Piers Plowman and Do-well , ed. and rev. George Kane [London: Athlone Press, 1988]). If a nearly universal desire for more thorough analysis of scribal intention can be taken as a given, the practicality of such study is far more problematic than many recent advocates of this methodology have been willing to admit. 5 5. It is perhaps telling that the number of polemics advocating a renewed focus on scribal intention and practice far exceeds the studies meeting those calls to action. Exemplary work has been produced, though, including the series of essays by Ralph Hanna III collected in his anthology Pursuing History: Middle English Manuscripts and Their Texts (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1996). Identify- ing the contributions of individuals in any text represents a daunting task under ideal circumstances, but when collaborators are anonymous, indeterminate in number, and of unknown purpose, it requires overwhelming evidence to defend anything more than the most banal assertions. The collation of independent wit- nesses for at least one work in a manuscript is essential, of course, when isolating unique copying features. Still, even then it would assume much to attribute ap- parent tendencies to a single scribe, let alone extrapolate a coherent rationale of intervention, without first repeating this comparison across several other texts in the same hand. 6 6. This logical conclusion complicates Pearsall's call to study the methods of professional compilers since those manuscripts produced by commercial outfits would quite often fail to sat- isfy one or more of these basic requirements for meaningful scribal analysis. Without intention on the part of the copyist, though, it is impossible to speak of any true scribal agenda. It is difficult to imagine how scholars lacking fortuitous textual circumstances could improve much on the standard description of usus scribendi already familiar to those even passingly acquainted with the works of Kane, Eu- gene Vinaver, or their predecessors. 7 7. Despite their very different approaches to the issues of authorial intention and the pri- macy of documentary evidence, both Kane and Vinaver subscribe to the same understanding of scribal habit inherited from much earlier textual critics like Karl Lachmann and Paul Maas. In this adherence to nineteenth-century notions of scribal tampering, neither is exceptional among medieval editors. (See citation to Kane in note 4 above; Eugene Vinaver, "Principles of Textual Emendation," in Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature Presented to Profes- sor Mildred K. Pope [Manchester: Manchester Univ. Press, 1939], 351–369; Karl Lachmann, Caroli Lachmanni in T. Lucretii Cari De Rerum Natura Libros Commentarius Quartum Editus , 3rd ed. [Berolini: Georgii Reimeri, 1866]; Paul Maas, Textual Criticism , trans. Barbara Flower [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958]; etc.) The most prohibitive requirement of study- ing unique scribal agendas is therefore the reliable identification of individual copyists with sizable oeuvres that encompass multiple texts extant in at least one other independent witness. Among the select group meeting this minimal demand in full, Robert Thorn- ton stands out as particularly well-suited for a case study in scribal intention owing to both his status as an amateur copyist and the well-deserved critical at- tention his writings have previously attracted. Thornton, otherwise an unremark- able member of the fifteenth-century English gentry, created two miscellanies intended for his family's private edification: Lincoln Cathedral MS 91 (olim Lin- coln Cathedral A.5.2) and British Library MS Add. 31042. 8 8. George Keiser, John J. Thompson, and Karen Stern have all written extensively about the compilation, likely purpose, and early provenance of the Thornton manuscripts. While they have agreed with one another for the most part in regard to these issues, Stern deviates from the consensus in proposing that the British Library manuscript was a commercial venture. Thompson has responded convincingly to that claim, however, pointing out the circumstantial nature of many of Stern's arguments (George R. Keiser, "Lincoln Cathedral Library MS. 91: Life and Milieu of the Scribe," Studies in Bibliography 32 [1979]: 158–179; George R. Keiser, "More Light on the Life and Milieu of Robert Thornton," Studies in Bibliography 36 (1983): 111–119; John J. Thompson, Robert Thornton and the London Thornton Manuscript: British Library MS Additional 31042 [Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1987]; Karen Stern, "The London Thornton Miscellany: A New Description of British Museum Additional Manuscript 31042," Scriptorium: Revue Internationale des Etudes Relatives aux Manuscrits/International Review of Manuscript Studies 30 [1976]: 26–37; 201–218). These compendiums of devotional literature and courtly poetry, while doubtless shaped in part by the availability of suitable exemplars, also appear indebted to Thornton's own tastes as an independent scribe. 9 9. Thornton clearly exercised some judgment, for instance, in the selection and arrange- ment of his texts as evidenced by the grouping of generically similar works with one another as well as the prevalence (with a handful of minor exceptions like Lyarde ) of what can be character- ized as morally edifying literature. One example of these interests is his large collection of alliterative romances, which raises his work from curiosity to marvel with the inclusion of Wynnere and Wastour and the Morte Arthure among other notewor- thy witnesses. Clearly, as the sole source for documentary evidence regarding these highly regarded poems, Thornton's manuscripts possess enough historical import to justify reanalysis of his scribal habits. Yet while this selection of texts adequately explains his work's literary interest, Thornton's unusual freedom has direct bearing on our ability as textual critics to evaluate his intent as well: sub- ject to external pressures less demanding than those facing professional scribes, Thornton had greater opportunity to develop idiosyncratic copying habits that suggest personal motives more nuanced than either expediency or accuracy. This providential combination of scribal independence with textual merit makes ten- able an investigation into one copyist's compilation methods that could reshape widely-accepted notions about an important source of medieval literature. II. Past Assessments of Robert Thornton Before we move forward with an investigation of Thornton's idiosyncrasies focused on his scribal agenda, however, it is instructive to examine those conclu- sions reached by critics whose primary concern has been with reconstructing authorial texts. These analyses, well-argued and reflecting sincere conviction, highlight in their range and contradiction the impressionistic character of many such considerations of scribal intent. Consider, for example, the amusing contrast between the appraisals of Thornton offered by L. F. Casson and Mary Hamel: To [Thornton and his scribal predecessors] must be given credit for having done a con- siderable amount of tidying up.… But, as always happens when a text is emended by hit-and-miss methods, when attempting to set right a passage they did not understand, they sometimes emended away from the true reading rather than towards it, and the result was a series of new errors. 10 10. L. F. Casson, ed., Sir Degrevant , EETS O.S. 221 (1949; London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1970), xxix. More important, [Thornton] and his predecessors exhibited a remarkable scrupulousness in the transmission of rare and unfamiliar words, though sometimes in disguised form; there is little evidence of scribal rationalization, normalization of alliterative patterns, or other sorts of editorial tampering.… Thornton and his predecessors, in short, all seem to have been of the "mechanical" school of copyists.… 11 11. Mary Hamel, ed., Morte Arthure (New York: Garland, 1984), 4. Hoyt Duggan has ef- fectively countered her interpretation of Thornton's self-corrections by pointing out the impos- sibility of drawing any sound conclusions about the scribe's reliability without an independent witness for verification of archetypal features (Hoyt N. Duggan, "Scribal Self-Correction and Editorial Theory," Neuphilologische Mitteilungen: Bulletin de la Societe Neophilologique 91:2 [1990]: 215–227). It is difficult to imagine any reconciliation between these conclusions, but gener- ous readers might perhaps imagine that inherent differences between the texts under consideration led to these incompatible assessments. Unfortunately, the arguments of Sir Israel Gollancz and Stephanie Trigg regarding Wynnere and Wastour undermine any such glossing interpretation: A minute study has revealed an unexpectedly large number of errors due to corruption, misreading, substitution of words, and other causes.… The substitution of more modern words for difficult, rare, and archaic forms, and the obvious attempts to make some sense of corrupt passages, must be referred to scribal intention, whether on the part of Thornton or a predecessor.… There is perhaps no more corrupt Middle-English manuscript than this of Wynnere and Wastour . 12 12. Sir Israel Gollancz, ed., Wynnere and Wastoure (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1920), i–ii. In editing a single manuscript copy, we are necessarily quite dependent on the scribe. Fortunately, Thornton seems to have had a strong sense of responsibility to his exemplars. He was presumably not working under supervision, but on a number of occasions he can be observed checking his text against his exemplar and correcting his own work. 13 13. Stephanie Trigg, ed., Wynnere and Wastoure , EETS 297 (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1990), xxx. As her introduction makes clear, Trigg bases a great deal of her charac- terization of Thornton the scribe on Mary Hamel's conclusions regarding the copyist's self- correction. As has already been noted, however, there are serious flaws in how Hamel reaches her conclusions. Less generous critics, in light of these disagreements and their chronology, might note here that Casson and Gollancz represent an earlier generation of scholar- ship and contend that it should be expected that their work lacks the critical nuance of more enlightened days. Frances McSparran's recent and persuasive work, though, complicates that condescending narrative by taking a more skepti- cal view of Thornton's reliability: [Thornton's] deviations from the archetype seem the outcome of two different tendencies: on the one hand, casual carelessness and garrulity, on the other a zeal to clarify things by identifying speakers.… We must think of the scribes who copied [Octovian's versions] and similar romances as scribe-editors, revising content and recasting form as they write, partly deliberately and partly automatically. 14 14. Frances McSparran, ed., Octovian, Edited from Lincoln Dean and Chapter Library MS 91 and Cambridge, University Library, MS Ff.2. 38 , EETS 289 (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1986), 16. It must be stressed that I am not implying that every interpretation referred to here is neces- sarily flawed, but rather that the context in which scribal habit is commonly studied encourages scholars to shape their opinions of copyists to suit specific editorial aims. I would suggest in McSparran's case that, given the textual evidence available in relation to Octovian , there was no need for her to adopt uncritical assumptions like those that undermine those other findings cited here. Still, her reasonable decision to only detail evidence taken from the poem she edited means that McSparran's findings are necessarily incomplete. What is one to make of these conflicting interpretations? Rather than differences in textual evidence or critical acumen, it would seem that the obstacles faced by editors in identifying authorial readings have most influenced their findings about scribal intent: those casting doubt on Thornton's faithfulness arrive at their readings through collations of independent witnesses (Casson and McSparran) or appeals to an aesthetic ideal (Gollancz) ultimately posited on the imperfection of all surviving documents; those defending his work (Hamel and Trigg) invariably lack the resources for the former approach and doubt the validity of the latter. Bluntly speaking, explications of Thornton's habits to date have told us much more about how certain editorial methods encourage assumptions about scribes generally than how one fifteenth-century copyist interacted with his exemplars. The elimination of such bias is the most important reason to stop discussing scribal habit only in the context of authorial intent and instead begin treating it as a subject worthy of investigation in its own right. III. The Methodology of Reassessment Allowing that any true reassessment of Thornton must approach his scribal contributions as legitimate objects of study, the present inquiry employs a two- step process that first contrasts his manuscripts against other witnesses to isolate unique readings and then seeks explanations for those variants consistent with what is known of his background. When this strategy is followed, patterns of change emerge that commonly involve the insertion of extraneous dialogue at- tributions, conjunctions, negations, and intensifiers as well as more generalized stylistic smoothing through the rearrangement of word order and explicit iden- tification of a sentence's subjects or objects. On occasion these changes seem indifferent in effect, but more often than not the copyist sacrifices poetic fea- tures like metricality to make basic syntactic structure and narrative content more explicit even when these elements should be perfectly clear to any reader. Evaluating these elements of his scribal profile in light of what we can ascertain about Thornton, the cumulative evidence suggests that he engaged in predictable interventions motivated by a desire to present these tales orally for the moral education of his family. Providing a factual basis about Thornton's characteristic habits on which a broader analysis and interpretation of his scribal agenda can rest presents its own challenges. Foremost among these difficulties is the selection of specific works from which reliable evidence regarding scribal habit may be inferred. Given that the purpose of this study is to differentiate one scribe's emendations from those originating with either the author or other copyists, the most fundamental criteria in choosing texts must be the existence of independent witnesses to contrast with the Thornton redactions. This basic principle rests on the assumption that shared readings between related manuscripts often represent inherited text, whether ar- chetypal or not, whereas unique passages imply an original scribal intervention. 15 15. Hoyt Duggan, in his answer to Mary Hamel's article on scribal self-correction (see note 11), summarizes the basic reason for excluding unique works. As he comments, "[t]he high rate of success in removing error that… Hamel [claims] for Thornton is not, lacking at least one other manuscript for comparison, capable of rational demonstration" (Duggan 224). A high incidence of any textual feature may be intriguing, in other words, but no critical in- terpretation can be attempted in the absence of independent witnesses with which to contrast such characteristics. Among those writings that meet this requirement, it would also seem reasonable to limit the study further to the same poems that have focused scholarly attention on Robert Thornton to ensure some homogeneity within the evidence. 16 16. While extending this investigation to those Latin and religious tracts that constitute a large portion of Thornton's miscellanies might seem desirable, these should be excluded for fear that works in foreign languages or those carrying the aura of sanctity might receive treatment different from vernacular romances. On the other hand, combining alliterative and tail-rhyme romances seems acceptable since the thematic and linguistic continuities across this largely homogeneous group suggest that a copyist's behavior would remain consistent. These prerequisites yield a basic corpus of six Middle English romances: Sir Degrevant (which survives in one other manuscript), Octovian (existing in two manuscript besides Thornton's), The Siege of Jerusalem (for which eight other witnesses are known), The Parlement of the Thre Ages (partially preserved in another manuscript), The Awntyrs off Arthure (recorded in three other manuscripts), and Richard Coer de Lyon (existing in six other witnesses). 17 17. Appendix 1 lists the manuscripts represented in this collation and the scholarly edi- tions employed. With the issue of which works to include resolved, the next step in defining the scope of this investigation involves choosing specific passages in each work for collation. Since an acceptable policy must minimize the chance that unchar- acteristic copying stints or problematic stretches of text will skew the study's conclusions, selecting lengthy passages far removed from one another seems the most conservative approach. With these criteria in mind, one finds that groups of one hundred lines near the beginning and end of the manuscript witnesses for each text will serve admirably in almost every case. An exception to this deci- sion only appears justified when looking at Richard Coer de Lyon , where accidental duplication of twenty lines by Thornton generates unique evidence outside these boundaries equally deserving of inclusion in the study. 18 18. Appendix 1 lists the lines chosen for collation. The total body of text under investigation according to these standards will therefore be more than four thousand lines in six texts witnessed across twenty-seven manuscripts, an extensive collection of data that should provide enough material to accurately characterize Thornton's scribal habits. Having established this study's textual boundaries, we can now address the crucial matter of adopting guidelines to differentiate Thornton's scribal interven- tions from variants introduced by other copyists. Considering the wide-spread confusion evident in previous scholarship on this topic, it is only sensible that these principles set a standard for acceptable evidence that is both concise in its definition and equally clear about its limitations. 19 19. Frances McSparran in her edition of Octovian for the EETS is one of the few scholars to acknowledge both aspects of Thornton's scribal persona, and her introduction provides invalu- able information about the copyist's work on that romance (see Octovian 16–21). Consequently, no variant in Thornton's manuscripts will be definitively ascribed to his intervention in this study unless analogous readings appear several times across multiple texts in his copies while similar passages not found in his texts occur rarely in other wit- nesses. This simple procedure will allow for the swift identification of features deserving closer evaluation and eliminate from consideration those of ambiguous provenance: for example, if comparisons between the manuscript witnesses re- veal that both Thornton and other scribes regularly omit pronouns, this tendency could not be credited with certainty to any one copyist even if each instance were singular; evidence that Thornton alone inserts disproportionately large numbers of extraneous conjunctions in his romances, on the other hand, would signal that this idiosyncrasy represents an aspect of his individual copying habits. Such enumerative analysis is admittedly incapable of establishing the scribal nature of particular readings, no doubt explaining its dismissal in the past by editors con- cerned with authority, but it will allow for the description of those broad patterns in variation relevant to the issue of scribal intent. While this strict methodology might disqualify some lightly attested features contributed by Thornton to his works, guidelines less restrictive would certainly lead to uncertain if not errone- ous attributions that would undermine the conclusions extrapolated from this investigation. IV. Constructing Thornton's Scribal Profile Applying these criteria for determining scribal intervention to the corpus selected earlier, one finds that the most striking examples of idiosyncratic copy- ing involve dialogue attributions. The collations suggest that Thornton, rather than allowing readers to determine the presence of direct speech and a speaker's identity using contextual clues, commonly inserted phrases like "he said" or "she spoke" to remove all potential for syntactic ambiguity. 20 20. Frances McSparran notes this tendency in her work on Octovian and it should be ac- knowledged that her reference to this feature inspired the further analysis provided here (see Octovian 15). Fifteen instances of this type of intervention occur in Thornton's manuscripts, thirteen of which are unique, compared to only nine instances found elsewhere that he does not share. 21 21. These examples are listed in the second appendix (section I). These numbers might not seem particularly remarkable, but it is im- portant to remember that in context such a distribution means that close to two thirds of such dialogue attributions occur only in one copyist's manuscripts whereas the remaining third is divided across the other twenty-seven indepen- dent witnesses. 22 22. It seems appropriate to note here that the majority of counter-examples for this feature come from a single witness to the Awntyrs , Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, Coligny, Geneva, f.5a (the Ireland MS). This odd distribution, differing from that for the other features discussed here, indicates that Thornton's idiosyncratic habits overlapped in part with other scribes. Again, it is important to see the numbers presented here in the context of the entire corpus under consideration. Octovian , as copied in Lincoln Cathedral MS 91, demonstrates Thornton's characteristic treatment of dialogue attributions in its very first in- stance of direct speech: Scho felle hir lorde one knees agayne And of his sorow scho gan hym frayne And of his mekyll care Sir scho sais if it were ᶾour will ᶾoure concelle for to schewe me till And of ᶾour lyffes fare 23 23. Octovian 11. 52–57; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. This stands in contrast to the same passage in Cambridge Ff.2.38, which at the same point has a syntactically unmarked transition from narration to dialogue: Sche felle on kneys hym agayne And of hys sorowe sche can hym frayne And of hys mekyll care For yf that hyt were yowre wylle Yowre counsell for to schewe me tyll Of yowre lyuys fare 24 24. Octovian 11. 52–57; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.2.38. There is no way to determine the relative authority of these readings in the ab- sence of clear metrical evidence, but the first iteration's attempt to smooth away ambiguity through explicitness suggests the scribal nature of the Lincoln redac- tion. This failure in poetic economy, while not conclusive, leads to the stylistic flatness often ascribed by textual scholars to copyists and thereby supports the assertion that such expanded readings are non-authorial. 25 25. Piers Plowman 136. While typifying the changes to dialogue, though, that example cited above from Octovian only becomes significant in light of supporting evidence found in other romances proving it reflects Thornton's usus scribendi . These examples are cited by line number in this article's second appendix, but special note should be taken of those instances within the portion of Richard Coer de Lyon copied twice by our scribe. One can find in that short passage startlingly clear corroboration of the scribal nature of these attributions spread across three lines grouped closely together: Bot a knyghte þan spak vnto þe kyng And seid hym Sir grefe the na thyng.… þat askyd hym wiþowtten lesynge And seid kane þou me telle in any manere How one kyng Richerd þat i vengyd were And he ansuerde wiþ hert full fre And seid þerappone i muste avyse me 26 26. Richard ll. 985–986, 995–998; British Library MS Add. 31042 (fol. 131). Each of the dialogue attributions above is left out of all other witnesses to Rich- ard and, in two instances, this also includes the accidental second copying of the passage later in the same manuscript by Thornton himself. This contrast within his own work appears very suggestive in regards to the handling of dialogue and firmly establishes that the scribe modified his exemplars freely: Bot þan a knyghte spake vnto þe kynge Sir he seid grefe the no thing.… That askede hym sone wiþowte lesynge Kane þou me telle one any manere Of this Kyng Richerde þat I vengede were And he ansuerde wiþ herte full fre There appon me moste avyssede be 27 27. Richard ll. 985–986, 995–998; British Library MS Add. 31042 (fol. 143). Given that six independent witnesses along with this second copy by Thornton indicate no explicit dialogue attributions, it is extremely probable that these read- ings originate with our scribe and not some earlier archetype. This pattern of intervention implies that Thornton consciously marked the move from narration to dialogue, but, despite the conspicuous nature of these changes, they are not the most pervasive modifications he makes to syntactic transitions. Another element of Thornton's scribal practice involving the connections between syntactic elements manifests itself in an abundance of unnecessary con- junctions and conjunctive adverbs. Scanning the collation sample for evidence of these paratactic features uncovers two hundred and twenty-one instances, of which one hundred and fifty-eight are unique, showing clearly the copyist's re- markable dependence on this grammatical crutch. 28 28. The examples are listed in the second appendix (section II). Other manuscript witnesses, in contrast to such profusion, exhibit only ninety-seven examples not found in either the Lincoln Cathedral or British Library manuscripts. Typifying the con- structions favored by Thornton, the following passage appears in his copy of The Awntyrs off Arthure: And thus those hathelles with-holdes þat hende And whane he was saued and sonde þei made hyme sworne to Sir Gawayne in þat stonde And sythene a kniᶾte of þe table ronde Vn-tille his lyues ende 29 29. Awntyrs ll. 698–702; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. While Thornton's reading departs radically from the other manuscripts in the third line of this selection, that change is not carried over into the surrounding lines in which the relevant conjunctions appear. Although the other three witnesses all differ slightly from one another, the follow- ing reading found in MS Douce 324 of the Bodleian Library illustrates the aver- sion to repetitive connective words common to these other versions of the text: Þus þat haþel in hiᶾ with-holdes þat hende Whane he was saued sone Þei made Sir Galerone þat stonde A kniᶾte of þe table ronde To his lyues ende 30 30. Awntyrs ll. 698–702; Bodleian Library MS Douce 324. Despite the brevity of this passage, the thoroughness with which Thornton fills out his text's transitional elements seems difficult to mistake. If one ignores the medial conjunction in the second line because of its presence in another witness, there remain four unique conjunctions and adverbs within these lines of the Lincoln redaction not found elsewhere. Two of these, furthermore, introduce independent clauses that grammatically require no explicit linkage to the preced- ing text. This lack of function, along with the combined authority of the other manuscripts, implies the scribal nature of these elements and suggests their origin lies with Thornton. As with dialogue attributions, though, the firm association of paratactic in- sertions with one scribe relies upon the distribution of the feature across several independent texts. This seems especially true in regard to these transitional ele- ments because Thornton's approach differs from his scribal peers not so much in nature as in degree. Along with the numerous other examples listed in the second appendix, The Parlement of the Thre Ages provides support for this observation while also demonstrating that Thornton's extraneous conjunctions and adverbs are notably more widespread even when compared against what has been identi- fied as a more corrupt witness: 31 31. According to M. Y. Offord, the Ware manuscript "preserves fewer of the old construc- tions, some of the rarer or older words have been replaced by more familiar ones, and names are often corrupt beyond recognition" ( Parlement xvi-xvii). This estimation has been accepted by subsequent critics. And the Sowdane at Saragose full sothely he fyndis And there he bett down þe burghe and Sir Merchill he tuke And that daye he dide to the dethe als he had wele seruede Bot by than his wyes were wery and woundede full many 32 32. Parlement ll. 568–571; British Library MS Add. 31042. Thornton begins each of these four lines with an extraneous conjunction, whereas the Ware scribe, typically more prone to copying errors and sophistications than Thornton, records only one of those verses in a similar manner: The Sawdon of Saragos sothely he fyndes And þere he betes down þe burgh &amp; balam he takes That day he dud hym to deed as he had wel seruyd Þan he weys wery &amp; woundid full many 33 33. Parlement ll. 568–571; British Library MS Add. 33994. Although at this point the specific rationale for such interventions remains un- clear, the impression that these changes amount to something more thorough- going than the usual scribal tendency to round out lines is strengthened greatly by comparison to the Ware text. Thornton's indulgent use of these simple function words ultimately complements the dialogue attributions and confirms that an interest in syntactic transitions is a central component of his scribal profile. Differing slightly in emphasis from previous examples of his unique contribu- tions, Thornton's preference for doubling negative modifiers introduces a new wrinkle into his tendency to use certain common grammatical constructions with unusual frequency. This particular rhetorical ploy, which emphasizes negation without changing or adding nuance to meaning, appears uniquely eleven times in Thornton's texts and only six times when he does not record it. 34 34. The examples are listed in the second appendix (section III). A fairly typical example of this change's effect on the text can be seen in Sir Degrevant 's descrip- tion of the festivities surrounding the titular knight's marriage: Þare come in a daunce Alle þe Dugepers of France Me thynke swylke a purueance Was gay to be-halde ᶾitt knew I neuer nan so wysse To telle þe metis of pryce Ne couthe of þat seruyce Was serued in þat sale. 35 35. Sir Degrevant ll. 1869–1876; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. This passage shows how the copyist's use of doubling emphasizes what could be thought of as a semantic transition from positive to negative, indicating some continuity with but also extension of the scribal features previously noted. The Cambridge Manuscript version of Sir Degrevant , in contrast, does not demonstrate any such concern for highlighting negative statements: Þer come in a daunse IX Doseperus of Fraunce Me thowᶾth syche a countynaunce Was joye to be-holde I knewe neuere man so wys Þat couþ tell þe seruise Ne scrye þe metys of prys Was serued in þat sale. 36 36. Sir Degrevant ll. 1869–1876; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.i.6. The difference between the two readings here may have been inspired by minim confusion, but, even assuming mechanical error, the change suggests a predis- position toward doubled negative constructions. Indeed, this preference pres- ents itself even more forcibly in passages where there is no easy paleographic explanation: In tornament nor in no fyghte In þe werlde þer ne was a bettir knyghte No worthier vndir wede. 37 37. Octovian ll. 19–21; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. Although the additions in these lines do not undermine the meter, this reading compares unfavorably in its redundancy with the less convoluted statement of the other witness: In turnament and yn fyght Yn the worlde was not a bettur knyght Then he was vndur wede. 38 38. Octovian ll. 19–21; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.2.38. Straining to accommodate the doubled negatives, the Thornton passage lacks the jauntiness of expression evident in the other manuscript's reading and shows the copyist's willingness to sacrifice style in order to accentuate sense. Thornton's emphasizing of such semantic markers, while not overwhelmingly attested given the limited environments that lend themselves to such constructions, clearly jus- tifies their inclusion on a list of his scribal habits alongside more pronounced intrusions. The unique stress Thornton places on some semantic markers becomes easier to discern when one considers his handling of adverbial intensifiers. These much- maligned "filler" words appear seventy-five times in Thornton's work, sixty-one of which are unique, as opposed to the twenty-seven times he does not share in all the other manuscripts combined. 39 39. The examples are listed in the second appendix (section IV). Although such intensifiers sometimes prove original in Middle English verse, the disparity between the number found in Thornton's copies and other redactions suggests that once again the multiplica- tion of examples is the responsibility of this particular copyist. Octovian illustrates this increased density quite dramatically in an early passage involving several unique instances of scribal filler: For full soothe sawis I will ᶾow singe Off whaym ᶾe worde full wyde gan sprynge And þe will a stownde me lythe In þe bukes of Rome als it es tolde How befelle amange oure eldyrs olde Full ofte and fele sythe 40 40. Octovian ll. 7–12; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. Hoyt Duggan in private correspondence raises the possibility that the impetus for Thornton's change involves differences in syllabifica- tion between the original dialect and the copyist's Northern forms. Specifically, the need to insert a word may have been prompted by the loss of a syllable in both "worde" and "rime," although the type of change adopted still would seem to be influenced by the scribal habits described here. Altogether there are four words in this passage that qualify as intensifiers, three instances of "full" along with one of "fele," and three of these have no parallel in the reading of the other manuscript witness: Sothe sawys y wyll yow mynge Of whom þe worde wyde gan sprynge Yf ye wyll lystyn and lythe Yn bokys of ryme hyt ys tolde How hyt befelle owre eldurs olde Well oftynsythe. 41 41. Octovian ll. 7–12; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.2.38. It should be immediately apparent that, since their very nature ensures that such words are extraneous to sense, the simple violation of poetic economy cannot be held as proof of their scribal nature. Additionally, readings such as these sel- dom lead to metrically unacceptable lines since the differences they create rarely exceed a single unstressed syllable. Instead, the best evidence identifying them as a copyist's intrusion is provided by the large number of unique examples in well-attested texts like The Siege of Jerusalem: Tytus tarieþ noᶾt for þat bot to þe temple wendiþ Þat all rayled þe roof with rubyes full grete…. Out þe tresour to take Tytus commaundyþ… Bassynes of full bryghte gold and mekill bryᶾt gere. 42 42. Siege of Jerusalem ll. 1253–1254, 1263, 1268; British Library MS Add. 31042. It is in- teresting to note that Thornton seems to be correcting a metrical deficiency in his exemplar to which even the most reliable copies seem indifferent. It is quite possible that the original poet intended a trisyllabic pronunciation for "rubyes" and, in any event, this suspected motivation does not necessitate the specific correction Thornton adopts. That decision instead seems di- rected by his more general concern for augmenting semantic emphasis. Tytus tarieþ noᶾt for þat bot to þe temple wendiþ Þat all ryaled þe roof with rubyes grete…. Out þe tresour to take Tytus commaundyþ… Bassynes of brend gold and mekill bryᶾt gere. 43 43. Siege of Jerusalem ll. 1249–1250, 1259, 1264; British Library Cotton Vespian E.xvi. Given that six other witnesses exist for these lines, including a group represented by the second passage cited above that has been identified as closely related to the Thornton copy quoted first, the unique nature of the examples in his redac- tion strongly suggests the scribal nature of such additions. With similar situa- tions existing in Awntyrs and Richard , the insertion of intensifiers can therefore be accepted as one last example of the copyist's attempt to highlight important semantic markers through his additions. However, the addition of new material is not the only means by which Thornton clarifies syntactic meaning and this is demonstrated most clearly by his regular tinkering with both word order and the degree of explicitness in his identification of sentence elements. These instances of syntactic smoothing oc- cur ninety-five times in Thornton's work, sixty-nine of which are unique, and only thirty-eight times in other manuscripts where they are not repeated in his work. 44 44. These examples are listed in the second appendix (section V). Sir Degrevant provides a cluster of changes typifying these tendencies early in its text, as shown here in excerpts from Thornton's copy and the Cambridge University Library manuscript respectively: And to the castelle þay wende. With-owttyn mare rehersyng, Twyse þay made þaire saghtelyng; He grauntis hym Mildor þe ᶾynge To hys lyues ende. 45 45. Degrevant ll. 1820–1824; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. And to chaumbur þei wende. With-outyn mor rehersyng Made was þe sauᶾthlyng, And grauntyd hym Myldor þe ᶾing Till hys lyues ende. 46 46. Degrevant ll. 1820–1824; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.i.6. In this passage, Thornton adds pronouns to explicitly identify what are treated as implied subjects in the other manuscript, thereby incidentally altering the syntax to create two independent sentences as reflected in the modern punctuation cited here. Again, the lines as written in the other witness are not difficult to interpret and this action appears to be hyper-correction, just like the following sentence inversion in the Thornton and Cambridge copies of Octovian : Sythen þou wolde wedde me to wyffe, I wolde lyue in Cristen lyfe, My joye solde euir be newe. 47 47. Octovian ll. 1374–1376; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. And syth ye wolde me wedde to wyfe, I wolde leue yn Crysten lyfe, My yoye were euyr newe. 48 48. Octovian ll. 1402–1404; Cambridge University Library MS Ff.2.38. This example shows Thornton moving the object of "wedde" from an anterior to posterior position, creating the standard subject-verb-object sentence order most common in English prose but less rigidly adhered to in poetry. Wholesale recast- ing of sentence order is a bit rarer than the explicit identification of subjects and objects, but such interventions do convey admirably the overall essence of the changes Thornton introduces into his texts. Correcting what is not essentially in error, such inversion shows our scribe once again replacing poetic features with more prosaic expressions whenever the latter are achieved through grammatical constructions that rely on an audience's close attention to detail. V. From Profile to Rationale Although the firm identification of five distinct types of scribal intervention constitutes in itself a worthwhile discovery, especially for editors attempting to ascertain Thornton's role in his unique texts, the results also encourage con- sideration of what motivation might lie behind these changes. Two possibilities immediately suggest themselves, random chance and scribal laxity, but these simple explanations prove inadequate. Attributing the copyist's unique readings to chance, for instance, overlooks both the pervasiveness of the changes made and the striking regularity in both their method and function. It clearly violates the principle of Occam's razor to suppose each of these individually minor altera- tions could occur by accident in such predictable and patterned ways. However, while chance may be quickly ruled out as unlikely, the tendency among scribes to "simplif[y] their task by reproducing content and sense rather than exact de- tails of wording and language" that Frances McSparran credits for Thornton's variations in Octovian requires more deliberation. 49 49. Octovian 20. McSparran's belief that such changes reflect the translation encouraged by relaxed copying procedures, espe- cially if one defines this process in terms of idiolects rather than dialects, offers a tempting rationale for the choices Thornton makes. Still, this approach fails to account for the somewhat obsessive spelling changes identified by Mary Hamel in her study of this copyist's self-corrections. 50 50. Morte Arthure 126–127. It should perhaps be stressed here that the shortcomings of Hamel's study mentioned earlier are confined to her assumption of scribal fidelity based on the self-corrections she identifies and not the basic observation that Thornton expended great effort to correct his texts. It defies reason to propose that the same scribe who commonly altered his spellings in an attempt to mimic his exemplar would add several hundred words to each text without considering their purpose. One must therefore conclude that the emphases placed on syn- tactic structure and semantic markers by the scribe's intervention originate in a conscious attempt by Thornton to shape his work. As previously indicated, determining the specific agenda behind those pur- poseful changes Thornton made to his exemplars requires an examination of his scribal habits in light of what can be established about his background. This involves, in effect, an appeal to the "cultural milieu" in which the Lincoln and British Library texts were compiled. 51 51. Keiser (1979). George Keiser first introduced and fleshed out the concept of Thorn- ton's cultural milieu in this useful article. Also see George R. Keiser, "More Light on the Life and Milieu of Robert Thornton" Studies in Bibliography 36 (1983): 111–119. Thornton's particular social environment, as reflected in the choice and arrangement of his manuscripts, appears to value especially the didactic potential of the written word. As George Keiser points out, "Robert Thornton [along with another of his contemporaries, Elizabeth Sywardby] … clearly found in the book an important, perhaps even an essential means to spiritual fulfillment and … their interest in the book for this purpose does not make them by any means unusual members of their society." 52 52. Keiser (1979), 172. By divid- ing his miscellanies evenly between religious tracts and moralistic secular content, Thornton signals to his audience that these texts should function as exemplars for good-living. Even the vernacular romances largely conform to this principle, on occasion stating explicitly in their incipits that the portrayals of "owre eldurs olde" were meant to teach "soothe sawys." 53 53. Octovian ll. 7; 11. Also supporting this interpretation is Thornton's inclusion of the Vita Sancti Christofori in the midst of the romance section of Lincoln Cathedral MS 98, although this text may have been so placed because of its fantastical character rather than its moral import. Although perhaps not self-evident, a connection between Thornton's interest in presenting chivalric tales as if they were secular saints' lives and his copying habits can be made. Considered as a system of scribal intervention, the changes revealed in the preceding consider- ation of the Thornton manuscripts seem complementary to each other in their efforts to simplify, smooth, and emphasize different grammatical elements essen- tial to sense. All of these interventions, then, reveal the common scribal desire to alert readers to potentially confusing narrative elements and ensure that no one misinterpret the author's perceived intent. 54 54. Further background information on scribes with similar tendencies can be found in the introduction to the Athlone edition of the Piers Plowman A-text (see Piers Plowman 128ff). This inclination can be reconciled with a counter-tendency to preserve minutiae like the exemplar's spellings if one allows that, given Thornton's concern that each tale's didactic message reach his audience, an intermittent willingness to sacrifice literal fidelity to preserve his texts' underlying meaning might represent another form of conservatism. In a sense, the pattern of intervention revealed here suggests that Thornton elected to follow a rational tertium quid between the extremes of mechanical and creative copying ascribed to him by previous scholars to ensure the moralistic themes he saw as important would be accessible to his audience. While concern for his readers' understanding provides a unifying motivation for the copyist's interventions, it falls short of explaining why Thornton em- phasized one specific set of syntactic transitions and semantic markers so much more than his contemporaries. The final explanation of Thornton's grammati- cal tinkering instead depends upon the overlap between the ways in which the scribe emended his exemplars and the textual features some critics have used to argue that his romances were copied down from performances by minstrels. The proliferation of linking words, poetic filler, and other redundancies created by his changes were all considered symptomatic of oral composition and the demands it placed on the poet's creative resources. Representing a standard interpretation of Thornton's romances grounded in oral composition theory, Casson claims that "X [ Sir Degrevant 's archetypal form] was committed to memory by a minstrel. He probably transmitted the poem to another of his kind, and the process may have continued for several generations (in the textual sense). This is the most satisfactory way of accounting for most of the numerous periphrases, anticipa- tions, recollections, upset rhyme schemes, inconsistencies, insertions of redun- dant words and general literary dilution to be found on almost every page of [Thornton's Lincoln manuscript]." 55 55. Degrevant xxix. However, disenchantment with theories of oral composition and dissemination has led to a rejection of such generalizations as demonstrated in McSparran's recent introduction to Octovian: "The rather free variation of wording.… seems inconsistent with this preservation of phonologi- cally non-significant details of spelling from the archetype. The first would be compatible with oral transmission, the second could not survive it, and must de- pend on a written tradition." 56 56. Octovian 20. McSparran's explanation of variation between the two copies of Octovian , supported by Hamel's work on self-correction, seems ef- fectively to refute Casson's argument proposing oral composition. However, her subsequent admonition to "consider the [presumably written] cultural context in which popular romances were produced and circulated" must be combined with recognition that those oral elements identified by Casson aptly summarize the grammatical features privileged by Robert Thornton's scribal habits. While the widespread oral composition of late medieval literature has seemed increasingly unlikely to critics in recent years, study of Thornton's cultural con- text suggests that the oral recitation of romances may represent the key to our copyist's patterns of intervention. The most plentiful evidence of such oral reci- tation comes from the works themselves, wherein poets repeatedly exhort their audience to listen attentively, although Thorlac Turville-Petre is certainly right to warn that such evidence "may be suspected of being an idealization." 57 57. Thorlac Turville-Petre, The Alliterative Revival (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1977), 38. Despite such cautious doubt, though, even Turville-Petre concedes that "[i]t is probable enough that recitation, whether by a professional.… or member of the family, was one method of dissemination [for romances]" and provides intriguing evi- dence of such oral delivery in his edition of the fragmentary "Lament for Sir John of Berkeley." 58 58. Turville-Petre 38. This rhymed alliterative poem gives a short account of another unremarkable fifteenth-century member of the English gentry whose rank and interests seem suggestively similar to those of Thornton: Sir Jon of Barklay cleped þat knyght He reweld him o reson, he rested on right He was a housholder, a hunter ful hiende Þar was no wegh in world to Wymondam to wende He might haf metes mannerly and mirthes amonge And of his semli seruandes semland and songe Daliance of damisels to driue away þo day To rede him oright romance were redi on aray 59 59. Thorlac Turville-Petre, "The Lament for Sir John Berkeley," Speculum 57 (1982): 332–339 (pp. 336–337). The audience is told that John of Berkeley was "a generous householder who entertained in the grandest fashion … with food and jollity, song and … the reading of romances." 60 60. Thorlac Turville-Petre, "Some Medieval English Manuscripts in the North-East Mid- lands," Manuscripts and Readers in Fifteenth-Century England: The Literary Implications of Manuscript Study, Essays from the 1981 Conference at the University of York , ed. Derek Pearsall (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1983), 125–141 (p. 128). If one remains open to the possibility that Thornton, like Sir John, intended either to read his texts aloud for friends and family or have them read by another, his copying style begins to make better sense. This slightly unorthodox explanation of Thornton's alterations would mean that emphasis on syntactic structure and semantic meaning stems from the scribe's belief that his audience would misunderstand more subtle grammatical constructions better suited to the eye than the ear when listening to the tales presented aloud. 61 61. Hoyt Duggan, in his 1976 article on formulas in Middle English alliterative romances, describes a very similar tendency in some manuscripts of the Wars of Alexander . However, he concentrates particularly on how scribal knowledge of oral formulas might influence copying habits (Hoyt N. Duggan, "The Role of Formulas in the Dissemination of a Middle English Al- literative Romance," Studies in Bibliography 29 [1976]: 265–288). The conclusion, albeit tentative, that Thornton consciously crafted the ver- nacular romances in his miscellanies for spoken delivery suggests an approach to the relationship between scribe and exemplar that would significantly change our view of this copyist's work. While previous characterizations of Thornton as alternately conservative or innovative seem to capture in part the complex interaction he engaged in with his texts, these arguments have never been able to account for what seem to be his contradictory tendencies. These failures most likely reflect the assumption that the value of a scribe's work can only be mea- sured against the yardstick of authorial intention and that the need to recover an original meaning precludes in-depth study of individual copyists. Concentrat- ing on scribal intention, though, encourages one to see consistent patterns of intervention like those Thornton engages in as rational attempts to reconcile a received text with an anticipated use. These patterns and the statistical evidence illustrating them can be used then to establish with greater accuracy archetypal readings. In fact, combined with other types of textual evidence, knowledge of Thornton's scribal agenda could have a profound effect on the editing of those texts he copied by allowing for the recovery of authorial readings even in unique witnesses where collation is not possible. VI. Conclusions and Application While the restoration of authorial readings has not been the primary focus of this article, a brief look at two passages in Thornton's unique copies of Wyn- nere and Wastour and the Morte Arthure will begin to suggest practical applications for the scribal profile outlined above. Since information about copying habits can only be used to anticipate tendencies and not identify specific errors, lines have been selected that also exhibit obvious deficiencies when judged according to metrical and alliterative norms. The first of these exemplary passages, taken from the Morte Arthure , describes the arrival of Emperor Lucius' envoys at King Arthur's court and demonstrates how the scribal inversion of sentence structure could upset a poem's delicate structure: So come in sodanly A Senatour of Rome Wytħ sexten knyghtes in A soyte sewande hym one He saluᶾed the souerayne &amp; the sale Aftyr Ilke A kyng Aftyre kyng and mad his enclines 62 62. Morte Arthure ll. 80–83; Lincoln Cathedral MS 91. The first three lines maintain the widely attested A-A-A-X pattern, in which the first three of four stressed words carry the expected alliteration. This is the standard format of the Middle English alliterative long-line and therefore, at least in terms of poetic structure, all three can be taken without further comment as authorial. Unfortunately, in the fourth line the pattern switches to the non- standard A-A-X-A, which is generally not considered an acceptable variation since without alliteration the third stressed syllable cannot fulfill its traditional role as the link between the two half-lines. 63 63. See Hoyt N. Duggan, "Alliterative Patterning as a Basis for Emendation in Middle English Alliterative Poetry," Studies in the Age of Chaucer 8 (1986): 73–105; J. P. Oakden, Allitera- tive Poetry in Middle English: The Dialectal and Metrical Survey (1930; repr. Hamden: Archon Books, 1968). It should be noted that, while he comments on the rarity of patterns lacking alliteration on the third stress, Oakden does not rule out the possibility that they are archetypal. Rather, the closest he comes to any censure is to comment on "how many poets are apt to repudiate the types ax/xa and xa/xa, which never achieved the same prestige as ax/ax, xa/ax—the tradi- tional types" (Oakden 169). Duggan, however, argues convincingly that the statistical evidence and distribution of such atypical readings is a sign of their scribal nature. In light of Thornton's penchant for syntactic smoothing, however, it is probable that the authorial version of this line had a less prosaic ordering of verb and object: "Ilke A kyng Aftyre kyng and his enclines mad." 64 64. While a cautious editor might be tempted to salvage the manuscript reading by adopt- ing an unusual stress assigment, scribal smoothing of inverted authorial phrasing in the b-verse is very common throughout the Morte Arthure . In the first one thousand lines, for instance, there are at least twenty-three other examples of this type of corruption (see ll. 115, 131, 138, 170, 244, 254, 370, 392, 443, 457, 627, 631, 634, 658, 766, 794, 875, 897, 910, 946, 949, 971, and 992). A slightly different situation arises, on the other hand, dur- ing Wynner's speech about responsible forestry in Wynnere and Wastour where it is Thornton's weakness for paratactic expression that suggests a correction to a flawed b-verse metrical pattern: Þe spyres and þe ᶾonge sprynge ᶾe spare to ᶾour children And sayne God wil graunt it his grace to grow at þe last For to [schadewe] ᶾour sones bot þe schame es ᶾour ownn. 65 65. Wynnere and Wastour ll. 398–400; British Library MS Add. 31042 (quoted from the Trigg edition; see note 13). Hoyt Duggan's widely-accepted rules of b-verse metricality stipulate that any b-verse with two or more dips of multiple unstressed syllables are categorically non-authorial, and that restriction would clearly apply to the third line quoted here. 66 66. See Hoyt N. Duggan, "The Shape of the B-Verse in Middle English Alliterative Po- etry," Speculum 61 (1986): 564–592; Hoyt N. Duggan, "Final -e and the Rhythmic Structure of the B-Verse in Middle English Alliterative Poetry," Modern Philology 86:2 (1988): 119–145; Hoyt N. Duggan, "Stress Assignment in Middle English Alliterative Poetry," Journal of English and Germanic Philology 89:3 (1990): 309–329. Duggan's findings have been widely accepted, although there are skeptics like Trigg (see Wynnere and Wastour xxxvi). While the only logical correction for this error is the elimination of the extraneous conjunction, Thornton's consistent interference with syntactic transi- tions offers yet another means to justify this emendation. Given how glaringly obvious the errors are in both this and the previous example, however, some might question whether the ability to confirm their existence through knowl- edge of Thornton's copying habits is any great advantage. Judging the scribal evidence solely on its ability to unearth new error misrepresents the challenges inherent to the editorial process, though, which is more often stymied by the lack of corroborative evidence for corrections than any shortage of errors needing emendation. An understanding of Thornton's unique tendencies provides the confirmation an editor would need to justify adopting specific changes in both these and many other lines, representing an improvement over past invocations of a generic usus scribendi too easily accommodated to preconceived notions about scribal fidelity. While we are fortunate in the identification of Thornton and his manuscripts, especially given his importance in preserving alliterative verse, the same prin- ciples demonstrated here should inform other new studies of scribal habit as well. That is to say, textual scholars should seek whenever possible to explain scribal agendas in the same detail previously reserved only for the authorial intent. This does not mean abandoning interest in traditional forms of authority, but rather realizing that without such complementary efforts we will never understand fully either aspect of medieval literature. Most editorial appeals to scribal habit carry little weight, unfortunately, representing impressionistic judgments indebted to preconceived notions about scribal fidelity and the best means of recovering authorial readings. The previous scholarship on Robert Thornton demonstrates this susceptibility toward bias, and the case study offered here is intended both as a correction of that specific problem and as a general template for new research. Especially now, as the wider availability and functionality of electronic editions makes such descriptive work less burdensome, textual scholars and editors have little excuse for treating the study of scribal agendas as a mere afterthought. Increased understanding of a copyist's motives may not be possible in every cir- cumstance, but the statistical method offered here at least provides one practical method of answering recent calls to extrapolate from scribal interventions some idea of how early audiences received and interacted with medieval texts. APPENDIX 1 Manuscripts and Lines Collated and Critical Editions Consulted As indicated in the article's main body, the default choices for each text were one-hundred-line groups shared by Thornton's copy with other witnesses at the beginning and end of each text. Those instances where the number of lines ex- ceeds two hundred, excepting the case of Richard Coer de Lyon , reflect the need to compensate for lines omitted in the Thornton texts. I.

Although a preliminary collation was attempted using Ralph Hanna's edition of the Awntyrs , Robert Gates' recording of variant readings has been preferred here as it appears to be much fuller (see Ralph Hanna III, The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyn [Manchester: Manchester Univ. Press, 1974]). While this may simply be a result of the differing apparatus conventions each editor employs, it seemed prudent to work from Gates' edition. II. Octovian , ll. 1–100; 1365–1464. 68 68.

W. Reid Textual critics of Shakespeare have traditionally focused on the names or titles represented in the speech-prefixes of his plays in the course of clas- sifying them as either typeset from foul-papers or as derived from fair copy or prompt-books. This has been so since R. B. McKerrow's truly seminal article in the 1930s, which proposed that the substantive content and consistency of the 'character-names' in an early printed edition could indicate the kind of manu- script that served as its copy. He contrasted the First Folio's 'permanent labels' and 'uniform' names in Two Gentlemen of Verona with the irregularity in The Comedy of Errors of the names for 'the brothers Antipholus and the two Dromios', and then went on to discuss the now well-known alternation in the second quarto of Romeo and Juliet between the names and functions of Juliet's parents, as well as similar inconsistency in the first editions of Love's Labour's Lost, All's Well that Ends Well, The Merchant of Venice , and Titus Andronicus . 1 1. R. B. McKerrow, 'A Suggestion Regarding Shakespeare's Manuscripts', Review of English Studies II (1935), 459–465. In The Comedy of Errors, 'Ant.', 'E. Ant.', 'S. Anti.' for the first brother, 'E. Anti.', 'E. An.', 'Eph. Ant.', 'Anti.', 'Ant.' for the second; 'Dro.', 'S. Dro.' for the former's servant, 'E. Dro. ' for the latter's. In Q2 Romeo and Juliet, 'Cap.', '1 Cap.', 'Father'; 'Wife', 'Old La.', 'Capu. Wi.', 'Ca. Wi.', 'La.', and later ' Mo. ' or ' M. ' after the stage-direction 'Enter Mother'. McKerrow of course presents these examples in their contexts, showing the confusion that results; his provisional classification of seven uniform manuscripts as against seven variable ones still remains largely intact. McKerrow's 'Suggestion' has constituted one of the principal reference points for several generations of editions, including the most recent ones, though as of the end of the last cen- tury his typically coherent, temperate, and modest observations have incurred searching criticism, whether because of their lack of documentary confirmation, the pressure they have had to endure from editorial speculation, or fin de siècle doubt. 2 2. See esp. Paul Werstine, 'McKerrow's "Suggestion" and W. W. Greg', Shakespeare's Speech-Headings: Speaking the Speech in Shakespeare's Plays , ed. George Walton Williams (Newark: Univ. of Delaware Press, 1997), pp. 11–16, and 'McKerrow's "Suggestion" and Twentieth- Century Shakespeare Textual Criticism', Renaissance Drama 19 (1988), 149–173; William B. Long, 'Perspective on Provenance: The Context of Varying Speech-Heads', Shakespeare's Speech- Headings , pp. 21–44, and 'Stage-Directions: A Misinterpreted Factor in Determining Textual Provenance', TEXT 2 (1985), 121–137. Although these studies are compelling in themselves, they do not offer an equally persuasive explanation of the facts that McKerrow observed and assembled. Had he, rather than his bolder friend and colleague W. W. Greg, survived to pur- sue and apply his observations, there might have been less categorical assertion and denial in these matters during the ensuing years. But see also Richard F. Kennedy, 'Speech Prefixes in Some Shakespearean Quartos', Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America ( PBSA ) 92 (1998), 177–209, whose analysis of compositors and type shortage has raised a still different kind of question about such variation in some quartos. Nonetheless, the speech-prefixes of the principal compositor of the First Folio have received less attention from bibliographers than might have been expected. For in some plays, it is the precise forms of Compositor B's speech-prefixes, the various combinations of letters he used to represent the names or titles of the characters who speak, that provide some of the most promising evidence for examining whether or not a given quarto served as the basic setting copy for William Jaggard's first collected edition—a question that continues to plague the textual analysis of plays like 2 Henry IV, Othello, Hamlet, and King Lear. A few scholars have had recourse to such evidence in attempts to distinguish pages set by B from those set by other compositors, chiefly E. More important, however, and more neglected, has been Fredson Bowers' suggestion that these 'appurtenances' provide 'evidence about the nature of the underlying Folio copy' which 'can be evaluated with some confidence'. The proposition he develops is that B, like other compositors, was 'conservative in the treatment of names and titles' not only in stage-directions but in speech-prefixes, especially on their earlier appearances. Furthermore, Bowers argues, in the latter 'variation in the forms of names and titles… including even some variant spelling of the names' will usually reflect the variability of B's manuscript copy, despite his tendency to repeat the form of an immediately preceding stage-direction and to prefer shorter forms to longer ones. 3 3.

Although Bowers' approach to both plays is similar, the conclusions drawn are actually quite different. The analyses of both plays are more complicated of course than this summary indicates, owing largely to the argument that certain instances of variation cannot be compositorial because the order in which the workmen encountered the speech-prefixes when setting by formes led to dislocation and discontinuity. For the use of speech-prefixes in compositor determination, see, for example, T. H. Howard- Hill, 'New Light on Compositor E of the Shakespeare First Folio', The Library VI, 2 (1980), 167–170, based in part on his 'Compositors B and E in the Shakespeare First Folio and Some Recent Studies' (Columbia, S.C.: duplicated TS, 1976); Gary Taylor, 'The Shrinking Composi- tor A of the Shakespeare First Folio', SB 34 (1981), 96–117 (pp. 104, 107–108); and Reid, 'B and "J": Two Compositors in Two Plays of the Shakespeare First Folio', The Library VI, 7 (1985), 126–136 (p. 128). The identification of B's partner in the two Henry IV plays as 'J' has not been fully accepted, even in the Oxford Edition, and here he is referred to as 'J/A'. The conclusion that the variable speech-prefixes in the Folio texts of All's Well that Ends Well and Julius Caesar do not represent the compositors' own 'predilections', but rather reflect the manuscripts behind them, has important implications for assessing the character of other Folio manu- scripts. Yet the hypothesis itself, which has potential application to printed copy as well, remains untested because the manuscripts themselves have perished. The survival of examples of the quartos used by B and his partners to set up seven Folio plays offers the opportunity to examine the proposition that, under most circumstances and with certain qualifications, he faithfully followed his copy's speech-prefixes. Compositor B's pages in these Folio plays 4 4. The pages are those in Much Ado about Nothing, Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, 1 Henry IV, Titus Andronicus , and Romeo and Juliet assigned to B by Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), II, passim, supplemented by T.

Hinman's study also provides the order of formes through the press followed here. indicate that the proposition is es- sentially sound and, in particular, that when speech-prefixes containing complete names appear in his work, they almost certainly derive from B's copy. However, the reliability of the evidence must be defined not only in the context of B's gen- eral practices and tendencies in setting speech-prefixes, but also by reference to some specific techniques he employed in handling the forms of his quarto copy, especially under the influence of justification and of nearby stage-directions. I A quick survey of his speech-prefixes in these seven plays shows that, despite the length of the forms in his copy, B favored three-letter prefixes, was also open to setting four-letter forms, and was even not averse to producing some speech- prefixes with only two letters. The speech-prefixes in short lines (those not fill- ing the measure or even extending to within three ens of it) provide the most unequivocal evidence. 5 5. See Reid, 'Justification and Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B', SB 27 (1974), 91–111. More than 80 percent of B's prefixes in short lines run to three or four letters, and if those containing only two letters are also included in the count, the percentage jumps to well over 90. Short speech-prefixes are clearly what B generally preferred throughout the Folio (F). In this respect his general practice appears to have changed little over the two and one-half years he worked on this book. His preference for three-letter speech-prefixes is most evident in F's Com- edies. In Ado, LLL, MND , and MV , there are almost four times as many three- letter forms as four-letter. Moreover, if we exclude from consideration the two and one-half pages of Ado —in which B faced a number of relatively long speech- prefixes typical of Simmes's Compositor A 6 6. W. Craig Ferguson, Valentine Simmes … (Charlottesville, Va.: Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1968), pp. 27–28, 30–32, 35–37. and set one and one-half times as many four-letter forms ( 'Mess.', 'Leon.', 'Clau.', 'Iohn.' ) as three-letter ( 'Leo.', 'Bea.', 'Ben.' )—the proportion of three-letter to four-letter forms in the Comedies is a flat five to one. Thus MND is about typical of B's performance in the Comedies. It is dominated by 'Her.', 'The.', 'Dem.', 'Lys.', 'Hel.', and ' Dut. '; many of these reproduce the forms of quarto copy, but ' Lys. ' and ' Dut. ' also replace longer copy forms (' Lysan. ' or ' Lysand. ' and ' Dutch. '). On the other hand, even in the Comedies B is not so committed to speech- prefixes of three letters that he completely eschews those of four or of two. Besides setting a majority of four-letter forms in Ado , B once expands his copy's ' Fai. ' to ' Fair. ' in MND and reproduces Q2's ' Quin.', 'This.', 'Wall.', 'Lyon. ', and ' Moon. '. In LLL , though favoring 'Ber.', 'Dum.', 'Mar.', 'Lon.', 'Ros.', 'Kin.', and ' Ped. ', he retains 2 of Q's 3 ' Mari. ', 4 of its 9 ' Long. ', 5 of its 12 ' Rosa. ', 8 of its 21 ' King. ', and all 11 of its ' Brag. '. In MV he changes to ' Bas. ' half of the dozen ' Bass. ' found in Q1, but he reproduces the other half dozen four-letter forms even after having regularized others to the shorter form. Likewise, he reproduces a single ' Anth. ' from Q1 despite his already established preference for 'Ant. '. The Comedies thus exhibit B's tolerance for four-letter speech-prefixes as well as his stronger prefer- ence for forms of three letters. Furthermore, LLL and MND especially display his use, though limited, of certain two-letter speech-prefixes, which generally belong to one of two groups of analogous forms (see below in section I). In F's Histories and Tragedies, speech-prefixes of three and four letters, along with a smattering of two-letter forms, continue to dominate the pages studied here. Although the raw statistics do not suggest as strong a preference for three- letter forms as in the Comedies, the particular features of the texts and other circumstances indicate that there was no appreciable shift in B's practices in these later Folio plays. It is true that in 1 Henry IV , where B set 117 (+15NL+75L) 7 7. The symbols NL and L following the numbers identify nearly long lines (ending within three or fewer ens of the measure) and long (or full-measure) lines. Line numbers unattached to act and scene numbers are those of the through-line-numbering (TLN) system used in Charlton Hinman's The First Folio of Shakespeare: The Norton Facsimile (New York: Norton, 1968). Quota- tions of F are taken from this facsimile edition. three- letter speech-prefixes and 91 (+14NL+83L) four-letter, the three-letter forms out- number the four-letter by the small factor of 1.3 to 1, as compared to 3.7 to 1 in the Comedies. And it is also true that in his three and one-half pages of Tit. and Rom ., B set 10 (+3NL+10L) three-letter speech-prefixes and 17 (+4NL+15L) four-letter, thus apparently abandoning his former practice and using the longer form almost twice as often. However, even though these raw statistics suggest an increasingly decided shift to four-letter forms, the nature of the speech-prefixes indicates that no decisive shift occurred. Four characters— 'King.', 'Prin.', 'Poin. ', and ' Fran. '—occur so frequently in B's pages of 1H4 that together they account for B's apparent gravitation to speech-prefixes of four letters in the course of setting F. With the exception of one ' Kin. ' in a long line of Q5 (3019L), B found only ' King. ' in his copy and repro- duced all but one of its 13 (+6NL+4L) long forms, shortening to ' Kin. ' only once. Since in LLL he had already displayed a tendency to reproduce his copy's ' King. ' despite his preference for ' Kin. ', his prefixes in 1H4 suggest that this preference had not been reversed but merely weakened, probably as a result of his continual exposure to ' King. ' in the copy for the Histories. 8 8. After sig. b6 v of Richard II , the long form dominates B's remaining pages of the Histories and Tragedies; see Howard-Hill, 'New Light', p. 169. Whether Q3 or Q5 (or both) served as copy for R2 , B saw virtually nothing but the full form of ' King .' when he set this play, and it is not unlikely that the manuscripts of the Henry VI plays were also dominated by the full form and helped reinforce the impression made on B by his copy for Richard II . The increase in the proportion of ' King .' forms accepted by B can be traced to two long-standing habits which made him peculiarly susceptible to the influ- ence of his copy's virtually uniform ' King. '. First, even in the Comedies his work exhibits a general though secondary inclination to set speech-prefixes of four letters, of which there are a total of 135 (67+6NL+62L) in the seventeen pages of four plays. More particularly, he displays throughout F a tendency to retain full forms of names like 'Duke.', 'Iohn.', 'Hero.', 'Wall.', 'Lyon.', 'Page. ', and even 'Claudio.', 'Borachio.', 'Boyet.', 'Egeus. ', and 'Nerissa. '. (More on this practice in section III below.) Together with the preponderance of ' King. ' forms in his copy for R2 and possibly in the various copy for the other Histories set before 1 Henry IV , these two tendencies of B's probably combined to make him more disposed than in the Comedies to retain his copy's ' King. ' Still more numerically dominant than ' King. ' in B's share of 1H4 are the analogous speech-prefixes 'Prin.', 'Poin. ', and ' Fran. '. B's pages have a total of 46 instances of ' Prin. ' in short lines and another 47 in long or nearly long lines; of these 93, more than one-third replace longer forms (e.g., ' Prince. '), while the remainder duplicate Q5's ' Prin. '. The number of ' Poin. ', or ' Poyn. ', forms (11+7L) is comparable to the number of ' King. ', as is the number of ' Fran. ' (10+4L). Why B preferred these forms, not only to the longer ones which he periodically found in his copy but also to their shorter alternatives, is not altogether clear. However, it is a fact that he often eschewed three-letter speech-prefixes that end in a vowel even in the Comedies. For instance, his ' Leon. ' accounts in part for the higher proportion of four-letter speech-prefixes in Ado than in the other three Comedies; when setting the first page of this play B shortened Q's ' Leona. ' to ' Leon. ' in the first two instances, then followed its ' Leo. ' in the next three, and finally settled on ' Leon. ' for subsequent speech-prefixes, where Q had either ' Leonato. ' or ' Leo. '. Likewise, he followed Q's ' Brag. ' 11 times in LLL , though setting ' Du. ' 5 times, ' Boy. ' or ' Boi. ' 12, and ' Clo. ' 9. 9 9. The ' Du. ' forms comprise a somewhat special case (see below in section I); the possible four-letter abbreviations for Boyet offered no alternative to a final vowel. It may be that ' Brag. ' merely reflects the influ- ence of Q copy on B rather than his disposition to eschew three-letter prefixes ending in a vowel, but ' Leon. ' at least seems to betray an actual compositorial preference. Whether the influence of copy or an instinctive attraction to ending abbrevi- ated speech-prefixes with - n rather than a vowel led B to prefer 'Prin.', 'Poin. ', and ' Fran. ', these speech-prefixes, along with the dozen instances of ' King. ', largely account for the higher proportion of four-letter forms in 1H4 than in the Com- edies. Nonetheless, it is a fact that in this play B also set 19 ' Fal. ' (13 instead of Q5's ' Fals. '), 20 ' Wor. ', 5 ' Nor. ', and 45 ' Hot. '. Hence, his general habit of setting speech-prefixes either with three or four letters apparently continued in 1 Henry IV , even though the raw statistics seem to suggest an increasing tolerance of the latter. In the few pages of the Tragedies which B set from known prints, the raw totals may again be misleading in their indication of a stronger leaning towards speech-prefixes of four letters. The evidence for such an inclination is all in Rom . but is not convincing. B's one and one-half pages have a sufficient number of four-letter speech-prefixes to suggest a shift in his practice: a quick glance finds 'Greg.', 'Samp.', and ' Abra. ' recurring in the first page (ee3), ' Prin. ' repeated in the second (Gg1), and ' Moun. ' in both. Yet in view of his performance in 1 Henry IV , B's 2 (+2L) ' Prin. ' prefixes are hardly surprising, especially since they reproduce Q3 forms. Furthermore, analysis shows (1) that the 1 (+1L) ' Moun. ' is another speech-prefix ending in -n which preserves the copy form; (2) that all 5 (+1NL+6L) ' Samp. ' reproduce Q3 forms and that in 2 (+4L) instances B reduces Q3's ' Samp. ' to ' Sam. '; (3) that all 5 ' Abra. ' duplicate Q3's speech-prefixes; and (4) that B's ' Greg. ' is analogous to the ' Brag. ' forms of LLL , that it reproduces Q3's ' Greg. ' 1 (+1NL+3L) times, that it replaces Q3's ' Grego. ' 2 (+1NL) times, and that Q3's ' Gre. ' is retained in 2 (+1NL) instances. The only hard evidence, then, of B's actually preferring speech-prefixes of four letters to those of three in the Tragedies is the 1 (+1L) example of his changing Q3's ' Gre. ' to ' Greg. '. 10 10. See TLN 51, 23L. These alterations probably reflect B's tendency to regularize the pre- fixes of a given play and thus, indirectly, the early influence of Q3's ' Greg. '; both are also directly above other four-letter forms (' Samp. ' and ' Abra. ') and thus contribute to the typographical neatness mentioned below. They are not persuasive evidence of an increasing preference for speech-prefixes of four letters in the Tragedies. Folio Tit. more clearly represents B's continuing practice. Dominated by very long speech- prefixes that mimic those of Q3, its only four-letter form (' Aron. ') occurs in a long line and reproduces that of B's copy, whereas B's one and one-half pages contain 2 (+2NL+1L) three-letter speech-prefixes which shorten longer copy forms ( 'Lu- cius.', 'Marc.', 'Puer. '). 11 11. The change of this last to ' Boy. ' (2676) may well reflect editorial annotation more than B's practice. The pages of the four Comedies, one History, and two Tragedies in which B set varying amounts of type from known printed copy are fairly consistent in their implications. Although the raw evidence can sometimes be deceptive, it indicates that B favored shorter speech-prefixes to longer ones throughout F. It also suggests that his primary preference was for speech-prefixes of three letters and that he had throughout a secondary bias for those of four letters, though various circumstances led him to tolerate the latter increasingly as the printing of the Folio progressed. The evidence of these seven plays thus generally confirms earlier inferences that shorter speech-prefixes are typical of B and that longer ones indicate the influence of copy or of other factors on his work. However, it would be imprecise to characterize B's preference as one for 'maximally abbreviated forms'. 12 12. Bowers, 'Foul Papers', p. 67, n. 14. Only a small portion of B's speech-prefixes in these seven plays could be construed as fitting that description: Ado: Bea., Ben., Leo. LLL: Qu., Du., Ka., La. MND: Qu., Du., Ob., Dut., Her., Hel. MV: An., Du. 1H4: La. Rom.: Gr. Yet not all of these are the forms that B either settled upon as his standards or at least was inclined to favor. A few of them he either adopted briefly and then quickly abandoned for longer ones (e.g., ' Du. ' and ' Ka. ' in LLL ), or retained from his copy despite his established preference for a longer form (e.g., ' Leo. ' in Ado, 'An. ' in MV ). The remainder, which do seem to represent B's genuine preferences, fall roughly into two categories. The first is probably the more sig- nificant and comprises two groups: (a) speech-prefixes ending with -u , like ' Qu. ' (for Queen) and ' Du. ' (for Duke), and (b) those ending with -a , like ' La. ' (for Lady) and ' Bea. ' (for Beatrice). The second category is associated with a few three-letter speech-prefixes, such as ' Ben. ' in Ado and 'Dut.', 'Her.', 'Hel. ' in MND , which may be classified as 'maximally abbreviated' only because these characters' opposite numbers ( 'Bea.', 'Du.', 'Hel.', 'Her. ') would have been confused with them had B adopted shorter forms. Along with ' Ob. ', the forms belonging to these two cat- egories constitute a limited and by no means typical class of speech-prefixes in Compositor B's pages. In contrast to this relatively small number of maximally abbreviated forms stands a larger number of prefixes for which B settled on forms containing an additional letter or two when still shorter ones would have been sufficient to distinguish the characters. Sometimes he deliberately rejected the shorter forms of his copy by setting longer ones: ' Leon. ' ( Ado ), ' Ber. ' ( LLL ), ' Fair. ' ( MND ), ' Ant. ' ( MV ), 'Poin.', 'Bard. ' ( 1H4 ), ' Greg. ' ( Rom. ) More frequently, he early opted for a speech-prefix of three or four letters despite the fact that a shorter alternative was an obvious expedient. He set the following where a shorter speech-prefix was a realistic possibility: Ado: Mess., Hero., Pedro., Iohn., Clau., Fri. LLL: Dum., Lon(g)., Brag. MND: Quin., Dem., This., Wall., Moon. MV: Gra., Ner., Por. 1H4: West., King., Prin., Vint., Peto., Theeues., Iohn., Host. Tit.: Bassia. Rom.: Abra., Tyb., Wife., Prin. What would have been the 'maximally abbreviated form' in a given case is no doubt a matter of definition, or supposition. But in any event, the use of the minimum number of letters necessary to identify a speaker was not a firm rule for B. Instead, with the exceptions already noted (e.g., 'Qu.', 'Du.', 'La.', 'Bea. '), he seems to have preferred speech-prefixes of three or four letters closed by a consonant following a vowel. It is this practice that in some part helped create the impression of typographical neatness and professional competence which characterizes his work. II With B's general practice of setting speech-prefixes established, we can now examine a few of his more specific methods of handling the forms of his quarto copy. Both an immediately preceding stage-direction and line justification might lead B to depart from the form that he preferred for a given speaker. But of more importance than these specific influences is the manner in which B de- veloped such preferred forms, especially since he usually began setting a play in the middle of a scene, rather than at its beginning. Although the influence of justification and of stage-directions cannot be ignored in any close analysis of B's particular habits, it is best to consider first his manner of settling on preferred forms. Evaluation of particular speech-prefixes needs to take place against the background of this practice. The evidence suggests that B sometimes required repeated exposure to a character before he found a standard form for a speech-prefix. Less frequently he established a standard form on his first encounter with a character, even though the speech-prefixes, stage-directions, and dialogue in the immediate con- text failed to reveal the character's name. In Love's Labour's Lost , for instance, B's speech-prefixes for Longaville show how he gradually developed a preferred form in the face of conflicting copy forms and despite the exigencies of line justification. His Q1 copy was dominated by ' Long. ', and on sig. M4, his first page of the play, B reproduced this form the first four times he set speeches for this character. The fifth instance of the speech- prefix on this page almost surely exhibits the influence of justification, for there B lengthened his copy's ' Lon. ' to ' Long. ' in a verse line which he was forced to turn over and word-space more liberally than usually (2166–67). Finally, in the last occurrence of the name on M4 (2170), B shortened Q1's ' Long. ' to ' Lon. ' Thereafter, ' Lon. ' was his preferred form. Three pages later, while setting M5 v , B again encountered Longaville and shortened 4 of Q1's 5 ' Long. ' speech-prefixes to ' Lon. ', reproducing only one. On M6 he again substituted ' Lon. ' for ' Long. ' the single time the latter appeared in his copy, and on M6 v he regularized both ' Longauill. ' and ' Long. ' to ' Lon. '. His manner of establishing a standard speech-prefix of three or four letters followed essentially the same pattern in the other Comedies. In Ado , for example, several conditions combined to postpone but not to prevent his development of a preferred speech-prefix for Beatrice. B set two and a half pages of this play, the opening page in prose (I3), the second column of I5 (also prose), and all of K4 (verse). It was not until he neared the bottom of I3b that he felt sufficiently sure of Beatrice's identity to settle on ' Bea. ' as his standard speech-prefix. Nonetheless, in his later pages the influence of copy forms and interruption of his work on the play twice induced him to abandon this form. 13 13. For details, see the appended Note A. The speech-prefixes for this char- acter show that alternation between plays and his copy's longer forms, as well as the exigencies of justification, could sometimes work together to inhibit B's general tendency to establish a standard speech-prefix of three or four letters. This general inclination of B's, affected as it was by various circumstances, may be observed in several speech-prefixes in the Histories and the Tragedies which he set from identified quartos. His speech-prefixes for Northumberland are perhaps typical. When setting d6 v he found one ' Nor. ' and then one ' Nort. ' in his copy (335, 344); B retained the first, and he expanded the second to ' North. ', perhaps with reference to an earlier stage-direction (320). The next five speech- prefixes for this character all appeared as the simple ' Nor. ' in Q5, which B repro- duced without fail in e2 and in e1 v . In setting the penultimate line of the latter page, B came upon Q5's ' North. ', but by this time his exposure to the dialogue between the lord, his brother, and his son in I.iii had made the compositor fa- miliar enough with the character that he regularized this speech-prefix to ' Nor. '. That form he used in the three remaining instances of the name, all in e1 (two of them in long lines). Although B quickly fixed on standard speech-prefixes for this character partly as a result of his own inclinations and partly with the support of the forms he early found in his copy, he had more difficulty settling on one for Poins, because the shifting forms of Q5 frustrated his attempt to develop ' Poin. ' as his stan- dard tag. Q5 exhibited bedazzling variability on B's early acquaintance with this character. His first encounter with the speech-prefix for Poins, at the bottom of d6, involved confusing circumstances and probably editorial annotation. 14 14. The appended Note B discusses these complexities and other details. Then, while setting d6 v , B came to identify Hal's sidekick and developed a tendency to use for him a four-letter prefix ending in -n , but Q5's alternation of forms, espe- cially its almost exclusive use of ' Poy. ' and ' Po. ' after the first two examples on the page, diverted B from his inclination to use ' Poin. '. However, his next page (e3 v ), occupied wholly by the early part of the great tavern scene) contained a number of speeches for the same character; here B found Q5 virtually uniform in printing ' Poines. ', and he quickly fixed on ' Poin. ' as his own preferred form, which he used in his remaining pages of the play with only an occasional reten- tion of Q5's ' Poines. ' or ' Poynes. ' (often soon after a stage-direction naming the character). B's experience with Poins and Northumberland illustrates not only his inclination to settle on a prefix of three or four letters once he had identi- fied a character, but also the influence which the forms of his copy exerted on him, sometimes reinforcing this inclination, sometimes thwarting his attempt to develop a preferred form. The speech-prefixes in the Tragedies which display this same inclination most clearly are those for Sampson in the opening page of Romeo and Juliet. Except for a ' Sa. ' in a justified line of Q3 (TLN 53), B's copy had only ' Samp. ' prefixes. In the first two-thirds of column a of ee3, B followed Q3's lead, retain- ing ' Samp. ' in the first six instances, substituting ' Sam. ' once to justify a line (28L), and then reproducing ' Samp. ' in the next speech in a shorter line (31). After a stage-direction introducing ' two other Seruingmen ' (Abraham and a mute), and after another justified ' Sam. ' (37L), B began to adopt the shorter ' Sam. ' as his standard speech-prefix: he changed 5 of Q3's next 8 ' Samp. ' forms to ' Sam. ' and altered 1 ' Sa. ' to ' Sam. ' (53L), though he also retained 3 of Q3's ' Samp. ' prefixes, one of them (59L) probably under the influence of justification. In short, not only in the Comedies and the Histories but also apparently in the Tragedies, B's normal practice was to settle on a standard speech-prefix of three or four letters as soon as he was familiar with a character. Although this practice was often affected by the forms of his copy, sometimes by the forms of preceding stage-directions or by his need to justify his lines, and occasionally by alternation between plays or disjunctions in his copy for a single play, the strength of this predisposition of B's should not be underestimated. It sometimes led him to abbreviate to a short form on his very first exposure to a character. In LLL B first encountered Maria in the last line of Q1's sig. G4 v and promptly shortened it to ' Mar. ' (TLN 2148, sig. M4 in F). This immediate change was then reinforced on the following pages by Q1's frequent ' Mar. ', but here B also continued to regularize his copy's periodic ' Mari. ' and ' Maria. ' to ' Mar. '. That is, he continued to do so until he had come upon ' Marcad. ' when setting M6: there he reduced to ' Mar. ' the first two of Q1's ' Marcad. ' forms in short lines and set the third as ' Marc. ' in a long line. Consequently, when in the next page he again came upon Maria twice, he followed Q1's ' Maria. ' both times. This evidence suggests that Bowers ('Foul Papers', p. 80) is right in his conclusion that B was careful not to sacrifice details necessary to distinguish one character from another when abbreviating speech-prefixes. But his handling of Maria's prefixes also shows the strength of his inclination to shorten them. The same inclination is exhibited elsewhere in B's pages of LLL . It is seen in (1) his immediate substitution of ' Qu. ' for Q1's ' Quee. ' in the very first prefix on M4, despite the lack of guidance as to the identity of the character from any source (the dialogue or a stage-direction) other than the speech-prefix itself; (2) B's immediate adoption of his uniform ' Ber. ' for Q1's favored ' Bero. ' begin- ning in the second line of M4 and for its less frequent ' Berow. ' (as well as ' Ber. ') from there on; (3) his reduction of Q1's ' Kath. ' first to ' Ka. ' and then to ' Kat. '; and (4) his shortening to ' Ped. ' of Q1's ' Peda. ' (or, later, ' Pedan. ') upon his first encoun- ter with that character and subsequently without exception. Two other Comedies exhibit B's precipitation in shortening speech-prefixes. In MND , aside from frequently retaining Q2 prefixes like 'Bot.', 'Her.', 'The.', and ' Hel. ', he immediately reduced ' Dutch. ' to ' Dut. ' on sig. O3, carefully distin- guishing her from ' Du. ' (Theseus). He followed a similar procedure in MV when he shortened ' Bass. ' to ' Bas. ' without any guidance to the name of the character in the preceding dialogue that he set on O4 v , though later he retained some of Q1's ' Bass. ' forms. B was even quicker to find a standard form for Prince Hal. He altered to ' Prin. ' the second of Q5's ' Prince. ' speech-prefixes which he came upon when set- ting d6 (TLN 133), and thereafter he used this four-letter form almost exclusively, regardless of whether his copy had it or the longer ' Prince. '. In his fifteen pages of this play, only occasionally did B set ' Prince. ' or ' Pri. '—as at 841L, where after a stage-direction containing 'Prince' he substituted the prefix ' Prince. ' for his copy's ' Prin. ', or at 2934L, where in a full verse line ' Pri. ' replaces Q5's ' Prin. '. In but one page did B temporarily abandon his preference to set another form succes- sively, and then apparently under special circumstances (see section III below). In B's speech-prefixes for other characters the same proclivity to immedi- ate abbreviation is evident, though it is possible in these cases that either the dialogue, preceding stage-directions, or his copy's prefixes themselves made B aware of the name of the character. For instance, when beginning his second page of Ado (I5b), B immediately shortened Q's ' Bene. ' to ' Ben. ' (558), even before encountering Don John's question to Claudio, 'Are you not signior Benedicke?' (567) and Q's stage-direction ' Enter Benedicke ' (590). It is perhaps possible that B remembered the name of this character from the long stage-direction which he had set at the end of I3, though Benedick does not have a speech there (91). However, since discontinuity in his setting of Ado apparently occasioned a lapse in his memory of Beatrice (who has many speeches on I3), that possibility is re- mote, and the likelihood is greater that B's first ' Ben. ' is another example of his blind shortening of speech-prefixes if not his preference for those ending in -n rather than a vowel. 15 15. See Appendix, Note A. It could be argued that before setting this prefix B's eye dropped lower on Q's page and caught the name in Don John's speech. Such speculation might of course be made about any of the prefixes cited in the three preceding paragraphs, but in this particular instance it is even more beside the point because the complicated action of the masking scene (II.i) with its assumed identities would have left B more than ordinarily unsure of who was who. In other instances B's information about the identity of a speaker was more immediately at hand. When, having previously set only its first page (CC4), he resumed work on Tit . with the last one (ee2 v ), B reduced ' Lucius. ' to ' Luc. ' and ' Marc. ' to ' Mar. ' in the first two speech-prefixes on this part-page; the tag itself supplied B with the complete name in the first instance, though Marcus identified himself only in the second line of his speech. Elsewhere, either the speech-prefixes themselves or accompanying stage-directions or dialogue provided the names of characters when B first came upon them: in MV he abbreviated Q1's ' Loren. ' to ' Lor. ' and ' Portia. ' to ' Por. ' without further ado (informed by dialogue and the pre- fix); in MND he shortened Q2's ' Queene. ' to ' Qu. ' and ' Robin. ' to ' Rob. ' when first setting prefixes for these characters (stage-directions giving their names in full); in 1H4 , he substituted ' Fal. ' for Q5's ' Fals. ' and ' Dow. ' for ' Dowg. ' immediately (stage-directions); on his first page of Rom ., he shortened Q3's first ' Benu. ' to ' Ben. ' and abbreviated its ' Tibalt. ' to ' Tyb. ' (stage-direction and speech-prefix). Often, then, B found the full name of a character in a preceding stage- direction, the immediate dialogue, or his copy's speech-prefix itself when he undertook to abbreviate the first tag for a given character. Nevertheless, in his work on four Comedies, one History, and two Tragedies, there is evidence of varying value that B's inclination to abbreviate speech-prefixes was sometimes so strong that he would fix on a short form, despite the form of his copy, when setting his very first for a character. If it is true that the speech-prefixes of his copy did not always effectively in- fluence B to reproduce the form he found there while he was becoming familiar with a given character, it is also true that many of his speech-prefixes in long, or full-measure, lines were not affected by justification. A glance at the numbers in the appended table (Note D) suggests that remarkably few of B's prefixes in long lines find no precedents in short lines and that most of his forms in long lines exhibit the general practices already described. B's clearly preferred forms appear not only in short lines, but also in long and nearly long lines which otherwise display the effects of justification on his normal practice. 16 16. On his general justification practices see Reid, 'Justification and Spelling'. For example, on sig. f5 of 1H4 , he set the complete ' King. ' in a very full line (2988L) that otherwise exhibits crowding in the shortened 'hart' at the end of the line and in the lack of B's characteristic spacing after punctuation. Indeed, there is no spacing after the point which concludes the speech-prefix itself; this omission is contrary to one of B's most regular practices, that of setting at least a one-en space between a prefix and the first word of dialogue. Earlier in the same column B set ' Prin. ' in a nearly long line of verse (2968NL) which otherwise shows crowding to prevent flow-over, especially in the omission of spacing after punctuation (including, again, the point that ends the speech-prefix itself). Like- wise, in Tit . both ' Aron. ' (2688L) and ' Lucius. ' (2695L) are speech-prefixes that display B's general practices in the face of pressures to justify. Both are in long verse lines which B could have allowed to flow over but which he wished to keep to one line in this part-page for purposes of formatting. ' Aron. ' reproduces the full form of Q3 despite B's substitution of '&amp;' for its 'and' as well as the absence of his usual comma spacing later in the line. ' Lucius. ' also reproduces Q3's full form even though in the speech itself B used the unsightly 'Emp.' to abbreviate 'Emperour', the penultimate word of the line. Thus neither speech-prefix was affected by the anticipatory justification frequently found in the long lines that often open verse speeches set by B; rather, each is typical of his normal practices. These are perhaps the most unambiguous instances of B's adherence to his usual practices for setting speech-prefixes in the face of the influence of justification, but they are by no means uncommon. Nevertheless, a relatively small number of B's speech-prefixes do exhibit the effects of line justification. Some of these justified prefixes occur in prose. ' Bea. ', in the first page of Ado (32L), is one possibility (see Appendix, Note A). In the first page of Rom ., two instances of ' Gr. ' substituted for Q3's ' Gre. ' in long lines betray justification. B's preferred form almost from the beginning was ' Greg. ', but in TLN 42L he set ' Gr. ', besides (1) omitting all spacing after internal points (including that for the prefix), (2) omitting the full-stop at the end of the line, and (3) abbreviating with the generally eschewed forms 'thẽ', '&amp;', and 'wil'. Another ' Gr. ' (56L) appears in a line which also lacks spacing after punctuation (including the speech-prefix point) and contains the non-preferred 'here'. Additionally, as already mentioned (above in section II), two ' Sam. ' speech-prefixes in this page occur in lines that display similar evidence of compression. More frequent than such prose lines are verse lines which contain short- ened speech-prefixes resulting, presumably, from anticipatory justification. For instance, in LLL B abandoned his well-established, standard ' Qu. ' and ' Dum. ' to set ' Q. ' and ' Du. ' (2275L, 2743L) in long lines. On f5 of 1H4 , he set ' Pri. ' instead of Q5's ' Prince. ' in a full-measure line of verse that lacks spacing after punctuation (including the speech-prefix point) and that contains 'here' (2934L), while earlier he set ' Blu. ' for Q5's ' Blunt. ' (which B normally retained) in a line that is similarly spaced and that contains the ligature , one of the most reli- able signs of B's compression (2892L). His ' K. ' for Q5's ' Kin. ' on the next page of 1H4 (3019L) and his ' Fai. ' and ' De. ' in MND (376L, 2941NL) also exhibit the influence of justification, and several other speech-prefixes may possibly do so. Justification, then, sometimes led B to shorten speech-prefixes, especially in long or nearly long verse lines. 17 17. See also Ado , TLN 62L, 75L; LLL , 2321–22L; MND , 400NL, 2018L; 1H4 , 2902NL, 2973L. Even smaller is the number of B's speech-prefixes lengthened for such ty- pographical reasons. In fact, there are only three in the seven plays studied here. Although in different formes, all three occur in B's last few pages of 1H4 (f4 v –5 v ), and all three concern Falstaff, who is identified as ' Falst. ' instead of Q5's ' Fal. ' or ' Fals. '. Two of these expanded speech-prefixes are in long prose lines that contain long spellings (e.g., 'bee', 'mee') and liberal word-spacing, especially after commas (2766L, 3077L). The third is in a nearly long line displaying the same sort of spacing but exactly reproducing Q5's faulty verse lineation (2944NL). However, there is some uncertainty about the extent to which these three ' Falst. ' forms were the effect of justification alone. In f2, set at about the same time, B used three other ' Falst. ' speech-prefixes in long lines that exhibit crowding rather than expansion; these three longer forms cannot, therefore, be attributed to justification and apparently represent a temporary lapse from his preferred ' Fal. '. 18 18. As does that in 2143L, a line not particularly compressed. See section II below for more on this question. Consequently, it may have been this short-lived and weak flirtation with ' Falst. ' as well as the pressures of justification which thrice led B to lengthen his usual ' Fal. ' in f4 v –5 v . Other possible evidence that B set long speech-prefixes to justify his lines is even less persuasive, 19 19. For instance, one additional long speech-prefix, B's ' Samp. ' ( Rom ., 59L), reproduces copy's form but in a line with ample word-spacing that might possibly suggest justification of the tag: the evidence is not decisive. and it is not comparable in quality to the relatively sparse evidence, already cited, that B did sometimes shorten his speech-prefixes to fit a type line to the Folio measure. But throughout F the proportion of prefixes so influenced is relatively small. In sum, although exceptions are likely to occur and must be allowed for, even speech-prefixes in full-measure lines, especially the longer forms, will by and large exhibit B's general practices of handling these 'appurtenances'. One other influence on B's speech-prefixes might have come from the forms of names found in immediately preceding stage-directions. There is some slight evidence that such influence did sometimes occur. The clearest instance is again in 1 Henry IV , where on e2 v B substituted the prefix ' Prince. ' for Q5's ' Prin. ' (841), thus rejecting the form he had already adopted as his own standard. This speech- prefix immediately follows the stage-direction ' As they are sharing, the Prince and Poynes set upon them '. Two other examples in the same play are more complex because the stage-direction does not immediately precede the speech-prefix in question. These are the two cases of ' Pointz. ' at the end of d6 which replace Q5's ' Poines. ', once in a normal prefix, once in a catch-word. As explained elsewhere (Appendix, Note B), the first Folio speech-prefix (214) comes after a Q5 stage- direction (' Enter Poines ') that was apparently deleted editorially, the addition of ' and Pointz ' to the opening stage-direction (114) compensating for the later cut. Since these two are the only ' Pointz. ' prefixes that B set in the play, it is difficult not to believe that the forms ultimately derived from the annotation for the earlier stage-direction, which for some reason must have impressed itself on B's mind. Altogether, then, in the seven plays studied here there are only three speech- prefixes which show B rejecting the forms of his copy in favor of those found in preceding stage-directions. They suggest that B sometimes made a deliberate connection between a character's speeches and his entrance as represented in a stage-direction. In a few other instances such a connection may in part lie behind B's retention of long speech-prefixes (e.g., ' Prince.', 'Poines.', 'Bassianus. ') from his copy soon after the full name of the character appeared in an entry ( 1H4 , 116L, 736L, 831, 968, 3097; Tit ., 15). Yet in these instances other factors were probably more responsible for B's reproduction of his copy's forms, including not only the influence of justification, but his general liability to reproduce such long copy forms under ordinary circumstances. III Indeed, what is perhaps most interesting about B's handling of speech-prefixes is his disposition to reproduce certain forms of his copy despite his preferences for alternative forms. That B's speech-prefixes were liable to be influenced by those of his copy is the premise behind Bowers' arguments that the variable designations for the same characters in different scenes of All's Well that Ends Well (e.g., forms of Rossillon and of Bertram) reflect the variable usage of the Shakespearian foul-papers which served as printer's copy for this Folio play, and further that B's use of ' Cassi .' and of ' Cass. '/' Cas. ' in different episodes of Julius Caesar reveals the presence of two different hands in the manuscript behind that play. The evidence of the seven plays which B set from identified quartos gener- ally confirms the validity of this general premise, though not necessarily of its suggested implications for these plays. 20 20. It is, for instance, neutral on the problem of JC , complicated as that is by the need to distinguish Cassius from Casca and perhaps Cæsar and its frequent demand on special sorts; at different times both Bowers and Jowett accept the view that the long ' Cassi. ' rather than ' Cas. ', which Jowett once ('Ligature Shortage', p. 245) identifies as B's preferred variant in contrast to A's ' Cass. ', was the norm for the play. As with justification, typographical considerations would be likely to supersede orthographical ones in most contexts. Variable designations appear in two Comedies set from known quartos. In The Merchant of Venice , B's standard form for Shylock was, from the outset, ' Iew. '. While setting IV.i (the court scene), he continued this practice. Not only did he use ' Iew. ' exclusively where Q1 varied between ' Iewe. ' and ' Iew. ', but he also set it five times where Q1 reads ' Shy. '. However, twice B followed Qq's ' Shy. ', contrary to his established preference. 21 21. See Kennedy, pp. 191–199, who has traced this quarto speech-prefix to type shortage, with the result that B's two identical forms constitute bibliographical links. In MND Q2's name for Theseus varies between ' The. ' and ' Duke. '. B followed his copy's ' The. ' all 4 (+4L) times in the first scene. But in setting the last scene of the play he followed Q2's ' Duke. ', though varying the length of the speech-prefix slightly by setting ' Duke. ' (1) and ' Duk. ' (1L), as well as his usual ' Du. '. He also precisely reproduced Q2's ' Pir. ' and ' Pyr. '. As for B's use of longer but not full forms of a given name, one of the more interesting cases is his ' Beatr. ' at the top of K4 ( Ado ). 22 22. See Appendix, Note A, for other factors bearing on B's retention of this form. This derives from Q's ' Beatrice. ' and was B's only such departure from his preference for ' Bea. ' in Ado , though elsewhere he displayed his tolerance for Q's ' Beat. '. In MV he likewise re- tained one ' Anth. ' from Q1 despite his well-established preference for the shorter ' Ant. '; he also reproduced half (6+1NL+3L) of Q1's ' Bass. ' forms, after having settled on ' Bas. ' as his standard in the face of Q1's uniform ' Bass. '. 23 23. These forms do not seem to be determined by ligature shortage, as Jowett argues was the case in the variation between ' Cas(s). ' and ' Cassi. ' in JC . Furthermore, he followed copy forms like ' P.Ioh. ' and ' Mess. ' in 1H4 and ' Samp. ' and ' Offi. ' in Rom.; as in the Comedies these copy forms appear in B's work in pages containing his expressed preference for a shorter prefix. Had the quartos which served as B's copy for Ado, MV, MND, 1H4 , and Rom . vanished, the inferences would have been accurate that speech-prefixes like ' Shy.', 'The.', 'Beatr. ', and ' Anth. ' reflected those of his lost copy. Yet in 1H4 there are 7 (1NL+6L) ' Falst. ' prefixes which would seem to contradict the implications of the evidence concerning longer forms, for they replace Q5's ' Fal. ' or its ' Fals. '. This conflicting evidence is, however, less forceful than it at first appears. As already argued, 3 (1NL+2L) of these ' Falst. ' forms can be put down largely to the influence of justification (section II above). The other 4 all appear close together in long lines in sig. f2. These aberrant instances of B's five-letter speech-prefixes where his copy has shorter ones would normally weaken the value of longer (but not full) speech-prefixes as indexes to the forms of his copy. But it may well be that, as Eleanor Prosser has argued, B was deliberately expanding his text in this page in every way possible and that consequently these four examples of ' Falst. ' are atypical and by no means indicative of his usual practices. 24 24. See Prosser, Shakespeare's Anonymous Editors: Scribe and Compositor in the Folio Text of 2 Henry IV (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford Univ. Press, 1981), pp. 70, 73, 202, n. 21. For more on this important study, see section IV and note 40 below. It is just possible that these forms were also encouraged by attraction to those for the Hostess (' Host. '), Falstaffe's partner in the dialogue here. Certainly the four full ' Prince. ' prefixes on the same page—in fact, in the same passage—suggest that here B had temporarily abandoned his normal practice, for whatever reason (see below). In assessing the implications of B's longer but not full speech-prefixes in other Folio plays, it will be necessary to allow for the kind of aberration exhibited in the four ' Falst. ' speech-prefixes clustered together at the beginning of f2. It will also be necessary to recognize that prefixes which are longer than B's normally preferred forms, but which are not complete names, might reproduce the forms of his copy imprecisely. Both ' Beatr. ' ( Ado ) and ' North. ' ( 1H4 ) were stimulated by the longer forms of B's copy, but neither duplicates his copy's prefix exactly. As with B's early retention of Q's ' Beat. ' and his unique ' North. ', longer pre- fixes derived from copy are more likely to occur in the pages B set while he was developing a standard form, whereas those, like ' Beatr. ', that were set after he had established a preference are likely to be less frequent though more unequivocal evidence of a shift in the forms of his copy. His prefixes for Sampson in Romeo and Juliet illustrate both parts of this generalization. Had Q3 not survived, the first six of B's ' Samp. ' prefixes in ee3, instead of being recognized as longish forms derived from copy, might have been explained away as B's flirtation with a four- letter standard form (as with ' Leon. ' in Ado or ' Greg. ' in Rom. ). 25 25. This explanation would have been faulty on other grounds, of course, for ' Leon. ' apparently reflects B's special disposition to four-letter forms ending in -n after a vowel, and ' Greg. ' a similar disposition displayed in the uniform ' Brag. ' of LLL; see section I above. But no such theory could be applied to the two unjustified ' Samp. ' that occur later in ee3 after B had established the shorter ' Sam. ' as his preference. These provisos admitted, by and large the evidence of B's pages studied here indicates that not only variable designations for a single character, but also speech-prefixes that are longer than one of his standard abbreviations reflect the variability of his copy. We are perhaps on somewhat surer grounds in making such an inference when different names (' Iew.', 'Shy. ') occur, than when a name remains the same but a longer (though not complete) form of it appears in B's work. Yet variable designations are likely to occur less frequently simply because a Folio editor might have noted and tinkered with such differences, rather than fussing with the extra letters of a prefix. In any event, either kind of variable speech-prefix in B's pages should provide relatively good evidence of the char- acteristics of his copy. Finally, the most useful of B's speech-prefixes are not his longer but his full forms, both because they are more frequent than the two kinds just discussed and because they are highly reliable witnesses to the speech-prefixes of his copy. In the four Comedies which B typeset from identified quartos, he set 63 speech- prefixes containing complete names. All but 3 derive from his copy, the excep- tions being ' Bottom. ' for ' Bot. ' in MND and ' Boyet. ' for ' Boye. ' and ' Boiet. ' for ' Boy. ' in LLL . Almost half of B's full forms consist of five or more letters (e.g., ' Pedro. ', ' Borachio.', 'Claudio.', 'Leonato.', 'Nerissa. '). The remainder are four-letter speech- prefixes (e.g., ' Duke.', 'Iohn.', 'Lyon.', 'King. '), which might appear to represent B's normal inclinations; yet he set such forms only when they occurred in his copy, and his actual preferences were often clearly for shorter forms of the names (e.g., ' Du.', 'Kin. '). In 1 Henry IV , the only play in the Histories universally acknowledged to have been set from an identified quarto, B generally used a full name in a speech-prefix only where his Q5 copy had such a form. This he did 37 times, reproducing speech-prefixes like ' Prince.', 'Poi(y)nes.', 'Iohn.', 'Blunt. ', and ' King. '. The first two contrast strikingly with the favored abbreviated forms that dominate his pages, whereas the other three are in the majority in B's pages, though there is evidence to suggest he was open to setting other alternatives. 26 26. See ' Kin. ' (2709), ' Blu. ' (2902NL) and ' P.Ioh. ' (2962), the first two set where Q5 has full names. ' King. ' dominates B's pages, perhaps for reasons already suggested (see section I and note 8 above). ' Iohn. ' and ' Blunt. ' each comprise half the speech-prefixes for these two char- acters; they are counter-balanced by two shorter forms—' Blu.', 'Ioh. ' (2892L, 2973L)—that almost certainly reflect justification and by the instances just cited. ' Blu. ' (2902L) might also be a justified form, but ' P.Ioh. ' (2962) unequivocally exhibits B's retention of longer, though not full, forms. Of chief interest are the full names for Hal and Poins, both because of their frequency and because B established clear preferences for the shorter ' Prin. ' and ' Poin. ', though in different manners (see section II above). The former was almost instinctive, the latter labo- riously developed, and consequently B's use of either of these full forms instead of its already established alternative provides strong evidence of his copy's forms that is analogous in kind to ' Beatr. ' and the two later instances of ' Samp. '. In B's fifteen pages of this play, there are only five examples of his use of a full form where his copy had an abbreviated speech-prefix, and all involve F's ' Prince. ' for Q5's ' Prin. ' or ' Pri. '. Of these five, four occur in sequence in f2, the only page in that quire, or indeed in the play, for which B was required to switch from his half of a quire in order to substitute for his partner and set up the forme-mate to his own assigned page (f5 v ). It will be recalled that the same page also contains the four aberrant ' Falst. ' speech-prefixes mentioned earlier. Two of the five anomalous ' Prince. ' forms (2138L, 2150L) are in long lines and in one-sentence speeches that flow-over to a second line of two or three words, and a plausible cause for them may be found in Prosser's conclusion that B was generally expanding his text on this page owing to underestimates of the matter during casting-off. Whether these two prefixes somehow induced B to set the other two full forms that follow them closely (2142, 2155) it is impossible to as- certain. As for the remaining aberrant ' Prince. ' (841L), it was probably occasioned by the complete name that B set up in the immediately preceding stage-direction (839), if not by justification as well. Thus there are no more than five instances of B's speech-prefix ' Prince. ' in 1H4 which belie the nature of his copy's speech- prefixes, and all but two are to some extent special cases. This number of anoma- lies compares rather favorably with the 37 instances in which B's full form derives from his copy, though a few of them might conceivably exhibit the influence of preceding stage-directions (116L, 736L, 968, 3097). That this particular practice of B's continued through his work on the Trag- edies is not easy to show because the evidence of the four part-pages of Tit . and Rom . is limited. Yet even these few pages contain six complete speech-prefixes that reproduce the forms of quarto copy and none that replaces a shorter form. For instance, one ' Prince. ' at the bottom of the opening page of Rom . (ee3) re- produces Q3's ' Prince. ', while four examples of B's ' Prin. ' on the last page (Gg1) succeed his copy's abbreviated form. Furthermore, B's work in Troilus and Cres- sida offers some supporting evidence of this practice in the Tragedies. In arguing that the Folio text was set from an annotated example of the 1609 quarto, Philip Williams used complete names in six speech-prefixes to show the influence of Q's forms on F, and two of these six are in B's pages. 27 27. 'Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida: The Relationship of Quarto and Folio', SB 3 (1950–51), 140. Moreover, of the ten ' Aiax. ' speech-prefixes in F which he cites (its normal form being ' Aia. '), eight are B's, and all eight occur in the first of the pages in which he encountered this charac- ter (¶3). This evidence from Tro . combines with the limited evidence of Tit . and Rom . and with the more numerous speech-prefixes in 1H4 and the Comedies to suggest that throughout the Folio B's full forms generally and predictably derive from his copy. Such evidence may be of use when the identity of B's setting copy is more problematic than in these seven plays. IV If ever a genealogical problem needed sorting out, it is that of the relationship between the Quarto (1600) and Folio texts of Shakespeare's 2 Henry IV . In his Lyell Lectures of 1959, Fredson Bowers remarked that 'at present, Hamlet and 2 Henry IV appear to be very seriously snarled in controversy', 28 28. Bibliography and Textual Criticism , Lyell Lectures, Trinity Term, 1959 (Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1964), p. 171. thus summing up two decades of work on the latter by four prominent scholars. Although M. A. Shaaber, Alice Walker, J. Dover Wilson, and W. W. Greg had been able to agree that the Folio restored eight passages (presumably cuts) omitted from Q cor- rected and otherwise altered many of Q's stage-directions and speech-prefixes, removed its profanity and colloquial or vulgar language, added its own mis- lineations to two in Q, contained numerous differences of other kinds, and must have derived from a manuscript of a 'literary' character, they had not been able to agree whether F was typeset directly from that manuscript or from an example of Q annotated by reference to it and containing both its variant readings and possibly some initiated by the annotator. In a long appendix to his Variorum edition, Shaaber had supported, not infrequently with negative evidence, the position taken by the Cambridge edi- tors (1864) that F's source was a 'thoroughly overhauled' transcript of Shake- speare's manuscript: he had argued, among other things, that the 32 supposed errors shared by Q and F (and rejected by at least a majority of editors) could be reduced to three either because they were defensible, lacked an agreed-on editorial emendation, had a precedent elsewhere in F, or could have derived independently from a common source. Walker, however, had put forward the contrary view first in an article and a note, and then more fully in her book on quarto copy for the Folio; in her usual positive and persuasive manner, she had cited eight shared errors in wording and other 'common errors' in punctuation and word forms, including 'maner', as evidence that F was set directly from an annotated copy of Q. The responses to Walker's essays had been swift but differ- ent. Wilson, who in his 1946 New Shakespeare edition had followed Shaaber, in 1952 had added at the end of his discussion of the textual problems two sentences that suggested he had accepted Walker's conclusions (as set out in her article) and would thoroughly revise for 'a second edition'; he cited three passages for which notes had already been revised. Shaaber had reacted almost immediately, employing the strategies seen in his Variorum edition to neutralize Walker's case but adding some new observations. 29 29. Matthias A.

Shaaber had concluded his appendix by registering his impression that 'no convincing similarities' of spelling, punctuation, and typographical style could be found showing that F descended from Q; in his article he discussed numerous but unsifted instances of spelling and capitalization drawn from the first three acts that defied analysis because he was unprepared to distinguish the insignificant from the possibly significant evidence. Wilson's revisions survived, without further notice of Walker's 1953 book, at least through the 1965 re- printing. The summaries, or abstractions, here and in the succeeding paragraphs conceal much complex and sometimes subtle analysis and argument. For another summary, see Thomas L. Berger, ed., The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, 1600 , Malone Society Reprints (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1990), pp. xiv–xvi. Quotations of Q are by reference to this admirable edi- tion, though those in the tables that follow, like those from F, have been copied from electronic files generously shared by the Oxford Text Archive and corrected against the copies in Trinity College, Cambridge. Almost simultaneously, however, Greg had recorded a mixed response: he had credited Shaaber's Variorum analysis of F's so-called 'massed entries' and other features with showing that they could not have been drawn directly from the prompt-book, and had found his case for F's direct dependence on manuscript persuasive, but had been impressed by the common verbal errors (which he thought likely to number more than Walker's eight), the shared nonsense, Walker's odd 'maner' spelling, and the instances of mislining, all of which inclined him to believe that F was typeset from annotated Q. 'And so the dispute continues without any certain conclusion in sight', Greg wrote somewhat prophetically, not having seen Shaaber's article, published the same year. 30 30. W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), pp. 262–276. About the common errors Greg wrote: 'critics can usu- ally be found to defend any nonsense and see in it proof of the subtlety of the author's thought' (p. 270). By the end of the 1950s, then, discussion of 2H4 in the traditional terms of textual criticism had ended in a virtual stand-off, with the main lines of differ- ence regarding Folio copy defined, the proponents clearly identified, and with Greg and Shaaber agreeing independently that more study was needed, either of the kind seen in Philip Williams' analysis of Q and F Troilus and Cressida (Greg, p. 272) or of'the working methods of compositors' (Shaaber, 'The Folio Text', p. 144). In the editions that have followed and in other scholarship, whether in support of these editions or independent of them, there has been much careful analysis of the problem as defined by Shaaber, Walker, and Greg, but (with one exception) no significant new evidence brought forward. Shaaber's view of Folio copy has prevailed, though in various permutations. A. R. Humphreys' 1966 New Arden Edition set the pattern in its thorough review of the 'exasperatingly ambiguous' evidence and its general conclusion. Running a variation on Bowers' 1953 suggestion that F's copy was a transcript of an annotated Q, 31 31.

Emery, Univ. of Miami Publications in English and American Literature (Coral Gables, Fla.: Univ. of Miami Press, 1953), p. 26. Bow- ers' hypothesis specified that the example of Q in question had been annotated by comparison with the original but worn-out prompt-book and had then replaced it; the transcript was made for Jaggard's men in order to preserve the company's current prompt-book. Humphreys hypothesized a scribal manuscript combining 'con- currently' Q and an independent transcript 'showing some cognizance of stage practice'—this despite his recognition that such a theory required 'mediation' (transmission) of typographical details through both transcription and composi- tors and despite his decision to prefer 'about eighty' of F's variants to Q's. 32 32.

David Bevington, revising Hardin Craig's Complete Works , tentatively approved the New Arden's manuscript and Bowers' transcript as likely scenarios, without mentioning annotated quarto, and G. Blakemore Evans, textual editor of the Riverside Shakespeare, summarized the dispute and seemed to defer to the New Arden's position. 33 33.

In an overview of the play's textual condition, George Walton Williams found no credible bibliographical links between Q and F, suggested F's setting copy was the 'fair copy of the foul-papers made ca. 1598' which Walker believed had been used to annotate Q, and proposed that it was 'a companion piece to the manuscript from which the 1 Henry IV quarto was printed', both of them made 'to prove to Oldcastle's angry posterity' that his name had been removed from the play. 34 34. 'The Text of 2 Henry IV: Facts and Problems', Shakespeare Studies 9 (1976), 173–182, esp. p. 179. Williams (p. 182, n. 34), unlike other scholars since Greg, confronts Walker's 'maner', a potential 'bibliographical link' which he dismisses on two grounds: (1) F's form may have also been used to justify its line (an argument that, in turn, must be dismissed); (2) the spelling represents the norm in Q1 1H4 (a telling point if his theory is correct that the manuscript behind that print and F were by the same hand). J. K. Walton's The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare (Dublin: Dublin Univ. Press, 1971) in its polemical preoccupation with method, its reliance on statistics of substantive errors, and its attacks on Walker's position as well as Bowers', nonetheless seems to follow the consensus in its view that F 2H4 was set from manuscript, in its view that there is 'little resemblance in accidentals' between Q and F (p. 202), and in its citation of 'dowlny' / 'dowlne' as anomalous spellings but studied ignorance of Walker's 'maner' (pp. 206–207). Peter Davison, uncomfortable with the New Arden's adoption of 80 Folio readings, with another 100 being of equal merit to Q's, and with F's 'excision, wholly or in part, of some twenty-five Quarto stage directions that are superior to those remaining in the Folio', produced his Penguin edition on the theory that F's copy was 'a transcript … made with the aid of actors' parts, despite the trouble and expense' but 'with the Quarto at hand, an excellent guide to the order of speeches'. 35 35.

More recently, manuscript as Folio setting copy has remained the preferred scenario, but its precise character and the role of the quarto (if any) in creating it has continued to generate multiple hypotheses. Eleanor Prosser, in a book-length study now most valued for its observations on the compression F's text underwent in its first quire (g) and the expansion in its second ( χ gg), thought that the manu- script conflated with Q was not a transcript but Shakespeare's own foul-papers. 36 36. Prosser, pp. 14–18. The long-anticipated Oxford Edition, though most notable for its view that six of the eight passages that F supplies and Q wants represent Shakespeare's revisions, ruled out annotated Q, partly on the basis of new statistical evidence, speci- fied a scribal copy of the prompt-book, but stipulated consultation of Q by the scribe. 37 37.

The Oxford editors (primarily Jowett and Taylor) accept that Q was typeset from 'author's papers' but argue that these included a separate manuscript leaf containing Shakespeare's addition of III.i (which the compositor temporarily overlooked) and that similar historical material found only in F represents his still later additions, rather than the cuts so long charged to Simmes's book. The 'cavalier' scribe of the Folio manuscript was responsible for most of the remarkable features of F's text, some of them (e.g., excision of profanity and introduction of act divisions) in accord with general theatrical practice early in the seventeenth century. Post-publication buttressing of these posi- tions elaborated some arguments and supported the rejection of annotated Q with comparative statistics for frequency of round brackets, exclamations, and hyphens throughout F, but without analysis of context and particular circumstances (Taylor, Shakespeare Reshaped , pp. 245–247), which by implication must have been effectively uniform. On the other hand, the editors note that most of the QF common errors they identify occur between TLN 1843 (Riverside III.ii.313; Oxford III.ii.308) and 2119 (IV.ii.19; IV.i.245) and conjecture that the scribe must have been influenced to choose Q's readings here (rather than those of his MS copy) either because F had additional passages or because change of manuscript leaves caused him trouble. Whether or not this solution is satisfactory, such desirable division of the problem and particular analysis has been, regrettably, wanting in some past work, where the temptation to treat the play simply as a whole has not always been successfully resisted. The New Cambridge Edition rejected many of the Oxford's arguments, propounded its own theories regarding an ur-Henry IV play, the pre-publication manuscripts, and the various agents involved in the transmission of their texts, but ended up agreeing that for Folio copy the idea of an 'intermediate transcript by an interfering scribe' was 'more plausible' than annotated Q, prompt-book, or a 'transcript put together from actors' parts'. 38 38.

Press, 1989), pp. 189–202; 'The Role of Jealousy: Restoring the Q Reading of 2 Henry IV , Induction, 16', Shakespeare Quarterly 34 (1983), 327–330; 'Sir John Umfrevile in Henry IV , Part 2, I.i.169–79', REAL 2 (1984), 199–210; 'Reconstructing the Ur- Henry IV', Essays in Honour of Kristian Smidt , ed. L. Hartveit, P. Bilton, S.Johansson (Oslo: PPP, 1986), pp. 59–78. Disposed to follow Prosser's assessments at many points, and regarding F as having 'no real authority', this edition focuses on the muddles in Q. It explains the eight Folio passages missing there as having been in the foul-papers which eventually provided Simmes's copy, where they were marked with deletions (sometimes unclearly) by a reviser 'acting upon the players' instructions, with a view to preparing the copy for the book-keeper in charge of getting the prompt-book ready'. Doubling figured in this 'revision' of the Q manuscript, which also included 'one or two pages or leaves left over from the earlier version of the Henry play' that Shakespeare inserted from his original ur-Henry IV manuscript in order to save buying paper, though he did so only when the printing of Q was at an advanced stage, and after the 'reviser' had completed his job. This speculated process is meant to help explain the many odd and inconsistent speech-prefixes in Q and why the many deletions and splices made in the foul-papers were often misinterpreted by the reviser, the scribe for F's manuscript copy, and presumably the Q compositor. Finally, the Oxford Shakespeare's one-volume edition has also rejected the Oxford Edition's analysis of F's eight unique passages, reverted to the traditional position that they were 'integral' to the play 'from the beginning', revived Shaaber's argument (via Prosser) that marking Q would have been 'a near impossible task', and concluded that Q and 'a post-1606 expurgated prompt-book' were 'collated in' a private literary tran- script that later became printer's copy for F. 39 39. Rene Weis, ed., Henry IV, Part 2 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), pp. 89, 97–99. In this account the 1606 date explains the purged profanity, but the playbook nonetheless retained the politically sensitive passages. Despite his disagreements with the Oxford editors (Jowett and Taylor) regarding the play's textual history, Weis's text ultimately resembles the Oxford Edition's more than any other predecessor's. Compositor B's speech-prefixes may shed some light on the central question of Folio copy for this play. In his pages there are well over 50 forms that should be useful for identifying his setting copy. On the whole, his long speech-prefixes in these pages, which generally conflict with his tendency to set abbreviated forms, indicate that certain Quarto forms—and a significant number of them— somehow found their way into F. But the value and precise implications of the evidence can only be properly assessed against the background of B's handling of speech-prefixes throughout the Folio, especially in 1 Henry IV , and more narrowly through analysis of the context in which the particular forms occur. As to the larger background, B's pages of 1H4 on the whole confirm that in the Histories (as in the Comedies and Tragedies) his long speech-prefixes, and especially his full forms, should generally reflect the variable forms of his copy. There is every reason to expect that such practices should have continued in B's next play, 2 Henry IV , which was begun on sig. f6 v —the forme-mate to f1, the last page of 1H4 to be put into type—and which occupies the next two quires. At those points in 2H4 where speech-prefixes attributable to his copy appear in B's pages, almost all find precedents in the Quarto. This evidence is naturally of various weights, as the earlier review of B's work throughout F would suggest. But here its value is especially affected by the compression and expansion which characterize the pages of this play in particu- lar and which Hinman referred to generally as 'page justification'. Hinman has shown that 2 Henry IV was unusually subject to such page justification because the Histories were printed out of order, beginning with all of King John and most of Richard II before the Comedies had been completed, then jumping ahead to Henry V and most of the Henry VI plays, and then returning to 1H4 and 2H4 be- fore the remainder of the Histories (the end of 3 Henry VI, Richard III , and Henry VIII ) were set. Since H5 had begun on sig. h1, the end of R2 and all of 1H4 and of 2H4 were to be packed into four quires (d–g), and this obviously was found to be impossible as the printing proceeded. The adjustment of type matter to alloted pages became critical during the composition of 2H4 , and consequently the compositors were under special pressure, as copy was cast off quire by quire, to fit text to the assigned pages, first by crowding as much of it into quire g as possible, and then (after the decision was made to create an eight-leaf quire to accommodate the rest of 2H4 ) to see to it that enough text was left to make x gg7 v a proper part-page. As the more experienced of the two typesetters, apparently, much of the responsibility for this adjustment fell to Compositor B, who set up not only the entire second half of the last quire ( x gg5–8 v )—where the play was to be made to end part way through x gg7 v , and then eked out with an epilogue ( x gg8) and a list of actors ( x gg8 v )—but also x gg1, which he composed as forme-mate to his x gg8 v before copy for the rest of the quire was cast off. Following on Hinman's general suggestions regarding 'page justification' and his more specific analysis of the production of quires g and x gg, Eleanor Prosser has attempted to reconstruct precisely the circumstances and sequence of events that led Jaggard first to compress and then to expand text in the two quires that almost wholly comprise 2H4 . In the process, she has indicted B for liber- ally altering the wording of the play in order to perform his master's bidding. Although these attempts are not entirely successful and the arguments regard- ing B's treatment of wording particularly shaky, there can be little doubt about the general validity of her observation that the compositors, especially B, were under extraordinary pressures to adjust the length of lines and thus of pages for this play. 40 40. In the best of situations, such events could not be reconstructed in any detail; here the question is complicated by Prosser's inferences about the actions of the scribe supposed to have interfered in the text of the manuscript she believes lies behind F (as well as Q). Compositor J/A's apparent compression of sigs. χ gg2 v –4 (which she ignores) raises doubt about the time scheme she conjectures, and her views on B's alteration of wording contradict what we can conclude about his work on much surer grounds. On this last, see Paul Werstine, 'Compositor B of the Shakespeare First Folio', Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography 2 (1978), 241–263, and his review of Prosser's book in Modern Philology 81 (1984), 419–422. See also Taylor, Shakespeare Reshaped , pp. 66–69. In the first quire, most of B's pages (sigs. g1–3) exhibit some compression, though the first two he set up (forme-mates 3 v and 4) appear relatively normal. 41 41. Column b of sig. g4 may perhaps exhibit some liberal spacing around the heading and opening stage-direction of II.iii; it is here, too, that the first major addition to the Quarto text occurred in B's work. But the evidence of compression or expansion in this page is very slim compared to other pages in this quire and those in the next. In the second quire, however, sigs. χ gg1 and χ gg5–7 betray signs of expansion, which ceases in sig. χ gg7 v , the part-page that, once reached, signalled success in filling the eight-leaf quire. How strong was the pressure to adjust lineation and vertical spacing to fit the text of the play into the allotted pages remains debatable. But mechanical matters, such as the length of speech-prefixes and the placement and spacing of stage-directions, would have been especially subject to these pressures, when they affected the number of lines of actual text that would occupy a column or page. These factors must certainly be considered in an assessment of the quality of B's speech-prefixes as evidence of the nature of his setting copy for 2 Henry IV . In about 40 cases B's full speech-prefixes indicate that his copy for 2 Henry IV must have had forms identical to those in Q. Some of the best evidence is in quire g (see table 1). In sigs. g3 v and g4, B's initial pages of the quire, it would appear that B's work was generally less affected by considerations of linear spac- ing than elsewhere in the play, and there are proportionately more full forms here than in the other pages of this quire. 42 42. Since B set these pages before g1–3—they were in fact his first ones in the play except for f6 v , where he encountered only Rumour, Lord Bardolph, the Porter, and Northumberland— he might be expected to have reproduced more full forms while he became acquainted with the characters, in accord with his general practice; however, this theory is not especially compel- ling once it is recognized that he would have been familiar with many of the characters from having just set 1H4 . His general preference for ' Prin. ' B abandons six times for the full form, which Q has uniformly throughout II.ii. A few of these forms may be affected by justification of the lines in which they occur (TLN 873NL most likely, and perhaps 852L and 888L). The others, however, seem clearly to have been set independently of such concerns (800L, 879, 898L). The Table 1.

' in sig. g3 v (847L) recalls B's practice in 1H4 . 43 43. See the end of section II above and Appendix, Note B, for discussion of the ' Pointz. ' at 1H4 , 214. As there, B's odd form might reflect annotation; the opening stage-direction for this scene (790) containing an earlier instance of this form would have been either heavily an- notated or entirely rewritten. There is, however, a ' Pointz ' in the dialogue in this scene (818) just above a deleted oath—as well as in J/A's work, at 2430—and so the form could reflect either B's own preference or an annotator's. Even these possibilities do not really affect the value of this full and peculiar speech-prefix as evidence of the relationship between F and Q with its own unique form. But what is most intriguing about this speech-prefix is that this single instance of B abandoning his standard ' Poi(y)n. ' occurs where Q fails to have the ' Poy(i)nes ' speech-prefix otherwise found throughout this scene. The parallels with 1H4 are striking and tend to confirm the view that B's ' Pointz. ' in 2H4 reflects the peculiar state of his Quarto copy at this point, in much the same way that it did earlier. As might be predicted, there are fewer long speech-prefixes in the remaining pages of quire g, which were subjected to the crowding already discussed. Yet if B in fact was trying to compress the text while setting sigs. g1–3, then the two full speech-prefixes that do occur in these pages (those at 616 and 622) are very good evidence of his copy's influence on the forms he set. Both are contrary not only to B's general preference for shorter forms, but to his specific aims in these pages. In particular B's ' Snare. ' is an unmistakable instance of a copy-derived form. The earlier ' Hostesse. ' may exhibit not only the additional influence of Q's catchword on the previous page, but also of the full name in the immediately preceding stage-direction, though (as already shown) stage-directions rarely ex- erted so strong a force on B as to make him depart from his usual inclination for shorter forms in the absence of some other inducement. Although predictably not numerous, the full speech-prefixes in these compressed pages are valuable evidence of the presence of Q's forms behind F. Compared to this quire, the next one, where B was generally under pressure to lengthen his type pages, should contain more long speech-prefixes, and they should be more suspect as reliable evidence of the influence of his copy. Such forms are indeed more frequent in quire χ gg (see table 2). Five of these full forms (TLN 1693L, 2799L, 2809L, 2832L, 3254L) may be put down to B's expansionist policy in this quire, and four others are perhaps suspect on similar grounds (2712, Table 2.

Considerations more or less aesthetic (akin to what we might now call typographical layout) could have influenced B to use longer forms in these lines, which begin oddly lined speeches that may reflect attempts at page extension. Yet what was actually achieved by the use of such forms is far from clear. But the other full forms in these pages would appear to be reliable evidence of the influence of his copy, rather than of page justification, on B's work. The speech-prefixes ' Feeble. ' and ' Prince. ' (1685, 1687, 1700; 2671, 2930NL, and perhaps 2757) are especially valuable, because they contain more than four letters, and such forms are among the surest signs of his copy's influence on B. The latter particularly recalls B's retention of this form from Q5 copy in 1H4 , although a four-letter name, ' Iohn. ' also constitutes reliable evidence the six times it occurs. As already shown, B rarely uses such forms unless copy has them. More specifically, in V.iv of 1H4 B usually follows Q5's variable speech-prefixes for Prince John, reproducing exactly its single ' P.Ioh. ' on f5 and its two ' Iohn. ' forms on f5 v , though characteristically shortening one ' Iohn. ' to ' Ioh. ', probably as a result of the need to justify a line (2973L). In repeatedly setting the full name of ' Dauy. ' in V.i of 2H4 , B uses the form found in Q throughout this scene. These eight complete names in χ gg5 v cannot be easily explained away as the result of either line or page justification. 45 45. Half of these speech-prefixes are in short lines, none in long lines that just barely flow over to create a second type line. The testimony of 4 is clouded but cannot be dismissed out of hand: 2 (2809L, 2832L) begin prose speeches that occupy several lines, though it is not clear that they were altered to full forms to justify the lines; 2 others (2804, 2826) begin oddly lined speeches, though it is not clear that the full forms served any decisive purpose. Even if we cau- tiously discount these 4 (as is done above), the other 4 remain, and it is noteworthy that Prosser does not cite any of them in her analysis of expansion in these pages, though she discusses lines 2804 and 2826 as instances of prose lines divided so as to create extra type lines under the guise of faux verse (p. 97). ' Dauie. ' (2795), B's first instance of the full speech-prefix, may reflect the additional influence of the preceding annotated stage-direction in its -ie spelling (as might the immediately preceding word in the dialogue). B also reproduces this form in V.iii, despite the fact that he there reverts to his usual tendency to shorten speech-prefixes, setting both ' Da. ' and ' Dau. '. 46 46. Some of these shorter forms may have been affected by line justification, but 2 (3086, 3101NL) definitely are not; nor is the ' Dauy. ' in this page (3070). In view of his performance in the plays set from known quartos, most of these must be at- tributed to the influence of copy. The speech-prefixes for this character, as well as those for Feeble and the princes, in quire χ gg look very much like copy-derived forms. Of all the speech-prefixes in Folio 2H4 perhaps the least reliable as evidence for quarto copy are the seven for the King, which invariably occur in B's pages in the form ' King. ', as they do throughout Q. It is possible, as Howard-Hill at one point suggests, that B had 'settled' on the full form of this title after quire b of Richard II . But it is equally possible, as Howard-Hill also seems to recognize, that B's inclination was to the ' Kin. ' form and that the complete form exhibits the influence of his copy's persistent ' King. ' on his work. 47 47. Howard-Hill, 'Compositors B and E', p. 46. In the Histories, the shorter form appears 7 times on sig. i5 ( H5 ) and on sig. p6 ( 3H6 ), besides its single appearance in 1H4 (see below). Henry V , it will be recalled, preceded both 1H4 and 2H4 . Clearly this is the case in LLL , where he followed Q's uniform ' King. ' on his first page, began to shorten to ' Kin. ' on his next, and thereafter alternated between this preference and Q's form. It may be inferred that his adoption of the full form midway through R2 is similarly traceable to his copy: both Q3 (printed by Simmes and probably set by his compositor A) and Q5 (the other print believed by some to have provided Folio copy) have ' King. ' throughout. In 1H4 Q5's virtually uniform ' King. ' would have reinforced such influence, but the presence of one ' Kin. ' (2709) more than half way through B's work on this play suggests that he retained his preference (however weakened by repeated exposure to ' King. ') for the shorter form. There is no clear evidence in the Histories of an actual preference for the full form, but only of its domination of his pages, which presumably reflects its persistence in his copy. Acquiescence (in this case) is not the same thing as preference. Table 3. B's long speech-prefixes (Folio quires g and χ gg) Quire TLN Folio Quarto Riverside Act.Sc.Line g1 v 332 Ch.Iust.

One could argue, of course, that such forms could have been present in the left margin of a manuscript serving as Folio copy (or provid- ing the basis for such copy), where its scribe, unlike a Folio compositor, would have been under no pressure to fit them within a narrow column along with the opening line of each speech. But a possibility, or at best a probability of some indeterminate degree, is not a certainty. Q's invariable full form is an observable fact and offers a credible explanation of the forms in B's pages that is consistent with other evidence. Other traces of the forms of Q's speech-prefixes may be found in Folio 2 Henry IV . Although longer forms occur throughout, the significant ones would be in the pages where B was not pressed to expand the matter (sigs. g3 v , g4, χ gg7 v ) and especially in g1–3, where he was actually trying to compress (see table 3). Perhaps the single most interesting speech-prefix in the whole play is the ' Shall. ' on B's last page (sig. χ gg7 v ) in a one-line speech that nearly fills the measure (3298NL). This is the only such form in B's work. Otherwise, he set ' Shal. ' (the norm) or ' Shallow. ' (under special circumstances). 48 48. See below, under table 4. The length of this crowded line would have encouraged B to use his customary shorter form. His unique ' Shall. ' duplicates that in Q, which is, moreover, the only instance of this form that B would have found there. 49 49. There are 4 others, in the pages of the second issue of Q, but these would have been encountered not by B, but by J/A, if at all. (Opinion favors the first issue, not the second, as lying behind F—i.e., as having been used for the manuscript that provided copy for it—but the conclusion rests on uncertain grounds.) The coincidence is too much to sequester be- hind the skirts of Fortune: F's unique ' Shall. ' reproduces Q's equally odd usage. Some other long, but not full, speech-prefixes in these pages may also indi- cate F's dependence on Q. The frequency of ' Falst. ' in B's g3 would suggest that J/A—who on the evidence of 1H4 favored this and other longer forms—rather than B, typeset the page. But this suggestion carries no weight once it is seen that Q also has ' Falst. ' here and could well have influenced B to vary from his pronounced preference for ' Fal. ', as exhibited in 1H4 and in B's first page of 2H4 (g3 v ). 50 50. B's pages of 1H4 have only 7 (1NL+6L) ' Falst. ' forms, as against 19+2NL+45L exam- ples of ' Fal. ', B's clear favorite. He carried this preference over into 2H4 : g3 v has only the short form, instead of the 7 ' Falst. ' and 3 ' Falstaffe ' in Q. There is no credible evidence that a need to compress induced B to select the short form in g3 v against a contrary inclination, whereas such pressure was clearly in force in g3, where B nonetheless set the longer form found in Q more often than his preferred ' Fal. ', and mostly in lines where justification was not evidently a factor. Cumulatively, these 11 are the longer forms of greatest weight, but those in χ gg7 must largely be discounted because of the general expansion happening there, even though they might not have occurred with such frequency without inducement from copy. 51 51. Cf. the four longer forms clustered in column a of sig. f2 of 1H4 , which seem to rep- resent a temporary departure from habit, perhaps associated with expansion in this page, as do the ' Prince. ' forms there (see section III and note 24 above). On the other hand, the single most interesting ' Falst. ' is that in the catchword on g3, because earlier B had set the actual speech-prefix ' Fal. ' at the top of g3 v (739) in accord with his settled preference. 52 52. Aesthetics, it might be argued, could have induced B to aim at filling the direction line with as much letter as possible, but elsewhere he did not shrink from three-letter catchwords and set ' Tra. ', for instance, on the first page of the play. Nor does this seem to be the effect of sort shortage, namely of the italic st ligature in a play that made unusual demands on it (cf. ' Host.', 'Iust.', 'Hast. '). Exhaustion of the sort, or sorts (there were two, one with the long s , the other with the short, apparently mixed in the same box), would have led B to use his favored ' Fal. ', as would any tendency to conserve the sort against future demands; if anything, then, these forms testify to the strong influence copy exerted in the face of contrary forces. Likewise, the many instances of ' Ch.Iust. ' in these pages, which occur despite B's inclination to set the shorter and simpler ' Iust. ', are misleading at first blush (and therefore not listed here). Some of them would have occurred in response to annotations in Q. But the most significant longer form for this character—the first ' Ch.Iust. ' in the play (332), which is the last B set—was apparently induced by Q's rare complete name (' Iustice ') in combination with the preceding stage- direction (see Appendix, Note C). 53 53. A similar case is B's only ' Beatr. ' in Ado for the ' Beatrice. ' of Q, also set by Simmes's A at almost the same time (see section III above and Appendix, Note A). Apparently in response to other annotations, B also departed from his preferences when he set ' Officer. ' (3186) once and ' Glou. ' twice (2906, 2912) towards the end of the play, despite his use of shorter forms earlier; all three of these occur where Q's speech-prefixes would have been altered by an annotator. Although more complex than others in 2H4 , these longer speech-prefixes reflect the state of the forms that B would have found in an annotated copy of Q. These longer forms, therefore, provide some support for the view that Q was B's basic copy for 2H4 , but apart from ' Shall. ', and perhaps his odd ' Ch.Iust. ', the best evidence remains the full forms in his pages. This is so despite the presence of some anomalous ones, which prove to be not altogether surprising given his practices in the Comedies and in 1H4 . In 2H4 B set a total of 13 full-name speech-prefixes where Q has a shorter form, four together on sig. g3, the remainder in quire χ gg (see table 4). The four anomalous speech-prefixes on g3, all ' Hostesse. ' instead of ' Host. ', occur in one sequence. On Table 4.

In the latter half of quire χ gg, these three full forms reappear, along with a ' Warwicke. ' (Q: ' War. ') and two instances of ' Pistol. ' (Q: ' Pist. '). Of the nine in quire χ gg, all but two seem to be traceable directly to the policy of expansion which B was following in these pages and which Prosser has explored at some length. 54 54. See Prosser, pp. 92–108. She notes particularly the ' Falstaffe. ' forms as products of this strategy. But on these same pages, each of the ' Shallow. ' forms allowed B to overrun the matter into an extra line, as did the second ' Pistol. ' and the ' War- wicke. ' on χ gg5 v . 55 55. See Prosser, pp. 95, 101 on some of these. The ' Shallow. ' on χ gg5 v (2824L) appears in any case to be a product of justification. Hence, only the earlier ' Pistol. ' (3216) and a ' Hostesse. ' (3171L) in this quire appear to be genuinely anomalous, and both may well reflect B's gen- eral expansionist tendencies in this part of the play. The latter, however, is like the earlier examples of this full form in that it might be related to the preceding stage-direction. Indeed, this and the three other aberrant speech-prefixes on page χ gg7 are all immediately adjacent to changes found in the Folio's text. The first ' Pistol. ' (3216) precedes the deletion of a single word presumably struck to censor oaths, but beside the other three are stage-directions that had undergone major alteration and would have been heavily marked up and potentially distracting had B's copy been an annotated Q. 56 56. As argued above, stage-directions were usually not sufficient of themselves to cause such aberration, but here major annotation potentially complicates the picture. Systematic study of the compositors' performance where other annotations would have occurred is needed before annotated quarto can be dismissed or confirmed confidently. Both of these apparently anomalous full speech-prefixes (3216, 3171L) could turn around to be evidence not against but for annotated quarto. In contrast, the four ' Hostesse. ' speech-prefixes on g3, early in II.i, cannot be attributed to such general pressures on B, since if anything he was compressing in this page. Yet the brief sequence, which ends with her long speech beginning at 635, is comparable to the cluster of ' Prince. ' forms on sig. f2 of 1H4 , where B was called upon to stand in for J/A. On g3 B seems to have been temporarily influenced, not by considerations of space, but by the three full forms that he found in the opening stage-direction (615) at the bottom of Q's sig. C1, in the catchword there, and in the first speech-prefix of the scene (616) at the top of its C1 v , which he reproduced. 57 57. Again, there would have been annotation around the second of these speech-prefixes (621). In short, if we except the seven complete forms in quire x gg that are almost certainly traceable directly to B's efforts to expand his copy, the remaining aberrant instances parallel almost exactly those in B's pages of 1H4 , even if we ignore the markings that would have been present in an an- notated copy of Q. There can be little doubt that by and large the longer and full speech-prefixes in B's pages of 2H4 exhibit the influence of Q's forms. Or, to put it differently, a significant number of B's speech-prefixes in this Folio play are remnants of those set in Valentine Simmes's shop, presumably by his compositor A, some twenty years earlier. As such they may be regarded as the kind of direct bibliographical links between F and Q that Williams sought, unless a scribal manuscript that preserved Q's forms intervened between the two books. The purpose of this theory of intervening manuscript, which posits a docu- ment incorporating not only the major Folio 'additions' that could not be written upon the leaves of a copy of Q, but also all the other variants drawn from the prompt-book (or other theatrical manuscript) as well as the Quarto's words and forms, would be to account for those readings unique to F that a critic or an edi- tor wished to reject as not deriving directly from the theatrical manuscript (or from the Folio compositors). To the extent that Q's speech-prefixes have been transmitted to F in a manner similar to that observed in the seven control texts typeset from identified quartos, this theory faces a serious impediment. For their survival through an intervening manuscript would have to be credited to the slavish accuracy of its scribe, who cannot then readily be blamed for changes in the actual wording (as opposed to forms) that it was his business to reproduce, and whose reputation as an 'interfering', 'cavalier', and 'overhauling' workman would therefore require considerable rehabilitation. As genetic evidence of the dependence of F upon Q, the speech-prefixes of Compositor B in 2 Henry IV may, then, be taken to bear considerable weight in attempts to sort out the question of the precise printer's copy for the Folio typesetting, as well as the more important one of its text's derivation from that of Q. One Shallow , however, does not make a summer, and Taylor's statistics for round brackets, hyphens, and exclamations remain to be reckoned with, not least because they lack contextual analysis. On the other hand, should evidence similar to B's speech-prefixes (say, his spellings and typographical styling) con- firm the implications of these 'appurtenances', the case for annotated Quarto as Folio copy would rest on a less ambiguous and more substantial basis than can be provided by the substantive readings and anomalous features so long cited and debated. APPENDIX Note A . Up to the last third of column b, I3 is dominated by ' Beat. ', which is also the prevailing form of Q. B's initial ' Bea. ' (32L) possibly reflects the pressures of justification, and the next two (62L, 75L) probably do so. However, toward the bottom of the second column, B substituted two ' Bea. ' forms for Q's ' Beat. ', both in short lines (87, 89). From there on this was his preferred form, which he set three more times, once in I5b and twice in K4. In these two pages, however, he departed from his preference twice, once to set ' Beat. ' (in I5b) and once ' Beatr. ' (in K4); each of these forms (553L, 1779) rep- resents the first type B set on the page, and each betrays the influence of Q's form (' Beat.', 'Beatrice. '). In the first instance, not only copy but a break in B's work on the play may have induced his temporary reversion to Q's ' Beat. '. Between the time he composed I3 and resumed Ado with I5b, he had set four pages of The Comedy of Errors (I1 v , I2, I1, I2 v ), and at least one and one-half days had passed while three formes of I—set by B, C, and D—went through the press. This in- terruption apparently combined with the influence of Q's ' Beat. ' to prompt B to reproduce that form upon resuming work on Ado . But when he next set the name a few lines later (559L), the preference he had finally developed while composing I3 reasserted itself. When he proceeded directly to set up K4, it was Q's full form ' Beatrice. ' that presumably occasioned B's only ' Beatr. ', which was followed by two substitutions of ' Bea. ' for copy's ' Beat. '. Note B . At the end of sig. d6, B set ' Pointz. ' where Q5 (wrongly) had ' Poines. ' (214L) and then repeated that substitution in the catch-word five lines later. What caused B to adopt this unusual form at first blush is not altogether clear, but the change probably had something to do with the presumably editorial excision of Q5's ' Enter Poines ' a line before his misassigned speech and the correlated ad- dition of ' and Pointz ' to the opening stage-direction of the scene (I.ii) earlier on the page (114). Of course the Folio, misled by Q5, mistakes the action here. The speech assigned to Poins actually continues from Falstaff's previous statement af- ter he and Hal have seen Poins enter; F compounds the problem by having Poins on stage from the beginning of I.ii. The speech-prefix, the deleted stage-direc- tion, and the expanded stage-direction are thus all of a piece of misapprehension and annotation, presumably editorial. On his next page, d6 v , B tried to fix on a standard form, but the variability of Q5's prefixes thwarted his attempt. He began by reproducing Q5's ' Poines. ' (the same speech-prefix that he had altered to ' Pointz. ' for the catch-word of d6). Q5's next speech-prefix for the character took the same form, which B reduced to ' Poin. '. This proved to be the form he eventually settled on, but when Q5 shifted to ' Poy. ' in the next two instances B followed suit (230L, 241), and when Q5 then printed ' Poin. ' (252L) B set ' Poyn. ', apparently in the recognition that he was dealing with a single character and in an attempt to reconcile Q5's various forms. B's copy then returned to ' Poy. ', which B retained, and then Q5 printed the innovative ' Po. ' three times in succession, which B first set as ' Poy. ', then as ' Poyn. ', and finally as ' Poin. ' in a reversion to his originally preferred form. Yet Q5's return to ' Poy. ' for the character's next speech led B to set ' Poyn. ' in the last instance of the speech-prefix on this page. Note C . The speech-prefixes for the Chief Justice are unusually complex because they can be properly understood only as the result of two independent series of actions by editor and compositor, often tending in opposite directions. Whoever prepared B's copy, whether scribe or annotator, had the advantage of being able to follow the dramatic sequence and would have been aware that the character identified as ' Lord. ' (or occasionally ' Lo. ') in II.i of Q was the same as that called ' Lord chiefe Iustice ' on his initial entrance in I.ii (328SD) and tagged throughout that scene as ' Iust. ' or ' Iustice'. In contrast, B first encountered this character in setting column a of g3 v , which contains the end of II.i and the beginning of II.ii. The speeches there were the last of a long series in this part of the play, many of which B was eventually to prefix with ' Iust. ', but only as he worked back through the scenes. About ten lines into sig. g3 v , B thus would have come upon annotated speech-prefixes which he set first as ' Ch.Iust. ', then as ' Ch.Iu. ', and then again as ' Ch.Iust. ' for the rest of the scene. Working back through his copy, he turned to setting g3, which begins with the last few lines of I.iii and then the opening of II.i. Here, towards the bottom of the first column, B came upon this character again. Although Q has the stage- direction ' Enter Lord chiefe iustice and his men. ' properly centered in a separate line, B crammed the laconic ' Enter Ch.Iustice. ' into a single line alongside half a line of dialogue, in the manner usually reserved for exits, and then set ' Iust. ' before his first speech in the next line, which nearly fills the measure (665, 666NL). Yet in spite of his efforts to compress matter elsewhere in the lines containing these speech-prefixes, he then reverted to the earlier ' Ch.Iust. ', setting it twice (669L, 683L), presumably in response to the annotator's marks for replacing Q's ' Lord'. He made one more effort to shorten this speech-prefix, setting ' Iust. ' three times in sequence, first where Q briefly varied to the shorter ' Lo. ' (710L, 717L) and then once where it resumed its full ' Lord ' (726L), before he reverted to a final ' Ch.Iust. ' near the bottom of g3 (730). Turning further back in his copy to set sig. g2, containing the middle of I.ii, B at last used speech-prefixes for this character that he favored both by general habit and in this particular situation requiring compression. The form ' Iust. ', which up to this point he had tried unsuccessfully to impose, dominates these pages of Q, and B set it repeatedly and almost uniformly, justifying one line with ' Iu. ' (418L). Finally, when finishing sig. g1 v , containing the beginning of this scene, B used the same form, which was again found in Q, with one important excep- tion: he set the long ' Ch.Iust. ' where Q has the unusually complete ' Iustice ' (332). This is the first speech-prefix for the character in the play, but B—in contrast apparently to Q's compositor, who was setting seriatim (Williams, p. 174)—would have had no uncertainty about the speaker's identity in this first instance on the page. The full name in the preceding, slightly annotated stage-direction may have exerted some influence here, but (as already shown) stage-directions were rarely sufficient, in the absence of some other inducement, to make B depart from his preference for shorter forms. This character of course reappears frequently at the end of the play, in B's ex- panded pages, which contain ' Ch.Iust. ' throughout, beginning on χ gg5 v , through all of χ gg6, and less frequently in χ gg7 and χ gg7 v (equivalent to a final page). But the speech-prefixes in these later pages are not informative. Able to follow the dramatic sequence, either an annotator or a scribe would have had the op- portunity to bring these later tags into conformity with the earlier. Whether or not these forms mirror those in B's copy, they certainly were compatible with his policy of expansion in these pages, and by the time he reached χ gg7 and χ gg7 v , the form was so well established as to override all other alternatives. In sum, the annotated forms of Q would have led B to use longer forms than he would ordinarily have done, even when he was otherwise compressing mat- ter. But when setting from that portion of Q containing speech-prefixes for this character that would not have required annotation, he followed his usual prac- tices, right down to setting a longer form where Q had one of its rare complete forms. In a scribal manuscript these variations in B's copy would, presumably, not have been at play. Note D . Tabulated below are Compositor B's speech-prefixes in the seven Folio plays set from known quarto copy. The forms set by B appear in the first column, those of the respective quartos in the second. All speech-prefixes for a given character are listed together. The list follows the order in which B encountered the characters when setting the plays and then, within the listing for a character, the order in which the various combinations of quarto-Folio forms first occurred as he worked. Not included in the table are B's speech-headings (that is, the full name centered above the first column of an opening page of a play or a scene). The symbols NL, L, and CW identify, respectively, forms in nearly long lines, long (full-measure) lines, and in catchwords. Much Ado about Nothing Folio Quarto Total Mess. Mess. 6 8L Mess.

Downs The hypothetical process known as memorial reconstruction was developed in the twentieth century by Sir Walter W. Greg and the "New Bibliogra- phers" to explain printed Renaissance playtexts identified as "bad quartos." Evi- dence cited to support the concept (if not the concept itself) has been questioned, principally by Paul Werstine and Laurie E. Maguire. 1 1. Paul Werstine, "Narratives About Printed Shakespeare Texts: 'Foul Papers' and 'Bad' Quartos," Shakespeare Quarterly 41 (1990): 65–86. Laurie E. Maguire, Shakespearean Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and Their Contexts (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996). Maguire's study of the New Bibliography and memorial reconstruction includes evaluations of forty-one Shake- spearean and non-Shakespearean playtexts. Arden Shakespeare editor Giorgio Melchiori replies that critics "intended to nullify all narratives by their predecessors. Theirs was not an alternative narrative…." 2 2. Georgio Melchiori, "The Continuing Importance of the New Bibliography," In Arden: Editing Shakespeare , ed. Richard Proudfoot (London: Thomson Learning, 2003) 19. However, Werstine and Maguire do specify other possible origins of these problematic publications relevant to the renewal in this essay of a hypothesis that New Bibliographers themselves discount. My analysis of the manuscript playtext John of Bordeaux , 3 3. Robert Greene, John of Bordeaux , Duke of Northumberland collection: MS. 507.

Harry R. Hoppe, " John of Bordeaux: A Bad Quarto that Never Reached Print," Studies in Honor of H. R. Fairchild. University of Missouri Studies 21 (1946): 119–132. indicates that it is transcribed from the stenographic recording of a stage perfor- mance. I compare this inference to prior scholarly opinion that the text is either a memorial reconstruction or a descendent transcription of authorized text and I discuss the implications of my findings. Before shorthand can be fairly argued as a cause of any playtext, a history of the current opinion devaluing that method of transmission must be reviewed, be- ginning with a clarification of the terminology. Early in Suspect Texts Maguire as- serts that "memorial reconstruction" is synonymous to "bad quarto" (15), and to "reporting" (18), apparently in agreement with Fredson Bowers, whose thirteenth and final listed class of Elizabethan printer's copy is "memorial reconstruction of the text without direct transcriptional link with any manuscript derived from author's autograph, in other words, the copy for a so-called 'bad quarto.'" 5 5. Fredson Bowers, On Editing Shakespeare (Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1966) 12. But earlier in the century Greg had carefully defined "reporting," listing six of its forms, including "shorthand reporting" and "memorial reconstruction." 6 6. W. W. Greg, Two Elizabethan Stage Abridgements (Oxford: Malone Society, 1923) 249–259. These and other terms may be redefined not only to adhere to their historical usages, but to maintain distinctions necessary to discussion. When in 1938 Leo Kirschbaum held that a bad quarto "cannot possibly rep- resent a written transcript of the author's text," 7 7. Leo Kirschbaum, "A Census of Bad Quartos," Review of English Studies 14, no. 53 (1938): 20. he referred to a physical set of fewer than fifty editions printed between 1591 and 1620 that have been suspected historically to be so corrupt that a significant part of each of these dramas re- sults from memorial transmission —a process recovering text without access to an original or descendent manuscript from which the agent's knowledge of the text derives, or to any other transcribed descendant. This term may be usefully ap- plied to oral, written, or printed text without quantification or identification of any method of transmission. A memorial report (or report ) is a relatively full text derived at least in part from any originating form of memorial transmission. Hypothetical cases of reporting that may result in bad quartos include "memorial reconstructions" and "theatri- cal reports," where a memorial reconstruction is the written report of a playtext, not taken from performance, but recalled by an actor or actors (or someone pos- sessed of a like knowledge of the text). A theatrical report is a text derived directly from stage performance, when the oral report is recorded and the performance is otherwise described. A shorthand report is a category of theatrical report com- prising stenographic notes, their longhand transcription and other descendants, including revisions, printed texts, and performances. 8 8. Kinds of theatrical report include longhand, as recently postulated by P. W. K. Stone, The Textual History of King Lear (London: Scolar Press, 1980) 13, and reports from memory by auditors. A stenographer is a memorial reporter only when he similarly augments a text from his own recollection; otherwise the actors are the agents of memorial transmission. Conceiv- ably, a report can itself be reported. Similarly, others of these terms are applied hypothetically by convention to particular bad quartos. To imply descent from a category or a subcategory, for example, the 1597 edition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has been called a "report" and a "memorial reconstruction." Maguire suggests that memorial reconstruction is conceptually flawed be- cause it is "capacious, being able to explain almost any textual problem" ( Texts 7). Werstine more accurately remarks that memorial reconstruction "by an actor or actors identified with specific parts has never proved an adequate explanation for the genesis of any 'bad' quarto; the case…has needed to be supplemented by secondary hypotheses" (82). When John Jowett responds to Maguire "that for some texts a capacious theory seems to be needed, and that few are available," 9 9. John Jowett, "After Oxford: Recent Developments in Textual Studies," The Shake- spearean International Yearbook , ed. W. R. Elton and John M. Mucciolo (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1999) 77. he apparently accepts the weakness of multiple hypotheses in order to retain memorial reconstruction as the best practicable explanation of some bad quartos. But the "alternative narrative" of a shorthand report, as suggested by Werstine in his criticism of the New Bibliography, has been "available" since Thomas Heywood's introduction to The Rape of Lucrece in 1608: … yet since some of my plaies haue (vnknown to me, and without any of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers handes, and therfore so corrupt and mangled, (copied onely by the eare) that I haue bene as vnable to know them, as ashamde to chalenge them. This therfore I was the willinger to furnish out in his natiue habit: first beeing by consent, next because the rest haue beene so wronged in beeing publisht in such sauadge and ragged ornaments. (sig. A2) Maguire's examination of memorial reconstruction conforms to her obser- vation that a "connection between suspect texts and shorthand reports has not been a component of studies … for many years, having been cogently disproved by G. I. Duthie in 1949" ( Texts 18). 10 10. George I. Duthie, Elizabethan Shorthand and the First Quarto of King Lear (Oxford: Blackwell, 1949). However, Adele Davidson ably questions the consensus, concluding in part that in "analyzing Elizabethan shorthand, Duthie tackled an abstruse subject, and students of Shakespeare have referred to Duthie's work without examining fully either Willis's system or Duthie's own methods and conclusions." 11 11. Adele Davidson, "Shakespeare and Stenography Reconsidered," Analytical and Enumer- ative Bibliography n.s. 6 (1992): 77–100 (p. 79). "Willis's system" refers to John Willis, Stenography (1602). See Adele Davidson, "'Some by Stenography'? Stationers, Shorthand, and the Early Shakespearean Quartos," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 90 (1996): 417–449; and " King Lear in an Age of Stenographical Reproduction or 'On Sitting Down to Copy King Lear Again,'" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 92 (1998): 297–324. Further criticism of his analysis is warranted, but Heywood's authority and the related capacity of a shorthand theory should first be addressed. According to Werstine, Heywood does not find it necessary to identify a particular actor or any other particular Individual …. Instead, Heywood's story … provides something different from the twen- tieth century's claustrophobic absorption with actors as the exclusive producers of texts that may have been put together from memory. (84) Heywood referred to this circumstance again in 1637 by publishing the pro- logue (but not the playtext) to a then-recent stage revival of his If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody , originally printed in 1605 (and probably one of Heywood's "mangled" subjects in 1608). He laments that his old play is: Writing 'bove one and twenty; but ill nurst, And yet receiv'd, as well perform'd at first, Grac't and frequented, for the cradle age, Did throng the Seates, the Boxes, and the Stage So much; that some by Stenography drew The plot: put it in print: (scarce one word trew) And in that lamenesse it hath limp't so long, The Author now to vindicate that wrong Hath tooke the paines, upright upon its feete To teache it walke, so please you sit, and see't. 12 12. Thomas Heywood, Pleasant Dialogues and Drammas (1637) R5 r . Except for those knowingly assisting a memorial report, no judge could be better placed than this prolific dramatist who twice condemns the transmission of his own work. Yet he is often cited to deny his assertion. For instance, after sug- gesting that Heywood's memory in 1637 was faulty, Maguire observes of G. N. Giordano-Orsini's conclusion that If You Know Not Me is a memorial reconstruc- tion that "Heywood was mistaken in his suggestion of shorthand, or, if shorthand were used, it was supplemented by other means. If Giordano-Orsini's conclusion is correct, it suggests that Heywood had no idea how his text had been con- structed …" ( Texts 103). 13 13. G. N. Giordano-Orsini, "Thomas Heywood's Play on The Troubles of Queen Elizabeth ," Library 4th ser. 14 (1933–34): 313–338. But for thirty years Heywood had a definite idea that his text was reproduced by stenography from a performance by players whose characterizations he must have known intimately. B. A. P. van Dam observes of a bad quarto derived from shorthand that its errors will be those "of the scribe who has copied the acting parts, the mistakes made by the actors … those of the stenographer, made in taking it down and afterwards when transcribing his notes into longhand, and … the mistakes of the printer also. It is a highly interesting question whether it is possible to distinguish these various mistakes." 14 14. B. A. P. van Dam, The Text of Shakespeare's Hamlet (London: 1924) 3. Many modern scholars have not thought this matter through. For example, Arden editor T. W. Craik suggests that "shorthand would not produce all these [invariable] characteristics" of bad quartos. 15 15. T. W. Craik, ed., King Henry V , by William Shakespeare (1600; New York: Routledge, 1995) 21. Yet nothing theoretically prevents a shorthand report from incorporating these features, ex- cept insistence that other agents, including actors, did not exhibit them. The only evidence of performance standards is the bad quarto itself, and then only if it is a theatrical report. Van Dam asserts that some actor-errors confirm theatrical reporting, while he acknowledges that few other kinds of error are peculiar to the stenographer. Shorthand reporting dependent on multiple agents inherently accommodates evidence that need not be explained by stenography alone. The hypothesis therefore enjoys some immunity to negative evidence that is fatal to theories of unitary origin. In other words, shorthand reporting is capacious. How was it discredited? The first pages of Duthie's Shorthand and Lear examine Timothy Bright's Char- acterie , first printed in 1588. 16 16. Timothy Bright, Characterie: An Arte of Shorte, swifte, and secrete writing by Character (1588). "Brachygraphy," Peter Bales's system in The Writing Schoolmaster (1590), derives from Bright, whose system was based on memorized lists of words. Their stenographs were altered by symbols signifying the first letters of synonyms. A phonetic system attempts to represent the sounds of words. Joseph Quincy Adams wrote in 1934 that "Wil- lis' system is entirely based on phonetics; Bright's system, on 'characters' that stood for individual words without respect to sound. Only Bright's system can explain the errors in the [1608 first quarto of King Lear ]." 17 17. J. Q. Adams, "The Quarto of King Lear and Shorthand," Modern Philology 31 (1933): 144. For Adams the Q1 errors are determined by what "Shakespeare wrote, according to the Folio" (149). This adheres to Greg's opinion that "where the [1623] folio differs from the quarto its readings … must be derived from the authoritative playhouse manuscript." 18 18. W. W. Greg, The Variants in the First Quarto of 'King Lear' A Bibliographical and Critical Inquiry (London: Bibliographical Society, 1940) 187. Greg had long held this opinion: cf. "The Function of Bibliography in Literary Criticism," Neophilologus 18 (1932–33): 241–262. Yet Adams's case for characterie was quickly confuted by Mad- eline Doran and by William Matthews. 19 19. Madeline Doran, "The Quarto of King Lear and Bright's Shorthand," Modern Philology 33 (1935): 139–157. William Matthews, "Shakespeare and the Reporters," Library 4th ser. 15 (1934–35): 481–498. Matthews expertly treated the topic earlier in "Shorthand and the Bad Shakespeare Quartos," Modern Language Review 27 (1932): 243–262. Doran notes that differences in the two early Lear texts were possibly caused by multiple-agent "alteration of unknown proportions; in that case argument in terms of mere quantity is of little value" (142). Nevertheless, Duthie adopts an argument similar to Adams's, though he means not to support shorthand, but to deny it by suggesting that errors in Q1 Lear , again determined by Folio variance, are unlikely to derive from Willis's system. This strategy dominates Duthie's argument, as one may infer from his title. When words variant in Q1 and F Lear begin with the same letter, Duthie accepts, strictly for the sake of argument, that the Q1 word could be a shorthand- caused error, which he accounts for in one of two ways. First, the reported word is assumed to have been on the stenographer's memorized list of common words and their representations: e.g. "m" = "mother", but was miswritten ("M") or mistranscribed ("moon"). Or he creates a phonetic stenograph to explain the er- ror. The "initial-letter" rationale borrows anti-Bright argument, but in every case (the symbolic or the phonetic) Duthie discovers alternative causes of the variants that reduce the probability of the shorthand errors actually having occurred. His discussion of line 3.2.58 (by Greg's line numbering) is typical. Assuming that a mix-up of "c" symbols caused the quarto error "centers" for the Folio reading "Continents", Duthie suggests instead that the "copy for Q may have had 'continents'. The compositor may have managed to deal only with the 'contin' and the final 's'. He may have read the 'o' as 'e', the 'i' as 'e', and the 'n' as 'r'…. Since 'centers' is a word he may have decided to be content …" ( Shorthand 67). This response to a supposed shorthand error "may have" no ra- tionale other than a determination to list alternatives. Stone offers a case for "cincture" to emend Q1 and questions "Continents" as a failed correction (196). Yet even such a plausible error is not exclusive to stenography; the variants are no more than suggestive. A second example of questionable analysis of possible shorthand error occurs at 2.2.151; variants Q1 "ont" and F "out". Duthie argues that if "a stenographer, intending to write [Duthie's stenographic "out"], made the great character too long at the foot and also straightened the foot out a little … he might be under- stood to be conveying 'ont'…. But 'ont' is a very likely misreading of a longhand 'out'" ( Shorthand 44). Supposition that a stenographer would be unable to write or read "out" in his notes seems artificial when all forms of error are likely to occur in bad quartos, regardless of their sources. As Davidson observes, the listing of alternatives does not logically disprove an explanation ("Stenography Reconsid- ered" 80), and Doran's objection to "mere quantity" also applies. Duthie did not disturb prevailing assumptions when he accepted that Q1 Lear can be judged by the F text, but modern opinion must reckon with later think- ing, as expressed by P. W. M. Blayney: "The differences between Q and F are not—most emphatically not—primary evidence for Q's origin. They show only what was done to Q at some unknown date after its publication. The only source of primary evidence for the origin of Q is Q itself." 20 20. Peter Blayney, The Texts of 'King Lear' and Their Origins. Vol. I. Nicholas Okes and the First Quarto (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982) 6. This statement invalidates Duthie's argument. For example, recent debate over Lear's possible revision from a Q1-like text to an F-like text by Shakespeare himself has seen many scholars commit to Blayney's hypothesis that Q1 derives from an authorial draft. 21 21. John Jowett observes that "Quarto King Lear used to be regarded as a superior example of a memorially contaminated text, but that view is not often heard today. Opposing it is the impressive authority of Peter Blayney's work …" ("After Oxford" 77). No prior argument establishes the authority of Q1 and Blayney has not yet published his case for Q1 printer's copy, which in my view remains open. Most nevertheless accept F as a revision and my own study leads me to agree with Blayney that the F Lear "adaptation was made by someone other than Shakespeare from the printed Q1 rather than from a playhouse manuscript of any kind" (Peter W. M. Blayney, letter to the author, 16 April 2009). Any- one holding Blayney's opinion must reject Duthie's acceptance of the 1608 text as a memorial reconstruction; they cannot have Q1 Lear printer's copy both ways. Although Q1 Lear is seldom categorized now as a bad quarto, Duthie be- lieved the printer's copy was a memorial reconstruction, and his Folio-based case against shorthand depends on it. His explanation for twenty variants is "certainly or probably, a memorial corruption"; for another fifty-six, "substitu- tion by the actor for the correct (F) reading" ( Shorthand 69). These kinds of error will occur in a report of performance. But for scholars—such as Maguire ( Texts 270)—contending both that Q1 is not a memorial report and that Duthie's argu- ment against Willis's system is sound, alternatives must be found for the variants consistent with their own conclusions. However, Duthie's argument resonated with the mid-century New Bib- liography: in 1955 Greg stated that "all speculation on [shorthand] has been scotched by Duthie's recent investigations and is not likely to be revived." 22 22. W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955) 380. Yet Greg had earlier supported shorthand as explaining Q1 King Lear , despite his claim to know "all the objections to the theory…." 23 23. W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1942) 95–96. Therefore, of his later acceptance of Duthie's case without published analysis, we may infer that Greg was influenced after all by the failed reconciliation of shorthand to the Lear Q1/F variants. Duthie's stenographs were developed to show how Willis's system could ac- count for Q1, but they lead to a contrary conclusion. In a review of Duthie, Matthews observes that in "many of the [variant] pairs, the [requisite] symbols are so different that the quarto forms could not possibly have arisen from a con- fused shorthand form." 24 24. William Matthews, review of Elizabethan Shorthand and the First Quarto of King Lear , by G. I. Duthie, Modern Language Review 46 (1951): 263–265. But Q1 was a candidate for shorthand only because it seemed to report the "authorized" text better than a reconstruction. For Q1 Lear to be a shorthand report of F, these irreconcilable variants must be F revisions or Q1 errors, some attributable to the players. Yet neither possibility was, a priori , admitted by the New Bibliography; 25 25. Duthie states, for example: "There is no basis for any theory of a Shakespearian revi- sion separating Q1 and F…." George Ian Duthie, "The Copy for King Lear , 1608 and 1623," King Lear , ed. George Ian Duthie and John Dover Wilson (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1960) 124. Kirschbaum suggests that shorthand theory "assumes that [actors] spoke their parts in Hamlet and Lear as we have these parts in the bad quartos…. These are … assumptions which the present writer, for one, cannot hold for a single moment." Leo Kirschbaum, "An Hypothesis Concerning the Origin of the Bad Quartos," PMLA 60 (1945): 697–715 (p. 700). the textual status quo welcomed both nul- lification of shorthand and acceptance of Q1 as a memorial reconstruction. But when recent opinion that Q1 does not report F reduces Duthie's title-argument to irrelevancies, his general objections to shorthand make an inadequate case. Duthie addresses one pertinent topic only in his separate analysis of Q1 Hamlet , where he repeats others' prior argument. 26 26. George I. Duthie, The 'Bad' Quarto of Hamlet (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1941) 12–26. Scholarship acknowledges shorthand piracy of sermons preached extemporaneously during the era of the bad quartos. Victimized clergy sometimes responded by authorizing minimally altered reprints, where little opportunity arises for comparison. However, in 1922 H. T. Price reprinted Henry Smith's A Fruitful Sermon in parallel texts (both from 1591) and in 1933 he analyzed two editions of a 1589 Stephen Egerton sermon. 27 27. H. T. Price, A Fruitfull Sermon by Henrie Smith (Halle: 1922). And "Another Shorthand Sermon," Essays and Studies in English and Comparative Literature: University of Michigan Publications in Language and Literature 10 (1933): 161–187. Price's case for Bright's system was dismantled by William Matthews and when Adams's argument for characterie reporting King Lear was confuted at the same time on the same grounds, the study of sermon reporting was abandoned with some issues yet to be resolved. Matthews addresses one of these: In 1590 and 1591 there were probably several nameless systems being practised. Until the appearance of Willis's word stenographie there were only two titles for shorthand, Bright's word characterie and Bales's brachygraphy . It is not unreasonable to assume that other writ- ers of shorthand … should have adopted one or the other of those titles for their own work…. ("Shorthand and Bad Quartos" 258) Alan Herr accepts this inference as "entirely reasonable," 28 28. Alan Herr, The Elizabethan Sermon: A Survey and a Bibliography (1940; rpt. New York: Octagon, 1969) 81. though it is also likely that the names were adopted by writers who were not shorthand practitio- ners, which may apply to opinion matching Heywood's in authority. Sir George Buc, nephew and chief assistant to Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney, and later himself Master of the Revels from 1610–22, assesses one of these terms: In this Cittie be taught the arts of Calligraphie , or faire writing of diuers handes, &amp; Char- acters, and of Ciphering, &amp; Algarisme , and (which is much to be regarded) the art of Brachy- graphie , which is newly discouered, or newly recouered, &amp; is of very good &amp; necessarie vse being well and honestly exercised: for by the meanes and helpe therof (they which know it) can readily take a Sermon, Oration, Play, or any long speech, as they are spoke[n], dictated, acted, &amp; vttered in the instant. 29 29. George Buc, The Third University of England , in John Stowe, Annales (1615) 984. Of this positive statement by one in a position to know, Maguire suggests that Buc "actually claims more for Brachygraphy than Bales ever did" ( Texts 99), though Buc probably meant the word to refer to shorthand systems generally—and expertly—in use. Although I agree to some extent with Herr that "accuracy of a shorthand transcript of an Elizabethan sermon is almost certainly incapable of verification" (82), my reading of many of these sermons leads me to conclude that the quality of reporting is quite high. For instance, the style of Henry Smith's remarkable oratory is consistent through piracies of long, involved scriptural themes. The fact that Smith augmented many sermons before his death persuades me that he accepted them as his own preaching, as demonstrated by A Fruitful Sermon: It may be while the Lord giueth, many will say: blessed be the name of the Lord; but when the Lord taketh away; who will say Blessed be the name of the Lord . [When the Lord did take, Iob sayd, Blessed be the name of the Lord .] There is one example then of Pavles doctrine, which is: in all things to giue thankes . (A2b) The second edition makes minor changes to this passage and restores the brack- eted line. A marginal reference "Iob. 1." is retained in the first edition, but reoccurrence of " Blessed be the name of the Lord ." probably caused a scribe's or a compositor's eyeskip omission of the reference to Job in the body of the text. Smith accepts the report to the extent that his restoration of an omission also restores the cause of the omission. But he does reject first-edition additions to the sermon: … nothing shoulde bee brought into the Church, or added [in matters of faith and doctrine] to our Religion, but that which is [agreeable and consonant to the] vndoubted truth [, and vtterly] without suspition of errour. It is not inough to be perswaded of our faith, but we must be assured of it: for [our] Religion is not built vppon [wauering and inconstant] doubtes, but vppon [most assured and certaine] knowledge. (C3b) Brackets in this instance indicate omissions in the second edition; their style identi- fies a revising hand whose first-printing augmentations (concentrated in the final pages) Smith cuts on sight. Apparently the preacher accepts the straightforward exhortation as his own. While the quality of these reports should be properly recognized, it is unnec- essary to argue their absolute accuracy. Matthews and Doran effectively elimi- nate characterie from consideration to force the inference that a different system was used to report the sermons, when "not in print," in a manuscript culture, cannot mean "nonexistent." Though phonetic, the system in use in 1590 was also probably not Willis's. Argument against specific features in Willis may not then apply to an al- ternative technique. For example, though Duthie aptly notes that "all short- hand should be cursive" ( Shorthand 29), as Willis's characters are not, another reporter could avoid this failing. Generalizations based on Willis's practice are to be trusted even less when they are inapt. For instance, Duthie attempts to show from Willis's prefatory use of the word treatably that the system was too slow for verbatim reporting. But the sense of that word depends on who does the treating. Speaking of both Elizabethan and modern stenographers, E. H. Butler observes that "the ability of the writer is the thing that tells, even more than the construction of the system." 30 30. E. H. Butler, The Story of British Shorthand (London: Pitman, 1951) 37. Nevertheless, Duthie envisions a reporter able only to "note down the gist of the speaker's argument, using the drastic methods of abbreviating clauses and sentences.… It might be used to summarize a speech briefly" ( Shorthand 24–25). These limitations do not account for the quality of sermons reported from 1589 on. Conversely, evidence may show features of another shorthand system that are consistent wi6th Willis's authority and experience. For instance, a stenographer may act on his dictum that "not the orthographie, but the sound is respected" (ch. 8, note a). We are left with Duthie's inadequate a priori arguments. For exam- ple, he remarks of Willis's advice to use special stenographs (e.g. "ao" = "also") that "The necessity for learning lists of words is a demerit in a shorthand system" ( Shorthand 36). But for the expert such lists aid speedy and exact writing. Not surprisingly, Matthews detects Duthie's inexperience, whose objections to Willis bespeak unfamiliarity with stenographic practice, e.g. the arguments that attached big and little characters might be confused, that memorizing the lists of arbitrary characters would be an onerous task, that small dots and strokes might be misplaced, that angles might become curves in rapid writing. Even tyros take such things in stride in present-day short- hands, and they should have given Elizabethan reporters no difficulty. (Review 264) Many Duthie assumptions may then be met with counter-assertion. For ex- ample, though he suggests that "In all probability the stenographer could not escape detection" ( Shorthand 75), Doran had suggested in 1935 that to "speculate on whether or not he would be detected in the theater, or allowed to continue if detected, is more or less useless, since we know so little about conditions in the playhouse and the attitude of the companies toward such practices" (154). Likewise, while Duthie asserts (mimicking Willis on the difficulties presented by a rapid speaker) that "a stenographer present at a performance would find his imagination transported beyond the endeavour of his hands" (25), Stone contends that "We should have in mind…the deliberate pace of a speaker addressing a large audience: actors…cannot speak more rapidly than the physical conditions allow" (35). The shorthand hypothesis must be decided on other issues. If bad quartos are bad and if memorial reconstruction is doubted as their cause, then evidence relevant to reconsideration of an older theory of their ori- gins should be welcome. John of Bordeaux has been studied by Laurie Maguire in Suspect Texts and separately in reply to Hoppe's essay. 31 31. Laurie E. Maguire, Suspect Texts (266–268 and passim); and "(Mis)diagnosing Memo- rial Reconstruction in 'John of Bordeaux,'" Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England 11 (1999): 114–128. Further analysis of the text as a potential bad quarto offers to shed new light on the genre. William L. Renwick transcribed the untitled play for the Malone Society, as- signed its name, and designated its scribe S, 32 32. William L. Renwick, John of Bordeaux (Oxford: Malone Society, 1936) vi-viii. who cannot have been the author of the legible but partially damaged manuscript. Maguire lists several reasons for scholarly interest in the text: it is slightly annotated by known but unidenti- fied theatrical hands; the name of the actor John Holland is added marginally as three entries; and a speech is added in the hand of playwright Henry Chettle. Additionally, "it appears to have been written to dictation" ("Misdiagnosing" 114). However, Maguire neither accepts Renwick's suggestion to that effect, nor does she agree with Hoppe that the play is a memorial reconstruction. Instead, she posits scribal transcription, with simultaneous revision, as the necessary ori- gins to explain the lone early copy of the play ("Misdiagnosing" 124–125). By Maguire's criteria, a bad quarto is a memorial reconstruction or it is neither; her "alternative narrative" can only be that corruption arose coincident with recourse to an authorial manuscript or its descendant. I will examine John of Bordeaux not only for evidence of transcription and memorial reconstruction, but also for shorthand reporting. The play is a sequel to Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay with no cause to doubt that Robert Greene is its original author. 33 33. For discussion of authorship see Waldo F. McNeir, "Robert Greene and John of Bor- deaux ," PMLA 64 (1949): 781–801. McNeir accepts Hoppe's case for memorial reconstruction without additional argument, as does Benvenuto Cellini, John of Bordeaux or the Second Part of Friar Bacon (Firenze: La Nuova Italia, 1952). Written in Italian, Cellini's valuable resource remains the only critical edition of the play. Because my investigation does not rely on the plot, the briefest synopsis may suffice: John of Bordeaux is a military commander opposing the Turks warring against the German emperor Frederick, whose son Ferdinand attempts to win John's wife Rossalin by causing her husband's exile. Prince Ferdinand is aided by the German magician Vandermast, whose ri- valry with Friar Bacon in the earlier play is renewed when Bacon takes the side of John and Rossalin. Throughout, Bacon's assistant Perce provides comic relief. The text of John of Bordeaux fills most of its folio pages and only occasionally limits line length to pentameter. Hoppe lists these facts as evidence of reporting. Maguire reasonably argues that verse displayed end-to-end is still verse, and she is surely correct to suggest the scribe's purpose was to save paper because, as Hoppe also notes, the last six pages are more normally lined. 34 34. The final two damaged, partial pages are omitted from my study. For conjectural amendments see Cellini (179–180) and McNeir, "Reconstructing the Conclusion of John of Bordeaux ," PMLA 66 (1951): 540–543. Yet Maguire mistakenly asserts that the manuscript "simply lines verse as prose" and she con- tends that "frequent coincidence of punctuation with metrical line ends suggests that the scribe had an ear for, or knew he was copying, verse. Three out of four metrical units are signaled by punctuation in the following quotation" ("Misdi- agnosing" 117). The unrelined passage reads, stay Astrow vnCevell scoller that abusest art and turnest thy skill to pre Ieduis the Iust, was magicke therfor ment to mayntayne wronge, to force Chast Ladies yeld to folish lust, ha vandermast 664 35 35. Line numbers and folio page numbers follow Renwick (without superscript), 1a-13b. "Punctuation" connotes frequency and variation, but in twenty-six crowded pages S uses only eight full stops (four on folio 1a) and 109 commas. This aver- ages one mark for every eleven lines, or fewer than five per page. Even at this low rate, the punctuation tends to be bunched: folio 6a has eight commas in ten lines, none in the other forty-seven. Folio 7b opens with the three commas in Maguire's citation but has only one in the next forty-five lines. Hoppe accurately describes the greater part of the text as written with "total disregard of verse-lining or punctuation" (123), which may well be a meaningful characteristic. For example, Greg defended his opinion that the first quarto of King Lear could have derived from shorthand, where the longhand transcription was "undivided metrically and practically unpointed." 36 36. W. W. Greg, " King Lear —Mislineation and Stenography," Library 4th ser. 17 (1936–37): 175. The notes would be unpunctuated in the interests of speed; the transcription would largely reproduce the notes. Though relatively few lines in John of Bordeaux are irreparable, editorial care would have been needed to put it in order for printing and "bad quarto" corruptions could have resulted, as where Bacon addresses the chained Vandermast: "so famed for magick and for excorsismes here let lose / yor selfe no willt not be way with him I saye" (1170–71). Maguire suggests that from "folio 11 onward there are few errors of lineation" ("Misdiagnosing" 117). Though later lines approach metrical length, many er- rors remain and end-to-end verse continues. For example, on 12a Bacon enters, saying The tyme is com and Bacon must be gone to morow in Iudgment sitts great fredricke to dome the sensur of a haples Dame and thincks to quit him of the Inglish frier, but I will show the 1123 The first isolated regular line is 1132. At 1153, Bacon instructs the devil Astrow (verse line divisions added): then hei the hence as swift as thought can fli / and fetch me hether Iaquies vandermast / yf anie other devell make resist / say Bacon chargd the with a nanggree froune / to bring the drunken Iermayne all in post / Rabsacke go thow in to the north seet op the Brass / [?] windoss of the winds bring me a hiddious storm vpon the yearth 1159 Despite a superficial regularity, the verse is mislined, beginning with the exten- sion "say Bacon charged". The last line can be considered regular only by ac- cepting the prior two as corrupt. Earlier on the same page, Bacon converses with Astrow, who replies: no Bacon no it goes not with the as twas wont the hellish sperrits ar no mor at thy commaund the tyme prefickst thy pour hath a nend and thow art ours both bodie and soull ho ho ho 1143 Is this Prose, corruption, or stannic verse? Similarly, at 1195 (folio 13b) Bacon has stricken Vandermast mad: grace I grace is a pretie wench I know her well com hether phelossopher whats hell tell me how manie drope of blud there is in the sea or thow diest non place tibe domene ther is no grace for me com awea to hell 1199 Consecutive verse lines of twelve, nine, nine, fifteen, and eleven syllables would not have been written by Robert Greene. If this is not corruption but prose, the printer would also probably have lined the passage as verse. Although so much error would probably not occur in circumstances other than memorial transmis- sion, the corrupt metrical line itself is more telling than simple mislineation. Consider these consecutive passages from 11b: Rossalin a chast and vertious Dame wif to Ser Iohn of Burdiox that brav knight som say for treson is condemd to die and with her Inglish Bacon worthi man of arte vnles with in one munth the chance to fynd a champian forth that will defend the case 1080 that wo is me for that good ladies sacke to thincke her vertious case thers non doth undertake Damo peace peace Correbus hould and say no more tis wisdom still to kep a hatch befor the dore let those thinges rest and let ous tend or shepe him counpt I wise that well his tung can kepe Corebus that wate I well and ther with all I know that good men offten greve at good mens woe Exent her Iohn of Burdiox speaks his specth 37 37.

In contrast, John's speech beginning at 1090 is error-free, punctuated (though not merely to mark line-ends), well-spelt, metrical, and properly lined. Written in Henry Chettle's hand, this addition probably mirrors the fair copy of John of Bordeaux initially delivered to the players who purchased it from Greene. But the rest of the play's divergences from metrical regularity are evidence of corruption from a variety of causes. For example, Maguire lists for John of Bordeaux "extra-metrical phrases (e.g. 115, 218, 225, 497–8, 598–9, 1045)" ( Texts 266). The list is incomplete, perhaps because Maguire believes that a "feature which can arise 'in almost any mode of transmission' should have no place in a diagnostic study of memory" ( Texts 185). But evidence should not be excluded without contextual analysis. Maguire dismisses the internal repetitions adduced by Hoppe as evidence of memorial transmission. For example, Hoppe suggests that Perce's "parroting of the previous speaker's closing words is … a reporter's repetition" (127). But the recurring trait is obviously a clown's affectation, as Maguire shows by compari- son with Friar Bacon ("Misdiagnosing" 120). Whether the clown speaks more than is set down for him—as Renwick suggests (viii)—is uncertain. Hoppe cites another sort of repetition that fails to support memorial recon- struction at line 774: "the prayes that vertue [waits] guids and pittie waights vpon". Maguire rightly objects that anticipation of "waits" involves a common error that occurs simply because the anticipated word intrudes on a scribe's mind from the nearby context. However, the well-known phenomenon of scribal eye- skip is caused by nearby identical (or similar) words and phrases: … set op the gats 459 [turks] and mad a sallie forth, and sett vpon the turks Hoppe correctly observes that "gates" was omitted and then added to line 459 to replace "turks". But he attributes the error to Kirschbaum's "mnemonic tele- scoping" by a reporter (128), which draws on the eyeskip concept without estab- lishing any analogous criteria. Hoppe discounts eyeskip by noting the prima facie improbability of dictation taken from copy read aloud that could be transcribed directly. But eyeskip will occur in transcribing shorthand into longhand. Hoppe also cites a number of quickly amended scribal errors, as when Ferdinand's line at 301 contains a repetition: she scornes the plee of pelfe and Iewells why she houlds [scornes] them all as trash and but here husband 301 A marginal correction such as "holds", despite Hoppe's suggestion (127), need not have been immediate. Still, the eyeskip repetition (of "scornes", caused by reoccurrence of "she") was easily seen and corrected. More significantly, eyeskip anticipation may cause omission that can escape notice. One of Hoppe's examples is the lament of the Turkish emperor Amurath: how can I live now [selimus] that my son is dead now selemus my onlie son is slayne 228 After writing "now", the scribe's eye falls on the second "now" and he writes "selimus". The omission resulting in "how can I live now Selemus my only son is slain" is avoided because S catches the error in time to make correction currente calamo . This kind of evidence indicates not only transcription from written copy, but transcription of a few words at a time, which is compatible with convert- ing shorthand notes into longhand. Frequent transcription errors are unlikely to occur in a manuscript dictated by reporters; the tedious exercise ("beyonnd the commane reatch") would probably have engendered more errors, but of dif- ferent kinds. Hoppe cites Greg ( Abridgements 320) on more distant anticipations as evidence of memorial transmission that "can only occur where the whole of the text and not merely the immediate context is present to the mind" (121). Maguire com- ments on a potentially meaningful anticipation: Curiously, Hoppe fails to mention the one really significant repetition that might indicate memorial reconstruction in John of Bordeaux . On folio 6r, the clown, Perce, commences a speech with a three-line question, which reappears twenty lines below. The first appear- ance is marked for deletion…. This indication cannot be used as evidence for several reasons. ("Misdiagnosing" 122) Maguire's "usable evidence" is two printed plays that "owe their textual dis- order to other causes," and two manuscripts, each with a distant repetition. She observes "that we have only one instance of anticipation in John of Bordeaux . Isolated examples of repetition are insufficient indication of memorial recon- struction." Yet Maguire does not explain why her citations are analogous to Perce's anticipation. For example, she suggests that the scribe of The Fatal Mar- riage "makes a number of bizarre errors, not least of which is his repetition of lines 1956–66 … at lines 2056–57 ( sic ); he realized his error while writing the second set of lines, and then broke off midsentence …" ("Misdiagnosing" 122). The repetition in The Fatal Marriage is not bizarre. 39 39. S. Brigid Younghughes and Harold Jenkins, eds., The Fatal Marriage (ca. 1620; Oxford: Malone Society, 1959). The scribe numbered a sheet at the top left of its fold to transcribe on four folio pages. On completing the first page he wrongly continued on the verso of the second leaf. Crossing out his error, he transcribed nearly identically on the verso of the first leaf. The era- sure (written earlier but appearing later than its correction) results from a known cause that cannot form part of an argument about Perce's anticipation, which must be evaluated on its own characteristics. To begin, Hoppe does mention the passage (131, example 3, where both line sets are quoted), though his treatment is inadequate: "It is almost impossible to suppose that a reader-dictator would commit such a haplography … on the other hand, a reporter-dictator's memory would be only too apt to skip and jump in this way …" (131). This fails to explain how the error occurred, or how it was corrected. Although the anticipation is nearly identical to the correctly placed lines, there is no other evidence of scribal error. Perce takes two "honggerie hosborge scollers" under his wing and offers to show them how to "geet meat with oute monie" (504–505): … ye shall se me furnish ye with meat and a figge for monie how pearce I promies the whe know not) perce) why is ther anie alle howse [so por that hath not a post and a pece of chalke or ani] all wif so vn [skillfull in Arethmetick that can not fuger vp forte pence] be wise 509 [and Ill tech yow to] gett meat with out monie can not you com in to an allhowse and seet yor cape a tone sid hufte tuftie and loke as bigg as though yow had a mynt in yor pocket and say osties what meat hast thow for ous After another twelve lines the first scholar asks: I marie perce but wen we have eaten this good how shall we do for monie to pay fort) perce) how shall we do for moni to pay fort faith 525 I thincke thy head was mad of an ould bagpipe that hath no wind but what is blown in to it nor thow no wit in thy head but whate must be put in to it why is ther ani all howse so pore that hath not a post and a pece of chalke or anie all wife so vnskillfull in Arethmetick that can not fuger vp fortepence Ill tell the my frend 530 as mani wrighting ar the bewtie of a scriveners shope so manie scores ar the glori of an allhowse) ij scoller) but how yf she will not trust vs) perce) but how yf she will not trust ous … The deleted lines (508ff) are more appropriate later, when the ale-house is com- pared to the scrivener's shop. The deletion is then correct, though part of line 507 and more of line 509 should also have been erased, when Perce's (modernized) continuation would have probably been: … ye shall see me furnish ye with meat and a fig for money. How Perce? I promise thee we know not) Perce) can not you come in to an ale-house and set your cap at one side, huftie tuftie … 508 If this is correct, we may infer that associating "can not you come in to an ale- house" with "is there any ale-house" led the actor to the wrong speech, when "be wise and I'll teach you to get meat without money" was his redundant, ad lib recovery. This significant repair would be unnecessary when dictating to a scribe, but in performance an actor must extemporize. A theatrical report ac- commodates the sequence; memorial reconstruction and transcription of autho- rized copy do not. This evidence of anticipation is admissible and singularly convincing of me- morial transmission. But Maguire argues further from a mistaken assumption: Hoppe did not consider the possibility that the manuscript could be a nonmemorial abridgement. In this case, we must assume the scribe to be following the complete text, abridging as he goes. As a result, we have the false start at 507–9, where he decides to omit Perce's 20 lines from 509 (moving straight to 529), but changes his mind. ("Misdi- agnosing" 125) There is no evidence that S changed his mind at 508–509. Reviser A (not S) deleted these lines, including a part of Perce's transition back to the correct se- quence. Renwick prints the revisers' additions in bold type but differentiates their strikeouts only rarely in discussion. Hoppe and Maguire mistakenly assume that S is responsible for substantive deletions. For example, at line 35, even though Renwick identifies the interlined "Jade" as reviser A's, Hoppe takes the deletion as evidence that S corrects an anticipated word: Iade he sett me on a [stead] that posted me in hast from Albion 35 Maguire discounts Hoppe's inference, though she does not note that the correc- tion was made by a reviser who probably was unaware of "steed" in the much later passage. On the same assumption, Hoppe analyzes a deletion at line 423: the "scribe inserted a speech for Vandermast … which was canceled, probably immediately after being written" (128). But the deletion is again a later revision. However, another instance may signify memorial repetition, as Hoppe sug- gests (126). At lines 308–309 Ferdinand asks of Vandermast to "let magick be amenes to get me grace of Lovlie Rossaline / and I will mak the partener of my wellth". The same request is exactly repeated more than 300 lines later (my verse-lining is indicated): ffer a vandermast thow flower of Iermani, / famous for cunning 646 favor me so much / to gett me grace of Lovlie Rossalin / and I will make the partener of my welth / I will what will I / vand tut tut my lord your othes ar Lovers othes / to sone fo r got / I &lt;t&gt;ak no promes to one othe you swere 650 Maguire suggests that the request at 647 is consistent with the author's charac- terization of Ferdinand, when "in his insincerity, he resorts to repetition" ("Mis- diagnosing" 121). Maguire relines the dialogue as if to restore the playwright's original, but she takes no account of the verse: Ferdinand's "I will what will I" is left short; adding a second short line ("tut tut my Lord" or "too soon forgot") is hypermetrical. 40 40. Cellini arbitrarily emends to "I will … what will I not? tut tut my Lord" (143). Intentional repetition does not account for this deficiency or the insensible reference to a forgotten oath in the text. A better explanation is that the players failed to follow their script. In the preceding lines, Vandermast interpolates a vocative and reassures Ferdinand: nay stay my gratious Lord even now my promis past shalbe pformd and Rossalin whos rigore wronged yo r hart shall by my arte inforced be to love 645 Vandermast had earlier (310ff) denied Ferdinand's request "to get me grace of Rossalin" as impossible; he now reminds the prince that he has not forgotten the one promise that he did subsequently make to help force her submission: Not so my Lord welle have another plot, where weallth Wines not a woman vnto love ther rather is a boundaunce [in] or contempt, 41 41. The reviser misunderstood the text to delete "in" and substitute "or" at line 315. but let that damsell be opprest with wante tuch her with ned and that will mak her shrincke …. 316 Vandermast's later reference to this promise at line 643 is probably meant for Ferdinand to confirm his reward for a scheme; but the actor mistakenly repeats earlier lines that no longer have any point. Aware of his error, he fails to recover and turns to his fellow actor for help, who wittily regains momentum by alerting the audience to the error, marking the irony that an oath was literally forgotten. Modernized, the lines become: Favor me so much to get me grace of Lovely Rosaline And I will make thee partner of my wealth … I will … what will I? Vand. tut tut, my Lord, Your oaths are lover's oaths too soon forgot I break no promise to one oath you swear; but sit you down And while you feed on spleen … 651 Renwick suggests "break" for "&lt;t&gt;ak" at line 650, but even on correction the awkward line appears to be a theatrical modification to fit the circumstance. If these suggestions are credited, the lines derive from performance. 42 42. Although Maguire asserts that "transposition is of no value in diagnosing memorial reconstruction" ( Texts 194), van Dam describes an instance analogous to Ferdinand's repetition and Vandermast's recovery in Q1 Hamlet (adduced by comparison with Q2) that confirms a report of theatrical origin: King . Leartes, content your selfe, be rulde by me, And you shall haue no let for your reuenge. Lear . My will, not all the world. 1790 King . Nay but Leartes, marke the plot I haue layde, 1791 Line 1790 lacks any logical connection with the context…. The player who acts the part of Laertes hears the last words of line 1789 'no let for your revenge', which remind him of the first half of [Q2 4.5.137]: ' King . Who shall stay you?' upon which he … answers with line 1790 … the second half of [4.5.137]. The actor personating the King of course notices the mistake, and by means of the words … 'Nay, but Leartes, marke …' very cleverly sets the dialogue right again. (19) Memorial reconstruction allows on-the-spot correction, but a theatrical report holds a mir- ror up to nature. Suggestion that Greene drew Ferdinand's character by these lines denies evidence of a sixteen-word repetition. Another Ferdinand repetition may be related to his character: "Daphni tut wer she but as coy as she …" (91); "ha vandermast Daphnie was ner so [q] coye …" (293). For Hoppe, it is "hardly conceivable that a competent Eliza- bethan dramatist would perpetrate … such repetitions" (126); Maguire holds that to "Ferdinand, love means 'the Daphne simile' as automatically as war to Hotspur means 'honour'" ("Misdiagnosing" 121). However, the evidence is con- sistent with an actor's imperfect performance, whose errors paradoxically take Ferdinand's character beyond the author's or the player's conception. We may then suggest that Greene was not responsible for all nuances discernable in the characters of the manuscript. This possibility will be convincing if a totality of ev- idence leads to the conclusion that John of Bordeaux accurately reports an inexact performance. Hoppe correctly argues that speech ascription confusions would have re- sulted in printed error (124). Maguire observes that S "regularly writes 'Ros- sacler' for 'Ferdinand' (this mistake also occurs in dialogue). At 697 the [speech prefix] 'fredrick' should be 'ferdinand'" ( Texts 267). Maguire does not address this evidence further, 43 43. Maguire inadvertently demonstrates the ease of confusion, where by "Rossacler, a Petrarchan lover …" she means "Ferdinand" ("Misdiagnosing" 116). but contrary to her assertion, the Ferdinand/Rossacler error does not occur in dialogue, though it is found in mid-line speech ascriptions (marked by S with brackets): "before [be falce] I falce my fayth vnto my lord) Rossacler my …" 275. Hoppe suggests without elaboration that the "best-reported" roles (those of Frederick, Rossacler, and Ferdinand) help to identify the actor-reporters, "which may explain why at certain points there is confusion in character-names" (132). Renwick implausibly suggests that the confusions result from cuts. A careful analysis of the evidence yields other inferences. The scribe's Frederick/Ferdinand mistake occurs once in dialogue and twice in marginal speech prefixes. The origin of this error in the similarity of names is indicated by reviser A's own added entry and correction at line 1011, "[ffred] ffer- dynand". There are, nevertheless, other anomalous headings. For example, on folio 2a, line 110, S has an entry for "Basshaws", and at 115 "Bassha" as a speech prefix. Renwick's "reviser B" adds a majuscule "B" to subsequent "Bassha(w)" prefixes (at 124 and 129) to differentiate a pasha who enters unannounced by the scribe. The letter "B" is also added to the speech prefix "souldier" at line 140, but not at line 142, though it is not clear how many speaking characters are on stage. On folio 3a the attendants to the Turkish emperor become "noble" and "lord" (twice, with late-added "B"s). I believe that all these confusions may result not from careless transcription or dictation, but from the necessities of speedy stenography. An instructive revision appears on folio 2b, where Bacon uses magic to extort from the Turkish Emperor his sword, robe, and crown, by conjuring a scene where the Turk's son Selimus is threatened: Turke … my curious robe and my semeter my I exchaung them for the western world and have the land that limits from the alpps vnto the farthest 180 setting of the son I would not leve my robe nor yet my croune, my semeter se Cristian how it shines sound full well thow likest it now it shalbe thine, hould him Sellimus Ill bucher vp the slave despight of all the quilities of art Enter Selimus a soulder persuing him &gt;imus help helpe oh helpe &gt;ke the voise doth show like littell Selimus ha it is he stay soulder stay thy hands stay and take rannsom whath what thy selfe willt aske 189 The marginal "sound" and "Sellimus" are directions added by a reviser, who would not have intended to assign to Selimus the threat to Bacon, though the heading could be confusing to a compositor. However, the lesson in this instance is that a reviser may identify characters from several manuscript sources, but a stenographer's identifications depend on the dialogue. In this sequence, the reporter would have learnt of the "soulder" at line 188. Only at line 219 is he identified, again in dialogue, as the devil "Astrough". The playwright would not have withheld this information for more than thirty lines. In other cases a stenographer will have a choice of names. For example, S refers to "John" or "Bordeaux" interchangeably. A similarly perceived scribal option may help to undo the confusion surrounding the speech prefix for "Ferdi- nand." The play opens, "Enter Emperor, Iohn of Burdiox his wif Rossalin his son Rossacler Vandermast frier Bacon with attendants". A stenographer unfamiliar with the play may account for the extant manuscript; his initial stage direc- tion will have been made up from his notes or from what he has independently learned of the play. When Ferdinand enters at line 71, the scribe knows that he is Frederick's son, but identifies him as "Rossaclere". The error may have seemed consistent with the list reproduced in the first stage direction if S mistook "Emperor" as antecedent to "his son Rossacler". However, the dialogue names Ferdinand at line 75, and his lines in the scene are all properly ascribed before his exit at line 103. Ferdinand enters at line 255 again as "rossaclere", which name remains the prefix throughout the scene—even when "Ferdinand" is finally identified by name at line 310. However, when "yong rossaclere" enters with Ferdinand at lines 408–09, neither character is misnamed again. Rossacler is identified in the dialogue at line 487, and he first speaks at line 491. While Ferdinand is silent until line 450, one must ask how a stenographer could have differentiated the names in the massed entry: Enter emperor and his son frier Bacon Iohn of Burdox son yong rossaclere and vandermast 409 Renwick suggests (perhaps by inference from excessive room in the paren- theses enclosing speech ascriptions) that speakers' names "may often have been added after the text was written" (xiii). When the scribe discovered whom the "yong" actor personated, he would then have retroactively differentiated the characters in stage directions and speech headings beginning with their entry at 409. This sequencing could hardly be authorial and normal transcription is obviously not to blame. A scribe creating his own headings and learning as he goes explains this crux. The stenographer, whose speech ascription was a speedy symbol indicating a change of speaker (represented by the scribe's ubiquitous right-hand parenthesis), would add names while transcribing, and he would re- duce the possibility of error by noting the context of the dialogue. 44 44. Duthie finds argument (against Q1 Lear as a shorthand report) in a text without "persistent imperfection at the beginnings of speeches (the stenographer having had to pause to identify and note down the name of the character speaking), nor after stage directions" ( Shorthand 75). But no pause was necessary for the putative expert who recorded what he heard and left additions for later. This practice accounts for the play's midline "headings." Further, the same symbol near the end of a transcribed line would signal a line-break to accom- modate an ascription in the left margin, as is especially indicated by numerous down-turnings: and now I may not suffer yow to staye therfor depart and yf Iohn o heavenes to you I lift my guiltles hands you lov yor life 617 The expedient is also indicated at line 167, where the Turkish emperor Amurath continues to speak after a parenthesis: 45 45. The emperor is transcribed as Ambrothe, Amewrothe, Amewroth, Amerothe, Ame- wrath, and Ameroth. A stenographer will not be consistent with unfamiliar names. The point may be insignificant, when S writes "Cheldern", "Cheldren", and "Children" (588–590), unless one questions transcription of authorial copy. … step callibasha and with thy sword reach me that provd presuming Cristians head then let him make compayre with Amewrothe) whats the matter 167 A pause in the Turk's speech occasioned the sign for a change of speaker. How- ever, the dialogue resolves the error, and the transcribed parenthesis is superflu- ous. The alternative possibility, that "Amewrothe)" was in the authorial copy-text, is denied by the fact that no other instance of a lone parenthesis appears in the text after a name. Yet a number of such marks occur when extended pauses are plausible. 46 46. Cf. lines 435, 578, and 1130. The inference is that the stenographer wrote first and asked ques- tions later. After rejecting evidence of erroneous memorial repetition by actors in John of Bordeaux , Maguire discounts the evidence Renwick and Hoppe cite for dicta- tion in "numerous examples of unusual, phonetic spellings," which, she suggests, "can be explained by a scribe 'sounding' words in his head" ("Misdiagnosing" 123). To accept this argument is not merely to concur that S was free to spell as he pleased—which was then true to some extent for all English-writers—but also to accept that a scribe's spelling flagrantly disregarded his copy-text. The inefficiency can be obvious in combination: stern ar his loks so lokt my husband earst his doune whight loks like to the Caster swanes 1016 [Stern are his looks; so look'd my husband erst. His down-white locks like to the Cayster swans] Had the play been printed, confusions such as the ambiguities of "loks" would have led to corruption. However, the phonetic spelling is generally read- able; "grattewlat", "meadesen", and "anenstrewment" are clear enough. For this reason, the common-sense assertion that no one would enlist so unlikely a scribe might be denied, despite the large number of truly strange spellings. The case is different for the Latin orthography; anyone familiar with its rules would have no need or desire to spell phonetically. An unlearned scribe would rely on his copy, not on the "sound" of written words he could not in any case pronounce. Renwick does assert that the scribe was uneducated (xii), and it is impossible to disagree. Still, an English-only penman could apply his skills to Latin in dictation, though the quality of his transcription would suffer without grammatical, syntactical, and semantic understanding. For example, Ferdinand's citation at lines 81–82 is erased by reviser A, perhaps in recognition of its cor- ruption: "… [o well sayd Ovid in his wanton] / [wright venus it vinis egnes et egna fuet]". Maguire must assume that the scribe read "Venus in uinis ignis in igne fuit" but "sounded" the words to himself before transcribing unacceptably. Lines copied so badly in normal circumstances would force subsequent transcrip- tion to proceed by one or two words at a time, at most. Yet even when evidence of currente calamo correction of short scribal errors suggests that S transcribed at a slow pace, the Latin passages in John of Bordeaux are spelled only by sound: … I mervell why empatien 108 phebus cried ha me he qod nullus amor est medecabeles erbes yet will I tri the art of vandermast Exent omnes [Ovid: hei mihi, quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis]. At folio 12a, the magician Bacon addresses a recalcitrant spirit: Enter Astrowgh and Rabsacke Quid petes Bacon Bacon Quid petes why stubbern hellhounds whats the case this rusti Iorne hangs vpon my narme why shakes not of theas Chaynes when as I charme heaven yearth and hell why quaks not all yor poures Astrow no Bacon no it goes not with the as twas wont 1140 the hellish sperrits ar no mor at thy commaund thy tyme prefickst thy pour hath a nend an thow art ours both bodie and soull ho ho ho Bacon away presuming speright away thow hast no pouer over a Cristian fayth willt thow do what I commaund the do) devell) no Bacon no Bacon no Seleno frater hecatis vnbrarum pater et trux erinis nube tenarivm nemvs flintisqui frodis horida mici teges it nox Cleno qui flctis manv negra et retortes luna pernox 1150 cornibus, ha desta … Renwick identifies "Seleno" as (possibly) Apollo, brother of Hecate-Silene; "eri- nis" as Erynnis; and "Cleno" as Celaeno (xiv); he then emends lines 1149–51: No?— Seleno frater Hecatis, umbrarum pater, et trux Erynnis nube Taenarium nemus flentesque (?) frondes (?) horrida mihi teges, et Nox, Celaeno qui flectis manu nigra et retortes lunam pernox cornibus, adeste. 1151 Of this "hopelessly corrupt" invocation of underworld spirits, Renwick suggests that a "scribe so ignorant of Latin as to be capable of these errors might be ex- pected to transcribe more carefully" (xiii). Cellini attests to the difficulty of the lines by taking "Seleno" to be Celaeno, but denies that identity to "Cleno" (170–171). 47 47. A convincing emendation showing both "Seleno" and "Cleno" to represent Celaeno would be phonetically telling, but I have come to agree that this passage is not likely to be corrected. The Latin of lines 1147–51 is reminiscent of the corrupt Italian in the bad quarto of another Robert Greene play, where the source in Ariosto corresponds well to Alleyn's Orlando manuscript player's part: 48 48. Ariosto and Orlando are cited from Greg ( Abridgements 222, 151–152). Ariosto O feminile ingegno, egli dicea, Come ti volgi e muti facilmente, Contrario oggetto proprio della fede! O infelice; o miser chi ti crede! … Importune, superbe, e dispettose, Prive d'amor, di fede, e di consiglio, Temerarie, crudeli inique, ingrate, Per pestilenzia eterna al mondo nate. Alleyn, 92–99. O feminile ingegno di tutti mali sede come ti vuolgi et muti facilmente Contrario oggetto propri[o] de la fede O infelice, o miser [] credi inportune, superbe, ett dispettose priue d amor di fede et di Consiglio temerarie, crudeli, inique, ingrate. per pestilenza eterna al mundo nate. Although the first line is revised, the transcription by the theatrical scribe is ac- curate in comparison to the quarto of 1594: Q Orlando , 732–739 O Femmenelle in genio de toute malle sede; Comete, vulge, mute, fachilmente, Contrario, zeto, propria de la fede; O infelice, miserate, crede, Importuna, superbia, dispetoze: Preua de more, de fede, de consilia, Timmorare, crudele, ineque, ingrate, Par pestelenze eternal monde nate. Questioning the assumption that Q copy was itself transcribed, Greg reacts to Orlando as Renwick does to the Latin in John of Bordeaux: Since the writer was obviously ignorant of Italian he might have been expected to take the obvious precaution of testing his recollection against the original and thus avoiding some at least of the absurdities he has produced. Is it not more likely that his version was phonetic because he had only his ear to guide him, and corrupt because he was unable to check his memory by the original? ( Abridgements 340–341) Anyone may prove by personal experience the necessity of transcribing for- eign words singly (or partially) to minimize error. Greg's inference of a phonetic transmission must be right, even though he envisioned memorial reconstruction instead of shorthand, and evidence in John of Bordeaux leads Renwick to the same conclusion. Further, Greg describes a ten-line Latin passage in Orlando (1275–84) comprising "a superficial layer of evident errors" above a "comparatively sound" text with "a few deep-seated errors, some evidently corruptions." He also infers "that the passage was first corrupted and then subjected to editorial correction" before printing ( Abridgements , 239). So might have been described the Latin of a printed John of Bordeaux . Renwick also observes the scribe's "persistent errors which point to a per- sonal idiosyncrasy: 'quoine', 'quill', and 'quoy'; and, still more, the voicing of initial 'p' to 'b' nine or ten times, of which seven were corrected currente calamo " (xii–xiii). Why does S confuse b and p ? By "voicing", Renwick seems to suggest that dictation is a more likely explanation of the failure to distinguish these let- ters than misreading or "head-sounding." The supralinear minuscule "b" would not often be confused with an infralinear "p." Although printing is not in the equation, the suggestion of substitution by "sounding" must take into account the immediacy of scribal transmission, which affords less time than typesetting for such mental errors to germinate. Though similarly voiced letters could be misheard in dictation, shorthand reporting allows another explanation. One symbol used for two like-sounding letters aids rapid writing. In the p/b case, the time used to decide upon which is correct would always be left to the context taking shape in the longhand transcription. In most instances where S miswrites these letters, at least momentary confusion is possible. On writing "an aged man porlie atiered in robes of penurie", "ropes" may have been the first word to come to mind (when "robes" might not be suggested by "poor attire"). Reading further, S will have seen by "penurie" that "p" must be overwritten by "b". This instance shows the error was not confined to the initial letter or to a mistaken "b", despite the predominance of those mistakes. At 796, "bade" would have been supposed before correction to "payd". Similarly, several confusions of "but" and "put" may be in part caused by temporary semantic ambiguity: … now this is Like to prove a tragedie I but on 216 … saing or Basshawes all were but to sword 238 … here I put in Plato and here / I but in haristotell… 389–390 In each case, "put" was required, yet "p" was written over "b" only at line 389; the mistake can stem from confusing "I put" with "aye, but." At line 347, "p" is written over "b" twice: marie he hath tought me thre princepalls and theas the be inprimes that a good felowes purse is like a poot of alle 347 Neither "burse" for "purse" nor "boot" for "pot" seems a likely semantic confu- sion, but each is consistent with phonetic transmission. Transcription from writ- ten copy cannot credibly account for these numerous cases. Using identical symbols for "k", "c", and "q" is also a stenographic likeli- hood. The scribe usually let stand his use of "qu" for initial "c"; but at line 293 S wrote "q" before erasing it and continuing "coye". S spelt effectively by sound with little to indicate the influence of a formal education. His habits in John of Bordeaux include other possibly vestigial indications of rapid writing. S interchanged the letters u and v somewhat in accord with a familiar system. When a word called for either letter initially, v was used. S followed this conven- tion with few exceptions: "vpon"; "velian"; "veri". When either letter was medial, u was the norm, as in Chettle's added lines: "couert"; "releeues"; "pouertie"; "thou"; "disguise". Medial u for v was not universal, yet most writers complied even though readers had to determine from context the letter intended. Despite the good sense of allowing each letter to stand for itself, those who did so were ahead of their time. S was among this group, though not because he had consid- ered the matter thoroughly. His medial u is occasionally "v", when the context is then necessary to know that "u" is meant. Reader familiarity will have been in judging the other way round: "Coniver" (conjure); "inivrius" (injurious). The reversals derive perhaps from the scribe's determination to write medial v as "v", a practice for which there are very few exceptions. For example, 11 a has "dis- cover"; "prove"; "beleve"; "resoulve"; and "hevines". If the scribe transcribed notes utilizing necessarily different stenographs for the sounds of u and v , the func- tionality of "v" for v in longhand would have been apparent. Such advancement will derive from practicalities for the self-taught stenographer, rather than from overcoming the inertia of an illogical custom. A phonetic speller has perhaps two advantages as a note-taker; he will not be tied to habits unrelated to representations of sound, and he will more quickly realize and learn shortcuts. The play has many spellings consistent with these possibilities. For example, the sounded but non-essential end-letter t is often missing: "waigh" = wait; "kep" = kept; "suplian" = suppliant; "temp" = tempt; and "spigh" = spight. Most of these words S spelt correctly elsewhere. A scribe working from good copy has no reason to omit a letter that belongs, when a stenographer will at times transcribe a word as he has recorded it. S indulged a common habit in separating an initial syllable from the rest of a word. But the extent of his usage indicates a time-saving utility: "in treted"; "in chaunt"; "in cappable"; "in senced"; "in swes". If a separate symbol were used for the word "in" (most likely a sign for the letter n ), the expert could more quickly move to other syllables. The same holds for "a" and "b": "a gaynst"; "a monste"; "be case"; "be wrayes". The manuscript word "be" is mistakenly used for "been", which could also be represented by the single letter. The scribe may have used a symbol for a quickly to represent the sound, and later to influ- ence the spelling of a phrase: "a nasse"; "a nanggree". The usage was extended to other initial elements: "my narme"; "thy nei"; "my nier". For each of these cases a letter or common word is used for which there could be a ready symbol, while leaving the "n" sound for the following syllable. Reduction of the number of symbols is desirable; but unambiguous use of one symbol for added purposes can only be helpful. The definite article will rate its own sign in such a system, but S misuses "the" for "thee", "then", and "they"; "thy" may have been represented by the same sign, as it is used in error for "thee". Similarly, "a" stands mistakenly for "as" and "at", and colloquially for "he". These words are suited to instant writing and contextually assisted transcription that on occasion will be imperfect. The majus- cule "I" is in one instance used mistakenly for "it"; in another telling instance, "I" is stricken and followed by "it". If each of these words was represented by a symbol for i , they would be differentiated by context. Such errors are not likely to occur in transcription of written copy or in dictation to longhand, when the rest of the text exhibits many spellings longer than necessary. The foregoing analyses lead to a number of conclusions. First, scribal errors indicate that the text of John of Bordeaux is a transcript that cannot result from dictation only. Second, phonetic orthography throughout the text (most nota- bly in Latin passages) nevertheless indicates a stage of oral transmission. Third, mislineation and metrical corruption argue against transcription of authorized or descendent copy. Fourth, distant anticipation and repetition (with following dialogue serving to recover from these errors) point to memorial transmission without the capability of retraction. Fifth, confusion of speech headings and character identifications in early scenes are explained by a reporter's unfamil- iarity with the text, but not by transcription of authorized copy. Sixth, sparse set directions, including mid-line speech headings, indicate a rapidity of writing inconsistent with transcription of authorized text. Seventh, scribal habits point to a phonetically based, highly idiosyncratic speed-writing. Taking the inferences together leads me to conclude that John of Bordeaux is the initial transcription of shorthand notes of a performance. Numerous anomalies in the playtext do not rise to the level of corroboration for a shorthand hypothesis, but this proposal does accommodate evidence that is difficult to fit to alternative theories. For instance, when Vandermast tries to coax his own wife (supposing she is Rossalin) to accept Ferdinand's advances, the addition at 688 of "young and"—anticipating line 690—disturbs both the meter and the balance of the argument. The mistake, very easy in performance, is probably not scribal: … knew you the plesuers of a princes love / you wold not thus despies younge ferdenand / is he not young and son vnto an emperor / and what wold wemen mor then young and rich … 690 Recognition of the likely source of the manuscript also calls into question the assumptions and rationalizations characterizing prior scholarly opinion. For example, Renwick asserts that the manuscript "was made for a company already familiar with the play" (viii). However, there is no way to know whom S ad- dresses at 447 by "Exent Bacon to bringe in the showes as you knowe". Renwick assumes an awareness in the recipient players, but a reminder of the placement of a dumb show may have been addressed to an intermediary (Chettle?). The evidence suggests that reviser A was not familiar with the play, whose corrections are often misguided: … for Rossalin her husband [] excild for Rossalin you begg and suffer blame, yet Rossalin will trivmph in her harmes … The reviser interlined "and" to replace the blotted word before "exiled", but the sense and meter suggest "For Rossalin her husband is exiled." Ultimately, many features of the text, if inessential to the case for shorthand reporting, are invaluable to our understanding of the theater as evidence of a play captured in its performance and in its purloining. Maguire ends "by examining the alternative explanations for the manu- script … which show that New Bibliographical eagerness for memorial recon- struction conceals potentially more interesting and more important scenarios for the history of Elizabethan theater" ("Misdiagnosing" 115). Her own alter- native—that the play is transcribed from authorized copy—is argued on the mistaken assumption of scribal correction and an assertion that the scribe spelled phonetically by repeatedly sounding the words of his copy to himself. I maintain instead, for the convergent reasons listed above, that the much "more interesting and important scenario"—and the reality—is a shorthand report. The essential proposition is an astounding mental and physical activity of two hours' duration. Achieved (and preserved) once, we may presume it was accomplished before and after by the same practitioner and probably by others systematically adept and motivated. "Suspect texts" inevitably come to mind. For example, in one of the notices taken of John of Bordeaux , Sidney Thomas cites the speech added at line 1090 in his argument that Henry Chettle contributed to a bad quarto: Even more striking is the fact that, sometime between 1590 and 1594, he had been em- ployed to supply a missing speech in the play manuscript, John of Bordeaux …. The parallel with Q1 Romeo and Juliet becomes even more striking if we accept Professor Renwick's opinion that John of Bordeaux is a corrupt and possibly surreptitious manuscript. 49 49. Sidney Thomas, "Henry Chettle and the First Quarto of Romeo and Juliet ," Review of English Studies n.s. 1, no. 1 (1950): 8–16 (p. 12). Addressing the same Romeo and Juliet quarto, John Jowett remarks: The corrupt text is usually supposed to have been put together by an actor or actors. An alternative or additional possibility is that Chettle and Danter resorted here—and perhaps also for the other infamous Danter bad quarto, Orlando Furioso —to the reporter who, according to the title-page, took 'by characterie' a sermon preached by Henry Smith and published by Hoskins, Chettle, and Danter in 1591. 50 50. John Jowett, "Notes on Henry Chettle (Concluded)," Review of English Studies n.s. 45, no. 180 (1994): 517–522 (p. 518). The last-mentioned publication is the same Fruitful Sermon discussed earlier that exhibits literary additions written or approved by the printer and author Henry Chettle. 51 51. The colophon of A Fruitful Sermon identifies Chettle as one of the publishers. The first edition of The Affinitie of the Faithful was "Printed by William Hoskins and Henrie Chettle, for Nicholas Ling , and Iohn Busbie . 1591". Another edition printed for Ling and Busbie (without mention of Chettle) is also dated 1591, but with this title-page addition: "Nowe the second time Imprinted, corrected, and augmented, according to the Coppie by Characterie, as he preached it." Thomas and Jowett approach the hypothesis that texts related by common features and publishers are theatrical reports. New study is required of the player's part and the printed text of Orlando Furioso —and of all other bad quartos, including Q1 Romeo and Juliet . But the hypothesis is supported by the text of John of Bordeaux , which is explained by the accurate verse, the close pho- netic rendering, and the recording of on-stage errors, as a remarkably well done stenographic report. These observations deny the historical intuitions that early English short- hand was unworkable and that Renaissance dramatic performances were ideal reproductions of authorial works. They also suggest that persons such as Henry Chettle were employers—and self-employed—in the innovative acquisition of plays for the use of rival companies and for publication. Acceptance of John of Bordeaux as the record of a performance as it occurred—just as sermons were recorded live, and not as literature—is an inference that (multiplied by large numbers of corrupt texts) has profound implications for the study of Renaissance Theater, and especially of bad quartos. However, performances closely adhering to authored dialogue are not pre- cluded by the existence of bad quartos. Rather, extended effort is necessary to determine whether texts not so categorized are good performances well reported. As shown by revisions and corrections begun on John of Bordeaux , successive transcriptions and printing of reports will more or less carefully remove evidence of memorial transmission and stenography. Playtexts may survive in forms not easily betraying extraordinary histories. Because John of Bordeaux suggests that bad quartos originated from shorthand, textual scholarship should be alert to evidence of reporting that survives in other texts. Theatrical reporting may ac- count for a wide range of printed plays, but memorial reconstruction should be recognized as a viable explanation for only a few special cases. THE BAGFORD CHAPEL RULES: A SET OF ENGLISH PRINTING HOUSE REGULATIONS, CIRCA 1686–1707 by Alan D. Boehm It is generally believed that only three sets of English printing house regulations—"chapel rules"—have come down to us from the period be- fore 1800. One set, the rules of the Bowyer firm, was written in a ledger book in the late 1750s by the younger William Bowyer and one or two of his workmen. This set appears to be incomplete, for it includes no rules addressing the work of pressmen. A second and obviously complete set of rules survives from Samuel Richardson's printing house. These are preserved in a broadsheet bearing a let- terpress date of August 30, 1734, and the signatures of 20 journeyman printers Richardson employed at the time. A third group of chapel rules appears in Joseph Moxon's Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing of 1683 and 1684. Unlike Bowyer's and Richardson's regulations, these rules did not originate in a specific printing house. Moxon merely offered them as examples of rules "usually and generally accepted" among late seventeenth-century printers. 1 1. Bowyer's rules are preserved in the British Library of Political and Economic Science, MS Collection G.1521, folios 23 and 24. They are fully cited and discussed by Keith Maslen in An Early London Printing House at Work: Studies in the Bowyer Ledgers (New York: Bibliographi- cal Society of America, 1993), 123–126. Maslen has found no evidence in the firm's surviving papers that these rules were implemented and enforced in Bowyer's printing operation. He also notes the absence of rules addressing presswork. Richardson's rules survive in the British Library, Additional Manuscript MS 27799, folio 88. They are reprinted in Ellic Howe, The London Compositor: Documents Relating to Wages, Working Conditions and Customs of the London Print- ing Trade (London: Bibliographical Society, 1947), 29–32. Howe did not identify the rules with Richardson's shop. That connection was made by T. D. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel in "Two Notes on Samuel Richardson," The Library 5th ser. 23 (1968): 242–247. Moxon's rules are included in an appendix he prepared for Mechanick Exercises that records "Ancient Customs used in a Printing-house ." Most of the rules Moxon described as representative, but a handful comprised rules of "some particular Chappels ." See Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , ed. Herbert Davis and Henry Carter (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1962), 323–325. Subsequent page references are to this edition of Mechanick Exercises and are cited in parentheses in my text. Because Bowyer's and Richardson's rules are easily located in Howe's and Maslen's books, I dispense with providing parenthetical page references in my text where I quote specific rules. These three sets of chapel rules have figured as valuable historical evidence in bibliographical studies concerned with the late 1600s and the 1700s. Because they imposed standards of behavior on journeymen and promoted order in the complicated technical procedures demanded by concurrent production, the regulations shed light on contemporary shop organization, workplace customs, the relationship between the master and his journeymen, and other aspects of printing. 2 2. For studies of the early regulations, see Frederick C. Avis, "Chapel Rules of the Early Printers," Gutenburg Jahrbuch (1969): 98–102; I. C. Cannon, "The Roots of Organization among Journeyman Printers," Journal of the Printing Historical Society 4 (1968): 99–107; Léon Voet, "The Printers' Chapel in the Plantinian House," The Library , 5th ser. 16 (1961): 1–14; and Jan Materné, "Chapel Members in the Workplace: Tension and Teamwork in the Printing Trades in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries," International Review of Social History 39 (Supplement 2: Before the Unions: Wage Earners and Collective Action in Europe 1300–1850) (1994): 53–83. It should interest scholars, then, to learn that a fourth and practically unknown set of chapel rules from the period is preserved in the British Library's Department of Printed Books. These are conveyed in a broadsheet bearing the headline "Orders to be Observed in this Printing-House." 3 3. Harley 5915, folio 112. The "Orders" is marked item 217 in the volume. I thank Dr. Peter Lindenbaum for acquiring a copy of the "Orders" for me and for sharing his notes on the document. The document is part of the Bagford Title-pages Collection, which was assembled during the late 1600s and early 1700s by John Bagford (1650–1716), a London book dealer and an antiquarian with a keen interest in bibliography. Bagford formed the Collec- tion in anticipation of writing, as he announced in a 1707 subscription proposal, an ambitious but never completed "Historical Treatise, on that most Universally Famous, as well as Useful Art of Typography ." 4 4. J[ohn] Bagford, "An Essay, Towards a Historical Treatise, on that Most Universally Famous, as well as Useful Art of Typography " (London, [1707]). My quotation in the text is from the subscription proposal Bagford circulated in a broadside, but the proposal also circulated in a pamphlet with a sample essay on William Caxton. The Houghton Library at Harvard University holds a copy of the broadside, and the British Library holds copies of both the broadside and the pamphlet. For an account of the two proposals and additional information on the intended breadth of the "Treatise," see the article on Bagford's life and book collecting by Milton McC. Gatch, "John Bagford, Bookseller and Antiquary," British Library Journal 12 (1986): 150–171. Along with approximately 3,600 title pages of early English printed books, Bagford also collected book plates, type specimens, paper samples, printers' and booksellers' devices, book and manu- script auction catalogues, and other materials associated with printing, almost all of which can be dated to a period from 1528 to 1716. 5 5. Although the British Library's web site notes that the Bagford Collection consists of materials originating between 1528 and 1715, at least one item—an engraving of Bagford himself—is dated 1716. Insofar as the whole of the Bagford Collection has been surveyed and its contents enumerated, the "Orders" has not entirely escaped scholarly attention. It has been noted, albeit not described, in a handful of bibliographic publications. A. W. Pollard listed the "Orders" in an article, "A Rough List of the Contents of the Bagford Col- lection," published in the Transactions of the Bibliographical Society for 1902–1904. Ellic Howe glanced at the "Orders" in a footnote in his 1947 book, The London Compositor, Documents Relating to Wages, Working Conditions and Customs of the London Printing Trade, 1785–1900 . And in his 1974 Catalogue and Indexes to the Title-pages of English Printed Books Preserved in the British Library's Bagford Collection , Melvin H. Wolf has taken notice of the "Orders" by reprinting Pollard's "Rough List" in its entirety. 6 6. A. W. Pollard, "A Rough List of the Contents of the Bagford Collection," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society 7 (1902–1904): 149–153; Howe 30, note 1 (see note 1 above for the full Howe citation); and Melvin H. Wolf, Catalogue and Indexes to the Title-pages of English Printed Books Preserved in the British Library's Bagford Collection (London: British Museum for the British Library Board, 1974). As far as I have been able to determine, these are the only three modern works that mention the "Orders." Unfortunately, the "Orders" is something of a fragment. In its original state, the document's dimensions apparently exceeded the leaves of the volume into which it was pasted, and so to make the "Orders" fit Bagford cropped the head, foot, and side margins, and he also cut away a strip of white space in the middle of the sheet between the last rule directed to compositors and the sub-headline over the press room rules (consequently, the "Orders" survives in two pieces and each bears a British Museum stamp). 7 7. Humfrey Wanley implied that Bagford himself did the cutting and pasting as he went about organizing the "Orders" and other materials in Harley 5915 and the other volumes: "His Collection consists chiefly of Title-Pages and other Fragments put together into Books, many of them in some sort of Order and Method, and others not." See "An Essay on the Invention of Printing, by Mr. John Bagford ; with an Account of his Collections for the same by Mr. Humfrey Wanley, F.R.S. Communicated in Two Letters to Dr. Hans Sloane, R.S. Secr.," Royal Society, Philosophical Transactions 25 (1706–1707): 2397–2410. In its cut-down size, the "Orders" measures 32 cm in height and 17 cm in width and it is pasted on a leaf measuring 37.25 cm in height and about 23.8 cm in width. The sheet's chain- lines are vertical. When back-lighted, a watermark is visible. It appears to be the initials AI (or AJ) if one looks at folio 112 recto, or IV (or JV) if one looks at folio 112 verso. Whatever the initials might be, the mark offers no help in dating the "Orders," for it could indicate any one of several dozen late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century English and Dutch paper mills represented in Edward Heawood's Watermarks: Mainly of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (1950; Hilversum [Holland]: Paper Publications Society, 1969) and in W. A. Churchill's Water- marks in Paper in Holland, England, France, etc. in the XVII and XVIII Centuries and their Interconnec- tion (Amsterdam: Hertzberger, 1935). Despite Bagford's pruning, the text of the "Orders"—headline, sub-headlines, and a total of 28 rules—appears wholly in- tact and there is no obvious indication, material or textual, of any missing text. It is certainly possible that in its original state the "Orders" resembled Richardson's chapel rules and included, like Richardson's, a letterpress date as well as the sig- natures of the journeymen who assented to its regulations. Had these been part of the original document, and had they later escaped Bagford's scissors, the "Or- ders" would include information that could help us identify it with a particular printing house doing business at a particular time and place. We can assume the "Orders" was drawn up and printed in or before 1716, for this was the year of Bagford's death and, moreover, no items in the Bagford Collection can be dated beyond 1716. But the document was more likely printed in or before 1706 or 1707. The earlier dates are suggested by a letter from the scholar and antiquarian Humfrey Wanley to Sir Hans Sloane published in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions for the years the 1706–1707. There Wanley briefly describes the contents of the volumes Bagford had assembled for his "Historical Treatise." According to Wanley, "In one Volume there are Specimens of Letters of all sorts, as well as those used in Foreign Countries, as in England ." 8 8. Philosophical Transactions 2407. Of the seven volumes in the Bagford Collection containing items that can be described as "Specimens of Letters ," only one—Harley 5915, the volume that preserves the "Orders"—appears to contain both English and foreign type sheets as well as examples of English and foreign initials. 9 9. The six other volumes are Harley 5922 (containing French initials); Harley 5929 (type specimens of Dr. John Fell); Harley 5930 (Dutch type specimens); Harley 5949 (English type specimens included among newsletters, engravings, writing books, woodcuts, emblems, and other miscellaneous items); Harley 5960 (a single Dutch type specimen); and Harley 5977 (English type specimens included with woodcuts, samples of black-letter printing, and frag- ments of incunabula). Among other materials, this volume includes initials from Basle, Venice, and England; Dutch and English type specimens; proofs of letters made by Moxon, and a type specimen prepared by the late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English printer Hugh Meere. 10 10. Pollard 144. It is more difficult, however, to assign a terminus a quo to the origins of the "Orders." The document is a species of print ephemera and, as numerous mate- rials in the Bagford Collection can attest, Bagford earnestly acquired ephemera produced throughout the seventeenth century and much of the sixteenth century. Still, the "Orders" likely originated no earlier than 1686, or perhaps not too long before 1686. In that year, Bagford became extensively involved with the book trade as a commissioned collector who sought out early printed books for Robert and Edward Harley, Sir Hans Sloane, Samuel Pepys, Bishop John Moore of Ely, and other notable collectors of the time. Bagford continued these efforts into the eighteenth century, for an account book he kept indicates book acquisitions on behalf of various clients as late as 1708. 11 11. Bagford's commissioned book collecting activities are described in Gatch 152–157. No doubt, this activity brought him into numerous printing houses and into contact with numerous master printers, one of whom may have placed the "Orders" in his hands. The terminus a quo of 1686 or thereabouts seems somewhat more plausible if we consider the more or less limited utility of chapel rules in a printing house. As a printing business devel- oped or as conditions of trade changed, a new set of rules incorporating revised or additional regulations could eventually replace an old set. Samuel Richard- son's 1734 rules, for example, probably replaced an earlier set dating from the 1720s, for in their emphasis on haste and efficiency the new rules seem to reflect his increasing involvement in periodical printing. 12 12. T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel, Samuel Richardson: A Biography (Oxford: Clar- endon Press, 1971), 58–66. When Richardson and other masters posted their new regulations, the sheet of superseded rules undoubtedly suffered the same fate as other waste and spoiled paper in a contemporary print- ing house. Unless someone like Bagford asked for it, the sheet was put aside and eventually reused for some other purpose. We might reasonably suppose, then, that the "Orders" would have been lost to posterity had it been printed a good many years prior to Bagford's initial collecting activities in 1686. If the "Orders" cannot be exactly dated, the document and the scope of its regulations are clearly of a piece with the other English chapel rules of the period. Like the Richardson regulations and what we have of the Bowyer regula- tions, the "Orders" is organized into a group of rules concerned with workplace conduct and pertinent to all the journeymen of a shop, another set specifically addressing the work of compositors, and yet another specifically addressing the pressmen. The first group includes prohibitions and fines exacted for gaming, fighting, breaking windows, and leaving burning candles unattended. These rules present nothing out of the ordinary; in one form or another, they also appear in the Moxon, Richardson, and Bowyer regulations. Of the rules focused on compositors and pressmen, the "Orders" also presents nothing extraordinary: among other tasks, compositors are admonished to take care of type and equip- ment, distribute sorts in a timely manner, and correct proof soon after it is read and any errors identified; pressmen are admonished to print proof quickly fol- lowing delivery of a form, to wash forms at day's end, take care of their balls and pelts, and the like. Rules to similar effect appear in Moxon's, Richardson's, and Bowyer's regulations. Numerous interesting but minor differences distinguish the "Orders" from the other chapel rules. For example, here and there Richardson's regulations give the impression that printing at Salisbury Court was considerably more hectic than printing at the shop where the "Orders" originated. "Proofs to be made in a Quarter of an Hour," one of Richardson's rules warned his pressmen (Richardson's compositors were also given a quarter hour to begin corrections). Yet the "Orders" suggests a slightly less hurried pace: the pressmen were required "to make Proof, or Proofs, within an Hour after the Form, or Forms, are brought in" (similarly, the compositors were also allowed one hour to begin correction). Of course, such variations ought to be expected. They ensued from the shops' differing technical resources, financial circumstances, and the number and char- acter of printing jobs they undertook. Neither Moxon's, Richardson's, nor Bowyer's regulations include rules spe- cifically directed towards apprentices, but four such rules appear in the "Orders." Two of these are concerned with apprentice compositors. One rule addresses housekeeping: "The youngest Prentice of this Room, every Wednesday and Satur- day , that he neglects the sweeping, and carrying the Dirt out of this said Room, forfeits Two Pence." The second rule stipulates that "He that's ordered to hang up the Heaps, and does not within two Days after they are wrought off, likewise forfeits Two Pence." Of the two rules directed towards the press room appren- tices, one reiterates the housekeeping rule, charging the youngest apprentice with the sweeping and cleaning, and the other rule is a warning to the same appren- tice: "And that Morning he stirs not the Lye, Two Pence." The "Orders" is also distinctive in lacking a rule or a cluster of rules specify- ing payment of a "bienvenue." This was the traditional entrance fee the jour- neymen of a shop demanded from any new worker and the money was typically used to buy drink for all the workmen. Rules requiring payment of the bienvenue appear in Moxon's, Richardson's, and Bowyer's regulations. Richardson's rules offer us a succinct example: "Every Freeman's Bienvenue, if the first Time of his working in the House, 18 d . Every one not free, but having a Right, 2 s . 6 d . Every one having no Right, 5 s . An Apprentice, 5 s . The eldest Freeman to pay 1 s ." The absence of a similar rule in the "Orders" is noteworthy because, in the eyes of journeymen, the bienvenue was considered a venerable and inviolable printing house tradition. In Mechanick Exercises , Moxon described the fee as an ancient and commonplace practice: "This Benvenue being so constant a Custome is still lookt upon by all Workmen as the undoubted Right of the Chappel , and therefore never disputed" (326). Indeed, rules requiring entrance fees also appear in chapel regulations originating elsewhere in Europe, where as early as the 1550s the pay- ment of a bienvenue already figured as a custom of long standing. 13 13. Voet 4–5. What, if any, significance should we ascribe to this omission in the "Orders"? We might well imagine that the master thought it unnecessary to include a rule or set of rules addressing the bienvenue and specifying a range of fees, because the custom was not only entrenched in contemporary London printing houses, but also because, across certain lengths of time, the fees were likely fixed and stan- dardized throughout the city's shops. Moxon's chapel rules contain only three bienvenues and associated fees, but these—the only English regulations known, with certainty, to survive from the late 1600s—can be compared to no other contemporary record of bienvenues. 14 14. Because they are limited in number and not worded as clearly as we might wish, the three bienvenues recorded by Moxon (326) are difficult to match and compare to those in- cluded in the Richardson and Bowyer regulations. "Every new Workman to pay half a Crown; which is called his Benvenue ," Moxon notes, but his phrase, "new Workman," does not specify the sort of printer who would need to pay the two-shilling, six-pence fee. As the eighteenth- century rules indicate, a London-trained journeyman and freeman of the Stationers' Company was charged a lower fee than a journeyman who was trained elsewhere in England and who was not free of the Company. We encounter the same problem with Moxon's bienvenue directed to a man seeking re-employment at a house where he had previously worked: "If a Journey-man Wrought formerly upon the same Printing House, and comes again to Work on it, [he] pays but half a Benvenue ." Again, Moxon mentions a single fee, "half a Benvenue" (one shilling, three pence). Re-employment is not addressed in the Richardson regulations, but Bowyer's rules de- scribe (using the phrase, "second coming") three re-employment bienvenues: one shilling for a "Freeman"; one shilling, six pence for "Every man having a Right to a Fredom" (sic); and three shillings, six pence for "Foreigners." Moxon's final bienvenue addressed the journeyman who was discovered doing casual work—in effect, "moonlighting"—at another shop, a practice known as "smooting": "If a Journey-man Smout more or less on another Printing House, and any of the Chappel can prove it, he pays half a Bienvenue ." Richardson's rules say nothing about smooting, but the Bowyer rules demand six pence from a "Freeman" and one shilling from a "Foreigner" caught at the practice. However, the Richardson and Bowyer chapel rules do suggest fixed fees. Both specify a five-shilling bienvenue for ap- prentices. They contain rules requiring a one-shilling, six-pence bienvenue from the journeyman who had served a full apprenticeship at London and had become a freeman of the Stationers' Company (or, in some instances, had become a free- man of another city company). And both the Richardson and Bowyer regulations demand a two-shilling, six-pence bienvenue from the journeyman who was, as the Richardson rules put it, "not free, but having a Right"—that is, the workman who had served an apprenticeship outside London and had a right to work, but who did not hold a London freedom. Still, even if bienvenues were consistent from one printing house to another and well known to journeymen, the attention given them in Moxon's, Richard- son's, and Bowyer' rules would suggest that it was indeed necessary to explicitly set forth such rules and the associated fees in chapel regulations. If this was in fact the case, it seems doubtful that experienced workmen composing, proofreading, and printing the "Orders" would fail to notice the absence of a time-honored shop rule. It seems equally doubtful that a master would refuse to comply with a printing house tradition that was, as Moxon explained, "lookt upon by all Workmen as the undoubted Right of the Chappel ," for the workmen could find a means of redressing the situation. When the London master printer John Watts prohibited his men from enforcing a chapel rule that, as they saw it, required Benjamin Franklin to pay a five-shilling bienvenue after Watts moved him from presswork to composing, the men ignored Watts and retaliated against Franklin by mixing his type and breaking up his settings whenever he left the composing room. 15 15. Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography , ed. J. A. Leo Lemay and P. M. Zall (New York: Norton, 1986), 36–37. But perhaps there was a good reason to omit the rule in the "Orders," although explaining the matter would seem to require knowledge of the printing house in question. Despite these various differences, the "Orders," on the whole, has much in common with the other chapel regulations of the period, as most of its rules are either included or implied in the other regulations. Moreover, with the excep- tion of Moxon's rules, which do not specify the monetary value of infractions, the fines recorded in the "Orders" are roughly the same as the fines attached to Richardson's and Bowyer's rules. 16 16 Moxon called the fines "solaces," but the word does not appear in the other rules of the period. He noted that these "were 12 d . 6 d . 4 d . 2 d . 1 d . ob . according to the nature and qual- ity of the Solace " (324). Although we can only compare fines exacted from compositors, the "Orders" and the Richardson and Bowyer rules suggest that most violations would cost the journeyman either one or two pence. Thus, of the nine rules pertinent to compositors in the "Orders," eight carried a two- pence fine and one a four-pence fine. Of the sixteen composing room rules in Richardson's regulations, five carried a one-pence fine, ten a two-pence fine, and one carried either a two-pence or a six-pence fine. And of the eight rules for compositors in the Bowyer regulations, one carried a one-pence fine, four a two-pence fine, one a three-pence fine, one a four-pence fine, and one a six-pence fine. (It should be noted that one of the two-pence fines and the four and six- pence fines represent incremental fines of two pence for every week a compositor failed to his clear work after it was wrought off.) Different commercial circumstances inevitably enveloped different printing businesses, and the demands and temperaments among the masters surely var- ied, but the general parity of fines across these three chapel rules suggests that masters and journeymen shared an understanding of what constituted a fair and reasonable fine. And this was an understanding that apparently persisted across time. If we momentarily assume the "Orders" originated no later than 1706 or 1707—five decades before the Bowyer rules were written down—then we might note that for a period of at least 50 years a two-pence fine remained constant for the same offense: the compositor who neglected tying up and papering type prior to distribution. "Not tying up all Letter (by him us'd) within one Week after using; or tying two-lin'd Letters, White Lines. And Letters of different Bodies, or Faces, up together, Two Pence," so the "Orders" demands. In the Richardson rules, two pence figures as a unit in a potentially costlier fine: "He that lays up an Act or Job for his own Conveniency, to tie up the Pages and Indorsement im- mediately, if not done with. If done with, he that compos'd the Job, or fill'd up the Blanks, to tie them up in Pieces convenient for Papering, in two Days after Notice given of their being laid up, on Forfeiture for every Day's Neglect for every Page or Indorsement, of 2 d ." And the Bowyer rules, as well, impose the two-pence fine: "He that shall neglect tying up Matter as soon as ye Furniture is taken from it, or y[e]t shall leave Matter, or a single line, even of Quadrats on a Board untied 0:0:2." To be sure, the "Orders" reveals no new and significant information about late seventeenth and early eighteenth-century printing houses. But the docu- ment does amplify our knowledge of the work that unfolded and the working conditions that prevailed in those houses. And, it might be added, what Keith Maslen has said of the Bowyer rules seems equally relevant to the "Orders." "If the Bowyer Rules," as Maslen observes, "afford no startling new insights, their general similarity to the earlier sources is a useful reminder that the an- cient practices were continuing to exert a stabilizing influence on a conservative industry." 17 17. Maslen 126. APPENDIX ORDERS To be Observed in this PRINTING-HOUSE. 18 18. I have maintained the spelling and punctuation as well as the use of capital and italic found in the "Orders." Readers can assume the long s appears in the "Orders" where it should be expected to occur in a printed text of the period (at the beginning and middle of a word, but not at the end of a word). The document employs two type fists (that is, pointing hands), which appear in italic text in brackets where they occur in the original document. Finally, the first rule of the "Orders" ("Going out of the House, and leaving his Candle burning, Four Pence.") was typeset with a four-line capital G. First, Every Member of this House forfeits for I. Going out of the House, and leaving his Candle burning, Four Pence. II. Breaking the Windows within a Year after they are made, Four Pence. III. Fighting in the Printing-House, Six Pence. IV. Playing at any Game in the Printing-House, Six Pence. Secondly, Every Member of the Composing-Room forfeits for I. Mis-matching the Cases either in Frames or elsewhere, Two Pence. II. Letting any Case, or part of Case, hang out of the Case-Frame, Two Pence. III. Leaving any two-lin'd Letters, Braces, Rules, &amp;c. in any Cases, Windows, Gallies, or upon Boards, &amp;c. after using, Two Pence. IV. Leaving any Distribution-Notes, Hebrew, Greek, or any other Distribution-Matter, Corrections, or Pye, in either Gallies, Cases, Window, or any other Place, longer than two Days at furthest, Four Pence. V. Not tying up all Letter (by him us'd) within one Week after using; or tying two-lin'd Letters, White Lines, and Letters of different Bodies, or Faces, up together, Two Pence. VI.

IX. Letting fall Letter under his Case, or elsewhere, and not taking up, and distributing, the same, Two Pence. [ type fist ] The youngest Prentice of this Room, every Wednesday and Saturday , that he neglects the sweeping, and carrying out the Dirt of this said Room, forfeits Two Pence. He that's ordered to hang up the Heaps, and does not within two Days after they are wrought off, likewise forfeits Two Pence. Thirdly, Every Member of the Press-Room forfeits for I. Not setting the Friskets behind his Press, out of the way, Two Pence. II. Not putting the Wools in their proper Places, Two Pence. III. Not taking off the Balls on Saturday at Night, Two Pence. IV.

All Money given to either Room (except the Donors stay) to drink, is to be kept in Bank, and spent Quarterly. All that are, or hereafter shall be, Members of this House, must be conformable to these Orders , or liable to the Penalties aforesaid. If any Contest shall arise in any of these Orders aforementioned, it shall be referr'd to the Major Part of the Workmen; and, if they do not decide it, then to the Master. "THE TRAGEDY OF THE BOOK INDUSTRY"? BOOKSTORES AND BOOK DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES TO 1950 by Michael Winship At this point—usually the binder's warehouse—the publisher has books; at that point is the book buyer. Between these two points is the tragedy of the book industry. This statement is taken from O. H. Cheney's 1931 Economic Survey of the Book Industry . Cheney, a banker who had been commissioned by the National Association of Book Publishers to survey the state of the book industry, continues in the same vein: "Between these points [publisher and book buyer] are so many gaps, so many confusions, so much utter ignorance of what is being done that unless these gaps are filled and unless every branch of the industry learns to know exactly what it is doing, the industry, as it is today, is threatened with destruc- tion." All in all, he concludes, "mourning becomes the book industry." 1 1. O. H. Cheney, Economic Survey of the Book Industry, 1930–1931 (New York: National As- sociation of Book Publishers, 1931), p. 224. Dire words indeed! But I would echo Cheney by suggesting that it is the study of book distribution that may well be the "tragedy" of American book history—a lively field over the past decades, as literary and historical scholars came to recognize that the dual role of books as both commodities and carriers of culture makes them important to any understanding of our literature, culture, economy, and society. The work of book historians has firmly established the importance of books in shaping American culture and society, but it has almost completely focused on the role of authors, publishers, and readers, while ignor- ing the fundamental question of just how texts and books found their way from creator to market. Indeed, book historians and literary critics appear to have as- sumed that the books written by authors and issued by publishers reached their readers seamlessly and without mediation; they have paid next to no attention to the mechanisms of book distribution or to how these mechanisms determined the availability of books and thus the kind of reading that the American public engaged in. As a result, virtually every argument that historians of the American book have made over the past decades—about authorship, publishing, audi- ences, reader response, and innumerable other topics—must remain provisional. Each of these arguments relies on untested assumptions about the connections between authors, publishers, and readers, for these connections depend upon the mechanisms of distribution. This failure of book historians is particularly ironic, for the few scholars who have considered the question of book distribution in the United States have often taken the Cheney Report as their source, without (it seems) considering the im- port that Cheney's conclusions might hold for their own work. I can only imagine that the Report's presentation—as a banker, Cheney filled his work with tables, graphs, and charts—has lent it an air of authority, while the implications of its data and the economic moment in which it was prepared have been ignored. Was Cheney correct in his conclusions? Was book distribution truly the "tragedy" of the American book industry? If so, how can we make sense of the fact that book distribution has been so little studied? These are difficult questions to answer definitively, but unless they are an- swered our understanding of a central feature of American book history will remain incomplete and inadequate. It is true that the primary source materials for the study of American book distribution are few and widely scattered, and that, where they do survive, their value is often overlooked or misunderstood; but one important source is the many national directories of American bookstores that were published for the use of the book trade. These directories document the extent of the national network of dedicated retail outlets for books, and in many cases contain not only names and addresses, but also an indication of the size of bookstores' business or their creditworthiness—information that would have been of great use to publishers in filling orders from distant places. The information that they contain also allows us to form a better understanding of the American book distribution system. Far more of these directories were produced than is generally recognized, in part because their survival is uncommon: many exist today in only several cop- ies, and others have disappeared completely. Between 1850 and the turn of the century, at least thirty-two directories of American bookstores were proposed or published, supplemented by four that were limited to dealers in antiquarian or second-hand books. By 1950, an additional thirty directories of general booksell- ers had appeared, plus five for dealers in antiquarian or second-hand books. As far as I can tell, these directories have never been systematically examined or analyzed either by American book historians or by anyone else. The earliest of these bookstore directories remains something of a mystery, as no copy is known to survive. On 1 September 1854, D. Hannegan of New York issued a call for subscriptions for his "private edition" of a Classified Directory of the Booksellers, Stationers, Cheap Publication Sellers of the United States, West Indies, Brit- ish, and South America . Limited to fifty copies at a price of $35, this directory was promised to be "late, complete, and reliable" and was to be "printed in quarto form, on $16.00 paper [the cost per ream], long-primer type, with alternate blank pages for additions, alterations, remarks, &amp;c., and bound in sheep, with spring backs." Hannegan, who was also the publisher of a short-lived trade periodical The Booksellers' Trade List and Publishers' Register , may never have completed and issued this directory, though this seems unlikely: in his call for subscriptions he claims that "twenty-three are already taken up." 2 2. Broadside call for subscriptions for D. Hannegan's Classified Directory of the Booksellers … (1854) sold on eBay 2 Jan. 2009 (item 350145581524). The earliest surviving bookstore directory shares many characteristics with Hannegan's pioneering effort: a work that was available by subscription at a high price in limited numbers. It is O. A. Roorbach's List of Booksellers in the United States and the Canadas , published in New York City in March, 1859. Printed on 128 pages, this directory lists 3,126 sellers of books in some 1,100 towns, arranged alphabetically from Abbeville, NC (one general store, stocking only schoolbooks and serving a population of 400), to Zanesville, OH (four booksellers serving a population of 12,000). Only two copies can be located today. Orville A. Roorbach is chiefly remembered, if at all, for a different pioneer- ing work—his Bibliotheca Americana. A Catalogue of American Publications, Including Reprints and Original Works, from 1820 … Inclusive —that was first issued exactly ten years earlier, March 1849. 3 3. New York: Orville A. Roorbach, for Sale by G. P. Putnam, 1849. This work, later reprinted and supplemented, is the first of what became an ongoing record of American book publication. For an account of its early publication, see Adolph Growoll, Book-Trade Bibli- ography in the United States in the XIXth Century (New York: Dibdin Club, 1898), pp. xviii–xx, xxvii–xxviii. Born at Red Hook Landing on the Hudson River on 20 January 1803, Roorbach entered the book trade in 1817 as an employee of Everett Duyckinck, one of New York's leading booksellers at the time, whom he effectively succeeded in 1825 after purchasing a large portion of the stock. In 1830, Roorbach removed to Charleston, SC, where he sold books "At the Sign of the Red Lion," but returned to New York City in about 1848 to take charge of the wholesale department of Wiley &amp; Putnam. In 1852, he set up on his own in New York as jobber and publisher, but failed in 1857, as did many other book trade firms during the panic that followed the tightening of credit that year. In July 1858, Roorbach began publication of the twice monthly Booksellers' Medium and Publishers' Advertiser , a trade journal, and completed three volumes before his death in June 1861. 4 4. For biographical details on Roorbach see Growoll, Book-Trade Bibliography , pp. xxxix– xli. The Booksellers' Medium prints the earliest notice of Roorbach's directory of booksellers that I have discovered. The issue for 1 January 1859 contains an an- nouncement and call for subscriptions to the work, which was to be published in only 100 copies at the pre-publication price of $25. The announcement describes the work as follows: The list embraces some 1100 Cities and Towns, containing about 3000 names, 2100 of which make Books and Stationery their exclusive business; the remainder are General Dealers, who keep School Books only, and Druggists, who combine Books as a part of their business. The list is believed to be as perfect as can well be made; all the names hav- ing been obtained since May last by direct communication with every city and town, and in addition to which eight of the largest Publishing Houses of this City, for a consideration of so much per town, had the privilege of copying the returns with the understanding that each, for the mutual benefit of all, would add such names as were omitted. The additions obtained in this way was less than 40 names. 5 5. Booksellers' Medium 1 (1 January 1859): 217. This announcement, and the high cost and limited number of Roorbach's pro- posed publication, may have inspired The American Publishers' Circular and Literary Gazette , a rival trade journal published by the New York Book-Publishers' Asso- ciation, to announce a competing directory of American booksellers. The issue of 5 February 1859 printed the following "Notice to Booksellers": We propose to publish, during the present year, a complete list of all booksellers in the United States and Canada , and for that purpose invite the assistance of publishers and booksellers wherever located. We shall take it as an especial favor if our subscribers will communicate the names of all booksellers doing business in their respective localities, and we shall be much obliged to any publishers, who, having new lists, will permit us to compare them with the names we already possess. The names when prepared will be printed in the AMERICAN PUBLISHERS' CIRCULAR and furnished gratuitously to our subscrib- ers. The want of an accurate list has long been a source of annoyance to publishers, and of inconvenience to many booksellers, to whom trade-lists and circulars would other- wise have been addressed; while the best that could be obtained have been the work of much labor and expense, and have been kept for the exclusive use of their owners. We propose undertaking the task for the benefit of our readers who will thus be enabled to obtain a correct list of all booksellers in the United States and Canada without any cost whatever. 6 6. American Publishers' Circular 5 (5 Feb. 1859): 61. Roorbach responded in the 15 February issue of the Booksellers' Medium . After reprinting the notice, he wishes the American Publishers' Circular "God-Speed," but then continues to suggest that a free list is worth exactly what it costs, as publish- ers are unlikely to give their customer information away. He points out that the number of subscribers to the Circular was only 700, whereas the circulation of the Booksellers' Medium was 4,700, and then concludes: Our List of Booksellers is now in the printer's hands; only 100 copies will be printed, and we are pleased to append the annexed names of subscribers , the result of less than one days' efforts in this city, and from our advertisement. In consequence of the proofs having to pass through the hands of three of our most extensive publishing firms who have kindly offered to assist us in our indices , whether Bookseller, Books and Drugs, &amp;c., it will prob- ably be six weeks before the book will be ready for delivery. 7 7. Booksellers' Medium 1 (15 February 1859): 258. A list of twenty-three subscribers to the work, located in Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Springfield MA, and Cincinnati, follows. Roorbach's list, which was available in March or early April, was announced as "now ready" in the Booksellers' Medium of 15 April at the increased price of $40: "Only one hundred copies printed, and less than thirty copies remain on hand, unsold." 8 8. Booksellers' Medium 1 (15 April 1859): 344. But the reception of the list was apparently not completely positive, for in the issue of 15 June Roorbach printed a long note "TO THE SUBSCRIBERS TO ROORBACH'S LIST OF BOOKSELLERS." It gives interesting details on the nature of the list: Since going to press with our Book a friend placed in our hands a List which he had purchased, professing to have the names of 4,500 Booksellers. The possession of this list, (having determined to make our own as perfect as possible,) involved the necessity of communicating with about 450 additional towns, we have replies from some 375 of these, which give names in 103 towns, not included in our list who deal to a considerable extent in books, and some of which are Booksellers. Only one hundred copies of our List was printed, eighty-two of which are already sold, and of this number forty-five are in the hands of our largest dealers, we have seen personally in this City, Boston and Philadelphia, most of the latter, who have agreed as a mutual accommodation to all, to note any discrepancies or omissions and forward them to us. We do not claim that our book is perfect, but do claim, that every name on the List (with the exception of nine myths , inserted to secure copyright) were in business on or since May, 1858, during this period we have communicated by autograph letter with more than 2,700 towns, and with great pleasure acknowledge the replies , which was fully 95 per cent. of the whole, giving much collateral information, though only about 1,300 towns gave the names of firms approximating to the name of Booksellers. As the orthography of proper names is arbitrary, and, in addition, the returns came to us frequently from parties whose chirography were hieroglyphics, sometimes about as intelligible as Chinese char- acters, doubtless many errors have occurred in this respect. We think, however, with the assistance of the purchasers of our List, who will supply us with the information called for it will be as perfect as such a List can well be made. We do not require, or ask, that our friends should expose their Ledger to us, but we do ask that no names be sent, except those they have direct communication with at the present time. A few days since a friend in this city presented a long list of names which we had omitted, many of which we knew were "non est," or from personal acquaintance with the locality, knew no bookstore was there, yet he said some two or three years ago he had sold books to these parties and thought they must be Booksellers. After having received returns from those we now call upon, printed copies of the re- sults will be sent gratuitously to all who may have considered the corrections and additions of sufficient importance as to give their co-operation. 9 9. Booksellers' Medium 1 (15 June 1859): 398. No copy of a supplement of corrigenda and addenda seems to survive, though a copy at Yale, originally owned by G. &amp; C. Merriam, does have a brief inserted errata slip that gives missing information on the population for several towns that had been listed. As time passed, sales must have been slow: on 1 September Roorbach was again advertising the work at its original subscription price of $25, stating that "less than 20 copies remain on hand," and the following 1 May an advertisement for the list states that there were still "about twenty copies remaining." 10 10. Booksellers' Medium 2 (1 September 1859): 54 and 2 (1 May 1860): 353. In the meanwhile, the American Publishers' Circular had not been idle, and in the issue of 6 August 1859 it published a two-page "List of Booksellers in the New England States." This was the first of four such lists: those for the "Middle States," "South- ern States," and "Western States" followed on 19 Sept. 1859, 24 March 1860, and 31 March 1860, respectively. These lists are each designated as "Prepared Expressly for the American Book Circular" and as entered for copyright in the name of that journal's editor, Charles B. Rode. A note in the issue of the Circular with the initial installment explains that the list had been "prepared with no little labor and expense" but that it was "believed to be more accurate than any similar list in the country." The note continues: "In order, however, that it may be made perfect, we shall keep it standing in type for the next two weeks, so as to make any corrections which may be needed, and shall be obliged to whoever will inform us of an errors either of omission or commission." The note concludes by acknowledging "the various correspondents who have revised our proof sheets, and to offer our es- pecial thanks to MESSRS. ADAMS, SAMPSON &amp; Co., of Boston, and WIL- LIAM H. BOYD, Esq., of New York, for their kind permission to make use of the valuable Directories published by them, from which we have derived great assistance." 11 11. American Publishers' Circular 5 (6 August 1859): 377. A note printed in the issue of the Circular that followed the final installment elaborates: We gave in our last issue a list of Booksellers in the Western States, which with those al- ready published completes the list for the United States. In order to make it as accurate as possible, in view of a future corrected publication, we hope that our friends will promptly advise us of any errors or omissions of whatever character which they may discover. On a comparison of the different States it will be perceived that the proportion of Booksell- ers in accordance with population is not always preserved. This may be accounted for by the fact that in some of the States bookselling is a part of the business of nearly every country store, while in others the business is concentrated in centres and in a great degree confined to the bookseller exclusively. It has been entirely impossible to exercise any such discrimination in the list we have prepared, and in regard to the small dealers who unite the sale of books with other business, neither our nor any list can be depended upon for entire thoroughness. But in regard to the regular dealers, those whose business is of any considerable importance, we feel confident that our list is very full and as perfect as may be reasonably expected. It has involved a great deal of labor and expense, and is submitted to the Trade of the United States as a further earnest of our desire and intention to make the AMERICAN PUBLISHERS' CIRCULAR, worthy of their continued confidence and support. 12 12. American Publishers' Circular 6 (7 April 1860): 186. As he had earlier, Roorbach reprinted extracts from this final notice in the Book- sellers' Medium . He remained skeptical, however, and comments facetiously that the lack of discrimination confessed by the Circular "accounts for Illinois having about as many booksellers as all the New England States together, excepting Massachusetts." Nevertheless, he promises his subscribers that "In accordance with our rule of placing 'The MEDIUM' in every channel where advertisers are likely to find results, our paper is sent in detachments to every name on this 'most perfect list,' not included on our own; we, of course, anticipate the receipt of something less than a peck of those 'yellow missives' endorsed 'free, P. O. B.' (Post Office business,) 'not taken out.'" 13 13. Booksellers' Medium 2 (16 April 1860): 326. This dispute does raise, however, the important question of just what kind of retail establishments these two lists were documenting. Roorbach's list provides a key that is suggestive: publishers, booksellers, periodical dealers, dealers in drugs and books, stationers, general dealers who carry school books, and a consider- able number that are classified as dealers who handle books "to what degree un-reported." Explaining this final category, he adds that many "are doubtless, regular Booksellers, yet, it was not considered advisable to assume anything," even if "The locality and population of the Towns, will enable the intelligent Bookseller, to make a fair guess , as to probabilities ." 14 14. Orville A. Roorbach, List of Booksellers in the United States and the Canadas (New York: Roorbach, 1859), leaf 2 recto. FIGURE 1. The retail book department of J. B. Lippincott Co. of Philadelphia in the early 1890s, from "A Brief History of a Great Book House," p. 13, in J. B. Lippincott Company's Classified Catalogue of Publications and Importations (1893), *99SC-2, box 148, Houghton Library, Harvard University. What is noteworthy, however, is the large number of retail outlets that were claimed to have made books and stationery their exclusive business by 1859, about 2,100 according to Roorbach's original announcement for his publication. Just what these dedicated, independent retail bookstores were like—which and how many books they stocked and how they were arranged and presented—is difficult to know exactly, though the few early depictions of the interior of Ameri- can bookstores are suggestive. 15 15. See also A History of the Book in America , vol. 3 [ The Industrial Book, 1840–1880 , ed. Scott E. Casper et al.] (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007), p. 129. Many carried a variety of goods in addition to books and stationery, including games, fancy goods, and such things as razors or musical instruments, even as they identified themselves chiefly as bookstores. With the exception of popular or new books laid out on tables, the book stock itself was chiefly inaccessible to customers, commonly shelved by publisher rather than subject. Thus, customers must have relied on clerks not only for advice, but also for access to most books (perhaps much in the way that we do today when shopping for shoes), though window displays and posted advertising "shewbills" would have drawn attention to new publications. In rural areas outside cities and towns, where the population could not sup- port such dedicated bookstores, a few books, of course, would have been available in country general stores. Even in cities and towns, many must have depended on news agents, friends, and, especially as the century progressed, libraries and de- partment stores for their reading material. Some book buyers must have ordered directly from publishers, receiving their purchases by mail, and others may have employed agents in the major publishing centers to assist in their book purchases. But I believe that dedicated, independent bookstores, exactly of the kind that the directories in this checklist document, had by 1850 become the center of the American national trade book distribution system. The early rise of a national book distribution system in the United States depending on bookstores, as suggested by these first directories, is something of a surprise, for by the 1850s the publishing industry was coincidentally be- coming increasingly concentrated in three major east coast cities—New York, Philadelphia, and Boston—just as the United States became more extensive, growing to stretch across the entire North American continent. The rise of the dedicated, independent bookstore seems to have been an important development of the antebellum decades, however, for James Green assures me that he has yet to find anything similar in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Into the 1820s, every bookseller whose trade appears to be confined to retailing books and stationery turns out, on closer examination, also to be involved in printing, publishing, wholesaling, or book binding—at least occasionally—or else the bookseller served as agent for an urban publisher. Would it not have made more sense for there to have risen an expanding network of interdependent, regional markets for books, supporting publishers and retailers, that continued the pattern that was characteristic of the early decades of the nineteenth century? To some extent, this earlier system did persist—certainly this is true of newspapers, many of which, even today, are regional or local in nature—but what is striking is that the book industry, especially that concerned with what have come to be termed "trade books," became truly national in character. The contradiction between the concentration of the book publication and production industry in the east and the expansion of the market for books across the continent is a defining characteristic of the modern American book trade and is surely the primary cause of what Cheney refers to as the "tragedy" of the book industry. In order to function effectively, this national book distribu- tion system needed to develop means for managing the transportation of books to buyers from the centers of publication, as well as for the efficient exchange of information and transfer of credit. Just how that happened is something that historians of the American book have not yet adequately addressed, but these directories do suggest that by the 1850s the American book trade was, at very least, beginning to do so. So what then are we to make of Cheney's 1931 characterization of American book distribution system as a tragedy, in danger of bringing the book industry to the brink of extinction? Cheney's pessimism is perhaps understandable, given that he was writing at the beginning of the Great Depression of the 1930s, yet the book industry survived, carrying on in much the same way as it had for many years. Elsewhere in his study, Cheney is more qualified, if less colorful. On the one hand, despite his many recommendations for improvement, Cheney found himself unable to offer "any plan for transforming the book industry into 'big business' overnight," and he admits that "no single major solution is pos- sible." 16 16. Cheney, Economic Survey , pp. 5, 321. His recommendations suggest not a broad-based reorganization of the book industry, but rather means by which the current book distribution system might be changed to effect greater efficiency and profit. On the other hand, he explains that "in the conditions pictured in this report, the book industry is like every other American industry" and that "No industry in the country is in a position to gloat over the book industry." 17 17. Cheney, Economic Survey , p. 4. Taking the long view—from 1850 to 1950, say—and considering the considerable growth in the American economy over that period, it does not seem reasonable to view American industry—or the book industry, for that matter—in such an unfavorable light. Even if they were broken, they both managed to function remarkably well over the long term. Of course, Cheney's analysis does raise the imponderable question of just what would have been a more successful book distribution system? Cheney him- self was unable to offer a real alternative, although the history of the book in America offers several. Most important are the various subscription schemes, from the use of door-to-door canvassers that flourished in the years after the Civil War to the many book clubs that use the mails for distribution and that first emerged in the 1920s. These have been a persistent feature of the American book trade from colonial times, and while they have certainly supplemented the na- tional trade book distribution system that depended on dedicated, independent retail bookstores, they have never succeeded in supplanting it. But if the American book distribution system came to depend on dedicated, independent retail bookstores, how successful were these stores in reaching the extensive market for books in the United States? An answer to this question will only emerge from a full analysis of the directories of bookstores listed here. As far as I know, there were no similar directories that document the presence of, say, dedicated shoe stores throughout the United States before 1950, but the thought that there might be raises a useful comparison. No doubt there were many villages and small towns that lacked a single shoe store, but this situation can scarcely suggest that most rural Americans have gone unshod all these years. Of course, many Americans may have chosen not to wear shoes, either by choice or from lack of means, but I doubt that most could not have done so if they had wished. I suspect that the same is true of books: the distribution system for books may not have been completely efficient, as Cheney noted, but it was probably effective. Those who wished to read undoubtedly found ways to find the books that they wanted. As evidence, perhaps exceptional but still suggestive, I offer Swante Palm, a Swedish immigrant and resident of Austin, Texas, where he moved in 1850 and served as Swedish vice-consul from 1866 until his death in 1899. 18 18. For biographical details on Swante Palm, see the entry for "Swen Jaensson" in The Handbook of Texas Online at http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/JJ/fja41.html. Palm was an inveterate and enthusiastic book collector, and by the 1850s he was regularly adding books that had been recently published in New York and other eastern publishing centers to his library. I have been unable to discover the details how he managed to do this—I cannot imagine that Texas bank notes had much currency in Manhattan—but the evidence that he did so successfully are today everywhere in the stacks of the libraries at the University of Texas: in 1897 Palm donated the greater part of his library of about 12,000 volumes to the University, increasing the number of volumes in the University's library by over sixty percent. Among many other works, Palm's donation included, for example, several by Walt Whit- man: the privately printed second issue of his 1865 collection of Civil War poems Drum-Taps , the 1882 first edition of Specimen Days , and a late reprint of the 1860 third edition of Leaves of Grass . Bookstore directories show that by 1859 in Austin, where the population was then a mere 4,500, Palm would have had the choice of two bookstores to patronize, though I suspect that his appetite for books would have required him to establish supplemental means for acquiring books for his collection. Just over a quarter of a century later, in 1886, the population of Austin had quadrupled to 18,000, and there were five bookstores, the largest of which had an estimated capital investment of $20,000 to $30,000. This situation continued into the twen- tieth century: in 1907, with a population of 22,258, Austin was again listed with five bookstores, the largest of which did a business of over $25,000 per annum. By 1928, the population had grown to 38,200, and the number of bookstores was seven, not counting the book department in Scarborough's department store on Congress Avenue. The evidence in these directories suggests that the figures for Austin are typical of many other cities and towns across the nation. Today, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the United States does seem to be undergoing a reorganization of our book distribution system, driven by improved means, chiefly digital, of information and inventory control and an influx of corporate capital. The result has been the increasing dominance of chain bookstores located in malls, free-standing corporate "super stores," and especially internet book distributors like Amazon.com. Our reaction to these changes has been ambivalent, and we are all familiar with the many nostalgic laments over the loss of many of our independent retail bookstores. But this am- bivalence is not new: in 1952 the American Booksellers Association distributed a booklet by Adolph Kroch entitled Bookstores Can Be Saved: 14 Proposals Answering the Question, "What Is Wrong with the Bookstores." 19 19. Adolph Kroch, Bookstores Can Be Saved: 14 Proposals Answering the Question, "What Is Wrong with the Bookstores" (Chicago: Booksellers Catalog Services, 1952). Perhaps we should, taking our cue from Cheney, withhold judgment, for I suspect that today we all benefit from greater access to the products of the American book industry than ever before. But I also believe that the directories of booksellers listed here provide notable evidence that the earlier trade book distribution system, established in the de- cades before the Civil War and centered on bookstores, functioned effectively for over one hundred fifty years. Directories of American Bookstores to 1950 This checklist includes all the national directories of bookstores in the United States and Canada to 1950 that I have discovered. My goal has been to make a record of the reference tools that were prepared or proposed for the use of the American book trades and that provided publishing and jobbing firms—which were increasingly becoming concentrated in a few, mostly east coast, cities—a means of gauging the nature of the market for their books. Thus, I have omit- ted the many city directories published during the period that were not specifi- cally aimed at the book trades, though these will in many cases provide useful information on the local or regional market for books. Also omitted is the set of pre-printed, perforated, and gummed mailing labels of American bookstores that was prepared for sale by the Business Address Co. of New York in 1883 and, presumably, in other years. 20 20. The set of these labels for 1883 survives, remarkably, in a scrapbook at NN. Reluctantly, I have decided not to include the series called The Typo Credit Book of the Paper, Book, Stationery, Printing, Publishing and Kindred Trade in the United States and Canada , published by the Typo Mercantile Agency. This firm, incorporated in 1896 and continuing in business until at least the 1940s, primarily provided credit information on the book trades, including bookstores, and the volumes it published usefully serve as a complement to the directories listed here. 21 21. Only three of this series of credit reports have been located: for 1909 ( not seen; infor- mation supplied by Anne Johnson regarding a copy at ViW), and for 1924 and 1936 (both at NN). Two brief, early lists of American booksellers deserve special mention: "List of Booksellers in the Principal Cities and Towns in U. S.," Booksellers' Advertiser 1 (December 1834): 95, and "List of Publishers and Booksellers, in the Different States, Cities and Towns, as Far as Returned to the Compiler, July, 1848" in Alexander V. Blake, Supplement to the American Bookseller's Complete Reference Trade List (Claremont, NH: Claremont Manufacturing Co., 1848), p. [231]. Examina- tion of these lists shows that, in general, they use the term booksellers in its earlier sense that does not clearly distinguish it from those who in the nineteenth century were increasingly coming to be known as publishers , and for this reason I have decided to record the existence of these lists here but have not included them in the checklist. Entries in the checklist, numbered sequentially, are grouped by publisher or compiler, with groups arranged chronologically by the earliest entry in each. The main section of the checklist contains general directories of bookstores in the United States and Canada and is followed by a second section of directories of bookstores that dealt specifically in second-hand or antiquarian books. The bookstores listed in the directories in the first section would have usually stocked new publications, but it is probable that many also carried used or old books in addition to stationery and other goods. Tables 1 and 2 provide an overview and index to the checklist. The entries themselves should be self-explanatory. Title-page transcriptions are regularized, but with the first letter of each word given in the case, upper or lower, of the original. Omissions are indicated by marks of ellipses; interpolations are enclosed within full-size square brackets, while square brackets that appear on the original title page are transcribed using a smaller square bracket. In the pagination statement, full detail is given for the preliminary and final pages, but only the first and final page numbers are reported for the main sequence of the text. One unusual feature of some of these directories is that the endpapers are included in the printed pagination, as indicated, and in such cases, no page number has been inferred for the first and final pages of the pastedown end leaves (the recto of the front and verso of the rear pastedown)—these are not visible and presumably blank. The location of copies is indicated by standard NUC symbols, with the ad- dition of "MBW" for copies in my personal collection.

Dupont * * This essay is an edited version of an address given at the Annual Meeting of the Biblio- graphical Society of the University of Virginia on 23 March 2007. That address was based on a lecture given at Cornell University Library on 5 May 2005 in conjunction with the exhibi- tion "The Passionate Collector: Willard Fiske and His Libraries," mounted in the Hirshland Exhibition Gallery, Carl A. Kroch Library, Cornell University, from 10 February through 28 May 2005; see: http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collector/index.html (accessed 7 September 2009). For their gracious support and expert help at many stages of my research, I wish to express my gratitude to Elaine Engst, Director and University Archivist, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library, and her staff, especially Patrick Stevens, Curator of the Fiske Icelandic, Petrarch and Dante Collections, and Katherine Reagan, Ernest Stern '56 Curator of Rare Books and Manuscripts and Assistant Director for Collections. I also wish to thank G. Thomas Tanselle for the invitation to speak to the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia and David Vander Meulen for encouraging me to edit my presentation for this publication. Funding for my initial research at Cornell University in 2002 was provided by the University of Notre Dame, where I was then employed as curator for special collec- tions, through grants from the Paul R. Bryne Fund, Hesburgh Libraries, and the Francis M. Kobayashi Research Travel Fund, Office of Research. Daniel Willard Fiske (1831–1904) was a man of assorted ambitions and odd occupations. Indeed, the disparate facts that might constitute a biograph- ical sketch would hardly seem to concern the same man: he was a nationally ranked chess player and the founder of American Chess Monthly; he worked as a clerk in a post office in Syracuse, New York, where he also wrote for the local newspaper; during his sophomore year at Hamilton College he was suspended for stealing firewood from the chapel supply; in the space of an hour after hear- ing the news of Lincoln's assassination, he crafted a stirring editorial that was reprinted for years afterwards in dozens of newspapers and magazines; for the space of a year, he was married to a woman who died of tuberculosis and made him rich; he spent several years promoting the Romanization of modern Egyp- tian Arabic; he mastered perhaps forty languages; his favorite country was Ice- land, though he visited only once; he spent almost a third of his life living in splendid villas around Tuscany. Yet this series of facts—remarkable though it might seem—communicates little of Fiske's actual biography and principal pursuits, which comprised serving as a professor of northern European languages at Cornell University and its first librarian, and distinguishing himself above all as a collector of books pertain- ing to his eclectic passions, including, notably, the subject of this essay: Dante. I became interested in Fiske in 2000, when curiosity led me to research the origins of a collection of Dante books gathered by Rev. John Augustine Zahm, C.S.C., at the University of Notre Dame, where I was then curator for special collections. I soon discovered that the little-known historic Dante library was third in size and completeness after the Dante collections at Harvard and Cor- nell. 1 1. The fruits of my study of the Zahm Dante Collection at the University of Notre Dame have been published as "Collecting Dante in America at the End of the Nineteenth Century: John Zahm and Notre Dame," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 95:4 (December 2001), 443–481; "Giulio Acquaticci e John Zahm collezionisti di Dante," in Atti del convegno "Quei battenti sempre aperti: gli Acquaticci e Treia nella cultura marchigiana " (Treia: Accademia Georgica, 2002), 99–154; and an earlier essay, coauthored with Louis Jordan and Theodore J. Cachey, Jr., "The John A. Zahm Dante Collection," in What is Written Remains: Historical Essays on the Libraries of Notre Dame , ed. Maureen Gleason and Katharina J. Blackstead (Notre Dame and London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1994), 85–104. Interested as to how and why these collections were formed at such diverse institutions all during the final decades of the nineteenth century, I embarked on an investigation of the surviving clues, whether they lay in library catalogs and re- ports, files of bookseller receipts and correspondence, or in the books themselves. Thus, I initially encountered Fiske as a rival to Zahm, though I quickly learned how much greater a collector he was and how prominent in Cornell's institutional history. Over the course of several extended visits to Cornell, I ex- amined carefully most of the evidence that pertains to Fiske's Dante collecting. There was much to sort through: nearly four hundred items of correspondence alone. From this investigation, I have tried to piece together not only the "how" of Fiske's collecting, but also the "why" of it: why Dante, why Cornell—why then, why at all? What did it matter at the time that Fiske managed to assemble the largest collection of works in America by and about the author of the Divine Comedy , and what did his actions gain for those who came after? To understand how and why Fiske assembled his Dante library, it will be helpful first to retrace the rough outlines of his biography in order to bring the sundry particulars cited above into a more coherent picture of his multifaceted character and career. 2 2. Convenient biographical sketches of Fiske may be found in Morris Bishop, A History of Cornell (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1962), 107–109, and Horatio S. White, ed., Memorials of Willard Fiske, Collected by his Literary Executor, Horatio S. White (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1920), 1:ix–x, as well as Horatio S. White, "A Sketch of the Life and Labors of Pro- fessor Willard Fiske," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 12 (April 1918), 71. Other papers published in this volume of PBSA as a memorial tribute to Fiske included Mary Fowler, "Willard Fiske as a Bibliographer" (pp. 89–96), Halldór Hermannsson, "Willard Fiske and Icelandic Bibliography" (pp. 97–106), William H. Carpenter, "Willard Fiske in Iceland" (pp. 107–115), Elisa Jehsen, "Willard Fiske's Writings on Iceland" (pp. 116–127), and a bibliog- raphy, "Catalogues of the Fiske Collections at Cornell" (pp. 127–129). See also the article on Fiske in Carl L. Cannon, American Book Collectors and Collecting from Colonial Times to the Present (New York: H. W. Wilson, 1941), 132–136, which draws upon and summarizes elements from the preceding and from Horatio S. White, Willard Fiske, Life and Correspondence: A Biographical Study (New York: Oxford University Press, American Branch, 1925), but in so doing introduces certain factual errors (e.g., in his "old age," Fiske did visit Copenhagen a few times, but Cannon exaggerates the truth when he writes that Fiske was "lured back" "almost every summer" (p. 133). Fiske was born in Ellisburg, a small town in northern New York, on 11 No- vember 1831. When he was sixteen, the family moved slightly south to Cazenovia and later to Syracuse. On his father's side, he was related to General Clinton B. Fisk (1828–90), for whom Fisk University was named, and Harvard historian FIGURE 1. Portrait of Willard Fiske, ca. 1900.

The final silent "e" was sometimes dropped and sometimes added to the family name across its branches and generations. According to the Fisk/e Family Association, "John Fiske adopted his mother's maiden name, which was Fisk without the 'e.' When the Connecticut Legislature approved the name change, they erroneously spelled it Fiske, so John Fisk became John Fiske" (see http://www.fisk-fiskefamilyassociation.com/thefamous.html and http://www.fisk- fiskefamilyassociation.com/homefaq.html , accessed 7 September 2009). From his mother's side, he could claim two Harvard presidents and two Harvard librarians as ancestors. Nevertheless, his immediate family being of humble station (his mother had to supplement the income of his semi-invalid father with her dressmaking), Fiske was educated locally, first at Cazenovia Seminary and then at Hamilton College. He left the latter without graduating, though presumably not on account of his impious theft. Rather, he appears to have been seized with Wanderlust: having reached his eighteenth year, Fiske trekked abroad to study the Old Norse sagas and Scandinavian languages. He sojourned briefly in Copenhagen and then ventured to Sweden, were he enrolled for two years at the University of Uppsala. A testi- mony to his unusual capacity for learning languages, he delivered there a series of lectures in Swedish on American literature. He otherwise supported himself by working as a correspondent for various American periodicals. During his journey homeward, Fiske passed through Germany, where he allowed himself to make a detour to the medieval town of Wolffenbüttel. The twenty-one-year-old self-fashioned scholar described his visit thus in a diary vi- gnette later published in the Syracuse Daily Star: The little town which formed our destination for the day had long been a sort of Mecca to me, inspiring me more and more as I approached nearer to it. It contains one of the rich- est and oldest book collections in Germany—one whose value it would be as sacrilegious as impossible to reckon in dollars. I fear that I have not yet learned to use or appreciate properly their contents and teachings, yet there is something in me, you may liken it to the untutored affection of the swain if you will, which teaches me to love even the titles and outsides of books. No human thing excites within me half the awe and reverence I feel as I walk through the halls of a well-stored library, and even the sublimity of nature scarcely affects me so much. A huge mountain is only a heaping-up of matter, this is a vast accumulation of mind. 4 4. White, ed. Memorials of Willard Fiske , 2:122, quoted from the Syracuse Daily Star , 19 Novem- ber 1852. Upon returning to the United States in 1852, Fiske took a position as as- sistant librarian to Joseph Cogswell at the Astor Library in New York City. This was undoubtedly a formative experience for Fiske, one that would confirm his future as a librarian, book collector and ultimately bibliographer. The Astor Library, created through a foundation bequest of fur merchant and real estate tycoon John Jacob Astor in 1849, was one of the first publicly-accessible reference libraries in the country, and, consequently, one of the first to introduce modern methods of cataloging books and to provide assistance to readers who wished to consult them. Fiske's own notions of a library, his ideals and values, meshed with Cogswell's and flourished under his guidance. Frank Norton, an associate on the Astor Library staff, confirmed that Fiske fit well the new persona of a librarian that Cogswell aimed at cultivating: His perceptions were sharp and accurate, and he could divine at once just what an igno- rant reader needed to help him out of his difficulty; and, with his comprehensive familiar- ity with the library, could supply at once the works needed. This was, in fact, our chief duty; to understand what the reader wanted to learn; and then, from the library shelves, give him the necessary books to answer his purpose…. He was also kind and courteous to everybody; and his knowledge of languages of course was of great assistance in the case of the many foreigners who used the library. He was always particularly kind and helpful to school boys and college students, and consequently very much liked by them. 5 5. Quoted in White, "A Sketch of the Life and Labors of Professor Willard Fiske," 71. Fiske's perspicacity evidently also served him well in one of his chief pastimes, chess—which he discovered, incidentally, while studying Persian. He was a top player, who more famously founded American Chess Monthly in January 1857 and organized the first American Chess Congress, held in New York later the same year. Fiske left the Astor Library in 1859 to serve as general secretary and librar- ian of the American Geographical Society. The following year, he was engaged as an attaché to the United States Legation in Vienna, after which he returned to live with his parents in Syracuse, and entered what may be described as an incubatory phase of his life. He worked for a time as a postal clerk and part- ner in a bookstore while writing articles for Appleton's New American Cyclopaedia and resuming his journalistic career as a writer and editor for the Syracuse Daily Journal (for which he composed his emotive and oft-reprinted editorial on the assassination of Lincoln). He frequently commented on civil service issues, urging reforms based on his observations of foreign governments. A few years later, Fiske joined the staff of the Hartford Courant , whose editor, Charles Dudley Warner, had been his Hamilton College roommate. While on assignment in Egypt in 1868 to report on the opening of the Suez Canal (where he also developed his interest in the Romanization of the Egyptian alphabet 6 6. Fiske wrote a number of articles and pamphlets on the subject, the substance of which he gathered into a volume titled An Egyptian Alphabet for the Egyptian People (Florence: Landi Press, 1897). ), Fiske received and accepted an invitation from the fledging Cornell University to serve as professor of northern European languages and librarian. In the latter role, Fiske applied the modern methods of library management and ideals of scholarly service that he practiced at the Astor Library, model- ing Cornell's new library as a non-circulating reference collection, open nine hours a day. By contrast, most university libraries at the time, especially those in urban areas, operated according to an opposite scheme. On the assumption that students had access to other area libraries, they offered few open hours but permitted borrowing. Because Ithaca was a relatively isolated and rural town, with no nearby libraries able to serve academic needs, Fiske strove hard to build Cornell's collections from a modest budget, and even returned a portion of his own salary each year to help pay binding expenses. Through his difficult labors, and perhaps more on their account than in spite of them, he developed a deep and lasting love for Cornell, one that would endure beyond the severe personal tensions that lay ahead. Surely another source of Fiske's devotion to Cornell, and reason for accepting his appointments in the first place, was the intimate friendship he shared with its president, Andrew Dickson White. Fiske and White were boyhood companions, and they renewed their acquaintance during Fiske's years in Syracuse. The two men were drawn together, no doubt, by their love for books and their interest in European affairs and history. Fiske seems to have been the only member of the Cornell faculty to address White by his first name. When Fiske took a leave of absence in 1879 for reasons of health, White loaned him money so that he could travel to Iceland and visit several cities in Europe. White then advanced him additional funds to buy an engagement ring to present to Miss Jennie McGraw, the only child of Cornell trustee John McGraw, who had recently passed away, leaving his daughter most of his considerable es- tate. Yet Jennie herself was suffering from tuberculosis and at best reckoning had only a few months to live. Thus, as the various facts came to be known, Ithacans began to suspect a plot whereby Fiske's marriage to Miss Jennie was contrived to guarantee that her father's money would be safely harbored with Cornell and not some other suitor, of whom there were several. If, however, there was such a plot (the surviving evidence is unclear), all did not go as precisely as planned. Fiske did marry Jennie in Berlin in July 1880, and she did die very soon after their return to Ithaca in the fall of 1881. Yet when it came time to settle her will, the interested parties became sharply divided, with Cornell trustees Henry Sage (McGraw's former business partner) and Judge Douglass Boardman (an influen- tial district court justice who served as executor) on one side, Fiske and Jennie's next-of-kin on the other, and A. D. White caught in the middle trying to mediate reconciliation or compromise. 7 7. Bishop devotes a full chapter of his History of Cornell to "The Great Will Case" (pp. 224–232). The conflict erupted when Fiske discovered that Sage and Boardman had become aware of a limiting clause in the land-grant university's charter that pre- vented it from holding real and personal property in excess of an aggregate of three million dollars, thus making it ineligible to receive most of Jennie's generous bequests, which were estimated to include at least a million dollars for Cornell, including two hundred thousand dollars for a new library. Fiske, meanwhile, apparently received and invested all or most of the three hundred thousand dollars she had left to him. All probably would have gone well had the trustees informed Fiske directly of their intention to request the state legislature to amend the charter, just as Boardman had been direct in asking Fiske to sign a pre-nup- tial agreement nullifying any claims to Jennie's wealth. Nonetheless the trustees acted underhandedly according to Fiske, even scheduling the final settlement of the estate at a time when they knew he would be out of the country. Instead of cooperating with their plans, Fiske, at the suggestion of a local apprentice lawyer, decided to file suit and break the provisions of his wife's will that profited the university on grounds that they could be construed to violate laws designed to protect the interests of surviving heirs (according to state law, a decedent with surviving heirs was prohibited from giving more than half his estate to charity). Fiske lost the first round of court battles, but won on appeals right up to the Supreme Court of the United States, which issued its ruling in May 1890. Prior to this last appeal, Sage had offered to build a library for Cornell that would receive Jennie's endowment if his side should win; if not, the library would be his gift. At an expense of half a million dollars, the library and the iconic clock tower erected beside it in 1891 in tribute to Jennie ended up costing Sage nearly what Fiske finally inherited as Jennie's widower after McGraw family members and the lawyers claimed their share. 8 8. A bronze plaque at the entrance to the library (now Uris Library, after the benefactor whose gift refurbished the building in 1962) reads: "The good she tried to do shall stand as if 'twere done / GOD finishes the work by noble souls begun. / In loving memory of JENNIE MCGRAW FISKE whose purpose to / found a great library for Cornell University has been defeated / this house is built and endowed by her friend / HENRY W. SAGE. 1891" The set of nine chimes that Jennie McGraw had given to the university to celebrate its inauguration in 1868 were moved to the tower upon its completion, where they were joined by ten new chimes. Fiske's disillusionment over the convoluted and painful affair, in which most Ithacans regarded him as the villain, led him to resign his Cornell posts in 1883. Fiske then established residence in Florence, Italy, renting at first the Villa Fo- rini, formerly occupied by American minister George P. Marsh, and taking his seventy-eight-year-old widowed mother with him. As part of the large Anglo- American expatriate community, the Fiskes entertained fellow Americans on their travels, including Mark Twain and Henry James. With his characteristi- cally acerbic wit, James once remarked that he found Fiske, "though friendly and hospitable, an absolutely colourless little personage." 9 9. Leon Edel, ed., Henry James. Letters (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980), 3:166. Fiske's mother fared better in his estimate, earning praise, however ironic, for being "the most self-possessed American he ever knew." 10 10. Quoted in the obituary for Caroline Willard Fiske that appeared in the Jefferson County Journal (Adams, NY), 16 November 1897. Apart from such punchy and more pleasant social interludes, Fiske settled into a life of scholarly leisure, devoting most of his time and energy, if not money, to collecting books. In addition to expanding the impressively comprehensive Icelandic collection that he had begun assembling as a student, and occasion- ally purchasing books on chess, he added to the Petrarch collection that he had started while honeymooning in Europe. After his aging mother returned to the aid and company of other family members in New York in 1888, Fiske rented a studio apartment in Florence proper, in Via Lungo il Mugnone. In 1892, following the settlement of the "Great Will Case," as it had come to be known, and the subsequent freeing-up of financial as well as emotional re- sources, Fiske purchased a spacious villa built around an old medieval tower near the town of San Domenico, in the hills overlooking Florence. Formerly occupied by English poet Walter Savage Landor, it had been left vacant and in disrepair, and Fiske invested a tidy sum to expand and modernize it. 11 11. According to White, Willard Fiske, Life and Correspondence , 155, Fiske "purchased the Villa Landor for about 100,000 lire and had spent a similar amount in repairs and improve- ments." For detailed accounts of Fiske's renovations to the Landor's villa, see Henrietta Irving Bolton, "A Florentine Villa," New-York Evening Post 24 March 1894 (a copy of the article clipping may be found pasted on the front inside cover of a photograph album of the villa at Cornell University Library: Views of the Villa of Walter Savage Landor (in the Commune of Fiesole, I 3/4 Miles from Florence) in which He Wrote Many of the Imaginary Conversations, Now the Property of Willard Fiske: A Series of Photographs Taken April, 1892 [call no. arZ137 ++]) and Lilian Whiting, The Florence of Landor (London: Gay and Bird, 1905), 289–294. The Fiske Papers at Cornell also pre- serve original correspondence, account books and receipts pertaining to the renovations. For additional contemporary articles that mention Fiske's renovations, see Laurence Hutton, "The Literary Landmarks of Florence," Harper's New Monthly Magazine 93:558 (November 1896), 912, and Lee Bacon, "Florentine Villas," Scribner's Magazine 19:3 (March 1896), 327–328. Today the villa is occupied by the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole. It was from this bucolic retreat overlooking Florence and a branch of the Africo, where the pro- tagonists of Boccaccio's Decameron had gathered centuries before to tell their tales, that Fiske pursued his bibliographic labors—preparing a catalog of the fruits of his most recent book-hunting quest for works printed in Rhaeto-Romanic dialects, 12 12. See Willard Fiske, Catalogue of the Rhaeto-Romanic Collection Presented to the Library (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library, 1894). corresponding with booksellers and scholars about his Icelandic and Petrarch collections, 13 13.

On one of these acquisition tours, in late April 1892, Fiske purchased a copy of the Divina Commedia that was destined to become the first volume in the mas- sive Dante collection that he would assemble for Cornell University Library. In a postcard to George William Harris, who had ably succeeded him as librarian, Fiske wrote: "I send you a copy of Dante—(Giolito) Stagnino edition of 1536. It is, I believe, complete, but in a sad binding. No special value attached to the edition so far as I know. Should the library already possess a copy of it, please forward this to the library at Dryden." 14 14.

Dryden is a township near Ithaca where relatives of Jennie McGraw Fiske built a public library with funds they received from her estate following the resolution of the "Great Will Case." With these few lines, Fiske meant sim- ply to dispose of an odd volume that he came across while browsing through a bookseller's stock in hopes of enriching his Petrarch collection. He only bought the Dante, he later confessed, because he thought it unusual, and—probably just as relevant—inexpensive. With good reason: it proved to be infected! In a reply to Fiske, Harris wrote: "The Dante of 1536 was duly received. It was not in the Library, so we keep it with thanks. On examination of the binding, we found it contained some live bookworms, and the binding was handed over to Professor Comstock who was delighted to get the little pests, and is carefully nursing them in confinement." 15 15. GWH, letter to DWF, 9 June 1892, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 6, CUL. Bookworms, common in earlier centuries, had become something of an endangered species in modern libraries. According to an article that later appeared in the popular New York Sunday World , it was only the third time in recent history that live bookworm larvae had been discovered and raised to maturity. 16 16.

A version of the same article with accompanying illustration of the volume's spine appeared in the Thrice-A- Week World , 2 March 1896, and is preserved in a clipping in a similar scrapbook that Theodore Wesley Koch created and gave to the Harvard College Library for its Dante collection; see Widener Dn 580.6, vol. 2, p. 7. Another year went by before Fiske's letters reported any further acquisitions of Dante material, but thereafter the references became more frequent. While on one of his buying expeditions in Palermo and southern Italy in February 1893, Fiske wrote to Harris to tell him to expect a package of Dante books that he had posted to him. Again in May, he sent another such report, concluding it with a modest yet anticipatory proposal: "I have been a good deal ill and a good deal busy," he began, referring to his continued bouts with the pneumonia he had contracted in Palermo, "or I should have written earlier to say that I am sending the library some packages of Dante books—partly the spoils of my own shelves, partly taken from the antiquarians here and elsewhere. I don't stop to bind them because of the lack of time and strength." 17 17. DWF, letter to GWH, 23 May 1893, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [218], CUL. Fiske quotes this passage in his "Introductory" to the catalogue that would be published in due course; see Theodore Wesley Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 2 vols. (Ithaca, NY: Printed for Cornell University Library by John Wilson and Son, University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1898–1900), 1:v. The genesis and publication of the catalogue is discussed below. He then went on: "My idea is—if it seems good to you—that the Dante books you already have and those now sent you should be entered in one of your early bulletins, so as to form a basis on which to build." Fiske thus referred to the practice that he had encouraged Harris as his successor to follow of publishing periodic lists of recent acquisitions, typically grouped around some common subject as a way of featuring an emerg- ing area of collecting interest. In another letter a week later, Fiske elaborated his suggestion: "Reflecting on the matter, perhaps you may deem it wise to add to the next Bulletin a supplement of two-line titles under some such title as: Hand- list of Dante Books in the University Library. This will be much cheaper and will show equally well what the Library has and indicate what it wants. It would occupy only a very few pages. Of Dante bibliographies—with full titles—there are already many. What do you think of this?" 18 18. DWF, letter to GWH, 27 May (1893), DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [219], CUL. Harris replied, "I think your suggestion of a list of two-line titles would be better than the printing of a list of full titles, which could add nothing of im- portance to the full bibliographies already printed." 19 19. GWH, letter to DWF, 9 June 1893, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 7, CUL. Harris was cordial and deferent in echoing the unpretentious musings of his mentor, yet just a year later both Fiske and Harris would raise their sights and embark upon one of the most ambitious bibliographical projects up to that time, Dante-related or otherwise. "Meantime," Harris continued in the same reply to Fiske, "I have sent for two copies of the catalogue of the Dante works in the Harvard and Boston Libraries and will have it checked up and ready for you when you arrive." 20 20. GWH, letter to DWF, 9 June 1893. Fiske visited Cornell briefly in the late summer of 1893. In 1890, William Coolidge Lane, an acquisitions librarian at Harvard, had published an inventory of works by and about Dante held by the Harvard Col- lege and Boston Public libraries. As the title page of the volume announced, "for a large part of its Dante Collection Harvard College Library is indebted to Professor Charles Eliot Norton and the Dante Society." 21 21. William Coolidge Lane, The Dante Collections in the Harvard College and Boston Public Libraries , Bibliographical Contributions, no. 34 (Cambridge, MA: Issued by the Library of Harvard University, 1890), 116 pp. In addition to listing the Dante holdings of Harvard College Library and Boston Public Library, Lane includes titles from the personal collections of Charles Eliot Norton and the late George Ticknor. According to the Eighth Annual Report of the Dante Society , a copy of Lane's catalog was to be sent to each member of the society (see p. 11). Norton was one of the founders of the Dante Society, which had been established in Cambridge in 1881 "for the encouragement and promotion of the study of Dante's life and works" among the growing numbers of readers of Dante in the United States. 22 22. First Annual Report of the Dante Society, May 16, 1882 (Cambridge, MA: John Wilson and Son, University Press, 1882), p. 9. The report begins, "In December, 1880, a circular was issued proposing the formation of a society for the encouragement and promotion of the study of Dante's life and works, and inviting those who would be interested in the objects of the so- ciety to become members." The University of Michigan has a cataloged copy of the circular; see OCLC 67894346. The society provided its members with documentary studies and short articles about Dante in its annual reports, and furnished Harvard College Library with a rich array of Dante-related titles, which members of the society could request to borrow for personal study. Boston Public Library also held a number of volumes on Dante, several unique to its collection with respect to Harvard's. Additional copies and editions held in the personal libraries of Norton and George Ticknor, one of the earliest proponents of Dante in America and a founder of Boston Public Library, were likewise noted in Lane's catalog. 23 23. For a discussion of Ticknor's early role in disseminating knowledge of Dante in America, see Theodore Wesley Koch, Dante in America: A Historical and Bibliographical Study , reprinted from the Fifteenth Annual Report of the Dante Society (Boston: Ginn and Co., 1896), esp. 18–23. For more general discussions of Dante's American reception, see Angelina La Piana, Dante's American Pilgrimage: A Historical Survey of Dante Studies in the United States, 1800–1944 (New Haven: Published for Wellesley College by Yale University Press, 1948) and Kathleen Verduin, "Dante in America: The First Hundred Years," in Michele Moylan and Lane Stiles, eds., Reading Books: Essays on the Material Text and Literature in America (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1996), 16–51. Plans for the publication of the catalog were first announced in the Fourth Annual Report of the Dante Society in 1885, and its content began appearing that year in preliminary form in the Harvard University Bulletin and separately. 24 24.

In many subsequent annual reports of the society through 1916, Lane included a listing of additions to the Dante Col- lection in Harvard College Library that came through purchases funded by the Dante Society or direct donation. 25 25. See Annual Report of the Dante Society , vols. 6 (1887)–14 (1895), 16 (1897), 17 (1898), 23 (1904), 24 (1905), 27 (1908) and 35 (1916). He also published a comprehensive annual Dante bibliography in the Dante Society reports from 1887 until 1890, when the regular publication of a more thorough bibliography in the Bullettino of the Ital- ian Dante Society obviated the need to continue. 26 26. See note accompanying William Coolidge Lane, "Dante Bibliography for the Year 1889," in the Ninth Annual Report of the Dante Society (Cambridge, MA: John Wilson and Son, University Press, 1890), 21, and the Tenth Annual Report of the Dante Society (Cambridge, MA: John Wilson and Son, University Press, 1891), 12. Lane's catalogs and bibliographical supplements, in their various editions and additions, thus served not only as inventories of regional collections of Dante material but also as bibliographical guides to their subject. The main 1890 catalog was organized into several sections, reflecting a library classifica- tion scheme that Lane had developed based on models supplied by Italian Dante bibliographies. 27 27. See the Fourth Annual Report of the Dante Society (Cambridge, MA: John Wilson and Son, University Press, 1885), 10–11: "The books themselves are brought together under a running number, so that the whole collection may be moved bodily to any part of the library where it will be most conveniently situated. The system of numbering is simple, and will admit of an indefinite increase in the number of books without interfering with the plan of arrangement. The order in which the books stand on the shelf is, briefly: manuscripts; editions of the Divina Commedia or complete works, in strictly chronological order; selections; translations, English, French, German, Danish, Dutch, Greek, Italian dialects, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and other languages, under each language alphabetically by names of trans- lators (editions and translations of separate parts of the Divina Commedia are not distinguished from the complete poem); dictionaries of language; biographical dictionaries; rimari; miscella- neous comment and criticism on the Divina Commedia , divided by languages and alphabetically by authors under each language; minor works, arranged on the same plan as the editions of the Divina Commedia and its comments; biography of Dante and history of the times; several small miscellaneous divisions, such as parallel works, language of Dante, fiction, poems, portraits, statues, tomb, etc.; Dante societies; celebration of the sixth centennial bibliographies; histories of Dante literature; booksellers' catalogues; library catalogues; portfolios." The Italian models for the general organizational plan would have included the Bibliografia dantesca of Colomb de Batines, cited below (n. 30). In June 1893, Fiske wrote to Harris from Paris, where he was stopping to buy books on his way to London and then the United States: "I have purposely refrained from consulting Lane's (Harvard) lists until now, when I have had my copies of the main list (1890) and of one later (May 1892) sent on here. My secretary didn't succeed in finding the other." 28 28. DWF, letter to GWH, 19 June (1893), DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [220], CUL. Fiske's secretary was an able Italian named Ettore Sordi. Sordi's surviving account books from the Villa Landor (some of which are at Cornell University while others are at the Houghton Library at Harvard University) can be used to trace not only household expenses but certain bookseller and shipping receipts related to Fiske's Dante purchases. That Fiske started using Lane's catalog and one of his supplemental lists in the summer of 1893 indicates that his interest in acquiring Dante material had passed from casual to intentional and systematic. He used the listings both as a guide for what to seek out and purchase as well as means of recording of what he had found; he later mentions that he wore out several copies of Lane's catalog in this manner. 29 29. Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:v. See also DWF, post- card to GWH, 1 Feb (1894), DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [12], CUL, in which Fiske asks Harris to send him two clean copies of the Harvard catalog, presumably because the other he had was already too marked up or worn out. Fiske went on in this same letter, "I retain with me most of the bibliogr[aphy] books. I take it for granted that the Library has Colomb de Batines (1845–6) so I have bought only the Indice by Bacchi della lega (1883) and the supplement by Biagi (1883). The most useful Dante book I know of is Scartazzini's Dante Handbuch (1892)—bib- liographically as otherwise." 30 30. DWF, letter to GWH, 19 June (1893). The works that Fiske cites are: Paul Colomb de Batines, Bibliografia dantesca; ossia, Catalogo delle edizioni, traduzioni, codici manoscritti e comenti della Divina commedia e delle opere minori di Dante, seguito dalla serie de' biografi di lui. Traduzione italiana fatta sul manoscritto francese dell' autore (Prato: Tip. Aldina, 1845–1846 [i.e. 1845–1848]), 2 vols.; Alberto Bacchi della Lega, Indice generale della Bibliografia dantesca compilata dal Sig. visconte Colomb de Batines (Bologna: G. Romagnoli, 1883); Paul Colomb de Batines, Giunte e correzioni inedite alla Bibliografica dantesca, pubblicate di sul manoscritto originale della R. Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Firenze, dal dr. Guido Biagi (Firenze: G. C. Sansoni, 1888); and Giovanni Andrea Scartazzini, Dante-Handbuch: Einführung in das Studium des Lebens und der Schriften Dante Alighieri's (Leipzig: F. A. Brockhaus, 1892). In retrospect, Fiske should have bought Colomb de Batines's bibliography when he had the chance, as the Cornell Library in fact lacked the two-volume guide and it would be months before Fiske could find another set to make up the deficit. In this same letter, Fiske related more details about his means of pursuing Dante books and securing them for shipment to Cornell: "Galignani's Bookshop will send from here a small case of Dante books by the French steamer leaving next Saturday, June 24. It will be addressed c/o Tice + Lynch [a customs clear- ing agent]. Allen, I hope, will send another small case next week. I leave for London to-morrow." 31 31. DWF, letter to GWH, 19 June (1893). Edward G. Allen was an American agent in London who would search for foreign books upon request. Fiske used his services frequently in building his Dante collection, as London would prove to be the best market for supplying Dante material during those years. Fiske went on: "I trust that mail packages from Harrassowitz, Trübner (Strasbourg), Bare, Hoepli, Clausen (Turin), Loescher + Seeber, and from Geneva and Lausanne are coming in rapidly." 32 32. DWF, letter to GWH, 19 June (1893). This last line showed that Fiske was receiving and reviewing catalogs from booksellers all across Europe, having thrown the whole network of rela- tionships he had developed over many years into action to aid him in what was heating up to be a mad pursuit of anything published in any language at any time about Dante. By the time Fiske embarked on his Dante collecting, he had more than four decades of book-buying experience behind him, the last of which had been almost constantly devoted to the activity. He knew how to work intel- ligently and quickly, and at this point in his life, he had more cash at his disposal to apply to the objects of his collecting aims than ever before, thanks to the final settlement of the "Great Will Case." While one might expect that this last advantage would overrule all others, and lead Fiske to give free rein to his feverish ambitions, it did not. Fiske's long experience as a collector taught him much about the book market and the pricing of books, and he would rarely allow himself to purchase a volume at a price he considered exorbitant, no matter how much he may have desired the particular prize or how rare it might be. On the other hand, he was certainly motivated by what he considered bargains. For example, he wrote to Harris from London in that same June of 1893, "At Quaritch's I found, to my surprise, quite a stock of Dante. He was good enough to mark all the ordinary books down about 20 percent, so that I bought quite a number…. Quaritch likewise has a copy of the first edition of Dante (Foligno), but his price is stupendous, and I am reflecting on it. I think Harvard hasn't got it." 33 33. DWF, letter to GWH, 24 June (1893), DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [221], CUL. In this instance, Fiske did break with his tendency toward thrift and bought the editio princeps from Quaritch after some negotiation. One factor that may have motivated his decision is that the particular copy included extensive marginal an- notations attributed at the time to the fifteenth-century Italian poet Luca Pulci. 34 34. Fiske mentions the attribution to Pulci in a letter to Harris sent from Oxford, on his way back to the United States, on 17 July 1893 (DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [225]): "When you receive this you will probably be in Ithaca and I will probably in N.Y. I finished my Dante purchases here to-day, although many orders are still out, especially with Loescher, Allen and Harrassowitz. I bring with me four rare folios: 1) The editio princeps of the Div. Com (Foligno) 1472 by the printer Numeister. The copy has a host of inedited annota- tions by the poet Lucca [ sic ] Pulci, brother of the more famous poet Luigi Pulci, author of the Morgante Maggiore…." Luca Pulci, however, died in 1470, though the volume might have belonged to Luigi's son, who was born and named for him after his death, or perhaps even Luigi himself or another member of the Pulci family. Further research is needed to determine the precise provenance. The other three volumes that Fiske hand-carried to Cornell were the 1477 Venetian and 1487 Brescian editions of the Commedia and the rare first Spanish translation by Fernando de Villegas published in Burgos in 1515. Fiske delighted in acquiring volumes that he thought might hold special interest to scholars. Another factor might simply have been the fact that Harvard lacked a copy. Harris commented in a letter from the end of July, after Fiske had reported the purchase, "I hardly ventured to hope that you would add it to the collection after what you said about Quaritch's price. But you are evidently determined to give us the best Dante collection in the country. Crane is really overwhelmed by the extent of the collection." 35 35. GWH, letter to DWF, 29 July 1893, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 7, CUL. T. F. ("Teefy") Crane was Cornell's professor of Italian at the time, and a good friend of Fiske's. Did Harris's remark betray a hint of rivalry? Was Fiske out to out-do Harvard at one of its best bibliographical games? By all accounts, the Dante Society had been remarkably successful in achieving one of its chief aims, namely "establish- ing a library of Dantesque literature" for the benefit of its members and the university. 36 36. Dante Society, First Annual Report of the Dante Society, May 16, 1882 (Cambridge, MA: John Wilson and Son, University Press, 1882), 12. For an account of the formation of the Dante collection in Harvard College Library and its relationship to the Dante Society, see my forth- coming essay "Collecting and Reading Dante in America: Harvard College Library and the Dante Society," Harvard Library Bulletin 20:3 (Fall 2010). Could it have been that an otherwise mild-mannered Fiske saw an opportunity to assert his collecting might and bibliographical prowess on a stage where it would finally get noticed? Hardly anyone in America was interested in Petrarch at the time, much less his Icelandic or Rhaeto-Romance material, while Dante, on the other hand, was becoming increasingly popular and widely read, as evidenced by the number of publishers who issued both cheap and more upscale editions of Henry Francis Cary's blank-verse translation of the Commedia paired with Gustave Doré's sensational Gothic engravings, not to mention the success that Longfellow's translation had enjoyed, at least initially. Or could it have been that Fiske wanted to prove to his rivals in the "Great Will Case"— Sage and Boardman—that it was he who cared the most about Jennie McGraw's intentions to provide support for Cornell's library? Is that why he began directing the yields from his Dante collecting immediately to the shelves of the new library that Sage had built for the university in memory of Jennie, instead of retaining those precious volumes for his own enjoyment in Florence, as he did with his beloved Petrarch and Icelandic collections? Although competition was a primary motivator for other collectors, it seems less likely an explanation in Fiske's case. For Fiske, competing in an intellectual game like chess was one thing, but it was against his complacent nature to engage in competition on a personal, emotional level. By all contemporary reports, and from what one can surmise of his character by reading his letters, he likewise shunned situations that could provoke conflict, except when some moral cause was at stake. Fiske's behavior in the affair of his wife's estate epitomized this trait: he became indignant when he learned that the Cornell trustees had been with- holding information from him, but then removed himself from the immediacy of the resulting strife by resigning his posts and transferring his domicile across the ocean. More probably, Fiske's Dante collecting was prompted by his gradual recognition of Dante's centrality to Italian literature, his prime importance on the scale of literary authors from all nationalities and ages, and the sheer mass of literature that called out for expert bibliographers to master. In his "Introductory" to the eventual collection catalog, Fiske confessed that he initially approached Dante through the lens of Petrarch, which is to say as an important predecessor to the latter. 37 37. Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:v. Yet he also remarked that his residence in Italy brought him daily reminders of the greatness of the first of the tre corone . 38 38. Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:iii. Dante's fame in Italy, especially in Florence, was never greater than in 1865, the sixth centenary of his birth, which came at a time when liberal-minded Italians were trying to form a unified political entity from the fractured kingdoms on their shared peninsula. Dante and his literary genius emerged as a potent symbol around which the proponents of the Risorgimento could rally and establish a na- tion, an achievement that came finally in 1870 with the annexation of Rome dur- ing the Franco-Prussian War. 39 39. For a recent study of the phenomenon of Dante as a cultural icon enmeshed in the discourse around the unification of Italy, see Andrea Ciccarelli, "Dante and the Culture of Risorgimento: Literary, Political or Ideological Icon?" in Albert Russell Ascoli and Krystyna Von Henneberg, eds. Making and Remaking Italy: The Cultivation of National Identity around the Risorgimento (Oxford: Berg, 2001), 77–102. Post unification, the Dante standard was usurped by a resurgent Catholic right. 40 40. For a broad discussion of the "Catholic recovery" after the annexation of Rome and the papal states, though absent any mention of Dante, see John Pollard, Catholicism in Modern Italy: Religion, Society and Politics since 1861 (London and New York: Routledge, 2008). Leading clergy, such as Dante commentator Gia- como Poletto, and even Pope Leo XIII, who appointed Poletto to a special chair in Dante studies in his newly established college of St. Apollinare, found in the Commedia a providential confluence of the streams of scholastic theology. 41 41. See Dupont, "Collecting Dante in America at the End of the Nineteenth Century: John Zahm and Notre Dame," 450–451, and also Paola Romagnoni and Lino Capovilla, Giacomo Poletto: dantista e poeta (Rubano, Italy: Gregoriana Libreria Editrice, 1996). It was this latter current that swept up Zahm while he served as procurator general for his religious order in Rome and convinced him that his aspirations for making Notre Dame a great Catholic university could be manifestly advanced by creating for its library a great collection of works by and about the great Catholic poet. 42 42. Dupont, "Collecting Dante in America at the End of the Nineteenth Century: John Zahm and Notre Dame," 479–480. Fiske, on the other hand, does not appear to have been impelled either by an ideological purpose, like Zahm, or even by an immediately academic one, as in the case of Harvard. Instead, it seems that, true to his word, Fiske's interest in Dante was awakened by passive observation. He could not have failed to notice the various public monuments and works of art dedicated to Dante that appeared in Italy during the latter part of the nineteenth century, culminating in the tow- ering statue erected in Trent in 1896. Symbolizing the irredentist movement that sought to recover the city and the Italian-speaking portion of the Tyrolean province from the Austrian empire, sculptor Cesare Zocchi portrayed Dante as an exalted figure, standing with his arm stretched out in seeming defiance toward the Alps and the German-speaking lands to the north. 43 43. Of particular note in the Fiske Dante Collection at CUL, there is among a series of four oversize boxes labeled "Dante Portfolio," a "Dante Photograph Album" that contains sev- eral contemporary photographic prints of the dedication of the monument to Dante at Trent. Another factor contributing to his awareness was likely the reappearance of Dante material on the antiquarian market following its release from the generation of collectors who had grabbed it up during the height of Dante's popularity around celebrations of the sixth centenary of his birth in 1865. 44 44. Fiske, in his "Introductory" to his Dante collection catalog, cites this factor among other "favoring circumstances" that he credits for enabling him to assemble so large a collection so quickly: "The interest awakened by the celebration in 1865 of the sixth centenary of Dante's birth led to the formation of various private Dante collections, and to liberal purchases of Dante books by public libraries. Since those festivities a quarter of a century had now gone by, and ardent hunters after Dante book-treasures were few. As a consequence the shelves devoted to Dante in the antiquarian book-shops were again full" (Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:xvii). Surely the simple and easy availability of Dante-related works must have stimulated Fiske's collecting appetite. Granting that possibility, the menu consisted of more courses than he might have imagined. In July 1893, Harris wrote to Fiske: "As the books arrive they are checked on a copy of the Harvard list (1890), and slips are made for any not in that list, and the number of these is surprisingly large." 45 45. GWH, letter to DWF, 6 July 1893, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 7, CUL. This is when the "charm of the chase," as Fiske would later describe it, 46 46. See Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:iv, where Fiske de- scribes, almost poetically, his zealous pursuit of Dante: "… my ambition shortly took a broader range; the charm of the chase got possession of me, and it was impossible to escape from its grasp. For the book-collector, like the gambler and the miser, is the slave of his passion. With the former he feels that, at any moment, luck may place in his hands a great prize; why should his search slacken until that happy moment arrives? When it does come he is quite as eager for another stroke of good fortune, and quite as willing to wait and work for it. And again, as with the miser, it gratifies him to see his treasures accumulating—to know that to-day he is richer by a score of volumes than yesterday; and in my case the books I was looking for turned up with a readiness which surprised me, and, in general, at prices which made hesitation unnecessary. Why should I withdraw too hastily from a sport so full of zest? My gift of such a considerable collection to Cornell University was thus really the result of my unwillingness to refrain from a delectable self-indulgence, or, in other words, of my inability to evade temptation and free myself from the enthralling spell of bibliomania. This robs the giver of any special credit, and renders gratitude unmeet. One might as well laud—or thank—the prodigal spendthrift for the sums he expends on his rounds of dissipation." got a hold of him, and when he determined to assemble as comprehensive a collection of Dante material as possible—not out of some prideful need to compete with Harvard, much less bolster a partisan ambition, but because he was coming to recognize that none of the Dante bibliographies he was working with, no matter how recent, adequately represented the enormous literature that existed and continued to flourish. Ulti- mately, the main reason that Fiske became passionate about Dante collecting was so that he could contribute to the advancement of Dante bibliography. In this light, what one might find surprising, as Fiske himself probably did in retrospect, is that he showed signs of thinking he was nearing completion of his collecting task by the early part of 1894, less than a year after he began. In a letter dated 13 February 1894, Fiske included a drawing of a book label that he proposed to Harris to identify the Dante books he had been giving to the Cornell library. 47 47. DWF, letter to GWH 13 Feb 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [225], CUL. Interestingly, he used the Italian phrase "Biblioteca Dantesca," mean- ing "Dante library," rather than "raccolta" or "collezione," which would have been the more natural linguistic choices, especially given that his collection was to be incorporated into the university's library. 48 48. For example, he surely saw the catalogs of Dante material that were offered by the Florentine antiquarian bookseller in Libreria Eredi Grazzini (G. Dotti), who respectively titled numbers 6 (1893) and 9 (1894) of his seventh catalog series "Raccolta dantesca" and "100 articoli per la raccolta dantesca." On the other hand, Fiske might have been inspired by earlier antiquarian catalogs issued by Ermanno Loescher (catalog 76; Turin, 1887) and Ulrico Hoepli (catalogs 12 and 52; Milan, 1883 and 1888) which were all titled "Biblioteca dantesca." Nev- ertheless, for Dante collections housed within larger libraries, the use of "raccolta" or "collezi- one" is preferred, as demonstrated, for instance, by the case of Evan Mackenzie, who published a catalog of his personal Dante holdings under the title La raccolta dantesca della biblioteca Evan Mackenzie (Genoa: Tip. del Risparmio, 1923) and then later donated them to the municipal library in Genoa, where they were combined with the library's own and another Dante col- lection, and subsequently described in a comprehensive catalog titled La collezione dantesca della biblioteca civica Berio di Genova (Florence: Olschki, 1966). The choice of wording suggested that Fiske was striving for and thought he would soon achieve a certain complete- ness with respect to the physical gathering of the editions of Dante works that were known then to him to exist. Also noteworthy in this same regard was his inclusion of a date span on the label, 1893–1894, as if to announce that he would have completed the collection, or library, by the end of the year. The second page of the letter included another sketch showing how Fiske intended the label to be placed on the upper-left corner of the inside cover of the Dante volumes in conjunction with his standard "W. F." bookplate, to be pasted in the center. Although the labels were made up and the placement scheme followed for awhile, it was eventually abandoned, and a full-scale bookplate was created for the Dante collection—still called, and more properly so, a "Biblioteca Dantesca"—with the "W. F." initials spread across the pages of an open book surrounded by a floriated border in a manner that complemented the design of the bookplates for his Icelandic and Petrarch collections. The date span was dropped but the word "bequest" was added, perhaps signaling Fiske's intention to fund an endowment for future acquisitions through his estate, which he in fact did. Indeed, he ulti- mately left more to Cornell for "the use and purposes of the Library" than he was apportioned through the settlement of the will suit. 49 49. According to Horatio S. White, Willard Fiske, Life and Correspondence , 222, "The total amount received by Professor Fiske a result of the will suit, after the various expenses of the undertaking had been met, was something under $400,000. The amount which the University received from his estate was not far from $600,000." For details on the yield and usage of the library endowment established by Fiske, see Bishop, A History of Cornell , 356–357. Further evidence that Fiske thought he was getting close to completing his col- lecting of Dante in 1894 may be discerned in the summary lists that he included in some of his letters. For example, while book-hunting in Rome in March, he appended to one of his letters to Harris a list of the Renaissance editions of the Commedia that he had acquired, which, in fact, included all except for certain extremely rare incunabula and two reprint editions that he was not sure whether he had secured and wanted Harris to verify (see figure 2). 50 50. DWF, letter to GWH, 8 March 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [21], CUL. The rare incunabula that Fiske lacked were, by order of their issue, the second (Mantua, 1472), third (Jesi, 1472), fourth (Naples, [1473?]), fifth (Naples, 1477) and eighth (Venice, 1478). The sixteenth-century reprints about which Fiske was uncertain at the time were the 1551 Lyonnaise and the 1578 Venetian editions. After receiving the list, Harris added in pencil the classification numbers he assigned to each volume according to his unique orga- nizational scheme. Another such list appeared in a letter to Harris from May 1894 (see figure 3): "I copy from my Harv. Cat. the numbered titles lacking…. Do you find any oth- ers on your copy of the Cat. that are still wanting?" 51 51. DWF, letter to GWH, 30 May 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [39], CUL. There were about seventy- five titles from Lane's catalog that Fiske had by that point not yet secured—these in proportion to the 1,381 titles Harvard claimed to own by 1892 and the more than 1,250 titles that Harris in a letter from 3 March had reported were among the Fiske Dante library but not recorded by Lane. No wonder Fiske must have thought that he was nearing the end of his collecting labors: there were com- paratively few volumes left to chase down, at least according to the standard of the Harvard Catalog, which Fiske had by then far outstripped. Around this time, Harris placed the running volume tally for the collection at 2,865, slightly more than double the last published count of Harvard's collection, which stood at 1,381 (in fairness, however, Harvard's collection continued to grow, and dif- ferences in the ways pamphlets were counted skewed the respective tallies). 52 52. DWF, letter to GWH, 27 March 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [27], CUL. Around this time, we find Harris and Fiske reconsidering the matter of the collection catalog. They had previously settled on the notion of publishing merely a simple two-line title listing since, according to their own reasoning, other bib- liographies could be consulted for imprint and other information. At the end of April 1894, however, Harris wrote to Fiske: "The collection has now grown so large that it almost seems to deserve to have something better than a brief title finding list.

Catalogue? Or would you prefer to have the catalogue of the Cornell Collec- tion entirely independent?" 53 53. GWH, letter to DWF, 27 April 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 8, CUL. Fiske replied, "I think it will be better to try + do something better than a short title catalog—including perhaps careful cor- rections of all preceding Dante bibliographies + a very complete list of Dante bibliographical works. I can furnish some considerable matter, as for instance, a pretty complete list of Polish books + articles on Dante, + c And I might give dates of death of Dante writers, whose lives have not reached the biographical lexicon + encyclopedia. Perhaps I can compile a list of books + articles not yet in the collection to serve as an appendix. But all this depends on my health." 54 54. DWF, card to GWH, 9 May 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [33], CUL. Fiske was suffering from a heart and circulatory ailment that caused his over- all condition to deteriorate over the next several months, gradually limiting and restricting his collecting activities under doctor's orders. In late October he wrote to Harris, "I have been waiting here in the hope that my heart's action would grow a little stronger so that I might venture across the ocean. For six weeks now my Italian servant and myself have been living alone in a quiet street following out the directions given me carefully—walking so much, at just such a time, dieting strictly etc…. I am told too that I musn't for the present buy any more Dante books—and even not to write or read over half an hour a day. Think what a year I am to have." 55 55. DWF, letter to GWH, 18 October 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [51], CUL. As 1894 neared its end, Fiske was worn out from his Dante collecting but was anxious to pursue it further. He had come to realize that the material to be sought out was much greater than he had anticipated when the year started, especially since in the course of it he had expanded the scope of his collection to include all of foreign translations of Dante and Dante criticism in every lan- guage. To continue, and especially to produce a catalog, he would need consid- erable help. Already by March of 1894, not quite a year after Fiske had begun earnest work on the collection, the American newspaper in Florence carried a story about it that was picked up on the other side of the Atlantic. 56 56. Florence Gazette , 24 March 1894: "… This Dantesque collection is the finest existing out of Italy, and will serve to diffuse the study of the Italian language [on] the other side of the Ocean. It consists of 3000 volumes…. Cornell University, as our readers are doubless [ sic ] aware, is one of the wealthiest of the schools of the America [ sic ] and has 1800 students and 125 professors. Professor Fiske possesses a superb Petrarch Library and collection of Icelandic books here in Florence, which are the admiration of all who have had the fortune to examine them." The May issue of Cornell Magazine from the same year offered an overview of the collection by T. F. Crane. 57 57. Thomas Frederick Crane, "The Dante Library Presented by Willard Fiske to Cornell University," reprinted from Cornell Magazine , May 1894 (Ithaca, NY: n. p., 1894). These stories, or perhaps reports of them in academic circles, must have caught the attention of Theodore Koch, a recent Harvard graduate who had studied Dante under Charles Eliot Norton and who was busy at the time compiling, under the supervision of William Lane, a bibliography of all works on Dante that had been published in America. 58 58. Theodore Wesley Koch, Dante in America: A Historical and Bibliographical Study , re- printed from the Fifteenth Annual Report of the Dante Society (Boston: Ginn and Company, 1896). During the fall of 1895, Koch trav- eled to Cornell to see what further references he might find for his bibliography in the Fiske Dante Library. In a letter to Arthur Richmond Marsh, the secretary of the Dante Society in Cambridge who was waiting to publish Koch's work in a future volume of the Society's annual reports, Koch related his impressions of the collection. "It is very rich along certain lines, early editions of Dante, translations and out-of-the-way Danteiana," he admitted, but quickly turned to criticize its deficiencies: "I have pointed out to Mr. Harris, the librarian, the omissions in my own special fields of bibliographical interest, American Danteiana, and what has been called the iconography of the D.C. [i.e., Divine Comedy ], as well as in the matter of Dante portraits." 59 59. Theodore Wesley Koch, letter to Alfred Richmond Marsh, 1 October 1895. Dante Society of America Records , MS Am 1794 (140), Houghton Library, Harvard University. He also went a step further and lamented the manner used to arrange and describe the materials, citing, among other faults, the neglect of related material in periodicals and other literature beyond those volumes donated by Fiske. "I wish I could convince the staff of the inadequacy of their method of cataloging the collection," he continued. "As I am to meet Mr. Fiske this week I may try my powers of persuasion on him. I prove my point (to my satisfaction at least) by taking the two sonnets of Michael Angelo on Dante, mentioned in their card catalogue, and making out a list of translations into English, French, German and Spanish. I find but five references in their catalogue, while there are as many as eighteen translations that ought to be in their list; every one is in the Cornell Library, some it is true are not on the Dante shelves, but I trust they are not going to forget the needs of the student so much as to issue a mere catalogue of the books brought together by Mr. Fiske." 60 60. Koch to Marsh, 1 October 1895. Earlier that year, Koch received a letter from Henry Charles Lea (2 June 1895, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook II [176–177], CUL) in which Lea enclosed a copy of his translation of Michelangelo's sonnet on Dante and encouraged Koch to publish by subscription his proposed volume of Italian sonnets in English verse—a project which Koch was evidently never able to make time for between the comple- tion of his American Dante bibliography and the engrossing work of cataloging the Fiske Dante collection, which he was soon to undertake. With these words, Koch inscribed his destiny and the future of one of the century's greatest bibliographical projects. Koch did have the opportunity to meet Fiske (who, having recovered a measure of health and stamina, was mak- ing a short visit to New York at the time) and did persuade him that he needed more expert help to catalog his Dante collection (in truth, Fiske had already been aware of the limitations of Harris's regular cataloging assistants 61 61. See, for example, GWH, letter to DWF, 25 May 1894, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 8, CUL, in which Harris mentions the concerns that Gertrude F. Van Dusen, the cataloger whom he had assigned to the project, had voiced to him about her ability to prepare bibliographical annotations to Fiske's satisfaction due to her lack of knowledge of the subject. Fiske instructed her through his letters to Harris (see, for example, DWF, letter to GWH, [18 January 1895], DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [65], CUL, in which Fiske responds to a series of questions about how to prepare entries, making frequent reference to Lane's catalog). With this training, she achieved some proficiency, but left Cornell to marry in February 1895, after which another cataloger, Alexey V. Babine, was assigned to devote some time to the task when he was not otherwise occupied with the cataloging of A. D. White's library (see GWH, letter to DWF, 26 April 1895, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 9, CUL). Thus, there was a definite need to fill when Koch decided to offer his services. ), and further- more convinced the collector to hire him to do the job himself. Producing a letter of introduction and recommendation from Charles Eliot Norton, Koch negoti- ated a salary of $125 per month, about the equivalent of a full librarian's salary. 62 62. See Theodore Wesley Koch (heareafter TWK), letter to GWH, 21 October 1895, Cor- nell University Library Records, 1868–1947 13/1/17, Box 5, CUL, and Charles Eliot Norton, letter to GWH, 5 October 1895, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 9, CUL. Fiske agreed to pay half, and Harris paid the remainder from his library budget. 63 63. Koch's salary payments are discussed in several letters; see for example GWH to DWF, 20 May 1896, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 10, CUL, which explicitly mentions that half of his salary was paid through monies provided by Fiske. In addition to a good salary, Koch, on the basis of his expert bibliographical knowledge of the subject, also negotiated the unprecedented privilege at Cornell of having his name appear on the title page of the printed catalog that would issue from the collaborative and cumulative effort. 64 64. See TWK, letter to GWH, 3 November 1895, Cornell University Library Records, 1868–1947 13/1/17, Box 5, CUL: "There is one other point about which we have not yet spo- ken. I have noticed that most of the Cornell catalogues are published anonymously. I must ask that an exception be made in this case, owing to the bibliographical nature of the work. I can hardly be expected to give up for a mere salary the notes and general information to acquire which I have striven so hard for so many months." Koch probably hoped to establish his reputation and future career as a librarian on the basis of his experi- ence at Cornell. If so, his bid paid off well: within a decade, at the youthful age of thirty-four, he would advance to the post of chief librarian at the University of Michigan. 65 65. In 1915, Koch resigned under pressure following a dispute with the Board of Regents. He then went on to serve as chief of the ordering division at the Library of Congress and later as head librarian at Northwestern University. Michigan and Northwestern hold the bulk of his personal papers. Koch initially estimated that completing a Dante catalog for Cornell along the lines he proposed would require the remainder of the academic year 1895- 1896, or about six months from his date of hire in December 1895. 66 66. See TWK, letter to GWH, 3 November 1895, cited above. In fact, it would take about four years to carry the last entries to press. The continual delays became a matter of much consternation and some embarrassment to Har- ris, who had to appeal on several occasions both to Fiske and Cornell's board of trustees to extend Koch's salary. Koch excused himself by explaining that the project had grown both in size and scope. Fiske continued to buy and ship more volumes, and Koch, on Fiske's authority, filled certain gaps by placing orders of his own and even directed the sale of duplicates to supply additional funds for binding. 67 67. The sale of duplicates is mentioned in several exchanges between Fiske, Harris and Koch, such as TWK, letter to DWF, 2 April 1896, DWF Papers 13/1/348, Box 9, CUL, and DWF, letter to GWH, 5 May 1896, DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook IV [88], CUL. Many duplicates were sold to Harvard, and some to other libraries. Concerning the transfer and sale of duplicates to Harvard, see especially the letter of TWK to Alfred Richmond Marsh, 10 December 1895, Dante Society of America Records , MS Am 1794 (141), Houghton Library, Harvard University. Koch also reshaped the project to include reviews of books and periodical literature on Dante, thus making the catalog in some respects more of a comprehensive bibliographical guide to Dante literature than the inventory of a single collection. 68 68. In his preface to the collection catalog, Koch writes, "… the combined entry of book and periodical literature in one list entails no great difficulties and enables one to give the ge- nealogy of many books, by recording articles of which they are the outgrowth and referring in turn to the reviews and articles occasioned by them. The method here outlined, impracticable for any but special lists, makes the present work more of a bibliography than a catalogue of a special collection" (Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:ii). Koch closely modeled his catalog upon Lane's, both in terms of the biblio- graphical elements contained in the entries and their typographical presenta- tions. Indeed, setting a page from each catalog side-by-side, it would be difficult to tell the difference a first glance, especially since the same printer, John Wilson FIGURE 4. Comparison of the entries for the 1515 Aldine edition of the Divina Commedia from William Coolidge Lane, The Dante Collections in the Harvard College and Boston Public Librar- ies (Cambridge, MA: Issued by the Library of Harvard University, 1890), 5 (on the left), and Theodore Wesley Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 2 vols.

Courtesy of the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library. and Son, who operated the University Press at Harvard, executed both works. Yet upon closer inspection, certain improvements in the Cornell catalog come to light. First, errors were corrected: the 1515 Aldine, for instance, is no longer described as a reprint of the undated Paganino edition, as the Harvard catalog had suggested. Next, the Cornell catalog generally included more detailed bib- liographical information as well as citations pertaining to the edition from other sources. Also, the entries in the Cornell catalog were organized and identified by date, rather than by ordinal series numbering, making it easier to find par- ticular works. Of course, the more obvious difference between the two catalogs was their extent. The Harvard and Boston Public Library catalog contained ap- proximately 1,400 entries in 116 pages; the Cornell catalog, some 7,000 entries in 606 pages divided between two large and heavy tomes, which appeared respec- tively in 1898 and 1900. Koch also went on to publish a supplemental bibliog- raphy of Dante titles and articles that he had identified in the catalogs of other American libraries in the course of his researches for Fiske. 69 69. Theodore Wesley Koch, A List of Danteiana in American Libraries: Supplementing the Cata- logue of the Cornell Collection (Boston: Ginn and Co., for the Dante Society, 1901). In the preface, Koch explains, "The great extent of the Fiske Collection makes its catalogue approach so near the limits of a reasonably exhaustive bibliography that I have deemed it advisable to bring it still nearer completeness by printing the majority of these titles. For practical purposes I shall divide them into two lists: (1) one comprising those found in American collections, and (2) an- other taking up those found in European libraries. The first is here printed with one deviation from its rule: for the sake of English students, references are included to books in the British Museum when they are also found in some American library. In a later Report of the Dante Society I hope to print the second of these lists, under the title of an 'Additional list of Dan- teiana supplementing the Cornell Collection; being titles gleaned from European libraries.'" Koch never managed, however, to fulfill this final aspiration. Yet what was the perceived impact of such a colossal collection, let alone its massive apparatus? Already in 1897, an article in the London Bookman observed: The Dante collection in Harvard University Library, formed by the union of the collec- tions in Harvard and those of the Dante Society, was for many years the most complete in that field in this country. It is interesting to observe how easily and how quickly this collection has been outstripped by the Fiske collection at Cornell. It is an instructive ex- ample of how American energy, coupled with literary taste and money, is able to achieve results in library development. 70 70. Unsigned article by George H. Baker, The Bookman , February 1897, excerpted in the Cornell Daily Sun , 29 January 1897; copies of both articles are found in DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook III [21], CUL. Meanwhile, a less flattering interpretation of this notice appeared in the pages of the New York World under the heading "We are Doers": According to a current item an American library has just been 'presented with over 5,000 works on Dante.' Fortunately, however, no one will read them, and all the harm they will do is in taking up shelf room that might otherwise be devoted to something useful…. Those 5,000 works on Dante are what ruined modern Italian literature. They filled Italy with virtuosos, cognoscenti, dilettanti and other superior people who know too much ever to do anything at all. That is not our fault in America. Whether we do well or ill, we do something, and quite frequently it is the very best we know how to do. 71 71. Unsigned article in The World (New York), 28 February 1897; a copy of the clipping may be found in DWF Papers 13/1/1165, Dante Scrapbook III [21], CUL. The argument is as surprising as it is inelegant, but it appears that Koch, who conscientiously pasted these clippings into the series of scrapbooks he had begun assembling to document the formation of the Fiske Dante Collection, was not merely amused but also somewhat disturbed by the imputed futility of his long labors. In an essay for Cornell Magazine titled "The Growth and Importance of the Cornell Dante Collection," Koch directly confronted the inference underlying such criticism. "Some students of Dante," he wrote, have felt that the presence of a large collection of books on the subject was a check on investigation (or at least on the publication of their own views about this or that matter) and so defeated its own ends. 'One sometimes ask one's self, in moments of despondency,' says Mr. Irving Babbitt in the Atlantic Monthly for March 1897, 'whether the main achieve- ment of the nineteenth century will not have been to accumulate a mass of machinery that will break the twentieth century's back…. Merely to master the special apparatus for the study of Dante and his times, the student, if he conforms to the standard set for the modern specialist, will run the risk of losing his intellectual symmetry and sense of proportion, precisely the qualities of which he will stand most in need for the higher interpretation of Dante.' 72 72. Theodore Wesley Koch, The Growth and Importance of the Cornell Dante Collection , re- printed from Cornell Magazine , June 1900 (Ithaca, NY: n. p., 1900), 5. Koch went on, acknowledging that, Many of the books in the Fiske Collection have undoubtedly had their day, and having served their purpose, great or humble as it may have been, are now of value only as records of the methods of interpreting Dante to previous generations. Other items in abundance are but bibliographical curiosities, serving only to elucidate the literary his- tory of some expounder of Dante, or the fortune of Dante's own works in the world of type and paper. 73 73. Koch, Growth and Importance of the Cornell Dante Collection , 6. He then concluded: The truth is that the great library is a source of joy or of despair according as to how the investigator is disposed toward his work. If he is a man of vitality and discriminating powers he will not be daunted by the presence of the proportionately large part of the literature of his subject which he never hopes or wants to look into; he will know how to choose his reading and will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff without thresh- ing the whole stack. 74 74. Koch, Growth and Importance of the Cornell Dante Collection , 6–7. Certainly Fiske knew how to sift and sort through an abundant accumulation of sources, and how to help others appreciate and learn the needed skills. In the "Introductory" he provided Koch for the catalog of his Dante collection, Fiske devoted the last two-thirds of the sixteen-page essay to a species of bibliographi- cal analysis that approached what modern library and information science has termed "bibliometrics." 75 75. For a survey of the history of bibliometrics, as well as definitions of the term and techniques, together with a bibliography on the subject, see Farideh Osareh, "Bibliometrics, Citation Analysis and Co-Citation Analysis: A Review of Literature I," Libri 46 (September 1996), 149–158. For example, he observed: "Worldwide fame— la fama mondiale —is decided by a man's standing outside of his own country, or what in the case of the writer, is the same thing, beyond the limits of his own speech. Renderings of his productions measure the breadth of his renown. Only one lan- guage, so far as I know, possessing translations of the Iliad and Odyssey, is with- out a complete translation of the Divine Comedy." 76 76. Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:vii. According to Fiske, the only language that lacked a translation of the Divine Comedy that had produced one of Homer was Icelandic. Given his dual collecting passions, Fiske no doubt sensed the irony of his observation. He likewise invoked other statistical measures that were enabled only by the compilation of the collection catalog: "If we make use of another test we shall learn that, since the year 1800, the average annual number of editions of the Divine Comedy, in the original, has been considerably more than four. Can the century now passing show four hundred and forty editions, let us say, of the English Shakespeare?" 77 77. Koch, Catalogue of the Dante Collection Presented by Willard Fiske , 1:ix. The passionate collector was just as passionate a bibliographer, and it was the combination of these two passions together with a third, namely sharing his knowledge with interested readers, that made him also a passionate librarian—a profession with which it seems Fiske continued to identify himself even after he had exchanged the campus on the hillsides of Ithaca for his villas on the hillsides of Tuscany. The story of the Fiske Dante Library at Cornell indeed illustrates how serious book collecting, bibliography and librarianship go hand in hand. The collector relies on bibliographies as an explorer relies on maps, and to the extent that maps may indicate uncharted territories, the collector provides the coordinate data necessary to sketch in their features. The librarian meanwhile, like a good first mate, oversees the deck crew and ensures that ship's cargo is brought safely to port. Charting the course as captain, Fiske displayed his talents in each role as he skillfully led his book-collecting voyage and coordinated the duties performed by Harris and Koch in organizing and cataloging their prizes. In the end, they jointly succeeded in mastering a huge tract of bibliographical ocean, sounding the very depths of Dantean literature from both sides of the Atlantic. 78 78. For a humorous aside that makes use of this same navigational metaphor, see Edwin Roffe, Frisket Fancies, Set Forth for Bibliomanics! (London: Rochester Press, 1861), a privately printed edition in twelve copies whose chapter titled "Bibliomaniac Babblings!" includes the following folly: "Oh! Ye Immortal Gods! the Rueful Hackings ye Doom us to, when, transform- ing Men into Wretched Bibliomaniacs, ye then leave them to Flounder about in the Trackless Sahara of SCARCE BOOKS! OH! with what Fiendishness ye cast us forth to encounter 'the rage and wallowing waves of the Sea,'—the Bibliographical Ocean!" BOOK-JACKETS OF THE 1890s by G. Thomas Tanselle The adoption of book-jackets by publishers in the English-speaking world has produced what may be the most striking and durable change in the appearance of their books since the introduction of cloth edition-casings in the 1820s. 1 1. Indeed, the precursor of the jacket—the printed wrapping that enclosed the book completely—originated at about the same time that publishers' cloth bindings were first used, and no doubt in response to them. Jackets with flaps were being used sporadically (or so it seems) by the 1850s. For about forty years I have been interested in documenting the growth in the use of book-jackets (and other detachable coverings of books) by publish- ers and have made notes on every pre-1901 example that came to my attention. I gave an initial report in The Library in 1971, to which I appended a list of 262 pre-1901 examples. 2 2. "Book-Jackets, Blurbs, and Bibliographers," The Library , 5th ser., 26 (1971), 91–134. Thirty-five years later, in volume 56 of Studies in Bibliogra- phy , I published a much fuller history of the book-jacket down to the present, surveyed the attention that had been paid to jackets since 1971, reviewed their uses as historical evidence, and offered a list of 380 examples of pre-1891 jackets (superseding my earlier list for the years through 1890). 3 3. "Dust-Jackets, Dealers, and Documentation," Studies in Bibliography , 56 (for 2003–4; published 2006), 45–140. Now I am presenting a new list for the decade of the 1890s (1891 through 1900), amounting to 1,156 entries, prefaced by a brief account of recent book-jacket news and a summary of some of the information revealed by the 1890s list. I One of the concerns taken up in my recent article was the far too common practice among dealers of moving jackets from one copy of a book to another; and I commented on the discussions occasioned by the 2004 report of a subcom- mittee of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association that criticized the practice and insisted on dealers' noting any discrepancy in condition between a book and its jacket (and identifying switched jackets when possible). A few months after the London book-jacket conference for which my article was written, Nicolas Barker published an admirable leader entitled "Sophistication" in the Spring 2006 num- ber of The Book Collector (55: 11–27). Recognizing that certain alterations to a book can sometimes be countenanced if conservation is necessary for the book's survival, he was appropriately firm in declaring other intrusions, aimed at "res- toration," to be unjustifiable tampering with historic artifacts—the "crime of distorting historic fact" (p. 17). One of his examples dealt with remboîtage (insertion of a book's text block into a different binding) and the other with the supplying of jackets. Even when dealers disclose what has been done, these practices are indefensible: as Barker says, " Remboîtage is wrong, and doubly wrong if the fact is suppressed" (p.15). 4 4. Graham Chainey, in a letter to the Times Literary Supplement on 8 June 2007 ("Dust- wrapped," p. 17), also makes the point that the disclosure of tampering does not make it right. Citing a Gekoski catalogue in which two inscribed copies are listed in "supplied" jackets, Chainey says, "This swapping about of dustwrappers, I feel, erodes the authenticity of historical objects." At the high prices asked, he adds, "one might expect a greater respect for the integrity of the goods offered." In the matter of jackets, he called for the national organizations that make up the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers to adopt more explicit codes of ethics, with provisions for sanctions to enforce them. To begin the process, he offered his own Ten Commandments regarding jackets. The two central ones, from which all else follows, are the first and fourth: "Thou shalt not have any jacket but the original jacket"; "Remember that thou keep absolute the integrity of jacket and book. Upon it thou shalt do no manner of change or exchange…." Indeed, "no manner of change or exchange" is an elegant summary of the position, for it covers both switching jackets and touching them up. Barker's commandments should be memorized and held inviolable by all dealers and collectors. That this hope is vain was reflected in a depressing article that appeared a year later in the May/June 2007 issue (No. 27) of Fine Books &amp; Collections . Written by the magazine's editor, P. Scott Brown, and ominously entitled "The Anatomy of Dust Jacket Restoration" (pp. 40–45), it makes clear what a lucrative business jacket restorers have, for the demand from prominent dealers exceeds the supply of "expert" restorers. The practice of sophisticated (so to speak) jacket restora- tion apparently began in the mid-1970s when Peter Howard (Serendipity Books, Berkeley) proposed the idea to John Pofelski, whose job in the R. R. Donnelley binding department was about to end, along with the department itself. Now there is a small group of such specialists, whose work has affected thousands of jackets in the stocks of dealers and the holdings of collectors and libraries. Some dealers are willing to invest in such restoration in order, obviously, "to make more money" (in Howard's words). Brown even says, with a curious logic, "The jacket restoration trend has had the beneficial effect of bringing a lot of books into circulation that would not have been salable or collectable" (p. 45). The only reason that books in restored (or switched) jackets are "salable" at high prices is that there is considerable demand for them on the part of collectors—which in turn means that there are many collectors who need to be educated in the matter of historic preservation. One of the finest traditions of the book world is the role that dealers have played as the teachers of collectors. But in this matter, a few prominent dealers have forgotten that the product they are selling is historical evidence, and they have violated collectors' trust by support- ing the alteration of that evidence (even when they have disclosed it). Brown's article makes this incredible assertion: "To restore or not to restore? … In large measure, it comes down to personal preference" (p.45). How can the commission of crimes against the integrity of historical documentation be so easily dismissed as "personal preference"? To condone the alteration of artifacts for cosmetic reasons is to rob collecting of meaning as a serious intellectual pursuit. The market for twentieth-century jackets, which supports the restoration business, remains strong. Just how strong is illustrated by the fact that Bonham's auction house, in the catalogue for its 10 June 2009 sale in New York, placed an estimate of $80,000-$120,000 on Maurice Goldstone's copy of the first printing of The Great Gatsby in a slightly frayed jacket (whereas a copy without the jacket was estimated at $1500–$2500). The price actually fetched by the jacketed copy was $182,000, and the unjacketed copy brought $3,660 (both figures inclusive of the buyer's premium). Another aspect of the interest in twentieth-century jackets is the continuing production of books on the art of paperback-cover and jacket design: recent examples are Kevin Johnson's The Dark Page: Books That Inspired American Film Noir (1940–1949) (2007); 5 5. This book was the subject of an uninformed review by Eric Korn ("Come to Dust Jackets") in the Times Literary Supplement on 21 March 2008 (p. 15). Corrections to this piece were made in two subsequent letters, one from Alan Hewer (28 March, p. 6) and one from me (4 April, p. 6). Bond Bound 007: Ian Fleming and the Art of Cover Design , edited by Selina Skipwith (2008); and David M. Earle's Re-Covering Modernism (2009). 6 6. Other less ambitious studies have also appeared as articles. An example is Diane De Blois, "Dust Jackets &amp; Edgar Wallace," Book Source Magazine , 22.2 (January-February 2006), 28–34 (which spends the bulk of its space on the general history of jackets). The role of the book trade in the history of the study and appreciation of jackets was a major strand of my recent article. In connection with early jackets, the name of Ken Leach, a Brattleboro (Vermont) dealer, loomed large in the article because of the major collection of American pre-1901 jackets that he formed in the 1970s and sold at auction in 1984 (608 lots). His death in 2007 deserves to be recorded here, as well as the fact that Marcus McCorison wrote a long obituary of him. 7 7. "Kenneth G. Leach [1926–2007]," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 118 (2008), 25–36. McCorison devotes a paragraph to the unsuccessful 1984 auction, noting that "Leach was bitterly disappointed by what he considered the obtuseness of collectors and librarians who, failing to recognize the significance of book coverings to bibliographic inquiry, did not take advantage of his offer- ing." As McCorison says, "The sale may have been held before its time." The results would clearly be far different today. Since my latest article, two dealers have become particularly active in the study and collecting of early jackets: Mark Godburn (The Bookmark, North Canaan, Connecticut) and Tom Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, New Jersey). In 2008 Godburn established a website entitled "Nineteenth Century Dust Jackets: An Illustrated History" (http://nineteenth- centurydustjackets.com), which announced his plans for writing such a history, offered a "picture gallery" of early jackets, and encouraged people to report information about book-jacket history and to send images of jackets they have access to. In October 2009 he changed the site to one that accommodates blog- ging (http://earlydustjackets.blogspot.com/). Although the new site has fewer illustrations of jackets, it originally had a longer text, which excerpted the preface to his forthcoming book and quoted Lewis Carroll's letter of 6 February 1876 to Macmillan discussing the jacket for The Hunting of the Snark . This site could become a useful clearinghouse. 8 8. Godburn has also published an article on early jackets and wrappings reported in the past and now lost, as well as on an unreported wrapping from 1829: "The Earliest Dust Jackets—Lost and Found," Script &amp; Print , 32 (2008), 233–39. Godburn has been buying many of the pre-1901 jackets that have come to his attention, as has Congalton, whose more extensive collection now incorporates the assemblages formed by two other dealers. Ap- parently Congalton has not yet amassed as many jackets as Leach did, but he is well on his way. The efforts of these two dealers will significantly contribute to the future study of book-jacket history. II It is not surprising that far more English and American book-jackets survive from the 1890s than from any earlier decade, simply because those years are nearer to the present: presumably many more could be located from the first and second decades of the twentieth century, if anyone were trying to do so. One might instead have thought that the quantity of survivals from the 1890s indicates that the custom of using jackets had by then become more widespread among publishers than it was earlier; but the nature of the survivals from the 1870s and 1880s, if not their number, makes that conclusion seem unlikely. The use of jackets was a well-established publishing practice many years before the 1890s began. 9 9. For the nineteenth-century background against which the details that follow should be viewed, see my 2006 article, pp. 78–88. The relatively large number of survivals from the 1890s, however, does make possible more detailed comments and more reliable generalizations than can be made for earlier decades. My list shows, for example, that the major publishers in both Britain and America used jackets regularly throughout the 1890s, and some publishers are represented by large numbers of survivals. Although chance inevi- tably determines to some extent which jackets have survived and which of them I have learned about, the numbers are obviously also influenced by the extent of each publisher's output and the number of copies printed. Two of the largest American publishers of the time, Harper in New York and Houghton Mifflin in Boston, are each represented by well over a hundred examples from the 1890s. 10 10. If one includes with Houghton Mifflin the books bearing the primary imprint of its Riverside Press, the total for Houghton Mifflin comes to 126. There are from three to four dozen from such other prominent New York firms as Appleton, Century, Crowell, Dodd Mead, and Scribner, and from Little, Brown in Boston; and Macmillan and Putnam follow with about two dozen. Many publishers of the second rank, from a literary point of view, brought out widely popular books and extensive reprint series, and these publishers also put jackets on their books, as the numerous examples from such firms as Henry Altemus, A. L. Burt, H. M. Caldwell, Estes &amp; Lauriat, Lee &amp; Shepard, and L. C. Page show. And there are surviving jackets (if fewer in number) from many other well-known firms from New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. But to il- lustrate the pervasiveness of jackets, one needs also to look at small firms located outside the major publishing centers. Flood &amp; Vincent of Meadville, Pennsylva- nia, for instance, placed a jacket on Virna Woods's The Amazons (91.19), 11 11. Parenthetical citations are to the entry numbers in the list; they also serve to identify the year of publication, since the first two digits refer to the year (or, in the case of 1900, the first four). as Dar- ling &amp; Co. of Keene, New Hampshire, did on Anna J. Granniss's Sandwort and Skipped Stitches (98.21–22), and as Helman-Taylor of Cleveland did on Ludovico Cornaro's A Treatise on Temperance and Sobriety (98.52). The same point is made by the presence of jackets on privately printed or self-published books, such as A. I. Root's The ABC of Bee Culture (91.58, Medina, Ohio), M. A. Hunt's How to Grow Cut Flowers (93.59, Terre Haute, Ind.), William D. Armes's bibliography of George Meredith (98.95, Berkeley), and Bradford Peck's The World a Department Store (1900.119, Lewiston, Me.). The situation was not different in Britain, though the number of examples I have recorded is far fewer: only thirteen percent of the entries in my list represent British publishers. This fact should not, however, be taken to mean that the cus- tom of using jackets was less common in England and Scotland; all it signifies is that I have had more opportunities for locating American jackets. My confidence on this point derives from the general pattern that emerges. Thus two major publishers—Macmillan and Longmans, Green—are especially well represented, with examples stretching throughout the decade. Other leading publishers (such as Bell, Adam &amp; Charles Black, Blackie, Dent, Heinemann, Murray, Kegan Paul, and Unwin) are present with examples from different parts of the decade; John Lane, who could only appear in the second half of the decade (after his break with Elkin Mathews in 1894), is represented by eleven examples from 1896 through 1900. Still others (including such notable names as Chatto &amp; Windus, Sampson Low, Grant Richards, Routledge, and Warne) are also here, but with one or two entries each. Examples from outside London range from well-known firms such as Blackwood of Edinburgh and MacLehose &amp; Sons of Glasgow to David Bryce (Glasgow) and Eneas Mackay (Stirling), as well as a private printing for G. Moreton (Seal Chart, near Sevenoaks). The generalizations that can be made about the physical appearance of jack- ets in the 1890s apply to those produced on both sides of the Atlantic. Jackets from any location vary among themselves, of course, but the differences (as to which surfaces are printed and what is printed on them, for example) exist both within Britain and within America. 12 12. I am concerned here only with printed jackets, since plain ones may have been sup- plied by the owners of books rather than the publishers. For a discussion of owner-supplied jackets in the nineteenth century, see my 2006 article, pp. 82–84, where note 82 lists some unprinted jackets that were probably produced by the publishers. During this period, jackets had not yet sup- planted bindings as the place where designers and artists were asked to concen- trate their efforts. The decade of the nineties was at the heart of the great period of edition-binding designs, and the jackets were meant simply to protect the bind- ings and not normally to be objects of artistic interest in their own right. When decorations or illustrations do appear on them, they are almost always repeated from the binding: designs were not specially commissioned for the jackets. It is not surprising that jackets at this time were still thought of as protective cover- ings, or that the idea of letting jacket designs supplant binding designs did not emerge instantly. But what is surprising is how sporadically the backs and flaps of jackets were taken advantage of for advertising. The most common style of jacket in the 1890s had printing on the spine and (often) on the front, with all the other surfaces blank. The paper was usually cream, gray, or tan, with printing in black or brown (or sometimes another color). What was printed on the spine was the title and the author's and publisher's names, and the front carried the title and the author's name, all usually repro- duced from the binding. But occasionally both surfaces had additional printing. The price, for example, sometimes appeared on the spine, probably more often in England than in America: English examples come from Black (92.4), Macmil- lan (92.56), Chatto &amp; Windus (94.20), Unwin (95.102), Lane (96.73), Heinemann (98.51, 1900.61), and Simpkin, Marshall (1900.132); American ones come from Harper (93.50, 97.51, 99.52, 99.54–55) and Doubleday, Page (1900.45). 13 13. Examples cited to illustrate characteristics of jackets are very selective. For many en- tries in the list, I do not have information about the nature of the printing; if I did, there would be more entries from which to choose examples. The year might also be given on the spine, though apparently with less frequency, as in examples from the London firms of John C. Nimmo (97.98) and Longmans, Green (98.77). Occasionally, in a practice that began earlier and continued well into the twentieth century, an indication of the number of copies sold was also printed on the spine (see the Hutchinson example with "Sixteenth Thousand" on the spine [94.62]). The price and date also occurred, in rare instances, on the front panel: ex- amples of the former come from Macmillan of London (97.92) and Baker &amp; Taylor (99.9); of the latter from the British firms Kegan Paul (93.83), MacLehose (97.90), and Bell (98.6). Although the dominant style of the front panel was very plain (when printed at all), there is no shortage of examples of jackets with fronts that contain designs or illustrations taken from the book covers, though printed in fewer colors or a single one. When a binding was designed by a well-known designer, or when it reproduced from within the book a picture by a prominent illustrator, the jacket that repeated such a binding or illustration became a sepa- rate object displaying the work of a famous artist (though apparently not saved as such any more than unembellished jackets were). Among the artists for whom such examples survive are Helen Maitland Armstrong (99.121), Margaret Arm- strong (99.120, 1900.41), Walter Crane (98.39), W. W. Denslow (99.58), George Wharton Edwards (98.35), Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (93.101), Laurence Housman (93.76, with his initials on the back; 94.73), E. W. Kemble (93.13), Frederic Remington (92.48), Bruce Rogers (97.108), Amy Sacker (99.80), Ernest Seton Thompson (99.3), Elihu Vedder (94.54), Gleeson White (97.55), and Sarah Wyman Whitman (97.58), as well as the Decorative Designers (98.80, 1900.89). The idea of reusing decorative elements present on bindings apparently stemmed from a recognition that the simple, drab jackets did nothing to attract book- buyers. Although booksellers undoubtedly removed the jackets from a few copies of certain books for display, the repetition of binding decoration on jackets served in every case to draw attention to the book and suggest something of the splendor that often lay beneath the jacket. 14 14. Other examples of pictorial jackets, selected to represent a dozen publishers: 92.46, Lee &amp; Shepard; 93.69, Little, Brown; 94.63, Keppler &amp; Schwartzmann; 94.79, Page; 97.26–27, Conkey; 97.74, Knight; 98.56, Houghton Mifflin; 99.27, Crowell; 99.35, Dodd, Mead; 99.133, Stokes; 1900.1, Altemus; 1900.24, Clark. In some instances, instead of repeating the covers, the jacket fronts reprinted the title pages (91.10–12, Dutton; 91.38, Little, Brown; 94.86, Roberts Brothers; 97.99, Nister). Blurbs did show up on jacket fronts, especially late in the decade, though with far less frequency than in the twentieth century. Several Harper ex- amples are known (96.46, 97.51, 99.49–50, 99.52, 99.54; also Harper of London, 1900.52); the practice was also employed by (among others) Dodd, Mead (99.36, 99.38), Doubleday (97.41, 99.41, 99.43, 1900.46), Houghton Mifflin (95.53), Lit- tle, Brown (98.75, where reviews are quoted; 1900.87), and Revell (99.113). Even advertising for other books could appear on the fronts of jackets, but this practice was probably limited primarily to books in series, with the advertisement relating to the whole series (as in a Little, Brown example, 98.74). The backs and flaps of jackets, though usually blank in the 1890s, were nev- ertheless used for advertising in a considerable number of instances. The backs were seized for this purpose before the flaps were, and there are dozens of ex- amples of advertising on jacket backs throughout the decade. Sometimes there was a list of books by the same author as the book covered by the jacket (92.46, Lee &amp; Shepard); sometimes a related book was publicized, as when Lew Wallace's The Prince of India was praised on the back of the jacket for a book about the illustrations in Ben-Hur (93.52, Harper); and at other times a different author's books were advertised, as when the jacket for George Du Maurier's The Martian (98.37) advertises Thomas Hardy's novels on the back, or the one for a book by the critic Harry Thurston Peck (98.48) advertises the "New Library Editions" of Mark Twain, or the one for Stephen Crane's Whilomville Stories (1900.53) adver- tises titles by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman. 15 15. A few additional examples (out of many) of advertising on backs, from every year of the decade and a variety of English and American publishers, are the following: 91.58, Root; 92.8, Burt; 93.98, Street &amp; Smith; 94.78, Newnes; 95.84, Kegan Paul; 96.83, McKay; 97.1, Allen; 98.51, Heinemann; 99.52–54, Harper; 1900.44–46, Doubleday, Page. The last four mentioned are Harper books, but there was no uniformity in Harper practice: the backs were frequently blank or displayed only the publisher's device (92.25, 92.27, 93.33). (Another nearly blank style of back—with only the price printed there—appeared on a Dent book [93.21].) Although advertising on backs was usually for books, it oc- casionally dealt with other products, as when Rhodes &amp; McClure used that space to advertise the "Audiphone for the Deaf" (98.101, 99.15) or when Little, Brown placed an advertisement for a meat company on the back of the jacket for Mrs. Lincoln's Boston Cook Book (99.89). Illustrations might also appear on backs (96.16, Appleton; 98.73, 99.88, Little, Brown, both on Lafcadio Hearn titles), and blurbs as well (99.51, 1900.60, Harper; 1900.132, Simpkin, Marshall; 1900.134, Stokes). Although the use of jacket flaps for advertising was not infrequent throughout the decade, it was not as common as the placement of ads on backs. Sometimes there was printing only on the back flap (96.31, Crowell; 97.96, Mansfield) or only on the front flap (93.16, 97.31, Crowell; 96.92, Macmillan of New York; 97.123, Vir; 1900.89, Little, Brown). There was a series of Little, Brown jackets in which ads appeared on the front flap, even though there was no printing on either the back flap or the back panel (97.83, 98.75, 1900.87, 1900.93). More often, when the flaps were printed at all, both flaps were used (examples are 93.67, Lippincott; 93.91, Scott; 94.22, 97.34, Crowell; 94.62, Hutchinson; 94.64, Knight; 94.75, Macmillan of New York; 98.35, Funk &amp; Wagnalls; 98.80, Long- mans, Green; 99.113, 1900.127, Revell; 1900.39, Dillingham). (These examples again illustrate how a single firm followed varying patterns: Crowell is cited for using the front flap alone in 1893 and 1897, the back flap alone in 1896, and both flaps in 1894 and 1897.) In one Revell example, the advertisements on the flaps took the form of illustrations of books (91.53). On rare occasions, the front flap carried text other than advertising: Harper is known to have placed instructions on "How to Open a Book" on the front flap (98.40); and the price sometimes ap- peared there, as in examples from three Boston firms (94.2, Arena; 94.67, Lee &amp; Shepard; 99.10, Beacon Press). Books in series—and there were a great many publishers' series in the 1890s—form a special category because the urge to call attention to all the titles in a series led to jackets covered on all surfaces with listings and series numbers (useful to later scholars, of course, for publishing history). Particularly in the case of reprint series, there was often a single all-purpose jacket to be used on every volume in the series; they often carried the series binding design on their fronts but were otherwise filled with enumerations of titles in small type. The busy surfaces produced a very different look from the uncluttered style prevalent on jackets for other books. These generic jackets thus did not indicate the title or author of the particular book enclosed by the jacket (1900.43, an example of Donohue's "Vassar Series"). One solution to this problem is illustrated by an English example of a single-author series, the works of G. A. Henty published by Blackie: a printed label with the individual title was stuck on the spine of the jacket (92.6). A circular hole in the spine was another solution, but not limited to books in series (X.57, Macmillan of London, ca. 1896; 97.53, Heinemann). Generic jackets were not the universal rule for series, however; separate printings that identified the individual book within the jacket and gave its series number were also produced, with these two pieces of information either on the front (98.101, Rhodes &amp; McClure; 1900.2, Altemus) or on the spine (X.64, Altemus, ca. 1898). Some Altemus jackets were typical in having fronts, backs, and flaps all covered with ads for various series (96.1, 96.3–4); but the need for additional space to list all the titles in one or more series meant that the inside of the jacket (the surface touching the book) was not ignored, as in the jackets for Porter &amp; Coates's "Alta" series (X.47–48, ca. 1895)—a practice that was regularly used in the twentieth century for extensive series such as "The Modern Library." 16 16. Several further examples (out of many) of ads for series may be mentioned. On backs alone: 92.9, Caldwell; 95.9–10, Burt; 98.29, Dodd, Mead; 99.40, Donohue, Henneberry. On backs and flaps: 97.13, Benziger; 98.99, Revell; 99.111, Rand McNally; 1900.51, Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Still other examples can be located through the references to series in the index to publishers below (series names are in quotation marks). It is clear that publishers did not have a standard jacket style that they fol- lowed consistently, but a further kind of variation was the one between copies of jackets for a single title. The fact that variant jackets from the 1890s exist (and once existed more profusely) should not be unexpected, for they could have re- sulted from at least two kinds of likely situations. One is that a new printing of a book called for a new supply of jackets as well; and the new jackets might be made of a different color of paper, or have printing of a different color, or carry printing on a previously blank surface (or vice versa). Detecting specific print- ings of nineteenth-century books is notoriously difficult (since often there is no obvious clue on the title or copyright page), and the existence of variant jackets should give bibliographers additional incentive to examine the books closely for signs of reprinting. (Although one can never be certain that the jacket presently on a book was always there, dealers have had little opportunity to switch jackets on nineteenth-century books because of the rarity of surviving jackets.) Alterna- tively, variant jackets may well be found on copies of the same printing of a book, if jackets were produced in batches smaller than the total number of copies of the book—as was frequently the situation with the bindings themselves. Which of these explanations accounts for each of the variant jackets in my list has not been determined. There are variations in the color of the printing (91.60, Saalfield &amp; Fitch; 99.34, Dana, Estes), in the color of the paper (92.63, Kegan Paul), and in the text, as in an example from Little, Brown (91.38) where one version of the front repeats the title page in red and black, while the other partially repeats the cover in green. Two books that have been of interest to collectors illustrate variations in the choice of jacket surfaces to be printed: the jacket for James Whitcomb Riley's The Flying Islands of the Night (92.7, Bowen- Merrill) can have a blank or a printed spine; that for Ambrose Bierce's Fantastic Fables (99.106, Putnam) can have a blank or a printed front flap. Two kinds of detachable coverings common in the 1890s that do not fore- shadow twentieth-century practice are cloth jackets and boxes with lids. 17 17. All the cloth jackets in my list can be located by the presence of "¢" to the left of the entry numbers; all the boxes (of any kind) by the presence of "†" or "‡", as explained in the headnote to the list. Cloth jackets could be thin when made of cloth only (91.43, McClurg; 92.65, pri- vately printed), but they were generally made of cloth backed with stiff paper. They were used primarily for fancy gift editions of two-volume travel accounts or standard texts, which usually contained illustrations and had elaborate bind- ings with gilt much in evidence. For additional protection and greater luxurious- ness, the books were also supplied with boxes. Such jackets, often red, blue, or green, normally had blank surfaces except for the title and author's name in gold (sometimes black) on the spines. In rare instances, there might be a printed paper label on the spine (96.51, Houghton Mifflin). Printing on cloth-jacket fronts did sometimes occur (1900.59, Harper), and there are even instances of cover illus- trations being repeated (93.54, Houghton Mifflin; 98.107, Russell). More than one color of cloth jacket might be used for a given book (1900.26, Coates)—a practice reminiscent of the treatment of cloth bindings earlier in the century, when different colors were often available simultaneously, though it may simply mean that the jackets were produced at different times. Boxes took several forms in addition to the slip-case (with an open side where the spines are), which became the dominant style in the twentieth century. Even boxes in slip-case form were frequently not meant to stand with the open (spine) side perpendicular to the shelf but rather with the open side on top (so that the books—usually there were two jacketed books—rested on their fore-edges). The red cloth-covered box for Hawthorne's The Marble Faun in two illustrated vol- umes (95.52, Houghton Mifflin), for example, has printing in gold on one end (in- cluding the title and the author's and publisher's names), with the words running parallel to the shorter dimension and right-side-up when the box is standing with the open side on top. (The bottom of the box, where the fore-edges of the book rest, rather than being covered with cloth like the other surfaces, has a piece of plain white paper pasted on it.) Another similar red-cloth box with gold lettering on one end was produced by Coates for Edmondo de Amicis's two-volume Spain and the Spaniards (95.17). A Harper example, for Lew Wallace's two-volume The Prince of India (93.53), follows the same model, except that the box is covered with white paper and the lettering on the end is on an affixed label. Three examples of two-volume sets from Macmillan (New York) illustrate the same form, with boxes of paper- covered cardboard, but in these instances the printing (which includes the price) is on one of the two large sides, again running parallel to the open side and set to be read when the open side is on top (94.76, 95.75, 97.94). Another style was identical to these in every way except that there was a removable lid to cover the top (spine) side. Doubleday &amp; McClure's two-volume set of Kipling's From Sea to Sea (99.42) came out in a dark green paper-covered box and lid, with a printed label on one end and a plain tan paper bottom. Another style of box for two-volume works is illustrated by the box that Roberts Brothers produced for Emily Dickinson's Letters (94.85): the opening is on one end, and the label (in this case a leather label printed in gold) is on one of the two narrower sides, thus resembling a spine label. Boxes for larger sets of books (more than two volumes), a feature of earlier decades, continued to appear in the 1890s. Examples devoted to single authors are the Mershon Company's publication (after 1893) of six of Edna Lyall's nov- els, packed fore-edge down in a paper-covered box with a detachable lid and a printed label on one end (X.39); George Allen's six-volume Faerie Queene in a blue-cloth-covered box with a hinged lid printed in gold on its front edge (97.2); and Crowell's twelve-volume set of Browning in a red-cloth-covered wooden box, printed in gold on the front and with a printed label inside the top (98.16). Shakespeare was a natural for this kind of treatment, and two known examples from about 1895 are a 24-volume set in a black leather box (X.43, Knickerbocker Leather &amp; Novelty Co.) and a thirteen-volume set in a red cloth box (X.46, McKay). As for multi-author series, Scribner placed its ten-volume sets of "Sto- ries by American Authors" (94.88) and "Stories by English Authors" (99.124) in boxes with printed labels, as did Curtis for its "Ladies' Home Journal Library of Fiction" (99.33) and Houghton Mifflin for its "Little Classics" (99.68). Boxes for books in series often had hinged lids, like "The Christian Herald Library" in ten volumes (95.7, Bible House), with gold lettering on the lid. 18 18. An example of a series in which the volumes were boxed separately was referred to in Publishers' Weekly , 42 (28 January 1893), 207: Crowell's "Illustrated Edition of Popular Poets," available in "cloth slip wrappers, each book in a cloth box." An altogether different kind of box was frequently used for single-volume gift editions: a shallow box, in which the book lies flat, with a removable lid (often with a printed label on the top or the edge of the lid). Such boxes were commonly used for small, heavily illustrated, volumes of poetry, such as Joseph Knight's Songs from the Great Poets (92.43); but they were used for other kinds of books as well, such as R. H. Russell's "Maude Adams Edition" of J. M. Barrie's The Little Minister (99.118). A rare example of a box tailored to the subject matter is the one H. M. Caldwell produced for John Bain's Tobacco in Song and Story (99.15): it resembles a cigar box and has lithographed labels on top. 19 19. Other oddities exist, interesting as examples of inventiveness but of no use in docu- menting standard practice, such as jackets of celluloid printed in gold (93.9–10, Cassino), jackets of suede printed in gold (1900.34, Crowell), jackets over attached wrappers (91.33, Kerr; 1900.50, Goupil), jackets with flaps at top and bottom as well as the sides (91.55, Riverside Press [commented on below]; 99.125, Scribner), or jackets with yapp edges at top and bottom (92.68, Riverside Press). (For comments on jackets over wrappers, see my 2006 article, p. 89, note 95.) Printed envelopes have sometimes been used to enclose thin pamphlets since the eighteenth century, but there are only three in my 1890s list (95.81, Nister; 97.36, Crowell; X.100, Toyme Press, ca. 1900). In 1972 Matthew J. Bruccoli said, " The Red Badge of Courage [1895] appears to be the first great American novel issued with a dust jacket." 20 20. "Stephen Crane as a Collector's Item," in Stephen Crane in Transition: Centenary Es- says , ed. Joseph Katz (1972), p. 164. He adds that "copies in jackets have not attracted special attention"—a statement true then but not now. A less controversial way of approaching the subject of jacketed books by prominent authors of the nineteenth century would be to say simply that first editions by a number of great or significant writers appeared in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and that all (or nearly all) of them were probably covered with jackets when published. Because of the rarity of jackets from this period, however, few collectors have been able to find them. Bruccoli's own Crane collection, sold at auction in 1974, contained jacketed copies of three Appleton titles (with jackets printed on fronts and spines only), The Red Badge of Courage (95.2), The Little Regiment (96.8), and The Third Violet (97.8), as well as The Open Boat (98.31, Doubleday &amp; McClure) and Active Service (99.131, Stokes). David J. Supino, in his collection of Henry James, has at least six nineteenth-century James jackets, going back to French Poets and Novelists (Macmillan of London, 1878); the other five are from the 1890s, four of them American, printed on the spines only (93.46, 94.41, 95.43, Harper; 99.67, Houghton Mifflin), and one English, printed on the front and spine (1900.61, Heinemann). In his impressively detailed record of his collection, Henry James: A Bibliographical Catalogue of a Collection of Editions to 1921 (2006), Supino pays careful attention to jackets and illustrates the 1878 one. Another collector who has described his collection in print and discussed the jackets it contains is Kevin Mac Donnell; his 1998 article in Firsts on "Collecting Mark Twain" (8.7/8 [July/ August], 24–61) provides photographs of the Harper jackets for How to Tell a Story (97.52) and The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg (1900.58). (My 1890s list records eight items for Crane, eight for James, and six for Twain.) This select group of American authors must also include Emily Dickinson, some of whose work was appearing posthumously in the 1890s (three jacketed examples are in my list), and William Dean Howells, who is represented in my list with fifteen titles (many of them brought out by Harper). But there are many other significant American writers who were publishing in the 1890s and for whom multiple examples of jacketed books from that period are known to survive. They include Thomas Bailey Aldrich, John Kendrick Bangs, John Burroughs, Finley Peter Dunne, Eugene Field, John Fiske, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Joel Chandler Harris, Lafcadio Hearn, Sarah Orne Jewett, Thomas Nelson Page, and Laura E. Richards. Among English authors there are Austin Dobson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Andrew Lang, and Robert Louis Stevenson. (Other important names from both countries appear in my list, represented by only one or two entries.) Not surprisingly, a considerable number of first editions by popular novelists of the day, as well as reprints of perennially favorite writers, survive in jackets. The first category includes F. Marion Crawford, Richard Har- ding Davis, Paul Leicester Ford, S. Weir Mitchell, F. Hopkinson Smith, and Lew Wallace; the second, Alcott, Blackmore, Bulwer-Lytton, Dickens, Drummond, Hawthorne, Holmes, Irving, Longfellow, Lowell, and Scott. The publication of complete sets of authors' works was not uncommon in the 1890s, and presumably most of them appeared in jackets, even though I have so far located fewer than a dozen examples of jacketed sets. Since sets often went unread, one might at first expect a high rate of survival for their jackets, and in- deed more are sure to turn up. But since for much of the twentieth century sets were not a very salable commodity in used-book stores, becoming almost per- manent residents of dealers' shelves, it is likely that many dealers discarded the increasingly soiled and frayed jackets to improve the appearance of the sets. In any case, three English publishers are known (from my list) to have used jackets on their sets: John C. Nimmo on a 48-volume Scott (92.59); Osgood, McIlvaine on a 16-volume Hardy (95.83); and Chapman &amp; Hall on a 34-volume Dickens (97.22). The Scott came out in both a large-paper and a small-paper form, with different jackets: the large-paper had printing only on the spines, the small-paper on the fronts as well as the spines. In America, the Philadelphia office of Reuwee, Wattley &amp; Walch undertook a 26-volume edition of Ruskin and placed on each volume a blue cloth jacket with a printed paper label on the spine (91.52). Harper also used cloth jackets on its set of Motley (1900.55). The Riverside Press added a touch of luxury to its set of Holmes by making jackets that had extra flaps at the top and bottom, so that each board of the book was covered on all three of its outer edges (91.55). Evidence of jackets also exists for Houghton Mifflin's sets of Stowe (96.64), Lowell (99.71), and Burroughs (1900.65) and Scribner's set of Eugene Field (96.115). Many of these observations about book-jackets and publishers' boxes in the 1890s are very probably applicable to the preceding ten or fifteen years as well. But the richer evidence available for the 1890s, even though it still reflects only a tiny fraction of all the jacketed books that were published, 21 21. The total number of books published in the United States alone in the 1891–1900 period was 51,808—according to the Publishers' Weekly figures conveniently tabulated by John Tebbel in A History of Book Publishing in the United States. Volume II: The Expansion of an Industry, 1865–1919 (1975), pp. 684–93. allows a more de- tailed picture to be constructed, and with greater confidence. Clearly there was no uniformity in the treatment of jacket surfaces, not even within individual pub- lishing firms. But by the end of the decade the use of jacket fronts as a place for decoration or illustration (if only from the binding) and of jacket backs and flaps as spaces for advertising was well established (if not always practiced), and blurbs were appearing with greater frequency. Other, very occasional, foreshadowings of twentieth-century jackets were the inclusion of a photograph of the author (98.76) 22 22. The only example in my list (as far as I am aware) of an author's picture on a jacket is the one discussed by Ted Morgan in Churchill: Young Man in a Hurry, 1874–1915 (1982), p. 93: Churchill's picture appears on the jacket of his The Story of the Malakand Field Force (Longmans, Green, 1898). and the use of a decoration not on the cover of the book (91.60) or an illustration not inside the book (92.48, 99.47, X.81). 23 23. Stray instances of these latter two practices did occur much earlier, as on an 1859 edition of Wordsworth's Pastoral Poems (Sampson Low) reported to me by Mark Godburn. An example in my 1890s list of a decoration not on the cover of the book is the red and black de- sign on the jacket of Craven L. Betts's The Perfume-Holder (Saalfield &amp; Fitch, 1891). Examples of jacket illustrations in the 1890s that reportedly are not present within the books are a Frederic Remington illustration on the front of the jacket for the 1892 Little, Brown edition of Francis Parkman's The Oregon Trail (illustrated by Remington), a Walter Crane illustration on the back of the jacket for his A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden (Harper of London, 1899), and an illustration on the front of the jacket for Charles C. Coffin's Following the Flag (Dana, Estes, 1898 or later). No one would mistake any of the 1890s jackets for twentieth-century ones; but the elements were all there, ready for rapid development as the jacket became a new focus for graphic design, replacing the binding in this regard. The stage was set for the explosion of jacket art in the 1910s and the establishment of a pattern of jacket layout that has been followed ever since. A LIST OF EXAMPLES, 1891–1900, OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN PUBLISHERS' PRINTED BOOK-JACKETS, BOXES, AND OTHER DETACHABLE COVERINGS This list does not attempt to be a census of all surviving examples; it is simply a record of those that have come to my attention over a period of about forty years. A great many more certainly exist; but because the list is sizable (with over eleven hundred entries), it provides a reasonable body of evidence for generalizing about the history of publishers' detachable coverings in the 1890s. (A list for the pre-1891 period, with nearly four hundred entries, was published in Studies in Bibliography , 56 [2003–04], 95–131.) The list below also gives one a basis for extrapolation: by noting which publishers are known to have used jackets or boxes (slip-cases, boxes with lids, etc.) during this time, and on what kinds of books, one is in a better position to conjecture whether any other books from the same years were likely to have had such coverings at the time of their publication. (In the case of series, one can be nearly certain that the other titles in a series, in addition to those listed here, had jackets; but the list records only the specific titles known to have survived in jackets.) Entries are arranged chronologically, and within each year they are ordered alphabetically by publisher (then author). The year of each entry is the date of the copy cited, which may be later than the date of the first printing. I have generally repeated the dates given in my sources without further investigation (which would in any case probably be inconclusive without the copies at hand); but when I have reason to suspect that the year assigned by a source is based on a copyright-page date and that the book may possibly be from a later printing, I have placed an asterisk after the citation. Copies that have been assigned ap- proximate dates are listed separately at the end. The serial numbers assigned to the entries consist of the last two digits of the year, followed—after a period—by consecutive numbers within the year. (For the entries of 1900, all four digits of the year are used; and for entries in the "Approximate Dates" section, an "X" replaces the year-digits.) Citations of pre-1891 entries refer to the list in volume 56 of Studies in Bibliography . The amount of information in the entries varies considerably, depending on what was available in my sources and notes. Each entry normally has four parts (though the third is lacking in some instances). (1) Publisher and city (usually ex- cluding the names of any secondary publishers or cities mentioned in imprints). (2) Author, title, and (if applicable) series or edition (with the names of editors, illustrators, and translators selectively added). (3) A brief description of the jacket and/or box, indicating—when my information allows—the color (if other than white, gray, tan, or cream), the surfaces containing printed matter (with unusual features of the content mentioned), and the color of the printing (when other than black). (4) Source(s), including institutional libraries, private collections (with years signifying the latest date when to my knowledge the books were in those collections), dealers' and auction-house catalogues, published articles and books, and private letters or conversations; when the citations (in all these categories) are brief, they are usually identified more fully in the index. Published illustra- tions of jackets are referred to in the following entries: 92.58, 93.40, 93.80, 94.78, 95.2, 95.72, 96.119, 97.20, 97.52, 97.55, 99.50, 99.60, 99.99, 99.106, 1900.58, 1900.135. The following symbols are used to signal entries for detachable coverings other than jackets of the now conventional type: § envelope or all-over wrapping ¢ cloth jacket(s) † box (slip-case, box with lid, etc.) ‡ box and paper jacket(s) †¢ box and cloth jacket(s) The index to the list is subdivided as follows: (1) Authors, editors, illustrators, and translators (plus personal-name subjects, and titles without named authors). (2) Publishers and series: British (London); British (other than London); Ameri- can (New York); American (other than New York). (3) Libraries. (4) Collectors. (5) Dealers and auction houses. (6) Scholars (and other persons who have pro- vided information, not covered under previous headings, in published or unpub- lished form). My acknowledgments remain the same as those enumerated on page 94 of Studies in Bibliography , volume 56, with the addition of these names: Tom Congal- ton, Mark Godburn, John Lancaster, and Patrick Spedding. My indebtedness to the first two for their extensive reports is suggested by the length of their entries in the index. 1891 ‡ 91.1. Altemus (Philadelphia). Henry Drummond, Addresses .
