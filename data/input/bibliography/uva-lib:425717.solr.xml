      <field name="fulltext">If the third quarter of the twentieth century can be considered—as it often is—an age of editing, one of the principal reasons is the existence and influence of two American organizations: the National Historical Publications Commission (NHPC), renamed in late 1974 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC); and the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA), succeeded in 1976 by the Center for Scholarly Editions (CSE). The NHPC (NHPRC) 1 has since 1950 given encouragement and assistance to a large number of multi-volume editions (more than four dozen) of the papers of American statesmen, especially those of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the CEAA, from 1963 through 1976, gave its official approval to volumes in fourteen editions, predominantly of the works of nineteenth-century American literary figures. 2 As a result, massive scholarly editions have been produced in an unprecedented quantity during these years; hundreds of scholars have been connected with these projects, and widespread discussion and awareness of the problems and aims of editing have been engendered. The presence of these editions has dramatically altered the scholarly landscape in American history and literature within a generation. 3 When there is so much editorial activity directed toward material from a single country and, for the most part, a single century, one would expect a great deal of communication among the editors involved; indeed, the creation of coordinating organizations like the NHPC and the CEAA suggests a recognition of the need for such communication. However, the fact that two organizations have seemed necessary indicates that the communication has not very readily crossed the boundary lines between academic disciplines. Regrettably, but undeniably, editors of "literary" material and editors of "historical" material 4 have gone their separate ways; members of each group have discussed common problems among themselves but have remained remarkably uninformed about what was taking place in the other group. One does not have to examine many volumes to recognize a central difference between the historical and the literary editions: the historical editions in general give more attention to explanatory annotation than to the detailed recording of textual data, whereas the literary editions reverse this emphasis. It is a fact that most of the historical editions do not meet the standards for reporting textual information established by the CEAA and would therefore not qualify for the award of the CEAA emblem. Whether those particular standards are justifiable is a separate question; what is disturbing is that such different standards should prevail in the two fields. If one could argue that the material edited by historians is different in kind from that edited by literary scholars, there might be some reason to expect different approaches. Indeed, the NHPRC editors do have more occasion to deal with manuscript letters and journals than with texts which were published by their authors, and for CEAA editors the opposite situation prevails. No doubt these relationships are largely responsible for the lesser concern of historians with questions of copy-text and textual variants and for the greater concern of literary scholars with these matters. Nevertheless, literary editors frequently must edit letters and journals, and historical editors must handle statesmen's published, as well as unpublished, works. The editing of literary and of historical material should have many more points of similarity than of difference; and a greater understanding of mutual problems, between the two groups of editors, is bound to have a salutary effect on the editing produced by both groups. There have recently been some encouraging signs to suggest that the dangers of editorial parochialism are perhaps becoming more widely recognized. Most notable is the broadening of the scope of the Modern Language Association's committee on editions: no longer limited to editions of American authors, it now provides simply a "Center for Scholarly Editions"—editions of any kind of material from any time and place—and it has shown itself to be concerned with promoting greater contact between editors in different fields. A similar development is the careful editorial attention which has lately been given to certain philosophers: Jo Ann Boydston's edition of John Dewey (1967- ), Fredson Bowers's of William James (1975- ), and Peter H. Nidditch's of John Locke (1975- )—the first two are CEAA editions—manifest an approach to textual matters which had previously been limited almost exclusively to more clearly bellettristic or "literary" writing. 5 In 1972 Edwin Wolf, 2nd, published a timely and well-considered appeal for historians to begin applying to historical works the techniques of analytical bibliography which have long been associated with literary studies, particularly with the editing of English Renaissance drama. 6 He calls attention to the historian's lack of sophistication in dealing with printed texts by pointing out that two of the most respected editors of historical manuscripts, Julian P. Boyd and Leonard W. Labaree, "never questioned the validity of the text of only a single copy of any printed work" (p. 29). After citing some examples of variants in American printed works of the eighteenth century, he again laments the "tradition of a wall separating bibliography as applied to literary works from bibliography as applied to historical or political works" (p. 37). Nicolas Barker has also found occasion recently to comment on this point: in one of his editorials for the Book Collector he rightly says, "Historians, even more than literary scholars, have been apt to neglect the physical form in which the evidence on which they subsist has been preserved." 7 In many other respects, the situation in which historical editors find themselves is similar to that of literary editors. In each field there was increased recognition, in the years following World War II, of the need for new editions of basic writings. In each field there was one man whose work provided the impetus and model for further work: the first volume of Julian P. Boyd's edition of Jefferson in 1950 set the pattern for many later historical editions, and the publication of that volume was the occasion for President Truman's reactivating the NHPC (which had originally been established in 1934); 8 the first volume of Fredson Bowers's edition of Hawthorne in 1962 was influential among literary editors in showing how the editorial techniques developed for Renaissance plays were applicable to nineteenth-century literature, and soon after its publication the CEAA was formally constituted (1963). 9 In each field there is thus an agency which serves as coordinator and clearinghouse, though with some differences: the NHPRC 10 is a government agency (part of the General Services Administration and housed in the National Archives building), which undertakes to do some research (such as locating relevant manuscripts in archives) for editors; the CEAA 11 was, and the CSE is, a committee of the Modern Language Association of America, which draws some funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities 12 and which calls attention to excellence in editing by awarding an emblem to volumes that qualify (after being requested to inspect printer's copy for those volumes by their editors). In each field there has been some controversy surrounding the new editions, though for characteristically different reasons: criticism of the literary editions has been concerned principally with textual matters, whereas the main questions raised about the historical editions have had to do with the quantity of annotation, the justification for letterpress rather than microform publication, and the choice of material to be edited in the first place. 13 And in each field the editors have found that a great many of their colleagues neither understand nor respect editorial work; 14 in both fields an attempt has been made to improve graduate training in editing and to bring about a greater interest in and acceptance of editorial projects for dissertations—though the historical field, with the various NHPRC conferences, institutes, and fellowships in editing, has been more active in this regard that the literary. 15 Despite some differences, editors in the two fields are in similar enough positions and face similar enough problems that one would expect them not only to be conversant with each other's work but to approach each other's concerns in an understanding and constructive spirit. In fact, however, there is, in the extensive editorial literature in the two fields, 16 practically no discussion which takes up the NHPRC and CEAA editions together or which examines the textual policies of the NHPRC editions in the way those of the CEAA editions have often been examined. The most publicized article of this sort is unfortunately one which confuses the issues more than it clarifies them. Peter Shaw, writing for a general audience in the American Scholar and interested in exploring textual matters, 17 was in a position to inaugurate a period of productive interdisciplinary discussion; but the regrettable tone of some of his remarks, as well as the fact that they are sometimes uninformed and incoherent, results in an essay which cannot command respect or offer a fruitful basis for further discussion. Shaw believes that the historical editors "unquestionably have had far greater success than their literary counterparts" (p. 739) and finds the literary editors' "tragic flaw" to be "their respect for language" (p. 740). But when he then praises the historical editors' "respect for historical fact," since for them "both the text and its variants qualify as historical facts" (p. 743), one becomes lost. His point lacks any real substance because it is based on the superficial view that a modern literary editor produces an "eclectic text" and a historical editor a "faithful transcription of a single text" (p. 739)—without examining, for instance, what kinds of texts and textual histories may lead to a literary editor's decision to be "eclectic" or what kinds of textual facts are not recoverable from many historical editors' "faithful" transcriptions. It is naïve to suggest that "the historical editor requires a literary appreciation of nuance, while the literary editor needs the historian's respect for fact" (p. 740); but one can nevertheless agree with Shaw that "each set of editors might usefully have advised the other"—though not because they have "opposite kinds of problems." What is needed is mutual discussion of common problems, and in this spirit I should like to raise a few questions about the textual policies of some of the historical editions, in the light of what has been learned about editing by the literary editors. In order fairly to assess Shaw's assertion that the historical editors have been more successful, one must examine carefully the editorial rationale and procedures followed by those editors. A survey of the differing practices of a number of editions of letters and journals—both historical and literary—will lead, I think, to a consideration of some underlying issues—issues basic not merely to the editing of the papers of American statesmen but to documentary 18 editing in general.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Three statements of editorial policy for historical editions appeared within the space of five years in the early 1950s; all three have been influential, and an understanding of modern American documentary editing must begin with them. The first, and the most influential, was Julian P. Boyd's account of his "Editorial Method" (pp. xxv-xxxviii) in the first volume of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson , published by Princeton University Press in 1950. 19 Boyd states that his general aim is "rigidly to adhere to scrupulous exactness in the presentation of the texts as Jefferson wrote them" (p. xxviii), but he recognizes that "complete exactitude is impossible in transmuting handwriting into print"; he has therefore worked out a "standard methodology which, though sometimes consciously inconsistent, is nevertheless precise" (p. xxix). From this, one assumes that the only changes to be introduced are those necessitated by the typography. As soon as he starts to explain the methodology, however, one begins to wonder how it supports his aim of adhering to the text with "scrupulous exactness." He says that he is going to follow a "middle course" between "facsimile reproduction" and "complete modernization," except in the case of business papers and of certain important documents (like the Declaration of Independence), which are to be "presented literally." There are thus two categories of material, accorded different treatment: letters and ordinary documents, presented with some degree of "conventionalization"; 20 and business papers and important documents, presented as literally as print allows. Only the treatment of the second category would seem to fulfill the goal of presenting with "scrupulous exactness" the texts "as Jefferson wrote them" or of providing "as accurate a text as possible" which preserves "as many of Jefferson's distinctive mannerisms of writing as can be done" (p. xxix). In the first, and larger, category, spelling, grammar, and capitalization remain unchanged, except that each sentence is made to begin with a capital letter (in contrast to Jefferson's practice). As for punctuation, however, "for the sake of clarity this literal policy will be less rigorously applied" (p. xxx): periods are supplied, when lacking at the ends of sentences, and unnecessary dashes, such as those which follow periods, are deleted. 21 Although this alteration of punctuation is minimal, one may well ask what is gained by eliminating these dashes; they could not cause a modern reader to misinterpret the sense, and, if they are a characteristic of Jefferson's style, to delete them is at best to modernize and at worst to risk losing a nuance of meaning. More troublesome is the treatment of abbreviations and contractions. They are "normally" expanded, with the exception of those designating money or units of measure and weight, those standing for proper names, and a miscellaneous group containing such forms as "wou'd," "do." (for "ditto"), and "&amp;c." (though "&amp;" alone is altered to "and"). The rationale for this arbitrary list of abbreviated forms to be retained is not clear, especially since Boyd recognizes that some of them will require editorial expansion in brackets. If there is a value in preserving these contractions, why should others be expanded silently? Boyd gives an example to show Jefferson's extensive use of abbreviations in hurried jottings: "wd hve retird immedly hd h. nt bn infmd" is expanded into "would have retired immediately had he not been informed" (p. xxxi). The expanded text, Boyd argues, "represents the kind of clear and readable form that Jefferson himself would have used for a document intended for formal presentation in print. It makes for clarity and readability and yet sacrifices nothing of Jefferson's words or meaning." But the document was not in fact intended for formal presentation, and to smooth its text out silently is to conceal the essential nature of the preserved document. And if the nature of a document is misrepresented, even if the literal "meaning" is preserved, can one say absolutely that the meaning has in no way been sacrificed? It is true that a long passage full of such abbreviations would slow the reader down, but the reader's convenience is surely not the primary consideration here. The argument presented for expanding contractions like "wd" and "hd" could just as well be applied to "Wmsbgh," yet contractions of geographical names are allowed to stand. Perhaps this distinction is one of the conscious inconsistencies Boyd alludes to, but the reason for it remains unclear. It is disturbing because it would seem to reflect a wavering between two editorial approaches—an indecisiveness whether to transcribe or to normalize. Three basic decisions about the nature of the edition are implicit in what has been said up to this point. One is that the text is to be critical, in the sense that it incorporates certain kinds of changes dictated by the editor's judgment. A second is that the original text will not be fully recoverable from the data provided; some editorial changes, in other words, will not be recorded. And the third is that the edited text will not be "clear text"—that is, it will incorporate bracketed editorial insertions. These decisions also evidently underlie the treatment of substantive matters, which Boyd turns to next. Conjectured readings are placed in roman type in square brackets and editorial comments (such as " In the margin ") appear in italics in square brackets. Such intrusions suggest precision, and it is therefore unfortunate that a bracketed reading in roman type followed by a question mark can mean two different things: either a conjecture at a point where the manuscript is mutilated and part of the text is missing or else an attempt to read a faded passage or one that is "too illegible to be deciphered with certainty" (p. xxxii). 22 Obvious errors in the original texts are corrected, again indicating that the edited text is a critical one. In writings by Jefferson, the original readings in these instances are provided in notes; in writintgs by others (such as letters to Jefferson), the original readings are not reported—"though," Boyd adds, "if an error has psychological significance it will be allowed to stand, with a note when required." Once it is recognized, however, that errors can have psychological significance, it becomes hard to justify a policy that conceals any of them. And this treatment of errors—emending the text and recording the original readings in notes—is a further reflection of editorial indecisiveness, for it represents a third approach in contrast to the treatment of conjectured readings and of some contractions. In the case of errors, the text is emended but is kept free of editorial symbols; conjectured readings are also placed in the text but are marked there as such; and certain contractions remain unemended but are explained by an editorial insertion in the text. Finally, if two or more copies or drafts of a document exist, variant or canceled readings are reported in notes only when they are "significant." (The variants in fact may not always be known, for it is stated a few pages later that "The editorial policy does not call for full collation of every document extant in more than one version" [p. xxxvi].) 23 Nothing is said about the possibility that a variant reading could call attention to an error in the copy-text, which might then be emended with that variant reading. Of course, if the editorial policy regards each edited text as an edition of a single copy of a document, emendations from other copies would not be allowed. But emendation to correct "obvious errors" is permitted here, and such a category is naturally a subjective one. Can a policy be logically defended which allows the correction of errors that a given editor discovers without recourse to another copy of the text but does not permit the correction of errors that he locates only through examination of another copy? Any procedure that might be called "eclectic" is automatically rejected by some editors. But if a text is not to be presented literally, then the editor's judgment is involved in determining at each point what ought to be in the text; 24 and it is hard to draw a line between being critical (using one's judgment) and being eclectic (considering readings which come from outside a given copy of a text, whether from the editor's head or from another copy of the text). Perhaps such a line could, with careful definition, be worked out; but Boyd's discussion does not acknowledge the existence of this problem, though it implicitly raises the issue. All these points, one must remember, relate to the treatment of letters and "ordinary documents." The other category of texts, "documents of major importance," are handled very differently. They are presented literally, exactly as found in the document supplying the copy-text—though with bracketed editorial insertions when required for clarification. Variant readings, as before, appear in notes; but all of them, not just the "significant" ones, are recorded. Canceled passages, however, are now given in the text, in italics within angle brackets, placed before the revised wording. Aside from the fact that it is unclear why canceled matter should be reported within the text for major documents and in notes for ordinary documents, the approach employed for the major documents is far simpler and more satisfactory than that for the ordinary documents. With the major documents, no complicated rules are necessary, and yet the reader knows exactly what he is using (with one exception to be noted below); with the ordinary documents, in spite of the complex guidelines, he cannot always know the reading of the original or what evidence is available in other copies or drafts. It may be true that fewer people will be interested in textual details about the ordinary documents; but, if those documents are less important, why should considerable editorial effort be expended to make them more conveniently readable, especially when that effort serves to conceal some evidence that could conceivably be of use? The juxtaposition of the two kinds of texts is in itself somewhat awkward; and the straightforward handling of the major documents makes the compromises involved in the treatment of the ordinary documents appear all the more unsatisfactory by contrast. There is, however, one serious weakness in the presentation of the major documents: the system used for recording canceled passages. The simple insertion of canceled matter in angle brackets cannot possibly inform the reader in many cases of the true textual situation, especially when no provision is made for labeling which words or syllables are entered above the line. For instance, in the edited text of Jefferson's first draft of the Virginia constitution of 1776, the following appears: "unless suspended in their operation for his &lt; con &gt; assent" (p. 338, lines 4-5). One would naturally assume that Jefferson had started to write "consent," changed his mind after writing the first syllable, then marked it out and wrote "assent." But a check of the manuscript (reproduced facing p. 414) shows that Jefferson actually wrote "consent" and at some time after that crossed out the first syllable and inserted "as" above it. 25 The printed transcription not only misrepresents the manuscript but fails to show that the revision may have occurred at a time later than that of the original inscription. A few lines later occurs the phrase "endeavoring to prevent the population of our country &lt; by &gt; &amp; for that purpose obstructing the laws" (338.16-17); Jefferson's revision becomes clear only when one knows that "&amp; for that purpose" was inserted above the line at the time when "by" was deleted. Beginning in the next line the edited text contains a phrase that is bound to leave readers even more puzzled: "raising the conditions of new appropriati&lt; ng &gt;ons &lt; new &gt; of lands" (338.18-19). One can of course read the final text here; but if one wishes to know how it read earlier, one cannot simply add the bracketed letters, because no indication has been given of what words or letters were added at the time when the bracketed material was canceled. The manuscript shows that Jefferson first wrote "conditions of appropriating lands." After this "of" the word "new" is careted in; "on" is written over the "ng" and followed by "s"; and after that another caret points to "new of" with the "new" marked out. Thus Jefferson first revised his wording to "conditions of appropriating new lands"; then he further altered it to "conditions of new appropriations of lands." These examples are enough to show that the system is inadequate; reporting cancellations in this way serves little purpose because it does not provide enough information to allow one to reconstruct the stages of revision. 26 What I have been saying about the textual policy of the Jefferson edition is not meant to cast doubt on the accomplishment of this edition in other respects. It is surely a great achievement in its assemblage and arrangement of material, its exemplary historical annotation, and its generally efficient physical presentation (with each document followed by concise descriptive, explanatory, and—in some cases—textual notes). And it deserves to be praised for the role it has played in causing serious scholarly attention to be turned to the full-scale editing of important statesmen's papers—it has eloquently demonstrated why the scholarly editor must place "the exacting claims of history" above "the amenities and a respect for the privacy and feelings of individuals" (p. xxviii). What is to be regretted is that an edition in such a strategic position of influence is so unsophisticated in its handling of the actual text. There is no single right way to edit a text, but the editorial policy of the Jefferson edition does not suggest that the alternatives have been clearly thought through. As a result, there is indecision as to whether the text is to be literal or critical, whether it is to be modernized or unmodernized, and whether it is to incorporate apparatus or have the apparatus appended. The reason given for retaining "&amp;c." is that "it was widely used in eighteenth-century printing" (p. xxxi), but Jefferson's "&amp;" is expanded in ordinary documents to "and," presumably because it would not have appeared in an eighteenth-century printed version. Yet, as Boyd recognizes, an editor cannot undertake to capitalize various nouns for Jefferson, even though Jefferson's "extreme economy" in the use of capitals was a matter in which he "differed from his contemporaries" (p. xxx). Is the question of how a given letter or private note would have appeared in print in the eighteenth century even a relevant one, when such documents were not intended for print? The way Jefferson wrote them, however unconventional it may have been, is what the reader is interested in. This view prevails part of the time, since the editor has thought it worthwhile to transcribe the major documents literally. But at other times there seems to be a feeling that formal matters are really not important and that a partially "conventionalized" rendering is all the reader needs. The statement of editorial method, in short, reflects no coherent textual rationale. Two years later Clarence E. Carter published Historical Editing (1952), a 51-page pamphlet which in some ways is the counterpart, for the historical field, of the CEAA's Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (1967, 1972). Although it was not meant to be an official statement of the NHPC (as the CEAA's pamphlet was a committee position paper), it was published as Bulletin No. 7 of the National Archives and was written by a man with extensive editorial experience in connection with a government project, The Territorial Papers of the United States (1934- ). Unlike the CEAA's pamphlet, which emphasizes printed texts and devotes most of its space to discussion of textual matters, Carter's booklet deals with manuscript texts and spends only ten pages on textual questions. Carter refers favorably to Boyd's work early in his discussion (pp. 10-11), but it is clear that Carter's position is more conservative than Boyd's and that he places a higher value on the formal aspects of a text. Carter begins his account of "Textual Criticism" (pp. 20-25) with the problem of establishing the authenticity of a document, and then he turns to "the operation designed to clear up such corruptions as may have entered it" (p. 23). This statement suggests that the kind of edited text which Carter envisions is a critical one, not an exact transcription. The matter soon becomes less clear, however. Although he admits that originals may contain errors, he discusses emendations only in regard to copies. He implies that originals are not to be emended, because even in the copy retained by the writer "no editorial emendations are permissible": "it is an official record, and the only resort is to call attention to the presence of specific errors" (p. 24). A copy made by someone else, in contrast, may be emended—but whether silently or not is uncertain. "Conjectural emendations," he says, "are recommended only when it is clear that the errors are due to the inadvertence of the scribe." But, he goes on, "such emendations should be plainly identified as such in footnotes or by editorial brackets in the text" (p. 23). Yet on the next page he says that "slips of the pen" by the copyist can be corrected by "unidentified emendations." Apparently the second category is meant to consist of obvious errors, such as "the transposition of letters in words, or the repetition of words or lines," and the first of less obvious errors. But such a distinction is not definite enough to provide a workable basis for deciding which emendations are to be silent. There is a curious mixture here of strictness and leniency: nothing, not even errors, can be altered in a text from a document in the author's hand; but scribal copies can be emended, sometimes silently. This mixture also reflects an indecision similar to Boyd's about the nature of the editor's task—whether it is to produce an exact transcription of a surviving document or a critical text not identical with the text in any single extant document. The issue emerges squarely in Carter's paragraph on "the occasional needs to reconstruct a document when two or more textual versions are encountered, each of which possesses attributes which stamp it as authentic" (p. 24). The word "reconstruct" suggests the production of an emended text; but his "harmonizing of the various versions" amounts to "the choice of the one which seems to be the most complete one of chronological priority," with readings from the other versions placed in brackets or in footnotes. 27 Carter says nothing further about emendation but instead turns to "Transcription" (pp. 25-30), where the emphasis is clearly on what he calls "exact copy." His comments are based on a thorough understanding of the value of retaining the original punctuation and spelling; he cites some useful examples illustrating the importance of punctuation in official documents (p. 26) and notes that the "interest in bad spelling lies partially in that it indicates the current pronunciation" (p. 28). 28 He believes that superscript letters, ligatures, abbreviations, date-lines, addresses, signatures, and the like should all be reproduced exactly. 29 Canceled matter, he says, can be inserted into the text, appropriately marked, or reported in notes—but not simply ignored. To eliminate these passages, as he rightly points out, "omits an element that often indicates what was actually passing through the mind of the writer which he concluded not to set down, and of course it also represents carelessness in many instances—a not unimportant facet of a writer's character" (p. 29). Carter's discussion of "Transcription," taken by itself, sets forth an intelligent and well-considered approach, which is admirably put in practice in his own work on The Territorial Papers (commented on further below). Although he stresses objectivity here and throughout, he is aware that subjective judgment enters into transcription. When a mark of punctuation is not clearly identifiable, for instance, "it becomes the editor's responsibility to determine from the sense of the passage what was probably intended, and to proceed accordingly" (p. 26). This view is more realistic than the one expressed at the end of the preceding section, where he says that "the editor must eschew any and all forms of interpretation; he cannot deal with his documents in a subjective manner" (p. 25). What he is primarily getting at in this earlier statement is that the editor should not interpret the facts presented in his text, leaving that task for "the historian who uses the edited documents as a basis of historical composition." He is adamant on this point: "It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the editor's sole responsibility, after having established the purity of the documents, is to reproduce them with meticulous accuracy." Despite his insistence, the issue is not so easily settled, for it can be argued that the editor, having thought deeply about the text, is in the best position to suggest interpretations of it in his annotation. In any case, this question does not affect texual policy. But Carter does not perhaps sufficiently recognize the extent to which judgment inevitably enters the editorial process, especially when emendation is allowed. His discussion, like many others in the historical field, neglects printed texts and (perhaps partly for that reason) fails to confront adequately the issues involved in an editor's decision to produce a critical text; the issues are present even when the only choice for copy-text is a holograph letter, but they may call themselves more forcibly to the editor's attention when he has more occasion to deal with multiple versions of a text. Nevertheless, Carter's comments are generally sensible, as far as they go, and he at least takes notice of—if he does not fully pursue—the problems of choosing a copy-text when one is faced with several copies, none of which is in the author's hand, or with multiple possibly authoritative texts. Certainly his views on punctuation and spelling and on the necessity for recording variants deserve to be heeded more than they have been. A third influential statement on historical editing was published two years after Carter's, in the Harvard Guide to American History (ed. Oscar Handlin et al. , 1954)—which contained a short section on "The Editing and Printing of Manuscripts" (pp. 95-104), prepared primarily by Samuel Eliot Morison. Because of the wide circulation which the Guide has achieved, a great many people have been exposed to this discussion, and it has often been referred to in historical literature as a standard account of editing. When the Guide was revised in 1974 (ed. Frank Freidel et al. ), the editors apparently saw no need to alter this section, for it was retained in practically identical form ("Editing and Printing," pp. 27-36). 30 Yet it is a superficial treatment of editing which, like Boyd's and Carter's, oversimplifies or fails to touch basic questions which any editor must consider. The discussion attempts "to set forth general principles of editing American documents" and begins with the usual point that "printing is unable to reproduce a longhand manuscript exactly." But from there on, difficulties arise. Three methods of preparing texts are announced—called the Literal, the Expanded, and the Modernized—and a preliminary section offers directions that apply to all three. Some of these directions are overly precise and unnecessary—such as specifying that a salutation should be printed in small capitals or that the date line, regardless of where it appears in the original, should consistently be "printed either in italics under the heading, or at the end" (I.2). What such directions do reveal is that some silent alterations of the original are to be allowed—even in the Literal Method, since these directions apply to all the methods. Three other preliminary directions indicate further—and more objectionable—silent alterations. When a manuscript is torn or illegible, editorial comments are to be inserted in italics within brackets and conjectured readings in roman type within brackets, as Boyd recommended; but, unlike Boyd, the Guide claims that "if only one to four letters [of a long word] are missing, brackets are unnecessary and pedantic" (I.3)—on the grounds that the editor can be sure in those cases of what had originally been written. Yet obviously one cannot really be certain what spelling was used; not to indicate in some way what the editor has done misrepresents the surviving evidence by offering as a fact what is actually an inference. 31 Another direction calls for inserting "[ sic ]" after "a very strange spelling or mistake of the original writer" (I.5), implying that mistakes are not to be emended. yet the same direction states, "One may correct, without notice, obvious slips of the writer's pen such as 'an an hour ago.'" As in Carter's discussion, nothing explicit is said about what distinguishes errors to be silently corrected from those to be retained. The two categories in fact represent very different approaches to editing, and their juxtaposition here requires further explanation. Still another direction, dealing with manuscript alterations, asserts that "canceled passages are omitted unless they contain something of particular interest, when they may be inserted in a footnote" (I.7). No discussion of what value canceled passages may have is given, nor of what might cause some to be of particular interest; if the point had been taken up and analyzed, the difficulty of regarding any cancellations in a letter or journal as insignificant would have become apparent. 32 The subsection on the Literal Method begins with the statement, "Follow the manuscript absolutely in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation"—unaccompanied by an explanation of how this directive is consistent with such earlier rules, applicable to all methods, as the one permitting silent corrections of slips of the pen. And it is immediately followed by a troublesome exception: "in very illiterate manuscripts, where little or no punctuation is used, a minimum necessary to understand the text may be supplied; and in documents where the writer begins practically every word with a capital, the editor may use his discretion" (II.1). Although the editor is told that he should state "the practice followed" in a preliminary note, there is no requirement for him to record his alterations. Obviously the point of a literal method is to reproduce the text of a document exactly as it stands; if a manuscript is "illiterate," the reader of a literal text of it will expect to see the characteristics that make it illiterate. There is no logic in setting up a category called "Literal Method" and then saying that an editor can, in extreme cases, make changes for the convenience of the reader and still produce a literal text. Even if there were really much difficulty in reading a text in which most words are capitalized, the ease of readibility is not a criterion for a literal text. A few changes, of purely typographic significance, can be defended in a literal text, such as the elimination of the long "s"—a literal text, after all, is to be distinguished from a type-facsimile. Manuscript abbreviations, however, constitute a difficult category: one would expect an abbreviation to be reproduced, not expanded, in a literal text, and yet some abbreviations would require specially cast types to be printed. The rule given here is to print abbreviations and contractions "exactly as written within the limitations of available type " (II.4) and otherwise to expand them without brackets (II.5). This procedure is defensible as a practical compromise; but unfortunately the impression is given that an editor need not explain exactly what he has altered in this respect. For the so-called Expanded Method, taken up next, the Guide recommends Boyd's practice, though it prefers more expansion of abbreviations and more standardization of designations for money, weights, and measures. In fact, most of the discussion is concerned with the treatment of abbreviations, the general policy being to "spell out all abbreviations except those still used today . . . and those of months, proper names, and titles" (III.2). No rationale is given for the aims of the Expanded Method, but since the goal is not to produce a modernized text (that is the subject of the third method) it is not clear why the present-day currency of an abbreviation is relevant. Nor is it clear just what changes are to be made silently. All sentences are to begin with a capital and end with a period, "no matter what the writer does" (III.1); these changes and most expansions of abbreviations are apparently to be made without comment, but supplied letters which follow the last one in a superscript abbreviation are, inexplicably, to be enclosed in brackets ("m°" becomes "mo[nth]"). Except for the treatment of the opening and closing of sentences, the original capitalization and punctuation are to be retained (III.1), and the spelling as well, even if inconsistent (III.5); the point in standardizing the money, weight, and measure designations, therefore, becomes less clear by contrast. 33 Indeed, the point of the Expanded Method as a whole is puzzling. It is not, as one might at first suppose of an emended but unmodernized text, to correct errors, nor is it to produce consistency, except in a few minor respects; it is simply, as the name indicates, to expand some of the abbreviations. But this expansion does not really constitute a separate "method"; it is more accurately regarded as a form of annotation. One could just as well have a literal text with the explanations of the abbreviations in brackets or notes; indeed, such a procedure would be preferable to the uncertainties suggested here. If the Expanded Method were truly a different method of editing, it would have to involve a basically different approach to the text—a critical approach, for instance, in which the text is emended to correct errors and resolve cruxes. Despite the confusions of the section on the Expanded Method, it ends with a salutary caution: Some editors begin every new sentence with a capital letter, even if the writer does not. This is unobjectionable if it is clear where the writer intended a new sentence to begin; but often it is not clear. Punctuation in all manuscripts before the nineteenth century is highly irregular; and if you once start replacing dashes by commas, semicolons, or periods, as the sense may seem to warrant, you are asking for trouble. (III.6) Ironically this closing statement, which contradicts the opening point of the section ("always capitalize the first word and put a period at the end of the sentence no matter what the writer does"), is the most sensible one in the whole discussion. 34 The subsection on the Modernized Method requires little comment. Modernization is said to be for "the average reader who is put off by obsolete spelling and erratic punctuation." The extent to which the average reader is "put off" by such features of a text is probably not so great as many editors seem to think. In any case, the modernization recommended here is a confused concept. The first direction is the expected one: "Modernize the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, but pay scrupulous respect to the language" (IV.1)—although one might not expect the additional statement, "Paragraphs and sentences that are too long may be broken up." What is confusing, however, is that the same instruction also contains this sentence: "Where the original writer has obviously omitted a word like not , or, for instance, has written east when you know he means west , the editor may add or correct a word; but he should place it within square brackets." The correction of errors is an entirely separate matter from modernization, and the two should not be linked together here as aspects of the same "method." One can modernize a text without correcting errors, and one can emend without modernizing. An introduction to editorial method which does not make this distinction will only encourage illogical thinking. The confusions which underlie the Guide 's whole discussion are epitomized in the concluding remarks on "Choice of Method" (VI). The choice is said to depend "partly on the kind of document in question, but mainly on practical considerations, especially on the purpose of the publication." The nature of the document does determine whether expansion of abbreviations or modernization is required, once it has been decided that the edition is aimed at an audience which would require such alterations; but that decision comes first, since for some purposes only the literal approach will suffice, regardless of the complexities of the document. To say that documents of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries "full of contractions" should be printed literally "in a publication destined for scholarly readers only" is both to underestimate the capacities of a wider audience and to ignore completely the possibility of accompanying a literal text with textual annotation. But why anyone, scholar or not, needs an unmodernized text does not seem to be fully grasped: an expanded text is said to be better for the student than a modernized one "because the wording, spelling, and punctuation of the original give it a certain flavor"—a statement suggesting only a trivial interest in these matters (and again including "wording" as one of the concerns of modernization). The assertion that "for a new edition of some classic such as the Virginia 'Lament for Mr. Nathaniel Bacon,' or the poetry of Edward Taylor, the Modernized Method is best" shows a complete failure to understand the serious reasons for being interested in spelling and punctuation and implies that those features are of less concern in "literary" than in "historical" documents. (An earlier similar comment claims that the "texts of recent editions of Shakespeare, Dryden, and the King James Bible have been established by this [modernized] method"—as if modernizing could "establish" a text, instead of being a way of altering a text, once established.) 35 The motto offered at the end of the section is in the spirit of the rest of the discussion: "Accuracy without Pedantry. / Consistency first, last, and always." The accuracy required for establishing a text may be regarded as pedantry by some, without affecting its desirability, and what excessive accuracy might be is not defined. If consistency of editorial treatment is the prime virtue, then surely a logical consistency of editorial rationale is a necessity; the Guide in this respect sets a poor example. 36 These three statements of editorial method were not the only ones available to historical editors of the 1950s and 1960s. Thirty years earlier, for instance, the Anglo-American Historical Committee produced a two-part "Report" 37 —the first dealing with medieval and the second with modern documents—which was in many ways an intelligent and carefully considered statement. Unfortunately it recommended modernizing punctuation for all documents; 38 but, unlike some later treatments, it recognized the importance of recording cancellations and revisions and of providing a detailed account of the practice of the manuscript text in any respect in which the editor alters it. 39 Boyd, Carter, and the Harvard Guide , however, are more important for anyone examining the NHPRC editions. Boyd's edition led the way for the later editions and was taken as a model, and the other two discussions followed in quick succession at a time when some of the later editions were being organized. The first and third especially have had a considerable influence on a large number of American editions, which either refer to them explicitly or are modeled on other editions that follow their recommendations. If that were not the case, they would hardly deserve the attention given them here; but their deficiencies have apparently not been regarded as obvious. The discussion in the Guide is the least satisfactory, as Carter's is the best, of the group; all three have serious shortcomings, but the one with the most merit ironically has been cited the least often. A recognition of the indecisiveness of these discussions— particularly the two most influential ones—in regard to editorial theory and procedure suggests what a weak foundation they provide for the massive superstructure later erected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II A brief survey of some of the historical editions which followed, beginning in 1959 with the Franklin, Calhoun, and Clay editions, will illustrate how similar their characteristic position is to that of one or more of the three statements of the early 1950s. 40 Leonard W. Labaree, in The Papers of Benjamin Franklin (Yale University Press, 1959- ), 41 sets out to follow "a middle course between exact reproduction . . . and complete modernization" (p. xl) 42 and cites the Harvard Guide for "a discussion of principles which the editors have in general followed." The aim is "to preserve as faithfully as possible the form and spirit in which the authors composed their documents, and at the same time to reproduce their words in a manner intelligible to the present-day reader." Insofar as the second aim involves alteration of the original, it would seem to be incompatible with the first. Labaree distinguishes his treatment of printed copy-texts from that of manuscript copy-texts. The former, he says, are "considered as having been edited once from an original manuscript" and therefore are presented as originally printed, except for the silent alteration of certain typographic conventions (italic proper names are made roman and words in full capitals are made lower case) and the silent correction of "obvious" errors (otherwise, "no attempt will be made to reconstruct the original version"). In manuscript copy-texts, however, contractions are expanded, periods are placed at the ends of sentences, and punctuation is altered in various other ways: "A dash used in place of a period, comma, or semicolon will be replaced by the appropriate mark of punctuation . . . Commas scattered meaninglessly through a sentence will be silently omitted" (p. xlii). These procedures leave the editor in the ironic position of treating printed texts—which are at least one step removed from the author's manuscript and may contain compositors' alterations—with greater respect than authorial manuscript texts, in which there is direct evidence of the author's practice. Furthermore, there is no recognition of the fact that printed texts may vary from copy to copy or that manuscript texts may be of a kind that were never intended for publication. The idea that a printed copy-text has already "been edited once" and thus requires less alteration implies that the scholarly editor's function, like that of the printing- or publishing-house editor, is to put a text—regardless of its nature—in "publishable" shape. But, as Labaree knows, a scholar is interested in the "form and spirit" of Franklin himself; and most of the silent changes described here can only take one farther away from him. Part of the texture of contemporary detail is sacrificed for the sake of a supposedly more readable text, though many of the deleted features would not have caused a reader any real difficulties in the first place. One must wonder why, if a partially modernized text of Franklin had to be produced, it could not have been accompanied by a record of editorial alterations. 43 The same year, in The Papers of John C. Calhoun (University of South Carolina Press, 1959- ), Robert L. Meriwether took a different position from Labaree, arguing that printed texts could be treated more freely than manuscript texts because Calhoun was not responsible for printed reports of speeches and the like; yet the freedom employed— involving the silent revision of capitalization and punctuation and the breaking up of paragraphs—seems excessive, especially in view of the fact that Calhoun probably revised the reporter's accounts in some cases (p. xxxv). In manuscript texts, the editor does not allow Calhoun to employ two marks of punctuation together (one is chosen), and dashes at the ends of sentences are silently changed to periods. The most confusing device in this edition is the use of roman type in square brackets to represent both editorial restorations and authorial cancellations. W. Edwin Hemphill, taking over with the second volume (1963), makes explicit reference to the Expanded Method of the Harvard Guide (p. xxvii). By contrast, The Papers of Henry Clay (University of Kentucky Press, 1959— ), edited by James F. Hopkins, 44 says little about editorial method and nothing about punctuation, except that the lowering of superscript letters sometimes affects the punctuation. Presumably punctuation is otherwise unaltered, and the "original spelling and capitalization have been retained" (p. ix), so that this edition may come closer to offering a literal treatment than the others of 1959—although "typographical errors" in printed texts are silently corrected. The problem of variant texts, frequently slighted in historical editions, is at least commented on here: "When several contemporary copies, but not the original letter of delivery, have been discovered, that which most closely approximates the form identified with the sender has been used. When there are several versions of a manuscript in the inscriber's hand, that which most closely represents his final intent has been accepted." This statement shows no awareness of the intricacies of textual criticism. The first sentence does not recognize the possibility of constructing an "eclectic" text; it assumes that the task is to edit a single document, not the text which is found embodied in several documents. Yet when errors in a printed copy are silently corrected, the editor is concerning himself with an idealized text rather than with the reproduction of a specific embodiment of the text; the principle that is recognized in handling a printed text is not extended to situations involving scribal copies, though both may obviously contain departures from the author's manuscript. And the second sentence does not suggest the difficulties of determining "final intent" or the importance of variant readings among the holograph drafts. In 1961 two more large editions began publication. One was The Adams Papers (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press)—which, like the Jefferson and Franklin editions, had been designated a priority project by the NHPC. 45 Lyman H. Butterfield, describing his editorial method in the first volume of The Diary and Autobiography of John Adams , praises those other two editions, and it is clear that his procedures closely resemble those of the Jefferson edition (with which he had earlier been associated). 46 He aims at a "middle ground between pedantic fidelity and readability" (p. lvi) and adds that scholars who are "concerned with the ultimate niceties of a critical passage" can "resort" to the microfilm edition of the Adams papers. 47 It is true that the availability of the papers on microfilm makes it earsier for a scholar to check readings in the manuscripts, but that fact has no bearing on the editor's responsibility for producing a sound text in a letterpress edition. The reason for undertaking a letterpress edition of material available on microfilm is not simply to offer a more readable (that is, partly modernized) text; it is to furnish readers with a text which has benefited from the editor's critical thinking about what the writer meant to have in that text. 48 Of course, a scholar under any circumstances may wish to consult the original manuscripts (just as he might wish to check on any other documentation); but to justify silent alterations in a printed text on the grounds that a scholar can always look at the manuscripts is to conceive of editing as little more than styling for present-day readability. In addition, the discussion suggests that only a few scholars will be interested in such matters as punctuation and even takes a disparaging tone toward anyone concerned with them. Rather than counting on the reader's agreement that it is "pedantic" to be interested in the "ultimate niceties" of a text, it would be more positive and productive to assume that readers will want to understand the text as fully as they can and will not wish to slight any aspect of it in the process. As with many other historical editions, the determination here not to emend from a variant text is in odd contrast to the leniency with which the selected text is handled. Relevant texts are collated and "significant" differences are recorded; however, Butterfield says, "Whatever version is found in the manuscripts being edited has perforce been considered the 'basic' text in the present volume" (p. lix). Two years later, in the opening volume of Adams Family Correspondence , a supplementary editorial discussion marks a notable departure from this practice: the comparison of copies, it is said, can call attention to clarifications of grammar, corrections of spelling, and the like, and such changes are adopted silently (p. xlv). The fact that their immediate source is another document makes this an "eclectic" procedure, and the statement is a welcome recognition of the possibility of editing a text rather than a document. The Adams edition, unlike many of the literary editions of published works, does not fully carry this approach through; but it has gone farther than most of the historical editions in enunciating the principle on which the establishment of critical texts rests. 49 The other edition beginning in 1961, The Papers of Alexander Hamilton (Columbia University Press), edited by Harold C. Syrett, 50 places even more stress on modernization: not only are punctuation and capitalization altered "where it seemed necessary to make clear the sense of the writer" but a "special effort has been made to eliminate the dash, which was such a popular eighteenth-century device" (p. xvii). The reader is at more of a loss than usual to know what the editor has done, because "unintentional slips" are handled in one of four ways (they are allowed to stand, explained in a note, corrected with bracketed insertions, or corrected silently), but there is no discussion of the circumstances for choosing one method over another. Deletions are reported only when "the significance of a manuscript seems to warrant it," as is also the case in The Papers of James Madison (University of Chicago Press, 1962- ), edited by William T. Hutchinson and William M. E. Rachal (and, later, Robert A. Rutland). 51 Because Madison made some revisions in his papers long after they were written, the editors rightly feel that these later alterations should be distinguished from the earlier ones: "Changes which the editors believe that Madison made in later life, when looking back over his papers, are given in footnotes" (p. xxxvii). But since the determination of which revisions fall into this class rests on editorial judgment and since cancellations are not reported ordinarily, there is the possibility that in some instances Madison's later revisions have been incorporated into the text, with no record of canceled readings to call attention to the potential problem. Donald Jackson's edition, the same year, of the Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with Related Documents, 1783-1854 (University of Illinois Press, 1962), is again a partly modernized edition: "When in doubt as to how to proceed in a trivial matter I silently follow modern practice." He employs identical policies in two later editions, The Journals of Zebulon Montgomery Pike (University of Oklahoma Press, 1966- ) and The Expeditions of John Charles Frémont (edited with Mary Lee Spence; University of Illinois Press, 1970- ). Like many of his fellow editors, he insists on normalizing the end-punctuation of sentences and eliminating superfluous dashes. 52 He is also characteristic in neglecting the possibility of authoritative variants in printed texts; as he says in the Frémont , "Material taken from printed texts is so indicated . . . but no attempt is made to record other printed versions." His departures from his copy-texts are in general said to be "based on common sense and the current practice of scholars." Whether that current practice is in turn based on a coherent and defensible editorial rationale is not inquired into; practices which are current tend to become self-perpetuating by inspiring uncritical acceptance. 53 Some of the other editions of the late 1960s follow the same path. The goal of The Papers of Henry Laurens (University of South Carolina Press, 1968- ), edited by Philip M. Hamer (and, later, George C. Rogers, Jr.), 54 is to follow "with some deviations" the Expanded Method of the Harvard Guide . Although the object is "not only an accurate but a readable text," the word "accurate" here cannot refer to punctuation, and modernization seems to take first place: "The flavor of the eighteenth century . . . has been maintained where clarity would not be sacrificed" (p. xxxi). The editorial function is conceived of as the accurate conveyance of "meaning" rather than of a text: "Superfluous commas may be omitted or reduced in number, and commas will be added when they will assist the reader, but no punctuation will be changed unless it is clear to the editors that no change of meaning will result." What is clear to one informed person, of course, may not be so to another, and it is debatable whether the "readability" gained is worth the price of not knowing what is in the original; reporting the evidence would not settle the question whether modernization is desirable, but it would make the situation more tolerable. The Correspondence of James K. Polk (Vanderbilt University Press, 1969- ), edited by Herbert Weaver, also modernizes for "clarity," including grammar in what can be altered. "These changes have generally been made silently," Weaver says, "rather than risk cluttering the pages with editorial props that divert attention from the meaning or spirit of the writers" (p. xii) 55 —though the alterations themselves have already done that to some extent. Not all the editions of the late 1960s, however, conform to the prevailing pattern. One is pleasantly surprised to find that Arthur S. Link's edition of The Papers of Woodrow Wilson (Princeton University Press, 1966- ) 56 makes very few—and clearly defined—silent emendations (such as lowering superscript letters and replacing dashes with periods at the ends of sentences); otherwise, each document is "reproduced exactly as it appears in the original" (p. xvi), with any change marked by brackets (and deleted matter reported in angle brackets). It is true that the changes are made "for the sake of clarity," as in the other editions, but here the reader knows where they occur. Similarly, LeRoy P. Graf and Ralph W. Haskins, in The Papers of Andrew Johnson (University of Tennessee Press, 1967- ), 57 make no changes of spelling or punctuation without using brackets (and apparently the only alteration of punctuation is the insertion of bracketed periods), although they add in the second volume (1970) that slips of the pen are eliminated. A third edition of these years, John Y. Simon's edition of The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant (Southern Illinois University Press, 1967- ), 58 is particularly commendable. It can state flatly that "None of Grant's spelling, grammar, or punctuation has been altered" (p. xxxi), and it reports deletions in canceled type. Most of the historical editions which followed in the 1970s unfortunately did not imitate these three editions but continued in the familiar pattern of partial modernization and selective recording of evidence. Robert A. Rutland's edition of The Papers of George Mason (University of North Carolina Press, 1970) states that it is following Boyd's Jefferson ; while it retains inconsistent spellings, it silently regularizes the punctuation of sentence-endings, reduces Mason's capitalized pronouns to lower case, and inserts periods "in place of many a semicolon or colon that the writer obviously intended to function as a break rather than a pause" (p. xxii). Haskell M. Monroe, Jr., and James T. McIntosh, in The Papers of Jefferson Davis (Louisiana State University Press, 1971- ) also silently emend punctuation according to modern standards, sometimes "correcting" a colon to a comma or a period; but, oddly, they do not insert what they regard as needed punctuation where no punctuation is present in the manuscript, representing the lack instead by an extended space. The Papers of Joseph Henry (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1972- ), edited by Nathan Reingold, takes the Adams edition as its model and incorporates canceled matter in angle brackets if of "historical, psychological, or stylistic significance" (it is hard to see how any canceled matter could be eliminated on these grounds). Although punctuation and spelling are said to be "usually faithfully preserved," "ubiquitous dashes are converted to modern commas and periods, and a few commas and periods are inserted silently where absolutely necessary for clear understanding" (p. xxxv). Louis R. Harlan, in the second volume (1972) of The Booker T. Washington Papers (University of Illinois Press, 1972- ), 59 describes his policy of silently correcting "typed and printed errors" and regularizing some punctuation, "except in semi-literate letters, which are reproduced exactly as written in order to avoid an inordinate amount of editorial intrusion into the document." A more valid reason for printing them as written is that the documents are more revealing unemended—an argument which could be applied to a much wider range of material. The first volume of this edition, containing Washington's published autobiographical writings, illustrates the way in which editors who primarily work with single manuscript texts sometimes fail to report adequately on multiple printed texts. Harlan's brief textual comment on Up from Slavery , for instance, merely says that the first book edition is used as copy-text in preference to the serialization in the Outlook because the magazine "did not include all that later appeared in the book version" and because "Negro" is spelled with a capital, as Washington wanted it, in the book but not in the magazine. Nothing is said to characterize the material added to the book or to explain the relation of the book text in other respects to that of the magazine, and no lising of variants is provided. The two texts do differ occasionally in punctuation and spelling ("coloured" in the book vs. "colored" in the magazine, for example), but the question of which text better reflects Washington's practice in these respects is never addressed. In E. James Ferguson's The Papers of Robert Morris (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1973- ), slips of the pen and "casual or incorrect punctuation" (p. xxxiv) are corrected: "Dashes and commas randomly distributed in the manuscripts are silently removed." Herbert A. Johnson's The Papers of John Marshall (University of North Carolina Press, 1974- ) also silently emends some punctuation but interestingly confuses the author's intention with standards of correctness for a published work: sentences are supplied with opening capitals and closing periods "as necessary to preserve the original intention of the writer" (p. xxxvi). Apparently printed texts are reproduced with greater fidelity than manuscript texts, if that is what is meant by saying that dashes at the ends of sentences are "silently omitted from documents other than those that reproduce a previous imprint." In other respects punctuation is not emended silently, for Johnson recognizes "the uncertainties involved in correcting any given writer's use of the comma." He very sensibly continues, "Should considerations of clarity dictate some explanatory insertion, the editors have added punctuation in square brackets, thereby permitting the reader to reach his own decision concerning the propriety of the editorial decision." 60 The Papers of Daniel Webster (University Press of New England, 1974- ), edited by Charles M. Wiltse, 61 is similarly cautious about silent changes and makes none except to replace the dashes "intended" as periods; it is careful to retain misspellings and abbreviations or to alter them only in brackets. Merrill Jensen's two recent editions, however, go to the opposite extreme: both The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections, 1788-1790 (with Robert A. Becker; University of Wisconsin Press, 1976- ) and The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution (State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1976- ) 62 remove capitals and italics "except when they are evidently used by the author for emphasis," add punctuation "if needed to clarify meaning," and modernize spelling except for personal names (p. xvi); although official documents and a few others are given in a literal text, other printed texts are emended to eliminate certain eighteenth-century practices, "except when capital letters and italics were evidently used for emphasis by the author or the printer." Enough has been said to show the characteristic textual practices of the NHPRC editions and other editions modeled on them. But I do not wish to imply that "historical" editions are the only ones which have indulged in partial modernization and selective reporting of emendations and have in general taken a superficial view of textual matters. A number of editions of the letters of literary figures—not particularly influenced by the modern practice of historians—are equally unsatisfactory. The influence, in fact, may go the other way, because The Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's Correspondence (Yale University Press, 1937- ), edited by Wilmarth S. Lewis, 63 was the first of the modern large-scale editions of a single figure and has been cited as an influential force in some of the historical accounts of the NHPRC editions. 64 Lewis did set a good example in his thorough explanatory annotation and in his careful headnote to each letter giving details about the manuscript. His treatment of the text, however, raises some questions. Although he indicates, with brackets, emendations of words, he makes numerous silent emendations of punctuation and spelling. The policy is to retain Walpole's punctuation (but not that of his correspondents) and his spelling of proper names, but "to normalize other spellings and capitalization." One of the justifications offered is "a considerable gain in readability and appearance." The "considerable" is debatable, but readability is at any rate the standard argument for modernization—although the question remains why thorough modernization is not therefore undertaken to make the text even more readable. Another justification is more troublesome: "What is amusing and 'flavoursome' in small doses becomes wearisome in large, and it imparts an air of quaintness to a text which was not apparent to the correspondents themselves" (p. xxxvi). Surely no serious reader will regard any characteristics of a particular time in history as merely quaint; all characteristics are part of the evidence for historical understanding, and it is an insult to the reader to suggest that he can better perceive the intended tone of a letter if certain features of it have been altered for him. Similar problems arise in many other literary editions. Theodore Besterman's edition of Voltaire's Correspondence (Institut et Musée Voltaire, 1953-65) 65 is famous because of its enormous size; the completion of an edition of 21,000 letters is indeed an accomplishment, to say nothing of bringing it out a second time in a revised "definitive edition" ( Correspondence and Related Documents , 1968-76). Although Voltaire's alterations are recorded in notes, the treatment of the main text is disappointing: the first edition reports that apostrophes are inserted and "a minimum of capital letters and punctuation, where lacking" (p. xiii), and the revised edition follows the same policy (pp. xvii-xviii; Besterman says, "without attempting to modernize, I have introduced a measure of regularity"). The edition offers an example of the kind of inconsistency which partial modernization almost invariably leads to: "When Voltaire used an accent it has been reproduced even if it now looks wrong, but when he omitted one it has been supplied." 66 Gordon S. Haight, in The George Eliot Letters (Yale University Press, 1954-55), says that his "principal concern has been the reader's convenience" (p. xxxv); though he retains spelling, he treats punctuation "a little more freely, adding or deleting an occasional mark to save rereading." In the same year Allan Wade, in The Letters of W. B. Yeats (Hart-Davis, 1954), argues for "correcting" both spelling and punctuation on the grounds that Yeats was poor at both. To retain Yeats's spelling would "in the long run appear merely tediously pedantic" (p. 16); Yeats's "faults" in punctuation, he says, "I have silently corrected, and I have not hesitated to introduce commas into sentences which, without them, are either ambiguous or almost meaningless" (p. 17)—obviously running the risk of giving those sentences meanings which Yeats did not intend. E. S. de Beer does not attempt to normalize punctuation in The Diary of John Evelyn (Clarendon Press, 1955) but does supply "without note a certain amount of punctuation" aimed "solely at intelligibility," arguing that for "strict linguistic study" one must consult the manuscripts (p. 68). In The Swinburne Letters (Yale University Press, 1959-62), Cecil Y. Lang says, "I have always tried to make readability my first concern" (p. xlix), and he follows the practice of reproducing printed texts "faithfully" but making some alterations in manuscript texts. The same approach continues to appear in literary editions of the 1960s and 1970s. Harry T. Moore, in The Collected Letters of D. H. Lawrence (Heinemann, 1962), comments on some of Lawrence's seeming deficiencies of punctuation and states, "rather than belabour the reader by calling attention to these peccadilloes I have quietly done what was needed" (p. xxi). Rupert Hart-Davis silently emends spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and paragraphing in The Letters of Oscar Wilde (Hart-Davis, 1962). Wilde's habitual dashes, he says, "make the letters difficult to read, and I have re-punctuated normally as the sense seems to demand" (p. xi). Wilde also liked to capitalize words beginning with "t" and "h," "presumably because he enjoyed making those particular capitals more than their lower-case equivalents." Hart-Davis believes that "to perpetuate this whim would only irritate the reader," and he has "followed the standard usage wherever the capital clearly has no significance." But he has just told us what significance those two capitals have. Why should a writer not be allowed to indulge his "whims" in a letter? It is a perfect place for him to do so, because the text will not have to go through the hands of a publisher or a printer before reaching the intended audience. The Letters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1966- ), edited by Andrew Hilen, is like some of the NHPRC editions in silently correcting "mere slips" but not altering errors or variations in proper names. "Occasionally," Hilen says, "I have silently provided punctuation, or deleted it, in order to clarify meaning" (p. 13). Leon Edel, in the Henry James Letters (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1974- ), makes silent corrections "where they were obviously called for" (p. xxxv), but in the letters of the young James he retains "relevant misspellings" because "they are a part of the flavor of the letters." Unfortunately he does not extend this argument to the later letters. I do not wish to prolong this litany unnecessarily. I have merely tried to cite a sufficient number of examples to show that there is a considerable body of editors whose approach to the editing of letters and journals is in the spirit of the policies set forth in Boyd's Jefferson and the Harvard Guide . And it is by no means only the historians who fall into this group. While it is true that most of the NHPRC editions—with only a few exceptions—are of this type, there are certainly a great many literary editors whose practice coincides with that of the NHPRC editors. 67 Most of the editions mentioned are praiseworthy in many respects: most of them reflect thorough research and exemplary annotation. But their treatment of the actual texts is relatively casual and unsophisticated by comparison. It is clear, from this survey, that one widely followed approach to editing documents assumes that some modernization is essential and that a silently modernized or corrected text can serve most purposes of historical study. The assumption is made, however, without adequate consideration of the role which such features as spelling and punctuation play in private documents and the extent to which they constitute part of the total body of evidence that the historian needs to have at his disposal. What I have said about these editions can perhaps begin to indicate why their textual policies are bound to seem unsatisfactory to anyone who has given careful thought to textual matters and the nature of written communication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III At the time when Boyd's Jefferson was about to come out and the NHPC to be revitalized, there were some editions other than the Walpole which might have been turned to as models, and it is unfortunate that they did not have more influence at that strategic moment. The Walpole edition, because of the enormous size of the undertaking, may have seemed a closer parallel to the large editions which were projected to accommodate the masses of papers accumulated by statesmen; but certain smaller editions could have offered a sounder textual policy. Paget Toynbee and Leonard Whibley's three-volume edition of Correspondence of Thomas Gray (Clarendon Press, 1935), for instance, states, "The text is printed as Gray or his correspondents wrote it, with the spelling, punctuation, use of capitals, and abbreviations of the originals" (p. xxiii); and Ralph L. Rusk's six-volume edition of The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Columbia University Press, 1939) requires little space for an explanation of editorial policy, for Rusk says simply, "I have tried to print a literal text, with no interpolated corrections or apologies" (p. v). Gordon N. Ray's four-volume edition of The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray (Harvard University Press, 1945-46) is a model edition. Ray presents "a literal text" and is not bothered, as so many editors seem to be, by sentences which end with dashes rather than periods. In an admirable statement, he sums up why it is important to preserve in print the spelling and punctuation of the manuscripts: Thackeray, the most informal of letter writers, was a past master at shaping his sentences in the precise contour of his thoughts by oddities of punctuation and orthography and by whimsical distortions of words not unlike Swift's "little language" in the Journal to Stella . Not to reproduce these peculiarities faithfully would be to falsify the tone and blur the meaning of the letters. (p. lxxiii) Although the details which lead to this conclusion might have to be altered somewhat in the case of other writers, it is difficult to see how the conclusion itself could be improved upon as a guiding statement for all editors of letters. Another notable edition, which began to appear just after the first volume of the Jefferson but early enough that it could have been influential in the formative days of the new NHPC, is Elting E. Morison's eight-volume edition of The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt (Harvard University Press, 1951-54). The letters are "printed as written without further indication of Roosevelt's frequent and startling departures from the norm of accepted usage in spelling." Morison, like Ray, has given careful thought to the rationale for such a policy, and he makes an intelligent statement of the case: No doubt this will strike the readers, as it has from time to time struck the editors, as a piece of unnecessarily solemn scholarship. But it seemed simpler, and safer on the whole, to leave Roosevelt's own text untouched rather than to interfere from time to time to correct or alter words or phrases to conform to what must be, in some cases, assumed meanings. Also these letters may serve as interesting documents on causation, since they were written by the President to whom the mission of simplified spelling commended itself. (p. xix) Also during these years historical editors in particular should have been aware of the excellent example being set by Clarence E. Carter in his major project, The Territorial Papers of the United States (Government Printing Office, 1934- ); it was in 1956, in the introduction to the twenty-second volume, that he made an important statement of his aim of "literal reproduction." 68 Even more persuasively than in his Historical Editing , he pleads the case for an unmodernized text: in brief, the idiosyncrasies of both the writer and the age are preserved. To proceed otherwise would be to bypass certain significant facets of the cultural status of an earlier era as glimpsed in the character of the written record, which, it is submitted, equates with the bare facts of politics and wars as historical grist. (pp. viii-ix) Modernization, he rightly concludes, "tends to obscure rather than to clarify." Some literary editors, too, were commenting in the 1950s on the importance of exact transcription of letters and journals. R. W. Chapman, reproducing the manuscripts "as closely as typography admits" in his three-volume edition of The Letters of Samuel Johnson (Clarendon Press, 1952), points out the value of errors: I have preserved Johnson's occasional inadvertences, such as the omission or repetition of small words, partly because they furnish some indication of his state of health or his state of mind, partly because they show the sort of error to which he was prone and may therefore help us in judging the text of those letters of which the originals are lost. (p. viii) 69 Kathleen Coburn, at the beginning of The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Pantheon Books [later Princeton University Press], 1957- ), 70 agrees, stating that "Slips of the pen are respected, in conformity with the argument of Dr. Chapman in editing Johnson, that such things have their own interest and significance" (p. xxx), and she adds that Coleridge himself remarked on this point. 71 Howard Horsford, editing Melville's Journal of a Visit to Europe and the Levant (Princeton University Press, 1955), suggests the importance of precision in his careful descriptions of cancellations and his thorough discussion of the difficulties of Melville's handwriting. Hyder Edward Rollins, in The Letters of John Keats (Harvard University Press, 1958), notes that "Keats penned his sentences rapidly and spontaneously, not carefully and artfully" (p. 17), and therefore his "queer punctuation" and "occasional grammatical slips" are indicative and should not be rectified. And Thomas H. Johnson's edition of The Letters of Emily Dickinson (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1958) presents all holograph letters "in their verbatim form" (p. xxv), which involves many dashes. 72 With editions of this kind available to point the way, the NHPC editors of the late 1950s were unwise to turn in a different direction. In 1960 four editions appeared which, in their somewhat differing ways, represent the approaches followed by the best of the literary editions of the 1960s and 1970s. All are characterized by scrupulous reporting of details of the manuscripts, but what distinguishes a number of them from most earlier careful editions of manuscripts is a system—not unlike that long in use for printed copy-texts—whereby certain categories of emendation can be allowed in the text, with the original readings preserved in notes or lists. Henry Nash Smith and William M. Gibson's edition of Mark Twain-Howells Letters (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1960) involves no normalizing of punctuation or spelling, and it records significant cancellations. James Franklin Beard, in The Letters and Journals of James Fenimore Cooper (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1960-68), does alter some punctuation for clarity and amend some spellings, but these editorial alterations are recorded in footnotes (except for a few specific categories), 73 while "legible cancellations" are incorporated into the text within angle brackets. The text of Merrell R. Davis and William H. Gilman's edition of The Letters of Herman Melville (Yale University Press, 1960) also incorporates a few emendations of punctuation for clarity, but they are all listed in the meticulous textual notes at the end. These notes additionally include such details as foreshortened (hastily written) words: one can learn from them that what appears in the edited text as "thing," for example, resembles "thng" in the manuscript (merely misspelled words, of course, are not altered). Cancellations are all transcribed, either in the text (in angle brackets, along with braces for insertions) or in the textual notes. The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1960- ), edited by William H. Gilman et al. , goes farther in the use of symbols to record as much textual information as possible within the text. It aims to come "as close to a literatim transcription" as is feasible in print (p. xxxviii) and does indicate the stages of Emerson's revision with great precision; some categories of editorial alteration, here too, are not labeled in the text but are reported in textual notes at the end. The volumes of Emerson Journals which appeared after the CEAA emblem was instituted have received the emblem, and later CEAA editions of journals further illustrate the modern practice of the full recording of manuscript characteristics. Washington Irving's Journals and Notebooks (University of Wisconsin Press, 1969- ), as edited by Henry A. Pochmann et al. , 74 is uncompromisingly literal (it respects Irving's lowercase sentence openings, for example) and contains one of the most thorough discussions in print (pp. xix-xxvi) of the problems involved in exact transcription (amply demonstrating that the process is not mechanical). Claude M. Simpson's edition of The American Notebooks of Nathaniel Hawthorne (Ohio State University Press, 1972), as is usual with CEAA volumes, makes some emendations in the text but records them, as well as authorial alterations of the manuscript, in lists at the end. And Mark Twain's Notebooks &amp; Journals (University of California Press, 1975- ), as edited by Frederick Anderson et al. , offers an excellent discussion of editorial procedures (pp. 575-84) and is a model of how to combine the emendation of certain obvious errors (always listed at the end, accompanied by "doubtful readings") with the preservation of "the texture of autograph documents" (which contain "irregularities, inconsistencies, errors, and cancellations"). 75 These are not the only praiseworthy editions of letter and journals in the 1960s and 1970s, 76 and a few others deserve mention not simply for their high standards of literal transcription but for the cogency of their statements justifying that approach. Shelley and His Circle (Harvard University Press, 1961- ), edited from the holdings of the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library by Kenneth Neill Cameron (later by Donald H. Reiman), 77 surpasses all these other editions in its efforts to reproduce in type the features of manuscripts—printing careted material, for example, above the line and in smaller type. The aim is "the traditional one" of producing "a foundational text . . . from which other editors may depart as they wish," and the rationale is stated with great effectiveness: There is, moreover, it seems to us, aside from the question of accuracy of representation a positive value in this traditional method which is insufficiently stressed. Changes, no matter how trivial, take the reader one remove from the author. An author's own punctuation, his cancellations and interlineations, even his misspellings, play a part in expressing mood or personality. Retained, they make a text no more difficult to read than an everyday letter from a friend. And even if an occasional passage could be made clearer by changing it, such exceptions are not, in our opinion, balanced by the total loss. (p. xxxiv) Herbert M. Schueller and Robert L. Peters, in their edition of The Letters of John Addington Symonds (Wayne State University Press, 1967-69), give some additional reasons for offering a literal text: We know that sometimes a quiet changing of manuscripts meets with approval; this practice, however, seems indefensible with respect to Symonds because, 1) the letters were not edited by him for publication, 2) they extend over his whole lifetime and show the influences of maturity on his personal expression, 3) the continuing characteristics are often Victorian practices rather than personal idiosyncrasies, and 4) to make deliberate changes in the originals is to go beyond the prerogatives even of editors. (p. 14) In The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Clarendon Press, 1972- ), Joyce Hemlow 78 allows errors to stand "as the normal hazards of hasty or spontaneous writing" and believes that "the twentieth-century reader probably needs few such props" as modernization (p. lviii). Leslie A. Marchand, in his editorial introduction to " In my hot youth": Byron's Letters and Journals (Murray, 1973- ), adds further to the strength of the case: Byron's punctuation follows no rules of his own or others' making. He used dashes and commas freely, but for no apparent reason, other than possibly for natural pause between phrases, or sometimes for emphasis. He is guilty of the "comma splice", and one can seldom be sure where he intended to end a sentence, or whether he recognized the sentence as a unit of expression. . . . Byron himself recognized his lack of knowledge of the logic or the rules of punctuation. . . . It is not without reason then that most editors, including R. E. Prothero, have imposed sentences and paragraphs on him in line with their interpretation of his intended meaning. It is my feeling, however, that this detracts from the impression of Byronic spontaneity and the onrush of ideas in his letters, without a compensating gain in clarity. In fact, it may often arbitrarily impose a meaning or an emphasis not intended by the writer. I feel that there is less danger of distortion if the reader may see exactly how he punctuated and then determine whether a phrase between commas or dashes belongs to one sentence or another. (p. 28) Marchand, like most of the other advocates of this point of view, adds that the unmodernized text is not difficult to read; but the reasons for not modernizing, it is clear, are of sufficient weight that the question of whether the resulting text is somewhat difficult to read is of secondary importance. 79 The statements quoted here, which make a number of different points and refer to a variety of periods and kinds of material, add up to an impressive argument and are no doubt sufficient in themselves as a criticism of the partially modernized and silently emended editions described earlier. Merely to juxtapose comments on editorial policy from the two kinds of edition is to show up the weaknesses of attempting to justify modernization and silent alterations in scholarly editions of historical documents. But it will perhaps be useful to try to sort out more clearly the issues involved, especially since there has been so little discussion of the matter, at least in connection with the editions of statesmen's papers. Although a voluminous literature has grown up around the NHPRC editions, it contains very little commentary on textual procedures, and what there is seldom touches on fundamental questions. The NHPRC editions have probably been more extensively reviewed than the CEAA editions; but in both fields it is difficult to find reviewers who can adequately analyze textual policies, and the reviews of NHPRC volumes in particular have almost consistently slighted—or ignored completely, except for a perfunctory word of praise—the textual aspects of the editions. 80 The historical significance of the contents of these editions and the quality of the explanatory annotation—on which the reviews concentrate—are important matters, but the way in which the text has been established and presented is surely of first importance in evaluating an edition. Considerable criticism has been directed at the NHPRC editions but for essentially irrelevant or trivial reasons. One objection, raised by Leonard W. Levy, for example, in his reviews of the Madison edition, is that the explanatory annotation is carried to excessive lengths. 81 Another criticism questions the choice of material to be edited. J. H. Plumb, among others, believes that too much attention is paid to unimportant documents, 82 and Jesse Lemisch argues that the pattern of figures chosen to be edited reflects a bias "in the direction of white male political leaders." 83 Whatever justice there may be to these opinions, they have nothing to do with the quality of the editions themselves. If the annotation is accurate and helpful, it will be of use, and there is little point in wishing there were less of it; and any document or figure is of some historical interest. Individual tastes regarding what material is worth spending time on, and judgments about priorities, will naturally vary; one may deplore another's choice of subject, but it is unrealistic to criticize accomplished work for having usurped time better spent on something else. Still another frequent complaint is that letterpress editions are too expensive and time-consuming to produce and that microfilm publication of the documents would be cheaper, faster, and more appropriate. 84 Certainly the well-established microfilm publication programs of the NHPRC, the National Archives, the Library of Congress, and various state historical societies are to be praised; 85 but making photographic reproductions of document collections widely available is by no means a substitute for editing those documents, 86 as Julian Boyd and Lester Cappon, among others, have effectively pointed out. 87 The skilled editor, employing his critical intelligence and fund of historical detail, establishes a text which marks an advance in knowledge over the mere existence of the document itself. Microfilm editions of unedited documents do not obviate true editions; but editing takes time, and one is back at the earlier question of individual priorities for spending time. These controversies are really peripheral to the main business of editing. Since individual priorities do differ, anyone may decide not to become an editor; but for those who elect to undertake editorial projects, surely the first priority is the text itself, its treatment and presentation. And when one considers the divergences of textual policy which distinguish most NHPRC editions from the CEAA and CSE editions, the first question to ask is whether there is an essential difference between the materials of historical interest and those of literary interest that would necessitate differing treatments. Nathan Reingold, in a letter to the American Scholar (45 [1976], 319) commenting on Peter Shaw's article, suggests such an explanation, pointing out that the CEAA editors work with printed texts, whereas the historical editors for the most part deal with thousands of "scrappy and informal" bits of manuscript. It is true that the bulk of the CEAA and CSE editions are of works which have previously appeared in print, 88 but those editions do include numerous volumes of manuscript letters and journals, and of course in the literary field in general many editions of such material exist. It may also be true that letters predominate in editions of statesmen's papers, but the comprehensive editions do include speeches, reports, and other works of a public nature normally intended for distribution in printed form. Is a letter written by a literary figure in some way fundamentally different from a letter written by a statesman? Both are historical documents: literary history is still history, and all letters offer historical evidence. And either letter may be regarded as "literature": a statesman may produce masterly letters, and a literary figure may write pedestrian ones. Is a novel or a poem fundamentally different from a work which a statesman prepares for publication? At their extremes, imaginative literature and factual reporting seem to be different kinds of communication, but in between there is a large area in which they overlap. No clear line can be drawn between writing which is "literature" and writing which is not. Certainly the editor of an individual's whole corpus of papers is likely to encounter writings which can be regarded either way: some of Franklin's and Jefferson's best-known writings have often been classified and analyzed as literary works, whereas Hawthorne's Life of Franklin Pierce and Whitman's journalism are not always considered literature. There sometimes seems to be an assumption that close attention to textual nuances—and thus the need for recording textual details—is more vital to the study of literary works and other writings by literary figures. 89 Apparently that is part of Frederick B. Tolles's point when he criticizes the "zeal" of the editor of George Mercer's papers for her "reverent handling" of the texts: "it seems important to remind ourselves," he says, "that they are not sacred codices of Holy Writ or variant quartos of Hamlet ." 90 He also means, of course, that Mercer's papers are not as important as Hamlet . But neither the importance nor the literary quality of a piece of writing determines the amount of attention that must be paid to nuances of expression; if one seriously wishes to understand a text, whatever it is, no aspect of it can be slighted. 91 There is no fundamental distinction, then, from a textual point of view, between the materials edited by the historian and those edited by the literary scholar. Letters, journals, published works, and manuscripts of unpublished works fall into both fields; all of them are historical documents, and any of them can be "literary." 92 A distinction does need to be made, but not between literary and historical materials. Rather, the important distinction is between two kinds of writings which both historians and literary scholars have to deal with: works intended for publication and private papers. 93 Works intended for publication are generally expected to conform to certain conventions not applicable to private documents. For example, a finished work is expected to incorporate the author's latest decisions about what word he wishes to stand at each spot; in a private notebook jotting, however, or even in a letter to a friend, he can suggest alternative words and is under no obligation to come to a decision among them. 94 Similarly, he can spell and punctuate as he pleases in a private document, but he will have difficulty getting a work published if it does not conform, at least to some extent, to current standards. Whether or not a writer really wishes to have his manuscript altered by a publisher's editor or a printer to bring it into such conformity is a complex question of intention, and editorial debate on this issue is likely to continue. Some editors feel that a surviving completed manuscript of a published work is the proper choice for copy-text because it reflects the author's characteristics more accurately, while others feel that the published text should be the copy-text because the author expected his manuscript to be subjected to the normal routines of publishing. No doubt the answer will vary in different situations, but this is not the place to explore the question. 95 The point here is to contrast that situation with the very different one which exists for private documents. In the case of notebooks, diaries, letters, and the like, whatever state they are in constitutes their finished form, and the question of whether the writer "intended" something else is irrelevant. One still sometimes hears the argument that an editor must make alterations in such documents because the writer would have expected to make changes in them for publication. If the writer had in fact prepared them for publication, they would then no longer be private documents but works intended for the public; they would have passed through the usual steps leading to publication, as any other work would, and the author probably would have made alterations in them, since the original documents would be parallel with the rough or semifinal drafts of other kinds of works. But when the writer did not prepare his own letters or diaries for publication, they remain private papers. The scholarly editor who later wishes to make them public is not in the same position as the writer or the writer's contemporary publisher. Not only is it impossible for him to know what the writer or his publisher would have done to them; but if he presents them as anything more polished or finished than they were left by the writer, he is falsifying their nature. A journal, as a piece of writing for one's own use, is in its final form whenever one stops adding to it; a letter, as a communication to a private audience of one or two, is in its final form whenever it is posted. The writer is under no constraint to conform to any particular convention in these writings, except to the extent that he hopes a letter will be comprehensible to its recipient. Any idiosyncrasies in them—however contrary to the standards for published works—are an essential part of their character. These considerations lead to the conclusion that a scholarly edition of letters or journals should not contain a text which has editorially been corrected, made consistent, or otherwise smoothed out. Errors and inconsistencies are part of the total texture of the document and are part of the evidence which the document preserves relating to the writer's habits, temperament, and mood. Modernization, too, is obviously out of place. While it is not the same thing as the correction of errors or inconsistencies, the line between the two is often difficult to establish. Even in many published works the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are inconsistent, and to assume that the writers or publishers intended them to be consistent or cared whether they were consistent or not is to read into the situation a point of view held by many people today but one that has apparently not always been held. Correcting errors is somewhat different, since by definition an error is not intended; but it is frequently difficult to avoid a modern bias in deciding what constitutes an error. Editors of published works are increasingly recognizing that to regularize or to make certain supposed corrections is to modernize. 96 In the case of private documents, then, where errors and inconsistencies are an integral part of the text, the argument against modernization is doubly strong. Indeed, the position that the text of a scholarly edition of any material can ever be modernized is indefensible. Many editors of literary works have long understood this fact, 97 and it is difficult to explain why such a large number of editors of private documents have, during the same period, neglected it. They are not always cognizant of a distinction between correcting and modernizing; but to subject such documents to either is to violate their integrity. Ultimately the position of these editors rests on a failure to grasp the significance of punctuation, capitalization, and spelling as functional elements of written expression. They think, as a result, that they can make alterations "for clarity" and "for the reader's convenience" without affecting the content of the document in any important way. In most instances, they greatly exaggerate the difficulty of reading the original text, and it is hard to see how the reader's "convenience" is really served by changing a dash to a period, an ampersand to "and," or an upper-case letter to lower case. 98 What, in the end, do they accomplish, other than depriving the reader of the experience of reading the original text? Is the text "clearer" as a result of their labors? Frequently it is less clear, because documentary editors rarely modernize more than a few features, leaving the text with a confused and unhistorical mixture of elements that clash with each other. 99 What is intended as a help becomes a barrier between the reader and the text he is interested in reading. Anyone who has examined a number of the partially modernized editions of letters can only react with incredulity at the things which editors seem to think readers need to have done for them. The modernizing editor is both condescending and officious: he assumes that the reader is not serious enough to persevere in reading a work if the punctuation, capitalization, and spelling do not conform to present-day practice, and his belief in the necessity of making changes blinds him to the triviality and senselessness of many of his alterations. 100 Modernization, or partial modernization, is clearly incompatible with the goals of the scholarly editing of private documents—a fact which points to the most tragic weakness of many of the NHPRC editions. Once it is settled that letters and journals are not to be presented in a corrected or modernized text, there still remains the question of whether editorial symbols are to be employed within the text or whether the text is to be free of such symbols ("clear text"). Even though no corrections are made, 101 there will be occasions when the editor needs to introduce a comment, such as "word illegible," "edge of paper torn, eliminating several words," or "written in the margin." Whether these explanations are entered in brackets in the text or printed as appended notes is to some extent merely a mechanical matter. But there is a theoretical aspect to the question. It is often argued that novels, essays, poems, and other works intended for publication should be edited in clear text, because such works are finished products, and the intrusion of editorial apparatus into the text (recording emendations or variants, for example) would be alien to the spirit of the work. For this reason the CEAA editions of this kind of material are in clear text, with the textual data relegated to lists at the ends of the volumes. 102 Private documents are different, however, in that they are often characterized by not being smooth—by containing, that is, false starts, deletions, insertions, and so on. The problem of how to handle deletions gets to the heart of the matter. Simply to leave them out, as is often done (or done on a selective basis), is indefensible, since they are essential characteristics of private documents. 103 One solution would be to leave them out of the text and report them in notes. But to do so would make the text appear smoother than it is; no evidence would be lost, but the reader would have to reconstruct the text of the document, which is after all of primary interest. If, on the other hand, the deletion is kept in the text but clearly marked as a deletion (with angle brackets or some other device), the nature of the original is more accurately rendered in print. In reading the original, one would see a phrase with a line through it, for instance, and then read the phrase which replaced it; by keeping the deleted matter in the text, the editor allows the reader to have the same experience. But when canceled matter is recorded, it is essential at the same time to indicate whether the replacement (if any) occurs on the same line or is inserted above the line, so that the reader can tell whether the revision was made in the process of writing the words or perhaps at a later time. 104 A number of the NHPRC editions devote some attention to cancellations, but their frequent failure to specify interlinear insertions makes it impossible for the reader to use properly the texts of the cancellations which they do provide. Some situations can become very complex and may require an editorial description of what has happened as well as editorial symbols. This description might well be placed in a note rather than in the text; but since the text will contain editorial symbols in any case, one could decide to include editorial comments—at least the brief ones, like "illegible"—within the text. 105 The crucial point is that if a private document is presented in clear text it loses part of its texture. 106 The argument thus far has assumed that for any given text the evidence available to the editor is a single document in the hand of the author. In those cases the editor's goal is to reproduce in print as many of the characteristics of the document as he can. The goal is not, in other words, to produce a critical text, except to the extent that judgment is involved in determining precisely what is in the manuscript. And judgment is inevitably involved: the editor of Shelley and His Circle points out that if a word clearly intended to be "even" looks more like "ever" it is still transcribed as "even." Distinguishing between an actual misspelling or slip of the pen and merely indistinct or hasty handwriting requires careful judgment. The editor, even in presenting an "exact" transcription of the text of a document, must keep the writer's habits and intention in mind, if he is to be successful in discovering what that text actually says at difficult spots. If, for instance, a manuscript clearly reads "seperate," there is no doubt that the author wrote the word with a middle "e"; whether or not the author intended to misspell is irrelevant, so long as one agrees that an author's errors in private documents are of interest and should be preserved. But if the word only looks like "seperate" because the author has been careless in forming an "a" in the second syllable, the editor who prints "seperate" is neither transcribing accurately nor respecting the author's intention. In a case like "even"/"ever," the intention as determined by the context plays a greater role: deciphering handwriting and understanding the content are inseparable. 107 It is frequently necessary, therefore, even in connection with a so-called "literal" transcription, for an editor to append notes recording editorial decisions, if the reader is to be fully apprised of the state of the manuscript. But these decisions, it should be clearly understood, result from the effort to determine what the text of the document actually says, not what the editor believes it ought to say. The situation is different, however, when the textual evidence is not limited to a single holograph document; there may be several drafts, versions, or copies, and they may be in the hand of a copyist or in printed form. In such cases the editor has a fundamental decision to make about the nature of his edited text: is it still to be a transcription of the text of a single document (with evidence from related documents given in notes), or is it to be a critical text which attempts through emendation (based on a study of all the documents) to represent the writer's intentions more fully than any single surviving document can? This decision will rest on the nature of the surviving documents—on their relative authority and completeness. When there are various versions or drafts of a letter in the author's hand, the editor would normally choose the one actually posted, if it survives, or the retained copy or latest surviving draft if it does not, as the document to be edited; variant readings and canceled matter in the other documents might then be added in notes, but—in line with the reasoning suggested above—they would not be emended into the text itself. If, on the other hand, the extant version or versions of a text are not in the author's hand—as when a letter survives only in several scribal copies or in print—the editor is faced with the problem of distinguishing those features which reflect the author's intention from those which result from the habits and errors of another person (the copyist, the compositor, the printer's or publisher's reader, and so on). Since the interest is in the characteristics of the author's expression, not in those of a copyist or compositor, this problem is worth solving. For if an editor presents the text of a nonholograph document in an exact transcription, as he would that of a holograph document, he is respecting equally its authorial and its nonauthorial features; but if he attempts, so far as his evidence allows, to remove some of the nonauthorial features, he comes that much closer to offering what was present in the author's manuscript. Editors of works which were intended to be made public commonly have this problem to deal with. When confronted with a printed text or texts, or with a printed text which differs from the author's manuscript, or with a scribal copy or copies, these editors frequently take it as their responsibility to evaluate the evidence (on the basis of their specialized knowledge of the author, his time, and the textual history of the work) and then to choose and emend a copy-text so as to obtain a maximum number of authorial readings and characteristics and a minimum number of nonauthorial ones. 108 The CEAA editions of works intended for publication have taken this approach, on the ground that more is to be gained by encouraging a qualified editor to apply what judgment and sensitivity he has to the problem of determining the author's intended text than by requiring him to reproduce the text present in a particular surviving document. Some mistakes are bound to result, but in general a text produced in this way is likely to come closer to what the author intended than a single documentary text could possibly do. (An accompanying record of emendations and variant readings is naturally important, so that the reader can reconstruct the copy-text and reconsider the evidence for emending it.) Editors of letters and journals will perhaps less frequently encounter similar situations, but when they do they should remember that preparing a critical text of nonholograph materials is not inconsistent with a policy of presenting a literal text of holograph manuscripts. Rather, it is an intelligent way of recognizing that a consistency of purpose may require different approaches for handling different situations. The aim of an edition of a person's letters and journals is to make available an accurate text of what he wrote; that goal cannot be achieved as fully for nonholograph documents as for holograph ones, but it is the editor's responsibility to come as close as he can in either case. 109 When Peter Shaw claims that the NHPRC editions show more respect for historical fact than do the CEAA editions, he fails to recognize that an edition with a critical or "eclectic" text does not necessarily conceal historical facts and that an edition of a single documentary text does not necessarily reveal all relevant facts. Whether they do so or not depends on their policies for recording textual data. 110 CEAA editions are required to include textual apparatuses which contain records of all editorial emendations as well as several other categories of textual information; 111 most of the NHPRC editions, on the other hand, incorporate several kinds of silent emendations. 112 Readers of the former are able to reconstruct the original copy-texts and are in possession of much of the textual evidence which the editor had at his disposal; readers of the latter cannot reconstruct to the same degree the details of the original documents and are not provided with carefully defined categories of textual evidence on a systematic basis. The CEAA editors fulfill an essential editorial obligation: they inform their readers explicitly of what textual information can and what cannot be found in their pages. 113 The truth is, therefore, that the CEAA editions are actually more respectful of documentary fact, and at the same time they recognize more fully that fidelity to a writer's intention demands, under certain circumstances, an eclectic approach to the documents. Comparing a CEAA edition of a novel with an NHPRC edition of letters creates a false opposition; but when CEAA and NHPRC editions of similar materials—two volumes of letters 114 or two volumes of works intended for publication—are compared, the CEAA volumes characteristically exhibit a more profound understanding of the problems involved in textual study and a greater responsibility in treating textual details. The NHPRC editors have undeniably been successful in the nontextual aspects of their work, and the CEAA editors could learn from them in regard to explanatory annotation. But in textual matters the CEAA editors are far in the lead. This state of affairs is a depressing reminder of how little communication sometimes exists between fields with overlapping interests. In 1949, the year before the first volume of the Jefferson edition appeared, Fredson Bowers commented on the importance of textual study for all fields of endeavor: No matter what the field of study, the basis lies in the analysis of the records in printed or in manuscript form, frequently the ill-ordered and incomplete records of the past. When factual or critical investigation is made of these records, there must be—it seems to me—the same care, no matter what the field, in establishing the purity and accuracy of the materials under examination, which is perhaps just another way of saying that one must establish the text on which one's far-reaching analysis is to be based. 115 In the twentieth century scholars of English literature—especially of Elizabethan drama—have taken over from the Biblical scholars and classicists as leaders in the development of textual theory and practice; and in the last generation the editing of nineteenth-century American literature has been a focal point in this continuing tradition. But the principles that have been emerging are not limited in their applicability to the field of literature. Students in all fields have occasion to work with written or printed documents, and they all need to have the habit of mind which inquires into the "purity and accuracy" of any document they consult. The NHPRC volumes have been singled out here because they constitute a prominent block of modern editions and can serve as an instructive example: the difference between the way American statesmen and American literary figures have recently been edited is a striking illustration of how two closely related fields can approach the basic scholarly task of establishing dependable texts in two very different ways, one of which seems superficial and naïve in comparison to the other. But history and literature are not the only fields that would mutually profit from a more encompassing discussion of textual problems; many editorial projects are now under way in philosophy and the sciences, and the fundamental questions which editors must ask are the same in those fields also. Editing is of course more than a matter of technique; a text can be satisfactorily edited only by a person with a thorough understanding of the content and historical and biographical setting of that text. Nevertheless, there is a common ground for discussion among editors in all fields. The time for closer communication of this kind is overdue; not only editors but all who study the written heritage of the past will benefit from it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In what follows I shall use "NHPRC" when referring in general to the editions produced with the assistance of the Commission from 1950 on; but for historical accuracy "NHPC" will be used in those instances where the reference is clearly to events preceding late 1974. 2 A comprehensive list of "Documentary Works Planned, in Progress, and Completed in Association with the National Historical Publications Commission" appears in Oliver W. Holmes, Shall Stagecoaches Carry the Mail? (1972), pp. 93-105; many of the editions are also listed in the Brubaker and Monroe articles mentioned in note 10 below. Earlier lists form the appendix to " Let every sluice of knowledge be open'd and set a flowing": A Tribute to Philip May Hamer . . . (1960) and Appendix B to the NHPC's 1963 Report (see note 8 below). Most of the CEAA editions are mentioned in the CEAA's Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (rev. ed., 1972), pp. 22-23, and in Studies in Bibliography , 25 (1972), 43-44; all of them are listed in The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement (1977), pp. 7-8. 3 Bernard Bailyn, for instance, states that the Jefferson edition "introduces a new era in the history of American documentary publications" ("Boyd's Jefferson: Notes for a Sketch," New England Quarterly , 33 [1960], 380-400 [p. 380]). He also refers to the "series of massive documentary publications launched since World War II" and calls it "a remarkable movement in modern American letters" ("Butterfield's Adams: Notes for a Sketch," William and Mary Quarterly , 3rd ser., 19 [1962], 238-256 [pp. 239-240]). Edmund S. Morgan proclaimed in a 1961 review of the Adams edition that "a new kind of scholarship has begun in the United States" ("John Adams and the Puritan Tradition," New England Quarterly , 34 [1961], 518-529 [p. 518]); and Esmond Wright, in another review of the Adams project, declared that this "age of the editor" is "transforming the methodology and character of American history" ("The Papers of Great Men," History Today , 12 [1962], 197, 213). 4 I shall not continue to place "literary" and "historical" in quotation marks but wish to make clear that these adjectives are used here only to refer to the fact that some persons are generally thought of as literary figures and some as historical figures; the adjectives are not meant to imply that there is any firm dividing line between material of literary interest and material of historical interest or that material cannot be of interest in both ways simultaneously. (In fact, all documents are of historical interest; and I trust that it will be clear when—as in the title—I use "historical" in this more basic sense. See also note 18 below.) 5 Interest in editing scientific manuscripts is increasing also, as evidenced by a Conference on Science Manuscripts in Washington on 5-6 May 1960; one of the papers presented was Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., "Editing a Scientist's Papers," Isis , 53 (1962), 14-19, which takes Benjamin Franklin as its principal example. 6 "Historical Grist for the Bibliographical Mill," Studies in Bibliography , 25 (1972), 29-40. Cf. the way P. M. Zall begins his article on "The Manuscript and Early Texts of Franklin's Autobiography," Huntington Library Quarterly , 39 (1976), 375-384: "How odd it is that even in this bicentennial year we should know more about the texts of Shakespeare's plays than we do about the text of Franklin's Autobiography —especially since Shakespeare's manuscripts are nowhere to be found, while the original manuscript of the Autobiography lies open to the public in the gallery of the Huntington Library." 7 "Morgan &amp; Brown," Book Collector , 25 (1976), 168. 8 The principal official statements of the position of the new NHPC are A National Program for the Publication of the Papers of American Leaders: A Preliminary Report . . . (1951); A National Program . . . A Report . . . (1954); and A Report to the President . . . (1963). See also Philip M. Hamer, The Program of the National Historical Publications Commission (1952). The 1954 report states that the NHPC's "primary responsibility, in addition to that of planning, is to cooperate with and assist other organizations or individuals in their work on parts of the national program" (p. 30); the brief section on "Editorial Policies" (pp. 32-33) stresses the importance of presenting uncensored texts of both sides of a correspondence. 9 The CEAA's position was officially set forth in 1967 in a Statement of Editorial Principles ; this booklet was revised in 1972 as Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures . 10 The history of the NHPRC—and of previous historical editing in America as background to it—has been expertly recounted in a number of essays (which also inevitably express opinions on what standards are desirable in editing). See, for example, Clarence E. Carter, "The United States and Documentary Historical Publication," Mississippi Valley Historical Review , 25 (1938-39), 3-24; L. H. Butterfield, "Archival and Editorial Enterprise in 1850 and in 1950: Some Comparisons and Contrasts," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 98 (1954), 159-170; Waldo G.

Dunlap and Fred Shelley (1976), pp. 89-96. The Brubaker and Monroe essays include detailed surveys of the critical reception of NHPRC editions. Historical accounts also appear in the NHPC's 1951, 1954, and 1963 reports (see note 8 above); more recent developments can be followed in the NHPRC's newsletter, Annotation (1973- ). Earlier discussions are J. Franklin Jameson, "Gaps in the Published Records of United States History," American Historical Review , 11 (1905-6), 817-831; and Worthington Chauncey Ford, "The Editorial Function in United States History," ibid. , 23 (1917-18), 273-286. Some analyses of earlier American editing are Fred Shelley, "Ebenezer Hazard: America's First Historical Editor," William and Mary Quarterly , 3rd ser., 12 (1955), 44-73; Lee Nathaniel Newcomer, "Manasseh Cutler's Writings: A Note on Editorial Practice," Mississippi Valley Historical Review , 47 (1960-61), 88-101; L.

Cappon, "American Historical Editors before Jared Sparks: ' they will plant a forest . . .,'" William and Mary Quarterly , 3rd ser., 30 (1973), 375-400. A few other general comments on the NHPRC or recent documentary editing are worth mentioning: Dumas Malone, "Tapping the Wisdom of the Founding Fathers," New York Times Magazine , 27 May 1956, pp. 25, 32, 34, 37, 39; Whitfield J.

Morris, "The Current Statesmen's Papers Publication Program: An Appraisal from the Point of View of the Legal Historian," American Journal of Legal History , 11 (1967), 95-106. 11 For the history and background of the CEAA, see William M. Gibson and Edwin H. Cady, "Editions of American Writers, 1963: A Preliminary Survey," PMLA , 78 (1963), 1-8 (September supp.); Willard Thorp, "Exodus: Four Decades of American Literary Scholarship," Modern Language Quarterly , 26 (1965), 40-61; Gibson, "The Center for Editions of American Authors," Scholarly Books in America , 10 (January 1969), 7-11; John H. Fisher, "The MLA Editions of Major American Authors," in the MLA's Professional Standards and American Editions: A Response to Edmund Wilson (1969), pp. 20-26 (cf. "A Calendar," pp. 27-28, and a reprinting of Gibson's 1969 article, pp. 1-6); and Don L. Cook, "Afterword: The CEAA Program," in American Literary Scholarship: An Annual , 1972, pp. 415-417. 12 The CEAA allocated NEH funds to the individual associated editions; the CSE draws NEH funds only for its own operation, and the award of NEH grants to particular editions is made directly by the NEH. 13 A history and analysis of the controversy over the CEAA editions is provided by G. T. Tanselle in "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," SB , 28 (1975), 167-229; some of the criticism of the NHPRC editions is found in the articles cited in notes 81, 82, 83, and 84 below, and some commentary on that criticism in the paragraph to which those notes are attached. 14 For example, Julian P. Boyd has said, "I deplore the fact that these [editorial] enterprises, despite the labors of J. Franklin Jameson and others, arose on the edge of the profession, beyond it, or even on occasion, in spite of some obstacles thrown up from within it"; see "Some Animadversions on Being Struck by Lightning," Daedalus , 86 (1955-57), 49-56 (p. 50). He also has stated, "That a mastery of the techniques and uses of scholarly editing is not now regarded as part of the indispensable equipment of the academic historian and as being a recognizable aspect of his duty is beyond question," and he points out that many people regard "the editorial presentation of documents as being almost mechanical in nature"; see "Historical Editing in the United States: The Next Stage?", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society , 72 (1962), 309-328 (pp. 314-315). Lester Cappon, in "A Rationale" (see note 10 above), also speaks of "the academic historian's prejudice against editing as a second-class pursuit"—a view in which the editor "appears to be a lone wolf, a kind of 'sport' detached from the mainstream of teaching, engaged in a task that is useful but nevertheless expendable" (pp. 58-59). Walter Rundell, in In Pursuit of American History (see note 10 above), summarizes, "Traditionally, academic historians have not held the function of documentary editing in especially high regard" (pp. 262-263). And Paul H. Bergeron—in "True Valor Seen: Historical Editing," American Archivist , 34 (1971), 259-264—says, "Only occasional efforts are made to breach the wall of prejudice that separates historians and editors" (p. 259). Cf. Stanley Idzerda, "The Editor's Training and Status in the Historical Profession," in the Dunlap and Shelley volume (see note 10 above), pp. 11-29. Such comments as these could be applied to the literary field as well; on the general lack of understanding of editing, see also note 80 below. Occasionally one hears the opposite point of view: Leo Marx, in "The American Scholar Today," Commentary , 32 (1961), 48-53, is bothered by "a suspicion that the scholar-editor is in fact the type we encourage and reward beyond all others" (p. 49); but his misunderstanding of editing is revealed by his labeling the editor a "humanist-as-technician" (p. 50). In the historical field, it may be noted, there has been a greater tradition of the full-time editor, independent of academic responsibilities, than in the literary field. 15 Editing has also perhaps been the subject of scholarly meetings more often in the historical field. Examples are the "Symposium on the Manuscript Sources of American History: Problems of Their Control, Use, and Publication" at the American Philosophical Society in November 1953 (see its Proceedings , 98 [1954], 159-188, 273-278); the session on "Publishing the Papers of Great Men" at the 1954 meeting of the American Historical Association (see Daedalus , 86 [1955-57], 47-79); the discussion of "Historical Editing in the United States" at the 150th annual meeting of the American Antiquarian Society in October 1962 (see its Proceedings , 72 [1962], 283-328); the session on the "Publication of Historical Source Materials" at the AHA meeting in December 1964; the series of "Special Evening Gatherings on the Writing, Editing, and Publishing of American History" at the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1964-65; and the session on "Historical Editing" at the 1974 AHA meeting. 16 The literature of the NHPC has been recorded by Oliver W. Holmes in "Recent Writings Relevant to Documentary Publication Programs," American Archivist , 26 (1963), 137-142—supplemented by an October 1971 typewritten list prepared by NHPC. Relevant materials can also be located in the checklists of archival scholarship which have appeared annually in the American Archivist since 1943. The literature of the CEAA (and related editions) is surveyed in an essay, "Relevant Textual Scholarship," appended to the CEAA's Statement (see note 2 above), pp. 17-25, and in The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement (1977), pp. 5-19. A few checklists of material also appeared in the CEAA Newsletter (1968-75). 17 "The American Heritage and Its Guardians," American Scholar , 45 (1975-76), 733-751 [i.e., 37-55]. 18 Although all written and printed artifacts are documents of historical interest (as pointed out in part III below), I am using "documentary" and "document" to refer particularly to private papers, such as letters, diaries, notebooks, rough drafts, and the like. 19 The method was also summarized by Lyman H. Butterfield in "The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Progress and Procedures in the Enterprise at Princeton," American Archivist , 12 (1949), 131-145. The early planning of the edition is reflected in Boyd's Report to the Thomas Jefferson Bicentennial Commission on the Need, Scope, Proposed Method of Preparation, Probable Cost, and Possible Means of Publishing a Comprehensive Edition of the Writings of Thomas Jefferson (1943). 20 Except that the "place and date-line, the salutation, and the complimentary close in letters will also be retained in literal form," though "the date-line is uniformly placed at the head of a letter" (p. xxx). It is somewhat surprising that these features of letters are singled out to be rendered with greater fidelity than the bodies of the letters. 21 More liberties are taken with "documents not in Jefferson's handwriting" if the punctuation makes a passage "misleading or obscure"; but if more than one meaning is possible, the punctuation is not altered and the problem is discussed in a note (p. xxx). The trouble with such an approach is that if only one meaning is possible the reader does not really need the editor's intervention in the punctuation in order to find it. 22 When such passages are not conjecturable, they are indicated by spaced periods within brackets if "one or two words or parts thereof" are missing; if a larger amount is missing, "a note to this effect will be subjoined." 23 There may of course be some versions with no claim to authority. But a distinction should be made between those copies which it is essential to collate—even for an "ordinary" document—and those which can safely be dismissed. (In a later article ["Some Animadversions"—see note 14 above], Boyd says, "We insist upon collating every text available" [p. 52].) 24 Of course, judgment is involved, even in a literal presentation, in deciding what is in fact present in the original text; but that is a different application of judgment from the one which results in altering what is in the text. (This distinction is commented on further in part III below.) 25 The identical situation occurs again at 338.25. 26 Some further remarks on Boyd's method in such texts are made by St. George L. Sioussat in American Historical Review , 56 (1950-51), 118-122—in one of the few reviews of an NHPRC edition to pay close attention to textual matters. 27 Carter had earlier made the same points in his article, "The Territorial Papers of the United States," American Archivist , 8 (1945), 122-135. 28 A few years later, Carter made the case even more forcefully, in "The Territorial Papers of the United States: A Review and a Commentary," Mississippi Valley Historical Review , 42 (1955-56), 510-524. Every aspect of a document, he says there, is "part and parcel of the intellectual climate of an era. Editorial tampering with punctuation, spelling, paragraphing, and the like, which means the introduction of textual corruptions, is anathema" (p. 516). 29 The only departure he condones is in regard to spacing: "unusual spacing should not be reproduced" (p. 27), he says, and all paragraphs should begin with indentions and (surprisingly) all salutations run in with the first lines of texts. It would be more in keeping with Carter's respect for documentary evidence not even to allow these alterations. Spacing can of course be regarded as a nontextual matter; but Carter's desire to "avoid undue expanses of blank paper" seems a trivial justification for changing the way a writer sets off a salutation or complimentary close. 30 Citations below are to subsection and paragraph numbers of the 1954 edition; the identical passages can easily be located in the 1974 edition, where the paragraph numbers remain the same (the subsections are not numbered but readily identified). The only significant revision in 1974 is the alteration of the opening paragraph to include references to five more recent discussions of editing, including Carter's. 31 Besides, the arbitrary limit of four letters is illogical, since there could well be instances of more missing letters in which the intended word was equally obvious. 32 The final sentence of this rule makes the odd suggestion that a clerk's marginal glosses in "court and similar records" may "either be omitted, or used as subheadings to save expense." If they are so unimportant that they can be omitted entirely, it seems strange that an alternative is to give them a prominent place in the text itself—so prominent as to impose upon the text the sense of its structure envisioned by the clerk. 33 Incidentally, the rule on such designations (III.3) states, "Points after monetary abbreviations are superfluous." But a previous rule (III.2b) tells what to do if an abbreviation is "still obscure after superior letters are brought down and a point added," as if the addition of the point is a factor in producing clarity. Whether abbreviations are written with or without periods is a matter of convention; determining whether or not a period is "superfluous" does not normally involve considerations of meaning. 34 Another statement which offers valuable advice occurs in the preliminary subsection: "In reprinting a document it is better to prepare a fresh text from the manuscript or photostat; for if an earlier printed edition is used as the basis, one is apt to repeat some of the former editor's errors, or maybe add others of one's own" (I.9). The last seven words should of course be eliminated: an editor can naturally make mistakes of his own, but this danger is present whether he is working from the original or a printed edition. 35 A superficial reason is also given for not being literal in quotations cited in secondary works: in these cases "the Expanded Method is far preferable to the literal, since the latter clashes unnecessarily with a modern text and makes readers pause to puzzle over odd spellings and abbreviations." (The Expanded Method here sounds very similar to the Modernized.) For some reason bracketed explanations are disapproved of in such quotations, though appended footnotes are not. 36 Just before the end it is stated that every text "should be compared word for word with the original, or with a microfilm or photographic copy," as if comparison against a photocopy could be substituted for comparison against the original. Many later historical editors do in fact comment on having taken their texts from photostats, microfilms, and the like, seemingly unaware of the dangers involved; literary editors more frequently remark on the necessity for the collation of transcriptions against the original manuscripts. For an excellent statement explaining why photographic reproduction can be "the most dangerous thing of all" for persons who have "a touching faith in the notion that 'the camera does not lie,'" see pp. 70-72 of Arthur Brown's article cited in note 97 below. 37 "Report on Editing Historical Documents," Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research [University of London], 1 (1923-24), 6-25; 3 (1925-26), 13-26. 38 "It is customary to adopt modern methods of punctuation, and cases are few in which departure from this procedure is advisable. The editor should, however, be careful not to alter the sense of a passage in altering the punctuation" (3, 22). 39 Two still earlier statements have much in common with the later ones. Charles Francis Adams, Jr., in "The Printing of Old Manuscripts," Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society , 20 (1882-83), 175-182, complains about the practice of reproducing manuscript abbreviations in print and believes that fidelity to a manuscript text "can be carried to fanaticism" (p. 182), though he does recognize that at least "the scholarly few" may wish to preserve the "complexion, as it were, of the period to which the book belongs." In "Suggestions for the Printing of Documents Relating to American History," Annual Report of the American Historical Association , 1905, 1:45-48, the position is taken that a manuscript should be printed "in the form which it would have borne if the author had contemporaneously put it into print" (p. 47), with obvious mistakes corrected, abbreviations expanded, and some punctuation clarified—though with certain cancellations recorded, as offering "some indication of the mental process of the writer." A more recent discussion by Edith G. Firth, "The Editing and Publishing of Documents," Canadian Archivist News-letter , No. 1 (1963), 3-12, makes clearer the reasons for not modernizing and recognizes that much modernization in any case results from "underestimating Everyman's ability" (p. 4). A similar point of view was cogently set forth thirty years earlier by Hilary Jenkinson, in "The Representation of Manuscripts in Print," London Mercury , 30 (1934), 429-438 (which also comments on the relation between historical and literary editing). 40 My brief comments on the editorial policies of these editions are not meant to be comprehensive; many other features, both praiseworthy and regrettable, could be discussed in addition to those I select as relevant illustrations here. Most of the editions, for instance, place in brackets editorial conjectures for illegible or missing words or letters, and most report variants or canceled readings on a selective basis, but these practices are generally not referred to. Citation of page numbers in each case, unless otherwise specified, refers to the first volume of an edition. 41 On the history and editing of Franklin's papers, see Francis S. Philbrick, "Notes on Early Editions and Editors of Franklin," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 97 (1953), 525-564; William E. Lingelbach, "Benjamin Franklin's Papers and the American Philosophical Society," ibid. , 99 (1955), 359-380; Leonard W. Labaree and Whit-field J. Bell, Jr., "The Papers of Benjamin Franklin: A Progress Report," ibid. , 101 (1957), 532-534; Labaree, "The Papers of Benjamin Franklin," Daedalus , 86 (1955-57), 57-62, and "The Benjamin Franklin Papers," Williams Alumni Review , 59 (February 1967), 11. P. M. Zall's article (see note 6 above) illustrates the kind of work which remains to be done on the textual history of Franklin's Autobiography , even after the appearance of the Yale edition. 42 Cf. his generalization, in "Scholarly Editing in Our Times," Ventures , 3 (Winter 1964), 28-31, that recent editors "may make concessions . . . to modern usage in such matters as spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, but they reproduce to the utmost of their ability the phraseology of the original" (p. 29). 43 Labaree follows Boyd's system of printing significant canceled passages in footnotes for ordinary documents and recording cancellations within the text for important documents. A few criticisms of the textual policy of the Franklin edition appear in J. A. Leo Lemay's review of the eighteenth volume in American Historical Review , 81 (1976), 1223-24. 44 See also his "Editing the Henry Clay Papers," American Archivist , 20 (1957), 231-238. 45 For general accounts of the papers, see L. H. Butterfield, "The Papers of the Adams Family: Some Account of Their History," Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society , 71 (1953-57), 328-356 (abridged as "Whatever You Write Preserve" in American Heritage , 10 [April 1959], 26-33, 88-93); Butterfield, "The Adams Papers," Daedalus , 86 (1955-57), 62-71; and Wendell D. Garrett, "The Papers of the Adams Family: 'A Natural Resource of History,'" Historical New Hampshire , 21, no. 3 (Autumn 1966), 28-37. All three include some historical comments on the editing of the papers. See also Butterfield in Holland: A Record of L. H. Butterfield's Pursuit of the Adamses Abroad in 1959 (1961), with comments by Julian P. Boyd and Walter Muir Whitehill; and The Adams Papers: Remarks by Julian P. Boyd, Thomas B. Adams, L. H. Butterfield, the President of the United States (1962). 46 There is thus the same difficulty here with interpreting canceled matter placed in angle brackets, when there is no symbol for interlineations: one cannot always tell whether the cancellation was made at the time of inscription or possibly later. 47 This edition (1954-59), in some 600 reels, has been influential in the movement to make manuscript collections available in microfilm form. For historical and evaluative comments on it, see L. H. Butterfield, "'Vita sine literis, mors est': The Microfilm Edition of the Adams Papers," Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress , 18 (1960-61), 53-58; Merrill Jensen, Samuel Flagg Bemis, and David Donald, "'The Life and Soul of History,'" New England Quarterly , 34 (1961), 96-105; and Wendell D. Garrett, "Opportunities for Study: The Microfilm Edition of The Adams Papers," Dartmouth College Library Bulletin , n.s., 5 (1962), 26-33. 48 And, on the nontextual side, to provide historical annotation. 49 Whether critical texts are more appropriate for some kinds of material than others is a separate question, as is the desirability of a record of all emendations in critical texts. 50 In an earlier article on "The Papers of Alexander Hamilton," in the Historian , 19 (1956-57), 168-181, Syrett and Jacob E. Cooke say that the Hamilton editors "expect to rely heavily on the precedent set by the Jefferson papers." See also Syrett, "Alexander Hamilton Collected," Columbia University Forum , 5, no. 2 (Spring 1962), 24-28. 51 For a history of the early work on this edition, see William H. Runge, "The Madison Papers," American Archivist , 20 (1957), 313-317. 52 One troublesome aspect of the punctuation in the Frémont is the treatment of the accent in Frémont's name. The editors have decided that the name can appear both with and without the accent; but they will not then allow it to appear both ways within a single document. 53 Jackson has described the process of getting an edition underway (drawing on his experiences with his more recent edition of George Washington's papers) in "Starting in the Papers Game," Scholarly Publishing , 3 (1971-72), 28-38. (He also comments on "The Papers of George Washington" in Manuscripts , 22 [1970], 2-11.) 54 See also Rogers's "The Papers of Henry Laurens," University of South Carolina Magazine , 1 (1965), 5-8. 55 The next sentence reads, "In the few instances where excessive editorial license was practiced, that fact has been noted." Surely the editor does not find his own alterations excessive; what is presumably meant is that some alterations are too great to go unnoted. But the reader has no way of knowing where the line has been drawn between silent and reported emendations. 56 See also Burl Noggle, "A Note on Historical Editing: The Wilson Papers in Perspective," Louisiana History , 8 (1967), 281-297. 57 See also Graf, "Editing the Andrew Johnson Papers," Mississippi Quarterly , 15 (1962), 113-118. 58 For a survey of the history and reception of this edition, see Haskell Monroe, "The Grant Papers: A Review Article," Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society , 61 (1968), 463-472. In connection with the editorial archives amassed by the staff of the Grant edition, Simon has discussed the interesting question of the policy that should be established regarding access to such material, in "Editorial Projects as Derivative Archives," College and Research Libraries , 35 (1974), 291-294. 59 See also Pete Daniel and Stuart Kaufman, "The Booker T. Washington Papers and Historical Editing at Maryland," Maryland Historian , 1 (1970), 23-29; and Harlan and Raymond W. Smock, "The Booker T. Washington Papers," ibid. , 6 (1975), 55-59. 60 Johnson, incidentally, exactly reverses Boyd's practice regarding "&amp;" and "&amp;c.": the former he retains and the latter he changes to "etc."—"to conform to modern usage and typography." 61 See also his "The Papers of Daniel Webster," Source , 1 (1971), 6-8. 62 Cf. Robert E. Cushman, "A Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution and the First Ten Amendments," Quarterly Legal Historian , 1 (March 1962), 3-6. 63 Lewis has commented on "Editing Familiar Letters" in the Listener , 49 (1953), 597-598—reprinted in Daedalus , 86 (1955-57), 71-77—and on "Editing Private Correspondence" in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , 107 (1963), 289-293 (where he confuses the issue by asserting that any editor who favors literal transcriptions of eighteenth-century documents should also "wear a wig while at work and give up cigarettes for snuff"). 64 As in Butterfield's "Historical Editing . . . The Recent Past," in Rundell's "Documentary Editing" (see note 10 above), or in Labaree's "Scholarly Editing" (see note 42 above). See also Butterfield's comments in The Letters of Benjamin Rush (American Philosophical Society, 1951), p. lxxvii. 65 See also his "Twenty Thousand Voltaire Letters," in Editing Eighteenth-Century Texts , ed. D. I. B. Smith (1968), pp. 7-24. 66 Precisely the opposite policy (correcting any accents present according to modern practice, but not supplying accents when they are omitted) is applied to the French in the sixth volume (1967) of The Correspondence of Edmund Burke , ed. Thomas W. Copeland et al. (Cambridge University Press and University of Chicago Press, 1958- ). 67 Although, it is fair to add, none of the editions with a CEAA or CSE emblem can be classed in this category. 68 For references to two similar statements of his, see notes 27 and 28 above. His earlier edition of The Correspondence of General Thomas Gage (Yale University Press, 1931-33) is characteristically careful but does not contain an analogous announcement of textual policy. 69 Johnson's spelling is of particular interest, too: "I have respected Johnson's spelling. It was worth while to show that the great systematic lexicographer did not in his own practice achieve a consistent orthography, and was conspicuously careless about proper names" (p. x). See also Chapman's "Proposals for a New Edition of Johnson's Letters," Essays and Studies , 12 (1926), 47-62. 70 Cf. her "Editing the Coleridge Notebooks," in Editing Texts of the Romantic Period , ed. John D. Baird (1972), pp. 7-25. 71 It is surprising, however, given this policy, that she regularizes Coleridge's "careless apostrophes" (p. xxxii)—especially in view of the variable placement of apostrophes which occurs even in printed matter in the nineteenth century. 72 Examples of editions in these years which present manuscript texts almost, but not entirely, in "verbatim" or "literal" form are The Letters of William Gilmore Simms , ed. Mary C. Simms Oliphant, Alfred Taylor Odell, and T. C. Duncan Eaves (University of South Carolina Press, 1952-56); and Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , ed. Earl Leslie Griggs (Clarendon Press, 1956-71). Both these retain the original spelling and punctuation but silently eliminate such slips as repetitions. The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln , ed. Roy P. Basler et al. (Rutgers University Press, 1953), silently corrects typographical errors in printed texts but brackets all emendations in manuscripts; Basler feels, however, that Lincoln's "habitual dash at the end of a sentence or following an abbreviation" must be altered to a period. 73 Such as closing parentheses and quotation marks. Although Cooper's use of a dash for a period is respected, sentences are nevertheless made to begin with capital letters. 74 Pochmann, as general editor of the Irving edition, was instrumental in formulating the policy for editing the journals; the volume editor for the first volume (1969) is Nathalia Wright and for the third (1970) Walter A. Reichart. William H. Gilman has said that the Irving editors "have spelled out their answers to problems [of journal editing] in more detail than any other conscientious and sophisticated editors I know of" (see his important review, cited in note 105 below). 75 Cancellations are thus included in the text, but there is also a list of "Details of Inscription" at the end, making clear the stages of revision at each point. 76 Harold Williams's edition of The Correspondence of Jonathan Swift (Clarendon Press, 1963-65) also prints the texts with "exact care," preserving "variants in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation" (p. xviii), including the period-dash combination at the ends of sentences; and Elvan Kintner's edition of The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, 1845-1846 (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1969) similarly presents a literal text, indicating insertions with arrows and allowing sentences to end with dashes and without periods. Some generally successful editions of these years do, however, include a small amount of modernization or normalizing. A. Rupert Hall and Marie Boas Hall's edition of The Correspondence of Henry Oldenburg (University of Wisconsin Press, 1965- ) follows the spelling and punctuation of the original but expands some abbreviations. Chester L. Shaver's The Early Years (Clarendon Press, 1967) and Mary Moorman's The Middle Years (1969) in the revised edition of The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth preserve the spelling and punctuation of the originals, but they inexplicably expand ampersands. Sentences are allowed to end with a dash and no period, but the "frequent ampersands have been changed to 'and' for the convenience of the reader" (Moorman, p. ix); it is difficult to see how ampersands constitute a sufficient inconvenience to warrant alteration in any case, but particularly when other potentially more troublesome practices are not altered. M. R. D. Foot and H. C. G. Matthew's edition of The Gladstone Diaries (Clarendon Press, 1968- ) follows the original punctuation and spelling "as closely as can be" (p. xxxviii) but expands some abbreviations and alters dashes to periods or commas "as the sense requires." The policy of the second volume of the "Research Edition" of The Yale Edition of The Private Papers of James Boswell is to normalize capitals and periods for sentence openings and closings and to ignore insignificant deletions, but to report any alterations of punctuation to "relieve ambiguities" and any corrections of "patent inadvertencies" in spelling; see Marshall Waingrow's edition of The Correspondence and Other Papers of James Boswell Relating to the Making of the "Life of Johnson" (McGraw-Hill, 1969), pp. lxxix-lxxxiii. (Cf. Frederick A. Pottle, "The Yale Editions of the Private Papers of James Boswell," Ventures, 2 [Winter 1963], 11-15.) 77 See also Reiman's "Editing Shelley," in Editing Texts of the Romantic Period , ed. John D. Baird (1972), pp. 27-45. 78 See also her "Letters and Journals of Fanny Burney: Establishing the Text," in Editing Eighteenth-Century Texts , ed. D. I. B. Smith (1968), pp. 25-43. 79 Another example of the kind of significance which punctuation can have is offered by Desmond Pacey, in "On Editing the Letters of Frederick Philip Grove," in Editing Canadian Texts , ed. Francess G. Halpenny (1975), pp. 49-73; Grove placed slang words in quotation marks, and Pacey retains them "since they indicate something of his stiffness of character" (p. 72). (Pacey, however, favors silent emendation of spelling errors, expansion of abbreviations, and regular italicization of titles.) 80 Reiman (see note 77 above) comments on the "dearth of knowledge and standards of judgment of editing . . . among those who review such publications [editions] in learned journals" (p. 37). And L. H. Butterfield, in "Editing American Historical Documents" (see note 10 above), says, "It is in fact shocking to find how low the threshold of tolerance sometimes is for poorly edited materials among those who should know better" (p. 98). Examples of the praise bestowed on the editorial practices of some of the historical editions, without a serious analysis of those practices, are the following: the Jefferson edition is said to be provided "with every ingenuity of typographical suggestion of the state of the manuscripts" ( Times Literary Supplement , 6 April 1951, p. 206); the Jefferson practices are called "so satisfactory as to require only minor modifications to adapt them to each later project" ( American Archivist , 25 [1962], 449); the Clay edition reflects "the precision that has come to distinguish the science of historical editing at its mid-twentieth century peak of perfection" ( Journal of Southern History , 26 [1960], 238); "Boyd and his fellow editors have perfected techniques of research, skills of analysis, and modes of presentation" ( Louisiana History , 8 [1967], 282). 81 Mississippi Valley Historical Review , 49 (1962-63), 504-6; Journal of American History , 51 (1964-65), 299-301. The first refers to "the editorial imperialism and compulsiveness that characterize these volumes"; the second comments on "monumentally trifling footnotes" and "fantastically detailed annotations" and finds the editors "making the profession of editing look purely pedantic." 82 Writing on "Horace Walpole at Yale" in the New York Review of Books , 5, no. 4 (30 September 1965), 9-10, Plumb objects to publishing "every scrap of writing committed to paper by one man" (which demands "little more than industry and accuracy") and asserts that Wilmarth Lewis started "a new and dangerous form of historical activity" which has "spread among historical and literary scholars like measles among the Aztecs, and as disastrously." Similarly Esmond Wright, in "Making History," Listener , 68 (1962), 803-804, names five ways in which the editions threaten the historian; one of them is the scale of the editions, for all the facts "blur rather than reveal." 83 In "The American Revolution Bicentennial and the Papers of Great White Men: A Preliminary Critique of Current Documentary Publication Programs," AHA Newsletter , 9, no. 5 (November 1971), 7-21 (p. 9). "The present publications program," Lemisch believes, "should be seen in part as a vestige of the arrogant nationalism and elitism of the 'fifties" (p. 11), and he suggests other kinds of papers worthy of attention, such as the records of ordinary and "inarticulate" people which would provide materials for studying popular protest, racism, sexism, and so on. Some correspondence relating to his article appeared in the same journal in May 1972 (10, no. 3, 25-28). The article was later excerpted in the Maryland Historian , 6 (1975), 43-50, followed by a new article in which Lemisch states that little progress has been made since 1971 in editing the papers of undistinguished persons: "The Papers of a Few Great Black Men and a Few Great White Women," pp. 60-66. 84 For example, Gerald Gunther, reviewing the Adams papers in the Harvard Law Review , 75 (1961-62), 1669-80, argues that "the present emphasis on multi-volume publication projects" is the "slowest and costliest" way to make manuscripts accessible; he believes that the NHPC has inadequately identified "the purposes of publishing manuscript collections," confusing publication with printing, and that more use should be made of microfilm (esp. pp. 1670-76). Steven R. Boyd, in "Form of Publication: A Key to the Widespread Availability of Documents," AHA Newsletter , 10, no. 4 (September 1972), 24-26, also favors microfilm, asserting that the NHPC letterpress program "is failing to make documentary sources generally available" and that "no new letterpress projects should be begun at this time." General discussions of alternatives are Charles E. Lee, "Documentary Reproduction: Letterpress Publication—Why? What? How?", American Archivist , 28 (1965), 351-365; and Robert L. Zangrando, "Alternatives to Publication," Maryland Historian , 7 (1976), 71-76 (which suggests that historians in general should give more consideration to forms of publication other than letterpress). 85 Some accounts of these programs can be found in Fred Shelley, "The Presidential Papers Program of the Library of Congress," American Archivist , 25 (1962), 429-433; Wayne C. Grover, "Toward Equal Opportunities for Scholarship," Journal of American History , 52 (1965-66), 715-724; L. H. Butterfield, "The Scholar's One World," American Archivist , 29 (1966), 343-361; Frank B. Evans, "American Personal Papers," Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress , 24 (1967), 147-151; and Shelley, "The Choice of a Medium for Documentary Publication," American Archivist , 32 (1969), 363-368. 86 It should also be recognized that even photographic reproductions can distort the originals. Cf. note 36 above. 87 For example, see Boyd, "Some Animadversions" (see note 14 above), p. 51, and "'God's Altar . . .'" (see note 10 above), p. 21; Cappon, "The Historian as Editor," in In Support of Clio: Essays in Memory of Herbert A. Kellar , ed. William B. Hesseltine and Donald R. McNeil (1958), pp. 173-193, and "A Rationale" (see note 10 above), pp. 72-73. The debate over the role of the editor as an interpretive historian is further examined by Cappon in "Antecedents of the Rolls Series: Issues in Historical Editing," Journal of the Society of Archivists , 4 (1970-73), 358-369. 88 Even in these cases, however, a manuscript rather than a printed edition may be chosen as the proper copy-text. 89 Robert Halsband, editor of The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (Clarendon Press, 1965-67), remarks, "It seems paradoxical that political and social historians—who, one would think, are sticklers for exactness—should prefer normalized texts, whereas literary historians strive for exact transcription"; and he conjectures that to the former "the facts are paramount," whereas the latter are concerned also with "nuances of style" (pp. 30-31). See his discussion of "Editing the Letters of Letter-Writers," SB , 11 (1958), 25-37—a useful survey of the problems involved (although it favors partial normalization and selective recording of deletions). Another general survey is James Sutherland's "Dealing with Correspondences," Times Literary Supplement , 26 January 1973, pp. 79-80 (in a special issue on "Letters as Literature"). 90 In his review of Lois Mulkearn's edition of the George Mercer Papers Relating to the Ohio Company of Virginia (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1954), Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , 74 (1955), 113-114. Cf. Julian Boyd's reply in "Some Animadversions" (see note 14 above), p. 50. 91 Reuben Gold Thwaites, early in the century, recognized the literary interest in essentially nonliterary materials in his edition of the Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804-1806 (Dodd, Mead, 1904-5); he prints the texts of successive drafts because "in a publication of original records it appears advisable to exhibit the literary methods of the explorers" (p. lvii). 92 The 1951 and 1954 reports of the NHPC (see note 8 above) include the names of literary figures in the lists of papers which need to be edited; the 1963 report comments, "American literature also presents a picture of compelling need. With few exceptions, no scholarly and acceptable texts of the works of any national figure in the field of American letters are available" (p. 28), and adds that it is prepared to give to literary editions "such assistance and encouragement as may be within its power." 93 Reingold approaches this point in his letter to the American Scholar when he acknowledges that occasionally "historical editors may reprint publications or present the texts of unpublished writings intended for print." 94 One of the best assessments of the importance of this practice is made by Timothy L. S. Sprigge in his edition of The Correspondence of Jeremy Bentham (University of London Athlone Press, 1968- ): "Special mention must be made of Bentham's habit, even in his letters, of writing alternative words and phrases above the line without deleting the original. In draft letters his intention was presumably to make a final choice at a later stage. But when writing to intimates he often left these alternatives standing; and this is at times a literary device of a distinctive character, the effect of which is that the sense of the passage arises from an amalgam of the two (or more) readings" (p. xxi). (After this admirable statement, it comes as a surprise to learn that Sprigge does not always print these alternative readings; to do so, he says, "would seriously imperil the readability of the text." And the ones he includes are marked in such a way as to be indistinguishable from interlinear insertions that replaced canceled matter.) 95 I have commented on this matter in "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," SB , 29 (1976), 167-211 (esp. pp. 183-191); cf. SB , 28 (1975), 222-227. 96 A cogent statement of this position is Hershel Parker's "Regularizing Accidentals: The Latest Form of Infidelity," Proof , 3 (1973), 1-20, which also contains an excellent summary of the arguments against "full" or "partial" modernization. See also Joseph Moldenhauer's comments in his edition of Thoreau's The Maine Woods (Princeton University Press, 1972), pp. 399-400. 97 See, for example, W. W. Greg's strong statement of the position in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (2nd ed., 1951), pp. l-liii; and Fredson Bowers, "Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts," in Studies in Honor of T. W. Baldwin , ed. D. C. Allen (1958), pp. 9-15 (reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [1975], pp. 289-295 [esp. pp. 291-293]). A standard exposition of many of the arguments for and against modernization is found in two essays of 1960: John Russell Brown (favoring modernization), "The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions of the Plays of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries," SB , 13 (1960), 49-67; and Arthur Brown (opposing modernization), ". . . A Rejoinder," ibid. , 69-76. 98 As Samuel Schoenbaum says, "Surely the illusion of quaintness fades very quickly as the reader settles down to the material at hand" (p. 23); see "Editing English Dramatic Texts," in Editing Sixteenth Century Texts , ed. R. J. Schoeck (1966), pp. 12-24. A curious fact is that the feature of manuscript letters most frequently discussed and altered by editors is a dash (with or without other punctuation) at the end of a sentence (or even within sentences). Changing the dash to a period (or, within sentences, to some other appropriate mark) is usually regarded not as modernization but as the correction of an error; any practice that has been so widespread in private writing over so many years, however, is more sensibly regarded as a standard custom than as an error. (Of course, even if it were an idiosyncrasy—"error"—of a particular writer, that fact would not be a reason to alter it.) 99 The case against partial modernization of a published work has been most effectively stated by Fredson Bowers (who calls it "basically useless and always inconsistent") in his review of the second volume (1963) of The Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson , which modernizes capitalization (and the italicization of quotations) but not spelling and punctuation; see "The Text of Johnson," Modern Philology , 61 (1964), 298-309, reprinted in his collected Essays , pp. 375-391 (esp. pp. 378-381). Hershel Parker (see note 96 above), surveying a number of comments, says that partial modernization "has been all but hooted out of textual circles" (p. 1). 100 The point has been succinctly put by Hershel Parker (see note 96 above): "Normalizing to satisfy an editor's instinct for tidiness or to make smooth the way of a reader is ultimately demeaning for the editor and insulting to the reader" (p. 19). 101 Some responsible editions, as noted earlier, do incorporate certain minor categories of correction—not modernization—into the text and indicate exactly what has been done in notes. If these categories are carefully defined, their presence in the text may not seriously interfere with the aim of maintaining the texture of the original. It is dangerous to argue, however, that nothing is lost just because all the evidence is available in the notes; there is an important difference in emphasis between a reading which is chosen to stand in the text and one which is relegated to a note or a list. 102 There are practical advantages to this system, also, in the case of works likely to be reproduced photographically for widespread distribution by commercial publishers. For further discussion, see G. T. Tanselle, "Some Principles for Editorial Apparatus," SB , 25 (1972), 41-88 (esp. pp. 45-49). 103 One of the reasons for their importance is suggested by Boyd when he refers to "those revealing deletions and first thoughts that so often unmask the writer's true feelings or motives" ("Some Animadversions" [see note 14 above], p. 52). Even when they are not revealing in this way, they are still part of the characterizing roughness of the document and are indicative of the writer's process of composition. 104 Methods of transcribing manuscripts in clear text (with apparatus) or in descriptive form (with symbols in the text) are carefully described by Fredson Bowers in "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants," SB , 29 (1976), 212-264. 105 Of course, a text with several kinds of brackets in it (and other symbols such as arrows) will be more awkward to quote in secondary works, and this practical consideration may, in the case of a few important texts likely to be widely quoted, cause the editor to choose clear text and record all deletions in notes; it is questionable, however, whether what is gained from a practical point of view really justifies the loss incurred. Generally, in any case, there is no more reason to regularize or modernize a quoted excerpt than the complete text itself. The problem of the quoter as his own editor, along with many other considerations affecting the extent of editorial intrusion in private documents, is taken up by William H. Gilman in an excellent and thorough discussion (occasioned by the appearance of the first volume of the Irving Journals ), "How Should Journals Be Edited?", Early American Literature , 6 (1971), 73-83. 106 This point was not recognized by Lewis Mumford in his famous review of the Emerson Journals , "Emerson Behind Barbed Wire," New York Review of Books , 18 January 1968, pp. 3-5, which objects to the inclusion of cancellations and editorial symbols. (See also the related correspondence in the issues of 14 March, pp. 35-36, and 23 May, p. 43.) 107 Shaw (see note 17 above) objects to the "essentially subjective basis for editorial revisions" (p. 741) in the critical-text policies of the CEAA editions and regards the attempt to "recapture 'the author's intention'" as opening "the door to chaos" (p. 740). He fails to acknowledge the subjectivity and concern for "intention" which are a part of all editing, even the transcription of a single manuscript text. 108 This "eclectic" approach is thoroughly discussed in Fredson Bowers's "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof , 4 (1975), 31-76 (reprinted in his collected Essays , pp. 488-528). See also the various writings on Greg's rationale of copy-text; many are mentioned by G. T. Tanselle in SB , 28 (1975), 167-229. 109 A difficult category consists of semifinished manuscripts of the kinds of works normally intended for publication: the manuscripts of some of Emily Dickinson's poems and of Melville's Billy Budd are prominent examples. From one point of view they are private documents, and their nature can best be represented by a literal transcription showing cancellations and insertions in the text; from another point of view they are simply unfinished literary works and ought therefore to be printed in a critically established clear text, the form in which one normally expects to read poems and fiction. The solution which Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., reach in their edition of Billy Budd (University of Chicago Press, 1962) is to print a "genetic text" accompanied by a "reading text." For some comments on the general problem and on Dickinson's poems in particular, see Tanselle's "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention" (see note 95 above), esp. pp. 205-207. 110 Shaw says, "With an eclectic text, the problem of variants is solved at the expense of making them disappear from view" (p. 739)—as if there is something about an eclectic text which prohibits the recording of variant readings. 111 Including at least the substantive variants in post-copy-text editions and the treatment of ambiguous line-end hyphens, along with a textual essay and discussions of problematical readings. For further explanation of the CEAA requirements, see the CEAA Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (rev. ed., 1972). 112 Shaw's argument for the Freudian significance of errors (pp. 742-743) is actually a more telling criticism of most of the NHPRC editions than of the CEAA editions; when a CEAA editor does correct an error, he reports that fact in a list of emendations, whereas NHPRC editors often make corrections without notifying the reader where these corrections occur. Shaw objects to the CEAA editor who "rewrites usage, punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and hyphenation" (p. 741) and misleadingly implies that this practice is in contrast to that of NHPRC editors; actually, changes of this kind occur with greater frequency in the NHPRC editions—and are often not recorded in any way. At another point Shaw seems to take a different position on the question of errors: "It would be unfair to the author literally to transcribe his manuscript without correcting his obvious oversights" (p. 740). 113 One of the reasons the CEAA editions are not "definitive," Shaw says, is "the physical impossibility of comparing and recording all the variants as demanded by copy-text theory" (p. 748). Presumably any respectable theory would require an editor to compare texts and locate variants; the CEAA policy for recording variants, however, has nothing to do with theory—obviously a text edited according to Greg's theory of copy-text would remain so edited whether or not it were accompanied by any apparatus. It is true that CEAA editions do not always record all variants (neither do the NHPRC editions); but the important point is that CEAA editions clearly define what categories of variants are to be recorded and record all that fall within those categories, whereas NHPRC editions normally record variants selectively on the vague basis of "significance." Therefore, if the word "definitive" must be used, it would seem to fit CEAA apparatus but generally not NHPRC apparatus. The objection has been well put by Bowers, who says of the Johnson edition (see note 99 above) that the reader "has no way of knowing whether he is or is not accepting in ignorance any of the extensive editorial silent departures from the copy-text features" (p. 379). 114 Shaw is incorrect in saying that CEAA editions "include no plans to publish authors' letters" (p. 748). The opening of the same sentence is also incorrect: "Unlike the historical editions, most of them are selected, not complete, editions." It would be more accurate to say that most of the CEAA editions are planned to be complete, not selective, and that many of the NHPRC editions are in fact selective (leaving out the texts of certain less important documents and instead summarizing them or mentioning their existence in a calendar of manuscripts). 115 "Bibliography and the University," University of Pennsylvania Library Chronicle , 15 (1949), 37-51 (p. 37); reprinted in his collected Essays , pp. 3-14.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Wynkyn de Worde's "Sir Thopas" and Other Tales by Thomas J. Garbáty</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor, 1 has not been treated well by commentators. He has been termed a "mechanic" and "in no sense a scholar," knowing little about the literary value of books. He has been faulted for not having high ideals and for printing solely for profit. Evidently he was extremely careless in his work, reprinting typographical errors without change. Henry Plomer, the main authority, repeatedly accuses the printer of lack of taste, "He was utterly devoid of all artistic feeling. He had no literary tastes. . . . All that can be said of Wynkyn de Worde as a printer is that, when he liked, he could turn out good work." 2 No doubt much of this is true. But there has also been some confusion regarding the printed corpus of Wynkyn de Worde. Vagueness and incomplete data have led to imprecision and misleading statements in reference books 3 and, more important, in those scholarly works which the academic community has long accepted as the foundations on which its variegated structures could safely be built. No one is at fault in this. Although perspicacious, we have all been like the proverbial blind men who described individual parts of the elephant but thought that they were defining the whole. Our information has been incomplete. My purpose here is not to attempt this final definition. All I wish to do at present is to describe my own part of the elephant by which he appears smooth, to the point, and well formed. It has long been thought that Wynkyn de Worde, in printing the fourth edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1498), did almost no independent work, but followed Caxton's revised second edition (ca. 1484) exactly. In 1892 Thomas Lounsbury wrote: "The text that was found in the second [edition of Caxton] was the one followed in the editions brought out by the printers who came immediately after, Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson." 4 Lounsbury, in his appraisal, anticipated W. W. Greg's thorough study of 1924, in which this scholar compared the first 116 lines of the Knight's Tale with the six earliest editions. His conclusion is well known. "Indeed, I may say at once that it is clear that no print after the first was set up from manuscript; each successive printer, whatever alterations or corrections he may have introduced, set up his edition from one or other of its predecessors." 5 Regarding Wynkyn de Worde in particular, Greg felt that there was no reasonable doubt that he printed from Caxton's second edition, as did Richard Pynson in 1492. It may be that Henry Plomer relied on these two scholars when he wrote, "Further reprints of Caxton's publications, notably the Morte d'Arthur , the Golden Legend , and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales . . . are the outstanding features of De Worde's press in 1498 . . ." (p. 58). Of course De Worde himself authorized this idea by printing the Prohemium to Caxton's second edition in his own work, ending, "By Wylliam Caxton / His soule in heuen won." Greg, however, does admit that Wynkyn de Worde possibly may have had recourse to one, unknown, manuscript because of De Worde's order of tales (AB 1 DE 1 E 2 F 1 F 2 GCB 2 HI) which is the order of Harley 7334, minus the tale of Gamelyn. Any manuscript of the Ellesmere type might have suggested the necessary transposition of tales from Caxton's edition. Greg sums up: "Wynkyn de Worde printed his edition from Caxton's second, and it is probable that he too had recourse to some manuscript source, though this cannot be identified." Caxton's first edition alone, "ranks with the manuscripts as a textual authority" (pp. 760, 761). I might add that Eleanor Hammond also noted Wynkyn's affinity in order of tales to Ha 4 . 6 Two of my fellow editors on the Variorum Chaucer , Professor Roy Pearcy (University of Oklahoma, Reeve's Tale ) and Professor Thomas Ross (Colorado College, Miller's Tale ) have arrived at similar conclusions in collating their tales. Both feel that De Worde was completely dependent on Caxton. 7 In collating Chaucer's tale of Sir Thopas for the Variorum , I have come to a different conclusion. True, I have examined only one part of the elephant, but this appears like pure ivory and superior to similar sections of any other edition until the one by Thomas Tyrwhitt (1775-8). Indeed, in some aspects the Wynkyn de Worde edition of Sir Thopas surpasses even the work of this great eighteenth-century editor. Admittedly Sir Thopas has many unique features. It is a short piece, extending to only 276 lines (including the Prioress-Thopas and Thopas-Melibeus link). It is written in 6 line tail rhyme stanza (aabaab), and in several manuscripts, El, Hg, Ad 3 , Dd, Gg among the superior manuscripts printed by the Chaucer Society and/or used for the Variorum , the scribe places the tail "b" lines to the right of lines a,a, slightly raised from the second "a" line and bracketed together, according to the following scheme: Virgules are used as punctuation in occasional manuscripts. Such a page would have posed an intricate spacing problem and evidence of great care in composition for the scribe. In addition to the peculiarities of page design, Sir Thopas has unusual textual problems which can be important shibboleths in bibliographical study. There are four short "tag lines" (1993, 2003, 2013, 2077). 8 Also, Sir Thopas , when interrupted by the Host, ends on a phrase (210) which is different or out in many manuscripts. The interruption and addresses to Chaucer by the Host are differently signalled or left out in the texts. Finally, several manuscripts have a gloss at line 1884. From the evidence of these signals in particular and the whole text in general, I suggest that Wynkyn de Worde in the links and tale of Sir Thopas , as well as in a few other pieces to be mentioned below, ranks as a textual authority independent of Caxton. In fact, it seems from a comparison with the Hengwrt MS 9 that Wynkyn de Worde attempted, with Hg or some other MS of almost equal excellence, to print what we today would call a diplomatic text. I have collated the Hg version of Sir Thopas with twenty printed editions, 10 and then checked the variants with Manly-Rickert's Corpus of Variants. My evidence will be brief and will be presented in the following order: 1. Headings and Endings (Incipits and Explicits) 2. Gloss 3. Punctuation 4. Paragraph symbols 5. Page composition 6. Text 1. Headings and Endings : Manly-Rickert (III, 528) state, "Headings and endings are of little value for classification: the members of b̰ and d̰ can be roughly grouped by this method." They have not included incipits and explicits in their Corpus of Variants, since this work was done very thoroughly by Sir William McCormick ( The Manuscripts of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales , 1933). The following is a comparison of Hg with Caxton 2nd edition, Wynkyn de Worde, Skeat, and Manly-Rickert-Robinson (as a group): After the Prioress's Tale : Hg: Bihoold the myrie talkyng of the Hoost to Chaucer Cx: Here foloweth the prologue of Chaucers Tale WdW: Here foloweth the prologe of comynynge of the Hoste to Chaucer Sk: Bihold the murye wordes of the Host to Chaucer M-R-Rb: Bihold the murye wordes of the Hoost to Chaucer (from Ellesmere) After line 2108, "Tyll on a day": Hg: Here the Hoost Stynteth Chaucer of his tale of Thopas and biddeth him telle another tale Cx: The hoost interrupteth his tale WdW: Here stynteth the hoste Chaucer of his tale of Syre Thopas and byddeth hym telle a nother tale (Hg with slight variation) Sk: Here the Host stinteth Chaucer of his Tale of Thopas M-R: Here the Hoost Stynteth Chaucer of his tale of Thopas and biddeth hym telle another tale (Hg) Rb: Here the Hoost stynteth Chaucer of his Tale of Thopas (Speght: The words of our Hoste; Urry: Here our Hoste interrupteth the Rime of Sir Thopas. No incipit for Tyrwhitt.) After line 2156: Hg: Here bigynneth Chaucers tale of Melibeus Cx: Sequitur Chawcers tale WdW: Here endyth the disputacyon by/twene the Hoste and Chaucer for tellynge of his tale in ryme of Syre Thopas. And after foloweth his tale of Melibeus in prose. M-R-Rb: Heere bigynneth Chaucers Tale of Melibee A careful search in McCormick of the 85 MSS and fragments of the Canterbury Tales extant has revealed only one MS which has any similarities with the edition of De Worde. This is Phillipps 6570 (Ph 1 ), a defective MS of 24 ff. containing a section of the Pardoner's Tale , part of Group B 2 , and part of the Parson's Tale . B.M. Additional MS 9832, which contains the Legend of Good Women , belongs to this same MS. Ph 1 shows the following incipits and explicits: [After the Prioress's Tale (l. 1880]: Biholde the myrie talkynge of the Hoost to Chaucer [After l. 2108]: Heere stynteth the Hoost Chaucer of his tale of Sire Thopas and biddeth hym telle another tale [After l. 2156]: Heere after folweth Chaucers tale of Melibee. It should be noted that Ph 1 also has the gloss at line 1884, a citation omitted in M-R . 11 In the light of the exact reprinting of an unknown manuscript by Wynkyn de Worde, his incipits and explicits would seem to be trustworthy enough to identify his manuscript if we had such information available. Ph 1 may have been involved in the descent of such a MS. It is obvious that De Worde did not follow Caxton except possibly in five words of the first incipit. 2. Gloss : Sir Topas has the gloss, ".i. Chaucer" above line 1884. This gloss is found in El, Hg, Ha 2 , Ht, La, Mc, Ph 1 , Ph 3 , Pw, Ry 1 and Se. Wynkyn de Worde is the only editor to print this gloss . 3. Punctuation : Wynkyn de Worde is the only editor who has attempted to reproduce accurately scribal punctuation . The virgules seen in MSS like Hg, El and others are reproduced by WdW with full points. Of the 276 lines of Sir Thopas , De Worde reproduces the Hg pointing exactly in 218 lines ; that is, 79% of the lines correspond, 21% diverge. Wynkyn de Worde has punctuation where Hg does not in 20 lines; Hg has punctuation where De Worde does not in 19 lines; De Worde has extra punctuation in 3 lines, and the rest show a divergency in punctuation placement. I have compared the variations of Wynkyn de Worde with the El pointing but find little consistent correspondence. 4. Paragraph symbols : The Caxton editions print Sir Thopas with no paragraphs, stanza indentations, or symbols. El, Hg, Ad 3 of the Variorum manuscripts use paragraph symbols ¶ to introduce each new 6 line stanza. Wynkyn de Worde corresponds to Hg here with only 7 exceptions: in lines 1888, 1895 De Worde uses a space where Hg has a paragraph symbol (here De Worde corresponds to El) and in lines 1897, 2050, 2068, 2090, and 2102 De Worde has superfluous paragraph symbols. 5. Page composition : Wynkyn de Worde is unique among all editors in printing Sir Thopas exactly as we find it in the better MSS , with the tail rhyme "b" lines to the right and slightly above the "a" lines. As noted above, the printer took unusual care to reproduce his manuscript exactly. The Caxton editions print the poem in a block and later editors in stanzas. None imitated the MS composition, and it is therefore obvious that only a MS set up in this fashion could have served Wynkyn de Worde as a base. 6. Text : My method has been to assign alphabetical letters to readings in the following way: a) WdW varies from Caxton but agrees with Hg. b) WdW varies from Caxton and varies from Hg. c) WdW agrees with Caxton but varies from Hg. It will be helpful to have these formulas in mind when surveying the following summary. I have noted spelling variations only if they are significant, including seemingly slight variations where WdW differs from Caxton but the Pynson editions agree. Absolute—one might be tempted to say "servile"—dependence on Caxton by both Pynson editions (even with De Worde intervening), has been proved definitely by my collation. Certain important lines will receive special treatment below. Summary: 1) In the 276 lines of Sir Thopas , Wynkyn de Worde agrees with Hengwrt (minor spelling variations excepted, but including paragraph symbols) in 238 lines (244 if paragraph sings or spaces are excluded). There is therefore an 86-88% correlation between Hg and WdW. 2) The number of lines in which WdW agrees with Hg but varies from Caxton is 90 or 33% of the lines. Four of these lines have two "a" readings, three have a "c" reading, and two have a "b" reading. There is, therefore, a total of 94 "a" readings. 3) The number of readings in which WdW agrees with Caxton but varies from Hg ("c" readings) is 16. Of these I consider only six (1912, 1923, 2017, 2021, 2048, 2113) as significant. These lines will be examined below. 4) The number of readings in which WdW varies from both Hg and Caxton ("b" readings, not including paragraph signs) is 16 (1902, 1921, 1926 , 1941 , 1972, 1984, 1993 , 2001, 2003 , 2013 , 2014 , 2038, 2050, 2077 , 2123, 2124). These include the four crucial tag lines out, and three other important signal lines, all italicized and examined below. 5) The total number of readings in which WdW varies from Caxton is 110, in 104 or 38% of the lines. Textual conclusions: Wynkyn de Worde did not use Caxton's second edition as a base for his own text of Sir Thopas although he may occasionally have referred to it (l. 1923). My information also shows that he usually anticipates or surpasses Tyrwhitt in better readings. The textual evidence corroborates the information concerning headings/endings, gloss, punctuation, paragraph symbols, and page composition to confirm WdW's independence of Caxton. Is it possible to identify the manuscript that Wynkyn de Worde used? Although there is an unusually large correspondence with Hengwrt, there are enough crucial discrepancies (the out tag lines among others) to eliminate this MS as De Worde's specific or only base. Using Manly-Rickert's Corpus of Variants, 12 I have examined the occurrence of the most important signal lines in WdW. 1884 ".i. Chaucer": El, Hg, Ha 2 , Ht, La, M̰c, Ph 1 , Ph 3 , Pw, Ry 1 , Se 1941 "bay": b̰, Gg, Ha 3 , li, Ph 1 (Cx 1 = bay) 2014 "Thyn hauberke shall I percen": El, Gg, Ha 2 , Ha 3 , He, Ii, Ph 1 (Speght 2,3 and Urry agree with WdW ( M-R , IV, 2014: "The addition of 'Thyn hauberk' was apparently made by the ancestor of El and copied by the other MSS which have it. It is to be rejected.") 2107 "worly": Ch, El, Hg, Ph 1 , ( WdW is the only editor to use this word ) The four tag lines: 1933 "so wilde" out: b̰, Ha 2 (added later by original scribe), Ii, La (added later by original scribe), Ma, Ry 2003 "with mace" out: Fi, Ha 2 , (added later by original scribe), Ra 2 2013 "Thy mawe" out: b̰, B̰o 1 , Ha 3 , Ii, Ma, M̰c, Ra 1 2077 "In londe" out: b̰, B̰o 1 , Bo 2 , Fi, Gl, Ha 2 , Ha 3 , Ii, Ma, Mc, Ra 3 , Sl 2 It will be noted that 3 of the 4 lines are out in b , Ii, Ha 2 , Ma. Ii also corresponds to lines 1941, 2014, and Ha 2 to lines 1884, 2014 above. Correspondence of "c" lines: 1912 "A Lord": b̰, Bo 2 , Dl, Ha 3 , M̰c, Mg, Ph 3 1923 "brydgys": No MS authority 2017 "drewe": No MS authority 2021 "it" omitted: b̰, Bo 1 , Ch, Ds, Gg, Ha 3 , Ht, Ii, Ph 1 , Se 2048 "a lake": C̰n, Ḛn 1 , Gl, Ox, Ra 3 , To Of 7 readings, there is a correspondence of 2 for b̰, Ha 3 , Se. From a total of 13 variants counted, b̰, Ha 3 and Ii show 6 correspondences, Ha 2 , Ph 1 show 5, M̰c shows 4, Bo 1 , El, Gg and Se show 3. However, only one of these MSS passes muster since all except one fail in one or more of at least three crucial ("a" line) points: 1) They lack the gloss at line 1884. 2) They write rode for glood at line 2094 (including El). 3) They have the final line 2108 "Tyll on a day" out. The one exception is Ph 1 , which, however, includes the tag lines. It must be concluded, therefore, that Wynkyn de Worde did not use any specific MS found in M-R Corpus of Variants as his base. It is, of course, possible that he omitted the four tag lines through the exigencies of his page composition 13 and/or that he conflated several MSS and attempted an eclectic edition. However, in light of his strict adherence to the peculiarities of text and diplomatic printing, this theory does not seem probable. And yet we should be able to determine the classification of the MS he used. The overwhelming correspondence with Hengwrt and the identification of the variants above lead one to believe that for the Sir Thopas section of his edition specifically (and possibly also for the other parts mentioned below) De Worde used a manuscript which figured in two of M-R 's seven lines of descent for this tale: 14 1) Hg-Bo 2 , Gg-Ph 1 -b̰* (b̰* = Ii-Ha 3 -b̰), and 2) El. The presence of b̰ in the first line of descent would correlate with some peculiar readings of De Worde from Caxton (l. 1923). In sum, Wynkyn de Worde may have used a "Hengwrt manqué," a slightly corrupt descendant of this fine manuscript. It must again be stressed here, that these conclusions go against all the other evidence assembled by most reputable scholars, past and present. De Worde's use of an excellent MS for his base, almost totally independent of Caxton's second edition, his unique and precise reproduction in print of a MS page and MS punctuation, his anticipation even of Tyrwhitt in better and accepted MSS readings has been noted in the Sir Thopas section of his edition of the Canterbury Tales . Here he must take his place with Tyrwhitt as one of the fathers of the editorial method. In this section he shows vast superiority to Pynson and certainly proves an exception to Greg's statement that, among the early editions, no print after Caxton's first was set up from manuscript. Pynson set up his editions from Caxton, and Thynne from Wynkyn de Worde, but Caxton's pupil, in this instance at least, was his own man. But why here? And was it here alone? It is enticing to attempt to answer these questions by stressing the nature, difficulties, and challenges of the parody of Sir Thopas . This tale was, after all, important as Chaucer the pilgrim's own contribution. Also, no other work of the Canterbury Tales demands so much from an intelligent printer-editor, and Wynkyn de Worde may have risen to the challenge and searched for the best base text. However, certain other facts of great interest, supplied to me by Mr. Howard Nixon, Librarian of Westminster Abbey, direct us to a less fanciful conclusion. I am very grateful for Mr. Nixon's permission to use his comments and shall quote from personal correspondence below. Mr. Nixon pointed out something obvious to anyone who does not neglect the forest for the tree, that Sir Thopas in this instance cannot be treated in isolation. The full points used there run through all of the Melibeus , Chaucer's prose tale, and they start shortly before the end of the Tale of the Prioress , which precedes the Prologue to Sir Thopas . The paragraphing in De Worde's Melibeus is different from Caxton's, and De Worde includes a six-line sentence at the head of the second column on r vi b which is lacking in Caxton. After the Melibeus , the Monk's Tale also seems to come from a source independent of Caxton as can be seen by the different order of the lives, for Caxton split up and rearranged the usual order of the Modern Instances. According to Nixon, "Caxton has the order which Chaucer probably intended, although it is not found in most of the best MSS. De Worde is evidently still following a manuscript of the Hengwrt group." In sum, it is obvious that part of the Tale of the Prioress , Sir Thopas , the Melibeus , and the Monk's Tale are all set from a manuscript and not from Caxton's edition. The reason for this involves another puzzle, and this in turn has led Howard Nixon to propose a solution which seems, under the circumstances, eminently sane and logical. Incidentally, there is a bibliographical problem to be solved here. De Worde has a five-leaf section, u (not v, as Duff [E. Gordon Duff, The Printers, Stationers, and Bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476 to 1535 . Cambridge, 1906.] says), which starts in the middle of the Monk's Tale , 4 stanzas before the change in the order of the lives, by suddenly going into single column on u 1 a and u 1 b , then returning to double column on u 2. The Monk's Tale concludes on u 4 a and the Nun's Priest's Tale begins on u 4 b , continuing on u 5 a and b and then straight on to x 1. Some very odd miscalculations must have been made, possibly because for this portion De Worde had both Caxton and his MS. For I am fairly certain that the reason for this sudden 'improvement' in De Worde's editorial method was that his copy of Caxton's second edition—which had been probably lying around the shop at the Red Pale for the last fourteen years—was defective at this point. De Worde had therefore to find a MS and print from that. And judging by the sudden appearance of the punctuation points in the Tale of the Prioress in the last stanza on r 1 a of the De Worde edition, the defect began with a torn leaf ii 1 in Caxton, for this stanza is the fourth on the recto of that leaf. After that the whole of Sir Thopas , Melibeus , and the Monk's Tale may have been missing or De Worde's compositor may have gone on setting from the manuscript until he was told to stop. We are left finally with the undeniable fact that De Worde was careful to choose a very good manuscript from a fine tradition for his text to replace Caxton, and that he has established himself thereby as the only printer who ever set up a page according to a rather complicated manuscript composition. In addition, no editor but he has ever accurately reproduced scribal pointing. Wynkyn de Worde has been a much maligned old elephant, and he is long overdue some small place in the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am indebted to the Rackham Foundation, University of Michigan, for a summer grant to pursue this project. [1] Wynkyn de Worde (de Worth) was born in Wörth, Alsace, in the Duchy of Lorraine. Possibly, he was with Caxton in Bruges and accompanied him to England in 1476. He stayed with Caxton until Caxton's death in 1491, whereupon he assumed control of the business. Wynkyn de Worde was the first printer in England to use italic type, 1524. He died 1534/35. 2 Henry R. Plomer, Wynkyn de Worde and his Contemporaries (1925), pp. 44, 61, 101. 3 The confusion ranges from the number of titles Wynkyn de Worde printed, to an evaluation of his work. Thus, in one volume, the Encyclopaedia Britannica (15th ed., 1974) mentions that the printer published at least 600 books after 1501 ("Whereas Caxton and numerous continental European contemporaries were also editors and translators, Wynkyn was purely a commercial printer"). In another volume of the same edition he is given credit for some 800 titles ("His contemporary, the best of the early printers, was Richard Pynson of Normandy"). Collier's Encyclopedia reduces the number of books to "more than 700" but also praises Pynson (Plomer [pp. 8, 149] would agree): "A London contemporary, Richard Pynson, easily outdid all English rivals in the quality of work during the early 16th century." The Encyclopedia Americana , vol. 29 (1965) doubles Wynkyn de Worde's publications: "He published more than 700 distinct works known through at least one copy or fragments, although this probably represents only half of his total output." 4 Thomas R.

Hammond, Chaucer: A Bibliographical Manual (1908, reprinted 1933), p. 204. For the sake of convenience I am using the standard MS abbreviations found in John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of The Canterbury Tales (1940), Vols. II-VIII (cited hereafter as M-R ), and the edition of F. N. Robinson, The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , 2nd edition (1957), pp. 886-887. The Corpus of Variants is found in M-R vols. V-VIII. 7 Professor Thomas Ross kindly supplied me with a list of 28 variants from the Miller's Tale in which Wynkyn de Worde differs from Caxton. In general, these do not seem significant and there is no consistent pattern of MS reading, though Ha 4 does occur often. He notes that several Caxton typos are repeated by Wynkyn de Worde. General dependence on Caxton, with occasional separate readings, is definitely proved. 8 The line references throughout are those of M-R and F. N. Robinson. 9 Hengwrt MS (Peniarth 392 D) found at Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, forms the text of the Variorum Chaucer . It is with the El the earliest MS of Chaucer extant (1400-10), possibly contemporary with the poet, and is in many cases superior to El. M-R 's eclectic text by recension is practically identical to Hg. It is conjectured that El and Hg were written by the same scribe ( M-R , I, 268). 10 The editions are: Caxton, ca. 1478; Caxton, ca. 1485; Pynson, ca. 1492; Wynkyn de Worde, 1498; Pynson, 1526; Thynne, 1532, Thynne, 1542; Thynne, 1545; Stow, 1561; Speght, 1598; Speght, 1602; Speght, 1687; Urry, 1721; Tyrwhitt, 1775-8; Tyrwhitt, 1798; Wright, 1847-51; Skeat, 1894; Robinson, 1933; Manly-Rickert, 1940; Robinson, 1957. 11 McCormick, p. 554. 12 M-R have their own symbols for what they call "constant groups," that is, MSS whose variants usually appear together. Several of these, used below, are: 1) b̰=He—N̰e (Ne—C̰x 1 ) where C̰x 1 =C̰x 1 —Tc 2 ; 2) B̰o 1 =Bo 1 —Ph 2 ; 3) Ḛn 1 =En 1 —Ds; 4) M̰c=Mc—Ra 1 . 13 There is, for one thing, little space left in the right margin, and WdW may have felt the tag lines to be scribal excrescences: lines 1993, 2003, 2077 are not really necessary, and 2013 has been made superfluous by "Thyn hauberke" of line 2014. If this were so, MS Ph 1 would obviously gain in importance. 14 M-R , VIII, 181.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Flash of the Comet: The Typographical Career of Samuel N. Dickinson by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the name of Samuel N. Dickinson appears in the literature of nineteenth century printing, it is usually in reference to only a few of his many achievements. To De Vinne, he was a master printer who became a typefounder and introduced the Scotch face. 1 The American Dictionary of Printing and Bookmaking finds this aspect of Dickinson memorable and then states that his book, A Help to Printers and Publishers , was for many years "an indispensable one in all printing-offices." 2 Bigmore &amp; Wyman refer to only two items: A Help to Printers and Publishers and his 1842 specimen book. 3 Yet here was a man regarded by his contemporaries as one of the best printers in the United States. In addition to his typefoundry, he owned one of the largest printing offices in the country, issued one of the first American technological journals, produced the first American periodical devoted to printing, compiled and printed a well-known series of almanacs, and was astute enough to discover and employ such men as Henry O. Houghton and the two John Wilsons. Unfortunately Dickinson's career ended in less than twenty years. Perhaps if he had lived long enough to have become venerable, he would have received greater attention from historians of printing. To recount all of his various activities in one straight chronological narrative would blur and distort the picture. Therefore, after a brief biographical sketch, his work as printer, typefounder, and publisher will be discussed separately. Samuel Nelson Dickinson, seventh child of Nancy Pullen Dickinson and Cotton Dickinson, was born in Phelps, Ontario County, New York, on 11 December 1801. 4 His grandfather, Colonel Elias Dickinson, had been one of the original purchasers of Phelps. 5 His father's principal occupation cannot be definitely ascertained although transactions recorded in the County Clerk's office disclose that, from time to time, he sold land. Less than three years after Samuel's birth, his father was killed "while in the act of raising the first Presbyterian Church in Phelps." 6 The father's death left the family poorly off, but the young orphan was able to acquire an elementary education. And when, about the age of twelve, he cut his name on wood and printed it in his spelling book, the family realized that he had found his profession. He was soon apprenticed to Stephen Young, printer of the Geneva Palladium . After Young's death in 1816, young Samuel went to New York City where he worked for a year or two before moving to Boston. There he found a job with the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry (Coolidge and Wiley, p. 3). Of all possible places for training, Dickinson wittingly or unwittingly chose the best. During those years, the employees of the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry included James Conner, Edward Pelouze, Michael Dalton, and Edwin Starr, all of whom later became distinguished typefounders. 7 In this stimulating environment the talented young man applied himself single-mindedly. He "was accustomed to transfer the materials of his employment to his lodgings, and while others sought relaxation from labor, would pursue his avocation into the hours of the night." (Coolidge and Wiley, p. 3). His ambition to own a printing shop was realized in 1829 when he resigned and rented two small rooms at 52 Washington Street, Boston. As business thrived, it expanded into adjoining rooms until the printing shop and typefoundry (added in 1840) comprised twelve large rooms covering more than an acre (Coolidge and Wiley, p. 3). This was accomplished while Dickinson's personal life was affected by a tragedy and increasingly poor health. His first wife, Sarah Ann Oliver, whom he married in 1830, and their seven-week-old daughter died within a day of each other in 1833 ([Boston] Columbian Centinel , 1 Sept. 1830; 3 Aug. 1833). Three years later, he married Mrs. Mary Parker ( Columbian Centinel , 20 July 1836). In January and February, 1847, his health declined so remorselessly that he spent four weeks in New York consulting a "Botanic Physician" for his throat and lungs. 8 He repeated the visit one month later (Dickinson to Geer, 16 March 1847). By September, his illness necessitated the sale of his printing office ([Boston] Daily Evening Transcript , 14 Sept. 1847). A trip to Florida during the winter failed to improve his condition sufficiently to enable him to continue the typefoundry (C. C. P. Moody to Geer, 9 Dec. 1847). It was sold in 1848 ([Boston] Daily Evening Traveller , 12 Aug. 1848). He finished one final task, the preparation of copy for the 1849 Boston Almanac , before he died of "consumption" on 16 December 1848 ( Daily Evening Traveller , 18 Dec. 1848).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Printer By the end of 1829, Dickinson had equipped his shop and was ready to solicit orders for printing. The first announcement succinctly described his objectives and policies: SAMUEL N. DICKINSON, having established himself in the Printing Business in this city, would respectfully inform the public that he has opened an office at No. 52, Washington-street, (6 doors north of State-street,) where he has a choice selection of Type, and other apparatus, adapted to the printing of Books, Newspapers, Catalogues, Circulars, Checks, Cards &amp; c. In soliciting patronage, he engages that his work shall be executed in as good style, and on as reasonable terms, as at any other establishment in the city. His materials are selected from the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry, and are among the best specimens for neatness and elegance that can be procured. Gentlemen disposed to favour his establishment with their patronage, may depend on having their work done with punctuality, with the nicest accuracy, and according to the terms of contract. Refer to Messrs. H. J. Oliver. J. G. Rogers, and Rev. Silas Blaisdale Boston, Dec. 9. 9 At least two of his three references had a personal interest in the success of this venture. Henry J. Oliver, Boston merchant, became his father-in-law nine months later and John G. Rogers was the agent of the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry. 10 The third reference, Reverend Silas Blaisdale, taught at the Salem Street Academy. 11 Obviously Dickinson was starting on his own without much encouragement from the businessmen of Boston. Throughout his career, he always attempted to obtain the best and latest equipment, announcing these acquisitions proudly in advertisements and publications which now provide some information about his facilities. Five months after he opened his office, he published an article about one of his presses. In this press, invented by Samuel Couillard, Jr., but manufactured by Phineas Dow, the platen was raised and lowered by "progressive levers" (toggle joints). 12 The article describes the Dow Press and then goes on to compare it with Clymer's Columbian Press. Because such contemporary comparisons are rare, the following excerpts are reprinted: Mr. Phinehas (sic) Dow, of this city, has, we think, been very successful in applying these progressive levers. He has contrived to place the fulcrum of the lever on the near side, thus bringing the bar-handle nearer to the pressman, and also the advantage of not extending an awkward distance out from the press. Mr. D., however, is not alone in this particular, others, have appended the bar to the near side of their presses, also; but, whether they have done it in so compact a manner admits of considerable doubt. For ourselves, we can say we never saw a press fold up so snugly, (if we may be allowed the term,) as that of Mr. D. But, its most striking feature is its simplicity; we believe it would be impossible to construct a press with less machinery. The bar or lever, is 36 inches long, from the extreme end to the centre of motion; from this centre, and at a right angle with the bar, is a short arm, to which a pitman is attached; the short arm is 2¼ inches long, and extends towards the back of the press; the pitman terminates in a ball, which acts in a socket near the top of the lower toggle; of course the toggles are pushed, and not drawn, as in other presses. Those parts giving the pressure are brought in straight lines at the greatest stress, consequently no spring, and but little friction, are important advantages in this press. * * * * * * * * Mr. Clymer's press, in its day, was considered an acquisition to a printing office, and no doubt it was; but, far otherwise is the case at present. In the perspective, the eye is struck with rather an agreeable picture; but, as beauty is not always indicative of superiour worth, so with this press; it may be classified with the beautiful , but not among the useful . . . . It is well known that a simple, and yet efficient, machine, always possesses decided advantages over a complicated one. . . . But, exclusive of its intricateness, we have other objections to Mr. Clymer's press. Such as its liability to accident, because of its overmuch machinery; and, (what we think a serious one,) the movement of the platen; in the perspective the platen is seen attached to the main lever by means of a piston, which piston slides between two projections from either of the inner sides of the press; these projections are grooved at the ends, and are intended to guide the piston in its perpendicular motion, but of this they fail; for the piston being made fast, as above stated, to the main lever, and this lever rising only at one end, (the other being secured to the near side of the press,) does not, of course, give an accurate perpendicular movement to the platen, the consequence of which is, that a clear impression is not easily obtained. 13 The earliest items printed by Dickinson were products of a skilled craftsman. He did excellent tabular work, as in the Report of the School Committee , Boston, 1829, and, during the next year, he demonstrated his ability to handle texts and lists in such publications as a report of the Boston Mechanics Institution (1830) and the Act of Incorporation of the Bunker Hill Monument Association. In addition to other works and job printing throughout the 1830's, he began printing books for publishers. Dickinson's production of John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education in 1830 for Gray &amp; Bowen must have pleased them; two years later, they selected him to print The Token (1833), one of the most distinguished American literary annuals. Another recognition of his craftsmanship is manifest in the choice of Dickinson to print the 1835 specimen book of the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry. In six years, he had established himself as a highly respected and successful printer, enjoying an increasing amount of business. The possibility of attaining better presswork led Dickinson to design modifications on the presses he purchased. One of the early alterations appeared so promising that he applied for a patent. This patent, for an improvement in the machinery for printing, was granted on 19 November 1833. Because of the fire in 1836, no copy survives in the Patent Office, but the patent was epitomized soon after it was granted: The improvements here described are applied to the hand printing press, and the first of them is intended to remove the defect occasioned by the falling of the inking roller, as it is usually constructed, into the quadrats, or spaces, between the pages of matter; the impressions being usually rendered imperfect by its pressing more forcibly on the type at the sides than at other places, as it falls into, and rises from, these spaces. To obviate this, there are to be wheels, on the gudgeons of the inking rollers, which may be of the same diameter as the rollers themselves, and these are to bear, and run upon, ways, adapted to them. These ways are so constructed as to sink down when the tympan is brought upon the form, and to rise when it is raised; for this purpose, the tympan is furnished with a tail piece on each of its lower angles, which, when it is thrown up, act upon a system of levers, and produce the effect of raising the rails: the inking rollers are then conducted over the form with regularity. The second improvement consists in a particular arrangement of the inking apparatus, intended to equalize, and facilitate, the distribution of the ink. This it would be difficult to describe without a drawing, and we, therefore, shall not make the attempt. The claim is to the application of a system of levers to the bed, to be acted upon by projecting pieces on the lower angles of the tympan, which raise parallel rails for the purpose described; and to the mode of applying the ink fountain for distributing and equalizing the ink. 14 It is to be regretted that there is not even a clue to the method of distributing and equalizing the ink. That "it would be difficult to describe without a drawing" prompts one to speculate that Dickinson may have utilized the principle of the revolving disk. The origin of the press most closely associated with Dickinson has, until now, remained obscure. His 1839 Boston Almanac contained this announcement: S. N. D. would respectfully inform his friends and the public, that having purchased the right of use, for the city of Boston, of the Rotary Press, he intends to direct his whole attention to this branch of Printing. The Rotary Press will introduce a new era in Card Printing, for from its construction it is capable of printing a greater number of Cards, in a given time, and of the most beautiful execution, than any other machine. Cards are a ready and convenient medium of information, and would undoubtedly be used to a greater extent than they have been, were they obtained at lower prices. With these machines they can be furnished so low, that the barrier of a high price may be said to be entirely removed — a thousand handsome cards being furnished for four or five dollars. Rail Road tickets printed with great despatch, and at a great saving to the proprietors. 15 Despite the fact that the Rotary Press bears a striking resemblance to George P. Gordon's Firefly Press, Henry L. Bullen said that Stephen P. Ruggles built the Rotary Press for Dickinson. 16 Two pieces of evidence prove Bullen to be incorrect. The first, Gordon's patent of 1852 for the Firefly Press, acknowledges that it is an adaptation of a press patented by C. F. Voorhies on 8 April 1834 (U.S. Patent No. 9,234). The second is Dickinson's own statement in his Boston Almanac . Under date of 1 August in "Memoranda of Events in Boston, during the year, 1838," he listed: "The Rotary Press, invented by Mr. C. F. Voorhies, of New York, first introduced into Boston, by S. N. Dickinson, with which one person can print at the rate of 2000 cards per hour." 17 Dickinson found the Rotary Press so promising that although he had originally purchased the right of use for the city of Boston, he decided to promote and sell it in a larger territory. Answering a query about the press from Elihu Geer, Hartford printer, in 1841, Dickinson described his marketing plans: At length I am able to give you some information about the Rotary. I have arranged matters so that I can go on and build, I think. I wish you to let me know exactly what you will expect of me for five hundred Dollars. I have had to take it at a hard bargain, and how I shall make out with it I do not know. It is undoubtedly the very best press in existence (if a press can exist.) I think you said you would not like to have one of them so near you as New Haven. I think if I could dispose of two in your state, I should be satisfied. One at Norwich would be far enough, I presume from your interests. And here I should like to plant one. 18 In response, Geer asked for a trial period of six months before deciding whether to buy. Dickinson replied: I find that will not work, for I cannot get them built to my satisfaction unless I pay the cash. The man that would build is a poor man, and must have his money. If I got them built by wholesale machinists they would never work to a certainty. If you have one, and I at the same time give up Springfield for the present, or for a year or so, it must be on the following terms. Four quarterly payments of 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 months. The last being the smallest, and your Yankee turned in after the Rotary is fairly set a-going. 19 Geer agreed to buy the press which was delivered within three months, but even before the press arrived, Dickinson encouraged his customer to dispose of the Yankee Card Press: "to throw a damper on their zeal here, by seeing one of them thrown out of use, and offered for sale. This would have a grand effect for me" (Dickinson to Geer, 15 May 1841). Geer used his Rotary Press for about one month before he notified Dickinson that the Yankee Card Press was for sale. Dickinson then insured a "grand effect" by paying Geer six dollars to advertise its sale in three Boston newspapers. 20 An aggressive sales campaign for the Rotary Press yielded results. One was probably placed in New York where the "Office of the Rotary Press" conducted business in 1841. 21 At Philadelphia, A. H. Simmons &amp; Co. advertised that they had purchased "Dickinson's Improved Rotary Card Press" ( Dollar Newspaper , 13 Sept. 1843). The campaign also reached westward. When he shipped the press to Geer, Dickinson wrote, "I could have sold it this week, and had it on its way to Columbus Ohio." And then, taking a slap at the sales methods of the inventor of the Yankee Card Press, he added "But the Orcut principle did not seem to suit me" (Dickinson to Geer, 19 May 1841). Dickinson's 1841 Boston Almanac contained a five-page catalogue of work that could be done and articles that could be found at his printing office. It revealed that, at the end of 1840, he was equipped to print newspapers, books, and pamphlets in English, French, or Spanish. Job work extended from cards to show bills in type from Diamond to 60-line Pica. Printing in color, gold printing, embossing, zylographic printing, and engraving were also available. He used "about a dozen different kinds of Printing Presses" in the approximately hundred-foot-long office on Washington Street. 22 His passion for self-respect and the respect of his world asserted itself without a lull. In 1841, while he enthusiastically used and sold the Rotary Press, he purchased the Boston right for the Ruggles Engine Press which was patented in 1840 (U.S. Patent No. 1,851). Because this card and job press had the horizontal type form above the horizontal platen, it became known as the Upside Down Press. 23 Soon Ruggles advertised that two of these presses were "constantly running" in Dickinson's office ( Boston Morning Post , 15 June 1841). Dickinson, in one of his own advertisements, declared that he "will avail himself of all new facilities for executing work—facilities which the inventive genius of our countrymen is constantly producing and improving—as far as honorably he can, either by fair purchase or free permission from the inventors" ( Boston Daily Times , 1 July 1841). Another advertisement specified some of the other new facilities: a steam engine, several new inking apparatuses, a new cylinder engine for job work, a hydrostatic press for giving printed work a "most beautiful gloss and finish," two new power presses, as well as new type, flowers, and cuts being received via steamers from Liverpool ( New England Puritan , 11 Nov. 1841). To be known as the owner of the shop with the best equipment did not suffice; he made the shop itself express his fervor for his craft. He was, he told the public, the first in Boston "to arrange and systematize a Printing Office in such a manner as to leave impressions of respect and delight upon the minds of those whose business or fancy led them to visit the modern 'Printing House'" ( New England Puritan , 5 May 1842). His achievement earned him the admiration of his fellow-craftsmen. In 1841, examples of his job work won a silver medal at the third exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. 24 When he displayed examples at the next exhibition in 1844, the judges concluded their comment with a note of appreciation: "The Committee consider Mr. Dickinson entitled to much credit for his efforts to advance the Art." 25 On another page of the catalogue, after a description of his display of specimens of plate-printing by direct pressure instead of a roller, the committee gave him "great praise, for his enterprise and skill, in introducing this improvement" ( Fourth Exhibition , p. 141). This display also contained a book of his embossed cards, produced on a press made by Ruggles, which the committee also approved. With the press, they said, "and with the aid of Mr. Mitchell, the Seal Cutter and Die Sinker, . . . he has brought the art to a high degree of perfection; in which, he has, as yet, been excelled by none, though many others have since engaged in the business." 26 The combined display was awarded a silver medal. Book and periodical publishers also became aware of his ability; he had already started to print for such firms as Crocker &amp; Brewster and William D. Ticknor and, until 1844, he printed the New England Puritan . 27 By 1845, Dickinson was printer, publisher, stereotyper, and typefounder. The expanding volume of business was too large to be closely supervised by one person. On 1 April, Dickinson admitted Charles C. P. Moody, one of his chief assistants, as a co-partner under the firm name of S. N. Dickinson &amp; Co. 28 Moody probably managed the printing department while Dickinson devoted most of his attention to the typefoundry. Dickinson's pride in the book and job printing establishment which he created is apparent in his description of the shop as it turned out work in 1845: The Office of the Rotary Press covers an area of 14,283 square feet, embracing 15 rooms. It is lighted by day, by 1,654 squares of glass, set in 100 different windows; and by night, by gas shooting up from 100 different burners. In these premises we have 1 steam engine of ten-horse power, 3 Adams's power presses, 2 Napier presses, 3 rotary presses, 2 Ruggles's job presses, 11 hand presses, 2 copper-plate presses, 2 embossing presses, 1 hydraulic press, 4 standing presses, 1 small power press, 2 paper cutters, 3 card cutters, 1 ink mill, and 4 machines for shaving stereotype plates, two of which are moved by steam power. We have more than 400 different styles of types; borders, flowers and cuts of various sorts—in weight 30,000 pounds. These are all held in their places by means of 866 type cases, 50 brass galleys, 200 feet standing galleys, 330 chases, and 3 bushels of quoins. We have two large cisterns, which contain about 1,000 gallons, or upwards of 18 hogsheads of water. This is distributed through every part of the office, by means of 500 feet of lead pipe. We use six hogsheads of water per day, which, supposing it were brought in buckets, would take one man 13½ hours each day to furnish, allowing him to bring four gallons every ten minutes. Our various presses throw off in the course of the year, six million , sixty-nine thousand , four hundred and eighty sheets of paper , or 12,645 reams. Supposing each sheet to be but 2½ feet long, and that they were placed in one continuous line, they would stretch out to 15,173,700 feet, or nearly 2,875 miles, about the distance from here to Europe. It is computed that we have printed the past year 138,240,000 pages of books, 64,000 circulars, 25,000 commercial and lawyers' blanks, 20,000 bank checks, 50,000 billets, 500,000 bill-heads, 300,000 shop-bills and hand-bills, and 2,000,000 of labels. We have cut up, printed, embossed and sold 1,201,520 cards, or 24,030 packs. Our average consumption of coal is over 2 tons a week, or more than 100 tons a year. Besides our 100 gas burners, we use about 150 gallons of oil for extra lights and machinery. For our various printing it takes 1,200 pounds of ink per annum, besides gold leaf, bronze and size. In our type and stereotype foundry, we have used the past year 50,000 pounds of metal, and turned out 7,000 stereotype plates, of various sizes and shapes. In our whole establishment, we employ usually about 100 hands, and it is safe to conclude that our office affords direct sustenance to at least 500 persons. 29 The great variety of typographical activities under one roof provided excellent training for ambitious employees. William Filmer, one of the first and best-known electrotypers, arrived from England at the age of seventeen and commenced his American career working for Dickinson. 30 Soon after graduation from the University of Vermont, Henry O. Houghton was hired by Dickinson who quickly discerned his capability. After a short time as compositor, Houghton was promoted to proofreader, a position which the delighted young man told his parents was "about the highest notch as to dignity in a Printing office." 31 Men of unquestionable ability like the two successful English printers, John Wilson and his son of the same name, who had immigrated to Boston in 1846, were immediately taken on, the father as proofreader, the son as compositor. Towards the end of a year, they resigned to found one of the best of the nineteenth century American printing firms. 32 A charming tribute to Dickinson as employer appeared in 1842. George Coolidge who began as apprentice and rose to foreman wrote and printed a romantic description in verse of the shop and typefoundry. This small forty-four page pamphlet, signed "A Votary," is dedicated to Dickinson, "as an humble tribute of esteem, and a grateful memento of the invaluable means of mechanical acquisition experienced during a long continuance in his extensive Printing House." 33 The year 1846 marked the summit of Dickinson's career for, as the year ended, his health began to decline and he could no longer continue his constant, intensive activity. The co-partnership with Charles C. P. Moody expired by limitation on 1 April 1847. Dickinson again assumed complete financial responsibility, but the formal announcement pointed out that Moody would remain, attending chiefly to the printing department while Dickinson devoted his attention principally to the typefounding department ( Daily Evening Transcript , 15 May 1847). This stop-gap arrangement ended in September when Dickinson sold his "extensive Printing Office, Book Bindery, and Card Embossing department" to Damrell &amp; Moore. 34 Nevertheless the name of Dickinson did not disappear in the Boston printing industry. When Damrell &amp; Moore moved to Devonshire Street in 1848, they referred to their firm as "The Dickinson Printing and Binding Establishment." 35 And when Charles C. P. Moody leased the original premises at 52 Washington Street, his shop name was "The Old Dickinson Printing Office." 36</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Typefounder The years at the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry nurtured Dickinson's fascination with the design and manufacture of printing type. Undoubtedly he set up his own printing office with the intention of eventually establishing his own typefoundry when sufficient time and money were available. From the moment he began to print on his own, interest in type equalled, if not exceeded, his occupation with new printing machinery. One can infer that, when he opened his printing office, his former employers were not aware of this intention. Otherwise they would not have encouraged him. According to Dickinson's first announcement, his "choice selection of Type, and other apparatus" were "selected from the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry" ( Boston Daily Advertiser , 9 Dec. 1829). And, it will also be remembered, his references included the Foundry's agent. However, the limited assortment of faces produced by his sponsor frustrated his ambition to own a large stock. Purchases from other foundries gradually mounted to the time when he could advertise that a "selection of the very best has been made from the London and Paris Foundries, so that his Office presents as great a variety of Type as can be found in any other Office in America." 37 In 1841, he catalogued the massive inventory of more than 285 varieties, including wood type, in his Specimen of Printing Type in S. N. Dickinson's Office, Boston . Meanwhile he had planned to become a typefounder. He may have begun, as David Bruce, Jr., recalled many years later, in 1840 with faces which "were selected from the punches of David Bruce, Jr., Williams-burgh, L. I., and the molds and fitting under the direction of Mr. Michael Dalton, executed by Mr. Edwin Starr and Son, Philadelphia." 38 The fact that the firm of Edwin Starr &amp; Son did not exist at that time discredits the accuracy of Bruce's memory. The other statements in his recollection await verification. According to De Vinne, Dickinson's dislike of available faces prompted him to send his designs for a new face, modeled in 1837, to Alexander Wilson &amp; Son, Edinburgh, where punches were cut and matrices shipped to him two years later. The face, said De Vinne, is the face now known as Scotch (De Vinne, p. 104). De Vinne gave no source for this information and, since he was only twenty years old at the time of Dickinson's death, he must have heard it indirectly. That there is some truth in it is apparent in Dickinson's own statements. The first, written in 1842, disclosed that he did pay great attention to design: The subscriber has the gratification to announce that in addition to his heretofore extensive facilities for Book and Job printing, he has added the very important item of Casting his own Type. This step enables him to keep his office abundantly supplied with type of the best and newest cut. The type for book work, already got up, presents the most beautiful faces that can be found in the country. Authors and others interested, are requested particularly to examine the Bourgeois, Long Primer, Small Pica, and Pica. The Small Pica was cut a year or two since, but previously to being fitted up for the subscriber's use, many of the letters were re-cut, and others re-touched; and, after a thorough revision, it was pronounced perfect. 39 The second, one year later, acknowledged that the Wilsons did punch-cutting for him: The present edition of the Boston Almanac is printed upon type cast at the Foundry and Printing Establishment of S. N. Dickinson, 52 Washington St. The letter was cut by the Messrs. WILSONS, of Edinburgh. The Scotch cut letter is proverbial for its durability, and it is hoped, from the appearance of the type itself in this little volume, it may also become proverbial for its beauty. 40 By 1844, his successful introduction of this face tempted him to offer to design other faces: At a very great expense he has obtained Scotch Matrices, which enable him to manufacture type as perfect in every respect as can be obtained at the celebrated Wilson Foundry in Edinburgh. The Boston Daily Atlas is printed by S. N. D. on type from the Scotch Matrices. The style of letter for the Advertisements in that paper was projected by Mr. Dickinson. And he will be happy to furnish similar type for other papers, or he will devise entire new styles, if required. 41 With his well-equipped printing shop conveniently at hand, Dickinson made two grand flourishes in publicizing the typefoundry which he said "commenced in 1840." 42 He used his new type in The Works of Nathanael Emmons, D. D. , six octavo volumes printed for Crocker &amp; Brewster in 1842. Then he proceeded to distribute some of the copies himself. The copy in the Boston Public Library has a printed card which includes the recipient's name in print: "Presented as a token of respect to the Hon. Abbot Lawrence; also as a specimen of printing, From Type Manufactured at the Printing Establishment of his humble serv't, Samuel N. Dickson. Boston, June 1st, 1842." Reviewers also received copies with the result that, in his 1844 Boston Almanac , Dickinson printed excerpts from a dozen journals, all praising the new type (1844 Boston Almanac , pp. 173-75). The other flourish, Specimen of Type for Book Printing, Manufactured by Samuel N. Dickinson , issued in 1842, is not a mere series of alphabets. Its thirty-five leaves contain an assortment of complete book pages. Thus, for example, Brevier is seen in three 32mo. pages—solid, thin leaded, and leaded, in an 18mo. page, solid, in a 12mo. page, thin leaded, in three 8vo. pages—leaded, solid, and double column solid. There are also displays of Nonpareil, Minion, Bourgeois, Long Primer, Small Pica, and Pica. Dickinson also provided specimen sheets showing complete alphabets in roman and italic as well as numerals. The first paragraph of his introductory statement expressed his feeling for style and elegance: The following pages present a fair specimen of the Book type manufactured by S. N. Dickinson. His object in commencing this branch of business, was to insure a handsome form of letter, and to be enabled to keep his Printing Office supplied with an abundance of new and perfect type. Much expense and no little care have been the consequence of this step. But so far all things have worked well, and given him great satisfaction in the appearance of such works as have been printed from the new type. If a parent feels pride in the perfect symmetry and proportions of his offspring, no less pleasurable are the feelings of the Printer, on beholding the beautiful productions of his press. Old type, and that of questionable form and cut, can never afford him this honest and heartfelt satisfaction. 43 Dickinson's enjoyment in creating a successful typefoundry was soon disturbed by rumors of a revolutionary development in the industry. Word spread that the new process of electrotyping could be utilized to produce matrices from cast type or punches, thereby permitting any typefounder to reproduce any face at very low cost. Moreover, new designs could be produced without the expense of a punchcutter. A passage in a letter to Elihu Geer implies that Dickinson conducted some experiments toward this end: When you receive the three kinds of Eng. type, . . . I want you to send me just one letter of each, one of each point, and be sure that you select those that are perfect . I have made some successful experiments with new Eng. type, and perhaps I can with these. If I do, I can afford afterwards to give you a small font of each. Be sure that you select perfect letters—examine them with a glass . I do not let any one know that I have been making experiments, and therefore I wish you to keep perfectly dark about it. Knowing your discretion in such matters, I feel that you will keep the thing entirely to yourself. 44 If Dickson did electrotype faces, it was a covert operation; he advertised his stereotype foundry, but made no mention of electrotyping. In addition to intense price competition, typefounders had to contend with pilferage of designs. In the same letter to Geer, Dickinson discussed the unreasonableness of price-cutting as well as his resentment against those who plundered his ideas: Geo Bruce advertises type at 5 or 6&amp;c.nt; less per lb all through the sizes, than he has heretofore been selling at. He is an old fool, and to spite his neighbor would bite his own nose off. He does not seem to see that other founders will fall down to his prices, and that in such an event, he will sell no more than he now does, or if he should sell a little more, still his receipts would in all probability amt to less, because of the reduction in price. Another bad thing about it will be an opening of many doors for a host of adventurous Printers to try their hand at the business, because they can get their type so much cheaper, etc. Old George cannot last forever, and his mischief will probably die with him. I have made arrangements with the Wilson's, of Edinburgh, for matrices, and soon I expect to have something from them that will make your mouth water. It will be some months first. But I will let you know when I receive any thing. This , too, I want kept a perfect secret, for should it become known, some of our enterprizing founders would not rest till they too had gotten some thing from England, or from somewhere else. After launching his book type, he sought out and attracted another market: newspaper type. In 1846, the Boston Daily Evening Traveller announced that its "new and elegant typographical dress" was commenced with a complete suit of type from Dickinson ( Daily Evening Traveller , 1 April 1846). Only two sizes, Minion and Agate, were used because "the less the number of fonts, . . . used in the printing of a daily paper, the less the liability of getting the type mixed by the compositors, which in the hurry of getting the paper ready for press, is not of unfrequent occurrence" ( Daily Evening Traveller , 28 April 1846). Yet, the editors pointed out, because of Dickinson's perseverance and skill and unsparing expense, "we are enabled to give our news and editorial articles, as much diversity of feature, as though we had three or four kinds of type for the purpose." In a letter printed in the Daily Evening Traveller , Dickinson affirmed to the public that his faces were intended for a particular use: "For Book Printing, we have been as careful to select faces that we consider appropriate, as we have in the selection of appropriate faces for Newspaper Printing" (28 April 1846). Type for books and newspapers comprised only a part of the typefoundry's output. Leads, brass rules, furniture, ornaments of various styles and sizes, borders, vignettes, Greek type, and phonotype were among the other products. In 1846, Dickinson celebrated his achievement by preparing a Hand-Book Specimen of Printing Type, Cuts, Ornaments, Etc . The contents of this volume of almost 190 leaves must have been a complete display. The preface, dated January, 1847, stated that the Scotch faces (more than a dozen varieties) "were selected from the very extensive Foundry of Alexander Wilson &amp; Sons of Edinburgh, and also from an eminent letter cutter of that city" ( Hand-Book , l. 1). It concluded with a regretful sentence: "There are only three kinds of American cutting exhibited among these Book and News founts, viz: English, Pica No. 1, and Small Pica No. 1; but they are considered by many as very handsome." The preface was followed by a "Notice," dated June, 1847, in which he apologized: "We had not the time to put any extra gloss upon the Printing, and contented ourselves with letting it pass as a plain piece of work" ( Hand-Book , l. 2). His dignity did not permit him to say that illness had forced him to be in New York in January, February, and March, thereby preventing him from guiding the book through the press. The imposing array of typographical materials in this volume is all the more impressive when one remembers that Dickinson had been a typefounder for only seven years. The complications of his illness kept him away from his business for such long periods that he could not collect many of his accounts receivable. In March, 1847, the firm had to borrow money to meet the payroll (C. C. P. Moody to Geer, 25 March 1847). He soon sold the printing office, but managed to hold on to the typefoundry for another ten months. Then, as he told Geer, he surrendered to his fate: It may be news to you to learn that I have had to sell out all my business. My health is so bad that I can attend to nothing like an active business. My sale was a forced one, of course, not yielding me more than 30&amp;c.nt; on the dollar of its value. It was ruinous indeed, but I could not do otherwise. Hired men would have eaten up the whole concern in less than 3 years. 45 The formal announcement gave no hint of the personal tragedy: This establishment has been purchased by the subscribers, (partners under the firm of PHELPS &amp; DALTON,) who will be happy to furnish its present friends, and all others, at low prices, with whatever materials may be wanted for a printing office, small or large. Mr. S. N. Dickinson, the enterprising originator and late proprietor of the Foundry, has for several years past been enriching it with materials for many of the most beautiful varieties of Type that could be obtained. Among these, his Real Scotch Faces have been received with general commendation, and they are daily becoming more and more popular for their elegance of form and remarkable durability. Having been regularly brought up to the practice of Printing and Type-Founding, and having long had charge of the two principal branches of business at the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry, the undersigned flatter themselves that they shall be able to produce their manufactures in a style that will give satisfaction to their customers. SEWELL PHELPS. MICHAEL DALTON. [fist] The friends and patrons of this Foundry may rest assured that it has fallen into good and competent hands. Mr. Phelps is well known as an accomplished printer.—Mr. Dalton has had twenty years experience in the practical departments of type-founding, and his knowledge of the art is second to that of no other founder in the country. In relinquishing my favorite business, it affords me pleasure to say that, under the new arrangement, the friends and customers of this Foundry may with certainty depend upon a prompt and faithful discharge of all orders; and that if, heretofore, they have been pleased with its productions, the skill and talents of its present proprietors cannot fail, hereafter, to give them the fullest satisfaction. S. N. DICKINSON. 46 Dalton and Dickinson had known each other since their youthful days at the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry. 47 In the year of the sale of the typefoundry, Dickinson's daughter married Dalton's son. 48 Phelps had been a printer in Boston before becoming associated with the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry. 49 After the purchase, Phelps &amp; Dalton sold the stereotype department and organized a successful business ( Daily Evening Traveller , 12 Aug. 1848; Daily Evening Transcript , 9 Oct. 1848). Retaining the name of Dickinson Type Foundry, Phelps &amp; Dalton, later Phelps, Dalton &amp; Co., continued as a firm until it joined its competitors to organize the American Type Founders Company in 1892. 50</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Publisher Interspersed among the items printed by Dickinson are those which he published as well as printed and those which he compiled, printed, and published. The former group ranges in subject from Rev. Francis Parkman's An Offering of Sympathy (1830) to the first edition of The Pirates Own Book (1837), afterwards frequently republished by others. The latter group includes four projects which deserve greater attention. Dickinson opened his printing office at a time when Americans increasingly favored the expansion of public improvements. Canals, railroads, and steamboats, all recently developed, promised a radical transformation of the economic order which seemed limitless. Only one successful American channel for communication about this euphoric subject existed. At Philadelphia, the American Mechanics' Magazine , later the Journal of the Franklin Institute , began publication in 1825. Undoubtedly Dickinson realized that if a similar magazine on industrial research and development were established in Boston, it would enhance the reputation of his role as printer-publisher. At first he thought of republishing the London Mechanics' Magazine , but decided against it because of "the amount of matter in that periodical of a purely local character, and the speculations therein contained, which are so constantly anticipated by the ingenuity, talent and enterprize of our own countrymen." 51 Instead, within a few months after opening his printing office, he published the first number of the Mechanicks Magazine, and Journal of Publick Internal Improvement on 1 February 1830. The Mechanicks Magazine was addressed "to the man of science, to the man of practical knowledge, and to all who are disposed to advance the Useful Arts, and the cause of Publick Internal Improvement" and articles of "a political, religious, or other publick controversy" would be rigorously excluded ( Mec. Mag. , p. 1). By printing relevant domestic contributions and by reprinting articles from foreign journals, Dickinson hoped to "spread a table upon which genius may lay her crude productions, and where timidity may venture to disclose her worth" ( Mec. Mag. , p. 1). He hoped, too, that the "pages may one day be used as a book of reference, whereby may be exhibited, on comparison with the then existing publications, the various advances in the Useful Arts, and the Improvements made in our country" ( Mec. Mag. , p. 1). Each monthly issue of thirty-two pages, royal octavo, was on paper selected with regard "to the permanency of the work" and "the typographical execution shall be a specimen of the perfection to which the art (in which the Publisher feels it his pride to have been educated) has attained" ( Mec. Mag. , p. 2). During the year, this well-produced journal contained more than four hundred and forty articles of various lengths. In addition to the expected articles on railroads, canals, and steamboats, others were concerned with cloth, clocks, chemistry, physics, patents, and anything else that one could expect to find in a scientific journal of the time. At the end of the year, the publisher provided a comprehensive table of contents and a title page on which the title appeared as The Mechanics' Magazine, and Journal of Public Internal Improvement —omitting the k in "Mechanic" and "Public" in respect, no doubt, to the modernization of spelling. When the first volume was completed, Dickinson advertised that publication was suspended until April when it would be resumed if sufficient encouragement was obtained ( Daily Advertiser , 25 Feb. 1831). The encouragement must have been inadequate because no succeeding volume has been located. If the climate had been less parochial, the magazine might have found more readers, and would now be the "book of reference" Dickinson anticipated. Four years later, Dickinson had greater success with a reference book by compiling, printing, and publishing A Help to Printers and Publishers . As previously mentioned, printers for many years found it indispensable. The tables it contained were as useful to printers as interest tables to bankers. To save time in estimating jobs, Dickinson had calculated the quantity of paper required for a given number of signatures and provided the number of tokens in the amount. A printer could refer to the tables and immediately find the amount of paper and tokens required for a given number of copies and a given number of signatures. For instance, 1,000 copies of a book of 35 signatures would require 735 quires which were 70 tokens. Or 100,000 copies of a four-signature almanac would require 8,400 quires which were 800 tokens. For small quantities, the number of quires and sheets were given. All of the calculations were based on half-sheet work, "this being the most common manner of doing press work." 52 For sheet work, the number of signatures would be doubled when using the tables. With this book of more than two hundred tables at hand, printers could rapidly estimate book, newspaper, and job work. Dickinson received much praise and appreciation for publishing these calculations. At the first exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, he was awarded a diploma for this "original work of immense labor, well executed, and of great convenience and importance to the trade, for which the author is entitled to high commendation." 53 Dickinson's reservoir of energy was still unexhausted. Within a year after finishing work on A Help to Printers and Publishers , he embarked on a publishing project which continued long beyond his own life. He started modestly by compiling, printing and publishing a Boston almanac for 1836. Its eighty-four pages began with a one-sentence preface: "If it be found that the present number of the Boston Almanac suit the public taste, it will be published yearly, about the 10th of the first month." 54 In the preface to the 1837 edition, he expressed satisfaction with the response and remarked about the principles of inclusion: "The reception of the first number of the Boston Almanac in town and country has encouraged the publisher to persevere. In the present number he has not striven to give a great variety of matter, but rather to present what is of greatest local importance." 55 Directed at a specific readership, Dickinson's almanac, as the years passed, was considered "the favorite year-book of Boston" ( Daily Chronotype , 19 Dec. 1848). For improved distribution, the 1837 and succeeding issues were published in December rather than January (1837 Boston Almanac , p. 71). Success soon became burdensome. The work of compilation and printing demanded much of the time of a busy man and problems of distribution were less to his taste. Beginning with the 1839 issue, other firms published it, but Dickinson prepared the text and printed it: The present is the fourth number of the Boston Almanac. Its favorable reception thus far, has been beyond the expectations of the Compiler. The generous patronage it has received, will stimulate him to further and renewed exertions, to make it still more worthy of the public. The labor and care of keeping a thermometrical account of the weather, twice a day, collecting and arranging other matter to make the work complete, is very great, and were our efforts met with other than an approving public, we should have sunk under the task. But, as it is, our course is onward, and each year we hope to add a large amount of interest to our little annual. 56 Scattered among the advertising pages of these almanacs was much information about Dickinson's business activities (a picture of his printing office, announcements of new equipment, specimens of type) and, on one occasion, he used text space for a description of his printing office. 57 Examples of his fancy trade cards were pasted on the end-papers. The printing order for the 1849 Boston Almanac was 40,000 copies. 58 Dickinson's affection for the annual was so intense that he did not cease work while he was dying. He still, as he said in the 1849 preface, tried to improve it: The "rounds of another year" have brought us to another Preface for our little Annual, and it has brought us much nearer to that period when time will have no further reckonings to make with us. Let our probation here be long or short, we shall endeavour to improve the time as best we may for the benefit and pleasure of our numerous readers. The dispensations of Providence toward us have been such, that we have been compelled to abandon all our actual every day business. But our strength and energies have been sufficient to enable us to prepare our Almanac for the press, with more than usual care and attention. Having our mind diverted from other engrossing pursuits, we have brought it to bear more fully upon the immediate subject before us. It will give us pleasure to learn that we have this time made an acceptable Book. 59 This was the last almanac he compiled. According to the Daily Chronotype , "He indeed took special pains with the last number, and had just finished it, with all his accustomed accuracy, when he died" ( Daily Chronotype , 19 Dec. 1848). His creation survived him; the Boston Almanac was published until 1894 and then continued under other titles until 1926. Information about one of Dickinson's most interesting publications is only available in contemporary newspaper accounts—a circumstance which is especially regrettable because the Typographic Advertiser was the first typographical periodical in the United States. In the first number, November, 1845, Dickinson stated the objective: "the general diffusion among printers of such specimens of type and material pertaining to the printing business, as we now manufacture and have for sale, and of such as may hereafter be perfected, as we advance in our business of type founding." 60 The periodical was "a beautifully printed sheet," on which "different varieties of type are so displayed . . . as to afford a correct specimen of their style" ( Daily Evening Traveller , 18 Nov. 1845). The second number, c. June, 1846, principally devoted to newspaper type, received similar praise: "the specimens exhibited are beautiful in the extreme" ( Boston Daily Atlas , 11 June 1846). The third number, c. August, 1846, showed "what a well directed genius can accomplish" ( Boston Recorder , 13 June 1846). Little else is known about the Typographic Advertiser . Perhaps, in some attic or library stack, a file will eventually be found. * * * * * Joseph T. Buckingham summed up his wonderment at Dickinson: "Mr. Dickinson acquired an extended reputation by a perseverance and devotion to his calling, almost unparalleled, and which brought on consumption and premature death." 61 The Daily Evening Traveller 's obituary praised Dickinson as "one of the most enterprising and efficient conductors and improvers of the art of printing" and referred to his "indomitable energy, industry and perseverance" (18 Dec. 1848). The Daily Chronotype said that he "gave himself no respite, not from a passion for amassing, but from his conscientious impulse to do everything well" (19 Dec. 1848). Constant pursuit of excellence drained him physically and financially. At death, the man who had once employed a hundred hands left an estate of $975.68. 62</field>

The printing is very good; as good, probably, as can be done on such a type; but is not equal to the English Annuals. American printing ought now to equal the English; and if our publishers will give their printers the selection of materials, there is no reason why it should not" (p. 118). 25 The Fourth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association (1844), p. 137. 26 Francis N.

      <field name="heading_text">Greg's "Rationale of Copy-Text" Revisited by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps the most influential textual document of this century has been Sir Walter Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," dating from 1949. 1 The general acceptance of this rationale by Anglo-American editors 2 has led to a new school of editing, especially of works in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries under conditions remote from the period 1550-1650 to which he confined himself. The "Rationale" is a theoretical discourse dissociated from any overall survey of typical problems in the editing of a group of authors, or even of any single writer, although it is clear that the Elizabethan drama and its peculiar problems bulked large in Greg's own experience and helped to shape his thinking. The illustrations, drawn from Shakespeare, Jonson, and Marlowe, are more of the nature of case-histories involving the operation of editorial judgment in a few selected verbal cruxes than a systematic attempt to link example with precept to illuminate the workings of the rationale in broader terms. Some of its tone and structure may be laid to the fact that Greg seems to have thought of it largely as a coda to and correction of one element in a much larger work, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942; 2nd ed. 1951); moreover, it was written in the form of a paper to be read at a learned meeting and was published verbatim, with the addition of relatively few footnotes. Finally, although Greg's experience related to the general period 1550-1650 in which he set his argument, actually he confined his examples, with one exception, to plays written within a decade of 1600. He made no specific claims for application beyond the period of his illustrations; and indeed he was not equipped by experience to apply his rationale at first hand to the much more varied conditions of the literary periods that followed. In some part, also, it must be acknowledged, Greg had a wide critic's view of Elizabethan editing and problems of textual transmission (in his day confined almost exclusively to the drama) but a narrower practical experience in critical editing. His two-text edition of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus is a diplomatic reprint, not a critical edition; and his critical text of the play is a modernized one. Thus his actual experience in the nuts and bolts of the editorial process in the period, outside of the Faustus and a vast experience with the Malone Society typographical facsimiles, was confined to his edition of the manuscript texts of Jonson's masque The Gipsies Metamorphosed . However, one must not ignore a very important influence on his experience, that of dealing with the textual problems of the manuscripts in the medieval miracle play cycles (1914) and the theoretical Calculus of Variants (1925) that in some part may have grown from this experience. Greg emphasized, with his usual generosity, that in the first of its two parts—the actual choice of copy-text—the rationale was chiefly a restatement of McKerrow's position in Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939), and that his own original contribution was confined to the second part—the eclectic treatment of 'substantives' and 'accidentals' with their separate authority in collateral-text or in revised-edition situations. The importance of this second part as supplementing the first can hardly be overestimated, however, for it was the capstone of the total theory and (except for Housman in other circumstances) the most convincing expression written of the principle of eclectic texts. Combined with the reasoned emphasis he placed on the choice of copy-text for the authority of its accidentals instead of its substantives, it is this freeing of an editor from 'the tyranny of the copy-text' in his choice of substantives when more than one authority is present that has exercised ultimately the paramount influence. Indeed, it may be said that Greg seems to be more concerned with this matter of editorial freedom of judgment than he is with the narrower matter of copy-text choice, which he seems to have regarded as so well established as to require relatively less illustration and argumentation. On the contrary, in modern editing the choice of copy-text has bulked as large as questions of its treatment. In one or other respect, however, Greg's influence has been so marked that in the words of one scholar, "[Greg's] views have never been publicly refuted." 3 In my opinion these views are indeed irrefutable but only when applied to the specific conditions in which Greg placed them and subjected to the implicit limitations of these rather special conditions. Yet unquestionably they have in theory a wider and equally legitimate scope. Greg himself visualized only a Renaissance textual situation; nevertheless, it is agreed that most of his conclusions are as pertinent to texts of any later period as they are to the age of Shakespeare or Jonson whenever the transmissional conditions are the same. 4 Consequently, for many texts it has been possible to edit Dryden, Fielding, Hawthorne and a number of nineteenth-century authors according to the same rationale as Shakespeare. This fact is now commonly accepted, but the very success of the new editorial theory has brought dangers in its train. 5 In the hands of scholars knowledgeable in the conditions of the nineteenth century but with no personal acquaintance with the Elizabethan textual situations that are familiar to Renaissance students, the rationale has had a tendency to harden into a mold without consideration of the inherent flexibility Greg took for granted within the framework to which he was accustomed. Moreover, the extrapolation of certain of Greg's statements to conditions other than those he envisaged has had a tendency to be dogmatic in a manner alien to Greg's generally permissive attitude for the treatment of exceptional situations. It is no secret that converts are likely to be more rigid than those born to the faith. Attempts to explain the purposes of Greg's rationale and its application—as well as some unusual circumstances in which it does not operate—have appeared from time to time since 1949, 6 but it may still be worth while to attempt a more precise analysis than has been available of the Renaissance textual conditions with which Greg was familiar, the intent being to offer background discussion to assist scholars of other periods when they apply Greg's tenets to later literature and different situations. In this process some analysis may be useful of a few ambiguities and half-lights in Greg's own presentation that could interfere with an understanding of his basic thought. Finally, a brief survey may be introduced of a few of the more common present-day textual problems that offer difficulty. By these means perhaps a more balanced view may be obtained to guide future discussions pro and con. The fairest presentation of Greg's theoretical position, together with a searching analysis of the development and linking of its several lines of argument, is that recently made by Dr. G. Thomas Tanselle (see, above, footnote 4), an essay that removes any necessity for me to repeat the chief items of the rationale. We can, then, begin in medias res . As good a point as any for an opening of the matter comes in Greg's discussion of the reasons why 'accidentals' have a separate authority in a text, sometimes independent of the 'substantives,' and the consequences that follow in the necessity to choose as copy-text that early document containing the most authoritative accidentals without major regard for the status of its substantives. Throughout Greg's discussion he never mentions the relative authority of a holograph manuscript as against that either of a scribal manuscript or of the printed book that ultimately derived from the holograph with or without the author's supervision. Since Elizabethan authorial manuscripts of works that saw print can be counted just about on the fingers of one hand, it seems evident that Greg saw no point in considering a contingency that was unlikely to arise, particularly when a simple extension of his principles backward in the transmission would easily cover the case. Thus Greg consistently writes in terms of the preservation of accidental authority only in derived documents which by their very nature must imperfectly reproduce the author's own system of spelling, punctuation, word-division, etc., if system there was. These particular conditions help to explain certain of his attitudes. First, the overlay of the author's accidentals by the transmissional process is more extreme in the Renaissance than in later periods, thus diminishing the authority in this respect of any derived document. Since in its spelling, standards of capitalization, division, and in the somewhat impressionistic rhetorical instead of syntactical system of punctuation 7 the language was in a state of flux, the widest variety of accidentals prevailed within a general framework of acceptability. Johnson's Dictionary imposing standards of spelling was still well in the future. The manuscripts of the period, except for careful scribal copies for presentation, may have practically no fixed standards at all, and can be especially deficient in punctuation, some almost to the point of unintelligibility. Even the prompt-books for plays are often so erratically punctuated as to leave almost complete freedom to any compositor if he had set copy from them, let alone the actor who recited from the parts transcribed from these books. For many words neither authors nor compositors had any fixed system of spelling but only a general preference for one form or another, if that. (Shakespeare—if it was he who wrote Hand D in the Sir Thomas More manuscript—in a brief scene spells sheriff in five different ways.) The accidental characteristics of compositors were likely to be more advanced than those of authors; it follows that each resetting of type, whether in transferring a manuscript to print or in reprinting the text of an earlier edition, was a modernization. 8 Systematic proof-correction by authors was a rarity. Among themselves compositors differed in their spelling preferences so that a book might exhibit several different sets of characteristics. Whatever effort a compositor or scribe might make to reproduce the wording of his copy, no suggestion is present in the period that any importance was attached to following the author's ordinary run of accidentals. Under these conditions Greg knew that (in a manner impossible in the nineteenth century) 9 the accidents of a printed book would differ considerably from those of the holograph, in contrast to the substantives that a compositor might be supposed to wish to reproduce with reasonable fidelity. This fact is at the root of his division between the authority of substantives and of accidentals. The prospects that any printed book (or scribal manuscript) would reflect to any significant degree the author's accidentals are uncertain and variable, in most cases difficult to recover, and if fortuitously recovered difficult to identify. 10 Hence Greg makes no claims for specific recognizable authority in the copy-text accidentals and regards their reproduction as more significant of the time (and locality of a scribal transcript) than of the author, at least in any identifiable form. His discussion (p. 376) of the possibilities in the distant future of establishing a "standard spelling for a particular period or district or author" is in part a red herring, applying more to manuscript than to printed-book texts, and it represents chiefly a cautious attempt to protect his flanks (that it is necessary, instead, "to choose whatever extant text may be supposed to represent most nearly what the author wrote and to follow it with the least possible alteration") from the experiments for synthetic accidentals that were starting in his day among editors of medieval texts. It can be ignored with safety. Why he limited his succeeding statement to manuscripts and did not include printed books in writing "Thus a contemporary manuscript will at least preserve the spelling of the period, and may even retain some of the author's own" is hard to understand except for the speculation that Greg himself felt somewhat more secure about the facts of manuscript transmission (which he had studied) than about the specific details of compositorial transmission with which he had only a general acquaintance. (The considerable scholarship devoted to the spelling characteristics of Elizabethan compositors, principally in the First Folio, has developed mostly since Greg's day.) At any rate, it is possible to clarify for the modern scholar Greg's conclusion that "it is only on the grounds of expediency, and in consequence either of philological ignorance or of linguistic circumstances, that we select a particular original as our copy-text." This applies almost exclusively to multiple manuscript texts of the same work and in essence is of no concern whatever to a nineteenth-century editor. In fact, Greg introduces this statement mainly as an argumentative ploy to support the conclusion that the editorial treatment of scribal manuscript accidentals must be conservative, through ignorance, whereas that of substantives can be subject to editorial judgment. It has little or nothing to do with the selection of copy-text for works preserved in print. If one is not to modernize an early text (and Greg rejects this proposition for scholarly editions), then the accidentals of some one document must be chosen as a framework for the substantives. Since in such manuscripts as he has in mind we are dealing not with holographs but with documents that may derive from holograph at some distance and will preserve the author's accidentals only in part (if at all) and in details unknown to us, we should select that (manuscript) document as copy-text which best preserves the accidentals of the author's period and district (when possible). It is granted that because of the derived state of the manuscripts we do not possess the philological expertise to restore the exact accidentals of the original period of its holograph. Thus we bow to expediency in selecting the manuscript that seems best to reflect the original conditions, including the linguistic circumstances of district. However the choice of manuscript copy-text is decided, it is based on expediency, in the sense that whatever selection is made from among various documents will at best be a compromise that only imperfectly (if at all) can be supposed to reproduce the holograph's exact characteristics; nevertheless, once chosen, this document's accidentals are to be transcribed and retained with a minimum of alteration except as correction is needed. What to Greg is the more important point in this discussion then follows: although the transmission of documents may vitally affect their accidentals, it affects the substantives in ways that textual and critical analysis can evaluate, whereas little can be done on the evidence to utilize such critical techniques to recover authoritative accidentals. Accordingly, by the full exercise of editorial judgment these original substantives can be reconstructed on the whole (according to the limits of the evidence) in a manner impossible for the accidentals. Greg thus emerges from his consideration of early manuscripts to the more pertinent examination of the conditions in which book copy-texts should be selected. In doing so, he comes for the first time to examples that may apply to later literatures. The grounds of expediency in the choice of manuscript copy-text with which he introduced his discussion of accidentals have only occasional application to early printed books 11 and none to those of the nineteenth century. The reason is that in his analysis of the situation in respect to manuscripts Greg automatically assumed the presence of a number of collateral texts for the work, this multiplicity of documents not ordinarily resulting from the progress of the work through different stages of authorial revision but instead from the copying on different occasions of a variety of texts deriving from the lost archetype. Except for a few special cases in the hand-printing era, these conditions scarcely exist in later times independent of revision, which was not primarily in question in the manuscripts Greg was hypothesizing. 12 Note: A collateral manuscript, in the purest sense, is one in a different independent branch of the family tree from another. That is, it does not derive in direct line from any other known or hypothesized example of the manuscript text to which it is collateral. Direct line means what it says: thus two manuscripts that derive from any two branches created by radiation from the archetype are not in linear relationship to each other. The assumption is ordinarily made that the variant texts of two collateral manuscripts are in the same state; that is, one is not authorially revised and the other untouched although that proviso is not necessarily a part of the definition of 'collateral' so long as the central situation of non-linear derivation is observed. Greg (p. 377) defines a collateral relationship as one in which each manuscript is "derived from the original independently, or more or less independently, of the others." Although his qualification "more or less independently" takes care of contamination, or the insertion of readings in one line by reference to another, the definition leaves unanswered the central question whether "derived from the original independently" requires a collateral manuscript to be in one or another of the two or more lines that usually, as reconstructed, diverge from the archetype, or original, in most family trees, or else in similar divergence but within a single one of these branches. Despite his language, it may seem that he meant the latter, which is a still acceptable but less strict usage. For example, an earlier form of a manuscript can be conjecturally recovered from two documents that have forked within one of the major textual lines, but not from two manuscripts which in a direct line derive one from the other. The latter can scarcely be called collateral, whereas the conjectured antecedent document at the fork can be recovered from two 'collateral' manuscripts in the general sense, since it is a form of archetype for the two manuscripts concerned and indeed would be the archetype itself were there only one line conjectured from the holograph. Presumably this antecedent document is what Greg thought of when he wrote 'original' even though properly speaking a similar antecedent document if there were a second main line from the archetype might be recovered from 'collateral' manuscripts and then these two truly collateral recovered hypothetical documents might be compared with each other to reconstruct the only true original, the archetype X from which stem the two main divergent lines. A practical case involving printed editions comes in Stephen Crane's "Death and the Child." One typescript made from his manuscript, ribbon and carbon, was the copy for the English magazine and book publication; a second typescript, ribbon and carbon, made independently from the same manuscript served for the American magazine and book publication. The major features of each typescript can be recovered by comparison of magazine and book, this representing the conjectured document at the fork. Then the two recovered typescripts can be compared to recover the major features of X, the manuscript. In the general sense each country's magazine and book text are collateral since an antecedent document can be recovered from the two; however, the strict collateral sense could be applied only to the documents that represented the different typescripts, like the English magazine and the American book texts, etc. When a book text is never revised or in any way altered by comparison with some other authorially-derived document, only one authoritative document can be identified. Since he ignores holographs, Greg places this single authority as the earliest printed text, the one that derives most immediately from the author's lost manuscript and is thus distinguished from any later series of mere reprints 13 stemming in linear fashion from the one primary authoritative preserved document. This is a 'substantive edition': in the case outlined it is the only substantive edition, and obviously it represents the sole possible authority both for accidentals and for substantives (the wording). It is the only form of copy-text that presents to an editor no problems other than correction. Greg's use of the term substantive edition is in some part misleading. In note 1 on p. 378 he accepts McKerrow's definition as "an edition that is not a reprint of any other" and states "I shall use the term in this sense, since I do not think that there should be any danger of confusion between 'substantive edition' and 'substantive readings'." On p. 379 the next statement is clear: "Whatever may be the relation of a particular substantive edition to the author's manuscript (provided that there is any transcriptional link at all) 14 it stands to reason that the relation of a reprint of that edition must be more remote." This is an extension of the original reference on p. 378, "in the rare cases in which a later edition had been revised by the author or in which there existed more than one 'substantive' edition of comparable authority." The distinction drawn here between two kinds of editions needs explanation in terms of the examples Greg had in mind if it is to have any application to later periods. In the first case an author would annotate a copy of an early edition with his corrections and revisions and send the marked-up copy to the printer. Greg calls this situation a rare one: it is rare in the years close to 1600 simply because of a paucity of authorially revised editions, and the only examples that he mentions are Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller and the Jonson Folio set from marked copies of the quartos 15 and at least in part seen through the press by the author. Technically the Jonson is not a substantive edition according to McKerrow because, in Greg's phrase, it is a revised reprint of the quarto copy. What Greg had in mind for the second category of two substantive editions of comparable authority is almost completely an Elizabethan phenomenon when applied to two printed editions and not to a printed edition and one or more collateral manuscripts. For the moment to pass over the matter of bad-quarto texts, including for the sake of argument King Lear , Greg's second category consists of the Quarto and Folio editions of Hamlet, Othello, Troilus and Cressida , and 2 Henry IV . In their desire to print the Folio from what they considered to be the best texts, and perhaps in one case because of copyright problems, the Folio editors did not merely reprint these plays from the available good quarto texts without annotation of their own as in Romeo and Juliet or with minor alteration deriving from the prompt-book as in The Merchant of Venice, Richard II , or I Henry IV . Instead, the Folio version of the text derives its substantives in major part from the authority of a manuscript in a different tradition from that which was the setting copy for the Quarto. However, this manuscript was not itself set by the Folio printer but for convenience he was given a copy of the Quarto that had been annotated to bring the original printed version into general conformity with the variant readings of the manuscript. Technically, therefore, this expedient by the Folio editors disqualified the Folio texts of these plays for consideration as 'substantive editions' under McKerrow's definition since the Folio is in considerable part a reprint of the Quarto except for the marked alterations. On the other hand, if one thinks exclusively of the literary status of the Folio text, fresh authority has certainly entered and both Quarto and Folio could be regarded critically (not bibliographically) as 'substantive editions' even though one text was not revised from another by the authorial post-publication process that produced, say, the revised reprint of the Folio Sejanus from Jonson's Quarto. Instead, the divergences in the versions appear to stem from pre-publication differences between the two manuscripts behind the separate editions, which varied from each other in the state of their texts. Since the manuscripts were either written by Shakespeare or else were scribal copies of a holograph even at some remove—and in at least some of the plays appear to represent different stages in the development or perhaps in the theatrical application of the text—each is therefore 'authoritative' and the printed results represent (again only in a literary and not in a technical sense) two substantive editions of comparable authority. The phrase comparable authority has little relation in Greg's mind to the critical question of the literary merit of the texts. Instead, authority is a technical term in textual criticism signifying the derivation of any form from the author, preferably by some transcriptional link. Authority may be inferior as when some major contamination in the transmission has affected the validity of one text, or when the distant relation of an edition to the holograph suggests the possibility of more than usual transmissional corruption; or it can be very strong, as when a printed edition is set directly from holograph. Hence Greg uses comparable authority to indicate that, so far as the evidence goes, in the main the author had a relatively equal concern in the composition of both versions and that each is close enough to the author so as not to have been distorted excessively by transmissional problems. Authorial concern need not have been revisory, although revision is not by definition excluded. 16 This is what he had in mind when on p. 381 he wrote: "McKerrow was, therefore, in his later work quite conscious of the distinction between substantive readings and accidentals, in so far as the problem of revision is concerned. But he never applied the conception to cases in which we have more than one substantive text, as in Hamlet and perhaps in 2 Henry IV, Troilus and Cressida , and Othello ." Greg uses the term substantive edition , or its equivalent, again on pages 384-385, "But whenever there is more than one substantive text of comparable authority [footnote excluding 'bad quartos'], then although it will still be necessary to choose one of them as copy-text, and to follow it in accidentals, this copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings are concerned." Finally, on page 391, "Of both [ Richard III and King Lear ] much the best text is supplied by the folio of 1623; but this is not a substantive text, but one set from a copy of an earlier quarto that had been extensively corrected by collation with a manuscript preserved in the playhouse." A basic confusion is created by the use in these juxtaposed passages of the term substantive edition (or text ) in two contradictory senses. In his statement on Richard III and King Lear he is employing the strict McKerrow definition that he had promised to observe. This holds for his statement about Hamlet , which Greg regarded as set in Q and in F from two independent manuscripts, a view no longer popular. On the other hand, in his remarks about 2 Henry IV, Troilus , and Othello he forgets that he is supposed to be observing McKerrow and instead reverts to an important modification of the term that he had made in the Editorial Problem whereby what he called 'mixed texts' joined McKerrow's editions (not derived from any other) as a separate category of an expanded concept of what constitutes substantive texts . Editions were mixed if one had been used as basic setting copy for a later but in the process had (a) been conflated by some agent with a more or less authoritative manuscript in a different tradition from that used as setting copy for the earlier, or (b) been revised by the author making his own annotations as Jonson had done in preparing copy for the 1616 Folio by marking up his quarto plays. Independently transmitted texts were automatically substantive in the McKerrow manner. Mixed texts that had undergone scrupulous authorial supervision (preferably of the printing as well as the preparation of copy), like Jonson's, were also admitted without other qualification as substantive. However, for mixed texts resulting in the Shakespeare Folio from conflation of the quarto with some other manuscript, Greg believed that the criterion of an alteration in their 'essential character' had to be applied before the Folio could be allowed as a substantive edition. An example of this reasoning comes in footnote 1 on page xix of The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare : Note: The folio text of Hamlet is certainly, and that of Othello almost certainly, substantive in its own right [i.e. set from independent manuscripts]: neither, therefore, comes in question here. In Troilus it is probable, and in 2 Henry IV possible, that the folio text was printed from a copy of a quarto that had been altered by comparison with a manuscript and therefore partakes at least to some extent of the character of a mixed text, but it is by no means clear that the alteration was such as to raise the folio to substantive rank, still less that the folio should be regarded as the more authoritative. In mid-1949 when the "Rationale" was written it is uncertain whether Greg had been informed privately by Dr. Alice Walker of her researches indicating that F Othello had been set from an annotated copy of Q, although his association of Othello on page 381 not with Hamlet but with the two plays he was convinced were mixed by conflation would seem to suggest the possibility, or at the least his concern that other discussions to the same effect of Othello had made its mixed more probable than its independent nature. But at least in respect to Troilus and to 2 Henry IV there can be no question that the Folio could not conform to McKerrow's definition of a substantive edition. Hence the passage in the "Rationale" specifying the four plays as substantive represents a lapse in favor of his earlier (1942) inclusion of mixed editions and contradicts his express statement that he will use substantive edition only in McKerrow's sense of 'completely independent.' Thus what Greg is actually saying on page 381 is this: Hamlet is substantive in both editions because each was set directly from manuscript; on the other hand, the three other plays, being mixed texts, come under another criterion for substantiveness—that of a change in F from the essential character of the text in Q—and he is uncertain whether in fact Q and F have been sufficiently modified in their essential character to warrant substantive status. 17 In this paragraph, then, he is definitely not following his definition of substantive as on page 391, 18 and the reader needs a warning to the effect. Moreover, the straying here brings in question what he intended in the other references to substantive texts or editions (there can be no distinction in kind although one is possible in form), for if these four plays (including Hamlet as we now believe) are not substantive in the Folio because set from marked-up quartos, then Greg is left with no illustration of what he had in mind (in the McKerrow sense) in writing of such dual substantive texts. This is anomalous, for the exact circumstances that led him to deny substantive status to the Folio Richard III operate for Othello and the rest. It is an article of faith that in this period a scribe bringing printed copy into general conformity with a manuscript in lieu of giving the printer the manuscript as setting copy 19 would confine himself largely to the transfer of variant words and would ordinarily ignore accidentals that were not associated with the variant substantives; hence the accidentals of the Folio, it is believed, are in the main Jaggard's compositors' versions of the Quarto's and of no authority since they would lack any transcriptional link with a manuscript that in turn ultimately derived from Shakespeare. Under these conditions, and editor is forced to choose the Quarto versions as copy-texts, regardless of any other considerations (except for 'bad quartos') because they alone have transcriptional links that ultimately tie them with the holographs. 20 The sole editorial question then concerns the authority of the variant substantive readings taken one by one, in which matter Greg is on relatively solid ground even though he is silent on the intricacies of the textual problems that might influence editorial judgment. Note: The basic question in these plays is (a) whether a variant between Q and F results from Shakespeare's revision, as has been argued for Troilus , or (b) whether one or the other is an error created in the course of the transmission as in Greg's example of Q2 fearful but F fretful porpentine in Hamlet , or (c) whether both are in error, probably because the Q error was not corrected by the scribe annotating copy for F, as seems to be certain in Hamlet's QF good kissing carrion for the standard emendation god kissing carrion , or less certainly Q1's dead vast and middle of the night for Q2-F dead waste , or (d) both readings go back to a common error in their copy, as may be supposed for minute's rest in Q and F The Merry Wives of Windsor which on the analogy of Romeo and Juliet should be minim's rest . As for the matter of the definition of a substantive document ('substantive edition' is too precise when one considers modern conditions of manuscripts and typescripts), McKerrow's precise limitation needs further analysis since it promotes some paradoxes. For instance, he does not hesitate to call a memorially reconstructed bad quarto like Richard III the only substantive edition, and the Folio a derived text, simply because the Folio was set from a copy of Q3 brought into general conformity with a manuscript furnished by the play-house. One may question whether accidentals are more important than the words in defining a substantive edition, however, particularly when in such a case the Q3 accidentals have no shred of authority anyway. It does seem odd to deny substantive status to F Othello or to Troilus on a technicality when it would have been accorded if F had been set direct from the manuscript used to annotate Q and when in either case the wording of F may be taken to represent something very close indeed to that of the manuscript, regardless of the accidentals. There are problems, of course. If an edition is to be rated as substantive according to the variation in its wording deriving from some authoritative source, the difficulty of estimating the degree of difference in order to achieve substantive status may be subject to opinion, as Greg found when wrestling in his Editorial Problem with the question whether F 2 Henry IV was or was not substantive. It would seem that McKerrow's definition needs to be modified but that Greg's more general use is not perhaps entirely satisfactory either. Linear authorial revisions present a further difficulty. Is Jonson's Every Man in his Humour substantive both in Q and in F but Sejanus not? Are not the differences between Q and F Sejanus about as important for the wording as between the technically substantive manuscript and quarto of The Masque of Queens ? Should the status of the accidentals dictate the definition of substantive text? In another place I have attempted to offer a redefinition of substantive that aims at reconciling these problems (see the reference in footnote 17). Since a textual critic is now left with no examples in the "Rationale" of early printed books with variant texts (not authorially revised editions) set independently from different manuscripts, he will need to supply these for himself. Within this period the ones I am familiar with require a choice between the authority of a printed edition and a manuscript version, scribal as in Beaumont and Fletcher's Beggars Bush, Woman's Prize , and Bonduca , or authorial as in George Herbert's Temple ; or else a printed edition and multiple scribal manuscript texts as in the poems of John Donne. An editor can approach the Beaumont and Fletcher plays as if the manuscript were actually a printed edition (or the 1647 Folio a manuscript) since only the two documents are preserved in their different traditions and the choice of copy-text resolves into the usual question of transmissional closeness to holograph versus the problem of the early or late date for the reproduction of the accidentals. 21 When various manuscript texts of different degrees of completeness are preserved of poems, as with Donne, usually no way exists to draw a family tree for each short lyric, although something can be done in rougher outline for some of the collections as a whole. An editor is forced to consider the printed edition merely as the equivalent of the manuscript that was its copy, substantially subject to the same rules of a reconstructed text that characterize editions of manuscripts. In order to secure general uniformity of accidental texture most editors prefer to select the printed edition as copy-text on just such grounds of expediency as Greg remarked, although some circumstances might suggest a bolder course even when considerable disparity between the accidental systems of different poems would result. However, many manuscript versions of poems would be troublesome to read without as much editorial tidying up as the original printer gave his copy; and so unless one is dealing with holograph, editorial expediency is not necessarily blameworthy since authentic results are so very uncertain when working with derived documents. A reader unacquainted with Renaissance textual conditions must also be on guard not to draw improper parallels between modern cases and the implications of Greg's use of Hamlet and the other three plays as examples of dual authority. Greg mentions these in context with a consideration of revised editions and the most suitable treatment for them, and hence one may believe that he considers these plays to greater or lesser degree might perhaps come in that category (but see below). He seems most taken with the Folio Hamlet , although no critic that I recall has squarely faced up to the implications of any theory that the alterations that might seem revisory are Shakespeare's or another's. The best case for revision can perhaps be made for Troilus and the least good for 2 Henry IV . At any rate, whether these plays do indeed represent a special class of authorially revised texts is distinctly moot. Note: The alterations in the Quartos made by scribal comparison with some manuscript preserved in the playhouse give to the substantives of the Folio texts of this group of plays what may properly be called 'authoritative status,' provided that authoritative is not taken as a comparative meaning superior to the 'authority' of the Quartos but only that the variants in both texts have a direct reference back to some authority. To compound the possible confusion, it seems likely that when Greg writes of a 'revised edition' he is not, after all, suggesting that the source of the variants in the Folio lies necessarily with Shakespeare's revisions of a state of the text known through the Quarto. (For instance, this would not agree with his views about the transmission of the Othello text as found in Q and F.) What he seems to have in mind, sometimes, is that the Folio editors from their point of view 'revised' a good Quarto by reference to some manuscript which in their opinion offered a superior text whether because of its more faithful transmission from the archetypal holograph or because it had in the process of transmission been authorially revised. (With their views about the pre-eminent authority of prompt-books, the Folio editors might well, also, have considered that play-house revision improved the text over working papers.) Thus although never specified, a reader may need to translate Greg's use of revised edition some-times but not always to signify merely a text that reproduces an altered version of some authority but with no necessary inference that Shakespeare was himself responsible for both versions by reason of his revisions. Moreover, what Greg did not distinguish were the differences in editorial problems between pre-publication and post-publication authorial revision. Post-publication revision almost automatically requires the hypothesis (usually demonstrable) that an earlier printed copy has been revised by the author. When this occurs, as remarked, no question of copy-text arises for early books because of the assumption that the usual revising author, like Nashe, would pay small attention to changing the accidentals of the printed copy that were acceptable by current standards. After all, he knew that the compositor(s) of the revised edition were going to alter what they set according to their own wishes and that this result would also be acceptable by current standards. In his own period, except for Ben Jonson, Greg could not have conceived of an author—like Walt Whitman or Henry James (or William)—closely supervising the details of revised editions for accidentals as well as substantives. It is odd that in the "Rationale" as distinct from the Editorial Problem Greg is curiously uncertain when he treats Jonson, who of all Elizabethan authors has the best claim to the supervision of most parts of a revised edition, as in his Folio Works in 1616. Greg knows where he stands when it comes to the Folio Every Man in his Humour which, though set from an annotated quarto, was so heavily rewritten as to enforce the choice of the Folio as copy-text, it being a labor of Hercules to work up an apparatus for a text that would endeavor to insert the Folio accidental as well as substantive revisions in the original Quarto texture. What Greg does not mention, and may even not have recognized, was the fact that for choice of copy-text it was not the question whether Jonson's revision of the Folio accidentals in this play made them on the whole more authoritative than those of the Quarto (a proposition that could be readily paralleled in modern times). Instead, he accepts the Folio as copy-text on what turn out to be grounds of expediency: because of the very thorough substantive rewriting, the accidentals that accompany the altered wording must of course be accepted, and these are so numerous as to make it almost impossible to attempt with any consistency to preserve the Quarto accidentals when revision of the substantives would not necessarily have affected their variation. In this particular example there is nothing wrong with expediency (although Greg does not call it that) as a practical matter, but expediency can seldom operate as a principle. Thus when he comes to other of Jonson's revisions his gingerly treatment is likely to mislead a reader who does not know enough about the circumstances to recognize that at bottom Greg is also applying expediency to cases that are not at all parallel and should have been subject to principle. In dealing with the Jonson Folio as a unit, Greg notes that although it has been disputed whether Jonson revised the proofs, Simpson was most likely correct in assuming that he did so; but there can be no question that Jonson was responsible for the numerous corrections made while the sheets were in process of printing. He continues: "Simpson's consequent decision to take the folio for his copy-text for the plays it contains will doubtless be approved by most critics. I at least have no wish to dispute his choice" (pp. 390-391). He then appends to this last sentence the footnote "Simpson's procedure in taking the 1616 folio as copy-text in the case of most of the masques included, although he admits that in their case Jonson cannot be supposed to have supervised the printing, is much more questionable." This position about the Folio is difficult to equate with Greg's principles for the choice of copy-text as illustrated by Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller —that identified substantive revision should be introduced into the accidental texture of the earliest edition. It is this pronouncement about Nashe that has been taken by modern critics as an absolute, without sufficient understanding of the complex reasons (including expediency) that led Greg to take the opposite position for Jonson, and not necessarily just for Every Man in his Humour . In the first place, Greg certainly thought of Jonson's care to supervise the printing of his works as an exception to ordinary Elizabethan authorial procedures. For the Folio Greg mentions three stages of supervision of the revised edition: Jonson's marking of alterations in the copy sent to the printer; Jonson's revision of the Folio proofs; and finally his correction of the sheets while they were in process of printing. The first and third of these are incontrovertible, whereas the second (which could be argued was perhaps the chief reason for Greg's acceptance of Simpson's choice of the Folio) is so conjectural as to be of small value as a basis for editorial principle. A distinction exists between the second and third that is a product of hand printing only. A scrupulous author could indeed require pre-printing proofs, but they were not at all common chiefly because they delayed production of the volume and in some cases even the output in other respects of the printing shop. That is, since type was in short supply and had to be distributed before the next sheet (in general) could be completely typeset, composition of the Folio would have been suspended while Jonson read such special proofs. Under these circumstances printers ordinarily required authors, instead, to attend the press. This term meant that an author would drop by the printing shop each day and would read whatever proof was handy. Sometimes it might be newly-set type-pages if available, but ordinarily the author picked up a sheet being printed, marked any changes he wished, and the press was stopped while the changes were made, to be incorporated in all subsequent sheets printed. Collation of multiple copies, as was done with the Jonson Folio, will reveal the majority of such in-press alterations, which indeed were the usual method of proofreading even by the printer's own reader. Note: For the usual methods of making in-press corrections, see my "Elizabethan Proofing," Essays , pp. 240-253. Simpson's slightly vague language may just possibly have misled Greg into thinking that a claim had been made for substantially more authorial proofreading than the at-the-press correction that Simpson recognized took place. In the textual discourse on the 1616 Folio as a whole, Simpson contents himself ( Works , IX, 51-52) with the statement that "It was the exception, not the rule, for a seventeenth-century printer to send out proofs to an author. The author dropped in at the press once or twice a day, looked over the newly taken pulls, and corrected such errors as caught his eye in a cursory reading." This comes in a discussion of the in-press corrections and by no means implies that Jonson worked differently. Writing of Sejanus ( Works , IV, 339) Simpson states only, "Jonson's proof-reading was probably done at the printing-house from fresh pulls supplied him on the spot" and he continues with a discussion of the number of errors not altered by the press-correction because of these less than ideal conditions. The equation of 'newly taken pulls' and 'fresh pulls' would seem to indicate that Simpson was not describing the special conditions of formal proofs sent to Jonson while printing was suspended but instead the normal attendance of an author at the press which would produce the visible variant states of the printed sheets and not invisible and unknowable preprinting correction. Indeed, on the evidence, this latter pre-printing correction is unlikely, for if Jonson had read proofs at his leisure before impression of any sheet was made, he should have had no occasion to make so many as the six hundred odd changes that mark his press-correction of the Folio. 22 If, then, any suggestion can be dropped that Jonson read proofs other than at the printer while the sheets were being machined, an editor is spared having to take account of quite unassessable evidence and can approach the task of comparing the printed Quarto with the Folio in its uncorrected and corrected formes in a rational endeavor to estimate, as an editor must, how much of the accidental variation was due to Jonson and how much to the printer. The choice of copy-text will depend upon his answer. In the nature of the case we have no means of knowing precisely to what extent Jonson marked the accidentals for change in the original copy for each separate play; but in certain plays like Sejanus Simpson can point with certainty to Jonson's idiosyncratic attempts to impose a classicizing spelling system on Greek and Latin derivatives and to utilize the apostrophus, a metrical punctuation designed to mark the presence of an extra syllable to be lightly sounded in the line (IV, 337-341). He also gives examples, which appear to be buttressed by the evidence of Jonson's holographs as well as his press-corrections, illustrating some of the subtleties of Jonson's punctuation alterations (IV, 342; IX, 73). The important question then arises of the degree, outside of the preserved evidence of the press-corrections, to which Jonson was able to enforce the compositors to follow copy in the details he had presumably marked for alteration as well as in those he had not. The evidence suggests that he had the usual Elizabethan luck, meaning that the compositors despite what may have been good intentions by no means followed copy in anything approaching the manner one would expect in modern times. The evidence is of two kinds: first, the extraordinary amount of press-correction required when printing was in progress (presumably to correct departures from copy in at least some part); and second, the large number of idiosyncratic accidentals lost in the transition from Quarto to Folio even though some were added, not only the classicized spellings but particularly the apostrophus, which Simpson was forced to supply from the Quarto in perhaps half of the total occurrences. Especially when it is considered that in Sejanus specifically, and in general in the other plays also, Jonson did nothing in the press-corrections about the Folio departures from his ordinary spellings (and these were fairly numerous), a problem does indeed arise whether the supervision that he gave the play both in the preparation of the marked Quarto copy and in the Folio press-correction is sufficient to elevate the Folio to copy-text status for plays (unlike Every Man in his Humour ) where the amount of substantive revision was markedly less and so had little or no effect on the separate problem of the accidentals that were independent of revision. In this connection Greg's footnote about the masques is surprisingly mild. It does not seem 'questionable' to accept the 1616 Folio as copy-text for portions that Jonson admittedly did not supervise in the printing: it seems quite contrary to Greg's whole position since for the masques, at least, the line is a thin one between the case of The Unfortunate Traveller except for the hypothesized marking of the masque copy. That is, if the control that Jonson exercised by press-correction is missing (and this should have no bearing on matters of copy-text), Greg's mere questioning of Simpson's choice of copy-text for the masques implies his at least partial acceptance of the proposition that Jonson's marking of his copy was sufficiently detailed to change the texture of the Folio accidentals from derived to 'substantive' status. Such a view needs more evidence than has been advanced: it is basically most improbable. Some hint as to Greg's seemingly paradoxical reasoning may be extracted from a statement he made about Sejanus . Although this play comes in a part of the Folio where Jonson did exercise what control he chose over the printing as well as the copy, Greg allows that "In the case of a work like Sejanus , in which correction or revision has been slight [in comparison with Every Man in his Humour ], it would obviously be possible to take the quarto as the copy-text and introduce into it whatever authoritative alterations the folio may supply." He then adds, "and indeed, were one editing the play independently, this would be the natural course to pursue." The coda indicates that somehow Greg felt it was suitable to choose the Folio as copy-text for Sejanus in an edition within the Works that (rightly or wrongly) had opted for the Folio as the more convenient or even authoritative copy-text document as a whole, even though if one were editing the play independent of its place as a Folio play, the Quarto would be the natural copy-text. Since Sejanus is by no means an exception but rather the rule within the Folio, this seems to me to exemplify either a singularly uncharacteristic waffling in the matter of the Herford-Simpson edition or a complete disregard of his own acute and important distinction between editions of particular authorities and editions of works (p. 384). The Herford-Simpson Jonson was ostensibly an edition of the works which by a mistaken choice of copy-text for many parts turned itself into an edition of the Folio. That Greg gives simultaneous approval to two contradictory positions in respect to the same play confuses the more general application of his principles. And his return, after the discussion of Sejanus , to Every Man in his Humour as a revised edition does not assist matters, since this is admittedly an exceptional case, one in which the Folio's authorial accidentals are dependent upon the amount of substantive revision, whereas in Sejanus , the other plays, and the masques, the substantive revision is insufficient to affect the central copy-text question of how much Jonson was able to impose his wishes (assuming that he had such comprehensive wishes, for which the evidence is partial) upon the accidentals of the Folio text, regardless of the substantives. On page 390, in which the discussion of Jonson is concluded, Greg in effect decides that in cases of revision no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint. This is not very helpful nor is it necessarily true. What is less than satisfactory is that in the end, given the contradictory state of the Jonson discussion, Greg leaves the reader with a generality and no guidelines except for the almost unique case of Every Man in his Humour and the elementary case of The Unfortunate Traveller . The general impression is that he has not himself thought through the situation, with enough concrete examples in mind over a broad enough scope, to afford the reader any material assistance, even in formulating rules of thumb. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that Every Man in his Humour is not a useful example of revision either in its own day or later, 23 and what holds true for it need not hold true for other revised editions in which the rewriting of the substantives has not throughout so vitally affected the forms of the accidentals. Most revised editions have not been subject to such thorough rewriting; hence the editorial problem for them is the extent to which within the areas of unchanged substantives the differences in accidentals in a revised edition may be referred to the author. It is this question, and this question only, to which the choice of original or of revised edition as copy-text must be directed. Note: No one can speak with authority who has not studied the textual transmission of Sejanus in depth and with careful attention to the Jonsonian accidentals of the preserved holographs of other works. I can offer only a theoretical opinion after a cursory run-through of the Simpson apparatus and the Jonsonian manuscripts. The press-correction of Sejanus is insufficient to produce all of the authentic variation between the two editions, and we must assume that Jonson marked the printer's copy in various respects. How minutely this was done is open to question except for certain specific Jonsonian idiosyncrasies, but there is seeming evidence that, in addition to the classicizing spellings and the added examples of apostrophus, plus a general tendency to reduce capitals and to tinker with other typographical conventions that Simpson remarks, a not entirely comprehensive revision of the punctuation was undertaken, how thoroughly is difficult to determine (see footnote 22 above). As in the apostrophus, there are in some respects debits in the Folio general punctuation running contrary to the more characteristic forms in the Quarto, these being indicative of Folio compositorial variation from copy. Thus whether on the whole the Folio punctuation in the uncorrected states of the formes represents Jonson's revising wishes better than the Quarto is probable but not demonstrable without closer study than the matter has received, and even then many cases of variation would no doubt be unassignable. If the spelling is taken as the main determinant (as is customary in Elizabethan editing) and if (subject again to closer study) the normalized Folio spelling forms are on the whole compositorial save for the recognizable idiosyncrasies which present no difficulty, then it would be practicable to take the Quarto as copy-text in order to preserve its generally superior texture of ordinary spelling forms and to treat the idiosyncratic accidentals of the Folio like the substantives by incorporating such as the editor believes were authentic Jonsonian alterations in the printer's copy plus those that he knows are Jonson's by reason of Folio press-correction. This would make for a relatively long emendations list in which the few variant substantives would present no problem. The movement of such an apparatus would be forward in that it would provide a reader with a conspectus of recoverable Jonsonian markings in the Q copy and in the F (and Q) press-correction. If F were chosen as copy-text instead, the list of emendations would comprise a return to such Q spellings as the editor believed, on sufficient evidence, had been unauthoritatively altered by the compositors, plus punctuation in the same category, plus the numerous idiosyncratic accidentals in Q normalized or corrupted in F. The movement would be backward. Instead of reflecting the Jonsonian revision of the text, the apparatus would record the correction of unauthoritative changes made in the printing-house from what is taken to have been the marked Q from which F was set. The specific editorial problems in each would differ. When F is taken as copy-text, the reverse possibility exists, that the editor will allow compositorial variation to remain in the text and not correct it from Q. In the first case, it could be argued that the odds favor the retention of original Q authority even at the expense of some overlooking of F correction, whereas in the second the more frequent retained readings of the F copy-text that were compositorial would be unauthoritative. At least theoretically, then, the skilful treatment of Q as copy-text would reproduce more quantitative authority than the same skill applied to purifying F as copy-text, even though the authority of Q had in turn been modified by fresh authority. (This is to assume of course that on the whole the retained Q readings were not in themselves variants from the lost manuscript copy: whether they were or not so variant would be at best conjectural since in the absence of the manuscript Q constitutes the only basic authority we have.) Some analogy is furnished by my statistical survey of the special evidence for Dryden's revision of the accidentals in the first and second editions of The Indian Emperour , with the conclusion that if the revised edition had been taken as copy-text a far greater number of unauthoritative accidentals would have been accepted than (unidentifiable) revised ones preserved ("Current Theories of Copy-Text," Essays , p. 287). However, the analogy may be more suggestive than exact since it would seem that Dryden's concern for the accidentals in his press-alterations (and presumably in the marking of copy) was less than Jonson's, although careful by ordinary standards of his day. Any question of copy-text cannot ignore the fact that the chosen text must be given general authority for the indifferent accidentals. Critical judgment may succeed relatively well in the choice of variant substantives from an original and its revised edition, but many accidentals—chiefly punctuation—are less subject to critical analysis and certainty. It follows that if Q Sejanus were chosen as copy-text, only certain well-established categories could be identified by consensus as accidental revisions in F, to be adopted as emendations: the F reduction of Q capitals, the additions of a few more examples of apostrophus and of classicized spellings in F come to mind as the simplest transfers on a group basis, to which might be added hyphenations in compounds. But the determination of the numerous other punctuational differences would be subject to the editor's discretion on a less firm judgmental basis than the substantives or the agreed-upon groups of accidentals. Otherwise—and especially in the spelling—the general texture of Q would be retained on the theory that Jonson (on the evidence of press-corrections in F) seldom concerned himself to alter spellings except to conform to his identifiable classicizing intentions. With due regard for the evidence of category and intention in the press-corrections, some attempt might be made to restore from F what could be taken as Jonson's specialized comma or other punctuation. If we concentrate only on the matter of spelling, we can see that if F were the copy-text an editor would have a difficult task correcting the F compositorial departures from Q copy, which would presumably represent readings not marked by Jonson. The corpus of Jonsonian holographs is not large and comprehensive enough to furnish material for many decisions. For example, if one takes the non-classicizing spelling variants between Q and F in the first two acts of Sejanus , the following words in Q agree with holograph forms although they have been altered in F to uncharacteristic spellings: Q favor] F favour; honor] honour; labor] labour; rumor] rumour; fervor] fervour; terror] terrour; fruicts] fruits; remoove] remove; coulor or coulour] colour or collour; disseignes or dissignes] designes; commaund] command; inough] enough; encrease] increase; enlarge] inlarge. (Doubtless there are others; these happen to be the ones I have noted.) This is not much of a bag, of course, if with an F copy-text one were restoring known holograph spellings from Q. On the other hand, in these same two acts appear the following additional variants (excluding classicizing spellings going either way): Q cossen or cosin] F cousin; loose] lose; to] too; grouth] growth; phisitian] physitian; graunt] grant; shal] shall; woes] wooes; here] heere; breath] breathe; whether] whither; mind] minde; blist] blest; where] were; forth] foorth; opportunitie] oportunity; daungers] dangers; approach] approch; of] off; sinewes] sinnewes; duety] dutie; hould] hold; tast] taste; knowe] know; ould] old; chord] cord; togither] together; paralells] paralels; begonne] begun; donne] done; lets] letts; guest] ghest; thether] thither. A more careful search of the holographs might identify some of these and authenticate such forms as graunt , daungers , hould , and ould ; but on the whole they need to be taken on faith, since at best they represent only what the Q compositor set when he worked from holograph. However, the odds would appear to be somewhat more in their favor than the corresponding F spellings, which in their turn represent only what the F compositor set as he worked from Q —assuming that these are not the sort of spellings that Jonson would have marked for alteration. If Q were the copy-text, these spellings of unknown but generally presumptive authority would be retained; if F were the copy-text, it would be a bold editor who would accept many of them from Q as emendations when not confirmed by holographs, and hence the critical text would reproduce what on the whole are more likely than not to be the Folio unauthoritative normalizations. The evidence of this enlarged group of 'normal' spellings, therefore, suggests the acceptance of Q as copy-text if the prime purpose of the copy-text at this period is to preserve the spellings that are closer to authority than in a revised reprint. When even idiosyncratic spellings like Q aequall are corrupted in F to equall , it may be suspected that by and large the variant F spellings of Sejanus derive from the compositor. On the other hand, with Q as copy-text an editor must be prepared not just for the relatively simple task of isolating specific Jonsonian accidental idiosyncrasies in F in order to transfer them to the copy-text but also for the more complex decisions in respect to the variant punctuation. My uninformed guess is that more often than not an editor who carefully studied the Jonsonian press-corrections in the Quartos and in the Folio for a precise view of what Jonson wanted, and then related his findings to the holographs, could make shift to emend Q in these respects from F more accurately and comprehensively than if he attempted to correct the F copy-text from Q. In short, the odds may seem to favor an editor's ability to recognize Jonsonian annotation of Q better than compositorial variation in F. A practical consideration also arises. In some critical editions when an early edition has been chosen as copy-text the accidental variations adopted from a later revised edition are recorded under Emendations but no record is made in the Historical Collection of those not accepted, the ground being that they have been assessed as presumptively unauthoritative and that the weight of a mass of unauthoritative accidental minutiae is too much for the apparatus (and the reader) to bear. On the other hand, if an editor chooses a later edition as copy-text, nevertheless any earlier substantive edition (or even revised reprint) has general authority in its accidentals also, and an editor who does not record the unadopted originals in his historical collation could be open to the charge that he has failed to supply the reader with maximum information about the variants in the substantive text, certainly a matter of major interest. This has been the attitude adopted in the William James edition, which generally selects the later authorially revised editions as copy-texts and records the unadopted accidental as well as substantive variation of early periodical versions and of manuscripts. The theory is that if an original edition is not the copy-text but instead a revised reprint, the apparatus should enable a reader to reconstruct the original manuscript or substantive printed edition without parallel texts. Ideally, of course, a reader might like to have similar information about a revised reprint when an earlier substantive edition is the copy-text, for otherwise he has no means of evaluating the editor's failures to emend. This gap in the provision of full information would signify little in the Renaissance when the proliferation of accidental variants in reprints is certainly compositorial and of no value to record save in some special case like Ben Jonson, and it is perhaps always a matter for editorial judgment even in much later times. If there appears to be a good chance that a revising author did in fact concern himself intimately with altering his accidentals, then a full list is advisable, as in the James edition. This was the judicious attitude of Professor Peter Nidditch in his Clarendon edition of Locke's Of Human Understanding (1975). Because he felt that the fourth edition of 1700 had been scrupulously revised by Locke both in accidentals and in substantives by marking a copy of the similarly revised second edition of 1695, and seeing it through the press, he chose this fourth as copy-text. He then felt it incumbent to record all accidental as well as substantive variants in the first and second editions; but he omitted unique accidental variants in the third, an edition that he felt had no authority. He then faced a problem approaching that of Jonson in the fifth edition of 1706, which Locke had begun to prepare as a revision of the fourth but died before completion. Professor Nidditch makes a compromise here in that he does not adopt in his text any accidental readings unique with the fifth on the ground that he cannot be sure that they were authorial, for Locke did not supervise the printing; on the other hand, he does record these unique accidentals in what corresponds to his historical collation despite their uncertain status. In doing so it is clear that he is often listing what are simple compositorial modernizations of no authority whatever. And since he does not trust their authority sufficiently to adopt any as revisory emendations in his critical text, it may be that it was superfluous to record them even though they have a slightly different status from those of the third edition. (For a discussion of the methodology of this significant old-spelling edition of Locke, see my review in The Library , 31 [1976], 385-395.) This question of the extent and purpose of the apparatus is not to be ignored and merits more attention than the rather casual remarks about what may or may not be emended or recorded that Greg provides (pp. 385-386), for the problem of the apparatus could in some cases have a bearing on the choice of copy-text. At the moment it may be said that an editor of Sejanus would have an extensive emendation list (especially in punctuation and capitalization variants) if he chose Q as copy-text, whereas if he chose F he would have a smaller (although still extensive) list of corrections as emendations but the historical collation would be enlarged over that for a Q copy-text if it should (as it should) contain all rejected Q accidentals: if necessary the Q copy-text historical collation could, in addition to the same number of substantives, contain only the rejected F semi-substantive accidentals if an editor felt confident that not much would be gained by a fuller record of all rejected F accidentals. Some readers might feel that separate layers of early and late accidental texture according to the state of a reconstructed text would be distracting and that a relatively uniform system (given normal compositorial variation) adopted from the Folio would be preferable to any necessarily mixed style. For Jonson, at least, this is unlikely to be a valid criticism nor need it be necessarily so for other authors: it is conditioned by the hankering after editions of particular authorities instead of works, and so does not affect principle. Of course, there are always exceptions. Marlowe's Massacre at Paris is known only in a bad quarto, but eleven verse lines from what is almost certainly an authorial manuscript are preserved, providing the correct text for lines 806-820 in the corrupt printed version. In editing this play I thought it better to retain the corrupt text for these lines, uniform with the state of the rest of the play, and to furnish the good manuscript version in a footnote on the same page, especially since the scene continues after the manuscript ends. One reviewer disapproved of this procedure but I am unrepentant. Just possibly I might have felt differently if the good text had been more extensive or if it had contained a complete scene. These are matters of opinion. Greg's "Rationale" presents some difficulties even in dealing with the texts of his own day. The first has little or no relevance to modern textual problems and can be passed over quickly with only a few words of explanation of Greg's position. On pages 384-385 he remarks that whenever there is more than one substantive text of comparable authority, then although one of them must still be chosen as copy-text, the substantive readings of this chosen edition have no preponderant authority over those of the other substantive text. To this he adds a footnote stating that he inserts the proviso that two substantive texts must be of 'comparable' authority in order to exclude the so-called 'bad quartos' of Shakespeare and other reported texts whose testimony can in general be neglected. 24 He should then have emphasized on page 391 that his examples of Richard III and King Lear are commonly taken to represent 'bad quartos' and hence that 'revision' of these texts in the Folio is on a very different basis from what a modern reader might suppose. As a result, there is no proper analogy between them and examples of post-publication authorial revision as represented by Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller or Jonson's Sejanus , or by the second and third editions of Dryden's Indian Emperour and the fourth edition of Tom Jones . 25 Richard III and almost certainly King Lear , then, should never be cited by modern textual critics as Elizabethan examples of revised texts in the usual sense that an earlier satisfactory state of the work has been worked over by an author in order to incorporate improvements and corrections. Note: Briefly, a 'bad quarto' is a memorial version of a work, a reported text. It is usually taken that most came into existence by the efforts of small companies touring the provinces and wanting to act the latest popular London plays. In some cases, at least, it seems relatively certain that (as with the actor who doubled Marcellus and Voltemand in Hamlet ) a member of the company had participated in a London performance and knew something of the play. Other bad quartos may have been communal reconstructions as has been conjectured for Richard III . However they may have been formed, they represent texts of considerable corruption that can scarcely be taken to reproduce a recognizably authorial version, as may be seen by comparing the preserved fragment of manuscript from a good text of Marlowe's Massacre at Paris with the parallel text in the bad quarto. If a good text were subsequently published, convenience dictated the method. For The Merry Wives of Windsor the Folio printer was given an authoritative manuscript, which he set with no reference to the bad quarto. The unannotated bad quarto of Hamlet seems to have been consulted in the first act, where its reporting was best, to help the compositor of the good Second Quarto decipher the difficult manuscript from which he was setting. On the other hand, the third edition of Richard III's bad quarto was brought into general conformity with a playhouse manuscript by some agent and the result was used as setting copy for the Folio. Only by courtesy could this action be called 'revision,' for the copy was made up in lieu either of sending a manuscript to the printer that could not leave the playhouse, or by the printer as affording a quicker setting copy for his compositors than the manuscript furnished him. In no sense was an unauthorized bad text 'revised'; instead, a good text was substituted for it in toto—at least that was the intention. No comparison with a bad quarto can or should be made—in respect to copy-text—with such plays as Hamlet (presumably) but certainly Othello and Troilus which were also set up in the Folio from an annotated quarto that had been conflated with some manuscript. In these plays the original quarto text derived from an authorial manuscript, whether or not at some remove; hence its accidentals have a link with authority as well as its substantives. However, because of the memorial transmission of the text in a bad quarto, the transcriptional link with the author's manuscript is broken and its accidentals can have no possible authoritative origin. Under these circumstances it would be largely pointless to choose a bad quarto as copy-text and insert in its texture the more authoritative substantives of the good text. Naturally, the Folio's accidentals of Richard III have no presumptive authority either, except as the scribe may have been influenced by his manuscript in new text or (perhaps improbably) in collating fairly close passages that required less annotation. But however doubtful the authority may be, it is at least better than that of the Quarto, which in the case of Richard III does not even represent the period of the original printing. It follows that a reader could be misled at first when Greg writes, "So great and so detailed appears to have been the revision that it would be an almost impossible task to distinguish between variation due to the corrector and that due to the compositor, and an editor has no choice but to take the folio as copy-text." This criterion has no applicability whatever (as it has in Every Man in his Humour ) and the case is not altogether set to rights when Greg immediately adds, "Indeed, this would in any case be incumbent upon him for a different reason; for the folio texts are in some parts connected by transcriptional continuity with the author's manuscript, whereas the [bad] quartos contain, it is generally assumed, only reported text whose accidental characteristics can be of no authority whatever" (p. 391). This whole discussion of Richard III and of King Lear as examples of occasions when "a reprint may in practice be forced upon an editor as copy-text by the nature of the revision itself, quite apart from the question whether or not the author exercised any supervision over its printing" is useless for principle since its practice is so limited and the custom of treating these bad quartos is so established as not to require comment. They have no value in establishing a classification (to set against Every Man in his Humour ) of textual situations where the nature of the revision may force upon an editor a reprint as copy-text, "whether or not the author exercised any supervision over its printing" since the choice of copy-text in good texts versus bad memorial versions is established not by the quantity of the revisions but by the nature of the bad original, without authority for its accidentals. The point lies elsewhere. 26 What Greg needs to strengthen his argument are not hypothetical examples to add to Every Man since its editorial problem will so seldom arise; what in fact need illustration are (a) cases of true substantive collateral texts (for which no examples are given) and (b) further analysis of authorially revised editions not conforming to the quantitative criteria necessary to apply to Every Man but instead to the qualitative criteria applicable to Sejanus . It is particularly unfortunate that the first of these is neglected, for in modern times various combinations of (a) and of (b) may arise to plague an editor. What emerges is that Greg is not very satisfactory in dealing with texts of multiple authority when both are printed editions, and he omits entirely any discussion of the more common case of dual authority when one text is a printed edition and the other a manuscript. One problem that he did not face squarely is that the familiar examples of Elizabethan dual authority in printed editions are mixed, not independent; thus questions of copy-text are not much involved with the examples he gives but instead editorial judgment in the selection of the substantives as between the variants in the two editions. In fact, Greg does not rule on the copy-text that should be chosen for Hamlet , Troilus , Othello , and 2 Henry IV , and his paragraph about McKerrow's lack of attention to these plays is without point for his argument although he comes to lean on it. In context we may take it that he raised the issue of these plays because in discussing problem texts of the two authorities, and the treatment of readings, McKerrow's Prolegomena had practically confined itself to Richard III . Greg certainly approved of McKerrow's decision to use the Folio as copy-text for Richard III and in general to throw the weight of authority for the substantives on the Folio version as well; but he is interested in what McKerrow's views would have been about the substantives if he had lived to encounter the problems of Hamlet and the rest. Although Greg does not say so, it would seem that he believes McKerrow would have chosen the Quartos as copy-texts and would shortly have found that his rule would not have worked that in essence forbade a choice among the substantives, for he implies that McKerrow would have preferred many Folio substantives for these plays and would have run into trouble when he encountered, also, manifestly superior Quarto readings. Any real application here to copy-text is remote. For instance, on page 387 Greg starts to deal with true revised texts and notes McKerrow's position as earlier described on pages 378-381 but only in respect to The Unfortunate Traveller and according to a principle that McKerrow abandoned; and in contrast he refers the reader to his own emendation of McKerrow's rationale on pages 381-382. However, these pages mention only Hamlet and similar plays and immediately go on to illustrate the tyranny of copy-text in respect to substantives; it follows that his recapitulation on page 384 of his own position is in some part colored by the special cases of texts like Hamlet and the rest where questions of actual revision enter less frequently than the corruption of the lost original copy in the process of multiple transmission. It is once again the lack of distinction on Greg's part between variants that arise in the course of pre-publication transmission and those that result from post-publication transmission that causes difficulty. As a result the one clear statement (apart from the Jonson discussion on pages 389-390) that he makes about the problems of revision, on page 387, is less than comprehensive. He supposes that normal revision for a new edition will be made by an author sending a list of changes to the printer or else a corrected copy of an earlier edition. He then lays down a set of syllogisms to guide an editor in the choice of substantive variation, with one of which—the lesser authority of a revised edition in cases of doubt—I have a serious quarrel. But these syllogisms apply literally only to editions in linear relationship to each other, like the four revised editions of Joseph Andrews . They need modification (where Greg gives no guidance) for multiple pre-publication authority in textual situations like Hamlet , or Beggars Bush and Womans Prize , or (to jump ahead) Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage but more particularly, because of its simultaneous problem of copy-text and substantive authority, Crane's Third Violet , to say nothing of his "Price of the Harness," "Death and the Child," and "The Revenge of the Adolphus ." It is time to recapitulate and to see what emerges for editors of modern documents. Greg's rationale distinguishing the authority of substantives and accidentals is a sound one. However, a modern editor must always be aware that when he follows Greg he is not necessarily dealing with the same conditions and that the frame of reference may therefore alter in subtle ways that end with important differences. For example, when Greg writes "the historical circumstances of the English language make it necessary to adopt in formal matters [accidentals] the guidance of some particular early text" he is considering a problem of no application to late nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature. In Greg's early period in matters of accidentals the language was much more idiosyncratic and in process of flux than is true at the present time when standards of correctness exist that are relatively stable and simple to apply. Given the circumstances of transmission, Greg tacitly has little faith that in most cases more than the general characteristics of the period will be preserved by an insistence on the superior authority of the accidentals in the document closest to the lost manuscript. In multiple manuscripts it is clear that he has no faith at all that authorial characteristics can be recovered. In printed documents he recognizes the chance that something may come through, but it is clear he is not optimistic. The uncertainty about the effect of transmission has its effect on his discussion of the copy-texts suitable for Jonson according to his rationale. In contrast to Nashe, he recognizes that Jonson had some concern for the accidentals of a revised edition in a work like Sejanus and this leads him to sympathize with Simpson's selection of the Folio as copy-text although in the next moment he notes that in many respects the Quarto is the more logical choice. In opting for the Quarto in an independent edition he reflects his general position about Elizabethan accidentals in revised editions; in accepting Simpson's choice of the Folio he indicates his uncertainty as to how much of Jonson's marking of the Quarto as setting copy (and possibly of proof before printing began, as he thinks) might not have come through even though in such an unidentifiable form that it would not be practicable to isolate and transfer editorially from the Folio back into the Quarto copy-text as emendation. This indecision is symptomatic, it would seem, of a general view that the choice of copy-text on the basis of its accidentals is more a formal than a basically meaningful proposition, a convenience but not a great deal more. No editor of modern literature could feel in this way: in contrast to Elizabethan, the linguistic interest in the spellings of a modern author is minimal; what impels an editor of later works to concern himself with copy-text is the conviction that the accidentals are an inseparable whole with the substantives in transmitting the author's total meaning. That they have a literary interest, not merely a philological, marks a considerable difference in the point of view and very likely in the rationale for the selection of copy-text when revised editions are concerned, as well as the treatment of this copy-text once selected. Other differences are involved, however. A present-day editor who does not wish to normalize the accidents of his text chooses his copy-text and then generally retains its system not as a convenient guide but in the belief that he is relatively near to the formal features of the lost copy (in case of a first edition as copy-text) or the conviction (if he selects an authorial typescript or manuscript) that he is preserving an authentic example of the writer's own system. Ordinarily he will be right. However, if we inquire in what respects he believes the author's intentions are best preserved (apart from certain habits like word-division), an editor will ordinarily be forced to admit that he is basically referring to the punctuation as a significant guide to, and controller of, shades of meaning. (This is to omit consideration of alterations in syntax that properly come under the heading of substantives or at least semi-substantives.) Some authors may have highly idiosyncratic occasional spellings like Hawthorne's cieling (perhaps best emended, given his period); in other cases the idiosyncrasy is mild and easily preserved, as in the tendency for nineteenth-century American authors to adopt the -our spelling in the English manner for some words but not for others, 27 or to use s for z as in recognise , or connexion for connection , and so on. Rarely an author comes along like William James with a few pronounced views on spelling, such as his 'reform' tho (not the correct tho ') or excentric , and the like. In short, spelling is not ordinarily a part of an author's individual method of expression, whereas in Elizabethan times it is of especial importance to a scholar to attempt to reconstruct because of the possibility that phonetic spellings will guide us to clues about pronunciation or will offer evidence to assist the emendation of compositorial misreadings of peculiar forms. Note: It will be observed that Greg talks always in terms of spellings and not of the interest that may lie in the preservation of the punctuation of the period; in fact, on page 385 he suggests that if the copy-text punctuation is persistently erroneous or defective an editor may prefer to scrap it altogether for a system of his own. This comes after a statement that he sees no reason why an editor may not alter misleading or eccentric spellings "which he is satisfied emanate from the scribe or compositor and not from the author" (p. 385), 28 and indicates not only the lack of importance that he attaches, in comparison, to punctuation but also his apparent belief, shared by most scholars of the period, that whereas some distinctive manuscript punctuational characteristics filter through into printed texts (as witness the Ralph Crane parentheses in the Shakespeare Folio plays this scribe prepared), by and large whatever influence the accidentals of the copy might exercise on a compositor was more likely to be represented by the variable spelling. (It must also be confessed that some authorial and even scribal punctuation is so erratic as to be almost meaningless to preserve verbatim except in cases of possible ambiguity. Taking account of this condition, Moxon's seventeenth-century printers' manual advised the compositor to read ahead in the copy and to consider the sense carefully so that he could punctuate it properly when he came to set the type.) The transmission of spelling is most uneven, of course, depending upon the compositors. Compositor B of the First Folio is so firmly fixed in his ways that very little information about the underlying copy can be procured from his stints. On the other hand, the same two compositors who typeset the first edition of The Merchant of Venice in relatively conventional spelling also set the Second Quarto of Hamlet with rather eccentric spelling, this difference leading to the conjecture that Shakespeare's own papers may underlie the Hamlet print but probably a scribal manuscript the Merchant First Quarto (this last a new concept). Yet All's Well that Ends Well , also set almost certainly from Shakespeare's holograph, emerges at the later Folio date and in the work of three different compositors with spelling characteristics unlike those of the Second Quarto Hamlet . Nevertheless, how much spelling differences in the copy may in fact be reflected in the print, if one is fortunate, can be seen from a passage in the Beaumont and Fletcher 1647 Folio text of Beggars Bush . Because of an irregularity in the manuscript copy caused by the insertion of a speech on a separate piece of paper, the character Bertha is given a set of repeated lines, one from the original manuscript and the other from the added leaf by another hand. The accidentals differ significantly in the two versions, proving in this case the influence of copy upon the compositor: Ber . O I am miserably lost, thus falne Into my uncles hands from all my hopes, Can I not thinke away my selfe and dye? O I am miserably lost; thus fallen Into my Uncles hands, from all my hopes: . . . . . . . . Can I not thinke away my selfe and dye? (V.i.84-85, 98) A preserved scribal manuscript, probably at two removes from the original underlying the Folio, reads: O I am miserablie lost, thus faln into myne uncles hands from all my hopes can I not thinke away my selfe, and die? a good example, too, of unsatisfactory manuscript punctuation. Modern editing and Greg's rationale join in the wish to preserve as much as possible of the authorial accidentals, 29 but they do so for different purposes (critical versus philological) 30 and with markedly different results, even granting the information from preserved holograph documents about the accidents of a modern author available to the editor. It is a fair interpretation that so long as his major interest in editorial freedom of judgment was satisfied, Greg—knowing the uncertain basis of transmission—was prepared in general to accept as copy-text any document with reasonable claims to authority. He is firm, of course, that in a series of linear reprints without revision only the first edition will do, and he is firm that in cases where the revising author may be supposed to have paid little or no attention to the accidentals the first edition is also the proper copy-text. But for a situation like Sejanus in which there is evidence for the author's attention to the formal features in marking up the revised printer's copy, he is so much the reverse of doctrinaire as to be almost indifferent whether an editor chooses the Quarto or the Folio. This being so, modern critics are mistaken who apply Greg's rationale narrowly to revised texts and insist that the rationale requires the selection of the first edition (or of a manuscript or typescript) as copy-text, followed by the insertion of revised substantives into this earliest accidental texture. Greg does not lay down the law and is much more permissive than is generally supposed by those who take his remarks about The Unfortunate Traveller as the sole guide. More typical is: "The fact is that cases of revision differ so greatly in circumstances and character that it seems impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint. All that can be said is that if the original be selected, then the author's corrections must be incorporated; and that if the reprint is selected, then the original reading must be restored when that of the reprint is due to unauthorized variation. Thus the editor cannot escape the responsibility of distinguishing to the best of his ability between the two categories. No juggling with copy-text will relieve him of the duty and necessity of exercising his own judgement" (p. 390). 31 Modern editors must understand, however, that in Greg's view this emancipation applies only to the treatment of the substantives and that the copy-text accidentals are to be followed conservatively, as a convenience, except in the case of error. Once again it must be emphasized that to Greg Elizabethan accidentals are not really a part of the total meaning of a work in the modern manner of thought. This important distinction between the concepts has at least two consequences of importance for the present day. First, since the general texture of the accidentals at the present time is much more uniform than in the period with which Greg was concerned, the choice of copy-text transcends the grounds of expediency and must be recognized as having a critical significance beyond that which Greg conceived. Second, it follows that given the generally greater information about an author's accidentals possessed by an editor of modern documents, and often the wider range of preserved transmitted documents starting with drafts and ranging through typescripts and sometimes even proofs, an editor may be able to exercise his judgment in the choice of accidentals between competing authorities in a manner impossible for Greg to envisage as applying in the early period. It is true that the kind of accidental material on which an editor's critical judgment can operate is less susceptible of demonstration from the test of meaning than that applied critically to substantives. Nevertheless, although certain areas of accidentals may seem generally to be so indifferent in their variation as not to be subject to reasoned choice, a knowledgeable editor can deal with other areas on the same basis that Greg urges for the substantives. This new condition presents fresh problems that have not been much explored and where Greg can offer little guidance. Generalizations about the fidelity of the printer to his copy are dangerous in any age; but it is at least allowable that from the late seventeenth century when more uniformity in spelling and in standards of punctuation began to be imposed on compositors, the uncertainty that attaches to Elizabethan conditions of transmission begins to clear. Of course, all conclusions based on compositorial fidelity to setting from printed copy (the usual evidence) are not necessarily applicable to setting from manuscript: in any age printed copy, having been styled already, will be followed more faithfully by a compositor than he is likely to reproduce a manuscript which (until comparatively recent times) it was his duty to style on the author's behalf. 32 Nevertheless, the practical hopelessness an Elizabethan scholar feels about the problem of identifying authorial accidental characteristics imbedded in the variable systems of different compositors can begin to yield to modified optimism by the twentieth century, it would seem, and sometimes considerably earlier according to special conditions. With the change come certain modifications that may need to be applied to the popular interpretation of Greg's rationale. Obviously, when no anterior documents are preserved, the first edition is the substantive text and in lieu of further revision must become the copy-text instead of any later reprint. When revised editions are present, the modern editor has the same problem that exists in the Elizabethan choice of editorial method to deal with revision as between Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson; that is, he must attempt to find evidence that will permit him to evaluate whether the author confined himself chiefly to the revision of substantives or else included accidentals as well and on more than a casual basis. If the evidence suggests that substantives were the author's major concern, then it is probable that the edition nearest to the lost holograph—that is, the substantive first edition—should be retained as the copy-text. In this event the accidental variants can be winnowed for possible authorial changes as against publisher's and printer's, these assumed authorial markings to be inserted in the copy-text on the same basis as the revised substantives. The process is materially aided in the twentieth century by the fact that generalizations about transmissional variation appropriate for the age of Shakespeare are of lesser validity now. Note: One must also consider the differences in the kinds of departures from copy (questions of styling aside) that result from machine versus hand typesetting. The hand compositor memorized a certain portion of the text and then turned to his cases to set the types in his composing stick. Under these conditions his memory might betray him and it was easy inadvertently to substitute one word for another with the same general meaning, or to set the wrong word because of memorial contamination with other text in the memorized portion—the possibility of corruption increasing toward the end of the memorized piece of text. He was instructed carefully to consider the text before beginning to set it so that he could punctuate it properly according to the sense; but in addition the fact that setting was done with the eye off copy encouraged the substitution of compositorial for authorial accidental characteristics. On the contrary, the modern typesetter sits at his machine and sets copy like a typist with his eye constantly on the copy and ordinarily with comparatively little regard for the sense (which had to be paramount in hand setting). A good typesetter, or typist, transfers the symbols in his copy to his machine with his fingers almost by reflex action in automatic reproduction of what he sees, not necessarily reads in the usual sense of comprehension, the transference of thought as an act of will. As a result memorial errors are fewer, and although the omission of words (a common error) and occasional contaminations may plague an editor, many setting errors are mechanical and easily corrected. If one is fortunate, substitution or misreading may be confined to such examples as difference for different, like for unlike , and so on. When an editor decides that an author revising an edition has concerned himself in a meaningful way with marking accidentals for alteration, he has Greg's blessing for choosing the revised edition as copy-text. This choice is not one to be made lightly, however, nor without concrete documentary evidence relating either to the work itself or to other works with which the text under consideration shows common characteristics presumably arising from similar causes. For instance, a few examples of the marked periodical copy are preserved that William James used for his book collections, enough to demonstrate that he was every bit as concerned to modify his accidentals as his substantives before typesetting began. However, when the book shows further accidental as well as substantive changes from this revised copy, an editor must decide whether the accidental changes are again of a piece with the substantives or else may be mainly attributed to the printer. Comma for comma no editor can demonstrate that every individual difference is authorial; but enough general Jamesian idiosyncrasies come through to indicate that James was in the habit of heavily revising his book proofs even after he had carefully marked the printer's copy, and that these proof changes concerned the accidentals as well as the substantives. 33 As a result of a full analysis of James's revisory methods, in the James edition the volumes in which the periodical articles constitute the original texts and a book the revised reprint of these articles offer a critical text based on the final revision as copy-text. 34 Evidence for any one of these works is buttressed by identical evidence for the others. In its nature, for example, the evidence revealed by the collation of journals and book is practically interchangeable between Pragmatism and The Meaning of Truth , indication of James's customary scrupulous revision of book copy and then of the proof of both volumes, even though no corrected book proof-sheets have been preserved as documentary evidence. 35 It can be said, then, that the important evidence should be sought in two parts before a revised edition can be made the copy-text with any confidence: first, firm evidence that the author revised the formal features of his text as well as the substantives whether in the press copy or in proofs or in both; 36 and, second, some evidence when obtainable about the degree of fidelity given by the printer to the press copy, this as an assistance in estimating the influence of the author on the altered accidentals. Note: This analysis of the printer's share in variant accidentals is also an assistance if the editor proposes to emend the copy-text in favor of known authorial forms whenever the printer has imposed his own identifiable and contrary styling. For example, it was the Riverside Press's housestyling in the early 1900s to enclose all quotations in single quotation marks whereas James preferred double. One or more of the Riverside compositors spelled more words with the -our ending than James, who confined himself to colour and usually to honour . Compositors at the Riverside and also at the University Press in Cambridge at this time generally set a comma before a dash although James seldom writes a comma except inadvertently when in his manuscripts he has altered a comma to a dash and forgets to delete the original mark. Matters like these need not influence the selection of copy-text away from a revision, for they are easily identified and emended by reference to the setting copy or else they may be 'normalized' when present in what have clearly been holograph additions in the preparation of copy for a revised edition. In short, when a writer's accidentals are familiar to an editor, in certain clearly delineated respects much can be done to evaluate the authority of at least some classes of variants in a revised edition. If a writer has unfortunately chosen some other copy than a substantive one to annotate in preparation for a revised edition, and if this selected text is suspect in its accidental differences from the first (as if it is a mere reprint of the substantive without authority or if the writer in its preparation had revised a few readings but had paid little if any attention to the accidentals), certainly an editor may wish to work over the latest revised-edition copy-text by correcting back to their first-edition forms those accidental variants that originated in the unauthoritative press copy and were passed on to the revision, this despite any suggestion that by failing to alter them in the revision the writer was 'approving' them. One may grant that perhaps only the tip of the iceberg can be sawed off by such a procedure: the accidentals in a revised edition demonstrably stemming from the printer and hence subject to correction may comprise only a few categories; nevertheless, in my own view any such purification of a text by substituting the authorial for the printer's style is worth the effort. In many respects I admire John M. Robson's account of his solution of the various editorial problems that arose in the John Stuart Mill edition. From the little I know of the matter I am not inclined to quarrel with his bold choice of the later revised editions as copy-texts even though I am concerned that expediency may have bulked too large in his defence of the procedure. But I am made uneasy by his general acceptance of Greg's Elizabethan principle of following the accidentals of a chosen copy-text conservatively and altering them only for positive error. (For a modern editor 'error,' I believe, must include any printer's identifiable departure from an author's form of accidental, although Greg would certainly not have wished to extend the definition this far.) The confinement of editorial activity largely to the substantives is a strictly Elizabethan editorial attitude fostered by the frank admission that in most early texts no means exist to identify authorial accidentals. However, it does not seem to me to be an appropriate position to take, no matter what the age, when the authorial form is known. For example, in my view it was a Folio 'error' in Sejanus to print equall when the Quarto copy read aequall since Jonson could never have approved or marked such a change in his copy; in these circumstances Herford-Simpson were ill-advised to retain equall in their critical text simply because they had chosen the Folio as copy-text. Correspondingly, if a book printer of William James set though or eccentric when the periodical copy read tho and excentric , not to correct the revised copy-text to agree with the certain authorial preferred form seems to me indefensible. If so, it may seem equally indefensible not to emend book though in the same essay if encountered in a passage that would have been added in autograph to the revised copy, for the copy-text 'error' is just as evident. I argue this not alone on grounds of uniformity—of the anomaly in a modern critical text (though not in an Elizabethan one) of two different spellings within the same unit—but also on the grounds that to follow the copy-text though is to perpetuate an 'error' that the editor would reject were it a substantive. Editors are inclined to treat accidentals as second-class citizens: I do not agree whenever the individual case is such that an editor has as good (if not a better) basis for a reasoned choice as that he enjoys for the emendation of the copy-text's substantives. The pertinent passage in Dr. Robson's essay ( Editing Nineteenth Century Texts , pp. 116-117) runs as follows: Simply . . . we have held that [the accidental texture of the revised] version in Dissertations and Discussions is given sufficient authority by Mill's approval of it. There can be little doubt that the normalization that occurred in the revised versions is a result both of Mill's and the printing-house's actions; I am convinced that he also had a hand in the altered punctuation. That he is solely responsible is an untenable view, but the irregular variations in accidentals in the periodical versions indicate as strongly as anything could that what is found in them seriously differs from Mill's intention through editorial and compositorial practices and carelessness. I should myself like to go back beyond the Ur-text to the ideal Platonic text that never found concrete embodiment, but we have not found it practicable—nor do we think for our purposes it is necessary—to make as detailed a study of printing-house and compositorial habits and practice as would permit a more informed guess about responsibility for particular accidentals and patterns of accidentals. Electronic aids may eventually make such a study practicable, but we have not stayed for an answer to the question which we believe is in Mill's case relatively unimportant. My unease is really with the argument that Mill's 'approval' constitutes such overwhelming authority in a revised-edition copy-text that an editor may decline to emend by reference to earlier authority such accidentals as he felt were demonstrably not Mill's. This is a far cry from a computer concordance that might or might not serve as the evidential basis for an overall attempt at deciding each and every detail between the printer and Mill. I seriously doubt that for punctuation such an 'ideal Platonic text' is possible for any author. I am suggesting, chiefly, that half a loaf is better than none if one takes accidental authority as seriously as substantive authority . 37 If an editor chooses to apply to modern authors the criterion of linguistic expediency Greg felt forced to defend, then our positions are so far apart that argument can scarcely be heard across the gap. It does seem to me, however, that if in Mill's case the accidentals are 'relatively unimportant,' the assertion should be illustrated and the text modernized. Certainly if there is to be one rule for creative writers and another for economists and philosophers and historians, perhaps the subject is worth some interested discussion to clarify the respective positions. In my own experience, I should say that the accidentals are more important in the text of the philosopher William James than in the several prose fiction writers I have edited; that is, if the attention James paid to them in print in contrast to the others is a criterion. If any discussion about the importance of accidental fidelity in editions of writers of different kinds were to develop, one of the first problems would be to clarify the role of 'authorial approval.' Strictly speaking, all a proponent can assert is that the writer has tacitly 'approved' the accidentals of the press copy by declining to alter them in the preparation of a revised edition. 38 This is a severely limited but logically defensible position although painful to anyone who would like to see identifiable authority in accidentals restored. However, the printed result may differ from the setting copy. In some cases variation may be so indifferent that no decision is possible whether the writer or the printer was on the whole responsible (although in such neutral circumstances the printer is usually blamed). In others, an editor may feel strongly that the writer has intervened, whether in the lost copy or in proof. In still others, the variation is of a nature readily assignable to the printer. In this last category, and perhaps in the first, the question then arises whether by the act of reading proof (if this act can be established) and failing to alter the printer's differences from the original 'approved' copy the author has made a further act of approval that can cover these variants, on the simple ground of non-interference whether or not in fact he may have noticed their variation. 39 I believe this second proposition is less defensible than the first; nevertheless, it is equally pertinent and hence affects the first. The question often overlooked by advocates of authorial blanket approval is this: which style was approved—printer's copy or final result? What if an author did not read proof for a revised edition but was confident that the publisher could handle the situation. Is he then responsible for having 'approved' the printed result as well as the press copy? The whole matter goes much deeper, however, and into areas too large to discuss here. Prominent is the question whether an author's acceptance of publisher's or printer's styling constitutes 'approval' sufficiently valid and meaningful to be utilized by an editor as a basis for judgment about copy-text. More copy-text problems are raised by the preservation of manuscripts and typescripts than can be covered here, especially since the textual situation may be complicated by a subsequent revision of the original substantive document. Textual situations may range from editions produced directly from holograph or from authorial typescript with little authorial attention in proof, to professional typescripts with their peculiar problems of authority and 'approval,' and on to circumstances of extreme complexity in which an author may so rework a manuscript by revising the typescript made from it as to destroy in major part the efficacy of manuscript authority except for a casual accidental here and there, as with D. H. Lawrence's The Rainbow (private information from Dr. Charles Ross). Or as happened with James's A Pluralistic Universe , the author may have revised the typescript of the book once, and then independently further revised parts of another copy of the typescript to prepare copy for the periodical publication of some of the lectures before the book was issued, and finally read proof on each form without reference to the other. The manuscript of A Pluralistic Universe is the only pre-publication document preserved; but James's treatment of it, as manifested in the considerably altered journal and book texts, suggests the view (supported by other parallels) that he really regarded his manuscripts as drafts both for substantives and for accidentals, to be revised and perfected by reworking any typescripts made from them but with the major revision likely to occur in galley proof (those being spacious days). Under these conditions (as worked out in detail in the ACLS edition for the Harvard University Press, 1977), the finally revised book was selected as the most appropriate copy-text. It will be seen that we are here in an area of substantially different problems (not always so recognized, as remarked in the discussion of Greg's examples of revision) in which revision is pre-publication and not, except as a separate problem, represented by such post-publication revision as is found in James's Pragmatism or in Mill, or in Nashe and Jonson as against the example of pre-publication revision in Troilus and Cressida . In pre-publication revision one may need to deal with such transmissional variation as that created by one or more typescripts (Stephen Crane's Active Service ) and, inevitably, with variation from manuscript or typescript due to the compositor(s) of the first edition ( The Red Badge of Courage ), with an eye out for publishers' readers. Frequently documentary links in the chain of transmission are wanting and their reconstruction difficult if not impossible except on such a hypothetical basis as to be nearly valueless for evidence. Under the more extreme of these circumstances, any preserved manuscript or early typescript material assumes an almost overriding importance unless it appears to the editor that the author has entered the transmissional process at a later stage than the preserved documents and in such a significant manner affecting the accidentals as to promote some perhaps final document like the first edition to superior overall authority in the choice of copy-text based on the accidentals in the classic Greg rationale. This last was the case with A Pluralistic Universe , and it resulted in the defensible choice of the first edition as copy-text over the manuscript on the grounds that the evidence indicated that the majority of the accidental differences could be imputed to the author. On the contrary, this evidence was wanting in the textual history of Hawthorne's romances The Blithedale Romance , The House of the Seven Gables , and The Marble Faun . The reasons for the selection of the manuscripts as the copy-texts for editions of these Hawthorne works have been fully discussed in the textual introductions of the Centenary Edition and pinpointed further in my "Practical Texts and Definitive Editions," Essays , pp. 412-439). Basically, several thousand accidental differences in each text appeared between the printer's-copy manuscript and the first edition. On the whole these could not be imputed to Hawthorne (a) since they often ran contrary to the established uniform characteristics of all the manuscripts taken as a group, (b) since even without reference to the above it would be absurd anyway to believe that Hawthorne made so many accidental alterations in proof, and (c) since the amount of accidental variation from manuscript differed among the identified compositors who set the first editions. The general authority of the manuscript accidentals as against those of the first edition thus being established as a working hypothesis, and the manuscript selected as copy-text, the copy-text accidentals were reproduced with relatively few exceptions—these deriving mainly from first-edition correction of positive errors and oversights and from a few forms that seemed characteristic of Hawthorne and conjecturable as his proof-alterations like the similarly slight alteration in proof of the substantives. In these examples of direct linear derivation, the editor had two primary documents of printer's-copy manuscript and printed book. Missing, and their details to be reconstructed by conjecture, were the intervening proofs. Since Hawthorne was not a copious rewriter of his works in proof, the want of these was not such a serious loss as with an author of a different kind. The evidence of the proofs was not really required to demonstrate how much the compositors had altered Hawthorne's intricate parenthetical punctuation system in the interests of simplification although they would have been useful, of course, in positively identifying whatever few accidental (and substantive) changes he did make. Other examples may hold as well even though the linear transmission has not been so fully preserved in the documents. Stephen Crane's manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage was professionally typed; a copy of this lost typescript, further revised by the author and probably looked over by Ripley Hitchcock, the Appleton editor (although the depth and extent of any correction are obscure), 40 was given to the printer of the first edition. Missing are not only the proofs (only a negative loss since Crane was a careless and reluctant proofreader) but, more important, the marked-up typescript the original of which certainly contained corruptions that were passed on to the first edition. 41 Viewed as a whole, the first edition is more likely than not to smooth over the idiosyncrasies of Crane's accidentals. It follows that the manuscript reproduces in a more faithful manner than any other preserved (or conjecturally reconstructable) document the peculiar characteristics of Crane's accidentals, eminently worth saving for their flavor and their stylistic effect—often affecting rhythm and pace—and hence it is the most suitable copy-text. In this particular example the existence of the collateral newspaper texts does not affect the copy-text authority, for these stem from a second copy of the typescript in an unrevised state and are at best useful when they agree with the manuscript against the book, or with the book against the manuscript, in establishing the typescript readings and thus in helping to isolate post-manuscript alteration as authorial or as unauthoritative. These newspaper versions have been so seriously condensed from the full version and in part editorially rewritten as to be of little use in emending accidentals, as are the newspaper versions of Crane's Third Violet , however. The above examples concern different aspects of authorial prepublication intervention in the transmission of a text which has a direct linear relationship between the preserved authorities, even with missing intermediate documents whose essential features can be reconstructed without insuperable difficulty. Greg's rationale, based on post-publication revision, operates with equal efficiency on simple conditions of pre-publication revision as in Hawthorne; but for more complex cases one must include his recognition (even though generally expressed) that conditions may enforce the selection of a later revised document over an earlier authority if the accidentals appear to be more authoritative. However, questions of multiple authority, as remarked in his references to Hamlet and allied Shakespearean plays, are not satisfactorily resolved in the "Rationale." In multiple authority as found in modern editorial problems the main point of investigation is to establish as specifically as possible whether diverse authority is what may be called technical (or mechanical) in the sense that variation is due exclusively to the transmissional process or whether one branch is weighted by authorial revision. In the first case all documents may be technically of equal accidental authority if at equal distances from the archetype; or they may be of unequal technical authority if some documents are further removed than others. But no matter how equal or unequal the distances, no fresh authority has entered the transmission at any point either directly or by reference. In the second case, a decision needs to be made whether authorial intervention has increased the authority of one line chiefly in respect to the substantives (only casual attention probably having been given to the accidentals) or whether there is evidence that the alteration of accidentals bulked sufficiently large so that accidental variation must be treated with as serious a scrutiny for authority as substantive differences. The purest example of technical multiple authority that I know of comes in Stephen Crane's "The Price of the Harness," sent in manuscript (now lost) from Cuba to his agent in New York who had a professional typescript (now lost) made from it. One copy of this typescript was sold to the Cosmopolitan in the United States and the other to the British magazine Blackwood's . Crane could have read proof on neither. Because of their immediate radiation from the same typescript with no opportunity for authorial revision, both printed versions have technically the same authority for the accidentals (and in this case for the substantives). The choice of copy-text is one of convenience only and meaningless in principle. It follows that the accidentals of the critically edited text must be drawn freely from both versions according as the editor judges one or the other to reproduce Crane's particular characteristics (as filtered through the typescript) the more faithfully. The same freedom of choice is required for the accidentals as Greg adjures for substantives, and the reproduction of the accidents of one authority in Greg's and the modern conservative manner would be illogical and anomalous. 42 Crane's novel Active Service in some part illustrates unequal authority in two arms of radiation. One copy of the typescript that Cora Crane made from the lost manuscript is preserved, this being the setting copy used by Heinemann for the first English edition. A second copy was sent to the publisher Stokes in the United States, who—dissatisfied with Cora's bad typing—had a fresh typescript made from it to use as setting copy for the American edition. The manuscript being lost, the preservation of one copy of the original typescript is basically all that matters to an editor; since Crane's proof-corrections are few or nonexistent, the typescript must be the copy-text and there is no true radiation by the American branch but only derivation. Hypothetically, of course, if the typescript had not been preserved, the two editions would have radiated from this lost document, which would need to be reconstructed from the evidence of their multiple authority, although with lesser weight given to the Stokes edition because of its more distant relationship to the archetype (if this fact could itself have been recovered). Actually the case is more complicated than the preservation of the typescript suggests. From time to time the preserved typescript copy-text is wanting or defective, at which points the Heinemann edition becomes the copy-text as one step nearer to lost authority than the Stokes; but in these places it is proper to correct the Heinemann copy-text by reference to the accidentals of the radiating American edition if these are thought to preserve the formal features of the typescript more faithfully than the English. In Chapter V of the novel by an extraordinary accident the Heinemann typescript is entirely missing but is replaced by the corresponding pages of the American transcript, which had been used in this place as the setting copy for the English edition, the American edition by mirror image being printed from the lost section of the original typescript. In this chapter both the preserved typescript and the Stokes edition radiate at equal removes from the lost original and, as in all situations of multiple authority, the choice of copy-text becomes one of expediency (or convenience)—in this case the American typescript may be taken to have preserved the accidental features of the original more accurately on the whole than the Stokes edition set from Cora's original. Whenever Cora's typescript is preserved, questions of authority may slightly weight the matter of copy-text even though—for Crane, whose revision of accidentals was minimal either in the pre- or post-publication stage—these are likely to concern the substantives more than the accidents. That is, the early ribbon part of the original typescript has no written-in authorial revisions, whereas the later carbon section is occasionally corrected and revised. Because this revision agrees substantially with the distinction between ribbon copy and carbon, there is a chance that the copy sent to the United States (although in batches) contained such revisions in its early carbon section which would have been perpetuated in the American edition. One may still feel slightly uncomfortable about this possibility since some of the evidence is contradictory although on the whole against the presence of such authority in the earlier part of the Stokes edition. Even if authority were to be demonstrated, however, the likelihood of Crane's formal alterations, such as they would be, being recognizable after passing through another typing and then the American compositor(s) is so minimal as not to disturb the choice of the preserved typescript as copy-text throughout except for Chapter V and a few minor gaps. Distance from the archetype is not an automatic rationale to apply without a full evaluation of the evidence. For instance, one copy of the typescript of Crane's Third Violet was sold to a newspaper syndicate which set it up in proofs that in turn were distributed to six known subscribing newspapers as setting copy for their compositors. The other example of the typescript, almost a year later, was used to set the book, somewhat revised by Crane in the interval. In editing this work it was most convenient to choose as copy-text the radiating arm represented by the book, in part because it was one stage closer to the lost typescript than any newspaper, in part because during the revision Crane could have altered any of the typescript accidentals that he did not like (not a probable hypothesis for any extensive alteration but still a possibility), and in part because of the difficulty of utilizing as copy-text a synthetic reconstruction of the lost syndicate proofs made from the evidence of the six newspapers. This latter operation would yield an exact account of the substantives but a less exact even though tolerably full account of the accidents. (Of course, insofar as the syndicate proofs can be reconstructed, they and the book are at equal distance from the typescript: the only problem remains the fact that we know the book's accidentals precisely, whereas in various details some of the proofs' punctuation, for example, must remain conjectural owing to the newspapers' conflicting evidence.) On the other hand, the book shows the effects of publisher's editing (probably) and of compositorial styling (certainly); as a result, in many respects the accidentals of the newspapers reconstructing the lost proofs are closer to Crane's characteristics than the book's despite the latter's more immediate derivation. As a result, a critical text produced from such radiating authority had to be very much a combination of book and reconstructed syndicate proofs, the total evidence attempting to reproduce as closely as possible the accidents as well as the substantives of the lost typescript, the farthest back a reconstruction can penetrate. In similar manner the periodical texts of four of William James's Pluralistic Universe lectures in the Hibbert Journal could be balanced against the book to reconstruct in many respects the accidentals of the lost typescript from which each derived at equal distance. Any choice between journal and book as copy-text for this work would be superfluously theoretical; nevertheless, in the editing process the reconstructed accidental characteristics of the lost typescript were of real concern since some of their variance from the preserved manuscript could be attributed to James's own revision. It may now be possible to sharpen some of the essential differences between the Elizabethan conditions with which Greg's rationale was contrived to deal and those of later periods to which editors now attempt to apply the formulas, with whatever conclusions can be drawn about the modifications that appear to be required in principle or in procedures. Insofar as the single matter of copy-text is concerned, Greg's rationale and his illustrations are centered on the problem whether a linear post-publication revised edition or the original substantive edition makes the superior copy-text, this choice having nothing to do, however, with the second matter of the editorial judgment that will select the most authoritative substantives from the two editions. Throughout he ignores the question of holograph versus first edition as copy-text simply because in his period this problem seldom arises. Even so, an example lay to his hand in the Jonson Masque of Queens which Simpson had edited in volume VII of the Works (1941) in a diplomatic transcript of the holograph. The problems in The Masque of Queens in effect differ little from those facing an editor of Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables , even though the transmission of the text is not the same and there are added complications in the Jonson: in each the question arises of the extent to which accidental variants that appear to be authoritative can be identified in a restyled printed text and utilized in a critical edition that takes the manuscript as copy-text. In Hawthorne these are the proof-alterations he made; in Jonson the revisions occurred in the ancestral working papers he sent to the printer after making the preserved fair copy from the unrevised text, 43 with some chance that he also read proofs. The same also applies to the problems met with in A Pluralistic Universe when a manuscript is preserved but not the printer's-copy typescript made from it, a typescript that contained accidental as well as substantive revision in James's hand (corresponding to Jonson's revisions in his working papers except that the James is the more complex problem owing to the intermediate non-authorial typescript whose details are only partly reconstructable where they differed from the manuscript). In the Hawthorne the editor chose the manuscript as copy-text since the identifiable and even the probable authorial accidental revisions in proof were vastly outnumbered by the printer's variants from the manuscript copy. On the contrary, the editor of James chose the printed edition as copy-text on the mirror-image of this situation; that is, the evidence that the printed edition was the culmination of a series of authorial revisions during its pre-publication transmission from original manuscript and constituted a more authoritative document, on the whole, than even the holograph representation of the accidentals. Naturally, possibilities of this nature could not have been contemplated by Greg even if he had tackled the more elementary cases of holograph versus printed edition as, in some part, in The Masque of Queens . It follows that any modern attempt to impose an absolute rule that an author's manuscript is sacrosanct as copy-text finds no support in Greg and has been extrapolated from his illustrations of the transmission of accidentals from one printed edition to another, a quite different matter. Indeed, Greg less understandably (since these are in greater supply in his period) fails to mention the problems of copy-text that arise in the choice between a printed edition and a scribal manuscript as in Fletcher's Beggars Bush , Woman's Prize , and Bonduca , as well as Suckling's Aglaura . Again, these occur in the considerable area in which a reader draws a blank in Greg—that of pre-publication textual history that may or may not involve authorial revision but that ends in producing at least two different documents with claims to authority as copy-text. This leaves wide open for an editor any Elizabethan parallels between scribes and modern typists, or other interveners in the transmission of a text such as the friends who assisted T. S. Eliot or Charles Dickens in the reading and alteration of proofs. The limitation of problems of copy-text to the specific post-publication circumstance of an author revising one edition to produce another fails to offer any guidance in the important questions of multiple authority affecting decisions of copy-text as found either in Fletcher's plays or in Crane's Third Violet . In these days in which recording media are joining print as authoritative documents, and a poet reading his own verses may be subject to unofficial as well as official tape recording, something of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century conditions of multiple copies of variant texts, with their derivatives, are being reproduced although it is true that these have only a tangential relationship to accidental variation except as it could be reconstructed from pauses and the like. Nevertheless, questions of copy-text based on the matter of accidentals may not prove so simple in these cases. What we come down to in the end is the conclusion (which actually has far-reaching consequences for the relation of the "Rationale" to the editing of modern authors) that Greg's interest in the accidentals of a text was minimal compared to his concern for the free exercise of editorial judgment in respect to the substantives. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century conditions of transmission, whether through scribes or compositors, left small chance, or at least much uncertainty, that very much of the authorial accidental characteristics were preserved in a print—and the usual absence of authorial manuscripts to act as a guide meant that what had been preserved could not be distinguished from compositorial accidentals. In these circumstances there is little choice but to take as copy-text the document (it is simpler to think basically in terms of documents and not of editions) that is closest to authority in these respects, obviously the first edition when all antecedent documents (scribal or authorial manuscripts) have not been preserved. After this decision Greg's subsequent concern is only with the specific case of Every Man in his Humour in which extensive authorial revision has so altered the substantives as to enforce general acceptance of the Folio accidentals that accompany the altered wording. (All procedures for bad quartos which Greg considers are basically of no value as evidence for the present day.) The general conditions of Greg's period, then, encouraged his view that the chief importance of the formal features of the copy-text outside of their unknown and unknowable relation to the author was to establish the most linguistically suitable texture for the substantives—not the most authoritative accidentals on a demonstrable basis but the nearest to the general texture of the period of the work's composition. This attitude then leads to the principle that an editor can even scrap the copy-text punctuational system and substitute his own, although he should give "due weight to the original in deciding on his own." 44 "Much the same applies to the use of capitals and italics" (p. 385). This contrast helps to point the difference between the linguistic interest for Greg of the spelling and the lack of critical interest in punctuation and rest. It is interesting to notice that for an editor of later literature the importance of these two concerns has been precisely reversed. Greg's natural pessimism about the specific authority of accidentals tends to widen the gap between the editorial treatment he envisages as suitable for them and for substantives and ends by removing the accidentals in major part from the function of the editorial judgment appropriate for the substantives. Once again, Greg's concern for the post-publication transmission of texts in linear revised editions prevents him from considering other conditions (even though they may seem to constitute special cases) in which something can be done with the choice of copy-text between two competing non-linear authorities as in the manuscripts and the printed texts in the Beaumont and Fletcher 1647 Folio, and in the possibilities for emending the copy-text accidentals from other authority. In this latter respect he shows practically no interest in the emendation of the accidentals that should demand editorial attention even in the linear original and revised texts of Sejanus . It is this ignoring of the possibilities that exist in some early works for the judgmental treatment of certain classes of accidents on a par with the substantives that creates the gravest difficulties when the "Rationale" is narrowly applied to the editing of modern works. One can be a rebel to Greg's general though not absolute advice to seek one's copy-text in the earliest authority, as is Dr. Robson's editorial board for the Mill's edition, and still fall into the trap of preserving Greg's conservative views on the opportunities for authoritative emendation of the copy-text accidentals. This attitude has had, apparently, a serious effect on modern editing where the amount of information available about authorial characteristics equals and normally surpasses that preserved for Jonson and puts matters on quite a different plane from Shakespeare and other typical early writers who bulked large in Greg's mind. The effect is found, of course, precisely where Greg's own gaps occur: the possibility that the accidentals of a revised edition may be more authoritative than those of an earlier edition closer to lost original authority, and even that a printed first edition may be more authoritative in its formal features than the holograph manuscript from which it ultimately derives. That either exception is possible save under the rarest and most special of circumstances has been vigorously denied by some modern converts to Greg's textual theories. In fact, this denial is justified only in cases of a limited authorial interest in the revision of accidentals, these being the commonest conditions an editor may encounter in dealing with revisions. But the less common although by no means highly exceptional examples of the contrary, as occur in the writings of Walt Whitman and William James, are being supported as more editors tackle writers outside of the limited scope of nineteenth-century American fiction. James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence come to mind. Until editors have had more experience with the special cases of revised editions as copy-texts it is not possible to lay down more than a few specific guidelines, with the advice to seek out and study the examples of this editorial procedure in order to acquaint oneself at first hand with its theory and practice. However, it would seem that several criteria must be satisfied before a revised edition can become a superior copy-text. 45 First, evidence must exist, or be conjectured with major probability, that the author revised his text not only in the substantives but with more than casual attention to the accidentals; second, evidence should be sought that the printer of the revised text was relatively faithful to his copy, or was made so by scrupulous authorial proofreading, so that the author's accidental texture has not been restyled in any thoroughgoing way. If these two criteria are met, then a third may be examined. Briefly, an editor needs to examine his collations of the variant accidentals to determine what categories are manifestly authorial and what are manifestly compositorial. These two groups should be isolated, for since they constitute the classes of accidentals that are as subject to critical selection or discard as are the substantives, technically they need have no more influence on the choice of copy-text than do the substantives. This is an important point in the revised rationale I am suggesting. The copy-text is chosen on the basis of its accidentals according to Greg, for in his opinion these constitute a body not subject to the selective judgment he advocated for the substantives. The choice based on the accidentals is still (and no doubt invariably) sound in my opinion for any period although the reasons for the significance of accidentals in a text have shifted materially since the Elizabethan period. When conditions in later authors approximate those that influenced Greg to advocate as a general rule the earliest document (meaning the one closest to the authorial archetype), the rationale is also valid in both its parts. For instance, the evidence strongly suggests that in collecting the 1837 Twice-Told Tales from their various newspaper and magazine appearances Hawthorne performed a minimum of revision in the printer's copy and in proof; hence the accidentals of the originals, set from holograph, are more authoritative than those of the book reprint, although not necessarily reproducing exactly what would have appeared in the lost manuscripts. 46 This was post-publication revision of the kind that Greg recognizes. In pre-publication revision, the evidence suggests that the vast majority of the variant accidentals in the printed texts of Hawthorne's romances belong to the compositors and that some of the relatively few accidental alterations he may be supposed to have made in proof from the forms of the printer's-copy manuscripts are often unrecognizable. In earlier literature the case of the revised second and third editions of Dryden's Indian Emperour may again be cited as examples under (b) of an author whose accidental revisions may be thought (on some concrete evidence from the press-corrections in one forme of the second edition) to have been significant from time to time; but they are insufficiently idiosyncratic to be recognized among the far larger number of compositorial variants, and therefore the best copy-text is either the scribal manuscript of a slightly earlier version or else the first edition. 47 Again in earlier literature, it would seem that whereas Sejanus meets the first test, in that Jonson may be taken to have revised copy for the Folio with some care for its accidentals, the second test—the general fidelity of the Folio printer—appears to be failed. Thus a doubt is raised, although somewhat less than with Dryden, about the amount of compositorial departure from copy in the Folio text. When one proceeds to the third test, in order to see if the doubt may be resolved, an editor finds it possible to isolate several ranges of Jonson's idiosyncratic accidentals that beyond question represent his markings in the Quarto printer's copy. These may be put aside (like the F press-corrections) since for the moment they should not affect the selection of copy-text. The clearcut compositorial variants are less useful, representing as they do only the Folio departure from recognizably Jonsonian characteristics found in the Quarto copy. At this point an editor may discover that the remaining accidental variants (chiefly punctuation) are still fairly numerous. If surveying these he comes to believe that on the whole they are more likely than not to represent the F compositors' variants, then he should choose Q as his copy-text since the Q accidentals in this particular category will probably reproduce more authority as a group than those in F. The set-aside idiosyncratic accidentals can then be inserted in the Q copy-text as authorial revisions holding the same status as the F authoritative substantive variants. On the other hand, if the editor is still uncertain about the neutral category of the accidentals and has some evidence from parallels to take it that, although each separate one is not identifiable, the probability rests that on the whole they are more likely in F to reproduce Jonsonian markings in copy (and perhaps undetected proof-correction changes if this evidence has not been exhausted) than compositorial variation from Q, then revised F becomes the natural copy-text. If so, it is the duty of the editor to correct those accidentals in F that appear to be unauthoritative by drawing on Q for the corresponding versions. To repeat, the probability on what evidence is available about the author and his characteristics (and the printer) that a majority of the generally unassignable accidental variants is authorial or compositorial should be the ultimate determinant in the selection of copy-text as between two authorities, whether an original and a revised edition, or two collateral editions. 48 For example, it was this general sense of the authority of the indeterminate class of accidental variants between the partially reconstructed syndicate newspaper proofs and the first edition of Crane's Third Violet that finally dictated the selection of the first edition as copy-text. Under other circumstances when no question of revision was present, the Boston Museum version of Hawthorne's "Ethan Brand" appears to have received less house-styling than another publication in the Dollar Magazine (both radiating at equal distance from lost printed sheets from an unpublished magazine set from manuscript). Although the Dollar Magazine clipping was the printer's copy for the later appearance in The Snow-Image (1851), no evidence is preserved to indicate that Hawthorne had prepared it with any revisions. Hence an editor may believe that the copy-text offering maximum general authority, such as it is, is the Boston Museum (Centenary Edition, XI, 417-419). Compositorial studies showing unequal levels of variation from copy according to the stints were among the other evidence in Hawthorne's romances that led to the establishment of the manuscripts as the most trustworthy source for the accidentals as a whole. With a more complicated transmission from preserved manuscripts (in large part) through periodical publication to book collection, despite considerable substantive revision in the process the manuscript accidentals for Hawthorne's Our Old Home (1863) remained on the whole the more authoritative, also. In another situation the grave difficulty of accepting in the first edition of The Red Badge of Courage a number of what appeared to be sophisticating accidentals not necessarily Crane's and far more numerous from the manuscript than could be attributed to his marking of the typescript printer's copy and the book proofs, led to the selection of the manuscript as on the whole the best repository of the authoritative accidentals of this work. As a marked contrast, when one approaches such a typical William James text as A Pluralistic Universe , each criterion for copy-text may be satisfied in favor of the general authority of the revised edition's accidentals. Briefly, preserved documents for other works in its period demonstrate the frequency of James's attention to accidentals in preparing printer's copy and in the revision of a book's galley-proofs. Second, the evidence of Some Problems of Philosophy indicates that the Riverside Press was exceptionally faithful in setting the accidents of his copy except for a few categories of housestyling that can be readily isolated. In the third test, although some of James's idiosyncratic accidentals had clearly been inserted in the book as deliberate alterations of the typescript (and manuscript), a large number of the book's punctuation changes could not be so precisely assigned to James in clearly defined categories; nevertheless, in the majority of cases they were either consistent with his favorite although not invariable practices or else were, at the least, not inconsistent. Various of the book's changes could be easily interpreted as James's attempts to make consistent and formal the more informal system of a manuscript that was in effect not much more than a draft which James had always intended to revise thoroughly before publication. Since evidence within the book and the journals existed for James's concern in revising his accidentals during the stages of the copy's transmission from manuscript through typescript to final print, and since the majority of the relatively indifferent variants did not seem to be assignable to the printer either on internal or external evidence, the book became the natural copy-text. The chief editorial problem for the accidentals, then, was the identification of the Press's styling so that it could be removed in favor of the authorial forms from the manuscript but with some reference as well to the possibility of post-typescript revision in the Hibbert Journal publication not transferred to the book. All this was pre-publication revision of course. Post-publication revision of the same nature and with the same problems occurs in the essays in Pragmatism , The Meaning of Truth , and The Will to Believe in which journal articles were revised to serve as printer's copy for the book and the revision of the text in both its aspects continued in the book's galley-proofs. Note: An interesting small case of pre-publication revision involving copy-text occurs in the first edition of Fielding's Tom Jones (1749) (" Tom Jones Plus and Minus: Towards a Practical Text," Harvard Library Bulletin , 25 (1977), 101-113). In the third volume, sheet O has been shown by Dr. Hugh Amory to be a cancellans sheet. By an extraordinary accident the unrevised third edition set from the first used as copy a volume with the lost original cancellandum text. The cancellans in the first edition was set from an authorially revised copy of the cancellandum and so is at one remove from the original typesetting. Likewise, the third edition is at one remove, having been set from an unrevised copy of the same sheet. Technically, therefore, both first and third editions have equal authority in the accidentals of the unrevised portions of the text in this sheet. A decision between them needs to be made from partially contradictory evidence. If one compares the number of accidental changes (chiefly punctuation) made unauthoritatively in the adjacent sheets by the third edition setting from first-edition copy, one will observe that these are fewer than the number of differences in sheet O. If the third edition had set the cancellandum sheet with equal fidelity, the extra variants could represent first-edition unauthoritative departures from the same copy or a combination of these with any changes that Fielding may have (undemonstrably) made while he was working over the sheet and giving some of its pages a general revision. In a very small amount of text, however, within a few pages elsewhere in which the first-edition workmen reset Fielding's revised text in separate cancellantia leaves, the reproduction of the accidentals in the reset text from the preserved cancellanda is remarkably faithful. This is the only evidence that exists from which one may gain any notion of the faithfulness of the first edition workmen to their copy, and it is too limited to be of singular service. Balancing the conflicting evidence, therefore, an editor might feel that on the whole there was something to be said for the third edition's version as copy-text for this sheet, regardless of the revised substantives of the first-edition text and the quite unknown and unknowable question of Fielding's alteration of accidentals in unrevised text as he worked over the cancellandum sheet to provide copy for the cancellans found in the first edition. But a third range of evidence casts doubt on this assumption. Although within sheet O the first edition has a few punctuation differences from the third where it is somewhat easier to believe that it is reproducing its copy instead of departing from it (as in neat parenthetical commas found in the third edition but not in the first), various of the third-edition variant punctuation readings in this sheet seem more typical of Fielding than in their first-edition form, at least to the extent that similar forms to the third are found in the adjacent sheets set by the first edition from manuscript. An example would be the use of a colon followed by a capital instead of a semicolon and lower case, or the heavier use of semicolons for commas sometimes in the manner of rhetorical pointing. Unfortunately, however, these seemingly characteristic devices are also found as unauthoritative changes made by the third edition from its first-edition copy in adjacent sheets; hence they have no value as evidence in sheet O and if anything work against the hypothesis that the third edition in its variants in this sheet is reproducing the lost cancellandum copy with superior fidelity. The upshot is that an editor finds he has no trustworthy evidence about the accidentals in either edition although he may have a generalized suspicion of the third's variants; in which case it seems to me he would be better advised to play the odds that Fielding may have made some changes in the accidentals and since the case is otherwise almost completely indifferent to opt for the revised first-edition sheet as copy-text. 49 Pre-publication revision during transmission can affect the choice of copy-text when the option lies, as usually, between a preserved manuscript or typescript and the first edition. (Marked proofs for a book are preserved much less frequently than other antecedent documents, but even unmarked early proofs may be valuable for demonstrating what differences from the setting copy resulted from the transmission.) The authorial revision in some intermediate stage(s) needs then to be reconstructed. In the simplest cases when a manuscript was the printer's copy as in the Hawthorne romances or in Lectures VII and VIII of James's Pragmatism , this may be no more than the reconstruction of the proof-alterations. In more complex cases, as in James's Pluralistic Universe , a lost worked-over professional typescript plus extensive authorial proof-alteration needs reconstruction as well. In post-publication revision, ordinarily only the two printed documents (original and revised) are available, as in Fielding's Tom Jones or Joseph Andrews , Hawthorne's Mosses from an Old Manse , or Lectures I-VI of Pragmatism . Here the problem is to reconstruct the lost authorially prepared printer's copy and to attempt to evaluate the role of subsequent proof-corrections, if any. (Normally these proof-corrections could not be distinguished in the book's text from the marking of printer's copy, of course.) The circumstances will dictate the choice of copy-text. If with Hawthorne's Marble Faun —where bibliographical analysis can distinguish between Hawthorne's proof-correction and the printer's variants for major parts of the first edition—the decision is made that the printer's departures from copy in the accidents completely outweigh the possibility of the author's proof-alterations, the manuscript becomes the copy-text. If with James's Pluralistic Universe the decision is made that James's alterations in the typescript and in the proof are more numerous than the printer's departures from copy not only in respect to the idiosyncratic and hence identifiable accidentals but also to the more neutral forms, the first edition becomes the preferred copy-text over the manuscript. If with Locke's Of Human Understanding the decision is made that Locke not only revised the accidentals as well as the substantives for the second edition but also used this revised text as the physical basis for a further revision of both features by marking copy and reading proofs for the revised fourth, then with Professor Nidditch one would choose this fourth edition instead of the first as copy-text. Note: It is always an individual matter how much the presence of identifiable idiosyncratic accidental revisions may be taken to imply the existence of more indifferent and unassignable alterations. In Sejanus most editors might take it that in marking Q copy the special attention Jonson clearly gave to adding examples of apostrophus, correcting English to classicized spellings when appropriate, and reducing his earlier heavy capitalization system to lower case need not hold equally for his ordinary spellings or the general run of the punctuation save for a few specific categories, generally identifiable, and thus that the punctuational system of Q is probably more authoritative on the whole in its indifferent pointing than that of F, and so with the ordinary spelling. This is because Jonson was intent only on certain theories, not on general improvement of satisfactory results. On the other hand, with William James and probably with most authors (Yeats seems to be an example too), it is a matter of where there is smoke there is fire: once his hand may be detected by idiosyncratic spelling and syntactical changes, the full complement of general improvement in the punctuational system may be expected. The relationship between the qualitative (assignable) and quantitative (indifferent) accidental variants may change not only between authors but according to transmissional agents and their ways. An Elizabethan compositor is more likely to reproduce an author's eccentricities than his conventional forms whereas a more modern compositor may be inclined to reduce the unusual to standard practice and to follow copy more faithfully when the styling is indifferent. As every editor knows, the choice of copy-text is important not only as a means of preserving major authority in the accidents as a whole but also as providing an editor with a working hypothesis to that end when he is faced with transmissional variation whether pre- or post-publication. Greg believed that the pull of the copy-text authority could operate with the substantives as well, and he advised an editor to rely on the copy-text instead of a revised edition in cases where the choice of a substantive reading was perfectly balanced. This is often sage advice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when the incidence of compositorial substantive error is high and any revised edition is likely to be a mixture of wrong and of right readings. 50 It may be less useful later. The emphasis must rest, of course, on the complete neutrality of the readings, making it impossible in the editor's opinion to select one or the other on reasoned critical grounds. In such cases of exact balance Greg's mistrust of Renaissance compositors leads him to favor the original reading. We may suppose he had in mind the hypothesis that the original was presumptively authorial. If one then deliberately chose the indifferent reading of a revised edition, the chance entered that one was rejecting authority for a compositorial misreading or memorial contamination, especially since an apparent motive for authorial revision may seem to be wanting. Since the critical judgment could not affirm the authority of the new reading, it would seem better to stick with the authority one knows than to gamble on the unknown quality of the variant which, moreover, offered little incentive to forsake the comfort of the assumedly authoritative known. This line of reasoning gambles, in effect, that the original reading was not a misprint or corruption and the revised reading an authentic correction, but the reverse. Note: What is an 'exact balance' (in Greg's phrase) between two readings may vary from editorial temperament to editorial temperament, of course, an inevitability that need not interfere with Greg's principle. However, in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare , pp. xxxiii-xxxiv, Greg most acutely illustrates how an editor should exhaust every possibility affecting a decision, for when other grounds may be present (even though conjectural), simple critical judgment is not enough. He mentions the case of an editor taking the Hamlet Second Quarto as copy-text and finding the reading there at I.v.20 "Like Quills upon the fearful porpentine" whereas the Folio reads fretful . If he were puzzled by two such excellent competing readings, Greg suggests that he can find some comfort by considering (a) one or other version is bound to be a misreading, an error, not a revision; (b) "this is one of several variants (common to F and Q1) to which the same explanation might apply, but which are all characterized by a similarity of graphic outline . . . an editor, while basing his text upon the quarto, should nevertheless adopt the folio reading . . . because the quarto is known to be very carelessly printed, so that when it is a case of a simple misprint, the folio, though at least one step further removed from the autograph, may yet be the better authority"; (c) the reading fretful in the bad Q1 establishes the reading of the prompt-book. The coincidence of Q1 and F does not necessarily prove that the prompt-book had not been corrupted (and the error thence passed on to Q1 through the actor's memory and finally to F). Nevertheless, if the question resolves down to an error made in one or other printed text, the establishment through Q1 of the Folio fretful as not a misprint by a compositor who should have set the reading of his copy assists in the conclusion that it was the Q2 compositor who misread his handwritten copy, not the F1 workman. This is not entirely a pure case, of course, because the evidence of Q1 is of considerable importance; nevertheless it suggests a line of thinking that results at least in a working hypothesis instead of a flip of the coin. It must be emphasized that in this matter of advocating the authority of the copy-text for evenly balanced substantive variants Greg was writing theoretically and he offered no illustrations. However, one may speculate that what he actually had in mind was less likely to be examples of linear revised relationship as in Nashe or Jonson but instead the more serious problems found in plays like King Lear where the Folio copy-text readings do not always seem superior to those of the Bad Quarto, and where there are a number of cruxes on which editors divide. Like King Lear Shakespeare's Othello involves transmissional prepublication problems, although of a different sort, that involve scribes as well as compositors, and was probably also in Greg's thought. However, the complexities of bad quarto and 'revised edition' have no relation to modern problems, nor is the Othello situation, or that of 2 Henry IV (as we dimly conceive them) very likely to arise. For any pertinence to other than special Renaissance problems one must confine the case, practically speaking, to linear transmission, either from manuscript or typescript to printed edition or else to an edition revised from the text of an earlier. Under these conditions, the closer one comes to periods where compositorial accuracy improves—especially in the setting from printed copy—the more the authority grows in favor of variants in a revised edition and the more likely it is that an indifferent variant in the revised text is authorial, not compositorial. 51 If so, a very real question arises whether Greg's advice is a good editorial principle to adopt under changed conditions from those of Renaissance compositorial and scribal free-wheeling. Evidence for either position is hard to find that can be called demonstrable, for if the answer is known between two seemingly balanced variants then they are no longer truly balanced and the case becomes hypothetical. For instance, since neither occurs in his holograph papers it would take the evidence of a computer concordance of Fielding to learn whether in Joseph Andrews Fanny had more likely 'laid hold on the Girdle which her Lover wore for that purpose' (273.13-14) or, as the revised third edition has it, laid hold of ; or whether between the first and third editions Fielding had come to feel that 'was the Subject of your Contention anywise material' had better be changed to anyways (and then in the fifth edition to any ways ). Ultimately these difficult decisions involving idiom may come to be less conjecturally based than what songs the sirens sang; 52 but more certainty is possible in other matters that might at first sight appear to be equally balanced. For example, beginning with this revised third edition a number of alterations affecting small irregularities of modification and coherence are improved, such as 48.21 first edition 'She was a poor Girl, who had formerly been bred up in Sir John's Family' altered in the third to been formerly bred up , a change seemingly of some indifference and possible as the compositor's memorial failure. A more obvious example of the same is the original 'whom he observed not to be fallen into the most compassionate Hands' (61.25-26) which appears in the third edition as to be fallen not into ; or 'If it was only our present Business to make Similies' (45.30) altered in the third to was our present Business only to make . If an editor stuck to the copy-text in such readings, taking it that the third-edition order resulted from memorial failure or a purist compositor intent on making the style more formal, he would quite definitely be wrong, for (a) the third edition exhibits half a dozen more cases scattered sufficiently to make it unlikely that all were the doing of one compositor, 53 (b) similar improvements are made in the fourth and even in the revised fifth edition, (c) the identical kind of alteration is a feature of the revised fourth edition of Tom Jones . Contiguity may play a part in the evidence an editor seeks, for in a revised edition it may seem more likely that a cluster of variants results from authorial marking than from a sudden spate of compositorial error. For instance, in Joseph Andrews 57.8-18 the text of the first two editions reads: Tow-wouse , (who notwithstanding his Charity, would have given his Vote as freely as he ever did at an Election, that any other House in the Kingdom, should have had quiet Possession of his Guest) answered, 'My Dear, I am not to blame: he was brought hither by the Stage-Coach; and Betty had put him to bed before I was stirring.' 'I'll Betty her,' says she—At which, with half her Garments on, the other half under her Arm, she sallied out in quest of the unfortunate Betty , whilst Tow-wouse and the Surgeon went to pay a Visit to poor Joseph , and enquire into the Circumstance of this melancholy Affair. In the revised third edition three substantive variants occur: ever he for he ever , should have for should have had , and Circumstances for Circumstance . Each one of these seems about evenly balanced but their clustering pyramids the advisability of adopting the third-edition readings as authorial alterations. An author's special revisory interests will sometimes indicate that one or other of a choice—revised edition or original copy-text—is the more authoritative. Fielding's concern for clarifying his modification was only one of his interests in revising both Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones . Another was to weed out certain old-fashioned usages in the preterites of verbs, like altering bid to bad (five times) and begun to began . This is also a feature of the revision of Tom Jones in the fourth edition, in which tore is changed to torn , bore to borne , and begun to began (four times). 54 Other concerns manifest themselves in revisions. In Tom Jones the first-edition copy-text reads, 'yet so discreet was she in her Conduct, that her Prudence was as much on the Guard, as if she had had all the Snares to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole Sex' (36.9-37.2). This seems unexceptionable, and the revised fourth edition's if she had all could easily be an eyeskip. An editor might be tempted to retain the copy-text unless he had observed that the fourth edition alters had had to had nine additional times: clearly Fielding was making a special revision throughout the novel. On the other hand, when in Joseph Andrews or Tom Jones the revised editions slip and substitute has for hath , or does for doth , an editor may safely retain the copy-text, there being dozens of examples in the two novels of Fielding's revision to his preferred forms hath and doth . Not only substantives but forms of words ordinarily classed among the accidentals but better listed as semi-substantives because of their linguistic interest may offer serious problems because they are as subject to compositorial as to authorial modernization. In Tom Jones whether the first edition Recipe or the revised fourth's Receipt is authorial cannot be known in the absence of the word in preserved holographs. In the fourth edition Fielding seems to have been concerned to alter older and ambiguous forms to modern, as in Council to Counsel , and errant to arrant (see the textual notes to 111.39 and 190.15 on p. 1014), although he missed wave for waive (212.2). This being so, the question arises whether the invariable change (except for its single use as a name) of Ostler to Hostler in the fourth edition is compositorial. In earlier works the word had been printed as Hostler , but it is hard to believe that the workmen setting the first edition in different places altered manuscript Hostler to Ostler . Since there seems some reason to conjecture that Ostler was what appeared in the manuscript, it is difficult to know whether the fourth edition's changes represent Fielding's or the compositors' modernization, and the same for the change from hollowing to hallowing some half dozen times, especially since hollowing is the form printed in Fielding's earlier works. A conservative editor may prefer to stay with his copy-text, a more adventurous one to suspect that Fielding may have been the modernizer. In any large work like Tom Jones or even Joseph Andrews , intermediate between Elizabethan and modern printing, small verbal differences will of course occur that seem to be perfectly balanced especially when the differences are slight. An example might be cited in Joseph Andrews (27.25-26) where the first-edition copy-text reads, 'She plainly saw the Effects which Town-Air hath on the soberest Constitutions' but in the revised second edition the Town-Air , an easy printer's sophistication but a possible authorial correction or revision. In Tom Jones the ubiquitous problem of these and those rears its ugly head, as at 54.32, 74.28, 385.10, etc., variants that seem paralleled by Joseph Andrews 242.2, which may or may not support the otherwise more doubtful variant in the same work at 126.12. It is particularly difficult to attack such problems, often of misreading, when the compositors cannot be identified. A misreading problem in which one word is very likely right and the other wrong is posed in Joseph Andrews when the captain pulled the chair from under Parson Adams as he was sitting down, so that 'he fell down on the Ground; and thus [or this as in 4-5 ] completed Joke the first, to the great Entertainment of the whole Company' (245.37). Perhaps in the category of Fanny's having laid hold on or of Joseph's girdle but slightly more possible as an authorial revision is the question whether Lady Booby's soul was 'tossed up and down by [ or with in 5 ] turbulent and opposite Passions' (287.6). When choices of reading involve such exquisite factors, and the problems of compositorial misreading or memorial corruption in original or revised edition are complicated by the possibility of finicky authorial revision, the presumption of error in the reading of the revised edition that led Greg to suggest the advisability of retaining the copy-text is not quite so firm even though it may sometimes be operative. The differences may be observed in the Wesleyan-Clarendon editions of Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones . For the first, in my role as textual consultant I recognized that each edition through the fifth had been revised—not in any sense thoroughly but by a polishing and refinement of the language and syntax not always in a conspicuous manner—yet it also seemed clear that the fidelity of the compositors was suspect beginning with the third edition, the doubt increasing as the identifiable authorial revision dwindled in the fourth and fifth editions. This uneasiness about the authority of various small changes, combined with the powerful influence Greg's precept about indifferent choices then exercised on my thinking, led me to suggest the advisability of marked caution in the acceptance of minor differences in the revised editions, advice that I now see led to too many retentions of copy-text authority and too few inclusions of neutral-seeming revisions. Later, doing the Tom Jones text from scratch as my own responsibility, I conceived a higher opinion of the fourth edition's faithfulness to copy despite a number of small lapses by its workmen, and a lower opinion of the value of Greg's advice in periods later than the Renaissance, especially as applied to linear revised editions set with greater general accuracy than is expected in Elizabethan reprints. As a result, in Tom Jones proportionally far more indifferent variants are inserted from the revised edition into the first-edition copy-text than in the conservatively treated Joseph Andrews , although still perhaps not quite enough (because it is difficult not to suspect small idiomatic changes in a revision). In short, eighteenth-century are not Elizabethan compositors; and from this experience I conceived a distrust under some circumstances for the general principle of retaining the copy-text reading in cases of balanced variants. In later periods it is even possible that the advice is dangerous since it may foster an attitude too conservative for the changed conditions. When a modern author gives evidence in his revision that he has been concerned with small things as well as great, I now believe that an editor is better advised to give the benefit of the doubt to the readings of the revised edition provided he has some reasonable faith in the general fidelity of its compositors to copy 55 and believes that the author was capable of making the changes in question. On the whole, this applies to accidentals as well as to substantives and hence may lead to a selection of the revised edition as copy-text, in which case an editor may return to Greg's conservatism but in the reverse direction. In the Elizabethan period the nature and extent of authorial revision is sometimes in doubt, and variation between editions representing some authority (as possibly in Hamlet or Othello ) may arise not from authorial intervention at some stage but from different textual traditions complicated by scribal transcripts (and in the drama by theatrical tinkering). Under such circumstances one needs to be conservative and to require a possible 'revision' (especially arising in prepublication transmission) to cross the balance line before a supposedly authoritative original is to be altered—like fretful for fearful porpentine . But the climate of opinion changes with post-publication authorial revision of an earlier print. Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones in the mid-eighteenth century offer a halfway house for the work of a practising author in ordinary conditions whose copy was transmitted by compositors still subject to the faults inherent in hand setting. (Alexander Pope's careful attention to his revised texts in preparation and in proof is quite another matter, just as Walt Whitman is another matter.) By the time one reaches the nineteenth century, although still in the period of hand setting with its greater opportunities for compositorial sophistication, the accuracy in following copy increases for the substantives and with it the odds that these variants in a revised edition are the more likely to be authorial in an overwhelming majority of cases. In Hawthorne's Twice-Told Tales , for instance, in "The Gray Champion" seven authorial substantive revisions appear to have been made in the 1837 collection from the periodical copy but no other variants, and the tale was reprinted in three other editions to 1853 without further substantive difference. In "The Minister's Black Veil" the only unauthorial substantive variants are two that crept into the fourth-edition reprint; in "The May-Pole of Merry Mount" seven substantive revisions appear in 1837 as against one misprint; in "Mr. Higginbotham's Catastrophe" Hawthorne made twenty-nine revisions in 1837 although here an estimated four printer's errors appear simultaneously; in "The Great Carbuncle" five revisions appear but no unauthorial substantive changes in 1837 (four occur in the unrevised third edition of 1851), and so on. By the time one reaches William James, no more than one or two unauthoritative substantive variants (if that) are likely to appear in any one of his collections revised from journal articles, although there is a good possibility that in the revised The Will to Believe (1897) it was the printer who was responsible for the consistent change of amongst to among . In fact, it is not until one encounters a textual situation as in James's The Meaning of Truth in which the revised edition is itself the copytext that Greg's advice, paradoxically, proves to be sound for modern literature, since the cases are few in a carefully proofread book like this where the substantives of the text (and not just some accidentals) may need correction by reference to an earlier authority. However, the scrupulousness of a James does not seem to be required to reverse Greg's principle for any period after the Renaissance—and it may be that even in this period the application needs more testing with the readings of authorially revised linear editions. One may flip a coin or for lack of a better reason adhere to the copy-text with a complicated textual situation like that in Othello , or King Lear , 56 but for normal conditions when in genuine doubt the odds may be taken to favor the in-line revision over the reading of the earlier copy-text. The wheel comes full circle, of course, when the revised edition is the copy-text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Greg's paper was solicited for a bibliographical section in the 1949 English Institute meetings in New York City, was read in absentia on September 8, and printed in Studies in Bibliography , 3 (1950-51), 19-36. It was reprinted, with a few minor changes, in The Collected Papers of Sir Walter Greg , ed. J. C. Maxwell (Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1966), pp. 374-391. Quotations are taken from this latter source. 2 A dissenter is John M. Robson, who in 1966 gave a reasoned defence of a choice of the final edition as copy-text for the Toronto edition of John Stuart Mill: see "Principles and Methods in the Collected Edition of John Stuart Mill," Editing Nineteenth Century Texts , ed. J. M. Robson (University of Toronto Press, 1967), pp. 96-122. If I follow correctly the implications of the argument, the grounds for Dr. Robson's disagreement are as much ideological as practical, and—although the comparison is not elaborated—rest on "the differences between printing and publishing practices in the Renaissance on the one hand, and the nineteenth century on the other, [which] suggest a proper divergence in editing procedures, a divergence as justified as that between procedures in editing classical and Renaissance texts" (p. 114). This is a question I propose to discuss. Greg's rationale has not found favor on the European continent. The Soviet Russian textologists seem to be most advanced in the acceptance of the function of editorial judgment acting within the analysis of textual transmission; but it is unclear what their practising attitude is to the matter of accidentals in relation to the rationale's precepts, and thus their acceptance of critical editing procedures appears to be confined to the second half of Greg's propositions without taking in the first. Otherwise, it would seem that the German school, basically one of variorum editing, rules. The best statement in English of this European editorial theory and practice may be found in Hans Zeller, "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," Studies in Bibliography , 28 (1975), 231-264. 3 Warner Barnes, "Nineteenth-Century Editorial Problems: A Selective Bibliography," op. cit. , ed. Robson, p. 129. Barnes does not specify, but the views would need to comprise (a) the choice of copy-text on the basis of the authority of its accidentals, not that of the substantives, and (b) in a critical edition the necessity for the editor to exercise his judgment in the selection of substantive readings from more than one authoritative document, not necessarily the copy-text. 4 In his excellent general survey, combining theory and practice, which should be obligatory reading for all students, G. Thomas Tanselle argues that at least implicitly Greg was aware that his rationale was applicable to literature later than that of the Renaissance: "can Greg's rationale be applied to the products which emerged from the very different publishing circumstances of later periods? Greg's own answer to these questions, I think it can be plainly inferred from his essay, would be Yes," "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," Studies in Bibliography , 28 (1975), 181. The point is not an important one, but some clarification may be useful. My personal acquaintance with Sir Walter Greg would lead me to believe that in this essay, as in all his work, he was cautious about asserting that his concepts were applicable to a wider field of evidence than that in which he chose to set them. The reader might endeavor to extrapolate them to test their broader efficacy, but Greg would have hesitated to suggest in any manner that this was his own intention or even wish. I suppose that knowing he was on firm ground in the period of his experience, he disliked to introduce the possibility that doubt might arise about his position if a reader began to make exceptions suggested by his special knowledge of other fields. Obviously, a reader sympathetic with Greg's position has a duty to test it in circumstances not envisaged in the essay; but Greg's personal attitude, I venture to say, would have been that he does so at his own risk. In my view, Dr. Tanselle's evidence for his suggestion that Greg was thinking in broader terms than the set of conditions he was illustrating from the Renaissance is based on a misinterpretation. For instance, one piece of evidence brought forward of Greg's reference to scribes and compositors (p. 181) does indeed suggest, as he asserts, that Greg took it that human beings react similarly whether copying by hand or setting type. But Greg was thinking quite plainly of medieval and Renaissance scribes, and of Renaissance compositors setting by hand. He would have distrusted the application of this generalization, in as precise a way as he had utilized it, to a period, say, of typist copying or linotype setting. The different conditions produce in many respects different kinds and possibly different quantities of error. Other indications that Dr. Tanselle finds of Greg's broader implicit purpose are true enough if one recognizes that Greg is looking back to medieval manuscript texts, many of whose problems are applicable to the scribal copy behind Elizabethan books and present in a few respects relatively close analogies with the hand-setting of type in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thus, when Greg refers to another period than his own, he deliberately looks back, and not forward as has been suggested. 5 Misunderstandings leading to adverse criticism of Greg's position are perhaps even more common than doctrinaire rigidity in its application. Tanselle (p. 197 and note) remarks that "one cannot help regarding many of the recent discussions (both favorable and unfavorable) . . . as naïve and parochial, and frequently as uninformed or misinformed." For examples, see p. 201 ff., principally pp. 203-204, 207-219. 6 See my "Current Theories of Copy-Text, with an Illustration from Dryden," "Multiple Authority: New Concepts of Copy-Texts," and "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," collected in Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (University Press of Virginia, 1975); also, "Textual Criticism," in The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in the Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. J. Thorpe (MLA, rev. ed., 1970), pp. 29-54. The textual introductions in a number of editions approved by the Center for Editions of American Authors (now the Center for Scholarly Editions) have made valuable contributions. Dr. Tanselle's important survey article has already been mentioned and the various references in his footnotes offer a useful conspectus of the numerous discussions not mentioned here. 7 Briefly, although certain syntactical punctuation like a period to end a sentence was recognized, in general the punctuation marks indicate not syntactical units and relationships, as in the present day, but instead a graduated series of pauses rising in weight from comma to semicolon to colon. The present distinctive use of the colon versus semicolon was unknown, and it is highly doubtful that the principle of restriction and nonrestriction was present in anyone's mind for phrases and clauses, apart from pauses: it certainly did not govern the presence or absence of punctuation. The loose Elizabethan syntax and its punctuation work together very smoothly once one becomes accustomed to its flexibility and occasional uncalculated ambiguities. Editors of modernized texts have difficulty fitting the sprawling syntax into neat modern units of syntactical punctuation and find themselves forced into an excessive use of dashes, or into J. Dover Wilson's idiosyncratic use of a series of dots. 8 Although critics loosely talk about house rules in the Elizabethan printing shop, little evidence exists to support their position. Personal example, and the master-apprentice system, might encourage some degree of uniformity in the treatment of certain accidentals: thus there is evidence that Jaggard's apprentice Compositor E rather quickly acquired many of the prominent characteristics of the shop's premier Compositor B. Nevertheless, the spelling of the First Folio is so individualistic that the exact pages set by each of six compositors can be established on the evidence of their spelling habits, combined with a few idiosyncratic typographical conventions. Hence some compositors could be called more 'modern' than others within the same shop. It follows that at least certain accidental characteristics of any printed book would vary according to the compositor who set the pages, and uniformity of accidental texture within any book is ordinarily non-existent. There was so little house style in Jaggard's shop, even in matters outside of spelling, that no fixed system was enforced in the First Folio about the italicizing or non-italicizing of the names of countries and cities, or of territorial titles. Even simple typographical mechanics were not standardized, as witness Compositor C's habit of setting a space before a comma in certain circumstances. 9 The printer's housestyling of books in the nineteenth and the publisher's styling as the twentieth century wears on might in some sense impose uniformity of system on an unsystematic author; but this is seldom referable to the spelling, for example, since in most respects general standards of acceptability had been established and the stylization of spelling is largely (although not entirely) a question of the correction of error, with some occasional standardization in the United States according to Webster's . Light or heavy punctuation systems and matters of word-division will bulk larger in the styling of accidental changes, whereas in Shakespeare's day the problems of recovering authorial spelling for its intrinsic interest and as a guide to emendation has proved to be of more concern than ordinary questions of authorial punctuation. For a recent study of the statements in nineteenth-century printers' manuals about the following of copy, see John Bush Jones, "Victorian 'Readers' and Modern Editors: Attitudes and Accidentals Revisited," PBSA , 71 (1977), 47-59. On p. 58 the conclusion is drawn: "Granted the dominant view was that accidentals were the printer's particular concern, nevertheless as early as 1808 Nightingale was advocating at least limited querying rather than arbitrary correction, and after mid-century there was an unsteady but visible progression of opinion toward preserving authorial accidentals." On p. 59 the important distinction is made: "the fact (according to De Vinne) that house styling of accidentals took precedence over authorial intentions in late nineteenth-century periodicals raises doubts about their reliability as copy texts for short works and serialized novels first published in magazines." I have observed this distinction to hold in the essays that William James published in popular magazines like McClure's in the early twentieth century but not in general in the learned journals where his work first appeared. 10 Since Greg's day the science (or art) of identifying compositors by their spelling and sometimes by certain mechanical characteristics has advanced rapidly. But the further step of identifying the underlying characteristics of the copy is still awaiting more information. When no sample of autograph manuscript is preserved, to identify an early author's variable accidentals as distinct from the compositor's is conjectural at best. 11 As, for instance, in the mainly collateral texts of such plays as Hamlet , Othello , and Troilus and Cressida , in which two different authorities are represented by the early Quarto and the later Folio texts. Regardless of the substantives, an editor will choose the Quartos as copy-text because the accidentals reflect a texture more nearly contemporary with Shakespeare whereas the Folio's texture is posthumous and modernized. (This is to ignore other considerations such as the physically derived nature of the Folio from the Quarto texts owing to the use as Folio printer's copy of a Quarto brought into general conformity with a second authority by scribal annotation.) The question of these collateral texts will be discussed later, as well as the somewhat confusing use that Greg makes of 'bad quartos' as illustration of revised texts. At the present, however, it may clarify matters to point to Greg's speculation (p. 381) about McKerrow's position if he had lived to apply the Prolegomena form of his editorial theory to plays with more than one authoritative text "as in Hamlet and perhaps in 2 Henry IV, Troilus and Cressida , and Othello ." What Greg has in mind here is the uncertainties of his own day about the authority of the variant texts of 2 Henry IV, Troilus , and Othello as against the then certainty that the Folio version of Hamlet represented a substantially different authorial text from that of the Second Quarto. At the present time scholars are inclined to believe that, perhaps even more than in Hamlet , the texts of Quarto and Folio Othello possibly, and certainly of Troilus , are different in their origin more by reason of the author than of the conditions of transmission, with QF 2 Henry IV considerably more in doubt as of true independent authority. However, Greg does not have in mind in his distinction the bibliographical question whether, in using an annotated quarto as printer's copy, the Folio text can properly be called 'substantive' in a pure sense in comparison with a play that exhibits no physical derivation. Here only 2 Henry IV among Shakespeare's non-bad quarto texts is any longer seriously in question whether the Folio was set from manuscript or from a marked-up quarto. It must be admitted, however, that although 'bibliographical links' establish the derivation from the Quarto of the Folio texts of Troilus and of Othello , these links have not been so firmly demonstrated in Hamlet . Hence at least in theory the anomalies produced by the Folio reproduction of the Hamlet Second Quarto's substantive errors are susceptible of conjecture that they derive from some common lost manuscript. If the Second Quarto were indeed set from Shakespeare's working papers (for which again there is only a belief based on the unusual spelling and the apparent difficulties in legibility of the manuscript), then the notion of the derivation of common error is more difficult to maintain, for it would require the scribe making the copy that ultimately produced the Folio to have mistaken various words in the identical manner as did the compositor of the Second Quarto—more of a possibility than a probability. 12 Renaissance scholars always have in mind the possibility if not the probability that a scribal transcript may intervene between the holograph and the printed book, and sometimes more than one. Hence among the problems in assessing the accidental authority of an early printed text is that of the difficulty of finding evidence as to whether the printer's copy was a holograph or a derived scribal manuscript. A late nineteenth-century parallel would be the question of setting from holograph or from professionally made typescript; in the twentieth century the question may arise whether a book were set from an authorial typescript or from a professional one ordered by the author's agent and very likely never looked over by the author before type was set from it. It is true that some international publishing conditions may in later times reproduce a few of the problems of early collateral manuscript texts, as in the quadruple transmission of Stephen Crane's "Death and the Child" without authorial revision accounting for this multiplicity of documents. But the special medieval conditions of copies being made from other copies at different removes is not present. 13 The use of the word reprint in Greg's essay is subject to some possible confusion. In a strictly textual sense it means a resetting of an earlier printed edition that has not been subject to authorial correction or revision and hence is completely unauthoritative in every respect. In a looser sense it is often employed to mean any edition reset from another, whether or not the author or some other agent had altered the copy from which the later edition was typeset or had similarly intervened during the course of printing as by proof-correction. The modern reader must be on the lookout for the different shades of technical meaning in writings on textual matters. In hand printing a reprint normally implies a resetting of the type; but the word is also used (instead of reimpression) for the rare cases of another printing from standing type, corresponding in modern terms to the 'reprinting' of a book from the same plates. The confusion derives from the fact that in one sense reprint is a textual word with certain important critical implications; in the other it is a mechanical term for the printing process. A purist would confine reprint to the first and reimpression to the second; but many textual critics employ the term in its mixed or general sense, trusting to the context to prevent misunderstanding. Greg's objection on p. 379, note 1, to McKerrow's very loose use of reprint to describe a modern old-spelling edition based on an early copy-text is not nitpicking, for McKerrow's choice of the term is in fact misleading for anything other than a diplomatic reprint, or transcript, of some early authority. Greg usefully writes 'revised reprint' for a reset edition modified by the author or by reference to some other authority. 14 The parenthesis refers exclusively to reported texts, or 'bad quartos,' which are memorial reconstructions by some agent(s) other than the author and hence break the transcriptional link with a holograph since their accidentals can have no relation to those of the original text being memorially reproduced. 15 This is the conventional method in all ages for authorial revision. In the seventeenth century John Dryden marked up a copy of the first edition of The Indian Emperour to serve as printer's copy for the revised second, and he did the same with the second edition to produce setting copy for the revised third. Henry Fielding not quite a hundred years later annotated a copy of the third edition of Tom Jones to provide the printer's copy for the only revised edition, the fourth. William James in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries customarily annotated pages from his periodical articles when he reprinted them in revised form in a book collection. I do not know of examples, but I can imagine that at the present day if the authorial annotations were very copious and difficult to read, to spare expense in the printing some publishers (or agents) might make up a typescript of the authorially marked printed copy for the printer's convenience. Especially if the author were not informed of this fact (as is probable he would not be) and so could not recollate the entire typescript text, not just his annotations, typist variations could enter the transmission indistinguishable from printer's variants not caught and altered in proof unless the typescript (and original copy) were preserved as evidence for future generations of textual scholars. There is an unsubstantiated rumor that for at least one or two plays in an early volume of the Cambridge University Press's critical edition of Beaumont and Fletcher's dramatic canon (1966—), the Press made such a typescript from the difficult marked-up xeroxes of the original copy-texts although, if so, the editors were given back only the xeroxes for proofreading copy. 16 Actually, within this group the technical authority is by no means comparable in anything but a general sense. How much of the differences between the Quarto and Folio texts of 2 Henry IV stem from the scribe who copied the manuscript behind the Folio text is unknown; indeed, the whole lost history of the transmission of these texts before print is highly conjectural. Although the Second Quarto text of Hamlet may have been set from Shakespeare's own working papers, it seems clear that the Folio version derives from a prompt-book that from time to time had been adjusted for performance and may not even be the original book; hence in practical terms few modern editors have taken the Folio Hamlet as literally of comparable authority with the Quarto for the generality of its readings. There is some chance, however, that the two versions of Troilus have an immediate or very close relationship to Shakespeare and in the technical sense are comparable for their substantives. Even if one stemmed from a fair scribal copy and the other from Shakespeare's own papers, I fancy the overall authority is little disturbed, no matter how one might view the formal details of the scribal copy, principally because the odds seem very good that an original and a revised Shakespearean document lie behind the two forms. My intentionally neutral statement that the author 'was equally concerned in the composition of both versions' would also cover the case of Othello (albeit in a quite different sense) if Greg is correct (and not Walker) in his estimate that Quarto and Folio each derives from the versions produced by two scribes copying the same Shakespearean manuscript for different purposes. 17 For an extended analysis of McKerrow's definition of 'substantive' edition and of Greg's subsequent expansion of this term to include mixed texts like Richard III, Troilus , or Jonson's Catiline , whether resulting from scribal conflation with another authority or from authorial revision, see my "McKerrow, Greg, and 'Substantive Edition,'" forthcoming in The Library . The problem in the "Rationale" resulted from Greg's abandonment of his position about mixed texts as held in the Editorial Problem and his return to McKerrow's narrow definition. However, two particular remarks in the "Rationale" can be interpreted only in terms of his original acceptance of mixed texts as substantive and so suggest either incompletely digested revision of his essay or else an inadvertent anachronism in his thinking. It may be remarked that in 1942 Greg believed that the Folio Hamlet and Othello were printed from independent manuscripts, not from annotated quartos ( Editorial Problem , pp. 64, 108). In his Preface to the second edition in 1951 he acknowledged the scholarship that had shown Othello and confirmed Troilus as set from quartos but he allowed his earlier statements about Hamlet to stand. 18 The shift might be confusing to a reader intent on following every point in the argument. In practical terms whether an edition is substantive or not, in McKerrow's sense, is of some editorial importance. If two editions are printed from different manuscripts, concurrence of readings is generally good evidence for their authority (barring common error transmitted from some antecedent document), whereas if two editions are bibliographically linked this concurrence might mean only a printing error in the first passed on to the second by scribal oversight, as is usually supposed to have happened with good kissing carrion and pious bonds (or bands ) in Hamlet Q2 and F1. 19 At this time, especially, printers much preferred even heavily annotated printed copy to manuscripts as setting copy. In my own view, not all of the annotated copy was necessarily furnished Jaggard by the Folio editors: it is just as possible in cases when the company had provided some manuscript other than the prompt-book (not allowed from their possession) that Jaggard himself had an available quarto annotated by reference to the manuscript for the convenience of his compositors. If a prompt-book had been the only manuscript, the theatrical company would necessarily have been responsible for the marked-up printer's copy that had been conflated with it. 20 The only question (which Greg does not mention) might be the practicability of retaining a bad quarto's accidentals as more representative of an Elizabethan author's period than, say, a good text printed much later which modernized the formal features of some now lost early document. But the chances for such occurrences are so limited as to be ignored. In the Cambridge edition of Marlowe, it seemed pedantic to attempt to restore the bad quarto's first-edition accidentals in the text of Doctor Faustus for those portions of the later good quarto based on the annotated third edition of the bad. In order to avoid a top-heavy apparatus of emendation, convenience suggested the propriety (since in neither case was there evidence for accidental authority) of using the later good edition as copy-text. Interestingly, on page 111 of Prolegomena McKerrow discusses the possibility of using the accidentals of the bad Q1 Richard III and decides that it was mainly convenience that dictated his choice of the derived Folio as copy-text instead. 21 Actually convenience cannot be ignored when the choice seems relatively indifferent because of one's ignorance. In both Beggars Bush and The Woman's Prize the manuscript behind the 1647 Folio seems to be closer in text to the authors' working papers but the printing was about fifteen to twenty years later than the inscription of the preserved manuscript. Nevertheless, the punctuation of the manuscripts would have called for an extensive apparatus of emendation had they been selected as copy-text. The difference in formal features did not seem sufficient to justify the considerable reworking of the accidentals that would have been necessary in a critical edition, especially since it was possible that the system of the Folio, being set from an older manuscript than the scribal transcripts, might still be closer to the authors. When nothing is known of an author's accidentals, a practising editor (as distinguished from a textual theorist) is likely to have some sympathy with Greg's remarks about expediency. 22 In his general account (IX, 72) Simpson also remarks on the fact that the press-corrections are heavier in the older works and drop off markedly in the newer, which he takes to be an indication that Jonson was bringing these older plays up to date. One may comment that if Jonson had indeed read pre-printing proofs, this disparity need not have existed since then his in-press alterations should have shown light polishing and second thoughts plus the correction of compositorial failure to follow copy. Instead, the evidence suggests the serious correction and revision at the press that is to be expected if these were the only proofs he saw. The disparity in press-correction between the older and newer plays also has another implication in that it automatically reduces assumptions about the amount of compositorial transmissional error corrected in press and increases the amount of Jonson's independent revision to be found in the press-variants in the older plays. In turn this suggests that the original marking of setting copy may have been less extensive than usually thought in respect to the kind of details represented by his press-corrections since these would mainly be new changes. 23 The closest parallels I can think of concern the relation between a preserved early draft manuscript or typescript like Stephen Crane's "A Detail" or "The Octopush" and the completely rewritten revision that was subsequently published from a now lost quite different copy. Even the William James manuscripts that must yield as copy-texts to his greatly worked-over book publications are not this distant from the revised form: the choice of James's books as copy-texts is made for other reasons than those that affect Every Man in his Humour . 24 This is a confusing footnote at best since it seems to use Greg's discarded expansion and not McKerrow's strict bibliographical definition of 'substantive edition.' Technically, the Shakespearean bad quartos that represent two substantive editions in the bad and good texts according to McKerrow's standard would be like The Merry Wives of Windsor where the bad quarto was not utilized as copy for the good Folio text. (Q1 and Q2 Hamlet , in my opinion, would also be substantive in this sense.) Plays like Richard III offer a paradox. Technically according to the "Rationale" the bad quarto (Q1) is the substantive edition since it alone was printed without reference to any other edition, and the Folio is a derived edition since its printer's copy was contrived by annotating a copy of the Quarto (Q3) with readings from a good manuscript. But to be technical in this matter is to be ridiculous textually, and other terms must be sought. It would have been helpful if Greg had not blurred the distinction between the two kinds of bad quartos, for this distinction powerfully affects his definition of the corresponding good texts. 25 Among other important differences, the accidentals of the earlier edition have no authority and the bad quarto would not be an acceptable copy-text even if it were practicable to introduce into its accidental texture the good substantive readings (and their accompanying accidentals) from the Folio. Moreover, when as is inevitable the Folio of Richard III is taken as copy-text, no one but a variorum editor would dream of recording the Bad Quarto's variant accidentals as Simpson felt obliged to do for the Quarto (and later editions) when he selected the 1616 Folio as copy-text for Sejanus . 26 The only question (which Greg does not mention) might be the practicability of retaining the bad quarto's accidentals as more representative of an Elizabethan author's period than, say, a good text printed in the eighteenth century with the texture of that period. But the chances of such occurrences are so limited as to be ignored. The First Folio's accidentals, although 'modernized' from copy, are not so vitally different from those of earlier quartos as to be anachronistic to a serious degree. 27 When in the manuscript of The Marble Faun Hawthorne was endeavoring to spell in the English manner for the English publishers of the first edition, he nevertheless retained neighbor as an -or spelling. William James is an -or speller but he invariably writes colour and usually honour . Hawthorne's attempts to style his manuscript in the British manner led him to adopt some -our spellings that were not acceptable by English standards of the day. Having chosen the manuscript as copy-text in the Centenary Edition of this romance, I felt that to alter Hawthorne's uncharacteristic but self-imposed -our to the American -or he used in other works (or even to the current British standards) would have been essentially to modernize the text. This is a different matter from my editorial position that British forms in William James's articles printed in English journals should be Americanized to his standard manuscript practice, observable in those preserved manuscripts underlying the British prints. Naturally, when James revised such articles for American book collection, he or the compositors gave them the normal American spellings in the editions that have been chosen as copy-texts. Thus the two principles are quite different and do not apply to each other even when James's British periodical articles might become the copy-text in default of other more authoritative documents. 28 This is less open-ended than it sounds because in this period (with authors like Jonson something of an exception) one can usually never satisfy oneself that such spellings are not authorial: ordinarily Elizabethan works are edited with no authorial manuscripts preserved to indicate what the author's accidentals were like. Moreover, given the variation in spelling the same word customary in most authors (and many scribes), to decide whether or not some word is authoritatively spelled requires more confidence in normality than most Elizabethan editors would wish to assume. The practical upshot is that the more eccentric the spelling, the more likely an editor is to impute it to the author. 29 Always granting that in early authors they usually cannot be distinguished from compositorial or scribal spellings and that the preservation of authorial characteristics in early literature is likely to be less than in later, much depending, however, on the care with which a later writer marks copy and reads proof. 30 In a far cry from the attitude of the editor of modern literature toward the importance of copy-text to the presentation of an author, Greg writes (p. 384), "The thesis I am arguing is that the historical circumstances of the English language make it necessary to adopt in formal matters [i.e. accidentals] the guidance of some early text." 31 Although Greg would not necessarily have wished to confine this statement to substantives, the context makes it clear that he is thinking only of substantives when he writes 'original reading' and that his chief concern in this passage is to defend the rights of an editor to choose substantive variants from authoritative editions other than the copy-text. How much he would have defended the same rights as applied to accidentals is problematic. In the "Rationale," at least, he does not remark on the anomaly that Herford-Simpson in Sejanus (F being the copy-text) add certain cases of apostrophus from Q which F had dropped but do not emend, according to the same principles, when F normalizes the Q classicizing spellings with one hand while adding a few with the other. Nor does he comment on the tyranny of the copy-text that persuaded the editors to retain what appear to be F corruptions of Q's use of apostrophus, as in He's for Q He'is . Rightly or wrongly, the general impression one is likely to receive from the "Rationale" is a concentration on editorial freedom to deal with variant substantives but little recognition of the comparable opportunities that exist with accidentals. 32 Especially when a reprint is line for line with its copy, considerable mechanical advantage accrues in hand setting to follow the accidentals of the original in order to speed justification of the line. I am no historian of publishing practices and have no idea when the modern custom of a publisher styling the manuscript, to be followed exactly by the printer, revolutionized the older system. What I know from observation is that Hawthorne's manuscripts in the 185os were not at all marked by Tichnor and Fields but were heavily styled at the Riverside Press, several thousand accidental variants from the manuscript press copy appearing in each first edition. (There is also some question whether Tichnor and Fields ever assisted Hawthorne in reading proof for these romances.) The Marble Faun manuscript was not marked, either, by Smith, Elder, its British publisher. In the first decade of the twentieth century Longmans, Green never attempted to style William James's manuscripts or typescripts: James dealt directly with the Riverside Press for each step of the books' production. Whether it was the passage of fifty years or the difference between a fiction writer and a philosopher, in contrast to Hawthorne the Riverside Press set James's copy with considerable fidelity. A test case is his posthumous Some Problems in Philosophy in which his customary heavy proof-correction is not present to interfere with the evidence. The Riverside Press departed from the typescript copy furnished it by Horace Kallen in only about one accidental for every five or so printed pages. In PBSA , 71 (1977), 59 (see fn. 9 above), Bush detects a movement from the mid-eighteenth century toward the substitution of copyreading for the proofreader's correction of authorial accidentals; but he remarks "How widespread this reader's function was is impossible to say," and the references he cites are few and rather vague. 33 Here the evidence of Some Problems of Philosophy is very useful, indeed, in giving us an insight into the fidelity of setting his works customary at the Riverside Press. In James's Psychology (1890) the Holt printer's fidelity in close to verbatim setting from printed copy suggests that when more numerous variants from copy are elsewhere found the creator of these variants (both accidental and substantive) was James himself. 34 After the editor had made a futile attempt with Pragmatism , the initial volume, to apply the more common Greg rationale and insert substantive book revision in the journals used as copy-texts. 35 In "Principles and Methods in the Collected Edition of John Stuart Mill ( Editing Nineteenth Century Texts [1967], p. 117) J. M. Robson remarks that "An electronic eye may find otherwise, but to the human eye there is (in general) a uniformity in accidentals between the substantively revised and unrevised portions of the later editions, a uniformity which does not exist between later revisions and earlier revised passages." The sense of this is not wholly clear to me, but if it attempts to distinguish the uniformity throughout the latest revised edition, for which Dr. Robson is arguing as copy-text, from the lack of uniformity in earlier revised texts, the evidence is not necessarily an indication of Mill's extensive accidental revision in the uniform text but could be the styling applied alike to revised and unrevised sections by the printer of the final edition. Dr. Robson may well be right in his choice of copy-texts, but his evidence is suspect. 36 A complicating factor can be the publisher's revisions also introduced into a revised text, as happened with F. Scott Fitzgerald: see M. J. Bruccoli, Apparatus for F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1974). 37 Naturally, no one would argue that in the transmission of meaning accidentals are as important as substantives, although there is always the example of the letter in Ralph Roister Doister as well as the two versions of Hamlet's what a piece of work is a man speech to show the contrary. I am talking about editorial principle, insofar as it can be implemented, and not expediency in any individual case. Since accidentals in modern times have lost the philological significance that Greg thought worth preserving, if they have not gained correspondingly in importance as a part of the total complex of authorial meaning, then all later texts might be modernized and discussions of copy-text are idle. 38 However, one must always consider the role of authorial oversight; even the scrupulous William James sometimes inadvertently overlooked in one passage anomalies he had set right in another. 39 Few writers are likely to quarrel with normal printer's (or publisher's) styling when the sense is acceptable even though it may differ from their own accidental characteristics, which alone should concern an editor and which, incidentally, are likely to remain constant in later documents. For instance, Stephen Crane seldom put commas between adjectives in series although the printer almost invariably 'corrected' him. He made no effort to remove these commas when he read proof, but neither did he accept the lesson and insert such commas in his subsequent manuscripts. William James usually (although not invariably) omitted the comma in the British fashion before the and or or of a coordinate series of three or more, which American printers usually inserted. He would sometimes in proof remove this inserted comma but perhaps more usually not, although his own practice was never affected in his manuscripts. The question that goes unanswered is whether a writer's indifference, his oversight, or an unwillingness to demand resetting of such departures constitute 'approval' of uncharacteristic accidentals in a revised edition, especially when the setting copy itself exhibited certain categories of these accidentals in the writer's characteristic form. 40 In the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library is preserved a memorandum written by Hitchcock addressed to but not demonstrably seen by Crane which was sent by Hitchcock to the printer in order to correct nine readings in subsequent impressions of the Red Badge . The following semi-query was addressed to Crane but no answer is preserved in case he ever saw it: "I don't understand just what local dialect you give your men, but suppose it to be western New York—I thought 'derned' and 'yeh' did not begin till farther west, but it is doubtless all right." The corrections (some of which are sophistications) are not in themselves evidence of Hitchcock's intervention in the preparation of the typescript for the printer, before or after Crane had himself finally revised it in New Orleans. In fact, it could be suggested that the readings (and the dialect) are matters he would have taken up in any careful publisher's reading of the typescript setting copy. It may be noted that the one major substantive alteration Hitchcock ordered ( Moreover for Too ) caught only one of the four occurrences in the first edition (and manuscript) of this typical Crane locution and is a manifest sophistication. 41 One need not be too casual about these losses, of course: preservation of the proof would help to identify any publisher's alterations, and preservation of the typescript would establish the extent of the publisher's editing of the printer's copy as against Crane's New Orleans revisions. However, if the manuscript is taken as copy-text, the loss is not so great as if the first edition had been selected (or the manuscript not preserved), for the authorial markings in these two documents would not have been extensive (especially in the proofs) and most substantive authorial changes may be identified by comparison of the manuscript with the first edition. 42 Since I have extensively analyzed problems of copy-text, with illustrations, in "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," Essays , pp. 447-487, with further discussion in "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," pp. 488-528, the account here is correspondingly brief. 43 If Jonson did revise some of the accidentals as well as the substantives in the working papers before sending them to the printer, such accidentals would be impossible for an editor to distinguish from those originally present in the working papers but inadvertently not copied faithfully in the fair authorial transcript. Of this nature perhaps are the characteristic parentheses that Simpson notices as appearing in the Quarto Masque of Queens in some places where they are wanting in the preserved fair copy. Of course, from the point of view of a critically edited text, the origin is of no practical account so long as such variants are established (a) as authorial, and (b) as not representing a revision in writing out the fair copy although permitted to stand in the working papers and thence transferred to print. 44 Greg adds that the editor should also record "the alteration whenever the sense is appreciably affected." This selective permissiveness would prevent a reader from reconstructing the original from the apparatus and hence he would never know in any given case whether he was reading the original or the editor's silent substitution. Greg's remarks on the treatment of accidentals in an apparatus are not to be taken seriously as prescripts. 45 If the ideal state prevailed that an editor would produce the same critical text regardless of the choice of copy-text, then the whole matter would be academic and the choice would rest purely on the convenience of the apparatus. But except for multiple-authority texts like newspapers set from a common syndicate proof and preserved in sufficient numbers for statistics to operate, this state is quite theoretical, for few cases permit an editor to be certain about the exact authority of each individual variant accidental. Thus the choice of copy-text will exercise an important influence on the neutral accidentals printed in the critical edition: all those in the copy-text not subject to treatment like substantives must be taken on faith as in general representing more authority than those in the other document(s). 46 The textual commentary in the Centenary Edition (1974), IX, 536-547, may be consulted for the details. More evidence is present, with more variety, in Mosses from an Old Manse (1974), X, 537-556. The transmissional problems of The Snow-Image (1974), XI, 411-422, do not differ in kind except for one or two tales. In all these stories the collected book editions were taken to be of lesser accidental authority than the earlier printings and hence were rejected as copy-texts since Hawthorne had made only a minimum of alteration either in copy or in proof. In short, many more accidental variants appear in the books than those that might be imputed to Hawthorne. Under these circumstances, authority is best preserved, on the odds, by altering the originals in the few cases when the book accidentals give evidence of authorial change than by accepting the book's accidentals en bloc and restoring the forms of the originals only as corrections of the errors in the book. 47 For example, three accidental press-corrections were made in the punctuation of the four pages of the inner forme of sheet B in the revised 1668 edition, but in this same forme two variant spellings from the first edition, two variant word-divisions, three variant capitalizations, and three punctuational differences were not touched although presumably compositorial. If the revised 1668 edition had been chosen as copy-text over the 1667 first, ten unauthoritative accidentals would have been reprinted in order to secure three authorial (not identifiable if they had not been determined by press-correction). However, the third edition of 1670 was also revised. In the same four pages this text makes four substantive alterations. If Dryden had also touched up the accidentals at the same time, on the evidence of the 1668 copy whatever he had altered would be lost among the three changes from 1668 in word-division, twenty-three in capitalization, and eight in punctuation. The revised 1670 edition, therefore, would depart from 1667 in a total of forty-four accidentals, of which only three by a fortunate chance can be identified as authoritative. The major part of the remainder are presumably compositorial, including those categories not press-corrected by Dryden in 1668. 48 This would include radiating texts in which a choice of copy-text rests on the convenience of the reader according to the ease with which he can refer to the apparatus. That is, it is most convenient, usually, to select that radiating text that needs the least correction from the others and thus one that has the fewest unassigned accidentals. When enough witnesses have been preserved so that the statistical tables of the accidental variants can be utilized as the basis for choice, there should be little if any need for an editor to rely on any accidental in the copy-text simply because it occurs in the copy-text, although he may of course take that fact into account when the copy-text document seems on the whole to be relatively faithful and all other evidence is indifferent, as by only partial corroboration from other witnesses. On the other hand, if an editor chooses to adopt G. T. Tanselle's ingenious suggestions for a new kind of apparatus for radiating texts, the need for an arbitrary copy-text vanishes: see his "Editorial Apparatus for Radiating Texts," The Library , 5th ser., 29 (1974), 330-337. 49 The necessary changes according to the textual results of this new discovery are incorporated in the text of the 1977 paperback edition published by the Wesleyan University Press, with page-line references to enable holders of the two-volume Wesleyan-Clarendon edition (1975) to correct their copies pending a second printing of the larger form. 50 Some useful surveys of two of the Shakespeare Folio's compositors' errors in setting against copy may be found in Alice Walker, Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953), especially pp. 31-35, 86-93, 119-120, 130-134, 143-149. Another such list can be found in John S. O'Connor, "A Qualitative Analysis of Compositors C and D in the Shakespeare First Folio," Studies in Bibliography , 30 (1977), 69-74. 51 One may add, as a contributing factor, the possibility with careless authors that an indifferent variant in the revised edition may also be the publisher's editor, as happens in Crane's revised Maggie , and, as mentioned, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's plate revisions. This publisher's intervention can come in a different line of revision, as between an author's manuscript and the copy finally given to the printer, as assumed in Crane's novels published by Appleton although the extent of Ripley Hitchcock's ministrations is still far from certain as compared with those of the printer. 52 If, as seems likely, Fielding's lost manuscript actually contained laid hold on and anywise it might not be enough to show that these locutions could be found elsewhere in his works. Unfortunately, even their appearance at a date later than the 1743 third edition might not provide positive evidence one way or another, for it is clear that some of the readings of the 1749 first edition of Tom Jones (revised about a year later in the fourth edition) repeated the same sort of original readings that had been revised out of Joseph Andrews in 1743 and 1748. What would be needed would be evidence that Fielding used both, whether indiscriminately or chronologically. In that case the third-edition reading could be taken with more confidence as an authorial revision. If the third-edition form never appeared elsewhere in Fielding, it would suffer under the presumption of error, of course. 53 This is an argument to be used with discretion, of course, when the compositorial stints are unidentifiable. In Tom Jones , for instance, I am not troubled by the revised fourth edition's normalization of a country landlady's 'Here's a great young Squire, and a many other great Gentlefolks of Quality' (537.6-8) to and many other , for it is a natural sophistication or eyeskip; and when at 834.30 the same change is made in a reported speech by Squire Western an editor may merely note to himself that the earlier occurrence now seems more probable as sophistication. It seems difficult to believe that Fielding would remove such an idiom from two dialect speaking characters: a literal minded compositor, or even a pair, seems the better explanation. 54 On this evidence it is probable that in Joseph Andrews two examples of the reverse movement, both in the fourth edition of 1748-49, are not revisions but compositorial changes to be ignored in favor of the copy-text: broke for 1-3 broken (151.10) and tore for torn (331.40). 55 Estimate of error outside of positive typographical misprints or quite contrary sense, which do not count as evidence, is partly subjective, of course. Nevertheless, in Tom Jones if one sets aside the cases when the fourth edition followed a variant in its corrupt third-edition copy, there appear to be no certain compositorial substantive errors departing from copy in Book I, only one in Book II, two in Book III, six in Book IV, nine in Book V, seven in Book VI, and so on. Given the quantity of text, this represents greater faithfulness than would be expected in an Elizabethan printing-house. These presumptive errors contrast with seemingly authorial substantive revisions as follows: twenty-three in Book I, eighteen in Book II, eighteen in Book III, thirty-nine in Book IV, forty-three in Book V, and twenty in Book VI. 56 One must repeat that all rules are off when dealing with variant pre-publication scribal transmission of authority as with Shakespeare's two-text plays, or Fletcher's plays with preserved scribal manuscripts in a different line. Usually in such plays the chances for tracing the origin of error in any bibliographical sense are minimal, at least with results likely to win a consensus.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Symmetry in Watermark Sequences by Stephen Spector</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the late Allan Stevenson observed, the study of paper has until recently been historical rather than bibliographical, "and most of the attempts to draw useful inferences out of watermarks (and other aspects of paper) have been uninformed and unscientific." 1 There have, of course, been exceptions to this rule, among the most notable of which was Sir Walter Greg's classic work on the misdated Pavier quartos of Shakespeare. 2 And Stevenson's own inspired contributions to the study of paper, which culminated in his investigation of the Missale speciale , 3 have done much to make the bibliographical analysis of paper evidence more sophisticated and reliable. 4 The principal end of both Greg's work on the Shakespeare quartos and Stevenson's on the Missale was dating, and for this it was necessary for them to compare the paper in several books. Other scholars have used paper evidence to locate textual disruptions, by examining the patterns produced by folding single sheets of paper in specific formats. In the folio format, for example, a sheet of paper is folded once to produce one leaf with a watermark at its center and one unwatermarked leaf. In quartos, the double folding of the sheet splits the watermark so that roughly one half of the mark appears centered at the gutter on each of two conjugate leaves, while the other two leaves of the sheet are unwatermarked. Robert W. Chapman and others have realized that violations of these patterns indicate cancellation or some other disturbance of the gathering. 5 What has not been appreciated, however, is that elaborations on these patterns involving several sheets within gatherings produce complex symmetries in the resultant sequences of watermarks. In the present study I shall propose a method of analyzing watermark sequences which can not only discover the ways in which gatherings were originally formed, but can also identify and locate textual disruptions where this might otherwise be impossible. I shall also try to demonstrate how this mode of analysis, when considered in concert with the literary and bibliographical evidence, can sometimes illumine the history of both a codex and its text. It is worth noting that while earlier analyses of paper evidence have generally been restricted to printed books and have often relied upon several copies of these books, the present approach is suitable to manuscripts, and is valid even when applied to unique codices. To illustrate this method of analysis, I shall refer to Cotton MS. Vespasian D. viii., the N-town Cycle of mystery plays, a small quarto dating from the second half of the fifteenth century. The plays in this text are patently composite, and there is good evidence that the cycle was in part compiled as the manuscript was transcribed; 6 it is therefore well suited to demonstrate some of the possible applications of the approach under discussion in this study. The manuscript is in a British Museum binding and the leaves have been cut and separately mounted on guards, save for a few bifolia which are mounted on single guards. Most of the original signatures and quire-marks have been cut away. Later, perhaps Cottonian, quire-marks do appear, but the quiring they indicate is very odd: according to these marks, six quires contain only two leaves each, while other quires contain three, six, eight, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty leaves. By analyzing the watermark sequences, one can test the accuracy of the quire-marks, and in the process shed light on the compilation of the codex and the plays themselves. As already noted, each folded sheet in the quarto format produces two watermarked leaves, each with roughly one half of the mark, and two un-watermarked leaves. The order in which these leaves actually appear in old manuscript books varies, probably owing to the different positions of the sheets when they were folded (various methods of folding the sheets may also have been a factor, but this seems less likely, and the results would have been the same in any case). The double folding of sheets in quarto produced four distinct patterns of watermark distribution, as I shall try to show. For the purpose of this demonstration, let us assume a fixed manner of folding: first folding the sheet in half and forward, toward the scribe, along a line parallel to the shorter side; then folding it forward again, along a line parallel to the other side. If a sheet sitting in the position illustrated by Figure 1 is folded in this way, the four leaves (let us call them "panels" in this context) will appear in the order 3 1 2 4. The distribution of watermarks will follow a similar pattern. Watermarks are typically representations of objects, such as pots, hands, or bulls, but let us say that by some convenient stroke, the watermark of our sheet of paper consists of the letters "AB." When the sheet is folded in the manner described above, the first leaf in the gathering, Panel 3, has no mark. The second leaf, Panel 1, has the "A" portion of the watermark and the third leaf, Panel 2, bears the "B" portion. The last leaf, Panel 4, has no watermark. If one designates the unwatermarked leaves by dashes, this sequence of watermarks can be represented by the formulation - A B - (actually - ∀ B -, but these formulas will ignore the changes in the position of the watermark with respect to the viewer). In the case of a sheet which happens to be sitting on its other side, as in Figure 2, folding in the manner described above distributes the panels in the order 4 2 1 3, with the watermark pattern - B A -. If the sheet is turned end to end, as in Figure 3, the same manner of folding arranges the panels in the order 1 3 4 2, with the watermark arrangement A — — B. Finally, folding a sheet which sits in the position of Figure 4 places the panels in the order 2 4 3 1, and the watermark sequence is B - - A. Naturally, one can assign the letters A and B to represent the halves of any watermark. And given such a designation, these four patterns, - A B -, - B A -, A - - B, and B - - A, are the watermark sequences one can normally expect to find in a gathering formed by the folding of whole sheets in the quarto format. (The sheets will not usually be physically intact, of course, since cutting the bolt in each sheet in a quarto normally produces two half-sheets—one with the watermark and one without—gathered into a quire, or booklet, for sewing. 7 ) Before looking for these watermark sequences in Vesp. D. viii., we must consider one further test of the method by which sheets were folded: the appearance of the mould-sides and the felt-sides of the paper. The watermark, chain-lines, and, to a lesser extent, wire-lines of the mould made indentations into the side of the paper which faced down upon them. This side of the sheet is called the mould-side or "right" side, while the other side is called the felt-side or the "wrong" side. Obviously, the method of folding determines the locations in which the mould-sides and felt-sides will appear. For example, in a sheet folded so as to produce the pattern 3 1 2 4 in the panels, if the mould-side is the recto of Panel 3 (the first leaf of the gathering), then the verso of Panel 4 must also be the mould-side; in addition, the mould-side must be the verso of Panel 1 and the recto of Panel 2. This produces the pattern for the mould-side of this folded sheet of recto-verso-recto-verso. The only other possible pattern for the appearance of the mould-sides in a folded whole sheet is verso-recto-verso-recto. If neither of these two patterns obtains, then the text has been disturbed, or the scribe did not quire by folding whole sheets. Half-sheets were used in some books, and in such cases, the mould-sides must appear in the patterns recto-verso or verso-recto; if they do not, there has been interpolation, or excision, or both. 8 Now let us turn to the watermark and mould-side sequences in Vesp. D. viii., as represented by the following chart: A quire: r v r v v r r v v r v r r v v r r v r v 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 A 1 -- A 1 -- B 1 -- B 2 -- -- A 1 B 1 -- -- A 2 -- A 1 -- B 1 -- B 1 B quire: r v v r v r v r r v r v v r v ? v r r v 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 -- A 2 -- -- -- A 1 A 2 A 1 -- B 1 A 1 -- B 1 B 2 B 1 -- -- -- B 2 -- C quire: v r v r v r v r 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 C 1 -- -- C 2 D 2 -- -- D 1 D quire: E quire: F quire: v v r v v v v r r r r v v v v r r r 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 -- C 1 E F C 1 -- -- C 2 C 2 -- -- -- -- D 2 D 2 -- -- D 1 G quire: v v v v r v r r r r v v v v r r r r r 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 D 2 D 2 D 2 D 2 -- C 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- D 1 C 2 C 2 C 2 C 2 H quire: v v v v v r ? v v [r] [v] v r r r r r 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 [95] [96] 97 98 99 100 101 102 D 2 -- C 1 -- D 2 -- -- D 2 -- [G] [H] -- C 2 -- D 1 -- C 2 J quire: v v v v v r r r r [v] v v v v r r r r r 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 [112] 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 D 2 -- -- -- D 2 -- D 1 D 1 -- [--] -- C 1 C 1 -- C 2 -- -- -- C 2 K quire: L quire: M quire: v v r r r v v v r v r r r v 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 -- D 2 C 2 -- C 2 -- C 1 -- D 1 C 1 -- D 1 -- D 2 N quire: O quire: r v r r v v r ? r v v r v r v r 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 [143] 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 -- I 1 J 1 -- I 2 -- -- [--] J 2 -- I 1 J 1 -- -- -- A 1 P quire: Q quire: R quire: v r r r v v v r v r r r 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 -- J 2 J 2 -- I 2 -- -- J 1 I 1 -- -- J 2 S quire: r r r r v v v v r r r r v v v v 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 -- K 1 K 1 -- K 2 -- -- K 2 L 2 -- -- L 2 -- L 1 L 1 -- T quire: r r v v [v] [r] r r v v 180 181 182 183 [184] [185] 186 187 188 189 K 1 K 1 -- -- [--] [--] -- -- L 1 L 1 V quire: v v v v v r r r r r v v v v v r r r r r 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 -- -- -- -- D 2 -- C 2 C 2 C 2 C 2 D 2 D 2 D 2 D 2 -- C 2 -- -- -- -- W quire: "Assumption of Mary" v r v r v r r ? v v r v r r v v 210 211 212 223 224 225 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 D 2 -- D 2 C 2 -- C 2 M 1 -- M 2 M 1 -- -- N 1 N 2 -- N 1 The first two quires in the codex consist of a variety of Bunch of Grapes paper. I refer to one half of this watermark, the part with most of the grapes, as A. The complementary portion of the mark, containing a leaf and vegetable elaboration, I call B. As Allan Stevenson has instructed us, watermarks normally occur in slightly distinct pairs, as fraternal twins, so to speak, owing to the use of two moulds in paper production. 9 Such twins do appear in the Bunch of Grapes paper, and I have designated these companion marks AB 1 (comprising A 1 and B 1 ) and AB 2 (consisting of A 2 and B 2 ). 10 Of the four possible watermark sequences, one that is immediately apparent in A quire is - A B - in ff. 9-12. These leaves constitute a single sheet, and ff. 10 and 11 are, in fact, a bifolium, and are mounted on a single guard. If we imagine ourselves to have removed ff. 9-12 from the gathering, another acceptable pattern emerges in ff. 7, 8, 13, and 14. The same is true of ff. 5, 6, 15, and 16; 3, 4, 17, and 18; and 1, 2, 19, and 20. It would seem that A quire was formed by folding one sheet (ff. 1, 2, 19, and 20), then inserting into it another folded sheet (ff. 3, 4, 17, and 18), and so on. This may be graphically represented as follows: The gathering may well have been quired in this way, but another possibility must be considered: judging from the watermark sequence alone, it is possible that four sheets of paper were laid in a pile and then all folded together. The bottom sheet would have produced ff. 1, 8, 13, and 20; the sheet above that ff. 2, 7, 14, and 19; the next sheet ff. 3, 6, 15, and 18; and the top sheet ff. 4, 5, 16, and 17. Into these would have been inserted the folded sheet which comprises ff. 9-12 (note that this sheet could not have been folded along with the others: ff. 1, 10, 11, and 20 do not form an acceptable watermark sequence; nor do ff. 2, 9, 12, and 19). Which of these methods of quiring was actually used, the one in which sheets were folded separately and inserted one into the other, or the "multi-folded" method of folding a pile of sheets simultaneously? 11 Here one can turn for help to the appearance of the mould-sides and felt-sides in the gathering; this is indicated in the chart by the letters "r" and "v" above the folio numbers, designating which side of the leaf, the recto or the verso, is the mould-side. 12 The former reconstruction of the formation of A quire, in which five sheets were separately folded, is entirely consistent with the mould-side sequence in the gathering. In ff. 1, 2, 19, and 20, for example, the mould-sides are in the order recto-verso-recto-verso. The same is true of ff. 3, 4, 17, and 18, while ff. 5, 6, 15, and 16 yield the other normal pattern: verso-recto-verso-recto. The other conjugate leaves also produce these patterns. The multi-folding of four sheets, however, does not fit with the evidence of the mould-side sequence: ff. 3, 6, 15, and 18 produce the sequence recto-recto-verso-verso and ff. 4, 5, 16, and 17 the pattern verso-verso-recto-recto. Thus the gathering was not quired by multi-folding four sheets; nor does the mould-side arrangement allow for three multi-folded sheets. It is possible, though, that two sheets were multi-folded (producing ff. 1, 4, 17, and 20 and 2, 3, 18, and 19) and into them were inserted three separately folded sheets. The other alternative, as noted above, is that all five sheets were separately folded. There is, one might add, no evidence, either from the quiring or the matter written in the gathering, that A quire was in any way altered after it was originally formed. As the reader may by now have surmised, the first step in identifying the symmetry in a watermark sequence is to locate the center of the quire. In B quire this is an easy task: ff. 30 and 31 surround the center of the symmetry in this gathering, with the watermark sequence projecting to the left and right of these leaves (i.e. toward the beginning and end of the gathering) in what might loosely be called a mirror-image pattern. As in A quire, the central four leaves seem to comprise a single folded sheet, and here too the innermost two leaves have been left uncut and mounted as a bifolium. But in this quire we find very strong evidence of multi-folding, for this is almost certainly the explanation of the watermark sequence in ff. 23-28 and 33-38. Clearly, three sheets were laid one atop the other and folded, producing a tripled version of the - A B - pattern. Folios 21, 22, 39, and 40 could have resulted from the folding of a single sheet; the gathering would in that event have been quired by folding one sheet, inserting into it three multi-folded sheets, and then inserting one folded sheet into the whole. But once again another arrangement is possible: all five sheets may have been multi-folded. The bottom sheet would in that case have produced ff. 21, 30, 31, and 40, the next sheet ff. 22, 29, 32, and 39, and so on. The mould-side pattern is congruous with either of these methods of quiring, and both are therefore possible. Quires C , D , F—M (with the exception of ff. 95, 96, and 112), V , and W (except for the interpolated "Assumption of Mary" play on ff. 213-222) consist of paper with the YHS in a Sun watermark. "C" designates the upper portion of this mark, "D" the lower portion. Twins of the mark are indicated by C 1 and C 2 , D 1 and D 2 . 13 The conjugacy of leaves, as indicated by the watermark and mould-side sequences, is corroborated, incidentally, by several tests, including the relative size of the complementary portions of the mark on conjugate leaves and the direction in which the sun's rays point in the watermark design. C quire is rather small, but it appears to be intact, as evidenced by the watermark and mould-side arrangements. I shall discuss the brevity of this quire later in the present study. Quires D , E , and F must be considered together since they constitute a single quire which has been disturbed by an interpolation. E quire, ff. 51-52, appears in the midst of the "Marriage of Mary and Joseph" (Play 10), which begins on f. 49 r , and a variety of evidence makes it certain that E quire was interpolated after the "Marriage" had been transcribed: ff. 51-52 are a different paper from that which appears elsewhere in the codex, 14 and the text on these two leaves was written by a different hand than was the rest of the manuscript; moreover, E quire manifestly interrupts the action of the play, even dividing a stanza between ff. 50 v and 53 r . When E quire was inserted, D quire was split in two, and the resulting threefold division of the text at this point was treated as three separate quires, and so marked. As we shall see, this pattern of events is probably paradigmatic of the division of other gatherings in the codex into small segments. The watermark and mould-side sequences in D and F quires confirm the theory that these two gatherings were originally one. D/F , it seems clear, consisted of four multi-folded sheets (the mould-side pattern disallows the possibility, suggested by the watermark arrangement, that two multi-folded sheets were inserted into two other multi-folded sheets); one leaf following f. 66 has been excised. Folio 49 must have survived from a larger unit of paper which was also part of this gathering: as the first leaf in the "Marriage" it was very probably not attached separately to the rest of the quire, and indeed there is no physical evidence of such an arrangement (e.g. an unfolded stub or extra sewing holes). Folio 49 was, then, an element in either a whole sheet or a half-sheet, which means that D/F quire comprised either eighteen or twenty leaves. 15 An interesting variation on the results of multi-folding appears in G quire. The asymmetrical sequence of watermarks in this gathering may at first seem confusing, but an obvious explanation suggests itself: the sheet which produced ff. 71, 72, 81, and a missing leaf following f. 81 sat head-to-tail with the four other sheets which comprise this quire, and all five sheets were multi-folded (cf. V quire, which was similarly formed). Since there are now nineteen leaves in the gathering, traditional collation would suggest that one leaf was missing somewhere. In order to locate the original position of that leaf, one need only complete the watermark symmetry in the gathering by supplying an unwatermarked leaf after f. 81; this creates a perfect mirror-image pattern extending from the center of the quire between ff. 76 and 77. Other explanations are possible (e.g. interpolation of one or three leaves), but there is no literary or bibliographical evidence to support these ideas. By contrast, the contention that a leaf was excised after f. 81 accords with the textual evidence, for the arrangement of the plays makes it possible that a blank leaf once followed f. 81: "The Trial of Joseph and Mary" (Play 14) ends on f. 81 v and the next play, "The Nativity," begins on f. 82 r . A blank leaf may well have originally stood between these plays, possibly owing to the scribe's copying down the "Nativity" before the "Trial" had been fully transcribed. There is clear evidence that the scribe left leaves blank in just this way elsewhere in the codex. 16 As we have seen, once one has identified the symmetry of a watermark sequence, it is possible to locate the violations of that symmetry, and this can in turn help to discover the number of leaves which may have been lost from a gathering. In H quire, this approach may also help to explain one of the cruces of the cycle: the fact that there is no Play 17. In this gathering, C and D are again YHS in a Sun paper whereas G and H in ff. 95 and 96 designate the complementary portions of a Hand watermark. 17 Folios 95-96, along with f. 112 in the "Baptism" play, were interpolated after the text had been transcribed: they were written by a different hand from the main scribe's on paper which does not appear elsewhere in the manuscript. These leaves lack the normal rubrication of the codex, and f. 112, which is the first leaf of the "Baptism," is the only initial leaf of any play which does not have a play number; clearly this leaf replaced the original initial leaf at some point after the rubricator had numbered the plays, and ff. 95-96 were probably interpolated at the same time. The text of these interpolated leaves gives every sign of being faithful copies of lost originals, blending thematically with the material contiguous to it and conforming to the prosodic variety of that material. Moreover, both the "Magi" and the "Baptism" are incomplete without these interpolations. The most important question about H quire is how many leaves have been lost, and from where? There are now, excluding ff. 95-96, fifteen leaves; one would normally expect either one or five leaves to have been lost. If only one leaf had been lost from the quire, it would have necessarily stood in the present location of ff. 95-96, since both the literary evidence and the watermark and mould-side patterns show that these folios replaced some earlier matter. But the watermark sequence does not square with the loss of only one leaf. It therefore seems probable that five leaves have been lost from the gathering, and this hypothesis is confirmed by the mould-side pattern of the fifteen leaves which have survived from the original quire: v v v v v r ? v v v r r r r r Two inferences can be drawn from this pattern. First, multi-folding was employed rather than individual folding of sheets. Second, five leaves have been lost: three or four "mould-side-recto" leaves after the first five folios in the gathering, and one or two "mould-side-verso" leaves before the last five folios. The other alternative is that the gathering was quired with half-sheets. This is unlikely, however, because the main scribe seems not to have normally quired in this manner while transcribing the bulk of the codex, as I shall show presently. Furthermore, the mould-side sequence in this quire clearly seems to be the quintupled verso-recto-verso-recto arrangement which characterizes five multi-folded whole sheets. In order to discover the original location of the five lost leaves, we must look first to the position now occupied by ff. 95-96, since, as noted above, these leaves evidently replaced earlier material. The watermark and mould-side sequences rule out the possibility that five or two leaves once stood there, leaving open the question of whether one, three, or four folios were originally present. Any conjecture beyond this must necessarily be uncertain, but one hypothesis fits so well with the evidence in the quire that it deserves mention, viz. four leaves have been removed after f. 91 and one leaf after f. 94. To begin with, it is most probable that one leaf is missing after f. 94 (as opposed to three or four leaves) because only one leaf's worth of material was copied onto ff. 95-96: these two leaves contain eighty-two lines of text and two one-line stage directions as against eighty-four lines of text on f. 94. 18 The loss of three or four leaves from this position is improbable since it would suggest that a significant amount of material had been removed from the middle of the "Magi," a play which seems complete as we have it with respect both to itself and to the other extant English Magi plays. If, therefore, one leaf is missing after f. 91, where could the other four lost leaves have originally stood? Several answers are possible, most of which involve a complicated pattern of excisions at unrelated points in the quire; but excisions of this kind obtain in no other quire, and are therefore unlikely to have occurred here. A more convincing solution is suggested by evidence within H quire that something has been removed after f. 91. Most significantly, the "Shepherds," which ends on f. 91 r , is Play 16, and the "Magi," which begins on f. 92 r , is Play 18, with no play in between. It seems safe to say that something, presumably a whole play, either followed or was intended to follow the "Shepherds." The watermark and mould-side sequences indicate that if one of the lost leaves originally stood after f. 94, as we have posited, then the other four leaves could have followed f. 91; this is perhaps the only arrangement, in fact, which accords with the literary evidence and does not scatter the missing leaves among different plays in locations which show no sign of textual disturbance. The four missing leaves would have provided space enough for a short play: the "Purification of Mary" (Play 19) takes up about that amount of space, for example. Indeed, if the scribe left the four leaves blank and went on to the "Magi" (and he often did leave space blank in this way, as noted above), the "Purification" may have been the very play which was originally intended to be number 17. Not only would it fit thematically between the "Shepherds" and "Magi," but there is also reason to believe that it was an addition to the original cycle, and that the change of plans over its place of insertion led to confusion in the numbering of the plays that follow it. 19 In any event, locating the missing leaves after ff. 91 and 94 yields the following hypothetical arrangement for the original quire (C/D indicates "either C or D"): This hypothesis about H quire is very strongly corroborated by a peculiar bit of material evidence: the extreme narrowness of ff. 92 and 93. These are the narrowest leaves in the codex, with f. 92 124-125 mm. wide and f. 93 118-119 mm. wide, as against a width of 136-140 mm. for most leaves. The outer margins of these two leaves have been completely cropped, and some of the text and part of the playnumber 18 (on f. 92 r ) have been cut away; the inner margins are of normal width. Apparently these leaves were loose from the gathering when the manuscript was cut for binding—and their condition at that time may very well be explained by the above history of the quire. According to this hypothesis, f. 92 and its conjugate leaf would have been the central leaves in the quire, with f. 93 and its conjugate leaf immediately beneath them. These leaves would have been the most likely to move away from the sewing, since there would have been no leaves above them to hold them down. Once they had loosened from the gathering, the conjugate leaves would necessarily have been cut to the same extent as ff. 92 and 93; but since no other extant leaf in the gathering, or indeed the codex, displays this degree of cropping, it seems probable that the conjugate leaves had already been excised at the time of the cutting. Two final observations should be made about H quire. First, the gathering as we have reconstructed it is entirely consistent with the inferences drawn above from the surviving mould-side sequence. Second, our hypothetical history of the quire may provide its own explanation for the appearance of the two interpolated leaves: the removal of the four leaves which originally followed f. 91 may have resulted in the replacement by ff. 95-96 of the leaf which once followed f. 94; for the conjugate of this leaf, which would have followed f. 91, would also have been excised. In J quire f. 112 probably replaced two watermarked conjugate leaves. Folio 111, the two missing leaves, and f. 113 comprised a separately-folded sheet, and ff. 105-110 and 114-119 were multi-folded (ff. 107-108 and 116-117 constitute a sheet which sat head-to-foot with the other two multi-folded sheets). Folios 103-104 and 120-121 appear to contain the first clearcut evidence that the main scribe ever quired with half-sheets, for the mould-side pattern of these four leaves does not fit with any of the ways by which whole sheets might have been folded to produce this gathering. This arrangement may have resulted from textual disturbance, but I know of no evidence to support such a hypothesis. At this point it may be apposite to consider the implications of quiring with half-sheets. G. S. Ivy, in his excellent article "The Bibliography of the Manuscript Book," discusses two of the principal ways in which quires were formed: the "bifolium" method, in which a single sheet was folded once to yield two leaves, and the multi-folded method of simultaneously folding two large sheets. 20 As we have seen, in Vesp. D. viii. there is evidence of further methods of forming quires: the double folding of single whole sheets and the multi-folding of three or more whole sheets; the single folding of a half-sheet can be considered a variety of the bifolium method. As Ivy says (p. 39), once the leaves of a membrane codex have been cut, it is not usually possible to assert whether the bifolium or the multi-folded method has been used. But in Vesp. D. viii. we see that watermark and mould-side sequences in paper manuscripts can indicate that whole sheets were employed, and that many of these were multi-folded. In one sense, the bifolium method was probably always used in this codex, since after the sheets were folded (individually or in piles), they were presumably unfolded and cut along the fold parallel to the shorter side. The resulting two stacks of bifolia were then placed in their original positions. If, however, one understands the bifolium method to mean the formation of quires by piling non-conjugate half-sheets in random arrangement, then it is unlikely that the main scribe used this method in the codex very often. The watermark sequences in quires B , G , T , and V , for example, are unlikely to have been arrived at by chance; rather, they almost certainly resulted from the multi-folding of whole sheets. 21 Also implausible is the idea that unrelated half-sheets were randomly gathered to produce mould-side patterns like v v v v r r r r v v v v r r r [r] in D/F quire, r r r r v v v v r r r r v v v v in S quire, and v v v v v r r r r r v v v v v r r r r r in V quire—all of which are consonant in addition with watermark sequences which result from folding whole sheets. In sum, the main scribe of Vesp. D. viii. appears normally to have folded whole sheets, either individually or in piles. Half-sheets may possibly have been used sometimes, but it seems significant that this question arises with reference only to those quires which have evidently experienced some physical disruption: every gathering the main scribe formed which has escaped such disruption appears to have been quired by folding whole sheets of paper. Consider, for example, R quire. The mould-side sequence in this gathering indicates textual disturbance or quiring by half-sheet, or both. Before one attempts to choose among these options it is helpful to observe that R quire belongs to Passion Play 1, a discrete sequence of Passion plays which has experienced much physical disruption. Passion Play 1 now comprises quires N-R , but of these, O quire is manifestly an interpolation (as is f. 143). 22 In addition, Q quire bears several signs of having been an insertion into Passion Play 1. First there is the evidence of the catchwords: the scribe usually placed a catchword at the ends of quires in Passion Plays 1 and 2. A catchword after N quire, for example, contains the first words of P quire. 23 But no catchwords appear after P and Q quires, indicating that the scribe did not consider them to be normal gatherings. Secondly, f. 153 v , the page facing Q quire, and f. 155 v , the last page of this quire, are short pages: the scribe's text was not sufficient to fill these pages. He apparently stopped writing on f. 153 v and went on to f. 156 r ; ff. 154-155 were inserted later, and the new text filled most of the space on these leaves, but not all. The third sign that Q quire was inserted into the text is that the scribe wrote long elaborate ascenders, an extremely unusual feature in this codex, in the top lines of ff. 153 v and 154 r ; this was perhaps a reminder to himself of where to include the additional leaves. A final indication that Q quire was an interpolation is provided by the literary evidence: Christ's exposition of the symbolism of the foods and accoutrements of the Last Supper on ff. 154-155 repeats much of what he says on f. 153 v . Indeed, the interpolation of ff. 154-155 may well have resulted from the decision to alter this part of the "Last Supper" (Play 27). Christ's exposition on ff. 153-155 is more than twice as long as the longest analogue in the extant English medieval drama, extending over one hundred lines, and is often considered one of the hallmarks of the N-town Cycle; yet it appears, as we have seen, to have resulted from revision as Passion Play 1 was transcribed. P and R quires, then, may have originally been one gathering which was split by the interpolation of Q quire, just as D/F quire was almost certainly divided by the intrusion of E quire. If P and R were one quire, and if they were formed by folding whole sheets, then the watermark and mould-side patterns indicate that further substantial alteration of the quire must also have taken place. Alternatively, if it was quired with half-sheets, only two leaves following f. 163 (the leaves which would have been conjugate with ff. 152-153) need have been displaced. At the least one can say that these quires have been in some way physically disturbed, and it may therefore be impossible to reconstruct how they were formed. A similar arrangement obtains in quires K-M , and an analogous alteration of the text, probably involving the interpolation of L quire, may well account for it. 24 Looking briefly at the remainder of the codex, one may observe that the two gatherings which constitute Passion Play 2, S and T quires, appear to comprise four multi-folded sheets and two multi-folded sheets respectively. 25 Folios 184-185, the chain-spaces of which correspond to the Bunch of Grapes or YHS in a Sun paper, were interpolated into T quire as part of the compilation of the cycle. 26 V quire comprises five multi-folded sheets of YHS in a Sun paper (ff. 194-195 and 204-205 sat head-to-foot with the other sheets in the pile). Finally, W quire has lost two leaves, one before and one after the gathering; the latter leaf probably contained the conclusion of "Doomsday" (Play 42). More leaves may, of course, have been lost before and after this quire, but there is no literary or bibliographical evidence that this happened. Folios 213-222, the "Assumption of Mary" (Play 41), were interpolated into W quire: these leaves are a different paper from that found elsewhere in the codex, and the play is written in a different hand. 27 The outer leaves of this play comprise a half-sheet, and since f. 213 is a flyleaf, this scribe may have quired in this instance with a bifolium. But it is also possible that the two leaves which were conjugate with ff. 213 and 222 were also once employed as flyleaves for this play; such an arrangement was quite common in small independent medieval texts, which required multiple flyleaves to protect them until they were bound into larger volumes (Ivy, pp. 53-54). In sum, bibliographical analysis of the paper in Vesp. D. viii. illumines some of the steps in the compilation of the codex. By examining the overall patterns in the evidence, one may draw reasonably confident inferences about the main scribe's habits of quiring. First of all, it should be said that the present quire-marks appear to be accurate. But one can look back to an earlier stage and reconstruct the physical make-up of the manuscript before the many interpolations and excisions. As we have seen, quires A , B , possibly D/F , H , J , and V each appears originally to have contained twenty leaves. Significantly, all but three of the remaining quires were evidently additions to the original text. 28 It therefore appears that the main scribe's normal practice as he transcribed the bulk of the manuscript was to quire in twenties, and the three exceptions are all explicable. To work from last to first, W quire, the last gathering in the codex, might well be expected to be small, since the scribe had only a limited amount of material left to copy when he wrote this quire. 29 K (or K/M ) quire was also in a sense a "final" gathering because it precedes the Passion Plays; since these sequences were written down independently of the rest of the codex, there was a limited amount of material available for this quire. The third short gathering is C quire, in which is written most of "The Conception of Mary" (Play 8) and all of "The Presentation of Mary in the Temple" (Play 9). Good evidence indicates that these and other Marian plays were added to the cycle as the codex was being transcribed. 30 D/F quire had already been at least partially copied down as these plays were added, and so C quire too was in a sense a "final" gathering: only a limited amount of material could be transcribed on it. Thus Vesp. D. viii., which has often been considered a perplexing patchwork collection of disparate material, was originally quite orderly: apparently it consisted of several quires of twenty leaves each, with a few gatherings which were necessarily smaller; 31 all of these were made up of Bunch of Grapes or YHS in a Sun paper. The irregularity in the size of gatherings and the bewildering distribution of paper types were created during the processes of the compilation of the cycle. Before concluding I should like to note that analysis of watermark symmetries is not restricted to the quarto format. In folios, for example, one may expect symmetries to obtain, radiating out from the centers of gatherings in inverted and complementary patterns. For instance, if a quire begins with three marked and two unmarked leaves, it should end with two marked and three unmarked leaves. In practice, the symmetries may be fairly complex; e.g. a gathering which begins with three watermarked leaves, then one unmarked leaf, then four marked, one unmarked, and three marked leaves may be expected to conclude with the inverted complementary pattern of three unmarked leaves, then one marked, four unmarked, one marked, and three unmarked leaves. This pattern actually occurs in Harley MS 2013, one of the five cyclic versions of the Chester mystery plays. Transcribed in the year 1600, this folio codex contains no signatures or quire-marks, although there is foliation, presumably by the scribe, George Bellin. For the present I wish only to demonstrate that the quiring of this manuscript can be discovered by reference to watermark and mould-side sequences. I shall therefore represent these patterns in an arbitrary number of leaves, say, ff. 1-70: 32 The first center of symmetry is between ff. 10 and 11, the next between ff. 33 and 34, and the third between ff. 57 and 58. Quire 1 includes ff. 1-20 and quire 2 ff. 22-45 (this is the gathering which was described in the above illustration of watermark-sequence symmetry in the folio format). To which gathering can we assign f. 21? This folio has apparently lost its conjugate leaf, which must have stood either before f. 1 or after f. 45, the last leaf in quire 2. The latter possibility is unlikely, firstly because there is no sign of textual disturbance between ff. 45 and 46 (which are the second and third leaves of the "Nativity" play), and also because the mould-side pattern would be most peculiar if f. 21 and its conjugate leaf belonged to quire 2: f. 21 would be the only "mould-side-verso" leaf in the first half of quire 2, and the only initial leaf in any gathering in the manuscript to have its mould-side on the verso; the mould-side arrangement would also be anomalous with respect to the missing conjugate leaf. 33 On the other hand, locating f. 21 in quire 1 fits perfectly with the mould-side pattern and makes good sense on another count as well: the conjugate leaf would have preceded f. 1, and might very well have been a flyleaf; its excision would therefore have been quite natural. Quire 3 comprises ff. 46-69, and on f. 70 begins quire 4. Note that the mould-side patterns in each case agree with these findings, and in themselves indicate the centers and limits of gatherings. The collation of the entire codex, taking into account cancelled leaves, appears to be: 1 22 (—1 1 ) 2-4 24 5 24 (— 5 14 ) 6 22 7—8 24 9 20 (—91). 34 Interestingly, lines of string appear not only at the centers of several gatherings, but also in between quires, and occasionally elsewhere. The locations of such strings are sometimes thought to be reliable guides to collation, but in this manuscript and others, they clearly are not reliable. I have proposed in this study a method of analyzing symmetries, and violations thereof, in the watermark and mould-side sequences of paper codices. I have tried to show that this kind of analysis can be an essential tool in detecting and locating interpolations and excisions, and in disclosing the history of literary documents. It seems fair to say in view of the findings of the present study that examinations of the material evidence in many paper manuscripts should now be reconsidered. 35</field>

Although Stevenson's analysis of the paper in the Missale speciale seems indisputable, his dating of the text, and the use of watermarks to date early texts in general, have been seriously questioned by Curt F. Bühler; see "Watermarks and the Dates of Fifteenth-Century Books," SB , 9 (1957), 217-224, and "Last Words on Watermarks," PBSA , 67 (1973), 1-16. 4 See, for example, his "New Uses of Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence," SB , 1 (1948-49), 149-182; "Watermarks are Twins," SB , 4 (1951-52), 57-91; "Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence," SB , 6 (1954), 181-195; and "Paper as Bibliographical Evidence," Library , 5th ser., 17 (1962), 197-212. G. Thomas Tanselle's "The Bibliographical Description of Paper," SB , 24 (1971), 27-67, admirably surveys analyses of paper by John Carter and Graham Pollard, Stevenson, and others, and suggests methods of presenting the results of paper analysis in descriptive bibliographies. One fruitful analysis of paper evidence which appeared after Tanselle's survey is found in David V. Erdman's The Notebook of William Blake (1973), pp. 2-7. 5 Chapman wrote in Cancels (1930), p. 33, that "if a watermark is certainly absent when it should be present, or present when it should certainly be absent, or is the wrong watermark, then the leaf is a cancel"; Chapman acknowledged that this test is only negatively valid. Clifford Leech explained a disturbance in a seventeenth-century text partially on the grounds that in the quarto format one sheet cannot produce three unwatermarked leaves ("A Cancel in Southerne's The Disappointment , 1684," Library , 4th ser., 13, [1932-33], 396). See also Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), pp. 222-30. 6 See my article, "The Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript: Cotton Vespasian D. viii.," which will appear in Leeds Studies in English . 7 Graham Pollard, in "Notes on the Size of the Sheet," Library , 4th ser., 22 (1941-42), 107, discusses the practice of transcribing sheets before they were cut. This method of "imposing" material as printers were later to do would have been most practical in producing multiple copies of fixed texts. It is unlikely that Vesp. D. viii. was written down in this way since it was a one-off job and was compiled as it was being transcribed. I am greatly indebted to Dr. A. I. Doyle for advice on this and other questions about the study of paper manuscripts. 8 See Stevenson, "Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence," passim . 9 "Watermarks are Twins," passim . 10 Watermark AB 1 measures about 61 x 11 [26.5|27] 10 and is similar in design to Briquet 13055 and 13056. Mark AB 2 measures about 68 x 14[25|32]4.5 and its design is in part horizontally inverted with respect to AB 1 . (See Tanselle, "Bibliographical Description of Paper," pp. 46-48, for an explanation of the notation of watermark dimensions.) 11 The term "multi-folded" is used in this sense by G. S. Ivy in "The Bibliography of the Manuscript Book," The English Library before 1700 , eds. Francis Wormald and C. E. Wright (1958), p. 38. See n. 20 in the present study. 12 Despite Allan Stevenson's assurances to the contrary ("Chain-Indentations in Paper," p. 182), it is occasionally very difficult to distinguish the mould-side of a leaf from the felt-side. This is sometimes the result of heavy wear, or of washing and pressing, but in other instances it may be a function of the qualities of the particular kind of paper one is examining. In Vesp. D. viii., for example, paper with the mark IJ is comparatively easy to examine in this regard while paper with the MN watermark is extremely difficult. I indicate the leaves of which I have been unable to identify the mould-side by a question mark above the folio number. 13 CD 1 measures about 42 x 2[36.5|5], CD 2 about 44.5 x [3.5|37.5|2]. The mark generally resembles Briquet 9477, although it differs in detail from that tracing. CD 1 is distinguished from CD 2 by several details in the design, including a defective ray opposite the "Y" in "YHS." 14 Folios 51-52 contain watermark EF, a one-armed pot surmounted by a cross which measures about 40 x 5[15]5. This mark does not correspond to tracings in any of the watermark collections, but it contains some similarities to Briquet 12496, 12498, and 12501. 15 Some confusion was evidently caused by the inclusion of a group of plays at precisely the time that D/F quire was being transcribed (see Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript"). This resulted in significant physical alteration of the manuscript, and it is possible that a leaf preceding f. 49 was lost as part of this process. If so, D/F quire was originally a twenty. 16 See Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript." The two blank leaves which have survived from the original text, ff. 105 and 120, both occur between plays (I discount f. 96 and the flyleaves of Passion Play 2 [f. 164] and the "Assumption of Mary" play [f. 213], since these are all additions to the original manuscript; see notes 17, 27, and 28 in the present study). 17 Since these leaves have been mounted uncut as a bifolium, the watermark is intact. It measures about 70 x 1[20]7 and is a long, graceful hand surmounted by a pentangle; a "B" or some similar form is on the palm and a bit of lacing appears at the wrist. This mark does not correspond to any of the tracings in the watermark collections. 18 Half of f. 96 r and all of f. 96 v are blank. 19 See K. S. Block, The Ludus Coventriae , EETS ES 120 (1922), p. xxviii. Miss Block suggested that one additional leaf originally followed f. 91 while two leaves followed f. 94, and mistakenly added that "the correspondence of watermarks in this quire supports this." See also my "The Genesis of the N-town Cycle," Yale Univ. Diss., 1973, p. 107. 20 Ivy, p. 38. Dr. Ivy argues that multi-folding involved folding the sheet first on a line parallel to the longer side, then on a line parallel to the shorter side. In Vesp. D. viii., however, the folding in each case seems to have been the other way around, with the first fold parallel to the shorter side, the second parallel to the longer side. 21 For an arrangement which is more typical of the bifolium method of quiring, see the watermark sequence in Harley MS. 2013, as represented later in the present article. 22 See Esther L. Swenson, An Inquiry into the Composition and Structure of the Ludus Coventriae , Univ. of Minnesota Studies in Language and Literature, no. 1 (1914), p. 55; W. W. Greg, Bibliographical and Textual Problems in the English Miracle Cycles (1914), p. 115; and Spector, "The Genesis of the N-Town Cycle," pp. 65-70. All of O quire appears to be Bunch of Grapes paper while the rest of Passion Play 1 consists of paper with the mark of a Bull's Head surmounted by an X. This mark, which I designate IJ, bears some resemblance to Briquet 14184 and 14189. IJ1 measures about 74 x 2[32]8; IJ2 measures about 70 x 7[29]6 and differs slightly in design from IJ1. 23 The cancellation of catchwords on f. 148 v provides evidence about the stages in which O quire was interpolated; see Swenson, p. 55, and Greg, Bibliographical and Textual Problems , p. 115. 24 Note that the mould-side patterns in K and L quires rules out the possibility that ff. 122-25 comprise a single whole sheet. Interestingly, if K/M quire was formed by folding whole sheets, it would originally have been a twenty. 25 KL is a variety of Two Crossed Keys watermark which resembles Briquet 3887. KL 1 measures about 47 x 14.5[16.5|25.5]4.5, and KL 2 , which differs in minor details from its twin, measures about 51 x 6[24|18]15. 26 See Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript." 27 These leaves contain a Two-Wheeled Cart watermark which resembles Briquet 3528. MN 1 measures about 69 x 12.5[19|22]8 and is slightly different in design from MN 2 , which measures about 69 x 12[20|20]10. This play may have been the last substantive addition to the cycle; see Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript." 28 Passion Plays 1 and 2 (quires N and P-T ) appear to have been transcribed at a different time from the rest of the manuscript; see Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript." Quires E , K , L , and O and the "Assumption of Mary" (ff. 213-222) have already been discussed. 29 Ivy observes that the scribes' tendency to shorten their quires when little of the text remained to be copied is particularly noticeable (p. 41). 30 See Spector, "Composition and Development of an Eclectic Manuscript." 31 It is worth noting that an examination of the distances between the sewing holes in each leaf confirms the findings of the present study. These measurements are tricky to compile since the holes in many cases enlarged in an irregular fashion or were otherwise distorted, but they can identify within very general limits the constituents of quires; this is therefore a good form of corroborative evidence, at least. 32 Mark A is a one-handled pot. A 1 measures 58.5 x [20], A 2 58.5 x [20|1]. Mark B is also a pot with one handle of which twin B 1 measures 48 x 1[17.5]3.5 while twin B 2 measures 46.5 x 1[17.5]3.5 and differs slightly in appearance from B 1 . Mark C is a large and elaborate two-handled pot. C 1 measures 74.5 x [4.5|20.5|4], C 2 74.5 x [6|21|3.5]. When viewed right-side up from the mould-side of the paper, C 1 is to the left of the deckle while C 2 is to the right. Mark D is a pot with one handle, surmounted by a crescent. D 1 measures 73.5 x [4.5|22] as against a measurement of 70.5 x [7.5|21] for D 2 . Of these marks, only D is similar to the watermark tracings: it bears some resemblance to Briquet 12803 and Heawood 3583. The foliation I employ is that of the modern foliater rather than Bellin's. 33 One very tentative exception is f. 205, the last leaf in the codex, which may be mould-side-recto. This is uncertain, however, because it is unusually difficult to distinguish the mould-sides of the paper in the final gathering. To make matters more difficult, the conjugate leaf of f. 205 is absent (as indicated by the watermark sequence). In any event, the remainder of this quire appears to conform to the normal pattern in the manuscript in which the first half of the gathering is mould-side-recto, the second half mould-side-verso. 34 For a different collation of this codex, see R. M. Lumiansky and David Mills, eds., The Chester Mystery Cycle , EETS SS 3 (1974), I, xix. 35 I wish to thank Dr. A. I. Doyle, Professor Norman Davis, Richard Proudfoot, N. R. Ker, and Martin Stevens for their advice and encouragement concerning watermark study. I am grateful to the officials of the British Library for allowing me to examine Vesp. D. viii. and Harley 2013, and to the American Council of Learned Societies, which provided generous fellowship support.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Direction Line as Bibliographical Evidence: Sheet K in Crowne's City Politiques , 1683 by B. J. McMullin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the first edition of John Crowne's 'Plot' play City Politiques , a quarto published in February 1683, sheet K is found in two states, the order of which is not readily to be determined. The variants in readings are confined to K(i), though the re-arrangement of type pages necessitated by the changes carries over into K(o); the pages affected are K1 v —4 r (pp. 66-71). Of the 37 exemplars known to have survived, 17 have K in one state, 20 in the other, so that the weight of numbers cannot be brought to bear on the problem of priority. Nor is there any apparent 'literary' or 'aesthetic' argument which would indicate the direction of change. Even when the direction can be shown from bibliographical evidence, the reason for the changes remains unexplained. The major difference is that the 17 (group [a]) have 11 lines (K3 v , l. 32-K4 r , l. 2) not found in the other 20 (group [b]), which in turn have 6 lines (K2 r , ll. 26-31) not in the other 17: (a) Pod . The Lord Treafurer's place; I am to be Lord Treafurer, Boy,] ſo the Whigs are all to go to Pot, and the Court to win the Game Boy, which they had done long ſince, if they had put one Black Rook into the Bag where they put me; but the Games their own in getting me, they'l pick up t'other men apace; the Doctor's a deſperate black Knight, skips over Rooks, Biſhops, nay, the Queen her ſelf, and checks the King, but he'l be ſnap'd. Cra . Why do you call the Doctor a Knight? Pod . Becauſe a Knight's notch'd in the Crown, and the Do-[K4 r ] ctor's a little crack'd there, but he and all the Whigs will be ſnap'd ---- And hey then up go we . [ Sings and Dances . (b) Dr . The Viceroy is a pure Canary-Bird, I'le have him turn'd out of his place, I'le prove he is a Mahometan , he was Circumciſed at Bar-bar-badoes . Pod . I believe you mean Barbary , Doctor. Dr . Why, ay, Barbadoes is the Latin name for Barbary . I love to ſwear like a Scholar, and a Doctor, as I am. In essence, during the printing of K(i), the 'black knight' lines (and several lines elsewhere) were deleted in favour of the 'canary bird' lines (and several lines elsewhere); alternatively the 'canary bird' lines were deleted in favour of the 'black knight' lines. If the former was what occurred, the line-count was reduced by three; if the latter, it was increased by three. Both episodes are at the expense of the by-now-discredited Titus Oates, the Doctor of the play. The chess analogy, culminating in the commonplace reference to the refrain of 'The Whigs' Exaltation', is apparently Crowne's invention. And the 'canary bird' lines are largely concerned with Oates's attempt to have Adam Elliot convicted as a Jesuit (Oates claimed that Elliot was also a Mahometan and therefore circumcised, a claim which Elliot was able to disprove conclusively). In seeking to explain the deletion of the 'black knight' passage one might argue that the lines were objectionable at Court, ascribing to Oates the power to incapacitate Charles II; on the other hand one might argue that the 'canary bird' passage was equally objectionable, implying—with the reference to circumcision (a treatment for venereal disease) —that the King was poxed. As it is, neither passage is obviously preferable to the other, and neither is dramatically essential. Both passages are independent of their surroundings, making it impossible to understand why the deletion and addition did not occur at the same place, since the procedure adopted involved the destruction of part of the already-printed sheets. The other variants are these: 1. K1 v , ll. 1-3 (a) [ Pod .] . . . ſay whether you ſaw your Mother in the Garden-houſe wi' Florio , or not? Cra . Why ſould I ſwear that ---- Pod . Look upon her. (b) [ll. 1-2 as (a)] Cra . Why I will ſwear that ---- [l. 4 as (a)] The spacing in (a) is even, whereas in (b) there is greater space before and after 'I will'; but whatever the direction of change, it has been obscured because the line has been rejustified. The context favours 'I will' as the preferred reading: Craffy is about to swear against his mother, but is required by law to look at the accused while giving evidence as a prosecution witness in a criminal case, which figuratively he is—hence the Podesta's following injunction. ('ſhould I' constitutes Craffy's questioning of his father's order to say whether he saw his mother and Florio together, certainly a defensible reading.) 2. K1 v , ll. 39-40 (a) Cra . Lock me up? how ſhall I come at my Mother then? now I think on't, I have a Picklock in my Pocket. [ Ex.Serv. Cra. (b) Cra. Loc kme up? . . . . Pox take it. [ Ex.Serv. Cra. The spacing of l. 39 varies: either the original poor spacing of (b) was corrected in the course of altering l. 40 or the original proper spacing of (a) was disturbed in the course of the alteration. The latter is more likely, but not demonstrable. The actual picking of the lock does not occur until K3 v (p. 70): it could be argued that the reference to the picklock was deleted for various 'dramatic' reasons, and just as forcefully that it was inserted for other 'dramatic' reasons. 3. K2 r , ll. 8-9 (a) [ Flo .] . . . the very Devils have more care of us, than our pretended Friends have. A Spirit appear'd to a Country Maid, and (b) [l. 8 as (a)] tended Friends. . . . . and The close spacing of (a) contrasts with the wide spacing of (b). The evidence of spacing inclines towards (b) as the later state, but it is not conclusive, since the spacing varies greatly from line to line on this page. The inclusion of 'have' avoids a possible ambiguity, though it is the third occurrence of the word in the sentence and therefore a possible candidate for removal. 4. K2 r , ll. 24-26 (a) [ Br .] . . . . they never fay one wiſe word, nor ever come into any wiſe Company: I'le go put all the Town in Arms. [ Exit. Bri. (b) . . . . never . . . . Company. Dr . The Viceroy is a pure Canary-Bird . . . . (l. 32) Bri . Well, I'le go put all the Town in Arms. [ Exit. Bri. The change in l. 25 is inseparable from the addition or deletion of the 'canary bird' lines. The space at the end of l. 25 in (b) suggests that it is the earlier state, since a change from (a) to (b) would have required only a change of punctuation sorts, whereas a change from (b) to (a) would have required re-justifying the line to make it occupy the full measure. The speech prefix ' Bri. ' is not significant in (b) l. 32: both forms appear in this part of the play. (At this point the pages get out of step, so that the last lines are equated in this way: (a) K2 r , l. 38 = (b) K2 v , l. 7 (b) K2 r , l. 37 = (a) K2 r , l. 31 (a) K2 v , l. 40 = (b) K3 r , l. 7 (b) K2 v , l. 40 = (a) K2 v , l. 33 (a) K3 r , l. 34 = (b) K3 v , l. 7 (b) K3 r , l. 34 = (a) K3 r , l. 27.) 5.

It is not possible to show whether the change is a preparation for the incorporation of the 'black knight' passage or a consequence of its deletion. (The last lines of K3 v equate in this way: (b) K3 v , l. 39 = (a) K3 v , l. 32 (a) K3 v , ll. 33-40 have no equivalent in (b). The two texts agree from (a) K4 r , l. 3 = (b) K4 r , l. 1.) 6. K4 r , l. 23 (a), l. 21 (b) (a) Enter Podefta and Craſty peeping . (b) . . . . Craffy . . . . 'Craffy' is correct, but it is not impossible that 'Crafty' is the later state 'corrected' in conformity with a form that does appear occasionally, e.g. in a stage direction on I4 v . 7. K4 r , ll. 35-37 (a), ll. 33-36 (b) (a) [ Gov .] . . . Arm the City at mid-night, and fend your Agitators to diſperfe new minted lies among 'em, the Coin wherewith you raife all your Forces. I have order to fecure you all. (b) [l. 33 as (a) l. 35] tators abroad to diſperfe . . . . the Coin wherewith you pay all . . . . to fecure you all. In (a) l. 36 the spacing is even, whereas in (b) l. 34 'the Coin' is preceded by a space of 5mm., suggesting that the line in (b) embodies the corrected reading. The effect of the change—whatever the direction—is indifferent. The reading 'pay' in (b) l. 35 seems more appropriate than 'raiſe' in (a) l. 37, though it is not so obviously superior as to point to its being the later state. The evidence for the direction of change is, up to this point, ambiguous: 4. favours (a) as the corrected state, 6. favours (b), and the remainder are inconclusive. The best that can be said is that the evidence of spacing and meaning tends to support the view that (b) is the later state of sheet K. Despite the relocation of lines in pages 67-71 (K2 r -4 r ), which leaves K2 r , 3 v and 4 r either one line shorter in (b) or one line longer in (a), the height of the type pages (including catch-word) 1 remains unchanged. On K2 r the difference of one line is accounted for by the increase/decrease in the space after the stage direction. On K3 v the difference is accounted for by the space after the stage direction which occurs in (b) on this page but on K3 r in (a). On K4 r (a) begins with the final two lines of the 'black knight' episode, and the Governour's final speech occupies four lines—see 7. above; (b) lacks the 'black knight' episode, and the Governour's speech occupies five lines. But the type pages in (a) and (b) being the same height, the extra line of text in (a) is accounted for in (b) by an extra amount of white space before the second stage direction equal to one line of type, which thus distinguishes this stage direction not only from its appearance in (a) but also from the first stage direction on K4 r in both (a) and (b). The deviation from the norm suggests that (b) is probably the later state, but the conclusive evidence is in the direction line. In both (a) and (b) the last line of text on K4 r appears in the direction line, which otherwise contains the catch-word ' Bri. ', but only in (a) is it necessary that text appear in the direction line—i.e. (a) must be the earlier state of K4 r . The presence of text in the direction line must have been determined by (a), 2 and the filling-out of a page one line short accomplished in (b) not by resetting in order to separate text and catch-word, thus creating two lines from one, but by the simple expedient of inserting spacing material of some kind before the second stage direction; had (b) been the earlier state of K4 r there would have been no occasion for text to spill over into the direction line. Since the (b) state of K4 r is the corrected one, the (b) readings as a whole must represent the corrected state of sheet K. Because the corrections to K(i) involved the re-arrangement of type-pages in both formes of K some sheets already printed off had to be destroyed. From the evidence of the uncorrected state of K, K(i) was the original white-paper forme. Perfecting must have started before the need for correction was recognized, K(i)(u)+K(o) allowed to stand, the unperfected sheets of K(i)(u) discarded, and the edition total completed by printing afresh from K(i)(c)+K(o) undistributed and re-arranged. Though the direction of the change is now demonstrable, the reason for the changes is no clearer. Whatever the reason for deleting the 'black knight' lines in the first instance and then not incorporating the 'canary bird' lines at the same point (or at least confining the movement of type lines to the same forme), it was important enough to involve the destruction of perhaps half the edition number of sheet K (and yet not important enough to involve its total destruction). The indifferent nature of most of the other changes is strong presumption that they are authorial, so that by association the major change is authorial too. The consequence for the editor of City Politiques is that the (b) readings should be accepted in toto over the (a) unless good reason can be shown for not doing so. 3 This editorial obligation should be set against the practice of the only modern editor 4 of the play, John Harold Wilson, whose edition was published in 1967 in the Regents Restoration Drama Series. Wilson's text is based on a comparison of one exemplar of each of the 1683 and 1688 editions (the only editions prior to 1873), and in effect is a conflation of the two. The printer's copy for 1688 was an exemplar of 1683 with K in the uncorrected state, and Wilson's 1683 had K in the corrected state, so that 1688 appeared to him to supply lines omitted in 1683. His edition includes both the 'black knight' and 'canary bird' lines with only a record of their omission in the other edition, and it conflates 2. (a) and (b) and adopts 3. (a) without comment. 5 The demonstration of the order of the states of K also reverses the example given by Professor Bowers when writing of the assistance that a bibliographer can provide the critic by recording the full and ideal form of the various editions listed in his bibliography: 6 For example, some important alterations were made to the text of Crowne's City Politiques , 1683, while sheet K was going through the press. Since the second edition of 1688 follows the expanded form, a critic who knew only the unaltered state of sheet K in 1683 would believe that fresh authority had entered the text in 1688, whereas in truth the second edition is a mere reprint. Yet if a critic took it that in this place the 1688 edition had been authoritatively revised, he would be bound to give some possible authority to other variants elsewhere in the second edition, whereas these are in fact printer's corruptions. Professor Bowers's general position is not affected by the demonstration: 1688 remains 'a mere reprint', but the form it reprints is the 'unaltered', non-'expanded'. It is perhaps unlikely that the direction line will provide crucial evidence in resolving textual problems in more than the occasional instance. But the positive results it affords in the instance of sheet K of City Politiques —when all other tests had proved inconclusive—do at least indicate its potential value.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In (b), K3 r has a white space between the last line of text and the catch-word equal to two lines of text, K3 v beginning with a stage direction. In the same compositor's stint white space occurs between the last line of text and the catch-word when the following page begins with a stage direction on G1 r , H3 v and uncorrected I1 r . So the gap on K3 r could just as well be the compositor's normal practice as the consequence of re-arranging lines of type. 2 The reason for the abnormal length of the page in (a) is not apparent; in the same compositor's stint text in the direction line occurs on G2 r , H2 v , H4 r and I1 v , none of which are otherwise exceptional. So unless earlier states have not survived the compositor of G-L set five pages with text in the direction line. 3 If censorship could be shown to have accounted for the deletion of the 'black knight' lines then the editor might well be justified in retaining them at the expense of the 'canary bird' lines, otherwise (4. and 5. apart) printing (b) readings. An argument could perhaps be made for regarding the changes as being designed to bring the text into conformity with an authority which presumably differed from the printer's copy, in which case it could be claimed that the text ideally should include both the 'black knight' and the 'canary bird' lines, the former having been eliminated because there was insufficient room, sheet L already having been printed or imposed (there appear to be no types from K recurring in L, though types from H and I recur there). Nonetheless the case for accepting (b) readings in toto is much the strongest, lacking external evidence to the contrary. 4 Discounting Maidment and Logan, in whose Dramatic Works of John Crowne (4 vols., 1873-4) City Politiques occupies pp. 81-213 of the second volume (1873). Incredibly Maidment and Logan had never seen an exemplar of the 1683 edition and concluded, evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, that the first edition was that of 1688, which they reproduce. 5 The (a) readings deriving of course from 1688. 6 'Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Method', The Library 8 (1953), 16.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Printer's Copy for Stow's Chaucer by Bradford Y. Fletcher</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Almost two centuries ago Thomas Tyrwhitt said, "It would be a waste of time to sift accurately the heap of rubbish, which was added, by John Stowe, to the Edit. of 1561. Though we might perhaps be able to pick out two or three genuine fragments of Chaucer, we should probably find them so soiled and mangled, that he would not thank us for asserting his claim to them." 1 In the course of editing MS R.3.19 in Trinity College, Cambridge, I have had an opportunity to examine Stow's work at length and can now identify most of his printer's copy and testify to the remarkable accuracy with which he reproduced it. The 1561 Chaucer (STC 5075, 5076) is largely a bookseller's reprint of the edition of c. 1550 (STC 5071-5074). 2 At some time in the process of composition, however, John Stow assumed "editorial" duties and added to the previous edition some twenty-four poems, many, but not all, of which he attributed to Chaucer. 3 That the project was not Stow's from the beginning may be inferred from the circumstance of his being credited only at the start of the bulk of his additions and from the confusion in foliation and running titles starting at sig. 3P2 which suggests a late change of plan. Stow's contribution may well have consisted in nothing more than putting manuscripts in his possession at the disposal of the printer, Kingston. However, from the high degree of accuracy which the edition maintains (in those cases where it can be checked) it seems more likely that the "painful antiquary" maintained a close supervision of the work. In fact, only three of Stow's additions are now generally accepted as Chaucer's: "Gentilnesse," "A Complaint to His Lady," and "Chaucer's Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn"; one, "Newefangelnesse," is classed by Robinson as "almost certainly Chaucer," and one, "Proverbs," as "very doubtful indeed." 4 These twenty-four poems were (with obvious exceptions, such as The Siege of Thebes , which Stow expressly attributes to Lydgate) associated with Chaucer's name for over two hundred years until their ringing (and of course generally correct) denunciation by Tyrwhitt. The long connection of this body of verse with that of Chaucer gives it an interest beyond that generated by the intrinsic merit of the poems themselves. For instance, this is the Chaucer which Spenser knew and to which Alice S. Miskimin has recently devoted a great deal of attention in her The Renaissance Chaucer . 5 The ill repute of many of these poems is in any event surely the result of their having been unjustly maligned in an effort to dissociate them from the canon of Chaucer's (and even Lydgate's) works. 6 That Stow relied mainly on what is now Trinity College, Cambridge, MS R.3.19 (James 599; hereafter cited as t) is an assertion which has often been made, apparently on no more evidence than Stow's ownership of that volume and the large number of duplicated items. 7 More recently Greg demonstrated that many of the manuscript attributions to Chaucer and others in t derive generally from Stow, rather than vice-versa, and Gavin Bone noted in passing that the text of The Court of Love in t has been cast off for Stow's edition and the pages smudged with compositors' thumbmarks. 8 I have collated texts which Stow shares with t (as well as most of those which he shares with other manuscripts), and am thus in a position to supply further evidence. On the basis of this study it is clear that Stow did indeed print those added poems which he shares with t directly from that manuscript, without an intermediary transcription. Thus we may add one more instance to the small but growing number of manuscripts verified as sixteenth-century printer's copy. Further, as we know a manuscript source to only one other blackletter Chaucer , 9 Stow's editorial methods have particular interest. Finally, an examination of the editorial liberties of the 1561 Chaucer enables us to make at least some judgment of the textual authority of poems printed by Stow from now lost manuscripts such as the "Norfolk MS." 10 There follows a poem-by-poem discussion numbered in the order the poems appear in s. The titles are Stow's, although I have not reproduced his italics. 1. "A saying of dan Jhon." sig. 3O2 b [and] 2. "Yet of the same." 14 : 2 x RR BR 3523, 3521; Utley 387 11 Also found in: T.C.C. R.3.20 (James 600), pp. 8-9 (A Shirley MS, 1447-56, containing Stow's annotations). 12 B.M. Addit. 29729, f. 132 a (1558, belonged to Stow and in this part copied by him personally "out of the boke of John Sherley.") Stow could not have printed from 29729 as that manuscript lacks the fifth line of the first poem; there are, on the other hand, no substantive differences between his print and R.3.20 (unless line 2, oultrage [R.3.20]; outrage [s] be one), Shirley's peculiar spelling having only been modernized: e.g., 1. beoþe] bethe s, be 29729; 4,9. aage] age s 29729; 8. beon] bene s, bien 29729; 9. vnweldy] vnwildy s, vnwyldy 29729; 10. an] and s 29729; 12. phylosofres saage] Philosophers sage s, philosefers sage 29729. There are no clear signs of the printer to be found near these poems in R.3.20; thus the case for direct dependence can be no more than presumptive. As the print, however, reflects no significant spellings of 29729 and some of those in R.3.20 (though not particularly striking ones), the probability is high. 3. "Balade de bon consail." sig. 3O2 b 7 : 1 x RR BR 1419 Also found in: T.C.C. R.3.20, p. 48 (See above). B.M. Addit. 29729, f. 132 b (Following 1 and 2 after a five-line Latin proverb and a four-line Latin and English one, MacCracken, E.E.T.S. 192, p. 708). Stow's manuscript copy reads (wrongly) "In remembraunce" (line 7) where R.3.20 and s both read "The remembraunce." There are again no substantive differences between R.3.20 and s, and s does have many of the same spellings (although Shirley's ony [2] has become any and his soufraunce has become suffraunce ), so the presumption is again strong. Shirley's manuscript is almost certainly the only authority for these three poems. 4. "A balade in the Praise and sig. 3P1 b commendacion of master Geffray Chauser for his golden eloquence." 7: 1 x RR BR 2128 Also found in: T.C.C. R.3.19 (James 599), f. 25 a (=t, 1478-83, owned by Stow who has both annotated it and transcribed several of Lydgate's "Fables" into it). B.M. Harley 7333, f. 132 b (Post c. 1450-60; derived in part from a Shirley manuscript; firmly localized in Leicestershire from roughly date of writing until Harley's purchase). 13 The two manuscripts differ markedly (as reference to the Chaucer Society prints listed in BR will show) and need not be fully collated here. In t Stow has written "Chausers" next to this stanza, which in both copies follows the "Parlament of Foules." Stow's print differs from t only in the following substantives: Title t Verba Translatoris] see above for s) 1. t Chausers] chauser s 2. T port] Poet s 3,4. s ins. "to" before verb. All of these are obvious corrections by Stow. The bulk of Stow's additions begins at the end of the volume at 3P2 a under the heading: "¶ Here foloweth certaine woorkes of Geffray Chauser, whiche hath not here tofore been printed, and are gathered and added to this booke by Jhon Stowe." It is only an assumption, although a reasonable one, that Stow also added the four fillers discussed above. 5. "A balade made by Chaucer, teching what is gentilnes, or whom is worthy to be caled gentil." sig. 3P2 a 21 : 3 x RR (Ballade) BR 3348 Most of the eleven authorities are quickly eliminated by cursory collation except: B.M. Cotton Cleopatra D.vii, f. 188 b B.M. Harley 7578, f. 17 a Brusendorff suggests in one place that Stow's text agrees with Cleo., in another that it is from a manuscript similar to the "Bradshaw Group" (the above plus B.M. Addit. 22139). 14 Pace says Stow prints from Cleo. "or a comparable lost MS." 15 Stow's print differs from both Harley and Cleo. by adding a title and by reading dreis for dresse (line 3), not for nought (13, spelling only), weare for were (14, spelling only), and is for hem (20, s in error); in the five places where Stow differs from Harley he agrees with Cleo.: where Harley reads strooke , they read stoke (s) or stocke (Cleo.) (line 1, Harley in error), where Harley reads Most they read Must (line 3, Harley in error), where Harley reads Vices , they read Vicesse (15, spelling), they read vertues where Harley reads vertouse (17), and they both retain the Explicit lacking in Harley. On the other hand, s and Harley agree against Cleo. only in maintaining the proper order of words in the refrain to the first stanza, something for which the other two stanzas of Cleo. could serve as witness were s copied from Cleo. On balance then, it seems very likely that s was copied from Cleo., and for textual purposes there is no profit to be gained from the hypothesis of a "comparable lost MS," but see the discussion of Poem 7, below. 6. "A Prouerbe agaynst couitise and negligence." sig. 3P2 a 8 : 2 x 4abab BR 3914 The only similar copies are in: Fairfax 16, f. 195 b (c.1450, has Stow's notes). Harley 7578, f. 20 a [Addit 16165, f. 246 b is clearly much unlike these]. George Pace has recently discussed the textual relations and has assigned independent value to s. 16 However, he bases his case on what seems to me inadequate evidence. Apart from titles, there are only two substantive variants among these three texts: 6. s myne] my FH; 7. H Who] Whoo so Fs. Pace errs in reading cher (8) in s; s reads, with all the others, ther , the t being poorly inked. 17 The turned n in distreine (rime word in line 8) seems to me of no significance. H's reading in line 7 eliminates it as a likely source of s. There is no such evidence to eliminate F as s's source. It is certainly worth pointing out, however, that the two poems which follow in s are also in F, and that s clearly does not depend on F for them. 7. "A balade whiche Chaucer made agaynst women vnconstaunt" sig. 3P2 a [Newefangelnesse] 21 : 3 x RR (Ballade) BR 2029; Utley 175 Found also in: Fairfax 16, ff. 194 b -195 a (see above) Harley 7578, f. 17 b Cotton Cleopatra, D.vii, 189 b None of these three is a likely source for s. Harley omits youre (line 2), a (12), and where s and Cleo. read ye to liue haue space , Harley has I have lyue &amp; space , and Fairfax has ye have lyves space (4). Fairfax varies independently in reading that throgh for for (1), omitting ye (2), reading thing for thinges and ay so for euer (6), and ye may well for thus may ye (7), to use the first stanza as an example. For its part, Cleo. omits al (14, 21), your (15), and reads Tandace for Candace (16). Stow varies from all the manuscripts by omitting that (11), so in eure so kene (6), and the second ye in line 19. It seems safe to say from this sampling that while s is related to Cleo. D.vii, it is certainly not copied from it and must thus be accorded independent status. This conclusion casts some doubt on the discussion of Poem 5, above. 8. "Here foloweth a balade whiche Chaucer made in þe praise or sig. 3P2 a-b rather dispraise, of women for ther doublenes." 104 : 13 x MkT BR 3656; Utley 307 Since Ashmole 59 (Shirley, 1447-56) lacks stanzas eight and ten and is wildly variant (being probably a memorial reconstruction made in extreme age), B.M. Addit. 16165 (Shirley, bef. Ashmole) omits stanza eight, and Harley 7578 omits line seven, none could have been Stow's source. 18 The only remaining manuscript is Fairfax 16, ff. 199 a -199* b The following table collates those readings where s varies from Fairfax. Fairfax's reading is taken as lemma. 9. these] that s (probable error) 18. is shene] ishene s (error) 21. who so] who s 28. no] non s 29. So] That s (and the rest) 30. abytte] abieth s 34.

"This werke folowinge was compiled by Chaucer and is caled sig. 3P3 a-b the craft of louers." 161 : 23 x RR BR 3761 The copies in Harley 2251 and Additional 34360 (both by the same scribe; Temp. Edw. IV) have three extra stanzas at the end, and in addition join in substantive variation from t and s about ninety times, aligning with s against t only in a few clear corrections (e.g., 99, 144); see also Harley 2251 in line 107. The only other manuscript is: t, ff. 154 b -156 a (see above, Poem 4). That s was set up directly from t is indicated by the notation "q 4" at the head of the poem and by smudges of printer's ink at the bottoms of ff. 154 b and 155 a in addition to the close agreement of their texts. Stow has written "The Craft of lovers chaucers" at the head of f. 154 b , and next to the date 1448 in the last stanza has noted "Chaucer died. 1400." Instead of thinking that the date invalidated his firm attribution, he did the reverse and changed the date in the print to 1348. Although all three manuscripts contain his hand, he does not seem to have used any but t. A. S. G. Edwards and J. Hedley argue ( SB , 28 [1975], 267) that Stow may have adopted "a few readings from either the Additional or Harley manuscripts." Although it is an attractive idea and is barely possible that Stow did look to one of these manuscripts when in doubt, in the five places where he joins them against t (vv. 3, 46, 99, 107, &amp; 144; I take v. 55 to be merely spelling, and their reading of v. 61 is in error), the substitutions are so easily explained as to be very likely coincidental. The readings of vv. 99 and 144 are obvious corrections of obvious errors; and such readings as ben for be or to for unto hardly seem the sort for which one would bother to go to another manuscript. There is more sense in asserting that Stow went to another manuscript to explain "dedeyn / To haue pyte on me." This form, which means deign , is chiefly northern and relatively rare. (See MED , s.v., disdein, n.4; OED , s.v. dedeign.) The meter seems to indicate that dedeyn is both original and correct, and it is at least as likely that Stow picked up the much easier reading from A or H as that he arrived at it independently. It is most probable that A and H, which are in the same careless hand, and t were all copied from a lost exemplar. That the two scribes worked together is seen by the presence of both hands together T.C.C. R.3.21.

["In the season of Feuerere"] sig. 3P5 a-b 49 : 7 x RR BR 1562 Unique to t, f. 160 a (following Poem 13 directly) There is no printer's notation by this poem in t, however the margin has been cropped (almost certainly since Stow's time 19 ) eliminating the ends of a few words and all the outside margin.

Harley 2251, ff. 149 b -150 a (See Poem 9, above). There is an ink smudge at the foot of f. 207 b in t.

Stow was almost certainly set up from t. 20. "These verses next folowing were compiled by Geffray sig. 3Q1 a-b Chauser and in the writen copies foloweth at the ende of the complainte of petee." 177: various stanza forms misunderstood in all copies. BR 3414 B.M. Addit. 34360, ff. 51 a -53 a (see Poem 9, above). B.M. Harley 78, ff. 82 a -83 b (these leaves in Shirley's hand). Harley 78 is a composite volume put together by Stow; 21 Addit. 34360 was also once in his hands. Skeat and later Brusendorff suggest that s cannot be derived from H because of readings in lines 12 (where s agrees with A) and 94 (where s varies alone in a manner Brusendorff thinks characteristic of Shirley) and the position of lines 88-89 at the end of a stanza (as in A) when they should begin one were s following H. 22 Brusendorff hypothesizes a lost Shirleian codex on this evidence together with that supplied by the unique Shirleian texts preserved in Stow's partially holograph Addit. 29729. With reference to this poem, such an hypothesis is unlikely on its face. True, Stow's print retains Shirleian spellings (as do both manuscripts), 23 but it varies from H only twenty-some times in 117 lines, and the majority of these are trivial or obvious errors, and Shirley is famous as a copyist whose versions of individual poems differ from each other markedly. 24 Thirteen of Stow's variations are obvious trivial errors or are not clearly substantive (lines 1, 11, 31, 32, 40, 50, 54, 55, 91, 96, 99, and 102 in the collation below), and the rest can all be read as emendations which modernize H, make it more explicit, improve its rime, and even reflect inability to read Shirley's hand (lines 12, 56, 67, 82, 94, 107, 109, and 110). It therefore seems most likely that s and A were both copied from H, the copy in A being made before that fragment lost the leaf containing the final stanza, as A is the sole authority for it. To suppose otherwise would require the unlikely coincidence that both H and the lost Shirley thought to be Stow's source each contained the final stanza on a separate leaf and each lost that leaf. The argument that the assignment of lines 88-89 to the end of a stanza in sA and to the beginning of one in H requires the hypothesis of a lost manuscript is invalidated by the presence in H of early corrections (not noted in the Chaucer Society transcriptions) which bring H's stanza form into accord with sA. It is not unreasonable to suppose that these corrections antedate both A and s. There remain to be considered only three readings in which s and A agree against H. In line 12, where H reads "wight þat wil me woe byreve," sA both read ". . . my wo . . . ." "My" seems the temptingly easier reading, as the MED cites only H as evidence for a double object in this sense, s.v., bireven, 3.c. In line 82 sA join in reading "loueth" where H has "leueþe," but inspection of H makes clear that Shirley's "e" and his "o" are much alike and in the particular instance a misreading of "o" for "e" is easy; A makes the same error again in line 112. Finally in line 117 both s and A normalize to a dominant form which even occurs elsewhere in the same line. Thus, although there has been no casting off for the printer in H that I can see now on film, it is reasonable to suggest that s was in fact set up from it, particularly in the light of such misreadings as that in line 82. Except for the final stanza, where we must rely on the generally poor work of the scribe of A, 25 H is our sole authority for the poem. In the collation which follows, H provides the lemma. 1. creature] reature s (trivial) 2. as] om. A 11. and] an s leve] love A 12. me woo] my wo sA (see text) 21. I see] om.

There is also an arrow at line fourteen which begins column two in s. These seem sufficient evidence that s was copied from t.

"The Court of Loue." sig. 3Q2 a -3R3 a 1422 : 206 x RR BR 4205 Unique to t, ff. 217 a -234 b As noted above, Bone discovered that t was cast off as copy fors. 27 There is no need to rehearse his evidence here in detail. There are two series of pencil marks, one correcting the other so that the poem ends evenly at the foot of a page. Bone also mentions markings "for an edition with exactly forty-nine lines (seven stanzas) to a page—an edition which I have been unable to trace. . . . [These markings] look late and I should not like to base any conclusion on them. They may even be preliminary calculation for the edition of 1561." Bone's last guess is undoubtedly correct. s has precisely seven stanzas to the column, where the arrangement is not upset by a large initial or title. The "k" which Bone notes on f. 229 b against stanza 139 is a poorly made "R" and indicates where the 3R gathering would have begun had fourteen lines been used for the title and three large initials in the preceding text. In fact, twenty-one lines were so used, so 3R starts with stanza 138. We need look no longer for an edition in seven-stanza pages. While Stow reproduces many clear manuscript errors, his print is remarkable for the very small number of new errors introduced. In the following collation, readings which are clear errors in either copy are designated by an asterisk; 28 generally the list is confined to clearly substantive variation. Stow's reading follows that of t, and the line numbering of the Oxford Chaucer is used where there is any ambiguity. 8. blosmes] blosomes s 36. myne] my s 37. to] to to* s 57. be] by s 63. thaim] than* s 77. stone] stones s 97. discrive] descrie* s 130. seen] sen s 143. weneth*] wõneth* s 150.

There are no certain printer's marks in the manuscript; therefore we can no more than presume, as in numbers one and two, on the basis of verbal closeness and historical possibility that Stow copies from it.

In their final opinion s is an independent authority, which, however, shows conflation, particularly in the first four hundred lines, from de Worde. 29 I have not had the opportunity to collate all of the seven manuscripts which have come to light since 1929. St. John's 256 can be ruled out as it was copy for de Worde and is followed relatively closely by him. 30 Boston Public Library 94 is not similar to s, a cursory collation shows. This leaves Morgan 4, 31 Durham Cosin V. ii.14, University of Texas, Austin ( olim Brudenell, olim Cardigan), 32 Coventry Corp. Record Office, 33 and olim Campbell. Should one of these manuscripts reveal itself as the primary source for s, we shall be in the very interesting position of being able to chronicle the process of conflation for all but those parts of the poem missing in de Worde through loss of three leaves in the unique copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">General Comments Throughout Stow's print, spelling is modernized and to some slight extent regularized. For instance, he regularly prints "i" for vocalic "y," regularizes somewhat the use of "u" and "v," adds or deletes final "e" (with no discernible system), doubles single consonants (and vice versa), regards "o" and "ou," "e" and "ea," and "ai" and "ey" as equivalent. All these changes are very much as might be expected and are, of course, very unlikely to represent Stow's personal influence. Less expected is the generally high substantive accuracy of his print. In the 2170 lines of verse which Stow took from t, he varies substantively less than 200 times. In three or fourscore cases he corrects clear errors in t, and in a slightly smaller number of cases he introduces errors of his own which distort the text. We are therefore justified in placing considerable reliance on the texts in Stow which are independent, and may assume that his print of the Norfolk manuscript is faithful. This high degree of accuracy coupled with the vague nature of the directions to the printer in t suggests that Stow was in very close contact with the printer's shop, perhaps even present during the actual composition. There are very few places where emendations have been supplied in t in a hand even remotely resembling Stow's (e.g., Poem 16, line 7). The hypothesis of such close contact fits well with the way in which the poems seem to have been added. After having introduced the first four poems (28 lines in all) as fillers, he adds four poems from (probably) various manuscripts. He then takes up t to print two poems which occur together amongst the eighteen in the first fascicle, two poems from the three in the seventh fascicle (omitting La Belle Dame sans Mercy , already in Thynne), and four poems which occur sequentially in the first fascicle (omitting BR 1838 which borrows heavily from the Craft of Lovers , already printed). He then jumps to the tenth fascicle and prints three of its nine poems (omitting Lydgate's Horns , which comes between the second and the third). Then, after adding "A Complaint to his Lady" (Poem 20) from the leaves which are now bound in Harley 78, he notes a space to be filled before the beginning of the Court of Love , which on account of its size was surely set up separately, and fills it with another poem from the first fascicle of roughly correct size. There remained only one more filler from R.3.20 and the Siege (which was also surely set up separately). Stow demonstrates some sophistication by returning to T.C.C. R.3.20 rather than using his own copy of that manuscript in the case of poems one through three. I can find no evidence that his textual sophistication extended to collation as a basis for stop press corrections however. Such corrections as my selective check of STC 5076 reveals appear to be the result of no more than a haphazard reading for sense. It would be unreasonable to expect more of Stow than the enlightened fidelity which he already gives his manuscript sources. Similarly, there is no convincing evidence that Stow went to secondary manuscripts (except possibly in the case of Thebes according to Erdmann and Ekwall) to supply readings which his own invention could give him. In the case of Poems 9 and 20, for instance, he does not pick up extra stanzas at the ends of the copies in manuscripts he is known to have been acquainted with. Of the poems in t Stow has generally chosen the more courtly and secular to include as Chaucer's. He seems to have had some notion forty years before the publication of his Lydgate canon in Speght's Chaucer of what sort of verse was Lydgate's, as he carefully avoids almost a dozen of Lydgate's poems in t. But whether he actually believed that all the poems he attributes to Chaucer in his blanket heading were his is a question which remains unanswered. On subjective grounds I am inclined to believe that we may understand that the careful historian had in mind the notion "school of Chaucer." To sum up the state of our knowledge with regard to Stow's additions, we may say with confidence that fourteen of them were taken directly from t (4, 9-19, and 21-22), with reasonable certainty that four were taken from T.C.C. R.3.20 (1-3, and 23), and with less certainty that one each was taken from Cotton Cleopatra D.vii (5), Fairfax 16 (6), and Harley 78 (20). Finally, in two cases (7, 8) Stow's print is certainly itself an authority and one (24) awaits a further investigation.</field>

Note that s is the only authority for several words and word endings, due to the plowing. 20 The former adds a stanza and inserts a "b" line between each pair of "c" lines, creating MKT stanzas. See A. G. Rigg, A Glastonbury Miscellany (1968), pp. 59-60. R. A. Klinefelter has discussed the English College MS in MLQ , 14 (1953), 3-6. He dates it 1436-56 and notes that its readings "seem close" to t and Harley 2251 (which do not to me seem to be particularly close themselves). Associations suggest that the MS was brought to Rome in the 1550's and has remained there since. R. H. Robbins, Neophilologus , 39 (1955), 132, dates the MS "second half XV century," and corrects some of the associations, but the supposition that the MS was in Rome and therefore not available to Stow is still justified. I have not examined the MS, and its text of this poem is unpublished; a full collation of Harley 2251, t and s is given below as an aid to classification of the Rome MS. 21 See A. I. Doyle, "An Unrecognized Piece of Piers the Ploughman's Creed and Other Work by its Scribe," Speculum , 34 (1959), 428-436. 22 Oxf. Ch., I, 526; Brusendorff, Tradition , pp. 225-226. Skeat believed that A was a copy of H, while Brusendorff proposes yet another lost Shirley as A's exemplar. 23 One might add to Brusendorff's list "elas" (="alas") in line 86. 24 See Hammond, Manual , pp. 515-517, and references there cited. 25 For instance, in the 182 lines of The Craft of Lovers found in two of his MSS (Harley 2251, Addit. 34360) he varies from himself 37 times. 26 This stanza, which is not identified in Utley or BR, was drawn, as was the rest of the poem, from the Fall of Princes , III, 77-84, as noted by Hammond, Manual , p. 415. It is tenuously connected with the rest of the poem. 27 One may add to Bone's description the observation, made independently by A. I. Doyle and myself, that the scribe of the Court , who is not the main scribe of t, is the same as that of St. John's, Oxon, MS 256, a Siege of Thebes which Bone deals with extensively as printer's copy for the de Worde, c. 1495 edition (STC 17031). He seems to have been associated with the scribe of t and that of Addit. 34360 as one of the men to continue Shirley's business. 28 Of course all of Stow's variations, other than the correction of obvious errors, are errors in a sense; I allow him a middle ground of justifiable emendation, however. 29 Axel Erdmann and Eilert Ekwall, Lydgate's Siege of Thebes , E.E.T.S., e. s., 108 (text), &amp; 125 (notes), especially 125, pp. 80-82. 30 See nn. 8, 27, above. Bone does not, unfortunately, give variant readings for Thebes . His plates however show a portion of the text where copy and print agree very closely. 31 Related to Pepys 2011 and Christchurch 152 according to C. F.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printer of the First Quarto of Astrophil and Stella (1591) by MacD. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sidney's sonnet sequence was first printed in a Quarto of 1591: the publisher was Thomas Newman, but the printer has not hitherto been identified, even by William A. Ringler, who remarks that the unknown tradesman "had good reason to keep his name and device from the title-page." 1 The Quarto is of little significance for the construction of a critical edition, for "its publication was unauthorized and its text is extremely corrupt;" 2 it evidently derives from the least satisfactory of three lost intermediaries between Sidney's original and the twenty-six early manuscripts and prints in which the sequence is, in whole or in part, preserved. However, it is of historical interest, at the very least, to identify the printer for Newman's piratical venture. He was, in fact, John Charlewood, whose printing-house was fairly productive during the period 1558-1595, and who printed at least four books for Thomas Newman and Thomas Gubbin in 1587-1595. 3 The crucial evidence is the highly distinctive head-piece to Sig. B1 r of the Astrophil and Stella Quarto, a head-piece which reappears on Sig. B2 r of The Approved Order of Martial Discipline , written by Giles Clayton and printed by I(ohn) C(harlewood) for Abraham Kitsonne in 1591 ( STC 5376). There are several other typographical links between the two volumes. The title-pages employ in the same way the decorative six-point star and three dots within parentheses. The fleurons heading A2 r of Astrophil and Stella likewise head A2 r and L2 r of The Approved Order . The fig-leaf type is used several times in both volumes. The two fleurons centred above the imprint on the title-page of Astrophil and Stella are used in exactly the same manner in The Approved Order on H1 r , the title-page to the Second Part (where the star in parentheses is again to be found); these fleurons appear in series on G3 r and I3 v of Astrophil and Stella ; two are used in association with different fleurons on L4 r of The Approved Order . Several of these forms of ornamentation also link Astrophil and Stella with the Quarto of Daniel's Delia ( STC 6253), which John Charlewood printed for Simon Waterson in 1592 (see especially A2 r of each volume), with A Pathway to Military Practice ( STC 20995) by Barnabe Rich, printed by Charlewood for Robert Walley in 1587, with The Second Part of the Book of Christian Exercise ( STC 19380) by Robert Parsons, printed by Charlewood for Simon Waterson in 1590, and with The Royal Exchange ( STC 12307) by Robert Greene, printed by Charlewood for William Wright in 1590. Bibliographically the Quarto is of some interest. It collates A-L 4 , with Sheet A devoted to title-page and preliminaries. The recto section of the running-title is invariably "Astrophel and Stella" but even a casual glance reveals a change in the versos from "Sir P.S. his" or "Sir P.S. hys" in sheets B-E to "Syr P.S. his" in sheets F-L. Upon careful inspection of the headlines it becomes clear that one skeleton imposed B(i), B(o), E(i), and E(o), and another skeleton imposed C(i), C(o), D(i), and D(o); two new skeletons were used for sheets F-L: although there are some minor alterations and anomalies among the headlines, it appears that one skeleton imposed G(i), G(o), I(i), I(o), L(i), and L(o), and another skeleton imposed F(i), F(o), H(i), H(o), K(i), and K(o). Various features of spelling and typography confirm a bibliographical division between sheets E and F. Comparatively small capitals almost always head sonnets in sheets B-E; sheets F-L employ a mixture of large and small capitals. Stopped signatures in A-E give way to unstopped signatures in F-L (except for G1 r , H1 r and L1 r ). The word "eye" occurs just under one hundred times in the volume and the pronoun "her" nearly two hundred times: in sheets B-E the spelling eye is invariable, but thereafter eie is also used frequently; within sheets B-E the spelling her is invariable, but thereafter hir is frequent. The spellings hee, shee, mee, wee , and bee become more frequent in the later sheets. The distribution of eye|eie and her|hir spellings within sheets F-L suggests that two compositors set this part of the text: there is a definite tendency for eie and hir to be associated. And the distribution of smaller and larger capitals at the beginning of sonnets implies setting by formes, at least in F. Whether or not the single compositor who appears to have set sheets A-E was one of the two men involved in setting the remaining sheets is hard to determine—the pattern of stopping of signatures (27 stops for 15 signatures in A-E, 3 stops for 18 signatures in F-L) would suggest not. The bibliographical peculiarities of the Quarto are, as I have said, of little consequence textually. But one small point is worth making. The Quarto must be numbered among descendants of a lost manuscript which Ringler designates Z. Ringler calculates, however, that the Quarto contains about 6 per cent more error than Z itself, "which indicates either that it was printed with almost unbelievable carelessness, or more probably that it descends from Z through one or more carelessly executed intermediaries" (p. 452). Ringler's belief that the latter is the more plausible explanation of the Quarto's extreme corruption is supported by the fact that both the main bibliographical sections, sheets A-E and F-L, display this corruption in the same manner and degree: errors peculiar to the Quarto are not significantly more common in the earlier or later half of the book. Nor does the second section itself vary in quality in accordance with the compositorial pattern which it exhibits. That three compositors could all have set the text "with almost unbelievable carelessness" is, I submit, too great a strain on credulity.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"Wife" or "Wise"— The Tempest 1. 1786 by Jeanne Addison Roberts</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The vicissitudes of one textual reading in the history of the evolution of Shakespeare's text can sometimes reveal in a particularly vivid and interesting way the pressures, often conflicting, of literary judgments and bibliographical study. Such a history is especially enlightening in cases where it is possible to trace some sort of progress toward a correct conclusion. I believe we are now in a position to do this in the case of a much-debated passage in The Tempest . As Ferdinand watches the masque produced by Prospero and Ariel in celebration of his promised marriage to Miranda, he says, according to most copies of the First Folio, Let me liue here euer, So rare a wondred Father, and a wife Makes this place Paradife (IV.i.123-25, ll. 1785-87). 1 This reading was copied by the second, third, and fourth Folios. However, "wise" was emended by Nicholas Rowe in 1709 to "wife," presumably on literary grounds—to improve the sense—and without any textual evidence other than the fact of the easy confusion of "f" and long "s." His "wife" was the preferred reading throughout the eighteenth century, and Edmond Malone (1790) changed "Makes" to "Make" in order to effect subject-verb agreement. The first evidence of an effort to restore the usual Folio reading came in 1842 from John Payne Collier, who re-emended to "wise," noting that "This is the reading of every old copy, from which modern editors have varied, without notice, by printing wife for 'wise,' and Make for 'Makes.' It needs no proof that 'So rare a wonder'd father, and a wise,' was the phraseology of Shakespeare's time." However, in 1853, on the authority of his own forged Ms annotations in the "hand-corrected folio of 1632," Collier returned to the eighteenth-century precedent of "wife" and "Make," explaining the error of the Folios by saying "The f was mistaken by the compositor for the long s . . ." Other nineteenth-century editors vacillated similarly. Charles Knight printed "wife" in 1838-43 and "wise" in his second edition, 1842-44. In neither case did he explain. Alexander Dyce reversed the order of change, printing "wise" without explanation in 1858 but substituting "wife" in his 1864-67 edition in spite of his note that the Folio readings do not support the change. Samuel Weller Singer opted for "wife" in 1862, repeating it in 1856, though acknowledging, like Knight, that "all the old copies" read "wise." Henry N. Hudson, James O. Halliwell, and Richard Grant White, in their editions of 1851-56, 1853-65, and 1857-66 respectively, were the first to insist consistently on "wise." Hudson had no note, but one supposes that all three editors were moved by a desire to restore the original text. White explained simply that "Malone and the corrector of Mr. Collier's folio of 1632 changed 'wise' to wife and 'makes' to make ." In the face of editorial uncertainty about which reading to choose, Halliwell conceded that the two words were often confused, but he decided to retain the "original" reading. He was the first to attempt to back his choice with a sophisticated literary justification. Halliwell said of the passage, "The whole is a compliment to the powers of Prospero, so that I think the conjecture of wife for wise , first suggested by Rowe, and adopted by many editors, scarcely necessary." Agreeing with Hudson, White, and Halliwell about the merits of "wise," but unwilling to drop Miranda from the sense of the passage, Howard Staunton, in his 1858-60 edition, rewrote the lines to read So rare a wonder, and a father wise, Makes this place Paradise. Staunton introduced for the first time the implied suggestion that the word "wonder" might be linked here to Miranda's name. This suggestion was later repeated by other editors and readers who chose "wise" but were reluctant to exclude Miranda from the import of the speech. The list includes Richard L. Ashhurst, who spelled the implication out in detail, saying "I see no reason to change the Text, although I think Mr. Staunton's ingenious emendation . . . points us to the true rendering of the passage. The Wonder must refer I think to Miranda, emphatically the Wonder of the play . . . . Miranda must be the chief cause of Ferdinand's finding the Island a Paradise. 'So rare a wondered father,' meaning father of so rare a wonder, or father blest in the possession of a daughter who is so rare a wonder, though inverted and obscure, is hardly beyond the limits of poetic license. . . . This reading has at least the merit of adherence to the canon, keeping the text unchanged while it does not make Ferdinand guilty of omitting among his inducements to live forever on the Isle, the Goddess on whom these airs attend." Moved by the same impulse, John Dover Wilson (New Cambridge, 1921), G. L. Kittredge (1936), and Frank Kermode (New Arden, 1954) also mentioned in their editions that "wondred" is a possible reference to Miranda. To bolster his arguments Staunton pointed finally to the rhyme. Even though it occurs in the middle of a line in an unexpected position in a blank verse passage, he concluded "that the lines were intended to rhyme," citing similar rhymes (not similarly placed in mid-line) in The Passionate Pilgrim and Love's Labour's Lost . 2 The literary argument was continued at some length in the Minutes of the Philadelphia Shakespeare Society for May 30th, 1865. Asa I. Fish pointed out quite rightly that the singular verb does not reliably support "wise" because "singular verbs and plural nominatives are too frequent in the F 1 to found and determine a reading." He nonetheless concluded on the basis of the society's discussion that "either reading may stand . . . but the weight of the authority is in favour of 'wise.'" Richard Ashhurst at the same meeting, after elaborating on Miranda as the "wonder" ended with, "The reading of wife for "wise" . . . seems to me very tame indeed." In the 1892 Variorum, H. H. Furness recorded his own preference for "wise." John Dover Wilson added an imaginative fillip to his choice of the "wise" reading which emphasizes Prospero over Miranda, "The whole may be interpreted as a compliment to King James." The editors (William G. Clark, John Glover, and William Aldis Wright) of the various Cambridge editions (1863-66, 1867, and 1891-95) and the Globe (Clark and Wright, 1864) chose "wife" (see below), but Wright editing alone (1874) preferred "wise," saying, "Both readings of course yield an excellent sense, but it must be admitted that . . . wife seems to bring Ferdinand from his rapture back to earth again. He is lost in wonder at Prospero's magic power. It may be objected in this case Miranda is left out altogether, but the use of the word 'father' shows that Ferdinand regarded her as one with himself." Kittredge (1936), Peter Alexander (1951), Anne Righter (Anne Barton, New Penguin 1968) Irving Ribner (revision of Kittredge, 1966), Northrop Frye (New Pelican, 1970), and G. B. Evans (Riverside, 1974) all printed "wise" in their editions. Perhaps the most curious of the literary discussions of the merits of the two readings is that of Morton Luce in the Arden edition of 1901. After printing "wise," he commented in his note, "If we have to strike a balance between the readings "wise" and "wife," it should be in favour of "wife," for the rhyme of Paradise with wise is a blemish, and it could hardly have been intentional." Miranda "surely would help to make the place a Paradise." Kermode's New Arden (1954) wavered similarly, printing "wise," but commenting, "We may think that, in this Adam-like situation, Ferdinand must have said wife ; and the rhyme is unexpected. . . . In any case f:f is an easy misprint, and the true reading may be wife after all." While these battles raged on the literary front (and it is noteworthy that all the arguments came from editors and readers who preferred "wise"—even though they supposed themselves firmly buttressed by the authority of the Folio text), an important new bibliographical fact was revealed in the notes to the first Cambridge edition (1863-66). The text prints "wife," citing the authority of a variant reading of F1 as well as Rowe. The siglum for the alternative "wise" reads correctly, "F1 (var.), F2, F3, F4." The information that copies of the Folio differ was frequently repeated, but very little use was made of it, perhaps because copies of the Folio with the clear reading "wife" are rare and their location was not known. 3 The most careful recorded study of the problem is Fish's in 1865. Noting that "It appears that copies of the first folio here differ," he reported the negative results of his own research: "The copy of the first folio in the British Museum, the one at the Bridgewater House, and the eight copies used by Mr. Booth in collating his elegant reprint just finished all read 'wise,' if the photograph and the facsimile reprint may be trusted. The reprint of 1807 also reads 'wise;' so does Mr. Forrest's copy of the First Folio, the only one in this city; so does the copy in the Astor Library in New York. If the collation of the Camb. Edd. is to be relied on, the remaining folios all read 'wise.'" In spite of not finding the evidence, Fish accepted the idea that a press variant existed, concluding, "but which reading first appeared can never be known." Furness quoted Fish, but in his textual note gave "wise" as the reading of "Ff." He added his own commentary note: "In my copy of the First Folio the letter which is to make a wise wife or a wife wise is of such a doubtful shape that no one, I think, would be willing to decide which end o' th' beam should bow. Personally, seeing that I much prefer wise , I incline to believe that it is 'wise' in my copy." Evans' Riverside note on his "wise" reading said simply " some copies of F 1 may read wife." The current state of knowledge is best summed up by Kermode, who says, "It has long been on record that some copies of F read wife , but no editor of the play seems to have examined such a copy, though other variant readings in the Folio text of the play are amply vouched for." In The Printing and Proofreading of the First Folio (1963), Charlton Hinman recorded no press variant at this point of the text, nor indeed in the forme in which the passage occurs (B2, B5v). In my own collation of the forme in the Folger copies not collated by Hinman, 4 I discovered no sign of press variants. However, a check of all the Folger Shakespeare Library Folios 5 does reveal two clear examples of "wife," one in a copy not collated by Hinman, #73 (see fig. 1.), and one in a copy included in his collation, #6 (see fig. 2). Examination of these copies under high-intensity light makes it clear that the "f's" are not inked in by hand. Other "f's" with outlines less clear because of damage on the right side of the crossbar appear in #'s 2, 12, 18, 54, and 62. Among copies in which the letter looks like long "s," there are at least twelve cases of what appear to be fragments of a broken crossbar on the right side of the letter. The possibility that this situation can be attributed to a stop-press correction is so slight that I think it can be ruled out altogether, not only because of the progressive deterioration of the letter, but also because no other variants appear in the forme. As for press-correction, if the original reading was "wife," the meaning was obvious and there would have been no reason to question it—certainly not to consult copy, for the line reads sensibly. If the original reading was "wise," the relative rarity of copies reading "wife" would force us to suppose that the correction was made toward the end of the press run, with presses stopped to alter only one word in the forme, and a word which was already acceptable—again an almost inconceivable procedure. Much more acceptable is the theory which is supported by a close look at the evidence—that the letter began as an "f" and broke in the process of printing. Enlarged and superimposed photographs of various copies reveal general co-incidence of the outlines of the letter, except for the crossbar, and absolutely no disturbance in the setting of the line (cf. figs. 1 and 3). The only satisfactory conclusion is that the letter, originally an "f," was bent or broken in the process of printing, thus transforming the original "wife" to "wise" (see fig. 3). Some signs of the progress of this change may be seen in intermediate copies (see fig. 4). The rarity of the clear "wife" reading in extant Folios indicates that the letter broke early in the process of printing. The odds against an accidental change in the shape of a letter creating another letter, and that change in turn creating a word still acceptable in the sense of the line, and adding a rhyme where none existed before are great, but the fact that all this could have been occasioned by one small physical change makes it a much more acceptable explanation than the alternative hypothesis of stop-press correction. In the presence of such accidents the literary imagination is almost helpless. Sound editorial principles may be equally misleading. The history of textual editing of this passage of The Tempest shows that Rowe's simple obvious emendation, based, we may suppose, on the logical expectation that Miranda would have been as necessary as Prospero in Ferdinand's Paradise, turns out to have been accurate textual strategy. 6 Bibliographical "progress," in so far as it was based on partial knowledge, was actually regress; and the literary judgments of critics and editors are revealed as ingenious but useless flounderings. Although discouraging, the slow pace of progress is not enough to make us resolve, like Prospero, to drown our books; rather in this case we have new occasion to celebrate Henry Clay Folger's careful preservation of a large number of books in the collection that makes the solution to such a problem possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Through line numbers refer to The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare , ed. Charlton Hinman, 1968. Globe act, scene, and line numbers are also given. 2 John Dover Wilson noted a number of "traces of rhymed couplets" in The Tempest , which he took as signs that Shakespeare was adapting an old play. In the lines he points out, however, (e.g. 1282-3, 1269-70) the rhymes are either both internal or both at the ends of lines. 3 Interestingly F. J. Furnivall reprinted in his reduced facsimile of 1895 a copy of the Folio with a damaged but recognizable "f," and his parallel text read "wife." However, no one seems to have pursued the implications. He himself printed "wise" in his 1909 Old Spelling edition, with the siglum "F. Some copies wife. Rowe, Cam. A ryme [sic] is evidently meant." 4 See Hinman, I, 246n. for list of Folios not collated. B2 is missing in copies # 40, 64, and 74. 5 Folger copies # 9, 14, and 15 were not checked since they are part of traveling exhibitions and not available in the library. Mr. Carey S. Bliss, Curator of Rare Books at The Huntington Library, reports that all four Folios in that library read "wise." 6 The possibility that Rowe saw "wife" in a copy of the First Folio, though remote, cannot be absolutely ruled out. (Folger Folio #73 is thought to have belonged to Thomas Killigrew, father and son.) There is no evidence that Rowe ever saw the First Folio in any copy. He did restore a number of readings which occurred only in that edition, but this can be attributed to chance or good editorial judgment. In his dedication to the Duke of Somerset he says he compared "the several editions" without specifying which ones.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printer's Copy for the 1785 Variorum Shakespeare by William C. Woodson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Volume 28 of Studies in Bibliography I concluded, primarily from the internal evidence of Macbeth , that the 1785 Variorum edition of Shakespeare was not simply a reprint of the 1778 edition. I have since discovered the printer's copy for most of the plays in the 1785 edition, in the British Library, catalogued as another copy of the 1778 Variorum (shelf mark C.117.e.3). Its ten volumes, however, are not uniform with the ten of the 1778 edition, and contain in fact only 29 of the plays. With this prepared copy it is possible to reach more precise conclusions regarding the scope and genesis of the 1785 edition, while its place in the quarrel of the editors perhaps can now be reassessed. To begin, there can be no doubt that the 1785 edition was a considerable revision of the 1778 Variorum. The plays to be sure did not all equally attract the abilities of the editors and commentators, but even those plays which are only slightly modified may have substantive or semi-substantive textual emendations. The plays may be classified as being lightly, moderately, or heavily revised, with a lower limit suggested by 2 Henry VI , with 40 changes in the commentary and 3 in the text, and an upper range by Macbeth , with 170 changes, 9 of which affect the text. 1 Commentary notes were sent to Isaac Reed or George Steevens by Malone, Whalley, Henley, Henderson, Mason, and Reynolds, who included their commentary in letters or in small sheets ready for pasting. The letters were cut apart and tipped in, with the verso notes transcribed onto the margins of the appropriate pages. Most of the transcription is Reed's, and since he also has transcribed many of the notes by Steevens, the larger share of the work by far was his. Yet Steevens almost certainly began the project on his own, for his hand too is found in the marginal notes. I believe we might glimpse the important transfer of the edition to Reed, in a note signed by him, with the name crossed out, and the characteristic EDITOR substituted, in Steevens' hand (IV, 222). How the 1785 edition evolved has direct bearing on our understanding of the quarrel between Malone and Steevens. Steevens wrote Malone at least twice in early 1783, assuring him that he had no intention of bringing forth another edition. 2 On the strength of this assurance, Malone announced plans for his own edition in The Gentleman's Magazine in August, 1783. A curious fact is that Malone shared his new commentary notes for the first five volumes of this set, but that he did not provide new commentary for the second five volumes. Malone's withdrawal indicates, I think, that he had smoked Steevens out in his plan to bring forth another edition with Reed as the editor, and that he properly resented the misrepresentation under which he originally had shared his commentary. The quarrel between the two editors is thought to have resulted from problems arising after the publication of the 1785 Variorum, when Steevens demanded that Malone reprint his notes unaltered, with Steevens' replies, which Malone refused to do. 3 It would now appear, however, that the falling out began during the preparation of the 1785 edition. G. Blakemore Evans' judgment that the text of I Henry VI was carelessly printed in the 1785 Variorum 4 certainly is confirmed when the printer's copy for Macbeth is compared to the resulting text. There is warrant provided the printer for none of the 80 changes in punctuation and spelling. The presumed substantive emendation, "When [for Whence ] the sun 'gins his reflection" (1.2.25; TLN 44), is nowhere indicated in the prepared text and is probably an invention by the printer. The concept of the Variorum edition of Shakespeare as a constantly evolving reflection of the active commentators was developed during the eighteenth century, when an edition could be revised quickly, in an informal epistolary fashion. Thus in the similarly prepared copy of the 1793 Variorum, which was to become the 1803 edition, Steevens could look with pride to this, his fifth complete Variorum edition of Shakespeare in a single lifetime. 5 There is something splendid in that achievement, and we can admire it even though we realize that the modern Variorum Shakespeare is altogether different.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Manuscript Materials in the First Edition of Donne's Biathanatos by Ernest W. Sullivan, II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Subsequent to the description of three presentation copies of Biathanatos printed on large, fine paper having a "bunch of grapes" watermark, 1 and the manuscript corrections in John Sparrow's copies of both issues of the first edition of Biathanatos 2 as well as in the St John's College (Oxford) 3 and Yale University Library (CtY) 4 first-issue copies, the discovery of several other copies printed on fine paper and/or containing manuscript corrections, inscriptions, and presentation letters makes possible proof that: (1) the undated first issue was published in late September or early October of 1647, (2) some copies were specially printed for presentation, although others were also presented to potential patrons, and (3) the younger Donne, who edited Biathanatos , certainly authored some of the corrections and very probably made them all. A previously unknown letter in the copy presented to "y e R t Hon ble y e Lord Marquesse of Neucastle [Newcastle]" proves that Biathanatos circulated in manuscript, identifies and traces the genesis of the manuscript which became the printer's copy, and suggests that the younger Donne participated in that genesis. The following first-edition copies of Biathanatos have at least one of three characteristics: an inscription or presentation letter from Donne's son, John; fine paper; at least one of the seven recurring manuscript corrections, the first six in the "Epistle Dedicatory" and the last in the "Conclusion."

(15) Ernest Sullivan copy (purchased from Francis Edwards Ltd., 7 July 1976). Second issue, corrections (a)-(f). Dated letters and inscriptions plus other manuscript materials in five presentation copies and the dated Thomason second-issue copy place publication of the undated, first issue of Biathanatos in late September or early October of 1647. Three copies have fully dated presentation letters: copy (4), dated "Nouember i6 i647," with the "7 ber " addition in the younger Donne's hand in the Epistle Dedicatory; (6), "May y io i648"; and (5), "Julio 29 i649." Three others are partially dated: (1), "October i9"; (2), "October 26"; and (7), dated "1647" in the Bibliotheca Heberiana . Since Moseley had published the second issue by "Dec: 2 d 1647," 9 the October dates of first-issue copies (1) and (2) must precede 2 December 1647, and, since no second-issue presentation copies exist, the "1647" copy (7) must also antedate 2 December. Biathanatos was licensed on "20. Sept. 1644" (first edition, sig. Ee2 v ); hence the October dates could belong to 1644-47, but publication before "25 th Sept. 1646" when "Master War. Seale [Henry Seile]" entered Biathanatos in the Stationers' Register (I, 247) is extremely unlikely. 10 Copy (4), with its presentation letter to the Earl of Denbigh dated "Nouember i6 i647," provides the key evidence for a 1647 publication date, evidence strengthened by indications that the younger Donne held this copy in special regard: printed on fine paper, it has the "7 ber " addition (which very likely dates the Epistle Dedicatory) in his hand and is one of only two fully-corrected copies. Frequent pleas in the presentation letters that the recipient look upon the book with "favor" show that the younger Donne hoped to profit from publishing Biathanatos , and any delay would lessen the impression made by personal presentation copies; thus, had Biathanatos been published by 28 September 1646, he almost certainly would not have waited until 16 November 1647 to present the copy to Denbigh. Furthermore, sheet ¶, containing the Epistle Dedicatory, was printed last, 11 so that the younger Donne could have finished the Epistle Dedicatory on 28 September 1647 and easily have had it printed and bound before 16 November 1647. A similar argument results in a 1647 date for copies (1) and (2). Copy (1), inscribed "October i9," and (2), with its "October 26" letter, could belong to 1646 since Biathanatos was entered in the Stationers' Register on 25 September 1646, but again it seems extremely unlikely that the younger Donne would wait for nearly a year after presenting these two ordinary-paper copies in October of 1646 to send the special copy to Denbigh on 16 November 1647. A "28.7 ber " 1647 publication date would still allow time to prepare a copy for an "October i9" 1647 presentation; thus, the October dates also very probably belong to 1647, placing the publication of the first edition between 28 September and 19 October of 1647. Why the younger Donne waited until "Julio 29 i649" to present copy (5) to Constantine Huygens remains a mystery, though Huygens, who translated some of Donne's poems into Dutch, would have been an unlikely patron, but there was no delay in presenting copy (6) to Newcastle on "May y io i648": Newcastle, a Royalist, returned to England from Paris in April of 1648. Although the younger Donne may have intended to present all the corrected ordinary-paper copies as well as the fine-paper copies, the facts that all five fine-paper copies (4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) were presented and that he kept the sheets of at least two fine-paper copies after selling the sheets of at least two ordinary-paper corrected copies to Humphrey Moseley support Keynes's hypothesis that "it is probable that the special printing [on fine paper] was made mainly for presentation" (p. 119). 12 Because the younger Donne presented the corrected, ordinary-paper copies (1), (2), and (3), we can conjecture that very few fine-paper copies were printed and that he may have intended to present all the corrected copies as well. In any case, he decided very early to present corrected copies on ordinary paper; (1) and (2) have earlier dates than (4). The younger Donne soon changed his mind, however, about presenting corrected copies on ordinary paper and sold the ordinary-paper sheets, corrected or not, to Humphrey Moseley: (14) and (15) have corrections and the Moseley title page, and no ordinary-paper presentation copies carry a date later than 2 December 1647, by which time Moseley had published the second issue. On the other hand, the younger Donne did retain some fine-paper sheets: copies (6) and (5) are dated "May y io i648" and "Julio 29 i649" respectively. Moseley, who published many of Donne's works, probably offered the younger Donne more for the sheets of Biathanatos than any expected patronage from corrected copies on ordinary paper, but the younger Donne still wanted to try his luck with the fine-paper copies, probably without informing Moseley of their existence. The pattern of corrections implies that they were made at different times. A single person or persons copying all the corrections at one time would almost certainly emend more consistently, particularly if using an Errata list. Of course, an emendator or emendators with an Errata list could produce an erratic correction pattern if the various corrections were initiated at different times from an updated Errata list; however, dated, corrected copies prove that the inconsistencies do not result from additions to an Errata list. The earliest dated, corrected copy, (1), lacks (f) but has (g); the next earliest, (2), has (f) but lacks (g). One might explain the addition of (f) to (2) by a later recognition of the need for the correction, but not the dropping of (g), a clearly authoritative correction. 13 Furthermore, copy (4), dated "Nouember i6 1647," has all the corrections; but (6), dated "May y io i648," lacks (g); and (5), dated "Julio 29 i649," has none. Lastly, no possible chronological ordering of the undated copies can account for copy (13) having corrections (a)-(d) and (g), while (12) has (b)-(g), as the result of an updated Errata sheet. The pattern of corrections, then, strongly implies that they were introduced over a period of time but not from an Errata sheet, and the inconsistencies very likely result from carelessness or forgetfulness. The corrections were made after the sheets were positioned for binding, and ordinary-paper copies were corrected before 2 December 1647. All the corrections which offset do so on the pages which they face after normal quarto folding, 14 so that they must have been added with the sheets folded. Furthermore, the corrections (e) and (f) on sig. ¶4 v which offset do so on sig. (*) 1, proving that they were made with the sheets positioned for binding. 15 Correction (a) on sig. ¶3 of (13) and (14) must have been made before 2 December 1647, because the Moseley cancel title page versos, unlike those of the first-issue corrected copies, lack the offset. Since all first-issue copies with correction (a) have the offset, but none of the second-issue copies do, we can reasonably date correction (a) prior to 2 December 1647 in ordinary-paper copies. 16 No evidence suggests that corrections were introduced at different times in the same copy; thus, all the corrections in ordinary-paper copies were very likely completed before 2 December 1647. Although the sheets were corrected after positioning for binding, copy (6) offers dramatic evidence that the corrections could have been made before binding the sheets. In its presentation letter, reproduced below, the younger Donne suggests an intention to dedicate Biathanatos to Newcastle, and, to further this impression, the "List of Authors" (sigs. (*) 1-2 v ) in this copy has been put immediately before, rather than following, the printed Epistle Dedicatory to Philip Herbert; thus, the "List of Authors" comes between the presentation letter to Newcastle (sig. ¶1 v ) and the Epistle Dedicatory (beginning on sig. ¶3). Even with half sheet (*) between sigs. ¶2 v and ¶3, however, the correction on sig. ¶3 offsets on sig. ¶2 v , so the correction occurred before half-sheet (*) was positioned as presently bound, 17 perhaps long before presentation on "May y io i648." Since unbinding a fine-paper copy, inserting half-sheet (*) between sigs. ¶2 v and ¶3, and rebinding the volume would have been some trouble and inevitably done some damage to the pages, the order of pages in (6) suggests that the younger Donne kept the sheets for presentation copies unbound until an opportunity or inspiration for presentation arose. The evidence that the corrections are authoritative and initiated by the younger Donne is now overwhelming. On the basis of their occurrence in three copies, their clustering in the Epistle Dedicatory, the nonessential nature of corrections (a), (b), (e), and (f), and the textual authority of correction (g), I argued in "Authoritative" that all the corrections were authoritative and initiated by the younger Donne. The presence of the Epistle Dedicatory corrections in eleven copies clearly establishes their authority, and the younger Donne personally wrote the "exalted" correction in copies (1), (3), (4), and (10). 18 Furthermore, the incidence of Epistle Dedicatory corrections in presentation copies very strongly suggests that the younger Donne initiated them: such corrections occur in five of the eight extant presentation copies but in only six of eighty-six nonpresentation copies. Absence of Epistle Dedicatory corrections in three fine-paper, presentation copies does not destroy this connection: (5) and (9) also lack correction (g), which he usually made, and (g) in (8) is not in his hand. Since one of these uncorrected, fine-paper copies, (5), was presented on 29 July 1649, long after all ordinary-paper copies (2 December 1647) and one fine-paper copy (10 May 1648) were corrected, perhaps the other two, (8) and (9), were also presented late; if so, the corrections may have been omitted through forgetfulness. Finally, the unnecessary correction of "writ" to "writen" 19 may have been inspired by a letter from Donne to " S r Robert Carre now Earle of Ankerum, with my Book Biathanatos at my going into Germany," a letter later printed by the younger Donne in his father's Letters (pp. 21-22). In the Epistle Dedicatory, the sentence begins "It was writ, long since, by my Father, and by him, forbid both the Presse, and the Fire," clearly echoing Donne's letter: "It was written by me many years since . . . Reserve it for me, if I live, and if I die I only forbid it the Presse, and the Fire." The younger Donne, then, had easy and certain access to the letter, and the phrasing was so similar before the correction that he alone would have had any interest in rewriting the Epistle Dedicatory to parallel more exactly the letter. The younger Donne, then, wrote in at least four of the "exalted" corrections and almost certainly initiated all the corrections, and the available evidence now strongly implies that he also corrected the dedicatory epistle. Each Epistle Dedicatory correction involves the same hand and technique: correction (a) has an "i" superimposed on the "e" with an "s" added; (b) has an "e" on one side and an "n" on the other of the comma following "writ"; in (c), (d), (e), and (f), the parallel lines, parenthesis, and commas all have thick lines and exaggerated size. Undoubtedly, one person made each correction, and since no easily imaginable circumstances would lead to several people simultaneously correcting a single sheet, one person must have corrected all the dedicatory epistles. Unfortunately, the handwriting and correction technique do not conclusively identify the Epistle Dedicatory emendator, 20 but other evidence strongly suggests that the younger Donne authored the corrections. Many copies having manuscript materials in his hand also have Epistle Dedicatory corrections: he made correction (g) in copies (1), (3), (4), and (10), all of which have most of the Epistle Dedicatory corrections, as do five of the eight presentation copies. His manuscript addition, "7 ber ," in (6) proves that he wrote on a corrected page, sig. ¶4 v , in at least one Epistle Dedicatory. The handwriting and erratic correction pattern proved that one person made corrections (a)-(f) over a period of time without an Errata sheet; the younger Donne had access to corrected sheets from 28 September 1647 to 10 May 1648 as well as the independent authority to make even the unnecessary corrections (a), (b), (e), and (f). Finally, as author of the Epistle Dedicatory, he certainly had a personal interest in its accuracy, particularly in presentation copies. The previously unnoted letter in the first-issue, fine-paper copy presented to "y e Lord Marquesse of Neucastle," reproduced here by permission of the Houghton Library, confirms Donne's statement in a letter to Sir Robert Ker that Biathanatos had circulated in manuscript and makes it possible to trace the development of the holograph into the manuscript which served as the printer's copy for the first edition. In the letter to " S r Robert Carre now Earle of Ankerum, with my Book Biathanatos at my going into Germany" written between 9 March and 12 May of 1619, Donne describes the circulation of the holograph: "no hand hath passed upon it to copy it, nor many eyes to read it: onely to some particular friends in both Universities, then when I writ it, I did communicate it . . ." ( Letters , p. 21). As the unpublished letter shows, one of these friends was William Cavendish, First Duke of Newcastle (1592-1676), educated at St John's College, Cambridge ( DNB III, 1273), and "Marquis of Newcastle" on 27 October 1643: For y e R t Hon ble y e Lord Marquesse | of Neucastle | His Excellence. My Lorde knowinge, you were pleased to looke vpon | this Booke, when it was in an imperfect | Manuscript, (manie yeares since) in the | hands of S r Ieruaise Clifton; and, hauing | now printed it, only to defende it from | the mistakes of carelesse transcribers; | I beeleue, I cannot doe eyther my Father, or | my selfe, more right, then to present it | to your Lordships hands, soe entirely | from the Authors owne Penn, that it can | receaue noe addition, but of the honor of | beeinge receaued by your Lo rp : to whome | I should gladly dedicate, all that hee | eyther leaft or wisht mee; to make mee | capable of beeinge Your Lordships most humble Seruant Io: Donne. May y io i648 Cavendish received the M.A. from St John's College (Cambridge) on 8 July of 1608, about the time Donne finished Biathanatos . Biographical notes compiled by the late F. P. White, Keeper of the Records at St John's College, and provided by A. G. Lee, the College Librarian, prove that "S r Ieruaise Clifton" was Gervase Clifton, Esquire (1587-1666), posthumous son of George Clifton (died 1 August 1587) by Winifred, daughter of Sir Anthony Thorold and grandson of Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton Hall in Nottinghamshire. Clifton attended St John's from 1603 until he received the M.A. in 1612. He was a friend and neighbor of Newcastle and an acquaintance of Henry Wotton, 21 which might account for his connection with Donne. The younger Donne's comments on the various states of Biathanatos are maddeningly vague, but do fill in important links in the evolution of the holograph into the manuscript used by the younger Donne as the printer's copy for the first edition, 22 an evolution in which he may have participated. Donne's son does not specify whether the "imperfect Manuscript" possessed by Clifton was a holograph or what was "imperfect" about it, though his comment about not needing any "addition" in its present state could imply that he considered the earlier manuscript incomplete. Given Donne's statement in the letter to Ker that the manuscript had not been copied but shown to friends at the universities plus the presence of Clifton and Newcastle at St John's College about the time Donne finished Biathanatos , we can reasonably infer that the "imperfect Manuscript" was probably the original holograph, which Donne would add to extensively before it became the printer's copy. The younger Donne's assessment of the holograph seen by Newcastle as "imperfect" (in the sense of "incomplete") relative to the printer's copy would seem correct on the basis of differences between the Bodleian manuscript and the first edition. Besides several lines omitted from the Bodleian manuscript as the result of eyeskip errors, the first edition contains the following additions: (1) hundreds of Section and Distinction headings in the text and numbered marginal glosses 23 of uncertain origin; (2) authoritative marginal annotations, " Herennius ." (p. 51), " Festus ." (p. 53), " Supra. fo. 66." (p. 66), " Vbi supra ." (p. 101), " Stanf. Plees de Coron. cap. Petie treason ." (p. 117), " Declaration &amp; Protestation des Doctes de France ." (p. 120), " Liber Conformi. Fran. &amp; Christi ." (p. 123), " Sedulius Minor. Advers. Alcor. Francis ." (p. 123), " Gerson ." (p. 125), " Navar ex Dist. 5. de cons. " (p. 129), " Binsfeld. de confes. sagarum f. 67." (p. 144), " Menghi fustis Daemonum, cap. 8." (p. 144), " Ema. Sâ Not : in univers : Script. " (p. 158), " Supra. " (p. 160), " Phil. 1. 23" (p. 183), " Joh. 15. 13." (p. 187), " Act. 15. 26." (p. 188), " Hist. Schol. " (p. 202), " Supra fo. 130" (p. 211), and " Supra " (p. 212); and (3) an authoritative passage postdating the Bodleian manuscript, "And since both Saint Hierome , and the Bracarense Councell, inflict the same punishments upon those Catechumeni , who although they had all other preparations, and degrees of maturity in the Christian Faith, yet departed out of this world without Baptisme, as they doe upon Selfe murtherers , and so made them equall in punishment, and consequently in guiltinesse; I thinke it will ill become the Doctrines of our times, and the Analogy thereof, to pronounce so desperately of either of their damnations. Sert. Senen. lib. 6 Annot . 7. p. 311." (p. 89, ll. 12-23). Since " Sert. . . . 311.", normally a marginal annotation, 24 appears in the text after "damnations." as though it were the next sentence, we can infer that the sentence, "And . . . damnations.", was probably written in the margin of the printer's copy. Had "And . . . damnations." been written in the margin just above the marginal annotation, " Sert. . . . 311.", the compositor might easily have read the marginal annotation as part of the text. If, as seems likely, Newcastle saw the original holograph, and if the above additions formed the basis for the younger Donne's judgment that the manuscript seen by Newcastle was "imperfect," then the printer's copy, "entirely from the Authors owne Penn," was probably the original seen by Newcastle, subsequently sent to Ker in 1619, 25 and afterwards added to by Donne. Since the Bodleian manuscript was transcribed before the holograph which served as the printer's copy conjecturally arrived at its final state, the holograph could have served as copy for the Bodleian manuscript as well as for the printer. Indeed, shared errors and incorrect marginal references in the quarto indicate that the Bodleian manuscript and the first edition probably derive from a single manuscript in different stages of completion. 26 The statement about "the mistakes of carelesse transcribers" and claim that the quarto reproduces a manuscript "entirely from the Authors owne Penn" probably allude to the Bodleian manuscript. The younger Donne knew this manuscript: his presentation letters to Denbigh and Huygens extensively paraphrase his father's presentation letter sent with it to Lord Herbert of Cherbury. 27 The younger Donne's reference to "the mistakes of carelesse transcribers" could be his description of the Bodleian manuscript, but it may instead reflect his fears that someone else might seize the holograph or use the Bodleian manuscript (or a transcription of it) for an edition of Biathanatos . 28 The Bodleian manuscript is not "entirely" in Donne's hand: the presentation letter " To the Noblest knight S r Edward Herbert ," hundreds of marginal annotations, and a sixteen-word correction added to the text (p. 215) are, but not the text. The Bodleian manuscript transcriber was not, however, "carelesse"; he made some eyeskip and other errors, but numerous corrections testify to his fairly careful proofreading, and bibliographical evidence of all kinds proves that he more accurately reproduced his copy than did the compositors of the first edition. 29 Thus, the younger Donne's concern about "carelesse transcribers" has no basis in fact if aimed at the Bodleian manuscript, and probably reflects an effort to promote his edition. Furthermore, his claim that the printer's copy is "entirely from the Authors owne Penn" may be false. The hundreds of Section and Distinction headings and numbered marginal glosses in the first edition but omitted in the Bodleian manuscript add no new information and contribute nothing to the understanding of the text; therefore, their source is uncertain. Surely had Donne considered such headings or glosses useful or necessary he would have included them when he added the hundreds of marginal annotations in the manuscript of Biathanatos sent to Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Since the first-edition running-title lists the Part, Distinction, and Section number from the table of contents for the text on every page, the headings in the text as well as the numbered glosses, which generally merely paraphrase the table of contents, are superfluous. It seems very unlikely that Donne, who, as the letter to Ker clearly shows, never intended to publish Biathanatos and who carefully limited its readership to congenial and learned persons, would add unnecessary headings and glosses to widen the possible audience of the work to the lazy and simple-minded, a purpose more suited to the financial needs of the younger Donne. And, indeed, the younger Donne could have been responsible for adding the headings and marginal glosses: the Newcastle presentation letter shows that he was familiar with differences between various stages and states of the texts of Biathanatos , and he made manuscript corrections in the Epistle Dedicatory and Conclusion. Thanks to the letter to Newcastle, we have a more complete picture of the probable manuscript transmission of Biathanatos : (1) completion in 1608; (2) holograph circulated in manuscript to "S r Ieruaise Clifton" and "y e Lord Marquesse of Neucastle" shortly afterward; (3) holograph presented for safekeeping to "Robert Carre" in 1619; (4) holograph returned to Donne and transcription made for Lord Herbert of Cherbury; 30 (5) addition of lengthy passage and some marginal annotations to the holograph by Donne as well as textual headings and numbered marginal glosses by an unidentified person, perhaps Donne's son; (6) use of the corrected holograph as the printer's copy of the first edition; and (7) destruction of the holograph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Robert S. Pirie, "Fine Paper Copies of Donne's Biathanatos," The Book Collector , 14 (1965), 362. Fine-paper copies have pages as large as 6 x 7 3/4 inches; ordinary copies have pages up to 5 11/16 x 7 9/16 inches on paper with an elaborate vase watermark closely resembling the twin watermarks a and b of "Pot C/AB" in figures 7a and 7b in Allan H. Stevenson's "Watermarks Are Twins," SB , 4 (1951-52), 72. The only differences are that the crescent in the vase's neck in Biathanatos is in its body in Stevenson's illustration, and the initials, "BV," in the vase's body in Biathanatos are "AB" in Stevenson's example. Interestingly, Stevenson's watermark is from a work published in 1655 by J. Flesher, printer of Donne's Letters to Severall Persons of Honour (London, 1651). 2 John Sparrow, "Manuscript Corrections in the Two Issues of Donne's Biathanatos," The Book Collector , 21 (1972), 29-32. Reprinted in To Geoffrey Keynes (1972), pp. 65-68, 3 plates. The two issues differ only in their title pages: the undated, first-issue title page lists John Dawson as the printer whereas that of the second issue asserts that the work was printed for Humphrey Moseley in 1648. 3 Charles Morgenstern, "John Sparrow's 'Manuscript Corrections in Two Issues of Donne's Biathanatos,'" The Book Collector , 21 (1972), 557. 4 Ernest Sullivan, "Authoritative Manuscript Corrections in Donne's Biathanatos," SB , 28 (1975), 268-276. 5 Presentation copy number one in Geoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of Dr. John Donne , 4th ed. (1973), p. 113. He identifies "the Kinsmoll" as "Lady Kingsmell," but inaccurately and incompletely transcribes the inscription and does not locate the copy. 6 I have not seen this volume; James S. Irvine, Speer Library Assistant Librarian for Public Services, provided the information. 7 Transcribed in Ernest Sullivan's "The Presentation Letter in the Earl of Oxford Copy of Donne's Biathanatos," PBSA , 70 (1976), 405. 8 Mr. Pirie graciously provided this information. Keynes lists (p. 116) a ninth presentation copy inscribed "A Present from Doctor John Dunne," but does not identify its inscriber or location, and the signature, "Doctor John Dunne," is unlike the usual "Io: Donne." Pirie's note mentions another possible first-issue, fine-paper copy, but its location is unknown: "Lot 1179 in the Ellis Sale (Sotheby, 16 November 1885), Donne, Biathanatos [? 1646] ( Wing D 1858) is described as being on 'large' paper" (p. 362). 9 Although the Stationers' Register shows that Moseley formally acquired the rights to Biathanatos on "13th Junii 1649" (I, 320), the title page of George Thomason's copy of the second issue (British Museum, E.418.[11]) bears the manuscript date "Dec: 2 d 1647." Thomason's acquisition of this second-issue copy is also dated "2 Dec." in the Catalogue of the Pamphlets, Books, Newspapers, and Manuscripts Relating to the Civil War, the Commonwealth, and Restoration, collected by George Thomason, 1640-1661 (1908), I, 576. 10 For the arguments against publication prior to 25 September 1646, see Ernest Sullivan's "The Genesis and Transmission of Donne's Biathanatos," The Library , 5th Series, 31 (1976), 63-64. 11 Ernest Sullivan, "Marginal Rules as Evidence," SB , 30 (1977), 176-177. 12 Keynes's identification of "larger paper" copies is inconsistent: "three of the presentation copies (nos. 2, 4, and 10 above) are on the larger paper, 7 5/8 x 6 in." (p. 119). J. C. T. Oates, ULC Reader in Historical Bibliography, informs me that copy (2) has 7 1/2 x 5 9/16-inch pages in the original binding (somewhat smaller than the 7 9/16 x 5 11/16-inch pages of copy [1] on ordinary paper), and its vase watermark shows clearly in my microfilm; thus, any inference from Keynes that his copy number two was specially printed on the larger paper having the bunch of grapes and/or coat of arms watermark for presentation would be incorrect. Keynes does correctly list (6), the other MH fine-paper presentation copy described in Pirie's note, as a large-paper copy in footnote 2 on page 119. 13 Copies (1), (3), (4), and (10) have correction (g) in the hand of the younger Donne. For the textual basis of its authority, see Sullivan's "Authoritative," pp. 272-273. 14 Other than those facing the verso of the cancel title page, only the following corrections fail to offset: copy (1), correction (g); (3), (e); (4), (e), (f); (8), (g); (10), (d). 15 Collation of a normal copy of Biathanatos runs ¶ 4 (*) 2 π A 4 A-Z 4 , Aa 2 -Dd 4 Ee 2 , but half-sheets (*) and Ee were printed on a single sheet with one quarto skeleton-forme: the outer forme contained Ee(o) and (*)(i), and the inner, Ee(i) and (*)(o). After imposition, the sheet would have been cut in half, each half folded once, and then folded half-sheet (*) placed after sig. ¶4 v for binding and folded half-sheet Ee, after sig. Dd4 v . 16 Failure of (a) to offset on the cancel title page does not establish a terminal date for corrections in fine-paper copies: they are all first issue, and at least (5) and (6) were presented after 2 December 1647. 17 Jessica Owaroff, Houghton Library Reading Room Librarian, informs me that (6) has been rebound in nineteenth-century calf, so that the evidence derived from the order of its sheets is not conclusive; however, the possibility that a nineteenth-century binder erroneously placed half-sheet (*) between sigs. ¶2 v and ¶3 is remote indeed. 18 I have not seen correction (g) in (13), but Sparrow describes the handwriting as "clearly different from that in which the corrections in the Dedication are made" (p. 30), leaving its authorship uncertain. The existence of only correction (g) in an unknown hand in (8), a presentation copy, is an anomaly. This correction (g) does not look like those made by the younger Donne: "exacted" is not crossed out, and "exalted" is written above it rather than in the margin. The need for (g) and the choice of "exalted" would not be obvious to anyone unfamiliar with the text. Perhaps someone saw this correction on other sheets or in another copy, and, recognizing the superiority of the "exalted" reading, made the correction. The correction could also derive from the manuscript sent by Donne to Lord Herbert of Cherbury and given to the Bodleian Library in 1642, but anyone comparing this manuscript with the first edition would surely have also made a great many other much more obvious corrections. 19 According to the OED , "writ" occurs as the past participle of "write" from the sixteenth century onward. For an explanation of the younger Donne's use of "writen" instead of "written," see Morgenstern's note. 20 The only letters made without size restriction and on a blank surface, the "s" in (a) and "n" in (b), appear to be in the hand of the younger Donne; however, the "e" in (b) has a much larger loop than does his usual "e" or either "e" in his "exalted" corrections. Also, the Epistle Dedicatory corrections have the new letters superimposed over the old; whereas examples of (g) in his hand have a series of short, diagonal lines through "exacted", with "exalted" written in the margin beside the obliterated "exacted". 21 See the Reliquiae Wottoninae , 3rd ed. (1672), p. 441 and L. P. Smith's Life and Letters of Sir Henry Wotton (1907), II, 465. 22 For all previous identifications of the printer's copy, see Sullivan's "Genesis," pp. 57-58. 23 The marginal annotations, on the other hand, are keyed by letter to a location in the text and identify Donne's sources. 24 " Sert. Senen. lib. 6. Annot. 7. p. 311." is a citation of Sisto da Siena's Bibliotheca Sancta a F. Sixto Senensi (Frankfort: Nicolai Bassaei, 1575). The information actually is in "Liber sextus. Annotatio CCCXI" (sig. 3E1). 25 Roger E. Bennett, in "Donne's Letters to Severall Persons of Honour," PMLA , 56 (1941), first conjectured that the manuscript sent to Ker was the printer's copy (pp. 129-131). 26 Sullivan, "Genesis," pp. 58-60. 27 The letter " To the Noblest knight S r Edward Herbert " is photographically reproduced and accurately transcribed in Evelyn Simpson's A Study of the Prose Works of John Donne , 2nd ed. (1948), pages ii and 161 respectively. 28 He most clearly expresses these fears in the Epistle Dedicatory: "For, since the beginning of the War, my Study having been often searched, all my Books (and al-most my braines, by their continuall allarums) sequestred, for the use of the Committee; two dangers appeared more eminently to hover over this, being then a Manuscript; a danger of being utterly lost, and a danger of being utterly found; and fathered, by some of those wild Atheists . . ." (sigs. ¶3 v -¶4). 29 For a full analysis of the textual superiority of the Bodleian manuscript, see pages 147-163 of Sullivan's unpublished dissertation, "A Critical, Old-spelling Edition of John Donne's Biathanatos " (UCLA, 1973), University Microfilms order number 73-16, 704. 30 Donne might have been adding some marginal annotations to the holograph at this point; had its marginal annotations been complete, they, too, would have been transcribed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Texts of Marvell's Satires: II by A. S. G. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seems clear that we are still at some remove from a definitive text of Marvell's poems. Most important, there are still further manuscript texts to be evaluated which, since they were apparently unknown to Marvell's editors, may have some bearing on the construction of any finally authoritative text. Recently R. M. Schuler and I drew attention to one such manuscript, Princeton MS. AM 14401, containing texts of Marvell's satires. 1 In the following note I would like to draw attention to a number of further apparently hitherto unexamined texts of Marvell's satires existing in manuscripts in the Portland collection now in Nottingham University Library. 2 There are in the Portland collection five manuscripts containing such apparently unnoticed versions of Marvell's satires. MS. PwV 40 has the largest number of such texts, containing copies of "The Statue-in-Stocks-Market," "Nostradamus, a Prophecy," "Upon the Statue at Charing Cross," and Britannia and Rawleigh." MS. PwV 299 contains "Last Instructions to a Painter." And MSS. PwV 301-303 are all copies of "Further Advice to a Painter." In the notes that follow I will offer a brief discussion of each of these manuscripts, a full list of each of their variant readings from the standard edition of Marvell's poems, and a discussion of the significance of these variants insofar as that can be determined in the light of published variants. 3 PwV 40 is a large manuscript miscellany containing versions of a number of poems by (among others) Rochester, Etheredge, Sackville, Saville and Dryden. It can be linked on the evidence of content and possibly also of hand with another miscellany volume, the so-called Gyldenstolpe manuscript. This latter manuscript was "evidently compiled in England in late summer of 1680." 4 It seems likely that PwV 40 also belongs approximately to the same period. Certainly none of the poems in it which I have been able to date are later than 1680. And the Marvell poems it contains all can be reliably shown to have been composed during the period April 1673-July 1675. 5 It seems likely then that all the texts in this manuscript are relatively early. Variant readings and notes on each of the Marvell poems in Portland now follow. i) "On the Statue Erected by Sir Robert Viner" (here titled "Stocks Market Statute" (pp. 158-60). Text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 188-190; variant readings in Lord, p. 468. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 1. cities] Cittisens 1. the]theire 1. fierce] first 2. their] adds own 2. citadels] Cittedell 3. statue] Statute 3. in] a 4. bankers] a Banker 5. knightly] mighty 5. generous] gracious 6. and] on 7.

It shares eight readings (1, 6, 9, 12, 14, 25, 31, 57) common to all these texts. In addition it shares another three readings with f and o alone (45, 51(2)). And there are four agreements solely with o (5(2), 54(2)) and one (60) solely with Portland. The evidence in sum tends to point to a common ancestor for all this group of texts. The Portland text is of obvious potential in determining the readings of the archetype of this group. ii) "Nostradamus' Prophecy" (titled "Nostradamus a Prophecy"), pp. 171-2. Text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 178-179; variants in Lord, p. 459. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 1.] Her faults and follys Londons doom shall fix 2.] And she must sink in flames in sixty six 3. and] om. 6.] Beyond all hope, aspiring towards the skys 7. trick] thing. 8.] Though its walls stands [ sic ], shall bring the Citty lower 10. share] shars 10. the] to 11. the Soveraign] by th'easy 15. use] com 15. parts] part 17. is the Premier] shall be prime 18. sin] Crime 19.

There is virtually no significant agreement with other manuscripts. Portland shares two readings (7, 11) with Osborn Chest II, no. 13 (Yale) and two with the printed editions of Poems on Affairs of State (1689) (Lord's f ) and (1697) (Lord's m ). But the general implication of the variant readings in Portland seems to suggest an independently derived early text, one that is therefore potentially of value in establishing Marvell's text. iii) "The Statue at Charing Cross" (titled "Vpon the Statue at Charing Cross Charles the first"), pp. 173-174. Text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 199-201; variants in Lord, p. 469. The full list of the variant readings is as follows: 2. continues still] has been still 2. board] boards 3. Dear] adds Sir Charles 3. all] om. 4. be 1 ] is 6. Theatre] feather 8. of] om. 10.] Sinc [ sic ] a Guard and a Garden could not one defend 11. they will] they'l 13. these] their 17.

In a few cases (e.g. 10, 36) Portland can be shown to agree with the group Taylor 1, Folger Library m.b. 12, Bod. Don. b. 8 and B.L. Harley 7315. But the evidence is inconclusive. Portland seems to be an independently derived text. iv) "Britannia and Rawleigh," pp. 179-85. Text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 194-99; variants in Lord, pp. 464-5. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 1. thy . . . resign] thou didst thy breath resign 3. 'um] them 5. Scottish] Scotich 10.

Harley 7317 as evidenced by seventeen common readings (10, 17, 24, 39, 43, 57, 62, 68, 77(2), 84, 94, 113, 147, 172, 189, 194). But on only one of these occasions (94) is the agreement exclusive to Portland and Harley 7317, although on eight other occasions (43, 57, 84, 113, 171, 173, 189, 194) Harley 7317 is the only other manuscript that agrees—the other texts involved are the printed editions of Poems of Affairs of State for 1689 and 1697 (Lord's e and m ). The text of "Britannia and Rawleigh" is the most puzzling of those in Portland. And a number of its readings appear demonstrably incorrect (e.g. 24, 33, 44, 46, 47, 54, 65). Other categories of variant reading (e.g. those involving changes in word order, substitution of equivalent words and phrases and minor additions) suggest an intrusive scribal intelligence unwilling to follow copy faithfully. It is conceivable that Portland could reflect a revised text of Marvell's poem deriving directly from the author. But I remain generally dubious about the potential authority of its readings. PwV 40 is an interesting manuscript in relation to the text of Marvell's satires. Its variant readings do not generally fall into patterns suggesting clear textual links with other extant manuscripts. For this reason, and given that the manuscript is an early one, it would seem likely that any definitive edition of Marvell's poems will need to take account of PwV 40. The other four Portland manuscripts—PwV 299, 301-303—all contain only single works, their Marvell poems. The first of these, PwV 299, a booklet of twenty-two leaves comprising "The Last Instructions to a Painter," is dated on the title page "London / September the 4 th 1667." The text is in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 147-172; variants are in Lord, pp. 452-453. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 40. ask] asks 42. were] wear 60. D---s ] Dukes 137. where e're] where s'ere 160. Though] Thought 554. The 1 ] Their 764. here] her 817. de ] om. 896. rise] rises The existence of this text of "Last Instructions . . ." is of particular interest since manuscript copies of it are relatively rare. Indeed, Margoliouth in his first edition of the Poems did not know of any and based his text essentially on a printed edition of 1689. 6 Lord knew of two manuscripts, one in the Osborne collection at Yale and Bodleian Eng. poet. d. 49, his copy text. There is some agreement between the Bodleian and Portland manuscripts—see e.g. 40, 42, 137, 817. But a collation of the two manuscripts reveals a number of significant divergences. In the great majority of the cases of divergence, Portland agrees with the 1689 edition used as copy text by Margoliouth/ Legouis. 7 There seem grounds for an hypothesis that Portland may have been based on a printed edition. Such an assumption is strengthened by aspects of the physical appearance of the Portland manuscript. Many of the proper names as well as other phrases are scribally differentiated in small capitals (instead of the usual cursive), presumably to reflect a typographic distinction between roman and italic. But the printed edition may not have been the sole source for the Portland copy. There are a few readings which are unique to Portland. 8 And Portland prints in full names which are indicated by dashes in the 1689 edition. 9 It would seem either that the Portland scribe supplemented his copy by reference to another source, a manuscript textually close to the Bodleian one, or that he was working from a corrected copy of the 1689 printed edition, corrected by reference to a source close to the Bodleian manuscript. The final three manuscripts, PwV 301-303, also contain only single texts of the same poem "Further Advice to a Painter." PwV 301 is a folded sheet. The text is in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 176-177; variants are in Lord, pp. 456-457. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 6. Brittain] Brittains 7. the 2 ] om. 12. our] a 13. Where] Were 14. does] doth 19. in] w th 20. of] in 21. devide] decide 27. his] this 33. with] &amp; 35. Thus] That. 40. his] a 42.] om. 46. Beams] Banners 46. Sands's] Sandys his 47. Sate] seate 50. aime] aimes There seems no especially significant agreement with any other manuscript. Indeed, the only textual link seems to be with Douce 357, with which Portland shares two readings (33, 35). In addition, lines 25-6 occur only in two manuscripts, Douce and National Library of Scotland Advocates 19.1.12. In general, little importance seems to attach to its variant readings, which seem of minor significance. Portland PwV 302 is a single sheet. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 14. does] doth 19. in] w th 33. with] and 33. repleat] repeate 35. Thus] That 47. Sate] State Once again there is some agreement with Douce 357 (see e.g. 33(2), 35). Indeed the two texts differ at very few points. Since Douce was the copy text for both Margoliouth/Legouis and Lord this close textual connection seems to establish Portland as a text of some potential authority, since it does not seem to derive directly from Douce. PwV 303 is a single folded sheet. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 3. here] there 6. Brittain] Brittons 7. work] works 13-16.] om. 19. Our] With 20. the 2 ] our 21. great] grave 25-26.] om. 27. his] this 29. next] Scene 30.] The Reall figure of ye Councell Board 35. Thus] That 38. fate] fall 38. Plebeian] Plebean's 45. Tis] This 46. Sands's] Sandys his 49-52.] om. 55. walks] leads After 56 inserts 49-52. 49. Two] Four 57. Thus] They 59-64.] om. Here the readings tend to show a significant degree of agreement with the group Bodleian Don. b. 8 and Osborn Chest II, no. 3 (Yale). There are five readings common to all three texts (13-16, 21, 25-26, 49, 59-64). Several of these readings (e.g. 13-16, 25-26, 59-64) are also shared with B. L. Add. 23722. In two other significant substantive readings (29, 55) Portland and the B. L. manuscript also agree. One would venture to hypothesize that Portland is possibly an independently derived text from the common source(s) of these other three manuscripts. Lord noted in the course of preparing his Poems on Affairs of State edition "the difficulty of making a complete collection of manuscripts." 10 Doubtless further texts of Marvell's poems will come to light in future years to add, with the Portland manuscripts, further grist for the editor's mill. But it is only by continuing the search with the care and diligence that marked Professor Lord's own labours that we will move towards the prospect of a fully authoritative text of Marvell's satires.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Preacher and Publisher: Oliver Heywood and Thomas Parkhurst by Harold Love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The diaries and memoranda of the Yorkshire non-conformist Oliver Heywood (1630-1702) 1 preserve valuable information about the production and distribution of his eighteen books, and in doing so raise a number of interesting questions about the commercial basis of clerical publication in seventeenth-century England. It was Heywood's custom to list the numbers of copies received from his publishers, and the names of those to whom they were distributed, giving him perhaps the best-documented public of any provincial author before the advent of the subscription list. It is also clear that he was not as a general rule paid cash for his manuscript, but in bound copies of the work, and that over and above these copies he would normally purchase a significant portion of the edition for distribution among his co-denominationalists. As his publisher was in all but three cases an important London bookseller, Thomas Parkhurst, it seems likely that a general trade practice was involved. Heywood belonged by descent to a highly literate culture of Puritan clothworkers and farmers spread over Eastern Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire which even in the earlier years of the seventeenth century probably formed a significant market for London printers of devotional literature. His mother instructed him from an early age in "Mr Bals" catechism 2 and "was continually putting us upon reading the scriptures and good bookes" (I, 51). His father, a fustian manufacturer of Bolton, assembled a library of "the most plain practicall experimentall Treatises in Divinity such as Calvin, Luther in English Mr Perkins, Dr Preston, Dr Sibs" only to lose it to Prince Rupert's soldiers who discovered the books imperfectly concealed in a "colepit-house" and burned them on Cockey Moor (I, 84). Oliver himself was a patient accumulator of books, a catalogue of 1664 listing 264 items, though like his father he lost volumes through confiscation. 3 The printed memoranda also include a list of twenty-nine titles acquired during 1677-78, and a summary of a register of borrowers. 4 There is in addition a reference to his being called upon to "prize" the books of a deceased fellow clergyman (I, 294). Testimony to the general knowledge of religious literature of Heywood's Coley congregation is an anecdote of a candidate minister who attempted to present a printed sermon as his own but "was traced by the sent of an intelligent hearer even as he was preaching it" (I, 189). For the victims of the great ejectment of 24 August 1662, of whom Heywood was certainly not the least heroic, the printed word gained an added importance as a means of communication with their scattered and embattled flocks. Heywood seems to have regarded his writing as an extension of his personal ministry, declaring in the dedication of his first book, Heart Treasure (1667) to his " very loving and dearly beloved Friends and Neighbours, the Inhabitants of Coley, and the places adjacent ": Let God glorifie himself whatever become of this vile wretched worm; the good of your souls lyes near my heart, God is my witnesse how greatly I long after your spiritual welfare; it much grieves me to think of leaving any of your souls without a saving Treasure after all my soul-travel over you, and serving two full Apprentiships amongst you (A4 v ). The appearance of the book in print prompted the following note in his diary: My book of heart-treasure being printed, I had and paid for 10li s worth of them, and they are all dispersed and disposed of and I hear they doe some good, blessed be god (I, 246). The work had characteristically been composed in the course of an energetic tour of the houses of sympathisers and of scattered conventicles immediately following his banishment from his former parish under the Five Mile Act (I, 224). A separate memorandum (III, 66-69) allows us to follow the distribution of Heywood's share of the edition of Heart Treasure in exact detail. The £10 covers two separate deliveries of sixty copies, the first of which was received in Yorkshire and the second in Lancashire. The Yorkshire list records the recipients of fifty-six copies, most of them Heywood's hearers, some of whom took two or more. The Lancashire list is largely composed of relatives. These first deliveries appear to have been received in September or October 1667. At Christmas a further dozen arrived, followed by an undated two dozen and then a further twenty-eight received on 20 February 1667/8, after which four further consignments are recorded, the last dated 12 February 1670/1. The "dozens" usually consisted of fourteen copies, except for the last two deliveries when they had shrunk to thirteen. The total number of copies distributed by Heywood, the sum being calculated from his headnotes rather than the lists of recipients which are not always complete, appears to have been 286. The books were delivered bound, but it is not clear whether the unit cost of 1/8d includes the cost of carriage. Similar lists are preserved for the distribution of eleven of Heywood's other books. Closet Prayer a Christian Duty was received by Heywood in sixteen separate batches dated between 1669 (this edition does not appear to survive) and 28 February 1681/2, totalling at least 324 copies (III, 53, 69-73). In this case, as well as the bundles from Parkhurst there were three copies "Bought at Manchest" and a further group of five "Ordered to be bought at Bolton octob 19 [1669]." The first copies of the second edition were received on 26 August 1670. Sure Mercies of David, or, the Second Part of Heart Treasure (1672) was delivered to Heywood on 17 February 1671/2 as a consignment of eight dozen (=100) books. Fourteen of these are in a separate sublist headed "guilded b" recording bestowal on such worthies as Lady Hewley, Lady Watson, Lady Standley and Heywood's wife and first wife's mother. (It would seem that as a general rule he also reserved one of the gilt copies for himself.) Four further consignments followed, the last of which, bringing the total to 172 copies, was received on 17 August 1672 (III, 51-53). In the case of Life in God's Favour (1679), for which Heywood temporarily abandoned Parkhurst in favour of Dorman Newman, 5 twelve dozen copies were received or assigned according to his direction between 29 March and 16 June 1679, of which one dozen were gilt—four being more particularly designated "guilded edges"—and the remainder plain, one consignment being noted as "white leather" i.e. vellum (II, 211-213). The dozens in this case were an exact twelve. Of Israel's Lamentation after the Lord (1683), Heywood initially took delivery of twenty-five gilt copies and seventy-five plain arriving on 3 February 1682/3, after which he records the receipt of a further eight copies from the Halifax bookseller Francis Bentley, four dozen from Parkhurst at 9/- a dozen, and a final consignment of five from Parkhurst sent for on 1 April 1683, making 161 in all (II, 214-215). Heywood also took eight dozen copies of his A Narrative of the Holy Life and Happy Death of . . . Mr. John Angier (1683), the first two dozen arriving on 26 September 1684 (II, 215). For Baptismal Bonds Renewed (1687) there was again a special "12 better bound then ordinary in calves leath: guilt," one of which went to Mrs. Heywood and another to Lady Hewley (III, 53). The headnotes of the distribution lists are more than usually cryptic in this case but indicate that Heywood was responsible between 10 October 1687 and 31 March 1688 for the disposal of at least 188 copies (III, 53-55). Of his later books, Heywood took 300 copies of Meetness for Heaven (1690) at 9d per copy, 100 of Advice to an Only Child (1693), 200 of The Heavenly Converse (1697), printed for John Back, 150 of The General Assembly (1700), and eighty of The Two Worlds (1701). 6 He also records the receipt of twenty-five copies of Christ's Intercession (1701) (IV, 262). The books for which no records survive among the printed memoranda are The Best Entail and A Family-Altar (both 1693), the Life of the Rev. Nathaniel Heywood (1694), and Job's Appeal and A New Creature (both 1695). Heywood also assisted in the distribution of 400 copies of his brother Nathaniel's Christ Displayed (1679) (II, 213-214). His energetic subvention through purchase of the publication of his works is an interesting gloss on Dunton's riddling comment that Parkhurst had been known to "sell off a whole Impression before the Book has been almost heard of in London ." 7 Scattered among the lists of consignments and recipients are a number of references to Heywood's financial agreements with his publishers. In the case of Heart Treasure , all the copies received by Heywood were apparently paid for, suggesting that publication had been secured through an agreement to purchase a given proportion of the edition. The dedication refers to an undertaking by friends who had read the work in manuscript that "some would be at the charges" (A4 r ); however there is no reference to any such subvention in Heywood's own records. For a number of his subsequent books it is clear that a rather different arrangement prevailed under which while continuing to purchase substantial numbers of copies he would receive a quantity gratis in payment for his manuscript. Recording the distribution of Life in God's Favour , he refers specifically to "6 dozen wch Mr Dorman Newman gave me for my copy" (II, 212). A further six dozen were also purchased by Heywood at 11d a copy. For his brother's book Christ Displayed , which was published by Parkhurst, the terms were that the widow would receive 100 volumes for the copy and that the family would purchase another 300 (II, 213). In the case of Israel's Lamentation after the Lord , Heywood received 100 copies gratis, twenty-five of them gilt, and paid Parkhurst 36/- for a further four dozen (II, 214-5). With The General Assembly , fifty were given gratis and a further 100 taken at 9d each, 6/2d being specified for carriage. A notebook of reflections and engagements preserves details of a similar agreement with regard to Baptismal Bonds Renewed : At last I haue seen something of the fruit of my labours last year, for this year is come forth into the world my Book of Baptismal Bonds or my Treatise of Personal Covenanting which came to my hands, Octob. 10 1687 he let me haue 100 for 10 li w ch I paid to J T for Mr Parkhurst, 50 he gave me, besides 12 more, all these I distributed gratis to my hearers about home, my relations and friends abroad in Lanc—at York—&amp;c and doe understand that it is acceptable and likely to proue profitable, blessed be god:(III, 229). The distribution lists among the memoranda give the number of free copies received from Parkhurst as 71 not 62. They also reveal that subsequent purchases were at the lower rate of 1/8d a copy. Details also survive of the publication of Heavenly Converse printed for John Back by arrangement with Matthew Pinkerton of Manchester. On this occasion Heywood received only twelve copies gratis but purchased a further 200 "at 4½ in sheets 6½ bound" —a rate which will be seen to be very favorable 8 (II, 215-216). With The Two Worlds Heywood records the receipt of thirty free copies and fifty at 3d (IV, 259-261). The general pattern seems clear enough, though there were no doubt variations according to the price, bulk and estimated popularity of the volume. The precise degree of advantage to author and bookseller under this system would depend on whether the author chose to resell his copies, and the basis on which the price of the additional copies purchased by him was calculated. Heywood's clear statement in the passage concerning Baptismal Bonds Renewed quoted above indicates that he regarded the gratis distribution of his works as an integral part of his pastoral cure, though even in this case twenty-eight copies were sent to the bookseller Francis Bentley and six are noted as having been purchased by John Armitage for 11/-. His diary reference quoted earlier to the distribution of Heart Treasure would again seem to imply that the copies were a gift to their recipients. In the case of Christ Displayed , 112 copies were passed on for resale to Bentley and there is a list of sums totaling £2/6/0 received on a varying unit basis from seven other individuals. This however was not one of Heywood's own books and its publication was probably regarded by all concerned in it as a charitable exercise for the benefit of the author's widow. Towards the end of his career, when Heywood was once again securely established in a permitted meeting house, he seems to have developed a closer relationship with the local book trade. A letter to Ralph Thoresby accompanying a copy of a A New Creature requests his aid in the "furtherance of its sale" by John Whitworth, a bookseller of Leeds who was subsequently joint-publisher with Parkhurst of A Treatise of Christ's Intercession ( Works , I, 435). In general, however, the indications are that at the period when Heywood was a persecuted exile from the pulpit, his books were designed for free distribution, a decision that is a testimony to his seriousness of purpose in straitened times. As regards the prices paid by Heywood to his publishers, the indications are that they represent a substantial discount. It is even possible that he enjoyed the benefit customary at a later date of a special reduction for religious books intended for gratis distribution, though there is no direct evidence of this among the surviving records. Life in God's Favour which Heywood purchased bound for 11d is advertised bound in the Term Catalogue for Easter 1672 at 1/6d. Similarly Heavenly Converse which Heywood bought at 4½d in sheets and 6½d bound is advertised bound in the Term Catalogue for Michaelmas 1697 at 1/-. 9 Unfortunately neither of these titles was handled by Parkhurst, who while a copious advertiser in the Term Catalogues—often in blocks of up to twenty or more titles—does not as a rule specify prices; nevertheless it is difficult to imagine Heywood remaining so constant if he were not receiving the kinds of discount offered by Newman and Back. In the case of Heart Treasure , as the first work of an unknown author, Parkhurst may not have been so generous. The 1/8d charged Heywood for a bound small octavo of twenty-two sheets does not compare particularly favorably with the publicly advertised bound price of 2/- for two Parkhurst publications of 1669 in the same format, Ralph Venning's Sin the Plague of Plagues and John Crump's The Parable of the Great Supper Opened , both of twenty-four sheets, or with the 1/6d asked in the same year for Thomas Watson's Heaven Taken by Storm of fourteen and a half sheets. Thomas Wadsworth's Antipsychothanasia (1671) containing thirteen sheets and advertised at 2/- offers a more favorable comparison. Closer calculations taking account of en-totals and paper quality might help resolve the matter, but would only be of significance if we knew whether or not Parkhurst's price to Heywood included the cost of carriage to the North.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Thomas Parkhurst was bound apprentice to John Clark II on 24 June 1645 and became a freeman of the stationers' company on 3 July 1654. 10 He was active as a publisher from 1655 to 1711, issuing under his imprint from the Golden Bible on London Bridge and the Bible and Three Crowns in Cheapside close to a thousand titles of a predominantly theological character. That he should have been approached by Heywood to publish Heart Treasure was primarily, it can be assumed, the result of religious affinity. John Dunton, who had served his apprenticeship under Parkhurst, speaks of him as "the most eminent Presbyterian Bookseller, in the Three King-doms"—John Laurence, another ex-apprentice, being the second—and as "Scrupulously Honest in all his Dealings" ( Life , p. 281). Heywood seems to have been generally contented with Parkhurst, his only stated causes of complaint being irregularities in delivery. In a letter to his son of 25 April 1693, he complained "he hath printed Parents advice—sent down 100 but by Tom-long-carrier J.P. cannot find them, tho he and I haue notice of them, but no mention of carriers name: I partly chide Mr Park. yet will not leaue him, as Dr. Sampson Adviseth, we are well, my wife longs to see you" (IV, 172). Heywood's characteristically erratic punctuation fails to clarify whether Dr [Henry] Sampson's advice referred to Parkhurst (and if so whether favorably or unfavorably) or to the state of health of the elder Heywoods; however it may be significant that Heywood gave Job's Appeal (1695) to Brabazon Aylmer—characterised by Dunton ( Life , p. 282) as "a very just and Religious Man"—and Heavenly Converse (1697) to John Back, though also continuing to publish with Parkhurst. At an earlier period, Heywood entered an irritated memorandum regarding a consignment of his brother's Christ Displayed made up with eight volumes "not of the right sort"—viz "1. Medes Ast Christian, 2 glorious Lovers in verse, 3 Mr Corbets book of Chts Kingdom 4, 4 Glimpses of Eternity 2." 11 On the other hand, the parcel also contained an additional eight free copies of "glimpse of eternity," and in 1701 there was a gift of "aboue twenty books" on devotional subjects from Parkhurst to his by now well-known author (IV, 262). It is highly probable that on his visits to London Heywood was a purchaser of books other than his own though the only reference of this kind in the memoranda is to "2 dozen of Prot Catich" received from Parkhurst on 28 June 1673 (III, 73). On 12 February 1671, he purchased a ream of paper from Parkhurst for 6/4d (III, 17). Although the terms of publication were, as we have seen, calculated to protect the publisher against loss, it is clear that even when Heywood had become an established author Parkhurst still had to approve a manuscript and that Heywood did not regard such approval as being automatic. In the letter of 25 April 1693, he mentions, apparently with reference to Advice to an Only Child , "another letter from Mr. Parkhurst who is willing to print it, only would see it first." Two months earlier, on 7 February 1692/3, he had recorded an unfavorable response from a bookseller who was probably not Parkhurst (under whose imprint both titles mentioned were to appear during 1693): 12 god hath also inabled me this year 1692 to write two Treatises, 1 The best Entail, or parents grounds of hope for their surviving children from 2 Sam 23 5 which I finished, sent up to be printed, but because paper was dear, they would not print it but upon unreasonable terms to me, therefore it came back to me and I haue it, 2 the other Family-altar upon gen 35 23 which I haue finisht and sent away Feb 4 9 2/3 whether it shal haue the same fate or no I know not, but this I can truely say I haue been industrious and spent my time for the good of the church, and chiefly for the glory of my good god (III, 263). Turner's edition of the manuscripts and Vint's Works include a number of unpublished treatises which may have been similarly submitted and rejected. Indeed, Heywood's review of his actions during 1696 records the completion of six treatises "but none printed, except Job's Appeal in 95" (III, 267). In November 1676, he had described himself as "busy about preparing my book of louetoken for the presse" (III, 148)—but without success. The "Last Diary," (IV, 184-305) running from October 1699 to 29 April 1702—five days before his death—records work on more than twenty treatises and lives, only two of which achieved contemporary publication. Several of these, however, were contributions to Sampson's projected account of non-conformist ministers (subsequently incorporated into Calamy's) while others appear to have been intended from the start for private distribution in manuscript. On one occasion recorded among Heywood's "Experiments" we see Parkhurst acting as a censor. The episode is worth quoting at length as an illustration both of the hazards attending the publication of non-conformist divinity and the pleasantly unhurried relationship of the London bookseller and his north-country author: Coming to London Dec 29 1682 and immediatly after going to Mr Tho: Parkhurst, my Bookseller to whom I had sent a Manuscript several months before, called Israels Lamentation after the Lord, on 1 Sam 72 wch I made account had been printed, but he had not begun it tho he designed the printing of it, being incouraged by some ministers in London, he resolved presently to set about it, and print it before I went out of town wch he did, only in reading the Epistle he found some smart reflections wch (hauing sent for me) he communicated to me, thinking it was not safe to print them, being then a very hazardous time, upon reading them I thought so too, so expunged them, which I am heartily glad I did, for when it came down into the country, Dr H[ook] sent for it and greedily, (and I fear captiously) read it over, sd it was a seditious piece, another sd it was full of faction, consulting with his clergy they all censured it deeply, yea Justice H[orton?] had it and Sir J K[aye] and a confident story was brought me from Halifax that on Munday April 16 1683 the justices met at Huthersfield to consider of my Book, I was also summoned to the sessions that week, tho not on that account, my feares were great (III, 335-336; cf. IV, 111). Heywood refers to the cause of offence as a passage in which he had written "that a law was made to thrust out 2000 ministers Aug 24 1662" (III, 336) which was open to condemnation as a "complaining of the laws." The reference seems to be the following passage on A2 r : All Israel have transgressed thy Law . . . therefore hast thou brought upon us a great Evil, such as hath scarce ever been done under the whole Heaven; not three Shepherds cut off in a month, but some thousands in one day, and then not for a day, or month, or year, but even twenty years already. The preface, which is dated two days before the twentieth anniversary of the "Black Bartholomew" of 1662, goes on to identify the fate of the Israelites in bondage with that of the ejected ministers with a boldness suggesting that Heywood in his Yorkshire isolation had totally misgauged the strength of the nation's swing towards Toryism during the preceding year. It seems likely that without Parkhurst's intervention the repercussions would have been quite as serious as Heywood feared. The hint that Parkhurst circulated the manuscript to London clerics acting as publisher's readers is an interesting one and seems to reflect a regular practice. In a letter to Ralph Thoresby of 25 November 1695, Heywood ( Works , I, 435) complains of the London ministers having "expunged" material from the extracts from John Angier's diaries included as a postscript to The Holy Life and Happy Death . Parkhurst's advisers will almost certainly have included the celebrated John Howe of whom he is described by Dunton ( Life , p. 281) as "a great Admirer, and constant Hearer" and who with John Starkey supplied a laudatory preface to Heywood's A Family-Altar in 1693. Heywood appears also to have circulated his works among Northern ministers before sending them to London, launching "A Scriptural Fast," which was to remain unpublished, with the comment to Thoresby "I have lately written a Treatise on a Scriptural Fast , being desired to do it. My son John hath it. If I have any encouragement, [I] shall send it to the press." 13 He was himself in his later years the recipient of a steady flow of manuscripts for comment and "encouragement" ( Works , I, 428-442 passim ). While the relationship, financial and otherwise, between Heywood and Parkhurst was to some extent conditioned by geographical and sectarian factors, the picture it presents of an author writing explicitly and voluminously for the edification of his flock, distributing large numbers of copies at his own expense, advising other authors on their manuscripts, maintaining a substantial private lending library of devotional works, and in effect acting as an energetic unpaid publicist for the productions of the London book trade is unlikely to have been unique and may even have been typical of a substantial body among the 1800 ejected clergy who maintained an active ministry, and of a significant though probably smaller proportion of conformists. The question that arises is whether the country clergyman may not have been an even more important force in the distribution of books outside London than the country bookseller. And what bookseller can we imagine declaring with the fervency of Heywood in the Dedication to Heart Treasure : " Blessed be God for good Books " (A2[=A3] v )?</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Robert Dodsley as Editor by Richard Wendorf</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the considerable amount of bibliographical work which has been devoted to Robert Dodsley and his Collection of Poems , surprisingly little attention has been paid to Dodsley's role as an editor of eighteenth-century poetry. 1 That an examination of editorial influence should focus on Dodsley is natural for several reasons. He was, after all, the doyen of mid eighteenth-century London publishers. It was Johnson who paid tribute to Dodsley's treatment of authors by claiming that "Doddy, you know, is my patron." 2 In an age in which literary patronage had largely been abandoned by the aristocracy, it was to the publisher (and former footman) Dodsley that "literary adventurers" like Johnson and Collins addressed themselves. Much information about Dodsley has fortunately survived, some of it through the care of the poet William Shenstone, who preserved the vigorous correspondence between himself and his good friend. The evidence itself, however, is often contradictory and points to Dodsley's peculiar position as editor, publisher, and self-taught man of letters. It is clear that Dodsley took considerable care in preparing his authors' works for the press; whether he in fact took too much care in some cases is a question closely related to his editorial zeal and to his own conception of himself as poet and dramatist. The substantive readings of his poets' texts were often altered when they appeared in the Collection , and their accidentals almost always modified to agree with its distinctive "house style." The following observations, although they should provide a much more substantial portrait of Dodsley as editor, are offered in the expectation that, in answering some questions, they will raise others. Of Dodsley's publications, A Collection of Poems by Several Hands (1748-58) is of primary importance in determining the kinds of influence the bookseller could have had on poetical texts. The Collection itself is a major document in eighteenth-century taste, a diverse mixture of poetry in which Pope was accompanied by Tickell, Johnson by Chesterfield, Collins by Stephen Duck. 3 It was Dodsley's purpose, as he stated in the "Advertisement" to the first edition, "to preserve to the Public those poetical performances, which seemed to merit a longer remembrance, than what would probably be secured to them by the Manner wherein they were originally published" (I, 1). Many of the poems in the miscellany, moreover, were offered to the public for the first time. Gray's "Ode on the Spring" and "Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat" were transmitted to Dodsley by Horace Walpole, a mutual friend, and they first appeared anonymously in the Collection in 1748. The five poems by Collins which appeared in the first and fourth volumes, however, had already been published in his Odes or in An Epistle: Addrest to Sir Thomas Hanmer ; but it was Dodsley who was responsible for keeping these poems in print until Collins' work was collected in 1763 and 1765. The age owed to these volumes, more than to anything else, R. W. Chapman has written, "its knowledge of some poems which are still famous. Gray's poems were not collected in a popular form until 1768, Johnson's not until 1785," Chapman continues, "but The Vanity of Human Wishes , the Drury-Lane Prologue , and some of Gray's Odes were universally accessible because they were in Dodsley. If this were not borne in mind, the bibliographical evidence would suggest that the Vanity , like the Eton Ode and Collins's Ode to Evening , must have been almost forgotten for twenty years or more." 4 In selecting the poems for his Collection , Dodsley was influenced by settled reputation as well as by the opinion of literary middle-men like Walpole, Shenstone, and Joseph Spence. According to W. P. Courtney, who compiled a book-length study of Dodsley's miscellany, "Most of the pieces composing these volumes were submitted to the judgment of George, the first Lord Lyttelton, before they were passed for printing. . . . Many poems were inserted in the third and the later volumes from members of New College, Oxford, who had passed through their school education at Winchester College, and these were probably supplied through Spence, Dodsley's warm friend for many years, and a member of both these establishments." 5 According to Dodsley's biographer Ralph Straus, much of the success of the Collection was in fact due to "Dodsley's personal friendships with the authors, and to their active assistance." 6 Dodsley's correspondence during the years of the Collection is filled with his attempts to charm, cajole, or reason his authors into the kind of assistance he needed. Intent on publishing Shenstone's elegies, Dodsley wrote: "Upon my word, Sir, if you do not bring me up these mourning Muses, nothing elegant will come from Tully's Head this season. I shall loose the Fame of being the Muses' Midwife, &amp; my hand for want of practice will forget its obstetrick faculties" (BL Add. MS. 28959, f. 49). Poor Dodsley, Straus writes, "was at times hard put to it to keep his temper with his scattered band of poets" (p. 103), especially when he experienced difficulty in retrieving proof from leisurely authors like his friend Shenstone. Dodsley wrote to Shenstone in 1758, concerning volumes five and six of the Collection : "I had expected every day for some time to have receiv'd the two remaining Sheets from You, when behold another Letter came without a Proof! Ah, dear M r . Shenstone! consider what a sad situation I am in—big with twins , at my full time , and no hopes of your assistance to deliver me! Was ever man in such a situation before?" (BL Add. MS. 28959, f. 92). But the poets themselves, as their letters to each other attest, were often hard pressed to keep their tempers with Dodsley, and it is this kind of friction between bookseller and writer which allows us a closer view of Dodsley's editorial practices. The poets asserted that Dodsley not only chose to print what he wanted, but sometimes altered their poems as well, an alteration of substantives that obviously has a direct bearing on several important midcentury poetical texts. Although information does not survive concerning each of the contributors to Dodsley's miscellany, it is nevertheless possible to clarify Dodsley's editorial policy by analyzing his treatment of the poets Dyer, Gray, and Shenstone. 7 The country clergyman John Dyer had two poems, "Grongar Hill" and "The Ruins of Rome," published in the first edition of Dodsley's Collection (1748). 8 Dyer, an ill man by 1756, still had hopes that his poem The Fleece might be accepted by Dodsley, although he admitted that "people are so taken up with politics, and have so little inclination to read anything but satire and newspapers, I am in doubt whether this is a proper time for publishing it." Nevertheless, with the assistance and enthusiasm of Mark Akenside and Joseph Warton, Dyer sent the poem on to Dodsley and it was published 15 March 1757. In a letter to a friend, Dyer recorded his reaction to the edition: "Mr Dodsley, I think, has performed his part well; but in one or two places there have happened such alterations of the copy, as make me give my reader false precepts. . . . I will not trouble you with any . . . corrections, but I will Mr Dodsley, lest a second edition should happen." In his letter to Dodsley, Dyer pointed out the mistakes caused by Dodsley's ignorance of the methods of "us graziers," and expressed his hope that "these remarks will be agreeable to you. If you are inclined to make use of them, or any others, which I may send you, be pleased to acquaint me." Dyer died in December, however, and a corrected edition of The Fleece was never published. Dodsley's treatment of The Fleece prompted Straus to note "that on several occasions Dodsley seems to have trusted his own judgment and sense of rhythm rather than the manuscript given to him for publication. That he was justified in such a course is open to question, but one may imagine him reading to a circle of friends the latest parcel to arrive, and then and there pencilling such alterations as seemed to please the company" (p. 110). But whereas Dodsley and his company may have been pleased with the alterations, a man like Dyer, whose poem was in part a technical treatise (on sheep-raising and the wool trade), had reason to complain at his falsified "precepts," even though Dodsley himself was a poet with a considerable reputation in the 1740's. Gray's immediate reaction to the Collection was not to any changes Dodsley might have made in the printing of his poems but to the aesthetic appearance of the miscellany itself. In January or February 1748 he wrote to Walpole: "I am obliged to you for Mr. Dodsley's book, and, having pretty well looked it over, will (as you desire) tell you my opinion of it. He might, methinks, have spared the Graces in his frontispiece, if he chose to be œconomical, and dressed his authors in a little more decent raiment—not in whited-brown paper and distorted characters, like an old ballad. I am ashamed to see myself; but the company keeps me in countenance." 9 Perhaps as a result of Gray's remarks, Dodsley replaced the three graces which formed the title-page's vignette with one of Apollo and the nine Muses in the second and subsequent editions. Dodsley had apparently made some alterations to the poems themselves, but Gray makes no mention of these. The two odes ("On the Spring" and "On the Death of a Favourite Cat") had been transmitted to Dodsley by Walpole, who had taken the text from Gray's letters to him. Walpole had already been responsible for getting Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College" into print (it was published by Dodsley in 1747), and, in his characteristically coy way, Gray seems not to have been averse to having these two other pieces published as well: "As to my Eton Ode, Mr. Dodsley is padrone ," he wrote to Walpole; "The second you had, I suppose you do not think worth giving him: otherwise, to me it seems not worse than the former. He might have Selima too, unless she be of too little importance for his patriot-collection; or perhaps the connections you had with her may interfere. Che se io ?" (Letter 142). Gray sent a copy of the "Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat" to both Walpole (Letter 134) and Thomas Wharton (Letter 135). The Walpole text has not survived, but it is reasonable to believe that it was very similar, but probably not identical, to the text in his letter to Wharton (which differs at several points from the original text in Gray's Commonplace Book). The comparison to be made is therefore between the texts of the poem in the Collection and in Gray's letter to Wharton. When "Selima" was inserted into the Collection , several noticeable alterations had been made to Gray's manuscript: lines four and five had been transposed; "Her Coat" was changed to "The coat" in line ten; "averse to" in line 24 became "a foe to fish"; and line 36 was changed from "A Fav'rite has no friend!" to "What fav'rite has a friend!" That these changes were apparently Dodsley's responsibility and not Gray's is indicated by later printings of the poem. In Designs by Mr. R. Bentley for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray (Dodsley, 1753) and Poems by Mr. Gray (published by James Dodsley in 1768), both of which were supervised by Gray, these changes were replaced by the manuscript readings in the letter to Wharton. These variants were also corrected in later editions of the Collection , with the exception of "The coat" in line ten. 10 Much later, when preparing new editions of his poems in 1768, Gray mentioned "several blunders of the press" in Dodsley's previous printings of the poems in the Collection . 11 Gray was not as reticent, however, about Dodsley's handling of his "Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard." Dodsley's printing of the "Elegy" was of course a race against time. Walpole's wide circulation of the poem resulted in a letter from the publisher William Owen to Gray implying that the poem would soon appear in his Magazine of Magazines . Faced with this unpleasant prospect, Gray instructed Walpole to offer it to Dodsley: "I have but one bad Way left to escape the Honour they would inflict upon me. &amp; therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley print it immediately (w ch may be done in less than a Week's time) from your Copy, but without my Name, in what Form is most convenient for him, but in his best Paper &amp; Character. he must correct the Press himself, &amp; print it without any Interval between the Stanza's, because the Sense is in some Places continued beyond them; &amp; the Title must be, Elegy, wrote in a Country Church-yard" (Letter 157). And yet in spite of his detailed instructions, Gray was not entirely pleased with Dodsley's publication. He remarked to Walpole (20 February 1751): "Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or two in the cradle, that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long as it lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her hands before now; and besides, it will only look the more careless, and by accident as it were" (Letter 158). Gray's previous "suffering" clearly points to Dodsley's handling of his odes in the Collection three years earlier, and presumably to the miscellany's appearance as well. As for the "pinches" which Dodsley had inflicted this time, Gray made some remarks in a subsequent letter to Walpole: "The chief errata were sacred bower for secret ; hidden for kindred (in spite of dukes and classicks); and frowning as in scorn for smiling ." 12 These possibly are errata: the rapid printing of the poem would aggravate compositors' errors and leave little time for editorial revision. But at the least Dodsley's own contributions appear to be the slight indentation of the first line of each stanza (although he did not separate them), and the addition of the funereal borders of skulls, bones, hour-glass, spade, and crown (which were employed through the twelfth edition in 1763). 13 In his later dealings with Dodsley, Gray often provided specific instructions for his publications which compromised his bookseller's enterprising spirit; Dodsley, however, remained an invariably accommodating publisher. When Gray revised his "Elegy" in 1752, the poet read proof on a publication for the first time (Letter 170). Dodsley wanted to number each stanza in the poem; Gray objected, and the stanzas remained unnumbered. When Dodsley published Designs by Mr. R. Bentley for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray he wanted Gray's name to appear at the top of the title-page, but the poet insisted on the illustrator's pre-eminence and again got his own way (Letter 172). Dodsley also hoped to boost the volume's sales by prefixing the poems with Gray's portrait, but once again the poet remonstrated—this time to Walpole—and the engraving was suppressed (Letter 173). Finally, when Robert's brother James Dodsley, by 1768 the head of the firm, asked Gray if he could bring out a smaller edition of his poems, the poet consented, but with specific instructions: "all I desire is, that the text be accurately printed, &amp; therefore whoever corrects the press, should have some acquaintance with the Greek, Latin, &amp; Italian, as well as the English, tongues" (Letter 465). In his meticulousness, his pretended indifference to publication, and his distance from the world of London publishing, Gray was in many ways an anomalous contributor to Tully's Head. Gray apparently wrote directly to Dodsley twice only, and met him no oftener. 14 For a fuller view of Dodsley's editorial practice we must look at the career of William Shenstone. Although Shenstone resembled Gray in many ways, especially in his retirement and his attention to literary detail, he was also Dodsley's close friend. In return for the lampreys, porter, and tea which his publisher sent him, Shenstone replied with a steady flow of his own poems and those of his friends, often accompanied by revisions, proof-sheets, and news of his literary circle. Dodsley published Shenstone's The Judgment of Hercules in 1741, and acted as agent for The School-mistress the following year. When he was preparing the first three volumes of his Collection , Dodsley decided to include The School-mistress as it was, taking his copy from the 1742 edition. Shenstone, however, who had apparently been tinkering with his poem for six years, expressed his displeasure to Lady Luxborough: "As to Dodsley's Collection I find it is approv'd on all Hands; tho' I should have been much better pleas'd with him, if he had giv'n me previous notice e'er he publish'd my Schoolmistress; that I might have spruc'd her up a little before she appeared in so much Company. They tell me he purposes a second Edition concerning w ch I have wrote to him." 15 Shenstone was even more blunt with his friend and fellow poet Richard Jago: "I am afraid, by your account, that Dodsley has published my name to the School-mistress. I was a good deal displeased at his publishing that poem without my knowledge, when he had so many opportunities of giving me some previous information; but, as he would probably disregard my resentment, I chose to stifle it, and wrote to him directly upon the receipt of yours, that I would be glad to furnish him with an improved copy of the School-mistress. &amp;c. for his second edition" (Letter LXIV). In printing from the 1742 edition, Dodsley was of course faithful to his poet's text; all that he failed to take into consideration were his author's altered intentions. Shenstone consulted with his friends Graves, Whistler, and Jago; revised his poem to their mutual satisfaction; and sent it off in time for the second edition. By 1759, however, Shenstone must have changed his opinion of second editions, for we find Dodsley having to argue rather forcefully on their behalf: "And now I come to your exclamation ag st Second Editions, with Additions &amp; Alterations. I shall dispatch this point in a very few words. Would you have an Author, after he has once publish'd, ty'd up from correcting his errors, or improving his Work? Second thoughts you know are said to be the best, &amp; therefore second Editions corrected, are no bad things—I speak as a Bookseller" (BL Add. MS. 28959, f. 115). Dodsley did not, of course, speak just as a bookseller. Perhaps because he was a writer himself, certainly because he understood his authors, he appealed to Shenstone in terms the poet would appreciate; his argument is based not on increased sales but on the improvement of the author's work. Because they respected Dodsley's poetical integrity, and because they did not have the time themselves, Shenstone and his friends allowed their bookseller an unusual amount of discretion in the final preparation of their poetry for the fourth volume of the Collection in 1755. A long letter to Jago, however, shows how uneasy Shenstone was with this arrangement, especially since he was submitting his friends' pieces (as well as his own) to Dodsley's judgment: "I am thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future, unless I have the company of my friends when I send to the press. Hurried as I then was, I sent up your two copies, and what I proposed for him of my own, with a kind of discretionary power to select the best readings. How you would approve of this measure I knew not; but I had this to plead in my behalf, that D[odsley] was a person of taste himself ; that he had, as I imagined, many learned friends to assist him; that his interest was concerned in the perfection of his Miscellany; and that I submitted my own pieces to the same judgement" (Letter CLXXVII). Thus beneath Shenstone's anxiety in the letter we are able to detect his basic trust in Dodsley, another "person of taste," especially in regard to the handling of his own poetry. 16 Dodsley, for his part, seems to have been as conscientious as Shenstone had hoped: "I have spent this whole day amongst your Papers &amp; those of your friends," he wrote to the poet, "&amp; have put them as nearly in the order you desire as I can. I hope to send you prooft sheets of the whole of them before next week is out, which I beg you will correct &amp; send back by the return of the Post. I have impertinently attempted to alter one Stanza of Lady Luxborough's, which pray restore to its original reading if you like it better" (BL Add. MS. 28959, ff. 22-23). But Shenstone's uneasiness continued, especially when he corresponded with Lady Luxborough: "I have expected to see Dodsley's miscellany advertis'd these six weeks ago. Had he allow'd me but one Half of this time to deliberate, I could have adjusted the share we have in it much more to my satisfaction. I know but little what he has finally done, in pursuance of that discretionary Power with which I, thro' absolute Haste, found it requisite to intrust him; and that possibly at a time when his own Hurry was as great as mine " (Letter CLXXIX). Part of Shenstone's trepidation, however, lay in the fact that he too had tampered with Lady Luxborough's verses and was now hoping that Dodsley had restored the original readings: "And if he have not done so, universally (as I apprehend may be the Case) the Fault may be repair'd in some future Impression, &amp; is, even now, not altogether mine " (Letter CLXXIX). Dodsley, on his part, acknowledged his responsibility: "I am in some pain for those different readings which you left so imprudently to my determination but I have done as well as I could, &amp; have generally thought it the best way to follow where you seem'd to point" (BL Add. MS. 28959, f. 37). As late as March 1755 Shenstone wrote to Dodsley in the hope that the edition might be delayed and the verses revised again, but by the twenty-first he had received his copy and was communicating his reaction to Richard Graves: "I wish the last Stanza of Whistler's Verses upon Flowers had remained as he himself wrote it: but being somewhat dissatisfied with the original Reading, and having no Time left to improve it myself, I left it to D------, who I think has made it worse; however, in this Respect, and some others, it may be proper to fix one's Eye upon a subsequent Impression; and Dodsley has acted as discreetly as it was possible for him to do, considering what instructions were given him, and how much was left to his Discretion" (Letter CLXXXII). Two days later Shenstone acknowledged his receipt of the volume to Dodsley and politely complimented him on his work: "I am oblig'd to you for the care you took to forward it, when printed, as well as for all that Trouble I occasion'd you, before . Some Improvements may be made in a subsequent Impression; &amp; whenever this is propos'd I dare say you will give me notice. In general, you have done all that I could expect from a Person of Genius and a Friend" (Letter CLXXXIII). In spite of his previous anxieties, Shenstone became the principal contributor to (and liaison for) the final two volumes of the Collection , published in 1758. In a letter to his friend Thomas Percy, we find that both Shenstone and Dodsley have been tinkering with Percy's contributions; but Shenstone is now more eager to see that Percy himself has the last word: "I recollected that Mr Dodsley &amp; myself had formerly taken some Pains, (and, I believe, some Liberties too), with the Pieces to which you alluded. Be this as it will, you are most evidently in y e right for not adopting implicitly what was done in your absence; nor can Mr. Dodsley or myself wish to debarr you of a Privilege, which, on a similar occasion, we should be so ready to demand Ourselves " (Letter CCXV). In his own dealings with Dodsley, however, Shenstone was now much more willing to trust to his publisher's final judgment: "In regard to the Song 'I told my nymph' I desire y t you would follow all y e readings you propose. (The same, as to y e Compliment 1743.) As to y e Ode 1739. I am neither wholly satisfy'd with y r reading or my own " (Letter CCXIV). Shenstone therefore included both his original first stanza and an altered one and left the final choice to Dodsley: I. 'Twas not by Beauty's aid alone That Love usurp'd his [Fancy'd] [Airy] throne, His [fancy'd] [magic] powr display'd His tyrant sceptre sway'd Which &amp;c. II. 'Twas not thro' Beauty's aid alone, That Love's insidious pow'r was known Or ever breast, betray'd A mutual kindness, &amp;c. Although Shenstone preferred the altered stanza, Dodsley's final version most closely follows the first and includes several changes of his own: 'Twas not by beauty's aid alone, That love usurp'd his airy throne, His boasted power display'd: 'Tis kindness that secures his aim, 'Tis hope that feeds the kindling flame, Which beauty first conveyed. (V, 34) At this stage Dodsley's and Shenstone's correspondence and their frequent visits together approximate a form of poetical collaboration. If Dodsley supplied the final touches to Shenstone's work, so too Shenstone read and criticized Dodsley's Melpomene (1757) and Cleone (1759, to which he helped add an epilogue; see Letter CXCVI), and also revised his friend's Fables (1761). As a reviser Shenstone placed himself in the same precarious position in which he had formerly found Dodsley: "You will observe, that I take great liberties with the Fables you ask me to revise," he wrote to Graves; "Dodsley must think me very fantastical or worse , while I was correcting those he wrote at The Leasowes.— I find my ear much more apt to take offence than most other people's; and, as his is far less delicate than mine, he must of course believe, in many places, that I altered merely for alteration's sake" (Letter CCXLIX). Even Horace Walpole took an active interest in Dodsley's poetry, as he indicated in a letter concerning the unsuccessful Agriculture : "I am sorry you think it any trouble to peruse your poem again; I always read it with pleasure. One or two little passages I have taken the liberty to mark and to offer you alterations . . . I don't know whether you will think my emendations for the better. I beg in no wise that you will adopt any of them out of complaisance; I only suggest them to you at your desire, and am far from insisting on them." 17 But Agriculture , like Dyer's The Fleece , never saw a revised edition. Thus Dodsley's correspondence with his authors (and Shenstone in particular) reveals how carefully he worked as editor and publisher to obtain the best possible edition for his publications, and to correct errors in earlier editions. Not all of Dodsley's authors were in agreement, of course; Dr. John Brown suggested to Dodsley that "If such a thing is practicable . . . I would have a printed Copy [of Honour ] sent down by way of Proof, as I cannot expect that You in the hurry of Business should revise it with that Care, as an Author does his own Productions." 18 John Hoadly in fact argued that Dodsley was too hurried to present accurate texts of poems in the Collection : "I beg the Favour of You to take upon yourself the correct printing of what little pieces of mine there are in it; as they were most shamefully neglected in the last Edition [1755], even to y e . leaving out whole Lines; to the utter Confusion of Grammar, Sense, and what some Poets might resent more—even Rhime." 19 And in the following month (8 March 1758) Hoadly again reproached his publisher: "I am much surpriz'd to see You advertise, to publish this Month; for except what Pieces you have had corrected by y e . Authors themselves, (which I think I can plainly trace,) y e . Volumes are miserably printed. . . . For my sake, let y e . Pieces taken from my Volumes be corrected; or People will think I don't understand common Grammar" (Bodleian MS. Eng. Letters d. 40, ff. 111-112). But most of Dodsley's authors appear to have agreed with John Gilbert Cooper who, in reference to his essays in The Museum , wished that Dodsley "would write it concert with me in the humorous papers, that is, make any addition, altaration, amendment etc as you think proper, for I know nobody's taste I can more rely upon than yours." 20 The letters of his authors to him, especially when they suggest revisions for Dodsley's own writing, in turn reveal relationships which were founded upon mutual respect. Dodsley's editorial privilege consisted mostly of suggestion; his authors usually had the last word. When they were somewhat displeased with the final results, as Shenstone and his friends were, it was in fact often due to the extensive discretionary power which they had put in Dodsley's hands. For Gray, moreover, it was predominantly a comfortable relationship; the discretion (or indiscretion) of Dodsley as padrone enabled the poet to indicate his own indifference towards publication. It is clear that this discretionary power often caught Dodsley between the roles of author and publisher. On the one hand, because he was a successful poet and playwright, he was inclined to value (perhaps too highly) his own literary judgment. On the other hand, again because he was an author himself, he maintained respect for a writer's literary property and for the integrity of a literary work. The evidence suggests that Dodsley's band of authors was for the most part pleased with his editorial practice. When Dodsley did alter his writers' texts, as he did Lady Luxborough's, he was usually prompt in pointing out his initiative and asking for approval. And when in fact Dodsley had the final word on any text, his authors could rely on his fierce partisanship for corrected second editions. Dodsley, meanwhile, was clearly open to the suggestions made to him by writers like Gray and Shenstone. These are substantive changes, however; when we turn to Dodsley's treatment of accidentals we find ourselves on much less solid ground. Although Dodsley can usually be depended upon to preserve his authors' wording (or at least to point to his alterations), his presentation of accidentals often seems to be his own (or that of his compositors). 21 This is particularly true of the Collection , which has a distinctive house style that is noticeably different even from Dodsley's earlier and later publications. We have seen that Dodsley was willing to follow Gray's detailed instructions concerning the substantives of his text, but with the accidentals the bookseller often wished to print for himself. 22 Dodsley's tampering with accidentals is apparent in his presentation of Gray's three poems in the Collection . A comparison of Gray's manuscript version of the "Ode on the Spring" in a letter to Walpole with its presentation in the Collection shows that Dodsley usually replaced Gray's capitalization of nouns with lower-case letters, and some place-name nouns with small capitals (Letter 125). Thus "Hours" (l. 1) became "hours," "Crowd" (l. 18) became "crowd," and "Attick" (l. 5) became "Attic." When these poems were reprinted in 1753 and 1768, however, each of these adjustments in the Collection was replaced by Gray's original manuscript reading. Occasionally a capitalized noun was not changed in the Collection , as in "Contemplation's sober eye" ("Ode on the Spring," l. 31); but in the second and subsequent editions of the miscellany the normalization had its effect and the word became "contemplation's." Capitalization and punctuation in the 1753 and 1768 versions of both "Ode on the Spring" and "Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat" are irregular, however: the Collection sometimes has a word capitalized which is lower-case in the 1753 and 1768 editions, but usually this situation is reversed. In the "Eton" ode, for instance, which Dodsley first published in folio in 1747, most nouns are capitalized and place-names are italicized. The capitals are dropped in the version in the Collection , and usually only the personifications are re-capitalized in the later editions. The italicized nouns, meanwhile—" Henry 's" (l. 4), " Windsor 's" (l. 6), " Thames " (l. 9)—are reduced to non-italicized small capitals in both the Collection and later editions. Finally, the stanzaic presentation of the "Ode on the Spring" in the Collection is unique. Gray ran the lines on in his manuscript; in the 1753 and 1768 editions the stanzas were separated but without any numbering; in the Collection the stanzas were separated and numbered by Roman numeral. Dodsley's treatment of Collins' poems in the Collection is similar. In the "Ode, to a Lady" for instance—which Dodsley had first published in his Museum (1746), and which then appeared in revised form in the Odes (Millar, 1747) and the Collection (2nd ed., 1748)—the two printings which Dodsley supervised are alike in many ways, and at first glance one might conjecture that Dodsley used his Museum version as copy-text when he included the poem in the Collection . The details of punctuation are very similar, but in capitalization and italics the Museum version is actually much more closely followed by Millar's Odes . Italics disappear in the Collection , although small capitals often take their place; capitalization of nouns, including personifications, is generally eliminated. The stanzas are indicated by Roman numerals in both the Museum and Collection texts; in the Odes they are preceded by Arabics (a characteristic of that publication). It is obvious that at some points Dodsley drew upon the Odes version, though, for punctuation as well as for the text itself. The following example, however, demonstrates Dodsley's usual practice. Museum (ll. 46-47): Ev'n humble H ------'s cottag'd Vale Shall learn the sad-repeated Tale, Odes (ll. 58-59): Ev'n humble Harting 's cottag'd Vale Shall learn the sad repeated Tale, Collection (ll. 46-47): Ev'n humble Harting's cottage vale Shall learn the sad-repeated tale, Here we can see Dodsley following his earlier punctuation, modifying its italics and capitals, augmenting a substantive from the version printed in the Odes ("Harting's"), and (deliberately?) altering another ("cottage"). These examples from Gray and Collins point to a consistency of style throughout the six volumes of the Collection . Italics are removed except in titles and footnotes, and even there italics become less frequent in later editions. The italics, in turn, are often replaced by small capitals. Punctuation is normalized, and spelling often modernized. The stanzas are separated, usually by Roman numerals (this had been true of Dodsley's Museum as well). And capitalization, even in the case of some personifications, is usually abandoned. Dodsley's removal of capitals, is, of course, part of a larger trend in printing in the late 1740's; 23 but it is also one solution to the problem of reprinting together a large number of poems whose authors (and whose editors) have widely differing practices affecting accidentals. As "house style," Dodsley's imposition of his own taste in the Collection works well, but it will not serve for the modern editor who wishes to present his poet's own accidentals. That this house style represented a solution to a particular problem is suggested by later editions of Gray's poetry. There, in the editions of 1753 and 1768, Gray's own stylistic preferences are restored. In the Collection , therefore, the text can usually be relied upon to represent an author's own work, or at least his compliance with his editor's revisions (unless external evidence proves otherwise); but the accidentals are certainly Dodsley's and his compositors'. If the scholarly editor's task is to choose a copy-text which approximates as closely as possible his author's own preferences in the presentation of accidentals, in this respect, then, he will have to approach Dodsley's Collection of Poems with caution, even as he learns to rely upon Dodsley's diligence as an editor and his zeal (for better or worse) for revised editions.</field>

Further references to this edition are often provided by letter in the text. 10 Several other discrepancies should be noted. In one instance ("Harry," l. 35) the text in the Collection follows the Wharton text but was changed (presumably by the author) to "Susan" in later printings of the miscellany and in Dodsley's 1753 and 1768 editions of Gray's poetry (it appeared first as "Susan" in Gray's Commonplace Book). At another point ("beauteous," l. 14) Dodsley's reading differs from both Wharton and the 1753 and 1768 editions ("angel"); "beauteous" is also the reading in the Commonplace Book, however, and therefore it was apparently the reading in Gray's letter to Walpole as well (which Dodsley followed). Finally, in two places ("looks," l. 25; "tempts," l. 40), Dodsley's readings differ from both the Commonplace Book and Gray's letter to Wharton: "Eye" ("Eyes" in Wharton); "strikes." Here, however, Dodsley's readings were preserved in the editions of Gray's poetry published in 1753 and 1768, and thus it seems safe to conclude that Gray had originally suggested these readings in his letter to Walpole. Despite the recent editions of Gray's poetry by H. W. Starr and J. R. Hendrickson (1966) and Roger Lonsdale (1969), the problems of textual transmission and determination of a copy-text for these poems appear not to have received a full textual discussion. 11 Letter 466, to James Beattie, who supervised the Foulis edition; see also Letter 465, to James Dodsley. 12 Letter 159. Gray also took Dodsley and his "matrons" to task for another variant, but he had in this case actually suggested the change and asked for Walpole's opinion (see Letters 157 and 159). Gray's attitude towards Dodsley in this series of letters suggests that Walpole himself was not responsible for the changes. 13 See Thomas Gray, An Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard , ed. F. G. Stokes (1929), pp. 19, 27, 34-35. 14 Letter 172; another letter to Dodsley (I, 366) has not survived.

Further references to this edition are provided by letter in the text. 16 Cf. Shenstone's description of his friend at the head of Dodsley's collected correspondence: "A Person whose writings I esteem in common with the Publick; But of whose Simplicity, Benevolence, Humanity, &amp; true Politeness, I have had repeated and particular experience" (BL Add. MS. 28959, f. 2). 17 The Letters of Horace Walpole , ed. Mrs. Paget Toynbee (1903), III, 195. 18 8 October 1743 (Bodleian MS. Toynbee d. 19, ff. 5-6); Honour was published in December 1743. 19 15 February 1758 (Bodleian MS. Eng. Letters d. 40, f. 113). 20 7 July 1746 (Bodleian MS. Eng. Misc. d. 174, p. 15); cf. also pp. 71-72, regarding Cooper's Letters Concerning Taste (1754): "as I know you are so fond of accurasy, I have taken uncommon Pains &amp; have polish'd these trifles as much as I was able." Thomas Lisle, who edited Edward Lisle's Observations in Husbandry (published by Dodsley in 1756), expressed similar confidence: "be so good as to correct what You find amiss in them, &amp; send them to the Press, without giving yourself the trouble of consulting me: I shall willingly stand to your amendments" (Bodleian MS. Eng. Letters d. 40, f. 107). 21 Dodsley altered both the accidentals and the substantives of early dramatic texts in compiling his Select Collection of Old Plays in 1744; see R. C. Bald, "Sir William Berkeley's The Lost Lady ," The Library , 4th ser., 17 (1937), 395-426, and A. T. Brissenden, "Dodsley's Copy-Text for The Revenger's Tragedy in his Select Collection ," The Library , 5th ser., 19 (1964), 254-258. Both Bald and Brissenden, drawing upon Dodsley's annotated copies of the texts, claim that he shared the role of normalizing accidentals with his compositors. 22 A similar case for alteration could be made for James Dodsley's handling of Gray's manuscripts (prepared for the printer) of "The Fatal Sisters," "The Descent of Odin," and "The Triumphs of Owen" when these pieces were included in Poems by Mr. Gray (1768). There is reason, of course, to believe that Gray "intended" his accidentals to follow the form Dodsley chose for them; this is his attitude, at least, towards the Foulis edition in 1768. Gray wrote to James Beattie: "please to observe, that I am entirely unversed in the doctrine of Stops , whoever therefore shall deign to correct them, will do me a friendly office: I wish I stood in need of no other correction" (Letter 466). 23 See Bertrand H. Bronson, Printing as an Index of Taste in Eighteenth-Century England (1958), reprinted in his Facets of the Enlightenment (1968), pp. 326-365. J. Smith, The Printer's Grammar (1755), indicates that authors themselves were sometimes given the choice of capitalization and italicization: "Before we actually begin to compose, we should be informed, either by the Author, or Master, after what manner our work is to be done; whether the old way, with Capitals to Substantives, and Italic to proper names; or after the more neat practice, all in Roman, and Capitals to Proper names, and Emphatical words" (p. 201); cited by Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), p. 339 n.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Mary Cochran : Sherwood Anderson's Ten-Year Novel by William S. Pfeiffer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Though famous for his short stories—and, in particular, for his collection of interrelated short stories, Winesburg, Ohio —Sherwood Anderson often tried to write successful novels. Unfortunately, none of his eight published novels received much critical attention and only one, Dark Laughter (1925), made much money. By the thirties, the last decade of his career, he mostly abandoned novel-writing and concentrated instead on short stories and nonfiction. Throughout these final years, however, Anderson saved the unpublished manuscript of one novel, Mary Cochran , that he had worked on much earlier in his career; and in 1947, seven years after her husband's death, Mrs. Sherwood Anderson included several folders of Mary Cochran typescript in the material she contributed to the Newberry Library in Chicago. Though these folders contain a fairly complete version of the novel, an 186-page typescript, they include no evidence that reveals a composition date. Therefore, my attempt to reconstruct the history of the composition of Mary Cochran depends instead upon 1) information in Anderson's published and unpublished letters and in a 1916 newspaper interview of Anderson, and 2) parallels between Anderson's experiences during the period of composition, on the one hand, and the characters, settings, and ideas presented in the novel, on the other. This evidence suggests that he began Mary Cochran between 1909 and 1912 in Ohio, continued work on it during the teens in Chicago, and stopped working on the novel only after he published two reworked Mary Cochran chapters in the short story collection, The Triumph of the Egg (1921). Yet most Anderson scholars who refer to the novel conclude that it is exclusively a product of the author's apprentice writing years in Ohio, before his move to Chicago in 1913. These works often draw support for a pre-1913 dating from the earliest critical study that discusses the genesis of Mary Cochran , Harry Hansen's Midwest Portraits (New York: Harcourt, 1923, pp. 117). According to Hansen, Anderson's early period, "a period of more nearly objective story-telling than the others, began in Ohio and resulted in the writing of four books: Windy McPherson's Son, Marching Men, Talbot Whittingham, and Mary Cochran ." Until recently, this account of the Ohio origin of Mary Cochran , first mentioned in Midwest Portraits and perpetuated in subsequent criticism, remained undocumented. Moreover, Anderson himself cast some doubt on the general accuracy of Hansen's book by writing to another critic in the twenties that "I detest Hansen's portrait. It is gossipy, unreliable, and I think pretty dull." 1 In mid-1975, however, the Newberry Library acquired some correspondence between Hansen and Anderson which supports Hansen's published account. In a late 1922 letter to Anderson, Hansen remarks that, "Here and there I find the report that at one time you were working on a book called 'Mary Cochran.' What became of it? Did you work it up into short stories? I find the character, of course, in 'The Triumph,'—or have you still the manuscript on hand and expect eventually to publish it?" (Newberry incoming, 20 Dec. 1922). In his eleven-page response, Anderson writes that, "When I came back to Chicago from my manufacturing adventure in Ohio about eight years ago I had four novels—Windy McPherson—Marching Men—a novel called Talbot Whittingham and one called Mary Cochran" (Newberry outgoing, undated). Although Anderson inaccurately recalls the date of the Chicago move—for eight years prior to the date of this letter would be early 1915, not early 1913 when the move actually occurred—his statement does clearly link Mary Cochran to the Ohio period. 2 In this letter to a prospective biographer, Harry Hansen, Anderson no doubt wished to draw the ascending curve of his career—from Mary Cochran and the other apprentice novels, to Winesburg, Ohio , and finally to the mature work of the period in which he was writing the letter. I would like to suggest that he did not mention portions of the genesis of Mary Cochran to Hansen because his failure to produce a satisfactory revision of the novel did not fit into this curve. Indeed, some of his remarks are clearly at odds with the few facts known about the novel's composition. At one point in the letter, for example, he refers to Mary Cochran as one of the "destroyed" early books, adding that he always "threw away such early work rather than attempt to rework it." And to Hansen's inquiry about the use of the Mary Cochran character in the 1921 The Triumph of the Egg short story collection, Anderson emphasizes the difference between the original novel and the published stories and does not mention the degree to which he transferred plot, characters, and direct quotations from one to the other: "Some of them [the early works] did remain living things in the world of my imagination and every now and then one of them pops up and insists on being put into a quite different story than the one told originally—and that happens to have been Mary Cochran's experience." In this letter, then, Anderson either fails to record or obscures three parts of the history of the composition of Mary Cochran , which will be documented here: 1) his work on the novel in 1913 after moving to Chicago; 2) his effort in 1916 and again in 1919 to rework the novel for publication; and 3) his use of portions of the typescript, sometimes even word-for-word, in two stories in The Triumph of the Egg . After Anderson brought the novel from Ohio to Chicago in early 1913, he probably continued working on it for the remainder of that year. First, some themes and settings in the novel closely parallel Anderson's life in 1913 Chicago; and second, some of Anderson's own comments in a 1916 newspaper interview give further credence to the theory of the 1913 progress on the novel. An examination of this interview, and of the autobiographical parallels in Mary Cochran , follows a brief summary of the novel. 3 In episodic form much like that of Winesburg, Ohio , Mary Cochran tells the story of the growth from adolescence to womanhood of its heroine, Mary Cochran. In most of Chapter 1 Mary's father, while informing his daughter of his impending death, describes his courtship to her mother and the couple's subsequent marital collapse in the small New England town where he and Mary now live alone. After her father dies, ending the novel's first episode, Mary leaves town to attend a small college in southern Ohio. Although the Newberry typescript is missing some pages that deal with the Ohio episode, the extant pages make it clear that she encounters several aggressive men during these four years. In one incident which is referred to, not presented, in the typescript (though it perhaps was detailed in the missing typescript pages), Mary is surprised by a sexual advance from her professor, Jacob Hillis. In a second incident she is approached by another friend, Emil Botts, who, after sharing a ritual feast with Mary in the woods, tries to consummate his several-year friendship with the girl. But Mary runs frantically from the deranged poet. The next six chapters take place several years after Mary's move from the Ohio college town to Chicago. She becomes friends with Duke Yetter, her employer, and with Sylvester Hunnicutt, a man who has rejected the crass life of business while simultaneously remaining a silent partner in Yetter's firm. Though she rejects Duke's marriage proposal Mary does agree to Sylvester's bold suggestion that she accompany him on a two-week tour of Illinois and Wisconsin. She views the adventure as her chance to make up for her many failures with men and finally to generate a complete relationship, both physically and emotionally; Sylvester, however, only wants Mary as a sounding board for his rhetorical flights about the need for "new women" and new male-female relationships in the modern world. When Mary finally penetrates Sylvester's rhetoric and the couple make love in a Wisconsin hotel room, the affair amounts to an awkward and unsatisfactory one for the girl. The final five chapters of the book begin when the two adventurers visit a Wisconsin poultry farm, the home of Sylvester's wife from whom he is separated. Sylvester has convinced himself that by confronting his wife with Mary and by explaining his need for independence, he will be able to persuade her to seek a friendly divorce. But the naive man only triggers the rage of a woman who has been praying for her husband's final return, and Sylvester and Mary flee from the farm. After this debacle Mary leaves Sylvester and decides to return to Chicago by herself, now believing that she must work out her own problems before she can expect success in her relationship with Sylvester. And with renewed zeal she earns promotions at her old firm by improving the company's quality control. Meanwhile Sylvester returns to Chicago to work on his novel describing the sort of women needed to rebuild America. And finally he and Mary, having independently found satisfaction in work, join in an unconventional marriage whereby each partner retains his or her independence and, in addition, his or her separate residence. Certain characters, settings, and themes in Mary Cochran have close counterparts in Anderson's own life after his move from Ohio to Chicago in 1913. In February of that year he arrived in the city, only recently having severed his business connections in Elyria, Ohio. He brought from Ohio a number of manuscripts which he now hoped to prepare for publication. But to support himself in Chicago he had to begin to write copy for the Taylor-Critchfield Advertising Company. He also found time during these first months to befriend members of the now famous Fifty-Seventh Street Colony of artists who occupied studio apartments across from Jackson Park on Stony Island Avenue and Fifty-Seventh Street (Sutton, Road , p. 285). This precise setting occurs in numerous Chicago scenes in Mary Cochran , and Mary herself lives in a room overlooking Jackson Park. Floyd Dell, a journalist in 1913, reigned in the Colony along with his wife, Margery Currey, a woman very much concerned with the development of alternate roles for women. Currey and Dell moved into separate, though adjacent, apartments on Stony Island Avenue and Fifty-Seventh Street in early 1913, resembling the arrangement between Mary and Sylvester at the end of the novel. And it was Margery Currey who helped draw the Colony's attention to the new writer in Chicago, Sherwood Anderson. Also brought into the Colony later were Anderson's estranged wife, Cornelia, and Tennessee Mitchell, who would become Anderson's second wife in 1916. In these late spring and early summer days of 1913, Anderson visited the Jackson Park apartments and sometimes read his work before the others in the group. He soon became good friends with Currey and Mitchell, both of whom resemble Mary Cochran in their concern for the independent working life of women. While writing part of the novel in mid-1913, Anderson may have been influenced by Dell's Women as World Builders , published earlier that year. In the introduction to these sketches of contemporary women activists, all previously published in the Friday Literary Review , Dell presents feminist doctrine very similar to that which is implicit, but occasionally explicit, in Mary Cochran . Like Anderson, he seems to exclude the revolution in sexual mores from the domain of feminism, considering such changes in "personal relations" a matter of "common sense" rather than a concern of feminism. 4 Dell also advocates the "setting of mothers free" with meaningful work, since the "woman who finds her work will find her love" (Dell, Women , pp. 9-10). Of the three major classes of women described by Dell—the mothers, who "find their destiny in the bearing and rearing of children"; the courtesans, who "make a career of charming, stimulating, and comforting men"; the workers, who "demand independent work like men" (Dell, Women , pp. 10-11)—only the latter are presented as a possible solution to female subjugation. Mary Cochran also demonstrates this preference for the worker-type of woman, and even includes Dell's distinction between the "worker" and the "courtesan." That is, when Mary finally decides to seek her salvation through work, she rejects once and for all the role of "courtesan" as proposed to her by Duke Yetter at the end of the novel. Besides stressing woman's independence through labor, both Dell's and Anderson's accounts of feminism avoid what Dell calls "the spirit of Romance. I mean that attitude toward woman which accepts her sex as a miraculous justification for her existence . . . in short, woman-worship. The reverence for woman as virgin, or wife, or mother, irrespective of her capacities as friend or leader or servant" (Dell, Women , p. 17). In rejecting this romantic view of women, Mary Cochran remarks to Sylvester Hunnicutt that virginity is "not worth while. It is a thing thrust upon us. Things are badly arranged. We are made to cling to virginity and girlhood when we want to push on into womanhood." Later she gropes for a more mature sexual relationship on her trip with Sylvester, but her attempt fails; it is only after she has achieved happiness in work that she seems to find some degree of satisfaction with Sylvester. In a final curious correspondence, both Dell and Anderson view feminism as a "phase of the great human renaissance inaugurated by men." In addition, the movement "deserves to be considered" only because it will help to free men from the boredom of "subservient women," thus helping to make of woman man's self-sufficient complement (Dell, Women , pp. 19—21). Indeed, the heroine's liberation into labor at the end of Mary Cochran does seem of only secondary importance to the corresponding breakthrough by Sylvester Hunnicutt into the realm of the imagination, into the world of novel-writing. Besides parallels between Mary Cochran and Anderson's own life in Chicago in 1913, two comments by Anderson himself support the theory that he worked on the novel during that year. Late in 1916 Anderson wrote his good friend, Waldo Frank, that, "I met Floyd Dell, the first man interested in writing that I had ever known, while I was at work on my third novel." 5 And in a newspaper interview published at about the same time as this letter was written, Anderson clearly refers to Mary Cochran as his third novel: "'My first novel is called Windy McPherson's Son . That'll be out Sept. 1. My second is called Marching Men , and my third Mary Cochran . Then there are some more I'll put out later.'" 6 If by "third" novel in his letter to Frank, Anderson meant to indicate Mary Cochran , as he did in the newspaper interview, and if he recalled while writing the Frank letter that he had "met Floyd Dell" in early 1913 in Chicago, then the author's own comments suggest that he worked on Mary Cochran in Chicago in 1913, after he had moved from Elyria, Ohio. Very likely, then, Anderson drafted part of the novel during the summer and fall of 1913 after he had become involved with Dell, Currey, and Mitchell in the Colony. Yet he also might have written part of the novel when he was further distanced from his associations of the late spring and summer, perhaps working on it during his December, 1913 to March, 1914 visit to the Ozarks. 7 Although there are no precise accounts of the amount or nature of the work that Anderson completed on this winter visit (Sutton, Road , p. 235), he might have enthusiastically continued a project like Mary Cochran during this relief from his advertising routine in Chicago. And as he and Cornelia endured the final dissolution of their marriage, he might have had little difficulty writing about Gertrude Bickford, the "home-staying" though independent wife of Sylvester, and about Sylvester himself, the businessman-turned-writer who severed his marriage with Gertrude to begin anew with Mary Cochran.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Anderson's work on the novel in Ohio and then in Chicago in 1913 does not complete the history of its composition. His letters indicate that he reworked parts of the novel, and predicated its eventual publication, at least twice before the end of the decade. For example, a 1916 letter to his good friend, Marietta Finley, shows him still considering some major revisions in the text. This letter also recalls the essential sexual ambiguity of Mary Cochran , the uncertainty whether Mary has achieved sexual satisfaction with Sylvester along with her marriage to him and her new-found success in the working world: Some time ago the true solution of "Mary Cochran" came to me. She could not of course have married Sylvester. That I think quite clear. In the new draft Mary will be left with the realization that she has done the big thing in accepting work as her way out. She might have had Sylvester, too, had she been able to realize beauty in herself. It may seem a terrible pronouncement that woman, although she accept work and make of herself a sturdy figure in the world, is yet unworthy of love if she be not physically beautiful and have not that daring fling at life that belongs to the artist but it is true. It seems a terrible pronouncement, I say, and yet try changing the words and make the same pronouncement about men. It works either way you see. Only I think women have not faced the fact as men have—they have not been compelled to face it. We have lied to them so much. Women really believe that they have it in them to love as a bee has it in her to gather honey. I don't believe Mary was a lover at all. She was a worker. 8 That the extant typescripts, in spite of this letter, retain Mary's marriage to Sylvester suggests four possibilities: that Anderson decided to make the revision but simply never wrote it in; that he made the revision in the novel but that any portions of text containing it were discarded or lost; that he considered, but later rejected, this change in the narrative; or that he perhaps transformed a more conventional marriage in an earlier manuscript into a less conventional one involving separate residences in the extant typescripts. In any case, the letter shows that Mary Cochran was still very much in Anderson's plans in late 1916. No references to this novel can be found in the Newberry outgoing letters for the following year, 1917—a year in which Anderson continued his Chicago friendships, sought publication of more stories and novels, and still wrote advertising copy for a living. But early in 1918 he writes Van Wyck Brooks that, "When I came to look at my novel Mary Cochran , written several years ago, it didn't suit me. I shall hold it back for more work" (Jones and Rideout, Letters , p. 31: ? early April, 1918). Not until over a year later, however, do Anderson's letters again record his interest in this project. To his publisher, Ben Huebsch, he reports in the late summer of 1919, "About the novel. When I got in to it I found I wanted to rewrite it almost entirely. It is a book I wrote several years ago and it seems to me it can be very greatly improved. I will keep at it and hope I will have it ready for you to look at shortly after the first of the year" (Newberry outgoing, 23 Aug. 1919). Apparently Anderson did keep at the rewriting, remarking to Huebsch in mid-November that, "One of these days I shall be able to give you the Mary Cochran book. It has tantilized me a good deal but is coming clear now. In its final form it will be like Winesburg, a group of tales woven about the life of one person but each tale will be longer and more closely related to the developement of the central caracter" (Newberry outgoing, 12 Nov. 1919). Of course, this intention to rework and finally to publish Mary Cochran conflicts with the 1922 letter to Hansen in which he states that he never returned to work on the novel after the apprentice writing period in Ohio. But in late 1919, satisfied with his recently published Winesburg , he felt that he had found his own prose form and perhaps thought that he could publish another collection of interrelated short stories on the heels of Winesburg, Ohio . There was no need, in 1919, to obscure the genesis of the novel for he did not yet consider the project a failure. Later in the winter of 1919 he repeats his desire for an integrated noveltale collection. To Waldo Frank he writes, "Out of my necessity I am throwing the Mary Cochran book into the Winesburg form, half individual tales, half long novel form. It enables me to go at each tale seperately, perhaps when I am ready to do it at one long sitting. My life now is too broken up for the long sustained thing. Every few days I must go wade in mud, in the filth of money making" (Newberry outgoing, ca. Dec. 1919). Three additional late 1919 letters also refer to his work on the book. He says to Paul Rosen-feld, his good friend, "I have gone back into my Mary Cochran book, written a long time ago and have been trying to work on it when I can" (Newberry outgoing, ca. winter, 1919). To Frank he writes, "Also I write the Mary Cochran stories," and in another letter to Frank that, "Still I work again. I am casting Mary Cochran into real form." But in the final 1919 letter to Waldo Frank, Anderson's frustration with the revision project begins to show: "The tales that are to make the Mary Cochran book are waiting like tired people on the doorstep of the house of my mind. They are unclothed. I need to be a tailor and make warm clothes of words for them" (Newberry outgoing, all three letters to Frank ca. Dec. 1919). Sick with influenza, dispirited by his advertising routine, and probably depressed by his standstill on Mary Cochran , Anderson left Chicago in January of 1920 for a working vacation in Mobile and then Fairhope, Alabama. Remaining there until late spring, he probably made one last effort to put the novel together. In an undated letter from Fairhope, though one probably written just a few days before his May departure, 9 he notes that he is "having great fun with my new book Many Marriages and poor Mary C is shoved away again" (Newberry Reserved, Fairhope 1920). If Anderson had been able to work on Mary Cochran during his stay in Alabama, now he was once again postponing its completion. But some convincing evidence suggests that he probably shelved the novel before this last month of his Alabama visit, deciding instead to fashion from it several independent short stories or perhaps a collection. In fact, before Anderson even left the South, the May, 1920 issue of the Dial was coming out with his "The Door of the Trap," a short story with Mary Cochran as its protagonist. In this story, one of Mary's college professors frightens her with an unexpected embrace while she is visiting his home for dinner. Though the names of the professor and the college town are different, the plot of the story resembles that of the missing portion of the Newberry typescript mentioned earlier in this essay, judging by scattered allusions to the incident in extant parts of the typescript. And it seems possible, therefore, that in 1920 Anderson may have removed pages from his aging typescript for use as starter copy for the story that came to be published in the Dial . Though the correspondence between "The Door of the Trap" and the Newberry typescript is speculative, that between the typescript and a second published story is less so. Over a year after the first story's appearance, Anderson published "Unlighted Lamps" in the July, 1921 issue of Smart Set , only a few months before the inclusion of both stories in the collection The Triumph of the Egg . Whereas "The Door of the Trap" may account for part of a missing chapter in the Newberry typescript, "Unlighted Lamps" closely parallels the extant first chapter of the novel typescript. A portion of this first chapter, in fact, is carried over verbatim into the published story. 10 The probable extraction of these two stories from Mary Cochran provides substantial evidence that Anderson had given up trying to form either a novel or a Winesburg -like collection from the typescript by 1921. Perhaps his decision to insert only a few Mary Cochran stories into an otherwise unrelated collection of stories came in December of 1920, when he wrote Huebsch that, "I've an idea I would like to publish another book of short stories and I have some good ones. I'll likely come down in January and we'll talk this over" (Newberry outgoing, 14 Dec. 1920). For by March he was able to write that "the new book is ready to close" (Newberry Reserved, Mar. 1921 to Finley), and that it would be entitled The Triumph of the Egg (Newberry outgoing, 21 Mar. 1921 to Huebsch). In April, however, Anderson seemed to favor a title change and wrote that, "The new book has gone to the publisher. I shall call it 'Unlighted Lamps'" (Newberry Reserved, April 1921 to Finley). Even at this late date he seemed reluctant to relegate Mary Cochran to death by extraction, and wanted to label an entire short story collection by one of its only two Mary Cochran stories. Only when Anderson left for Europe in June—on another of his great escapes from the business world—did he probably bid farewell to the now ten to twelve-year-old novel. For after the publication later that summer of "Unlighted Lamps" and "The Door of the Trap" in the fifteen-story collection which came to be titled, after all, The Triumph of the Egg , no Anderson publication in the author's lifetime ever again included any portion of the Mary Cochran story. This novel, begun in the Ohio apprentice-writing years, crafted in 1913 under the influence of Dell and the Colony, reworked partially in 1916 and 1919, and then dismantled in part in the early twenties prior to the publication of Triumph , would add to the long list of Sherwood Anderson's unpublished novels. But because he never destroyed the novel, as he had claimed to in his 1922 letter to Harry Hansen, Anderson left at least partly unanswered his final disposition toward the work.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Second Thoughts on "Graham Greene's Second Thoughts": The Five Texts of The Heart of the Matter by Philip Stratford</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have in my possession an interesting piece of Greenealia, a privately printed pamphlet, The Virtue of Disloyalty , which draws its title from an address Greene read on receiving the Shakespeare Prize from the University of Hamburg in 1969. The dedication reads, in part, "from that old trickster Graham Greene who has just snatched the first edition from Viking." This refers to the fact that although he had agreed to let Viking Press use the address, hitherto only published in the prize ceremony programme, as the closing selection to The Portable Graham Greene which I was editing, he had subsequently decided to scoop the American publisher with his own first edition, printed in 300 copies by The Bodley Head and sent to friends at Christmas 1972, a few months before The Portable came out. The pamphlet is a good example of Greene's habitual, often elaborate prankishness. It is also a minor illustration of his practising what he preached—the virtue of disloyalty. He had just terminated a contract of over thirty years with Viking (ostensibly on the grounds that he disliked the garish covers they were putting on the paperback edition of his books). Whereas granting permission to publish a Portable was a parting concession to mark the long relationship, his snatching the first edition of the last selection was a parting shot. The reason I refer to the pamphlet, however, is other. Near the end of page 7 in my copy is a correction in ink (the printer had put "role" instead of "roll"—as in "the roll of honour" of disloyal writers). An asterisk sends the reader to the bottom margin where he can make out, in Greene's spidery, quasi-illegible hand, "No elegantly printed book escapes its misprint!" In the 1977 Studies in Bibliography David Leon Higdon undertakes to examine many of the inescapable misprints and voluntary changes between the first and last editions of The Heart of the Matter and proposes to show the author "clarifying intention, satisfying his own sense of craftsmanship and remaking his fictive reader." 1 Unfortunately, Professor Higdon has not been sensitive enough to the almost organic possibilities of alteration and error as a book lives on from one edition to the next, on one side of the Atlantic or the other. He takes as his early source, describing it as "similar" to the first edition (London, 1948), the Viking Compass edition of 1960, and as his late text the Viking Compass edition of 1974 which, he says, "is apparently identical" to the Collected Edition (London, 1971) (p. 250). In fact, both Compass editions differ considerably from their British counterparts which Greene used when making revisions. The 1960 Compass is identical to the American first edition, but not the British; the 1974 Compass was set from the Portable text which is similar but not identical to the Collected Edition. Professor Higdon makes no mention of another alternate, the Uniform Edition, which is unlike the rest. In brief, the story of these various editions is as follows. The British first edition appeared in May 1948; the American, with numerous changes of which Greene was unaware, in July the same year. While it is true that Greene revised his novel extensively for the Collected Edition in 1971, he had already begun to make revisions for the Uniform Edition in 1951. Finally, even the Collected Edition had its fair share of errors, many of which were caught and corrected, with Greene's approval, on the publication of the Viking Portable Graham Greene in 1973. One can see what dangers lie in the path of the bibliographer who does not take all five editions into account: he may mistake changes made in 1971 for ones made twenty years earlier; he may congratulate or berate Greene for decisions made, in fact, by some anonymous New York copy-editor in 1948; he may rely on the text of the Collected Edition as definitive when, to date at least, that of The Portable is the best available. I cannot delineate all variants but will choose a few examples from each category as illustrations. In seven cases Professor Higdon ascribes changes made in the Uniform Edition to the 1971 revision. The changes in themselves are not so important. It makes little difference, except for accuracy, to know that the Portugese captain's drawer contained "a little bundle of dirty photographs" (46) in the original text and a bundle of "dirty handkerchiefs" (51) by the 1951 Uniform Edition, or that Wilson said of Louise Scobie not "She's wonderful," (61) but "She's too good for him" (71) in the earlier of the two revisions and not in 1971 as Professor Higdon implies. What is important to note is that Greene's second thoughts about this novel were beginning to jell long before he undertook the major rewrite. Much more titillating and inexplicable are the changes made between the British and American first editions. There are thirteen of these in the article, all treated as though due to Greene's pen rather than to editorial intervention at The Viking Press. So, for example, Greene's original statement that a post-mortem in West Africa "was difficult" (291) becomes "impracticable" (301) in the American edition; "gin and bitters" (56) becomes "pink gin" (58); "clucking" (36) becomes "chuckling" (38); "hulk" (53) turns to "bulk" (54); "bare" (214) to "skinned" (218); "All Souls' Night" (256) to "Allhallows Eve" (264) and so on. A lot of interesting work might be done on this transatlantic tampering. Scarcely a single Greene novel escapes it. In the first 50 pages of A Gun for Sale , for instance, (American title This Gun for Hire ) there are 35 changes. Many of these are crass substitutions: "bitterly" (4) for "primly" (2) 2 ; "thinking" (17) for "dreaming" (22); ""Kensington" (32) for "Kennington" (44); "fellow" (38) for "bastard" (54). The rest are omissions, inversions, and inaccurate changes to grammar and syntax far beyond what is required to make British usage understandable in the U.S.A. The American text of The Third Man is an even more flagrant example. Here, besides countless annoying unmotivated alterations of the type noted above, a political factor seems to be in play. All unkind references to the Russians are eliminated from the American text, a strange phenomenon in the Cold War era, one would think, until one realizes that this diplomatic pussyfooting is bartered against the removal of many of Greene's more acid references to Americans. Close research will reveal like alterations in nearly all Viking editions of Greene's novels. In a footnote (p. 256), Professor Higdon refers to many changes in 'accidentals' that "result from Viking house-styling," but fails to say more. The changes I refer to, however, are much more than accidental and could hardly be excused under even the very broadest interpretation of "house-styling." Here in fact is a much more credible reason for Greene terminating his association with Viking than salacious cover illustrations. The last category—changes made to The Heart of the Matter after its appearance in the Collected Edition—is not dealt with in Professor Higdon's article, for he does not distinguish between the 1971 British edition and the better Portable text. In proof-reading the Collected version of the novel for inclusion as the cornerstone selection of The Portable , another anonymous Viking copy-editor, a sharp-eyed and objective one in 1972, made up for the indiscretions committed by his colleague in 1948. He discovered eight blemishes in the Collected Edition and suggested revisions which in correspondence Greene acknowledged as "quite correct." 3 These included errors which had persisted through all British editions: "hordes" (CE 71) was changed to "hoards" (VP 162); "holiday" (176) to "holy day" (249); and a misquotation from Helen Rolt's letter to Scobie was corrected. "My darling," (229) the letter opened the first time Scobie read it in the British text, and "My dear," he read when "his eye went back to the letter." (231) (Ironically, the first American edition got all these three right.) There were also errors that had been committed in the 1971 version only: an "I" omitted in the preface (xiv); "mosquisto" (140) and "post-morten" mis-spelled, and an odd late decision on Greene's part, for this edition only, to change the spelling of the malaria drug "atabrine" to "atebrin." The eighth discovery was an oversight of major proportion. In Scobie's letter to Helen he had said, in all editions before 1971, that he loved her "more than God," and he had recalled this statement twice, later in the novel. Greene intended, as Professor Higdon notes, to tone down Scobie's declaration of love by deleting all three references from the Collected Edition. In fact, he neglected to delete the third, which necessitated a four-line excision (277) and drew from Greene the admission that he had been "very careless" 4 in missing this discrepancy. So the elegantly printed Collected Edition also fails "to escape its misprints" and the sempiternal search for the pure text goes on. In Greene's brief pamphlet, The Virtue of Disloyalty , there was a second, undetected error. "If only writers could maintain that one virtue of disloyalty—for them more important than charity—unspotted from the world," the text read on page 10. Knowing that in Why Do I Write? (1948) a similar phrase had run "so much more important than purity," I wrote to ask Greene if he had really intended "charity" or if someone had experienced difficulty with his handwriting. "You are quite right," he replied. "'Charity' should read 'chastity.'" 5 The ubiquitous misprint again! But in matters of bibliography chastity must be mitigated with charity. I would myself like to claim that the text of The Portable is "pure," but Professor Higdon's probing has turned up two errors which escaped me. The first is a reference to Tallit's grandmother's lips as "his lips" (161), an error which stands in all but the first American edition; the second, the omission of an apostrophe in "Its" (156) in The Portable alone. And God knows there may be more.</field>
