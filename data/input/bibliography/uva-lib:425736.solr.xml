      <field name="heading_text">The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia: The First Fifty Years by DAVID L. VANDER MEULEN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The special association of the University of Virginia with books is a connection that began with the founding of the school. The establishment of the University itself was one of the three accomplishments for which the institution's material and intellectual architect, Thomas Jefferson, sought to be remembered in the epitaph on his tombstone; the physical and symbolic center of the "academical village" that he fashioned was the Rotunda; and the most important space in that most significant building was its Dome Room, designed to house the library. Despite the local propensity to invoke Jefferson at every opportunity, no one has yet contended that he was instrumental in creating the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. It has been the Society, however, that more powerfully than any other instrument has linked books with Mr. Jefferson's University in the public mind. That the opening two articles in the first volume of the Society's Papers --to be known from the second volume as Studies in Bibliography -- dealt with Jefferson reflects the Society's origins but is ultimately incidental to the larger connection. That the name of the University became a codeword for the analysis of books as physical objects, the study of the transmission of texts, and the preparation of scholarly editions, however, arose chiefly from the constellation of activities that the Society instigated. In his "warm welcome" to the Society and its journal in the January 1950 Modern Language Review , W. W. Greg noted this distinctiveness immediately: "Certainly the University of Virginia is the centre of a very live and extended school of Bibliography in all its aspects, not least in these highly technical ones that a small band of American scholars have made peculiarly their own." Ten years later a former University of Virginia professor then at the Claremont Graduate School, Sears Jayne, could attest in a letter to the Society's founders that "Since returning to California I have had many reminders of the fact that the name of the University of Virginia is known around the world primarily through the influence of its Bibliographical Society." But while the international renown and influence of the Society are easy to verify, the reasons for its growth are not. How is it that a diverse group of people connected with a small university in the American South created an organization that would symbolize a scholarly approach and would produce a journal, Studies in Bibliography , that from the start the Times Literary Supplement declared (on 23 March 1951) "must take its place in the first rank of such publications anywhere in the world"?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I An exploratory meeting for what was to become the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia was held at 4:30 Friday afternoon, 11 October 1946, in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division of the University Library. According to Linton Massey, who was to serve as the group's president for twenty-six years, in the 1920s such a society had been a gleam in the collective eyes of Randolph Church, who later became the State Librarian of Virginia; of Jack Dalton, then a student but who would rise to the post of University Librarian; and of John Cook Wyllie, who began working in the library as a student assistant during the 1928 Christmas holidays and later became Curator of Rare Books, University Librarian, and Director of University Libraries. The fulfillment of a dream of adequate space in the form of the completion of Alderman Library in 1938 reinvigorated thinking about books, as did the magnificent gift announced at the dedication of that building, the collection of the Detroit philanthropist Tracy W. McGregor. The McGregor books themselves were crucial in forming the perception of the University Library as a site for serious research; but with the collection also came funds for a magnificent room, one begging to be used for scholarly functions. The meeting in 1946 was at the instigation of Dr. Chalmers Gemmill, a University of Virginia (UVa) pharmacologist. Its venue, on the second floor of Alderman, identified it as in the demesne of Rare Book Curator Wyllie, who in preparation had sent in mid September an invitation and questionnaire to a couple hundred librarians, newspaper editors, printers, collectors, book dealers, and faculty, chiefly in Virginia. The intent was that responses to the questionnaire would help shape the organization, but the letter had to provide at least a tentative indication of its nature. Accordingly, Wyllie began: "At the suggestion of several local bibliophiles I am undertaking the organization of a small group of Charlottesville residents with an object of exhibiting in the Rare Book and Manuscript Division of the University of Virginia Library selections from their private libraries." He announced that at the planning meeting Gemmill would display and discuss examples of his own collection of Baskerville editions, implying thereby how such a group might proceed. The questionnaire asked whether respondents were interested in affiliating as active members with either a Bibliographical Society of Virginia or, more specifically, a Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. Subsequent questions inquired about dues, publications, exhibits, meetings, and officers, and they solicited names of people who might work on a constitution or be otherwise interested in joining. Wyllie's quietly shaping hand also appeared in notes that he attached to some letters. To a local bookstore proprietor, C. C. Wells, he wrote, for instance: "Would be particularly grateful if you could find time to write me off the names of some Charlottesville non- faculty collectors." About 110 of the surveys were returned. One interesting characteristic is the number of respondents who were not interested in such a group but who instead of discarding the letter explained why they could not participate (they were usually "too old" or "too busy"). Such considerateness may arise from the manners of an earlier generation, but it might also point to an element that seems to account for the wide acceptance of the proposal--that these were people who were part of John Wyllie's great orb of personal acquaintances. Whether the correspondents accepted or declined the invitation, their comments tended to reveal their sense of what Wyllie and the others were trying to create. A newspaper editor and stamp-collector from Lynchburg excused himself by saying, "If I were a collector of books, I am sure I would be glad to join an organization of men and women interested in the same hobby." A law professor carefully explained, "I love books for their contents, and old books for their association as well as their contents. That is, it is easy to feel about old books as if they were persons who reflect the mellowness of their years. I have no interest in books simply because of their rarity, such as first editions of current works. Accordingly, I do not believe that I would be a suitable member of the Bibliophile Society." Those who were interested displayed different degrees of enthusiasm. The head of a Charlottesville dame school wrote, "I will be there on Oct. 11--to see what this is all about." (Her name subsequently appeared on the list of charter members.) A printing company official thought such a society "might be helpful in establishing a company library of carefully selected volumes." The response of a University alumnus in New York must have warmed the heart of Wyllie, who had established the rare book holdings by examining every volume in the general stacks. This prospective member wrote that many people would like to make or encourage gifts to the library. "If such is the function of the organization you propose," he said, "I will do every thing in my power to be of help to you." Wyllie sometimes wrote back to overcome initial timidity. To UVa graduate Charlton Hinman, in Washington, D.C., he responded: "Your idea about the nature of an active member is clearly different from mine. It seems to me, for example, that a Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia without you and Billy Miller [that is, C. William Miller, another graduate] as members would be a pretty sorry society." Other letters offered seasoned advice. From the Folger Library, James McManaway, himself a member of the Virginia class of 1919, wrote Wyllie, "If a group of bibliophiles can be organized, their interests will be stimulated by an attractive news letter to announce programs, memorialize gifts to U.Va. and otherwise minister to their self esteem. Its contents should be urbane, rather than learned." Louis B. Wright of the Huntington Library encouraged Wyllie "not to have too many meetings each year. . . . In the intervals between formal meetings you might find it desirable to put on special exhibitions sponsored by the bibliographical society and send out leaflets describing them"--a system that had successfully created interest at the Huntington. The most extensive comments came in an enthusiastic and wise letter from Williamsburg. "I was a member of the Bibliographical Society of America as early as 1901," it said, "when it was the Bibli. Socy. of Chicago, and when I was librarian of old Armour Institute. I attended the meetings, about eight or ten [people] present, and I must say they were insufferably dull." The correspondent pointed out other potential dangers: "The leaders [of the Bibliographical Society of America] have generally been busy men in their professions, and have not had the time to extend the Society's work. Moreover, in recent years, it has gotten into the hands of a small group, and remains in that group." A new society, however, could add to the forces creating bibliographical understanding: "It is a matter of regret that the term `bibliography' is so misunderstood, and especially among librarians, the view being that it is enumerative only, making . . . lists from Readers Guide, and such stuff." The results of the questionnaire were presented at the October 1946 meeting, at which the group not only heard Gemmill's paper on "John Baskerville, Typefounder" but also designated a six-member committee to draft a constitution. Wyllie was appointed chair; the group also included Miss Lucy T. Clark, a rare-book cataloguer; Fredson Bowers, a forty-one-year-old Assistant Professor of English; Charles D. McCormick, a local resident who earlier had been part of a book-collecting group in Cleveland; Charles W. Smith from the Art Department; and Hugh M. Spencer, a chemistry professor. On 20 February 1947, John Wyllie sent out a letter announcing that an organizational meeting would be held the following Wednesday evening, February 26, in the McGregor Room. The thirty-three people who gathered there adopted a constitution that defined the object of their new society to be "to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography." The group was to be called "The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia." This was the name widely preferred on the questionnaires, not only by Charlottesville respondents but also by a surprising number of others. Some had recommended the more localized term out of caution: if the Society succeeded on a small scale, its scope could be extended. Others recognized that the leadership would arise from within the University, and they therefore found the longer title more accurate. Linton Massey later reported the thinking that predominated: "From the beginning it was decided to identify the Society with the University of Virginia, no matter how dubiously the mother might regard her upstart offspring, because such an association would parallel the English precedent at Oxford, as it did the one at Cambridge later on; and because [paradoxically] such an affiliation would broaden the appeal and widen its scope far beyond that of a mere regional organization." The cumbersomeness of multiple prepositions in the name raised objections from some reviewers of the Society's Papers , but the designation--as well as the association with the University--has endured. That first official meeting also codified practice in other, albeit less formal, ways. The McGregor Room was to be the standard venue for Society meetings, most of which, like this one, included a talk. At the inaugural session the address was given by Fredson Bowers, whose name would be linked more prominently than anyone else's with the Society. Speaking on "Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors," he drew on information provided him by Jacob Blanck to prepare a "Description of the six impressions of Washington Irving's `Wolfert's Roost.'" This six-page mimeograph, whose contents would appear as a sample in Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description two years later, was distributed at the talk and also circulated with the first number of the Society's Secretary's News Sheet the next month. Though Bowers himself was to address the Society formally a number of times in succeeding decades, his contributions represented only one kind of presentation made at its meetings. On the other hand, although the summary of his talk in the first News Sheet indicates that the evening was less daunting than might first appear, his discussion gave notice that the concerns of the fledgling Society would extend beyond dilettantism. The roster of original officers and Council members of the Society reveals the range of interests that found a welcome here. Chalmers Gemmill, who had illustrated his talk with his own books, was elected the group's first president. His involvement appears to have arisen from his collecting interests; besides the Baskervilles, he owned a library of Nonesuch Press books, which were exhibited at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg in 1970. Gemmill, who was Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, was also a medical historian. His collecting and historical interests came together in an article he published as from a "Correspondent" in the London Times on 12 May 1965, "Coin-buying in the Middle East." He had long been in pursuit of the ancient wonder drug silphium produced from a plant pictured on old coins but now believed extinct. Of the first four Councilors, Hugh M. Spencer from the Chemistry Department also had a historical bent, and in 1983 he was to publish a history of that department, just as Gemmill had done for Pharmacology in 1966. According to Spencer's wife he was an eclectic collector, and his books were, she says, "a great source of pleasure to him." Miss Lucy T. Clark was the rare book cataloguer of the University, one whose tenure went back to the Rotunda days of the Library and who had trained herself in her vocation when she was unable to obtain suitable Library of Congress cards for old books. She eventually was the chief cataloguer of C. Waller Barrett's collection of American literature that he donated to the University Library, and she published a number of checklists based on portions of that hoard. The third Councilor, Charles W. Smith, was the first chairman of the University's Art Department and an artist known especially for his work in book design and wood-block printing and painting. Many of his cuts of local scenes even now grace University publications. In the 1960s he was a chief part of the Society sub-group called the "Typogs" that set up its own printing establishment, the Cockescraw Press, in the basement of Cocke Hall at the end of the University Lawn. The remaining three original officers--Linton R. Massey, Councilor; Fredson T. Bowers, Vice-President; and John Cook Wyllie, Secretary-Treasurer--were to play the most fundamental and the longest- lasting roles in the Society. But before considering these founders in greater detail, it is helpful to identify the other Councilors of the first decade; they too helped to shape the Society at a crucial time, and their varied interests reflect the attraction the Society held. Atcheson Hench, who served as President in 1950, was a UVa professor of early English literature. A modest man whose motto was "If Hench can do it, anybody can do it," he was an omnivorous collector--of books, of manuscripts, but especially of words. By recording the language of his colleagues, his townsfolk, and his newspapers he ended up contributing to seven major dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary and the Dictionary of American Regional English ; his work accounts for the 195 quotations in the OED from the Charlottesville Daily Progress and another fifteen from the local student paper The Cavalier Daily . Willis H. Shell, Jr., of Richmond privately operated "The Attic Press" (in his attic), but as a representative for the William Byrd Press he designed the early volumes of Studies in Bibliography and arranged their publication at virtual cost. Mrs. Vincent (Eleanor) Shea, who tended to many of the Society's local arrangements, was a collector of garden books, someone very interested in crafts such as printing, and a consultant in prints to the University Library. Joseph M. Carrière, Vice-President in 1951, taught French at the University, was twice president of the American Folklore Society, had been cited by H. L. Mencken (along with Hench) for his work on the sources of the American language, and had been named a Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor. Mrs. Randolph Catlin collected books of the Derrydale Press and editions of Somervile's poem "The Chace," both of which collections she eventually gave to the University Library. Arthur F. Stocker, Professor of Classics and sometime head of the Society's Publications Committee, was drawn to the Society because of the interest he shared in textual study with Fredson Bowers. Jack Dalton was University Librarian; he left in 1956 to become director of the American Library Association's new office for overseas library development and eventually became head of the library school at Columbia. Philip Williams was a former dissertation student of Fredson Bowers who returned to teach English at the University. William B. O'Neal was a professor of Architecture and a book and print collector. Finally, Sears Jayne was an English Department professor with a special interest in library catalogs of the English Renaissance. On the tenth anniversary of the Society, Linton Massey characterized the Councils of the first decade this way: "So far from being a small group of intellectuals lost in a bookish world, they were then and are now, mere bibliophiles reasonably expert in some specialized field, qualified to hold office at least in the broad sense that they are able to read and write and are willing to meet twice yearly in an atmosphere of modest and genteel worldliness"--that is, convening at the Masseys' estate Kinloch, east of Charlottesville in Keswick, and after the Council session enjoying an elegant dinner and the notable fruits of Massey's cellar. Each Council member seems indeed to have made important contributions to the Society, but it was the efforts of Massey, Wyllie, and Bowers that were utterly essential and profoundly formative. All remained active in the Society until their deaths (Wyllie on 18 April 1968 at age 59, Massey on 9 November 1974 at 74 years, and Bowers on 11 April 1991 at 85), making their passings of particular importance in the Society's life. Linton Massey served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to his death twenty-three years later. His vocation was supervising a large farming operation on the 500-acre Kinloch estate and landscaping eleven beautiful gardens there. His avocation, or perhaps his other vocation, was book collecting. Interested in twentieth-century fiction, he early came to appreciate William Faulkner and began forming what Fredson Bowers described, in a breathless sentence for a breathtaking collection, as "the prototype of all single- author collections for depth and variety of original works, manuscripts, letters, clippings, memorabilia, and works of criticism and reference, so rich and varied that the Special Collections of the Alderman Library have had to invent a wholly new system of classification to do justice to this extraordinary collection." When Faulkner moved to Charlottesville he and Massey became fast friends, and Massey was instrumental in persuading Faulkner to bring his own manuscripts and working papers to the University Library, where they now reside with Massey's complementary collection. The friendship also led to the formation of the Faulkner Foundation, of which Massey was the first president (and Wyllie Vice-President). The Foundation supervised the Faulkner manuscripts, concerned itself with the education of black college students in Mississippi, awarded plaques to American writers of special achievement, and sponsored the translation and publication in English of Latin American novels. On his death Massey was honored by being one of the few non- academics to have a memorial resolution (prepared by Bowers) read before the University faculty. The eloquence and urbanity of Massey's letters preserved in Society files come as little surprise when one realizes that already in the 1920s H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan had accepted one of his short stories (published January 1924) for the Smart Set . What is striking about his correspondence is the impression it gives of his daily attention to the affairs of the Society and the application of his clear-headed business sense to its organization and publications program--all this while maintaining esteem for the value of bibliographical scholarship. His alertness to activities in all corners of the bibliographical world is pleasantly symbolized by the fact that he and Wyllie were the first American members of the Bibliographical Society of Glasgow when it was revived in 1960. What is even more striking, however, is the passion with which he insisted that his gifts to the Society in support of its work be anonymous. Over the years those gifts amounted to tens of thousands of dollars, starting at a time when postage for announcements of the Society's meetings cost one twentieth of what it does now. It was Massey's quiet contributions that tipped the scales into solvency in the early years, that financed awards to student book-collectors, that helped republish copies of Studies that had gone out of print, and that sponsored receptions in the Society's name when groups such as the Grolier Club visited Charlottesville. The other members of the de facto triumvirate recognized Massey's contributions in all their forms, and they were grateful. After a Council meeting in 1955, Bowers wrote Massey (on 5 October) an appreciative note, praising not only your financial generosity, but your personal. For high among the important contributions to the Society's success I place unreservedly the time and thought you have placed in it and the directed energy you have instilled in it. We should not be what we are today, or will be in the future, without your steady hand at the helm, and I for one am profoundly grateful to you for the most valuable contribution of all that you have made to our work, and that is yourself. Wyllie shared those sentiments. When in 1952 he received the University's Raven Award, he wrote Massey (on 15 May 1952): One of the things that loomed large in this citation was the bringing here of the national society, namely BSA [the Bibliographical Society of America], largely of course your doing. But the outstanding reason noted, and given especial prominence by the undergraduate group, was the inauguration and continuation of the student book collectors' contest, for which as a man of candor I must give you the entire credit. Your anonymity in these collector awards has in short protected you from the credit you deserve, but they have also brought me an award which properly belongs to one who is otherwise ineligible for it even if you weren't too modest to take it. Massey's response is interesting, both as an example of his own eloquence and for insight into how he viewed his position. He wrote: For myself I am perfectly aware that no public recognition can come to me from any society or organization at the University because of my academic impurity. My motives therefore acquire a metaphysical unreality, resembling the pure act as defined by Gide--a gratuitous deed without compulsion, design, or hope of reward. With this I am content, together with the good-will, confidence and even respect that you so willingly give an unabashed amateur. Again I congratulate you, wholly and warmheartedly, because I know as few others can know, how accurate the citation really was. The respect in which Linton Massey held John Cook Wyllie was widely shared. Even three decades after Wyllie's early death, his name spurs passionate assertions of affection from those who knew him. He, like Massey, held only a bachelor's degree (though he took all the graduate English courses the University had to offer), but he rose through the ranks locally and also became an important figure in the national and international book worlds. Like Massey, he sought heroically to serve other people and causes rather than to advance his own name, and as a consequence that name is not as widely known as it deserves to be. Wyllie's career was devoted to libraries, editorial projects, and what one friend has called "academic entrepreneurship." His association with the University Library that began as a student assistant in the 1920s continued unbroken until his death--except for the hiatus in World War II when he served in the North Africa and China-Burma campaigns and received decorations from three governments. In 1948 the University president called on him to reorganize the University Press, an assignment made in recognition of his extensive orchestration of printed works bearing the imprint of the University and one that foreshadowed his central role in developing publications of the Bibliographical Society--in both situations, usually without a mark to identify his contribution. The citation for the University's Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award that he received in 1948 captured his character: . . . by his keen mind, indefatigable industry, and striking originality he has extended widely a wholesome influence for intellectual honesty and sturdy endeavor. The full story of his generous and self-sacrificing efforts is known to no one else, and has been forgotten by him. Some of his great energy found expression in historical and bibliographical scholarship. The rare book stacks he maintained were populated, according to a biographical account by Matthew Bruccoli, "with what lesser curators described as duplicate copies." He was familiar with all aspects of bookmaking and of bibliographical methodology and apparatus: during the summer of 1937 he did apprentice work under master bookbinders at the University of Michigan and the New York Public Library; in the 1960s he experimented with beta-radiographs of watermarks in the papers of Thomas Jefferson, assisted by local nuclear physicist Reed Johnson, who had earlier done the technical work for Allan Stevenson's experiments with watermarks in Chicago; he devised a system for relaying pages of books to other University libraries by television; and he was responsible for bringing to the library one of the first six--perhaps one of the first two--Hinman Collators ever made, a device that served to entertain visiting bibliophiles and that also facilitated the work of Fredson Bowers and his graduate students in comparing texts. Wyllie himself was long interested in the typography of the Bay Psalm Book, a subject of his Rosenbach lectures in March 1960. His early theory was that this volume known as the first book printed in the American colonies might actually have been printed in England. When the Princeton historian Julian Boyd caught wind of the suggestion (through a letter that Frederick Goff at the Library of Congress had mistakenly mailed to Boyd instead of to Wyllie), he had proposed that Wyllie spill the beans at the forthcoming meeting, in 1952, of the Bibliographical Society of America in Charlottesville. Wrote Boyd, "What a reception for the New Englanders that would be!" As Secretary-Treasurer of the Bibliographical Society for the first fifteen years and as Treasurer after that, Wyllie was the most common point of contact between the Society and the world. His work was crucial in the most visible activities of the Society: preparing its newsletter, the Secretary's News Sheet , from March 1947 on; coordinating its publications; and arranging speakers for its meetings, a task made easier by his active participation in the major bibliographical organizations of the country. Wyllie's popularity and his notable service made his early death in 1968 all the more stunning. In the preface to tributes collected in the 27 April 1968 issue of AB Bookman's Weekly , Sol Malkin wrote of the difficulty of reconciling himself to the fact that Wyllie was gone. Waller Barrett spoke of Wyllie's indispensable help in forming his collection of American literature, but above all for his revivifying assistance and encouragement. Howard Mott wrote Massey that the "loyal friendship, help and encouragement of John Wyllie" were crucial factors in his decision to stay in the book business. James J. Kilpatrick recalled that in the ten years John Wyllie was--amid his other duties--Book Editor of the Richmond News Leader , "We were then running the best damned book page in the entire country, the New York Times not excepted. God, how we miss him." The third of the powerhouses that propelled the Bibliographical Society from the start was Fredson Bowers. A full account of his life and work has been furnished by G. Thomas Tanselle and published by the Society in 1993, a chronicle that Michael Dirda of the Washington Post Book World has called "a model `academic' biography." Bowers is indeed the best-known person associated with the Society, not because of immodesty on his part (he too applied himself behind the scenes to all aspects of the Society's activities) but because he published widely and because his name necessarily accompanied the journal he edited for the Society, Studies in Bibliography (popularly known as Studies or SB ). Bowers had completed his doctoral work at Harvard in 1934, chiefly under the person he referred to as "my master Kittredge." He stayed there to teach until 1936, when he moved to Princeton for two years and then on to Virginia, where as a scholar and eventually as chairman of the English Department and Dean of the Faculty he would play crucial roles in the institution's rise to prominence. His reasons for leaving Princeton are not clear, though scuttlebutt holds that his colleagues were tired of him placing his offprints in their boxes. In 1937, for instance, he published ten notes and articles, ranging from pieces for more popular consumption in the Times Literary Supplement and the Sunday New York Times to a lengthy essay in Studies in Philology and two more in JEGP . As Tanselle documents, in 1936 Bowers also published his first bibliographical piece. Why Bowers came to Virginia is only slightly more apparent than why he left Princeton. The explanation of one of Bowers's early students, Irby Cauthen, is simple: "Because of Dean Wilson." It seems that Dean James Southall Wilson had in mind that Bowers would take over, as he did, the courses of John Calvin Metcalf, who was about to retire. Metcalf, according to Cauthen, had recognized Bowers's abilities at once, and Bowers also seems to have liked Wilson immediately. As signs of that friendship, Bowers edited a festschrift for him in 1951, dedicated his edition of Leaves of Grass to him in 1955, and prepared the official memorial resolution when Wilson died in 1963. At that time he wrote Wilson's widow, "I have always loved and revered him. He was the cause of my coming to the University, and he was an important reason why I stayed, perhaps the most important reason. I have always said that he was one of the three or four authentically great men whom I have known in my lifetime." Colleagues who were present at the 1969 dedication of Wilson Hall, a new building to house the English Department, say that it was the only time they ever saw Bowers weep. Bowers joined the UVa English faculty in 1938 and within a couple years had established courses in the study of books as physical objects and in textual criticism. His work too was interrupted by wartime service, in this case in Washington, D.C., as supervisor of an intelligence unit deciphering enemy codes. His group was, in the words of William H. Bond, a "dismayingly bright bunch." Among its members were a number of people now well known to the bibliographical world: Bond himself, Giles Dawson, the classicist Richard Lattimore, and Bowers's former student Charlton Hinman, who in the course of his work conceived the idea of his collating machine. Bowers meanwhile had been designated one of bibliography's promising stars in F. C. Francis's account of the first fifty years of England's Bibliographical Society, published in 1945. Like Wyllie, he returned to the University ready for business--which included, as it turned out, the establishment of a society and journal that would occupy him for almost another half century. The successful establishment of the Bibliographical Society, then, was first of all the result of the collocation of these specially gifted individuals in Charlottesville. But another sine qua non was the backing that local residents provided. Although the Society's publications, especially Studies in Bibliography , would quickly propel it to international attention, not all of the Society's organizers envisioned (and those who did could not safely assume) a world-wide constituency. What was crucial to the undertaking was a core of supporters who could assist in whatever projects the Society might undertake and, through their annual dues, provide a regular source of income for those activities. The Society that came into being that winter evening early in 1947 listed 130 charter members--most of them from Charlottesville, and nearly all the rest from Virginia as well. Charlottesville and the surrounding Albemarle County then had a combined population of only 50,000, and the University was a quarter of its present size. The testimony of people who recall that era is that the dynamics of a small community prompted people to follow with attentiveness- -and with their presence--the ventures of their acquaintances. The early life of the Society quite naturally reflected the interests of those who had chosen to associate in this way, but it also established the patterns of activity that have been followed to some degree or other ever since.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The easiest way for the Society to establish a corporate identity and also to serve the core community most directly was to hold public meetings, and over the next twenty years the group sponsored about 120 of them. The University and city newspapers invited local residents, while Society members received notice on one-cent postcards labeled by Addressograph plates. Most meetings featured a distinguished guest who gave an evening talk in front of the McGregor Room fireplace. Gemmill's discussion of Baskerville in October 1946 foreshadowed the pattern that developed once the Society was formally constituted in February 1947. Besides Bowers's presentation at that meeting, two other speakers appeared before the Society that spring: charter members Charles D. Hurt from the Stone Printing Co., Roanoke, speaking about "The Monotype" (18 April), and Charlton Hinman from Johns Hopkins on "Why 79 First Folios?" (6 June). When the Society reassembled for the next academic year, its roster of programs had attained the shape it was to hold for about two decades. A list of the talks given the first two full seasons shows something of the nature and range of the presentations. Providing these speakers was a significant contribution to the life of the University and town; the guests meanwhile gained an opportunity to encounter a pleasant part of the physical and intellectual world, and the Society benefited from the increased sense of its existence on the part of its visitors. 1947-48 Oct. 8 Kenneth S.

The Society's breadth of contacts and its increasing recognition enabled it to lure speakers without duplication, though a number of them could be found close to home. As a talented crop of Fredson Bowers's graduate students came to maturity they joined the procession: Philip Williams and Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., in 1952, George Williams in 1955 and 1958, Oliver Steele in 1957, and Matthew Bruccoli in 1958. UVa alumni who were flourishing in the book world were obvious candidates--people such as Hinman, Miller, or John D. Gordan, Curator of the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library (who spoke in 1954). C. Waller Barrett, whose collection of American literature would make the UVa library the preeminent repository of such materials, was likewise a natural choice (in 1951 and 1962). The arrangements for Gordon Ray's talk on 20 April 1966 show how the Society might go about planning a visit by someone with less direct ties to the University. Ray was already well known to many in the Charlottesville academic and bibliographic community, especially through his work as a Victorian scholar and his presidency of the Guggenheim Foundation and the Grolier Club. On 24 January of that year, Bowers, who had to be ever alert for articles for Studies , sent a brief note to Massey: We ought to ask Gordon Ray to give a BibSoc talk? Not only is he Mr. Guggenheim, but he writes up good, publishable lectures I could use in SB . I'll guarantee the audience from the graduate students. Massey accordingly wrote Ray, extending these terms: We can offer you a literate audience, a sum sufficient to cover travel expenses but no honorarium, a decent bed and an even more decent dinner with even more decent wines in my own home, your choice of a suitable subject, and a date agreeable to you. (3 March 1966) Ray accepted (14 March), the date was agreed on, and the subject of the talk chosen from the possibilities Ray had suggested: Fredson Bowers . . . prefers your talk on "Victorian Society and the Victorian Novel" for its appeal to graduate students. We might at some future date have the opportunity to hear your paper on Sydney Smith. (17 March 1966) Ray flew into Charlottesville the morning of the 20th in time for lunch at the Masseys, where guests included many of the people he had declared (on 18 March) he hoped to see while in town: "the Blotners and the Ehrenpreises . . . the Barretts, the Bowers, the Shannons." His McGregor Room talk that evening on "Victorian Society and the Victorian Novel" was well received, and he returned to New York the next day. Bowers never did snare an article from Ray for Studies , although three years later in Ray's Foreword to The American Writer in England: An Exhibition (from Barrett's collection at UVa) he sided with Bowers in the debate that had arisen in the New York Review of Books over the editing of American writers, and he provided what proved to be the most cogent assessment of the controversy. Still other visitors were pleased to book a Charlottesville engagement as part of a wider speaking tour. The recently published memoirs of Barbara Kaye ( Second Impression , 1995) offer insight into such a stop from the visitor's point of view. In 1951 she accompanied her husband Percy Muir to speak to the Society on 24 October. The night before, he had given his talk "Rogues and Vagabonds in the Book Trade" at the Folger Library in Washington; they rode the C&amp;O down to Charlottesville, visited the University and Monticello, dined at the Bowers home, went to the Society meeting, and then caught the 10:30 train for New York. The exhaustion created by such a pace may explain the slippery grasp of details in her account of their visit to "the university building" at the "University of North Virginia," where an "unusual and attractive feature" of the campus was a wall, which "stands there no longer." The repast on the Bowers terrace was the "typical southern meal" that Mrs. Bowers, Nancy Hale, had promised: "southern fried chicken followed by strawberry shortcake." Barbara Kaye seemed taken aback to discover that Nancy Hale had written more novels than she had, but she found the Bowerses "good company" and as "human and friendly as everyone else we met." She enjoyed Charlottesville, but "Bill Jackson's schedule [for the Muir tour] allowed for no loitering, and after Percy had delivered his `Rogues and Vagabonds' talk at the university, the Bowerses saw us off on the night train" (208). Although the evenings with formal papers were the most frequent Society gatherings, the group also met under other circumstances. The annual business meeting of the Society, chiefly to elect officers, eventually was combined with an evening lecture, but initially it served as the occasion for a "members only" introduction to special items in the University library or a viewing of films on printing or illustration. Beginning in the fall of 1949 and continuing at least to 1952, the Society sponsored a number of "Student Round Tables," informal discussion of bookbinding, type faces, imposition, and printing (including a demonstration of a hand press by Charles E. ("Chic") Moran, Jr., of the University Printing Office). These in turn led to the library's sponsorship of "Browsing Room Talks," "in part successor to the Society's Seminar talks" according to the Society's Secretary's News Sheet ( SNS ) 15. (Massey himself gave a Browsing Room Talk on Joyce on 18 March 1958.) In the winter of 1952-53 the Society and library together sponsored an experimental series of hour-long "Tea Meetings" in which, according to SNS 25, it is planned to have some one person available to lead the discussion that may result from the announcement of a topic: (1) a subject connected with book collecting; (2) discussion of special collections in the University of Virginia Library; (3) discussion of special functions of the Library; (4) a subject in technical bibliography. Four of these were given: by Walter Harding of the English Department, on collecting Thoreau; by Mrs. Eleanor Shea, Society Councilor, on the T. Catesby Jones Print Collection of the University; by Harvey Deal, University reference librarian, on the use of the Union Catalog in research; and by John Cook Wyllie on "The Forms of Twentieth- Century Cancels." When Wyllie's paper under that title was published in PBSA in 1953, he noted that it "had its origin as one of a series of talks on twentieth-century bibliographical problems prepared at the request of the student seminar of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia." Tea and all it entailed was also a customary way for the Society to honor special guests, from at least the time in May 1951 when "The Secretary and Mrs. Wyllie" served "refreshments in the Library Staff Room immediately following the talk in order to give members an opportunity to meet the Barretts," and in 1953 to honor F. C. Francis of the British Museum, through 1967, when the visitor of distinction was Keith I. D. Maslen from the University of Otago in New Zealand. The various interests to which the Society's constitution committed it all found expression in its formal meetings, but some members wished to follow particular interests more intensively. Accordingly, the budget for 1959 introduced a line for "`Typogs' and Student bibliographical awards." The linking of those two endeavors suggests that the "Typogs," later to be called the "Typographical Section" of the Society and to receive a separate budget allocation, were considered an additional way of serving University students. The student newspaper, the Cavalier Daily , described the organization this way: About a dozen members of the Society have formed a sub-group interested in typography. This group holds monthly meetings. The "typogs" own a printing press in the basement of Cocke Hall [perhaps the only building designed by Stanford White to be used for such purposes]. According to Mr. William Runge, secretary of the Society and chairman of this sub-group, members can print anything from their own woodcuts or Christmas cards to books. . . . Any member of the Society is eligible for membership in the "typogs." (11 May 1962) The size of the group fluctuated; the core members were Runge, Chic Moran, Charles Smith, and Joan Scholes--all non-students. An article in the June 1963 issue of the University's Alumni News said that participants "number from 15 to 20 (the total varies)," while thirty members attended the luncheon on 30 May 1963 honoring Smith on his retirement. Luncheons in the cafeteria of Newcomb Hall, the student union, were one of the two main occasions on which the group manifested its corporate existence. Beginning in the fall of 1959, members met at 12:30 on Wednesdays, often accompanying their lunches with informal talks (such as those by Warren Chappell, book designer and artist, who spoke about type design on 24 May 1962, and A. Samuels, President of Charlottesville's Allen Company, speaking on processes for color separation on 7 November 1962). The soul of the group, however, lay in its small printing establishment. In 1962 members adopted for it the name "Cockescraw Press," with a crowing rooster designed by Smith as its device. According to the Richmond Times- Dispatch , The name comes from two sources--Cocke Hall, home of the University art department, where the press has its quarters, and the grinding mechanism of a chicken. Apparently Harvey Gill [actually Deal], University reference librarian who supplied the name, envisioned the press crew spending its time mashing type and grinding machinery, Runge said. (20 August 1963) (Before assuming that name, the fledgling establishment was briefly known as the "Ruptured Rooster Press.") At its peak of activity, in 1963, the Press had "two foot- powered printing presses, a few fonts of handset type, two proof presses (hand operated) and various other pieces of equipment," according to the Times-Dispatch . Most of the apparatus had been donated; the Society, however, purchased the workhorse of the operation, a 12" x 18" Chandler and Price press, recognizing not only the delight but also the instruction that would result. The printers typically would meet on Monday nights, generally breaking off by 11:00 or 11:15 in order, according to Runge, to get a beer before midnight at the Gaslight Coffee House on West Main Street. Other deadlines were more problematic for the group; as Runge told the Alumni News , in order to have something printed one needed to "Just ask us and then wait a couple of years for us to do it." Under pressure of time, the Press would sometimes have its compositions printed by the University Printing Office--which at other times would set copy in linotype for the Cockescravians when their supply of type was too limited. (When those situations coalesced, the Cockescraw contribution was limited to design work.) The largest printing jobs of the Press tended to be programs--for the Society itself, as on the occasion of its joint meeting with the Baltimore Bibliophiles on 11-12 May 1963, and, from February 1962 through April 1964, for the twenty-fourth through thirtieth Peters Rushton Seminars in Contemporary Prose and Poetry, the successors to McGregor Room Seminars that had in fact served earlier as models for Society meetings in that room. An undergraduate member of the Press, Gene Blumenreich, was editor-in-chief of the student literary magazine Plume and Sword , and with his staff printed its covers there. The two largest projects were booklets: Atcheson Laughlin Hench: A Check List, Nineteen Hundred and Twenty-one, Nineteen Hundred and Sixty-two , a 1962 production to commemorate the work of the Society's third president and sometime Press member, and William B. O'Neal's Charles Smith: His Work in Book Design: A Checklist (one form of which was issued as SNS 50), in conjunction with a McGregor Room exhibition of Smith's typographical work opening on 16 May 1963, to honor him on the occasion of his retirement from the University. The surprise reception and luncheon the Cockescraw Press held for Smith on 30 May, with Warren Chappell as toastmaster and illustrator of a menu- keepsake, marked the apogee of the group. When Smith left the Art Department that he had joined permanently in 1947, serving as its first chairman for most of that time, so did the Press's claim on space in the departmental quarters. Though as late as the following spring the Press was still printing Rushton Seminar programs, minutes of the Society's Council meeting on 23 October 1965 record its quick demise: Mr. Runge reported that the typogs were in fact without a home, and that the press would be moved shortly to a storage area. No activity would be carried on therefore until such time as a printing shop can be found. Interest in printing itself did not die as readily, however, and the minutes of 18 September 1971 offer a brighter note: Mr. Stubbs reported that several groups have recently asked that the former Cockescraw Press be put back in working order and made available for their use. The press, which is the property of the Society, has been in storage at Birdwood for several years; but Mr. Frantz has said that he would like to make Library space available for it. Mr. Beaurline therefore moved that the press be donated to the Library; this motion passed without dissent. By 14 June of the next year Kendon Stubbs was able to write Massey, then in London: You might be interested to know that the old Cockescraw press has been put back in working condition; and a little broadside has been produced on it, of which I have a copy for you when you return. We might want to consider using this press for some small keepsake at some time in the future. The "little broadside" contained a passage from John Donne's Devotions upon Emergent Occasions , and the press was the Chandler and Price, which formed the nucleus of what over the next twenty years was known as the Alderman Press, on the first floor of Alderman Library. There the press itself was subsequently used to print the menu-keepsake for Fredson Bowers's retirement dinner on 26 October 1974 ("by C.S. &amp; K.S. for I.C."--that is, Clinton Sisson and Kendon Stubbs for Irby Cauthen); type for the Society's limited edition of Faulkner's Marionettes (1975.3 in the accompanying list) was also set there. In the mid 1970s the establishment added a replica of an eighteenth-century common press, built chiefly by Lester Beaurline of the English Department and Clinton Sisson of the library, in order to provide better facilities for teaching bibliography. One way for the Society to serve its wider communities was to host meetings with or for other organizations. Some of these groups were local--the University Library (whose distinction from the Society was often unclear), the Medical School Library, the student History and English clubs, the University Press, and the local branch of the English Speaking Union. But soon they were also national, beginning with a joint meeting with the Bibliographical Society of America on 9-10 May 1952. The BSA met the first day, with talks by A. H. Greenly, Henry R. Wagner, and William A. Jackson. The following day Philip Williams, Irby Cauthen, Joseph Graves, and Fredson Bowers spoke at the BSUVa sessions, Bowers serving for the first time as the heavy artillery that the Society would roll out to salute visiting scholarly organizations. He gave the only talk when the Grolier Club came to Charlottesville on 24-25 October 1958 (at which time the local newspaper noted John Carter's delight in examining the library's Michael Sadleir- Robert Black collection of gothic novels), he gave the talk at the banquet when the Baltimore Bibliophiles held a joint meeting with the Society on 11-12 May 1963, and he spoke at the Saturday evening dinner when the Pittsburgh Bibliophiles visited on 24-25 September 1966. (Besides at the inaugural meeting in 1947, Bowers addressed the Society as well on 9 April 1957, 10 April 1958, and 20 March 1961--more often than any other speaker.) Despite its power, this ordnance seems not to have been overwhelming; one Baltimore visitor wrote that "Fredson Bowers capped the evening in a fascinating way," and another praised the "delightful dinner with Dr. Bowers making wisdom painless, even in the abstruse reaches of mechanized bibliographical description." The Society also worked with a variety of other groups, in a number of ways. In its early days, for instance, it held a coffee for a regional meeting of the Virginia State Printers' Association (5 December 1953), and it hosted the Walpole Society (7 May 1954) and the Manuscript Society of America (27 May 1955); years later it co- sponsored, with the University's Center for Advanced Studies and the English Department, an Eightieth-Birthday Conference for Fredson Bowers (20-23 April 1985). One reason for multiple sponsorship of events was that the line separating the activities of people who served both as Society officers and as representatives of other organizations was not always clear; consequently, when an exhibition seemed in order for delegates to the International Congress of Archives (14 May 1966), for example, it was jointly arranged by the Society and the University Library. (The next day in the lobby of the library's Barrett Room the Society hosted a tea honoring two of the visitors, Sir David Evans, former Keeper of the Public Records, and Mr. Peter Walne, County Archivist of Hertfordshire.) The overlap of commitments and sponsorships is particularly evident in the case of Wyllie. Typical is the announcement in the final issue of another organization's News Sheet , that of the Bibliographical Society of America, at a time (1951) when the youthful Virginia society needed all the attention from Wyllie that it could garner: "Publication of the Index to the Society's Papers [that is, of the BSA] . . . has been delayed by the death of Mr. David M. Matteson. Mr. Matteson's work will be carried on by Mr. John Cook Wyllie of the University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville, Virginia." Recognition of the importance of serving the wider bibliographical world was indeed a persistent characteristic of the Society. When in 1958 Donald Hyde as Vice-President of the BSA organized regional advisory councils, Dorothy Miner, who as chairman of the Southern Area Board solicited Wyllie's participation, cautiously tested whether his work for the Virginia society had made his interests more parochial. He happily accepted the post, pointing out that he had been a member of the BSA longer than he had been of the Virginia society (and that he had no inclination to loosen that tie). Paradoxically, service that Society leaders could divert from the Society to the larger world worked to strengthen the Society--and in that way too served the larger cause of bibliography. Wyllie was not formally acting in his Society capacity when, as Secretary of the Rare Book Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries, he arranged for its first major conference to be held at the University (18-20 June 1959). One accomplishment of that visit, however, was to establish even more indelibly the connection between the University and the care and study of books. Fifteen years later, on 30 June-2 July 1974, when the ACRL's Rare Book and Manuscripts Section Pre-Conference again met in Charlottesville, the effect was the same-- except that this time the Society formally participated by sponsoring a cocktail party, quietly funded by Massey, before the final banquet. Though the activities of the Bibliographical Society and the University Library sometimes could not be differentiated, one special function the Society served from the start was as a Friends group for the library. (Indeed, about six months after Wyllie died, C. Waller Barrett began to organize the group called the Associates of the University of Virginia Library and asked Massey to serve on the Sponsors' Committee.) An advantage of having supporters under the immediate direction of the people they purported to help lay in the efficiency of the operation. Besides sponsoring book-related talks in the McGregor Room, as the Associates would do later (sometimes in conjunction with the Society, as for the lecture on 23 November 1970 by Edwin Wolf 2nd), the Society solicited donations for the library and arranged exhibitions. In Massey's presidential report for 1948 (circulated with SNS 9) he called attention to "the valuable books acquired through the Society, many of which have been described in the Secretary's News Letters" (e.g. in SNS 2 and 3, and later 10 and 13). After the visit by Mrs. Roy Arthur (Rachel McMasters Miller) Hunt and the exhibition of her botanical books in 1952, Wyllie wrote Linton and Mary Massey, Two immediate results of your Hunt operation that are indirect enough for you never otherwise to hear of: gift of an incunabulum from Mr. Bemiss . . . with a nice little 16th-C emblem book accompanying it. And, Mr. Taylor has asked me to come by his Long Island home in June to pick out something he can give to the University. The incunabulum, incidentally, is in a Roger Payne binding. Very nice. (3 May 1952) But whereas building the library's collections may have been an implicit goal of the Society, providing displays of books was explicitly announced as early as Wyllie's 1946 letter accompanying his questionnaire (even if a motivation behind such exhibits might ultimately have also been to develop University collections). In his 1948 report Massey reported on the development of this goal, linking it with the Society's attempt to spur interest in collecting at the student level: Under the auspices of the Society we instituted a series of exhibitions, chiefly of rare books belonging to members. They ranged from a display of flower prints by Redouté, through a run of the first editions of William Faulkner [this exhibition, the first, was by Massey], to the magnificent collection of Virginiana shown by Mr. Arthur Kyle Davis. In the name of the Society a competition was organized among students of the University with suitable prizes offered for the best three collections of books, which were later shown in the cases of the McGregor and Public Documents rooms of the Alderman Library after awards had been made by a faculty committee. The Council proposes to continue both projects, the exhibition of rare books, prints and maps, and the student competition. He had further presentations to report the following year (in his 1949 report distributed with SNS 13): Two member exhibitions were held in the name of the Society: Mr. Willoughby Newton's collection of the first editions of T. S. Eliot; and a display of Mr. John Kelly's novel, "Alexander's Feast," unique in the sense that it showed the progression of a novel step by step from preliminary sketch to finished book. Over the years (to the present) the books of the student winners have continued to provide interesting displays in the library, even after the practice of showing members' collections faded. Numerous other opportunities also arose for exhibitions. Sometimes speakers would bring their own materials--a pattern established with Chalmers Gemmill's Baskerville talk in 1946. (That collection then went on public display at the library.) One of the earliest attempts to provide such visual aids miscarried when Nathan Van Patten's train from Stanford was snowbound in Utah and he was unable to speak on 10 February 1949 and show his books published in Greenland. But others did successfully tell and show, among them Eric Kessler, from the Swiss Legation, on "The Contributions of Switzerland to Book Making" (9 March 1950); Irvin Kerlan, Acting Director of the Food and Drug Administration, on children's books (15 May 1953); John D. Gordan, from New York, on "The Collecting of the First Works of English and American Authors" (8 October 1954); W. Hugh Peal, also from New York, on letters of Charles Lamb (4 November 1955); and Charles Feinberg, businessman from Detroit, on "Walt Whitman's Difficulties with Publishers and Book Sellers" (15 February 1957). Sometimes the library arranged relevant displays from its own collections, as it did for Calhoun's talk "John Bartlett and His `Familiar Quotations'" (30 September 1957), for Feinberg's return on 21 March 1958 (where his own examples were supplemented with holdings of the Barrett Collection); and Richard Harwell from Emory University (12 February 1953), whose exhibition consisted of sound recordings of Confederate songs, complemented with a display of Confederate sheet music arranged by Miss Ruth Byrd of the Alderman staff. The Society furthermore cooperated in publicizing travelling exhibitions in which its own involvement is unclear--a display of British Books arranged by the American Institute of Graphic Arts, for instance (November 1950); a model paper- making machine from the Hammermill Paper Company (December 1951); a show on Modern Swedish Bookbinding (December 1952-January 1953); and books from private presses, organized by The Society of Printers of Boston and including the work of Society members Hunter Middleton, Joe Graves, P. J. Conkwright, Ben Grauer, and Willis Shell (October 1953). Another exhibition of private presswork opened with a Society- sponsored talk by James Babb, Librarian of Yale, on 16 October 1953. The Society's involvement with exhibitions reached full expression with two major ones it supported directly: those of botanical books of Mrs. Roy Arthur Hunt (accompanied by her talk on 25 April 1952) and of the typographical work of Charles W. Smith (opening on 16 May 1963). An exhibition of quite a different kind consisted of what might now be known as performance art: a presentation of Charlton Hinman's mechanical collating machine in action. Wyllie had whetted public curiosity about the invention as early as December 1947 in his Secretary's News Sheet 5: Dr. Charlton Hinman, who addressed the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia last June [on "Why 79 First Folios?"], has caused a flurry of interest in England with his "mechanized collation". Mr. F. C. Francis comments on it in The Library for June 1947, and there is a paragraph about it expressing the "liveliest interest" in The Times Literary Supplement for September 27th. Wyllie's inveterate interest in technology prompted him to purchase one of the first of the new machines for the library, and the interest of Hinman's former dissertation director Bowers in textual study prompted Bowers to spur his students to use it. A burst of publicity accompanied the arrival of the device in early 1956; with the enthusiasm that characterized the early Society in general and Studies in Bibliography in particular, Bowers told the Charlottesville Daily Progress that "A whole new field of investigation is opening before us" (11 February 1956). Given the research then going on at the University, he was particularly excited that "This equipment will reveal previously unsuspected printings from [nineteenth-century printing] plates, and will put these in their proper order." With his recollection of problems he had earlier tackled himself but also his characteristic practicality, he went on: Such information has textual importance, but also there is a dollars and cents value to libraries and collectors in knowing which really were the earliest printings of the first editions of American classics. We can now proceed with confidence to the solution of such problem books as Washington Irving's "Wolfert's Roost" [the subject of Bowers's presentation at the very first Society meeting nine years earlier] and various of Mark Twain's works. At the annual business meeting of the Society a couple weeks later (on 27 February 1956), Matthew Bruccoli, one of Bowers's students who was to make great use of the machine, demonstrated it for members and for guests from the student English Club. Meanwhile news of the arrival had spread to Richmond. The book editor of the Times-Dispatch , Lewis F. Ball, devoted one of his Sunday columns to it, in the process providing probably the most vivid description the machine has ever received: There it stood in front of the fireplace in the McGregor Room of the Alderman Library at the University of Virginia--a bulky, box-like metal monster almost six feet tall with a row of toggle switches, flashing lights and a generally sinister appearance. Its creator, Charlton Hinman, stood by as if to protect the coven of the Bibliographical Society, gathered in solemn sabbath, from any hostile gesture on the part of the machine. Here, surely, was Frankenstein Redivivus and a new creature. It turned out, though, that the gadget was entirely harmless-- indeed downright benevolent. . . . (11 March 1956) Other guests invoked similar imagery. During the Society's preparation of a bibliography of his writings, James Branch Cabell wrote Wyllie after a visit to the library that "I liked too finding out something about that mystic Hinman machine" (28 January 1958). After the 1963 meeting of the Baltimore Bibliophiles in the McGregor Room, one member noted in her letter of thanks to Massey that "I was ever so glad to see the Hinman machine--a creature about which I had heard so much and only now understand." Hinman's collator, whose presence at UVa was the product of the interests of early members of the Bibliographical Society, remains in use today. Because the machines were expensive and generally required some understanding of the bibliographical purposes they might serve, only a few dozen libraries ever acquired them; because many libraries that did so have since removed them from service, the University of Virginia library has assumed renewed significance as one of the best places in the world to conduct bibliographical research. Behind the public face of the Society lay not only weekly attention by its officers and committees but also formal meetings of the Council twice a year. From at least 1949 these were held at Kinloch; the business session would be followed by a dinner proverbial in local circles for its excellence. The 4 June 1977 occasion was a landmark, prompting this tribute from the Council: Tonight, for the fiftieth time in its history, this Society will gather around the Massey table for gustatory refreshment after labors intellectual. Each time we have been introduced to new delights or we have discovered old favorites inimitably improved. To compile a census of the menus would be to describe a tour through the best meals of Albemarle and many another county. . . . Sharing again this hospitality so graciously given, we look forward (with some understandable selfishness) tonight--and to other times to come--to hearing that "Dinner, Mrs. Massey, is served." This tradition had continued even after the death of Linton Massey on 9 November 1974. In the memorial resolution Bowers read before the University faculty, he observed that "The menus of these dinners, preserved over the course of twenty-five years, themselves deserve publication as a bibliography of dining. The minutes of the meetings we may leave in decent obscurity." Massey's wife Mary, who had always been close to the Society, continued to host the Council until her poor health forced cessation after the 17 November 1989 dinner, though the Council visited Kinloch for a business meeting one last time on 30 April 1993. The minutes that Bowers spoke of recorded official business, of course, but those of 13 December 1958 show the potential inclusiveness of the Secretary's observations: There was a brief interlude in the formal meeting while the President refilled drinks amid cross currents of discussion, the most interesting of which seemed to be that carried on by Messrs. Carrière and Hench on the topic of sinning and the Catholic Church. Meanwhile the Society's annual business meetings, which had begun as "members only" occasions for electing officers, modifying the constitution, and engaging in some special activity such as examining treasures of the University Library, viewing movies on book production, or watching the Hinman Collator in action, had already in early years lost their distinctiveness as special occasions and had been blended into one of the evening lecture meetings (from the mid 1950s to the mid '60s) or held as short late- afternoon sessions attended only by Council members. From 1969 through 1992 the latter were held in the office of the University Librarian, with the meetings successively establishing records for their brevity. The fortunes of the annual meetings mirrored the fate of the public lecture series, whose last talks were sponsored in 1967. The subsequent abandonment coincides with the 1968 death of Wyllie, whose loss deprived the Society of crucial energy in a program that had already been confronted by decreased interest. Attracting an audience had, in fact, been a challenge from the start. As early as 18 April 1949 Massey had written Bowers proposing an informal series of talks that might lure more people (that suggestion soon led to the Student Round Tables). Some guide to actual attendance can be gleaned from Wyllie's advice to Howard Mott before his talk on 8 November 1951; he told Mott to expect twenty to thirty people. The day after Gerald Stevenson addressed the Society on private presses in Iowa (on 4 January 1962), Chalmers Gemmill wrote Massey, "I thought that Mr. Stevenson did a good job last night. It was too bad that more people did not come out to hear his talk." In the same letter of 18 April 1949 Massey had pondered the appropriateness of the setting for the lectures: Crowd Psychology, applied to our meetings in the McGregor Room, would doom us with a sense of inadequacy and failure. Our numbers are too few for so large and spacious a room. We should seek other smaller, possibly more congenial quarters for our meetings, so we would not be overwhelmed by the very magnitude of the McGregor Room, perfect though it may be in atmosphere and location. Bowers responded the next day saying that he agreed thoroughly; a few years later he had occasion to express his thoughts more fully to Massey about a number of the issues at stake. I do believe that meetings should be open to non-members and should be extensively publicized. I do think we ought to have more than four a year, since that is almost complete inactivity so far as having an organization that through its meetings can put an impress on university life. I do think that the meetings have a little too much neglected literary-textual subjects and speakers that would appeal mostly to the graduate students, who used to attend meetings very frequently. And we ought to depend on them to pass on good news about the Society to other places when they graduate. Thus Feinberg's talk was almost ideal because it was about a literary figure in whom there is a general interest. It would be nice if we could work up a talk on Faulkner bibliography this spring. Why not? I think we have sometimes thought too narrowly of subjects as just bookish ones, and this has had the effect of alienating the student audience and others. That is, I do think that most local members of the Society are NOT book collectors, and to have talks that chiefly appeal to the collector a good deal of the time is to appeal to the wrong audience. Some yes--but where is the more general talk we used to have? . . . I don't think a small gathering is conspicuous in McGregor room if we gather in a circle around the speaker in the big chairs. And it's a hell of a sight pleasanter. (23 February 1957) Even after the Society had gotten on its feet, then, it continued to wrestle about its appropriate emphasis. Whether the selections of speakers happened to fit with prevailing Society goals or not, they had immediate practical effects: in an overview of Society activities, the Cavalier Daily reported that "Attendance at meetings varies from 20 to 150 or more" (11 May 1962). With only two exceptions, assistance with the talk by Edwin Wolf 2nd on 23 November 1970 and, notably, with the Charlottesville conference honoring Fredson Bowers on his eightieth birthday (20-23 April 1985), the Society sponsored no public lectures for twenty-seven years. That hiatus ended in 1994. Under the leadership of its new president, G. Thomas Tanselle, the Society's annual business meeting on 22 April was combined with a program--in the McGregor Room--conducted by local graduate students. Moderated by Monique Dull, the session included Carter Hailey ("George Steevens and the Revision[s] of Johnson's Dictionary "), Kelly Tetterton ("Paperbacks as an Area of Bibliographical Study: The Case of Virginia Woolf's Orlando "), David Gants ("Pictures for the Page: Techniques in Watermark Reproduction, Enhancement and Analysis"), and Peter Byrnes ("Byron and the Pirate: The Case of Poems upon His Domestic Circumstances "). Besides reestablishing the Society as a visible presence at the University, the aim was to recognize and encourage student bibliographical activity by providing a public venue for discussion of that work. Students were able to benefit further by drawing on the advice of Council members as they prepared their talks. The program was remarkably successful, though by skimming the cream of current work it reduced the array of papers available the next year. For the following meeting the Society consequently pursued another idea it had considered, that of hearing from University faculty members doing bibliographical or textual work other than in the English Department, where traditionally the Society's chief academic constituency lay. The speaker that year, on 21 April 1995, was Gary Anderson from Religious Studies, who addressed the group on " The Life of Adam and Eve in Text and Iconography." By the next year another crop of excellent student papers had matured; with David Gants as moderator at the 29 March 1996 meeting, Frank E. Grizzard, Jr., spoke on "A Collector's Progress; or, Why I Have 500 Copies of the Same Book [ Pilgrim's Progress ]," Elizabeth A. Jordan talked about "Imposing a Canon: The Curious Printing of Bell's Poets of Great Britain ," and Andrew M. Stauffer examined the textual implications of "Byron's Monumental Epitaph for His Dog." The revived public meetings convincingly showed that bibliographical study at the University had a promising future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III To stimulate interest and encourage excellence in two kinds of activities that interested the Society, it soon established two contests, one in book collecting, for all students of the University, and another in printing, for printers throughout the State. The collecting competition, begun in the Society's first year and held in 1996 for the forty-first time, has proven the chief way for the Society to serve the element of the University otherwise little affected by its activities--its undergraduates. When Wyllie was presented with the Raven Award by University students in 1952, the outstanding reason noted by the undergraduate presenters was in fact the inauguration and continuation of the contest. Wyllie and Massey were the chief promoters of the competition (Bowers served as a judge the first year and a couple times thereafter), with Wyllie coordinating activities on the University Grounds (including collecting entries at the Rare Book Room) and Massey anonymously funding the prizes (for over two decades). The University's rare book curators have always been members of the Society's Council and hence logical members of the Awards Committee; besides their ability to assess the quality of collections, they have a professional interest on behalf of the library in knowing what kind of books are being brought together around them. Other judges have been drawn from the Society's Council, from the English Department faculty, and from the wider Charlottesville membership. (The report of the 1964 committee also pointed out that "We were happy to be joined by Mr. Jacob Blanck in our deliberations.") Irby Cauthen, who had won first prize as a graduate student in 1949 with his collection on the architecture of Charleston, South Carolina, joined the panel as a "former winner" in 1951; a few years later he returned to the University as a member of the English Department faculty and from 1960 through 1989 he served on the committee, most of the time as its chair, with the rare book curators William Runge and, later, Julius Barclay. During those years the drop-off point for entries was either the English Department or the Rare Book Room, reflecting not only the people involved but also the interests strongly represented. Though others replaced Cauthen and Barclay after 1989 following their retirements from the University, the contest instructions have continued to specify that entries be submitted to people in the English Department or what is now Special Collections. The regulations for the contest changed over the years, but one ground rule remained: as Wyllie told the student paper, the Cavalier Daily , on 22 February 1949, entries are judged "not on the basis of expense but on the coherence" of the books submitted. After the first contest (in the spring of 1948), in which all entries were considered together, the Council invited a student member of the committee, George Williams, to systemize the rules. Beginning the next year entries were invited in two categories: "Class A: Collections which have been assembled with primarily a bibliographical interest in mind. (Such a collection might include all the editions of any one work or any one author, first editions of modern poets, association copies, or items of this type.) Class B: Collections which have been assembled with primarily an interest in study, reading, or scholarship in mind. (Such a collection might include various works relating to any field or fields.)" With an implicit acknowledgement that not all meritorious entries fit one of those groupings, the Committee intermittently added awards for "Best" or "Unusual" student libraries in the 1960s and '70s. The challenge of attracting an equal number of entries in the divisions and the difficulty of maintaining a clear distinction between these overlapping sections prompted a return to an all-encompassing single category in 1990. The biggest shift during those four decades occurred in the contests for 1956 through 1961, when the "bibliographical" award was presented not specifically for book collecting but for bibliographical achievement in general. As the announcement of the 1960 contest described the honor, the prize "goes to a student who is interested in some phase of bibliography, either the exploration of a particular text or a collection of a series of editions by one particular writer." Under such guidelines, the award went in 1956, for instance, to George Walton Williams "in recognition of his bibliographical skills, and notably for his researches in the fields of Elizabethan and Charlestonian bibliography" and in 1959 to Donald E. Glover for "his study of the manuscript of Bret Harte's `Rose of Tuolomne,'" a manuscript in the Barrett collection of American literature in the University library. Other "bibliographical" winners in those years were Robert K. Turner (1957), Matthew Bruccoli (1957 and 1958), and Oliver Steele (1958 and 1961). The judges' verdicts were subsequently vindicated, for each of these winners went on to publish significant bibliographical scholarship (four of the five in Studies in Bibliography ). Another temporary change in those years was that the names of potential candidates were solicited from the University faculty. Turner's award in 1957 ultimately stemmed from the nomination Bowers sent to Massey: "It would be appropriate enough to give the award for bibliography to Robert K. Turner, who is doing a bibliographical dissertation, and working on Nicholas Okes the Elizabethan printer and the text of Beaumont and Fletcher's Maid's Tragedy ." The response of the 1956 collecting winner, Charles N. Biondi, reveals that contestants in that category too were sought out; in his letter of thanks he not only expressed amazement at being chosen but recalled his surprise at hearing of the contest itself ("In fact I was not even aware of the practice of the Society to give this sort of recognition to student collectors"). Biondi's award showed that the collecting portion of the competition had also changed, for he was broadly honored "in recognition of his talents as a bibliophile, and notably for his collecting interests in the fields of early prints and fore edge paintings of American scenes." Attracting the attention of potential contestants was always a challenge. In early years Wyllie prepared announcements that teachers were asked to read in class; the weight of the request increased in the 1960s, when Irby Cauthen, chair of the Awards Committee, issued these to his faculty as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. The University News Service circulated word of impending contests and of their outcomes, resulting in stories in both the student paper and the Charlottesville Daily Progress . Word also extended far beyond the local community. In his column "Books Alive" in the Chicago Sunday Tribune of 29 June 1952, Vincent Starrett noted that "Top awards in the University of Virginia's annual student book collectors' contest for 1952 went to young men [Robert Campbell, Jr., and Norris Randolph] who collected first editions of Lord Byron and Oscar Wilde." This attention was not unambiguous, however; it appeared in the "No Comment Department" along with a list of terms for different forms of button collecting and with announcement of a new edition of Shakespeare in which "`all the famous and most quotable passages' will be printed in red." In 1967 the Society began to advertise the contest through posters on University bulletin boards. The original design, used at least four times, reflected its era: a brightly colored maze (changing its hue from one year to the next), with the pattern overwhelming the text located in the bottom quarter of the sheet. Posters in the mid and late '70s were almost entirely typographical; among them were a couple with orange and red type on off-white paper, and one printed in black and burgundy with the simple outlines of book covers (this one designed by a 1979 winner, Peter Brehm--whose collection was entitled "The Art and History of the Book"). The form introduced in 1980 continued through 1994--an oblong design with the competition title on the left and details of the contest on the open pages of a book to its right. The first of this series was the most unusual: the left-hand page had a running title, and the text below began in mid sentence. The right-hand page contained the Society's name and a colophon--including the number of the copy in an edition of 100. One of the surest ways of attracting participation was by offering prizes--cash every time, along with a year's membership in the Bibliographical Society, and sometimes a volume on book collecting (from 1984 through 1987), membership in the friends or "Associates" group of the University Library (from 1989), and gift certificates from local booksellers. (In 1952 the editor of the Amateur Book Collector also contributed a year's subscription.) In a letter on 9 March 1949 to student committee member George Williams, who apparently had suggested lower amounts, Massey explained the thinking behind his contributions: "Since I have already undertaken to provide privately whatever cash is needed for the prizes you will suffer no pain when I suggest two first prizes of $15 each, and two second prizes of $10 each. . . . My thought is simply to provide the impetus these larger sums would give to the hesitant or lazy student book collectors." For the first two years the first-place winner in each category received $15 (with descending amounts for other places); that amount rose to $20 in 1950 and then $25 in 1952, where it remained until it jumped to $100 in 1989. In 1948 C. C. Wells of the New Dominion Book Shop in Charlottesville awarded a $2.00 credit for all entrants who did not win one of the first three places; he again offered credits the following year, as did W. H. Lowdermilk and Co. of Washington, D.C. That year three other local bookstores-- Anderson Brothers, University Book Store, and Jameson Book Store--worked together and through their representative Roscoe S. Adams arranged further credits totalling $20.00 to winners of the first three places in each category. The four Charlottesville dealers together donated $32.00 in credits for the 1950 contest, but such contributions then faded away until they were resurrected in 1989. The booksellers' response to the invitation for each to provide a $25 gift certificates was enthusiastic ("Great idea!"; "I will be most happy to donate"; "I have long been a proponent of such an idea"), and nine dealers contributed that year (growing to twelve in 1996). In 1994 the Booksellers at 310 Market Street also held a reception for that year's winners. The renewed involvement of booksellers in the life of the Society not only marked a re-establishment of the relationship with one of the group's original constituencies but also helped the Society heighten the level of collecting awareness among students who were living in what long had been an active book town. With the award has also come a small bit of public recognition. In the early years the winners were announced with appropriate suspense at one of the Society's evening lectures. Winners who are graduating have their honor listed in the University's commencement program. For at least the first five years, and regularly since 1979, the winning entries have been displayed in the University's Alderman Library--the early ones for a week in the McGregor and Public Documents rooms, and more recently for a month in that building's entrance hall. Over the years of the contest 163 students have received awards, 11 of them twice and 7 of them three times. (The contest has also attracted entrants who were unsuccessful several times.) In part because books tended to loom large in the consciousness of English students and because organizers of the contest often were from that department, many of the collections contained books by or about English or American literary figures. The chronological span represented in the most recent contest-- from Ben Jonson to Generation X writers--has been characteristic. The alphabetical range of literary subjects and authors has also been broad: Arthurian literature, Robert Browning, John Bunyan, Edgar Rice Burroughs (especially Tarzan ), Erskine Caldwell (in lurid paperback), Charles Dickens, John Dos Passos, T. S. Eliot, "almost all editions of the complete works of George Farquhar," William Faulkner, Robert Frost, George Garrett, Ernest Hemingway, William Dean Howells, Jack Kerouac, D. H. Lawrence, George Meredith, the Sitwell family, Jesse Stuart, E. B. White, and Virginia Woolf. Related collections have focused on a genre or theme: manuscript diaries, eighteenth- century editions of fables, Greek and Latin classics, homosexuality and the homosexual in literature, French drama, and science fiction. (The 1964 commendations noted that Edward M. Turner, "the only undergraduate cited by the committee, has collected some 1,500 pieces of science fiction, a collection that, because of the collector's youth, indeed rivals the Clarkson collection at Harvard University which has 6,000 items.") English Department students have not collected only literary writers, however, nor have entrants been limited to English majors. Most schools of the University have been represented over the half century, with frequent participation especially from students in Government and Foreign Affairs, History, Law, and Physics. A number of times travel accounts have appeared, along with several collections of maritime history. Several students have offered books on Central and South America, including a 1000- item collection by William R. Woods in 1959. Asian civilization has incited several entries, as have the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Civil War and the Confederacy have proven popular, while other historical interests have found expression in books on old trials and on fifteenth-century France. The philosophy of science was the contribution of a graduate student in physics, and the arts have been represented by a variety of collections: Leonardo da Vinci, Hogarth prints, landscape gardening, architecture of Charleston, S.C., log houses, and a couple of impressive groupings on music. In 1953 Roy E. Clark, a second-year College student, presented books "Concerning all phases of music from the physical aspect of sound to musical work, and including technological aspects, information on sound reproducing systems, music theory, important personages--composers and artists, program notes, history, symphonic and chamber music scores." Eighteen years later Law student Teri Noel Towe won with a collection that "centers around music, musical biography, musical scores, books on keyboard instruments and keyboard music, books on recordings, and finally an extensive library of recordings numbering over 3,000 pieces." Collections on bridge and on wrestling showed equal devotion, as did one that perhaps serves to symbolize many of those in the Society's first half century, a 1964 entry by William S. Kable on "the history of the book." Though the contests have invariably attracted high quality entries, the number of contestants has fluctuated, thereby spurring periodic reflections about continuation of the undertaking. In June 1965 President Massey sent a memorandum to Council members in which he pondered the fate of what over more than a decade and a half had become a University institution: Those of us intimately concerned with the affairs of the Society from its very beginning may have wondered from time to time just how effective our various programs have been, one of these unquestionably being that contest for student book collectors which we have uniformly approved and promoted more as an abstraction than a tangible project capable of producing discernible results. Under the expert direction of Vice President Cauthen considerable progress has been made not only in strengthening this direct tie with the University and its graduate and undergraduate students, but also in arousing an interest in book collecting among them as opposed to a simple distribution of money to more or less deserving youngsters owning a few related books. The letters that he attached from recent winners were typical in their themes. George B. Goode, for example, made the most obvious but also the most important observation: "This has spurred my interests in book collecting"--adding that the award "raised my spirits at the most opportune time, in the midst of final exams." The encouragement the winners received was often as important as other considerations. In accepting the 1961 prize, for instance, Matthew Bruccoli wrote Massey that "As you know, I have received the research award [in 1957 and 1958], but I am even more pleased to be recognized as a collector." By the same token, the gifts of cash fueled the fire. Nathaniel P. Neblett observed in 1960 that "I shall be able to fill several gaps in my collection with this award," and James A. Means wrote the Society in 1970, "I am presently engaged in the rather difficult task of assembling a collection of Pope's works in early editions, and the Committee might be interested to know that their cash award will be spent in making an addition to this collection." Despite notable successes and emulation elsewhere ( SNS 18 reported that Dartmouth College had started a similar competition), questions about the contest's ongoing existence surfaced repeatedly starting in the late 1960s. The establishment in 1962 of the Amy Loveman National Award for student book collectors (for which the Society nominated local students) signalled a general interest in the activity early in that decade, but in 1968 Irby Cauthen reported to Massey that for the current local contest "Only these three entries have been received." His 1971 report pointed to further decline as well as rebound: "There were four entries this year, some improvement of the paucity of entries last year, and two of them describe truly outstanding collections." The next year was even better: "this year there were six entries of outstanding interest." But in 1974 the number was back down to three; Cauthen suggested that "The Executive Council may wish to consider whether to continue it with such a small response; contests such as this one seem to be losing their appeal among university students more rapidly than they should." A number of times the Council did vote to hold the contest biannually, although a consistent pattern did not readily develop (no contests were held in 1976, 1978, 1983, 1986, and 1988, and no entries were received in 1984). The Council determined most recently in 1990 that a two-year interval was needed for a suitable number of collections of sufficient quality to develop, and since then the competition has been held in the fall (instead of the spring, as previously) of even-numbered years. Many of the effects of the contest are visible only against the backdrop of a breadth of years. In 1984 Robert W. Kitchell, wrote Rare Book Curator and Society Councilor Julius Barclay, I recall your starting me on my book collecting two years ago with a lovely tour of the University's rare book room &amp; your offices. I was the fortunate recipient of a second prize for my E. B. White collection in 1982. Recently I straightened out my papers on this ongoing collection, and this reminded me of your early help to me. The collection has grown several times over with many signed pieces, uncorrected proofs, unusual items. I am proud of it. Thank you for the help. Maybe one day I will be allowed to redisplay the collection at UVA. This would be a treat. Many of the student collections led not only to greater ones but also to scholarly achievements based on them. The Pope collection to which James Means devoted his 1970 winnings came to include a unique volume of Pope's New Dunciad (reported in Notes and Queries in June 1973). Matthew Bruccoli's 1961 collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works presaged his role as the leading biographical scholar of that writer and also as the preeminent Fitzgerald collector. Maura Ives (1989) based her dissertation and a subsequent edition of George Meredith's short stories in large part on the copies she collected. Bradley Gunter (1967) had written his M.A. thesis on the subject of his collecting (T. S. Eliot), followed through with a dissertation on that author, and then produced three lists on Eliot for the Charles E. Merrill program in American Literature. Richard H. W. Dillard, whose collection of the writings of George Garrett (in 1964, the year the judges were advised by Jacob Blanck) "illustrated a high standard of the collection of the works of an author presently living and accessible," eventually wrote a book on Garrett. Two 1994 winners, Frank Grizzard (with his 500 copies of Pilgrim's Progress ) and Kelly Tetterton (with editions of Woolf's Orlando ) subsequently addressed an annual meeting of the Society about research stemming from their collections. (A 1996 winner, David L. Gants, who collected seventeenth-century editions of Ben Jonson for work on his bibliographical dissertation, had spoken earlier to the Society about his studies.) While these examples suggest something of the role of collecting and of the contest in the lives of these students, a glimpse of what the Society hoped the competition could be is best exemplified by the winner of the first contest in 1948, Arthur Parsons Bean, Jr. In the 1978 exhibition keepsake for the display of his Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell collection at the University of Virginia Library ( The Sitwells: A Tapestry of Talent ), Bean traced his progress as a collector: My interest began after being introduced to the Sitwell family by reading Left Hand, Right Hand! , the first volume of Sir Osbert Sitwell's richly descriptive, socially historical autobiography. Amazingly enough, I came across this volume in the library of our U. S. Navy headquarters in Plymouth, England, in January, 1944. Soon afterward, the real first step in collecting occurred when on leave in London, I asked in a well- known book store if there were any books by the Sitwells in stock. Although I had no idea at that time of becoming a collector , the "bug" had bitten, and the first purchases were made. In fact, the few items bought then plus another few led directly to the second step in the movement toward becoming a serious collector. This event took place in Charlottesville in April, 1948, when the University of Virginia Bibliographical Society sponsored a contest for student book collectors in which the emphasis was on unity of authorship or topical or physical characteristics. It is hard to realize now that my ten books won first prize and became the nucleus of the current collection. Looking back, it seems particularly fortuitous that, about the time this local contest was organized, on the wider horizon Dame Edith Sitwell and Sir Osbert Sitwell were involved in their first joint lecture tour in the United States. . . . I met Sir Osbert. . . . and was able to meet Dame Edith. This collecting spurred by the Society had direct scholarly fruit. On 29 September 1969 Bean, who was then teaching at American University in Washington, wrote Massey: Almost directly as the result of my collection of Sitwelliana, and after having both written and actual links with both Dr. Edith and Sir Osbert, last year I completed as a thesis for an M.A. in Library Science from Catholic University A Bio- Bibliography of Dr. Edith Sitwell . The 1978 library exhibition, whose keepsake also included contributions by Francis T. S. Sitwell, Kenneth Clark, and Mildred K. Abraham, was a dramatic reprise of the 1948 display there of Bean's core collection; the 10 books had grown to more than 500, along with hundreds of other documents and artifacts, and the fruits of three decades of loving labor were now brought in their full glory to the public. This episode of the Bibliographical Society's service to the University, first to its students and then to its wider community, drew to fitting completion when Bean subsequently donated the collection ("which," he said, "was really born here") to the University Library. Although in naming the Society its founders chose to align it more closely with the University than with the state as a whole, they remained alert to the community beyond Charlottesville. One way of manifesting that attention was to establish a contest for all printers of Virginia. In conjunction with the newly formed Virginia State Printers' Association, the Society sponsored three such competitions: in 1951 (for work produced from January 1950 through June 1951), 1952 (covering July 1951 through July 1952), and 1954 (for July 1952 through December 1953). The contest was created and conducted by President Massey and Secretary Wyllie, who duly signed the certificates that were awarded as prizes at the annual meeting of the Association. The appreciation was immediate: on 31 October 1951 August Dietz, Jr., a Richmond printer and a founder of the Association, wrote Massey, "You and John have started something for the printers in Virginia that will be a lasting memorial to both of you." Entries were invited in fifteen categories (sixteen the third year), though the Society reserved the right to subdivide any section. The official categories ranged from books, pamphlets, and programs to prints, calendars, direct mail materials, and business forms. (Newspapers were excluded, for they were judged separately by the Virginia Press Association.) Entries poured in: 200 the first year, over 300 the second. Although the number of submissions the third year is not clear, it implicitly was high, for the number of "Certificates of Special Merit" for "special contributions to Virginia printing" was larger than ever before. The Society seems to have developed these awards as a form of "Honorable Mention" in order to expand the number of printers it could recognize. The same impulse operated from the start as the Society exercised its option to subdivide categories. Already in the first year separate awards had been given for books produced for Virginia publishers and for out-of-state publishers, and for exhibition programs as well as dance programs and commencement programs. The judges were drawn from the ranks of Bibliographical Society members in Charlottesville who were not directly connected with the Virginia printing trade and who were not to consider publications produced for the Society. The estimable quality of those judges further points to the fertile ground from which the Society arose. For the first competition they included John Canaday, formerly an art professor at the University and later the art critic of the New York Times ; Harry Clemons, the University's librarian emeritus; Dan Healey, Charlottesville public librarian; and Charlotte Kohler, editor of the Virginia Quarterly Review . Miss Kohler stayed on the panel a second year, to be joined by William B. O'Neal, curator of the University's Museum of Fine Arts, and Charlottesville architect W. E. Stainback. Another architect, Dale Hamilton, judged in the final year, along with two people who, like O'Neal, at one point served on the Society's Council: Eleanor Shea, Consultant in Prints to Alderman Library, and Charles W. Smith, Chairman of the school's Department of Fine Arts. Press releases announcing the winners proudly noted their geographical distribution throughout Virginia, though the bulk of them clustered in the printing capital of the state, Richmond. Twenty-two firms won prizes in the three years the Society sponsored the contest, with Whittet &amp; Shepperson of Richmond garnering the most-- nine. The William Byrd Press, also of Richmond, brought in eight (including for the Rosenbach catalog West of the Alleghenies ); that this press published most of the early volumes of Studies in Bibliography pointed not to favoritism on the part of the judges but to the quality to which the Society had devoted itself. (Willis Shell of the Byrd press, who oversaw the production of Studies there, also won twice for productions of his private Attic Press.) Five-time winners included the Journalism Laboratory Press at Washington and Lee University; Stone Printing and Manufacturing Co. of Roanoke, from whose proprietor had earlier come to the University of Virginia an impressive collection of books illustrating the history of printing; and the Everett Waddey Company of Richmond. The University of Virginia Press, with whom the Society also issued many publications, won four times. The winning entries were variously displayed at the Printers' Association convention and at the State Library, and they were also made available to schools and libraries requesting them. Though the connection between the Society and the Association was by all indications cordial (the relationship included the Society's hosting of a coffee in Alderman Library for a regional meeting of the Society on 5 December 1953), the Society's sponsorship may have become a victim of the unmanageable deluge of interest it had provoked. In the fourth year of the Association's existence it took over the award itself, appropriately renamed for past- president Dietz, who had just died. For that competition it received 465 entries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The most visible manifestation of the new Society's existence, and the one that ultimately would not only characterize the organization most widely but also serve as its greatest contribution, was its publications program. The following articles in this volume--the full list of those productions, the history of Studies in Bibliography in particular, and the author index to the first fifty volumes of Studies --reflect the relative importance of this aspect of Society life. In its first half century the Society was to produce not only 50 volumes of SB (and reprints of 20 of them) but also about 175 other publications, in addition to 53 issues of its Secretary's News Sheet . Though this publishing program was not fully envisioned at the Society's foundation, this activity and the concerns it represented quickly developed, as was noted by a description of the Society in a 1966 Bibliography catalog from the University Press of Virginia: The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia was founded in 1947 as a small group of persons interested in diverse areas of book collecting and the techniques of bibliographical analysis. The latter of the two interests became dominant very early in the Society's thinking, and in 1948 the Society embarked upon its career as a publishing body with the appearance of Volume I of its annual Studies , under the editorship of Fredson Bowers. The series, which has continued under the same editorship, attracted immediate attention. An early reviewer said that the annual volume "from its inception took its place in the front rank of Bibliographical publication," and readers have continued to praise it for the interest and importance of its contributions. As striking as the publications program was to become, it was nonetheless the natural outgrowth of the original circumstances of the Society. The earliest publications rose from the same need to establish a corporate identity that had prompted the Society to hold public meetings. Some method of ongoing communication was called for among those whose interests had caused them to associate, particularly for members outside of Charlottesville, and within a month of the February 1947 start Wyllie issued the first number of the Secretary's News Sheet . Even this came not ex nihilo, for Wyllie had as models the News Sheets issued by the secretaries of the Bibliographical Society in London (1894-1920) and of the Bibliographical Society of America (1926-1951). Wyllie's initiative in fact closely paralleled that of the early secretary of the London society, A. W. Pollard, who (according to F. C. Francis in his account of that group on its own fiftieth anniversary) undertook as one of his "first actions" the "establishment of the Bibliographical Society's News Sheet , designed in the first place as a substitute for the postcards on which Notices of Meetings had hitherto been sent out." The Virginia society, furthermore, had itself used postcards to announce meetings, though it continued to do so for another forty years. (Among other similarities not readily apparent between the two groups are that each has been tightly entwined with a single library and that the archives of both are sadly deficient.) The Secretary's News Sheet ran for 53 issues, from March 1947 to December 1967, with the Council confirming reality by voting to discontinue the series on 21 March 1969. All except the final half dozen were by Wyllie, whose role as Secretary passed to William Runge in 1962. Their frequency varied, but they tended to come out about quarterly (though dated by month of issue). The first twenty-nine were on 82" x 11" paper--the first twenty-five numbers mimeographed on one side of one to ten leaves, then the next four photo-offset double-sided with a heading set in Warren Chappell's ubiquitous Lydian display type. The contents themselves of all News Sheet s except numbers 43 and 50 were typewritten. A further variation occurred in one of the first twenty-five: no heading had been included for SNS 15, and all copies had to be hand-stamped with the name, issue number, and date. From issue 30 (February 1954) the shape became squarish, about 6 3/4" high by 4 3/4" wide, but within that framework experiments in form continued. The typeset headings for 31-33 were printed in red; 31-33 and 35 were on coated paper; and with number 36 Lydian returned (except, again, for 50). Three cents of postage carried the copies to members--through 1952 in printed envelopes from Alderman Library, but after that bearing the stamped return address of the Society. The News Sheet s first of all communicated Society business: announcements of meetings, exhibitions, publications, reviews (that of SB 4 in the Stockholm journal Bokvännen clearly pleased the Secretary), contests and winners, gifts, and amendments to the constitution; annual financial statements; and, too soon, a necrology. News from members was welcome (including word that one was running for Governor of Virginia, or another's recommendation of a researcher in London, "six shillings an hour, funds to be deposited with her in advance"), and often copies of their publications were offered for distribution through the Society. Reflecting the embeddedness of the Society in Alderman Library, the News Sheet listed talks of other organizations that were to be given in the McGregor Room. The most scholarly purpose the early newsletters served was to print bibliographical notes and queries. They presented and solicited corrections for a draft of Rollo Silver's list of the first presses in each of the United States, for instance; they entertained modifications and additional locations for Coolie Verner's Society publication A Further Checklist of the Separate Editions of Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, with contributions by such people as Lawrence Wroth, Frederick Goff, and Thomas W. Streeter; and they provided additions and corrections to standard reference works, especially the Pollard and Redgrave STC, Wing's STC, and Evans's American Bibliography . Because not every issue of the News Sheet needed to include reports of official Society affairs, entire numbers eventually were devoted to bibliographical checklists, ones ineligible for publication either as monographs because of their brevity or as SB articles because the journal generally eschewed enumerative listings. SNS 34 foreshadowed that development: this October 1955 number included a record of recent work on Joyce, but for the first time it had a separate cover (a drawing of Joyce by John Canaday). From 1958 through the final number in 1967 ( SNS 39-53) most of the News Sheet s could stand as independent publications (and were sold as such). These included checklists of works by or about Roger Duvoisin (39), John Davidson (40), Joyce (42, with additions in 48), Jefferson as architect (43), Eudora Welty (45), Andrew Lytle (46), and Charles Smith (50). The series concluded with two further supplements to Evans's American Bibliography . The Secretary's News Sheet s also formed a natural bridge between the Society's meetings and its wider publications program. With the first number was enclosed the handout Fredson Bowers had distributed the previous month at the inaugural gathering (item 1947.1 in the following checklist; his talk itself, on bibliographical description, was summarized in that first SNS ). The logical next step was to publish the full text of talks, as the Society began doing with Charlton Hinman's presentation that spring (1947.2) and with those of Earl K. Fischer and C. William Miller (1948.1, 2) the following academic session (and as Wyllie was doing simultaneously with papers delivered at the McGregor Room Seminars in Contemporary Prose and Poetry). But if these mimeographed publications had more than ephemeral significance, they deserved more permanent form than as stapled sheets. Accordingly, starting in 1949, new publications were enclosed in stiff-paper covers (usually tan, except, in the case of a checklist of writings about R. E. Lee [1951.3], appropriately gray, and blue for a straggler in the series [1958.2]). But then there seemed no reason to limit these productions to Society talks; already in 1947 Wyllie and Barbara Harris had produced a transcription of nineteenth-century copyright entries in Norfolk, and more scholarship that had not been first presented orally followed in 1949. The initial contributions came from the local circle: listings by Bowers ( A Supplement to the Woodward &amp; McManaway Check List of English Plays 1641- 1700 ), Miller ( Henry Herringman Imprints: A Preliminary Checklist ), and Wyllie ( Preliminary Finding List of Writings on the Kentucky Book Trade , which he prepared for the Bibliographical Society of America as "Chairman for Southeastern States" of its Committee on Nineteenth-Century Publishers). But the range of authors immediately expanded: among the 1950 offerings was the first of the Society's important indexes to national bibliographies, the Index of Printers, Publishers and Booksellers in Pollard and Redgrave's Short-Title Catalogue by Paul Morrison, Curator of Rare Books at the University of Chicago. (Bowers arranged for the Index when he began summer teaching at Chicago in 1949.) The Society likewise began to publish talks that had been given in places other than Charlottesville: by Madeleine Stern at the Oneida, N.Y., Historical Society (1951.4), and by Helene Maxwell Hooker and Herman E. Spivey at the 1951 English Institute (1952.3, 9). Except for Morrison's Index , which had been lithographed, these publications were all mimeographed, on 82" x 11" paper. Except for one item announced in 1953 but not published until 1958 (1958.2), mimeographing ended in 1953, the same year the Society produced its first hardcover books. Those books in boards grew out of what the young Society was already accomplishing. Richard Harwell's Cornerstones of Confederate Collecting (1953.2) was a revised edition of the mimeographed version issued the previous year (1952.2). Roger Bristol's Maryland Imprints 1801- 1810 (1953.1) complemented mimeographed checklists of early Tennessee and Lexington, Kentucky, publishing. Both books were manufactured by the University of Virginia Press, and they bore some of the first public acknowledgements (except for SB 4 and for the 1952 exhibition catalogue of Mrs. Roy Arthur Hunt's botanical books, the Society's first typeset publication other than Studies ) of what would become a crucial link between the Press and the Society. Walter Harding's list of Walden editions (1954.3) and Mary E. Knapp's checklist of verse by David Garrick (1955.2) followed as hardcover editions in succeeding years, but the book whose presentation particularly suggested the Society was taking its publications seriously was another by Morrison, his Index of Printers, Publishers, and Booksellers in Donald Wing's Short- Title Catalogue . . . (1955.3). Advertising fliers reproduced the two-color title page of this large-format book, and the colophon recorded the name even of the person who laid and locked up the forms. The reception was appropriately welcoming. Writing in College and Research Libraries in October 1955, Allen Hazen captured as well the way in which major scholarly advances quickly become assumed as part of the normal intellectual landscape: To his constantly useful Index to the Pollard-Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue . . . Dr. Morrison has now added a similar Index to the 80,000 entries in Wing. One could wish to revive a useful old word to praise such "indicular" devotion: countless hours of patient listing have produced a tool that younger scholars will soon be taking for granted. But the tool here provided will assuredly continue for a few years to seem to older workers almost miraculous in the ease with which it now makes possible any search for books of a known printer or bookseller. . . . As the Society began to produce books in print runs larger than the needs of its own membership, it encountered the need to advertise. Accordingly, announcement of Society publications appeared in places such as Amateur Book Collector , American Book Prices Current , Antiquarian Bookman , College and Research Libraries , and the Wilson Library Bulletin Cusually in conjunction with other books from the library or the University Press. The following year saw another major project, the more than two thousand pages in five volumes of Robert Turnbull's Bibliography of South Carolina 1563-1950 . (An index volume followed in 1960.) Not only was the preparation of this work a large task; it was also especially convoluted. The book was produced "as an uncorrected typist's copy posthumously made from an author's uncompleted handwritten manuscript"; the typing, "not originally intended for photographic use," had been from dictation by the late author's wife, who had shipped the resulting cards to the Society only four weeks before her own death. Despite the Society's acknowledgement that the work was only provisional, it too was greeted with wide applause (a writer in the October 1956 Yale Alumni Magazine called it "monumental" and "remarkable"), and as a whole it has not yet been superseded. Amid continuing publication of paperbound books over the next few years, more items in hardcover also appeared. Notable among these were a two- volume bibliography of James Branch Cabell (1957.4; a volume each by Frances Joan Brewer and Matthew Bruccoli) and Frances Sharf Fink's Heads Across the Sea: An Album of Eighteenth-Century English Literary Portraits in America (1959.1). By far the most lavish, however, was the first in what would be a series completed in 1996 of eight Shakespearean prompt books from the seventeenth century, all edited by G. Blakemore Evans. The book consisted of two fascicles in stiff paper wrappers, the first consisting of editorial text, printed by letterpress, and the second a facsimile of the annotated seventeenth-century edition, which the Meriden Gravure Company reproduced by collotype. These were gathered in a portfolio, which itself was stored within a 13"-high slipcase. The Antiquarian Bookman of 8 August 1960 called the volume "a magnificent example of bookmaking and the book arts," and James McManaway, writing in the Autumn 1964 issue of Shakespeare Quarterly , identified the series as "one of the very important contributions of new material in Shakespearian studies and English theatrical history." As the physical and scholarly quality of its publications rose, the Society was faced with the question of whether to continue offering work which proclaimed itself "preliminary." A related but separate question was how to keep its publications affordable. The earliest forms, the mimeographed items, accomplished both goals. Not that these were without scholarly value; as Johan Gerritsen pointed out in English Studies in August 1956, "Among the many bibliographical benefits which the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia has in recent years bestowed upon the world of scholarship must also be numbered a series of mimeographed publications on special subjects." But as the range of items issued by the Society expanded, their appellation changed from what they were ("the mimeographed series") to that from which they were differentiated ("near-print publications," a description used as early as 1952). The need for a less formal method of publication survived the demise of the Society's use of mimeography in 1953, and in 1954 several new forms were introduced. The first was that of small- format books, slightly less than 7" x 5", unbound except for staples through the face of the book block near the spine. Four of these appeared (1954.1, 1954.5, 1955.1, 1957.1); the last was simultaneously available in a permanent casing which, except for its paper spine label, was the form in which five more publications of this size were issued (1958.1, 1958.3, 1959.2, 1960.4, 1960.6). (The same binding was used in those years for Barrett Library checklists of American literature.) Another change in 1954 was the issuance in two forms of the books that were slightly larger (about 9" x 6"). To ameliorate the cost of the Society's increasingly ambitious publications, members were sent unbound copies without charge, usually in advance of publication of the hardcover version (which they could then buy, at the price announced to the public). Five of these appeared, covering editions of Walden (1954.3), Garrick's verse (1955.2), Jefferson's books on the fine arts (1956.1), Thoreau's library (1957.2), and James Branch Cabell's writings (vol. 2 of 1957.4). All the unbound titles except the Jefferson one were stapled through the front; all except the Walden bibliography were on paper of the same quality as the hardbound issue. Whereas those sets of paperbound items originating in 1954 seemed to beg for permanent bindings, the books in a third group that began to appear then (but adumbrated by the Hunt exhibition catalog in 1952) gave the impression that they had reached their intended appearance. Though also paperbound and stapled (but on the spine), the outside of these small-format publications was a two-leaf fold wrapped around the other leaves, with the front as the title page. (Paper copies in the other groups had a half-title or a blank on the front.) That first year only a sole example appeared, Joseph Graves's account of Victor Hammer (1954.2), but the pattern would find expression in the 1955 number of the Secretary's News Sheet (34) that was issued with a cover and in the nine issues of SNS from 1958 through 1967 that were devoted to a single subject. This design began appearing repeatedly in the regular publications program in 1962, though with a slight variation: the three items issued that year (1962.3, 4, 5; each had wrappers larger than the text leaves) and in the two subsequent (1966.4, 1967.6) all were unfastened inside their covering. (Harkening back to earlier terminology, the catalog of James Monroe's library [1967.6] characterized itself as "The issuing in near-print of a manuscript designed ultimately for book form. . . .") They shared that feature with most of the special Secretary's News Sheet s, though the two News Sheet s at the end of the run in 1966 and 1967 were stapled on the spine, as was one of the non- SNS items (1967.13). Frontal stapling showed up in this series (as 1966.2 and 1967.5), but unlike earlier examples these items with multiple gatherings now had their first leaf as title page instead of a half-title or blank. In their appearance, the "Technical Reports" that the Society introduced in 1967 were an obvious continuation of earlier publications: photo- offset, small format, wrappers with title on front, and stapling on the spine. They tended to be longer than their predecessors (the thickest, the catalog of Ellen Glasgow's library [1969.5], came to 309 pages), but what they particularly added was a new explicitness about the affordability and special nature of the items. One of the first, a bibliography of the Colombian poet José Eusebio Caro (1967.1), pointed out that these reports were available to members "at nominal prices, ranging from $.50 to $5.00, depending on the cost of production. [&amp;] They are considered as being either preliminary and advance forms of manuscript preparation, or of such specialized interest as not yet to support letterpress publication." As such they filled the same function that some people find met today by the Internet. From 1967 through 1970 eleven of the Reports were published--seven being indexes to the figurative imagery of Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists by Louis Charles Stagg. With the termination of the Technical Reports, the Society by and large refrained from issuing material in subordinate forms for about two decades. One situation that did call for special attention, however, was the intermittent need to reproduce articles from Studies in Bibliography . This happened only a few times and was initiated by the University Press of Virginia, which in 1965 republished G. Thomas Tanselle's The Historiography of American Literary Publishing for its own promotional purposes. In 1967 the Society itself reprinted Franklin B. Williams's Photo-Facsimiles of STC Books and in subsequent years three more essays by Tanselle: one for a customer's erroneous order (1968.5), one for the U.S. Copyright Office (1969.4), and one, on the editing of historical documents, for general circulation (1978.4). Special occasion to offer SB articles in separate form arose in 1993 for Tanselle's biography of Fredson Bowers and the accompanying list of Bowers's writings by Martin Battestin. Accordingly, the Society established a series of "Occasional Publications," intended for the reprinting of articles that deserved wider distribution and for works of less than monograph size. The Bowers book (1993.3) was the first, followed immediately by another article from the same volume of Studies about books for which Samuel Johnson subscribed (1993.2), and then by an edition of Johnson's translation of Sallust (1993.4). Although all these publications divided into various subsets according to their form, in their subject matter they fit coherently into the Society's larger publishing program. Not surprisingly, checklists of primary or secondary materials or full-fledged descriptive bibliographies appeared more often than any other kind of book, and editions, especially of literary works, were also relatively frequent. The other major category of Society publications fit naturally with these: writings about bibliography and editing, and about the book trade more widely. Individual publications are not always neatly assignable according to genre, but overall the Society produced about thirty author bibliographies and a further eighteen or so listings of other primary sources. Lists of secondary materials about authors and subjects were slightly fewer, about three dozen in all. Bibliographical description as a concern of the Society and the standards that could be achieved were manifest from the very start in the form of Bowers's handout on Wolfert's Roost (1947.1). But despite the publication (elsewhere) of Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description in 1949, his model was slow to take effect; the author of the checklist of Walden editions in 1954 specifically noted that "I have tried to keep bibliographical details to a minimum" (1954.3). Occasionally bibliographies included collation formulas (as in Bowyer's Junius, 1957.1) and samplings of variants (as in Bruccoli's Cabell, 1957.4b), but it was not until B. C. Bloomfield's bibliography of Auden in 1964 that the Society published full-fledged descriptions. A good number of useful checklists both for authors and subjects nonetheless emerged in those years, most of them appearing in the inexpensive series already noted. The authors here tended to be English and American literary ones, from Garrick to Maugham, Maxwell Anderson, and Welty, but they also included the political controversialist Junius, the French writer J. K. Huysmans, the architectural historian Fiske Kimball, and the Colombian poet Caro. The incarnation of later works of this kind in hardcover gave them additional dignity even as the range of coverage expanded: four such volumes, published after the Society issued its books through the University Press of Virginia, included bibliographies of Glasgow (1964.4; this one fit the earlier literary pattern); of George Abbot, a seventeenth-century archbishop of Canterbury (1966.1), and John Henry Newman (1978.1), these broadening the scope to religious writers; and of Arnold's letters (1968.1), which highlighted coverage of manuscript materials. Meanwhile the Society was also publishing checklists on other than single authors. Several of these covered genres: seventeenth-century English drama (1949.2, Bowers again proving an early model) and fiction (1952.4-6, reprinted as 1967.7), English prose fiction of the 1740s (1972.1), the Chilean novel (1961.2), and Virginia almanacs (1962.1). Still other lists fell into no convenient category: performance dates of D'Urfey's plays (1950.1), for instance; poetry occasioned by the death of Charles II (1958.1); and editions of the important eighteenth-century cartographical record of American waters, The English Pilot (1960.6). A further category of checklist- related items includes some of the most important books published by the Society. Already in the early years had come forth a broad variety of imprint lists--of Henry Herringman in the seventeenth century (1949.3), of the Derrydale Press in the twentieth (1951.2), and of Maryland (1953.1), Tennessee (1953.3), and Lexington, Kentucky (1953.4) from the time printing began there. But what proved of exceptional value were the collateral materials the Society provided for three existing national bibliographies-- Pollard and Redgrave's Short-Title Catalogue for English books up to 1640, Donald Wing's continuation for books to 1700, and Charles Evans's American Bibliography for American books through the eighteenth century. The first contributions have already been noted: Paul Morrison's 1950 Index of Printers, Publishers and Booksellers in the STC and his similar index to Wing in 1955. The Society published two supplements to Wing by John Alden based on holdings in Ireland (1955.1) and the British Museum (1958.2), and, by agreement with the Wing Revision, also recorded addenda and corrigenda in Studies in Bibliography for several years (in volumes 29-31, 1976-78). In 1961 Roger Bristol, a University of Virginia librarian, produced the first of his auxiliary works for the Evans bibliography, his Index of Printers, Publishers, and Booksellers for names occurring there. His 1970 Supplement to Charles Evans' American Bibliography, published by the Society and the Bibliographical Society of America, and his Index to that Supplement the next year capped at least twenty years of his labors. Whatever limitations the original sources possessed affected all these progeny, but each of the new books enhanced its source by providing access not otherwise possible. It was with a memorial gift from the Massey family after the death of Linton Massey in 1974 that the Society began in earnest to publish descriptive bibliographies. Up to then it had brought forth only the ones for Auden (1964.1, with a second edition as 1972.2) and Ernst Toller (1968.4). Except for Donald Gallup's bibliography of Ezra Pound, which was published in 1983 with St. Paul's Bibliographies, subsequent books of this kind were to be known as "Linton R. Massey Descriptive Bibliographies" and financed from the Massey fund. Seven of them have appeared: by Joe Maynard and Barry Miles (with an introduction by Allen Ginsberg) on William S. Burroughs (1978.2), Candace W. MacMahon on Elizabeth Bishop (1980.4), James A. Grimshaw, Jr., on Robert Penn Warren (1981.1), Stuart Wright and James L. W. West III on Reynolds Price (1986.3), Wright on Randall Jarrell (1986.2) and Peter Taylor (1988.1), and Michael Boughn on H.D. (1993.1). By this time serious work in bibliographical description anywhere looked to the guiding influence of Bowers (as the Wright and Boughn books acknowledge), but the MacMahon and Grimshaw volumes also had the advantage of his personal attention. The bibliographies in this series were a fitting tribute to Massey in part because of their similarity to his own book published by the Society, "Man Working," his catalogue of the Faulkner collections at the University of Virginia (1968.3). It was not a descriptive bibliography, but because even now none exists for the works of Faulkner, the thoroughness of his account has insured its continuing value for many of the reasons that full bibliographies are consulted. One unexpected contribution of these bibliographies of modern authors is that many of them provide prefaces in which their subjects reflect on what it is that such works accomplish (and by which they also guarantee that the following account of their works is incomplete). Though not all of these writers seem to have read Bowers on the purposes of descriptive bibliography, they do offer reminders of the social context of the bibliographies themselves and of what is at stake in human terms. Elizabeth Bishop states concisely the theme common to all the commentators: Upon being "bibliographed," as Edmund Wilson put it, I find I am suffering from "mixty motions," as a student's paper put that . The image Robert Penn Warren chooses seems intended to portray his own perturbation rather than to comment on the book he is prefacing, but either way it is sobering: The bibliography puts you in your place. Your face looks up, but as in a coffin, a very fine coffin. To regard it inspires humility. . . . You are confronted with big chunks of your life process, and you are likely to be panicked into the question: Was this my life? W. H. Auden invokes similar imagery: I have always enjoyed reading bibliographies as I enjoy reading railroad timetables, recipes, or, indeed, any kind of list. To be confronted with one's own, however, is a terrifying experience. For me, Mr. Bloomfield is not just a scholar; he is the Recording Angel who has set down in black and white exactly what I have done. In his introduction to the bibliography of his friend William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg begins with more overt deprecation but ends, as the others do, with a recognition of potential good in this form of scholarship: Who has the time to read such big bibliographies? Certainly such readers are very specialized creatures in midwestern libraries appreciatively washing their hands and smoking a little hash before opening up these dreadful tomes. On the other hand, there are young lads and lasses all over the century whose brains have been influenced by Burrough's implacable egolessness or deathly wit as 'twas said in the presence of Tibetan lamas. . . . I hope this book serves as a guide map for myself and others to locate his landmarks and side trips, interzones and galaxies--where we'll find him lurking waiting for us with benevolent indifferent attentiveness, "last of the Faustian men," as Kerouac mythologized him in an earlier decade this century. And though Reynolds Price implies that bibliographers are among the stereotypical enemies of artistic creativity, he singles them out for commendation: Bankrollers, printers, biographers (there your writer must be dead), textual detectives, the immensely rare good critic, the bibliographer--even a curmudgeon is secretly grateful to them all. But the single necessity is the bibliographer. Without his meticulous hunt, his public list, no really adequate response to a prolific writer can hope to begin. Linton Massey's death also prompted another publication, a facsimile of the Virginia copy of Faulkner's play The Marionettes . Designating the book as "A Linton R. Massey Memorial Publication," the Society published it in two editions: a sumptuous version of unopened and unbound sheets in a portfolio and slipcase, limited to 126 numbered or lettered copies (1975.3), and a trade edition, which included an introduction and textual apparatus by Noel Polk (1977.1). These were two of the fourteen facsimile editions the Society has produced, eight of them in the series of Shakespearean prompt books from 1960 to 1996. Two of the others, Poe mementoes for the Society's twenty-fifth anniversary (1971.2) and a poem by Pound (1984.2), were in the nature of keepsakes, but the final two, like the Faulkner and the Shakespeare, were serious scholarly works--a facsimile of a copy of Pope's Dunciad into which a friend of Pope had copied readings from the manuscript (1991.1), and an edition of Johnson's previously unpublished translation of Sallust (1993.4). The first of those was marked by an extensive bibliographical apparatus; the second, by a new method of recording manuscript alterations. Earlier the Society had commemorated the death of John Wyllie in a similar way. From the proceeds of a solicitation led by Matthew Bruccoli it produced two "John Cook Wyllie Memorial Publications": an edition of The Notebook of Stephen Crane , edited by Donald J. and Ellen B. Greiner (1969.2), and Edgar Allan Poe: A Bibliography of Criticism 1827-1972 , by J. Lasley Dameron and Irby B. Cauthen, Jr. (1974.1). The Crane notebook was part of a larger grouping of scholarly editions that over the history of the Society had included Goldsmith's "Prospect of Society," edited by William B. Todd (1956.2); Hawthorne's poems, by Richard E. Peck (1967.3); the notesheets (1972.3) and early drafts (1977.2) of Joyce's Ulysses , by Phillip F. Herring; George Eliot's notebook, by Joseph Weisenfarth (1981.2); Frost's stories for his daughter Lesley, by Roger D. Sell (1984.1); Longfellow's John Endicott , by Edward L. Tucker (1985.2); and Thoreau's A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers , by Linck C. Johnson (1986.1). It is interesting that although the ideas of Fredson Bowers had formed the basis for the seals granted to editions by committees of the Modern Language Association of America, the nature of these Society books entailed that only one, the Thoreau, was eligible for their mark of approval (it received the award from the Center for Scholarly Editions). While Dameron and Cauthen's bibliography of Poe criticism was special in paying tribute to Wyllie, it was also part of the Society's ongoing attempt to trace the responses of readers by listing their printed reactions. Although enumerations of criticism never became a chief form of Society publication, a fair number of these did appear, usually on literary subjects. Some were in the paperbound publications-- lists of Master's theses on Spenser (1950.4) and Wordsworth (1962.4), and an earlier version of Dameron's Poe list (1966.2). Sometimes they arose as adjuncts to descriptive bibliographies, as in the accounts for Auden, Toller, and (in the Massey series) Bishop, Warren, and H.D. But a number of full books were devoted to these as well: on Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburh (1969.3), Valéry (1970.1), Austen (1973.2, 1985.1), Carlyle (1976.2), and Carroll (1980.2, in conjunction with the Lewis Carroll Society of North America). The same patterns obtained for writings on other than specific literary authors, beginning already in the mimeograph days (with checklists of appearances of the "American hero" [1950.2] and of books about Robert E. Lee [1951.3]). Beginning in 1954 the Society also co-published four books (in the series Bonner Beiträge zur Bibliotheks- und Bücherkunde) that listed German contributions to the study of non-German writing: doctoral dissertations on English and American (1954.4), romance (1958.4), and Scandinavian language and literature (1959.3), and German translations of American belles lettres (1961.5). In addition, the Society published John M. Spalek's massive guide to archives of Germans who emigrated to the United States after the rise of National Socialism (1978.3). Though books such as the Austen checklists quickly brought needed revenue and performed a useful scholarly service, the chief concerns of this bibliographical society were not in principle literary, and publications on the order of its two cumulated checklists of bibliographical scholarship (1957.3 and 1966.5; these had first appeared in Studies ) or its list of published facsimiles of early music printing (1962.5) were more in accord with its original purposes. The study of collecting and collections also came closer to those interests--and indeed honored the concerns both of those who established the Society for bibliophilic reasons and of those who had more specific scholarly purposes in mind. Several of the early mimeographed papers were on collecting: on the Sadleir-Black assemblage of gothic novels (1949.1), on confederate imprints (1952.2), and on southern fiction (1952.7). A surprising number of publications itemized the contents of important libraries--those of literary figures Thoreau (1957.2), Faulkner (1964.2), Emerson (1967.2), Glasgow (1967.13), and, most dramatically, Fielding (1996.2); of American presidents Jefferson (1956.1, covering his fine arts library; the keepsake 1952.10 also provided Jefferson's recommendations for a basic gentleman's library) and Monroe (1967.6); and of the early nineteenth-century president of the Bank of the United States (1950.6; the paper was first presented as a talk to the Society by the Virginia professor, David McCord Wright, who had re-collected these items). Books by Linton Massey (1968.3) and by Robert W. Hamblin and Louis Daniel Brodsky (1979.1) were accounts of collections, as were in their own ways the exhibition checklists for the Hunt botanical books (1952.1) and the Grolier Club's W. S. Gilbert display (1963.1). The uses made of collections was also a concern: Paul Kaufman's Borrowings from the Bristol Library 1773-1784 (1960.4) presaged the more recent fascination with the study of such records. Also in harmony with the constitutional goals of the Society were the publications it sponsored about bibliography, textual study, and book trade history. Actual bibliographies and editions themselves constituted a form of commentary (and often contained explicit discussions as well), but separate reflections on these subjects were also present--from the first official meeting, in fact, when Bowers talked about the description of modern books. In the title of the other Society talk of early 1947, Charlton Hinman asked one of the most incisive questions in either bibliography or textual criticism as he pondered the scholarly significance of having seventy-nine first-folio editions of Shakespeare's works available in a single library, the Folger (1947.2). Discussions specifically of textual matters were also present from early on: Edwin Wolf 2nd talked about the textual importance of manuscript commonplace books from the seventeenth century (1949.4), and two papers published by the Society on behalf of the English Institute addressed the need for organized records of literary manuscripts (with the goal of preparing standard editions of American authors) and the value of non- literary (here, "historical") papers for literary students (1952.9, 1952.3). Hardcover books devoted to textual questions dealt with the composition history of novels by Faulkner (1975.2), D. H. Lawrence (1979.3), and, pictorially, Dreiser (1985.3) as well as transmission of motifs in Aesop (1979.2) and the grammar of substantives in Shakespeare (1976.1). But by far the most important discussion of bibliographical and textual matters in separate publications of the Society occurred in books by Bowers and Tanselle. A collection of Bowers's essays ( Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing ) appeared shortly after his retirement from the University (1975.1); summaries of his ideas also pervade Tanselle's biography of him (1993.3). Tanselle's essay on the editing of historical documents was reprinted from SB (as 1978.4) and had wide influence in that editing community. The activity of the Society's monograph publications program and of its journal overlapped in three volumes of Tanselle's articles that it has published: Selected Studies in Bibliography (1979.4), Textual Criticism since Greg: A Chronicle (1987.1; both of those works collect essays that first appeared in SB ), and Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing (1990.1; this one contains material from SB as well as from other sources). The Society also published a variety of books dealing with printing history and the book trade; these, too, emerged in the earliest days of the Society. One of its very first productions was a documentary record, the list of nineteenth- century copyright entries for the Eastern District of Virginia (1947.3). That item, chiefly the responsibility of Wyllie, was soon followed by a list of writings on the Kentucky book trade (1949.5) that he had compiled as regional chairman of the Bibliographical Society of America's "Committee on 19th Century Publishers." In line with the checklists of imprints and the personnel indexes to national bibliographies considered earlier, the Society published A Directory of the Book Trade in Greenfield, Massachusetts, 1792-1899 (1954.1); other works explored the role of printing in fifteenth-century England (1967.4) and, as a festschrift, books ". . . in America's Past " (1966.6). A number of publications dealt with important individuals: Valentine Simmes (1968.2), Ralph Crane (1972.4), and Henry Herringman (1948.2) in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England; William Williams in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Utica, New York (1951.4); Samuel Snowden in nineteenth-century Virginia (1952.8, 1954.5); and Victor Hammer in nineteenth-century Vienna and subsequently much of the rest of the world (1954.2). In addition, the Society issued an expanded form of D. F. McKenzie's SB listing of Stationers' Company apprentices as the first volume in his important series of such accounts (1961.3). Finally, the Society published a group of works on the processes and materials of printing. A couple of these were paperbound: an account of printing inks (1948.1), and a Technical Report reprinting advertising cuts from the eighteenth-century Virginia Gazette (1969.1). The others were more substantial: Richard E. Huss's The Development of Printers' Mechanical Typesetting Methods, 1822-1925 (1973.1), and Rollo Silver's classics, Typefounding in America, 1787- 1825 (1965.2) and The American Printer, 1787-1825 (1967.8). Overall, then, the Society's publications became characterized by their range and by their affordability. Many carried prefatory notes of thanks to Society officers not only for help in the course of production but also for suggestions that had generated the items in the first place. Frequently the books reflected the particular interests of the same officers. The ones on American imprints, for instance, fit well with Wyllie's former role as an editor of the Virginia Imprint Series, just as the items on South American literature accorded with his facility in Spanish (he had grown up in Santo Domingo). One of the especially interesting features of many of the books is what would now be called their "interactive" quality; they were often explicitly recognized as stages of an ongoing discovery. That activity was possible most readily when the Society conducted its Secretary's News Sheet , for here it could solicit and report updates on its own publications--Bristol's Maryland Imprints , for instance, or Verner's record of Jefferson's Notes on Virginia . The most vivid example of such building is undoubtedly the work that led to Bristol's Supplement to Evans . New "Evans Addenda" in seven issues of the News Sheet contributed to a large "checking edition" issued in twenty-three 32-page fascicles from 1962 through 1964 and then collected in 1965; responses to these appeared in the final two numbers of the News Sheet in 1966 and 1967, and then all the new materials were gathered in 1970. The Society's publications also interacted with themselves in other ways. The second part of Mish's English Prose Fiction cited its indebtedness to an article in SB 2; the republication of Morrison's index to the STC was made from Wyllie's annotated copy of the original (with a new note emphasizing that modifications were "Still welcome"); and the second edition of the Auden bibliography announced that the University Press would act as the ongoing agent for corrections and additions. Such ongoing interest for their offspring is not inevitable among publishers or authors, and it represented another way in which the Society attempted to be of special service to its field. The ongoing adjustments in the physical form of the Society's publications entered a significant new phase in 1996 when the Society established a site on the World Wide Web. With that home page came two electronic publications: a searchable index of authors and titles from the first forty- nine volumes of Studies in Bibliography (1996.3), and the complete and searchable contents of volume 7 of Studies (1996.4). The latter was the prototype for what will be made available early in 1997: the complete backfile of forty-nine volumes of SB , all encoded to be searchable electronically (1997.3). As such, Studies will be the first scholarly journal to make its full retrospective file available electronically without charge. The publications of 1996 also show the Society's flexibility in choosing the method of textual reproduction most appropriate to the circumstances. In that year it produced not only these electronic publications distributed on the World Wide Web but also a book set by computer and printed by xerography as well as one set by linotype and printed by letterpress. Although the SB volumes from nearly a half century were newly keyboarded for the electronic project by a commercial firm, the tagging with computer codes was performed by the staff of the University Library's Electronic Text Center, which also mounted the files on the Internet. This Center, which has become an international leader in the presentation of electronic materials, maintains a particular advantage in that its director David Seaman and many on his staff are experienced in bibliography and textual criticism and thus have special insight into the texts they are dealing with. That expertise has also come into play for two other electronic publications to be made at the same time as the full SB : searchable page facsimiles of G. Blakemore Evans's complete series of seventeenth-century Shakespearean prompt books (1997.2), and a combined and searchable edition of the six installments of Emily Lorraine de Montluzin's attributions of authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine (1997.1) that had earlier appeared in Studies . The cooperation involved in these electronic projects is a new form of the oldest collaboration in which the Society has engaged--with the University Library. Though that connection was strongest at the beginning, when the Society almost appeared to be an agency of the Library, in some form or other it has always been maintained. Harry Clemons, who was Librarian at the Society's inception, instantly recognized the benefits the Society brought the library. On 12 October 1949 he wrote Massey that he "deemed it fortunate for this Library that it could serve as headquarters," and he noted that the Society had "brought to the Library interesting speakers and interested audiences." Even today, four members of the Society's Council are from the library staff. But particularly for the Society's publications, as for the various joint meetings noted earlier, the group has also entered into partnerships with a number of other organizations, among them the English Institute (1952.3, 9), H. Bouvier u. Co. in Bonn (1954.4, 1958.4, 1959.3, 1961.5), the Thoreau Society (1957.2), the American Association of Architectural Bibliographers and the Society of Architectural Historians (1959.2), Ediciones de Andrea of Mexico City (1961.2), the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library (1967.6), Southeast Missouri State University (1979.1), the Lewis Carroll Society of North America (1980.2), St. Paul's Bibliographies (1983.1), the New York Public Library (1991.1), and the Johnsonians (1993.4). By far the most important relationship for publications, however, has been with the official printing and publishing arms of the University itself. The blurry distinctions between University Library and Bibliographical Society extended to these other relationships as well; the positive result was that, with the Society and its leaders operating at the center of this activity, the name of the University early in the Society's life assumed the connotation it would long hold as a place associated with the serious study and production of books. Already on 30 May 1953 the Antiquarian Bookman wrote that "It is a dull month when the University of Virginia, in all its branches, does not contribute something useful for bookmen." The "three particularly pleasant items" it noted for the current month were two Society publications, Bristol's Maryland Imprints and Mitchell's Preliminary Checklist of Tennessee Imprints , and a book from one of the other "branches," a pamphlet of Increase Mather published for the McGregor Library--that is, one in a series of editions from the McGregor collection published by Wyllie. All three were ostensibly published by still another division, the "University of Virginia Press." That unit, which Wyllie had reorganized at the behest of the University president in 1948, was at this time largely a printing service, though stimulated by Wyllie's interest in issuing books it had also developed into the rudiments of a publishing press. According to Chic Moran, who was the establishment's director for twenty years starting in 1954, the University allowed this Press considerable autonomy, thereby adding to its accessibility for the Society. It was at the Press that many of the Society's early publications (as well as SB volumes 4 and 9-30) were printed, and it was from the Press that its first hardcover books were issued. For some time people both inside the University and out (the latter included Julian Boyd, who had written a forceful proposal to that effect) had thought that a formal scholarly press was a necessary concomitant to UVa's aspirations as a research institution and to its perception as such. According to Edgar Shannon, who was then University President, "Fredson Bowers and some other distinguished faculty were having to go to be published at other places and to some extent what could be our own reputation was being bled off that way" (Shannon's remarks came in an interview reported in the Winter/Spring 1996 newsletter of the Press). Under the leadership of Shannon the University Press of Virginia was founded in October 1962. Its name was chosen to reflect its design to serve organizations throughout the state; the former University of Virginia Press, meanwhile, became known as the University of Virginia Printing Office. For a five-member committee to propose organizational guidelines for the new Press, Shannon drew on two stalwarts of the Bibliographical Society, Bowers and Wyllie. For the seven-member governing board that was subsequently established, the Society provided two others: William B. O'Neal and Arthur Stocker. The first director of the new Press, Victor Reynolds, arrived in April 1963. Working from an office in the Rotunda that contained "a table and two chairs and a telephone and some scratchpads and pencils" (according to Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., in the same 1996 interview for the Press's newsletter), Reynolds quickly had to establish a list of books. One approach to doing so found expression in a letter he wrote the Society on 11 April: "The Board of Directors of the University Press of Virginia has authorized me to tell you that the Press will consider it a privilege to take over the stock of books previously published by the Bibliographical Society of Virginia on the following terms." Indeed, of the seventy- five titles listed in the Press's first catalog that fall, thirty-two (six of them volumes of SB ) were Society publications. (Together, books from the Society and McGregor Library constituted 60% of the Press's first list.) Society publications also provided range, appearing in four categories (Art, Bibliography, History, and Literature) out of the seven in a related checklist of items being taken over from the former University of Virginia Press. Reynolds also discovered another advantage of collaborating with the Society. As the Society's Publications Committee chairman Arthur Stocker noted to fellow Councilor Anne Ehrenpreis on 5 October 1966, a certain bibliographical book "is in the hands of the Press, but Victor Reynolds habitually refers bibliographical matter to us, as a source of publication funds." As the Press became established and gradually obtained better quarters, it was better able to take physical control of the books it was offering for sale. Acquiring a warehouse meant consolidating the books that had been scattered around the University Grounds, though it turned out that the symbolism of the books' physical location could prove ambiguous. As a result, Wyllie wrote to the University auditor on 1 August 1967 to clarify ownership as well as to summarize the Society's arrangements with the Press: The Society's stock maintained by the University Press belongs to the Society, not the Press. They act as copy editors, designers, warehousers, and sales agent for us and for these services (not all used in all cases) we pay them percentages of proceeds varying from 25 to 50%. The Society, too, clearly benefited from the new arrangements. Physical consolidation of the volumes the Press was offering first of all meant that the Society could reduce the stock it was storing in the Rare Book Room. But the chief benefits lay elsewhere. As Massey explained in a letter of 14 August 1969 to Frederick Goff, President of the Bibliographical Society of America (about Bristol's forthcoming supplement to Evans's American Bibliography ), "Once the publication of a book has been authorized they [the Press] relieve us of all further concern." Though the Society still went through the vexatious process of having manuscripts evaluated and of superintending whatever revisions were necessary, the Press increasingly took care of production and, of particular importance, advertising and distribution. Shortly after the launching of the Press the Society published on its own a few remaining works that had been in the pipeline as well as some more Technical Reports, but in the late 1960s it also initiated a few last items for which it would have sole responsibility: Hawthorne's Poems (1967.3), the new edition of Mish's fiction checklist (1967.7), the book on Valentine Simmes (1968.2), and Stephen Crane's Notebook (1969.2). The latter, a memorial to Wyllie, unwittingly signaled that the Society would no longer be able to sustain an independent publishing program, for one of its workhorses was now gone. In a memorandum to the Council on 28 February 1969, Linton Massey explained the Society's situation: In the future we hope to concentrate our publishing activities by working closely with the University Press if only because they have a merchandising facility we do not possess. Our inventory of unsold books, published by us direct, is formidable; but we have a flyer in preparation as the first step in a campaign to reduce that inventory and liquidate our investment. Particularly on the minds--and hands--of the Council was the Wyllie memorial volume; as Massey wrote Matthew Bruccoli on 8 August 1969, "This book was produced through the University Printing Office, not the University Press; we are thus obliged to merchandise the volume ourselves. Wish us luck and a larger sale this autumn!" In volumes 23 through 25 (1970-72) of SB two publications lists appeared: for items available through the Press, and through the Society. The Society offerings were mostly the Technical Reports, but they included the four books; by the end of 1970, those hardcover publications had been transferred to the Press and the remaining Reports discarded. The identity and recognition that the Society books gave the Press from the start was strengthened as the Press began to handle publications for a number of other institutions of the book world. In a letter on 1 June 1972 to the Masseys abroad, Walker Cowen announced with glee that "I have concluded an agreement to distribute . . . the past publications of the Grolier Club." From its earliest days the Press had made available the productions of the Virginia Historical Society, the Virginia State Library, and the Tracy W. McGregor Library. The number of affiliated institutions grew, and the bookish ones among them came to include not only such major establishments as the American Antiquarian Society, the Bibliographical Society of America, the Folger Library, the Rosenbach Museum and Library, and St. Paul's Bibliographies, but also such organizations as the American Association of Architectural Bibliographers, the New York Historical Society, the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, the Columbia Historical Society, the Institute of Early American History and Culture, Colonial Williamsburg, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, Bryn Mawr College Library, and Prospect Books. (In an instance of multivalent cooperation, SB 32 in 1979 included a list of titles from the Bibliographical Society of America that were available from the Press.) Although the Press did not deal solely with bibliography, it quickly became the first source to check for new publications in that field. That status was reinforced by special "Bibliography" catalogs the Press issued in 1966 and 1974, two of only a dozen or so subject catalogs the Press has issued during its existence (and most of those later, in the 1990s), and by the covers of its biannual catalogs that were based on new Society publications such as Massey's Faulkner volume, the Society's Poe keepsakes from 1971, the Marionettes , or Frost's Stories for Lesley . Cowen himself had joined the Press under Victor Reynolds and succeeded him as director in 1969; in 1971 he also became a member of the Society's Council. To the Press's other strengths were added two excellent designers who often worked on projects of the Society: Edward Foss for the first decade and a half, and, from 1980, Janet Anderson. The death of Walker Cowen in 1987 kindled changes in the relationship of the Society and the Press. Early signs of a shift appeared as the Press ended its association with the organizations whose presence in its list had contributed to its reputation as a preeminent American press for publications dealing with the book world. A more direct complication arose when the Press accepted only grudgingly a book that the Society considered one of its more important contributions, a collection of G. Thomas Tanselle's essays entitled Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing . Reluctant to accept the judgment of the Society, the new Press director requested that "future projects be accompanied by an outside expert evaluation." Believing that "such collections do not make a new contribution to scholarship" and would lose money, the Press also required that the Society receive a smaller share than usual of the proceeds from the Tanselle book. (Sales later required that the book go into a second printing.) It was about this time that other complications also arose and that the Society began to think anew about resuming full responsibility for its publications program. An occasion to do so arose in the early 1990s. As a parting token to his friends, Fredson Bowers had on his death in 1991 left some money to the University's English Department in order that it could prepare for them an updated checklist of his writings. Martin Battestin's work on that list developed in conjunction with Tanselle's preparation of a biography of Bowers, and it seemed appropriate to apply the Bowers bequest to reprint together these accounts that first appeared in SB 46 (1993). The mechanics of doing so were quite straightforward (though the reissuing provided opportunities that had to be seized for slight revision and for the addition of an index), and with the new volume the Society not only began its series of "Occasional Publications" but also resumed publishing on its own. The second item in that series, a checklist of books to which Samuel Johnson subscribed, was reproduced from the same volume of Studies and held minimal challenges, but the third, an edition of Johnson's translation of Sallust, required more decisions about production. The Society's two 1996 productions in hardcover, the final volume of the Shakespearean prompt books and the account of Fielding's library, were likewise produced independently. It remains to be seen whether the Society will wish to proceed without the set of services the Press would otherwise provide, but in at least one regard the Press has become irrelevant, for the publishing the Society has begun on the Internet enables it to produce new kinds of works and to bring them to audiences more efficiently than with print. The Society's connection with the Press has not been severed, however; as a symbol of that continuing relationship, the Press continues to store and distribute the copies of Studies that remain after the Society has sent out the volumes to members. The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia (renamed Studies in Bibliography for volume 2), the journal that the Times Literary Supplement said "came forth to astonish all the bibliographers of Europe" (27 April 1966), was the Society's most hazardous publishing venture: publication in the form of a book was expensive, and there was no assurance of adequate sales to recover the cost of production. Such a project had been latent as far back as Wyllie's 1946 questionnaire that gauged interest in a society. About half the respondents--including Bowers--said they would like to see "an annual volume of studies." (Slightly more hoped for "Printed announcements of exhibits.") In a letter to Massey after the appearance of volume 1, Bowers pondered the future of Studies and summarized the attendant problems: To a certain extent as a Society we are suffering from growing pains and from something that I am in part responsible for, perhaps, which is a quick transition from a small group of interested people necessarily local in character, to an attempt to fasten to this small nucleus a national membership and go big time not by steady and progressive changes but in one or two big swoops. There is a penalty for this, which we are suffering, and this is the inevitable lag between what we can offer (and its cost to us) and the people who become conscious of this and take advantage of our offer. The gamble is, of course, that the public we ought ultimately to reach may not catch up to us in time before we go under. It might have been wise to start publishing on a more modest scale. I simply don't know. . . . If there is indeed such a vacuum [for such scholarship], then properly it should be filled as we tried with vol. 1, by a 200+ page volume, which is roughly equal to four issues of BSA. I think we can secure attention only with such a production, where a 100 page brochure would have caused a very slight ripple. (19 April 1949) As the local Daily Progress noted (on 15 January 1949), issuance of volume 1 did indeed mark formally "the growth into a national organization of what was originally a small group of people meeting occasionally in the McGregor Room of the Alderman Library to hear talks on books." From that point, Studies served symbolically as "monumental evidence" of the "work and worth" of the Society itself (according to Richard Shoemaker in Library Trends , January 1967). F. C. Francis likewise affirmed that representativeness in his Foreword to volume 20: "the Society with the prestige it now enjoys and the great success it has had is substantially the image of its Editor." The development of the journal's reputation can be charted by the responses it evoked from the TLS : recognition was instant ("the Papers [as the first volume was called] . . ., under Dr. Bowers's aegis, are rapidly earning their place on the same reference shelf as the transactions of the senior societies of London, New York, Edinburgh and Oxford" [24 August 1951]), and its leadership soon came to be taken for granted ("Professor Bowers's annual has become so firmly established a pillar of the bibliographical establishment that the reviewer could perhaps confine himself to a list of this year's contents" [1 July 1965]) and its place with respect to the earlier journals uncontested ("The new periodical rapidly established an authority rivalling that of The Library , and it has maintained its distinguished position ever since; by now every bibliographer is in its debt" [27 April 1966]). In 1962 the French journal Études Anglaises observed, "Cette publication annuelle est peut-être la plus remarquable que nous offrent les grandes presses des Etats-Unis: l'érudition est à l'honneur quand elle est aussi magnifiquement servie par la typographie et réciproquement, car celle-ci reçoit alors un hommage que trop souvent elle dédaigne. [This annual publication is perhaps the most remarkable offered by any of the great publishing houses of the United States. Its erudition is well served by the typography which, in turn, does honor to the erudition, usually disdainful of such mundane matters.]" Despite the instant success of Studies , three early anxieties persisted and became permanent concomitants of the journal: where would the articles, money, and editorial assistance come from to produce the next volume? Bowers's assiduity in pursuing papers is a theme in the broader history of SB that G. Thomas Tanselle treats elsewhere in the current volume, but it is worth identifying here as well, for it typifies the way that Studies preoccupied Bowers for forty-five years. Tanselle notes how Bowers served on William Todd's Chicago dissertation committee in the summer of 1949 and how (by arrangements already underway) Todd's series of important contributions to Studies began that year; that same summer Bowers not only compiled his Supplement to . . . Woodward &amp; McManaway (1949.2) and garnered Paul Morrison's personnel index to the STC (1950.3) for publication by the Society, but he also consummated an agreement with the English Institute to print papers from its bibliographical section. One of those was "a magnificent paper by Greg which I had been sweating blood to get" (letter to Massey, 16 September 1949). Extant letters also show some other ways that articles came about. He once wrote Massey (3 Sept. 1963) that at a professional meeting he had seen a scholar whose "tongue was hanging out to give a paper here before the Society . . . and then hand it over to Studies " (the topic, moreover, promised to appeal to "our British friends"). Just as Bowers solicited on behalf of other activities of the Society, other Society members looked out for Studies . Hence when Wyllie noted an item of special interest in Waller Barrett's collection, he told Bowers, who "is writing direct to Waller to ask him to write the thing up for a note in the next volume" (Wyllie letter to Massey, 5 November 1954). Sometimes the crucial step was simply to ask, as is implicit in a 12 May 1955 letter to Bowers from Faulkner scholar Carvel Collins ("I do know your Studies in Bibliography and am flattered that you should ask me to submit a piece for it") or explicit in my own case, in which, after my work came to Bowers's attention while we were in the British Library in 1978, he invited me to let him see it when I had something written up. To the end of his life he was anxious about where copy for the next volume was going to come from. The concern over finding material to print was compounded by the need for the volumes to appeal to appropriate constituencies. The desired range was broad, but the scholarship available did not always match. Though a large number of pieces in the first volume were by local writers and three of them were of special local interest (each touching in some way on Jefferson), and though he recognized the importance of local supporters to the continuing existence of Studies , Bowers also realized that "by their nature our Papers will probably grow less rather than more Virginian." "John is rightly very concerned that we print in the Papers a reasonable number of American bibliographical articles," he wrote Massey on 19 April 1949; I shall always try to, but . . . such articles of equal standard are the very hardest to get [they are "as scarce as good 19th or 20th century material," he noted]. What will happen to our various subscribers throughout the state with the next issue when we have no Virginiana except for a note on Jefferson's Notes , I don't know; nor how much they are guided by local interest. It is such members that I am all hot to keep in line by mimeographed material, especially in those years when by ill chance there is not much of local interest in the Papers . His suggestion was to expand the purview of mimeographed publications to include writings related to Virginian and American history-- "if they could be brought in any broad sense under the term `bibliographical' as being concerned with documents of whatever nature." While appreciating other activities of the Society for their own sake, he also recognized the complex interdependency of the group's undertakings: "I agree thoroughly with your ideas about more meetings and talks drawing on local talents and on such subjects as you suggest. . . . the Society exists as more than simply a publishing organization, and if we wither here, we shall wither nationally. . . . There is, possibly, a delicate balance between our local membership, the size of our dues, and the financial requirements of the Papers, to say nothing of possible monographs in the future if we can get the proper backing." The instant praise that Studies elicited brought an equally speedy offer from the University of North Carolina Press to publish subsequent numbers as well as any separate monographs the Society might produce. Massey noted that proposal in an April 1949 letter to University President Colgate Darden, who had just written to thank Massey for a major gift that guaranteed that the second volume of the journal would appear. Massey pointed out what he believed (and what proved to be right) but what was also calculated to encourage Darden's favor: his gift to the Society had been "actuated solely from my interest in it and my conviction that through it the University has a unique opportunity to enhance its reputation for scholarship throughout the world in a field offering little academic competition." These remarks and the reference to North Carolina were particularly shrewd because the University was still smarting from an article a decade earlier (June 1935) by Edwin R. Embree in the Atlantic Monthly . Appraising American universities, Embree had found that no university in the South ranked as "eminent" or even "leading," and that out of 206 university departments in the country rated as distinguished, only one was in that region--at North Carolina. In Massey's 1956 history of the Society he described the precarious financing of the first volume of Studies : [Bowers] was named to the post of Permanent Editor by acclamation when agreement was reached on a proposal to publish an annual book of Studies, despite a lack of funds and any likelihood of financial success. Money in insufficient but helpful amounts was generously appropriated by the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center, and later by the Research committee of the University of Virginia; and the William Byrd Press of Richmond through Mr. Willis Shell indicated a heart-warming faith in our venture by undertaking the designing, composition and press work at virtual cost, with an infinity to pay. The Society itself confidently voted imaginary sums and committed all actual cash within sight to this ambitious and unlikely gamble. Meanwhile the Society also needed to divert cash for other projects, including any separate publications it was to produce (and which might produce financial profits). The $800 deficit that remained from the first SB was funded from the next year's dues and then bumped along from year to year. Several times the Society appealed to the University for a grant that "would thus place us beyond any strict need for deficit financing of the sort that we have been committed to for a decade" (letter of Wyllie to Provost Joseph Vaughan, 13 December 1957); on 22 October 1959 President Edgar Shannon wrote that in order to get the Society "completely out of the red" he was approving $1013 from the Alumni Fund for the Society, noting that "I don't have to tell you how interested I am in the Bibliographical Society, and how proud I am of its accomplishments since its inception." The money was also gratifying in that it marked formal University support of the Society. Massey had called attention to the lack of such recognition in his letter of request (on 24 October 1959): The Society will soon begin its fourteenth year. During its lifetime, beyond grants from the Research Committee, a small allocation of funds from the Alderman Library, and valuable though intangible help from staff members in certain Departments, the Society has received no official aid or cognizance from the University itself. The earlier funds had indeed been useful, but they had to be applied for annually, they were fairly small to begin with, and they kept declining (down to $200 for volume 15, with a spurt in the final year, for volume 17, to $480). Grants from the Richmond Area University Center shared those features, except that they were even smaller, usually to cover the cost of publishing articles of individual faculty. The shaky financial standing of the journal quite naturally concerned no one more than Bowers. The gratitude in his response (on 14 April 1949) to Massey's gift toward volume 2 was therefore profound: John just called me tonight to tell me of your extremely generous gift towards publication of the Papers . I must say the sum was staggering, but God knows we can use it. Needless to say, according to your wishes the donor will remain firmly anonymous, but that fact cannot prevent me from writing my very real personal appreciation for what you have done. I cannot conceal that the financial troubles of the Papers have weighed very heavily on my mind, and that I now feel an enormous weight removed. Bowers in fact felt so buoyed by the surety of adequate pages in volume 2 that he stayed up into the early hours of the next day to expand a note he had written into an article. With his heavy personal investment in the journal, it is not surprising that he responded to Massey much the same way a few years later: I understand from John confidentially that with your invariable anonymous generosity you have once more helped with the expenses of the Studies . I hope you know how much personally this means to me. (18 Nov. 1953) Bowers was known for his long, single-spaced letters, but his series to Massey in April 1949, when the future of SB and the direction of the Society lay in question, reiterate in their appearance how seriously he took these questions: his calculation of possibilities on the 19th, for instance, contains about 3000 words typed on four dense pages, with a 500-word postscript by hand on a fifth sheet. Meanwhile Bowers was looking for ways in which he could help directly. When it was unclear whether money was sufficient to add a few pages of short but important notes to the next volume, he told Massey, "Although I don't have the folding money to indulge myself in this sort of thing, I am prepared to put up, strictly anonymously, a hundred dollars to help get this other material in print so far as it can be done for this sum" (30 April 1949). A few years later he noted the local Research Committee's friendly hope that "we should be self-supporting in the future" but observed that "I do not anticipate trouble next year. Both Gemmill and I are now in the inner sanctum group which actually makes the awards" (18 November 1953). The financial security that the Society sought for Studies based on a permanent subsidy never materialized. Bowers had hopes for lasting support particularly after he returned in 1949 from his first summer of teaching in Chicago--with "a flattering offer to come out there" for good, as he wrote Massey on 16 September. "A similar journal bulked very large in the Chairman's mind at Chicago, and he stated it would be subsidized there without question. I had a very interesting summer seeing how the other half lives. Everyone at Chicago knew of the Papers and admired them." On the other hand, he also understood the realities of local politics: I hate to think of vol. 3! So far as I can gather from casual conversations with Mrs. Shea [Council member and wife of the University's chief financial officer], her pipeline has it that the University simply feels it cannot put out money except for projects affecting more people. . . . There is no need deploring this attitude as it affects the University's ideas of how scholarship is produced, because it has very little idea. Officially I suspect it sets up the Research Committee and washes its hands of the whole business. . . . We simply do not fit in with his [the University president's] state- interest concept and reach too few people in his estimation. That at least 200 of the people we do reach are worth more than 20,000 newspaper readers albeit taxpayers is not a concept he can entertain. He doesn't see the number of scholars we reach through library copies, either, and this large audience directly affects the University's academic prestige. (Letter to Massey, 19 April 1949) Gradually, as separate publications began generating their own profits and the annual dues of members covered production costs of the journal, this centerpiece of the Society's activity did achieve relative financial stability. But throughout his life Bowers remained mindful of the Society and journal's contingent existence (on 23 April 1981 he wrote Kendon Stubbs that "Since I have got in the habit of thinking of the Society as poor, I have too often substituted my time for money that perhaps should have been spent on professional readers" for Society publications). Partly by nature he looked constantly for little ways to improve the financial situation of Studies . When the Richmond Area University Center was providing publishing grants to faculty, he planned to have Coolie Verner apply: "The saving to us will not be great, since it is unlikely that Verner's article in type will run to more than five or six pages, but every little bit helps and is worth a distinct effort, which we shall give it" (letter to Massey, 30 April 1949). The switch from 16-page gatherings to 32-page ones in 1985 was to save a slight bit of money, as was the transfer of footnotes from the bottom of the page to the end of the article in 1988 through 1990. His frequent advice to trim the size of articles came from his good editorial sense, but Bowers was also mindful that what was not worth publishing was not worth paying for. The third worry that dogged Bowers as Studies editor was the need for a suitable assistant- -and eventually for a successor. At first various minor but incessant chores were taken care of in the library, though Bowers recognized (in a letter to Massey, 19 April 1949) that "how long we can expect the library staff to do our clerical work for us is an open question." At the start, when all officers devoted themselves equally to all activities, the other leaders helped with the Society's journal. In those early days he wrote Massey, "I am 100 per cent behind your ideas for expanding the activities of the Society and creating a more general interest. To my mind this is as important as the Papers; and I am against anything which would tend to make the Papers seem my own private project. No one knows better than I do that they are not, and without John's hard work and your encouragement there would be no Papers" (20 September 1949). Proof for the articles went not only to Bowers but also to Wyllie, whose secretary Miss Jean McCauley would prepare a table of contents and other preliminary matter. Permission to proceed with printing required the authorization of the Council, especially in the early days when the availability of money to do so was never assured, and until at least the late 1970s the Council received reports on the cost per page of the current volume. On the other hand, Bowers was also in control of various non-editorial details from the start. An early letter (13 July 1949) from Wyllie to Willis Shell at the William Byrd Press reveals that Bowers was the one who decided to use different binding colors from year to year: Fred Bowers is thinking about varying the shade of the stock cover [for SB 2]. He has a green or blue in mind. Do you have some samples around that you could send him? The object would be to get something that could stand next to the brown volume without clashing. In later years, through preparation for the 1989 volume, the color selection became the subject of an annual ritualistic visit by Bowers to Janet Anderson at the University Press. As time went by, the duties connected with producing Studies only increased, as did the proportion of them that fell to Bowers, especially about the time Wyllie was promoted to University Librarian. Several younger colleagues whom he hoped would be able to help fell victim to English Department politics or left the University for other reasons. His frustration boiled over several times in 1957. In one letter to Massey (6 February) he reported that he had told the English Department chairman-- Atcheson Hench, former president of the Society--that "I seemed to be expected to take over all the business details with the Press down to seeing the last reprint gets out on time; and I was disinclined to do some of the work expected of me and wanted some help." He added that "we need people on the Council who will do some work and contribute more to the Society than a sociable evening," also pointing out that he had "just fired the proofreader Wyllie hired, as incompetent, and will do the work myself again." He was still distressed that fall, writing Massey, "I suspect we should consider printing in England, pretty soon. I am determined from now on not to substitute my time for the normal printer's proofreading. In fact, I haven't got the time, nor do other members of the Society. This last year or two has been a nightmare for me about proofs . . ." (20 September). Significant help arrived in the fall of 1960 in the form of Lester Beaurline, who joined the English Department after receiving his Ph.D. earlier that year at Chicago, where Bowers had gotten to know him. Part of his attractiveness to the Department, Bowers later wrote, "was the solution of the SB problem" (letter to Beaurline, 2 March 1973). In volume 17 (for 1964), Beaurline first appeared on the title page, as Assistant Editor. He held that designation the following year as well, and then from volumes 19 through 27 (1966 through 1974) worked as Associate Editor. (In 1967 he and Bowers also published a two-volume edition of Dryden's plays.) The measure of his ever- increasing responsibilities during that period can be gauged by a gentle admonishment he received from Massey about the volume for 1969: "As I am sure you have been reminded many times Studies 22 was a bit long, and we did exceed our budget figure" (29 March 1969). The difficulty had arisen when a commissioned but tardy article arrived after others had been accepted to fill the apparent void; the counsel from Massey suggests the large role Beaurline had come to play. In his years at the journal his responsibilities grew, just as they had earlier for Bowers, and for his final half-dozen years there he had the assistance of graduate students for clerical and proof-reading jobs. In those years his interests had changed as well; to the extent they remained bibliographical, they found expression especially in building the replica of a common press for the Alderman Press and in printing books of poetry there. About 1970 Bowers asked Beaurline whether he would like to take over as editor if Bowers himself resigned; Beaurline decided he would not, and he participated in the recruitment of a candidate for the English Department who would fill that role. That person declined, just as he had turned down a position in the Department in the mid 1960s. On 28 February 1973 Beaurline submitted to Bowers his resignation. "I really have too many other duties and interests to carry on with Studies any longer," he wrote; "As of June 1, I'll have to turn to my own research &amp; writing--none of which I have touched for two years." Bowers was concerned that the Department, having thought the " SB problem" was settled, might be less amenable than earlier to hiring someone to serve as a replacement for Beaurline and then successor to himself. But the following year, Bowers's penultimate before retirement from teaching, the Department did extend another offer; that prospect too declined. Meanwhile various Assistants to the Editor were hired to perform some of the work for Studies : Gillian Kyles for volume 27 (for 1974, the final one Beaurline worked on) through volume 29; Clint Sisson for volumes 28 and 29; and Susan Hitchcock for volume 30. But Bowers's decades-old problem remained. On 18 November 1984 he wrote his oldest son that "There is a young man just hired at the University who seems promising and maybe I shall see if he is interested and start breaking him in within a year or so, and then see if he can take over." That fall the English Department had invited me to join the faculty, with the special duties of teaching eighteenth-century English literature courses as well as classes in bibliography and in textual criticism, and with the responsibility of helping Bowers on Studies . What was in effect my probation began that autumn as Bowers asked my thoughts about some articles that had been submitted. In the familiar pattern for those who have worked with SB , activity quickly picked up, and at the end of the following year I was listed in the forthcoming volume (39, for 1986) as "Assistant to the Editor." "Assistant Editor" followed for four years, and after that "Associate Editor." Bowers's death on 11 April 1991 forced the question of his successor once and for all, and the Council of the Society appointed me to the editorship of Studies , adding Elizabeth Lynch as a part-time Assistant to the Editor in 1994. The continually changing nature of the Society's publication program required steady adjustments in the organizational structure of the Society as well. Duties in the early days were shared, though if the number of acknowledgements in prefaces is an accurate gauge, authors of works published in the first decade perceived Wyllie as most involved and Bowers as also providing significant help. As the Society finally shed the financial debt that had clung from the start and as its ventures into hardcover publishing provided a sense of what it might accomplish, Massey in 1959 formally established an "Editorial Advisory Committee for Monographic Publications." Wyllie described this group in a letter of 8 April 1964 to a prospective contributor: The Society's miscellaneous publications fall under the judgment of an editorial board of which Dean Arthur Stocker is Chairman. The two other members are Fredson Bowers and myself. We accept or reject manuscripts, and ones accepted in principle then fall under the usual copy-editing processes of Mr. Victor Reynolds of the University Press of Virginia, who handles all further problems of design, proof, and production with the author. This system continued until the death of Wyllie in 1968. But even within it different poles of attraction operated, with Massey and Wyllie less committed than Bowers to devoting the publishing program exclusively to serious scholarship (Wyllie differed from Massey, however, in being more willing to publish work in progress). Not that those two were unscholarly, by any means. In a characteristic reaction, Wyllie expressed disappointment after his first Rosenbach Lecture in 1960 over the audience's lack of seriousness; in the same vein, Massey reminded a member of the Faulkner concordance project in 1971 that "such concordances based on faulty texts will have little value; definitive texts are a necessity, I should imagine, before any considerable work could be done on concordances." But they also kept themselves from becoming overwhelmed by the gravity of what the Society was up to. In Secretary's News Sheet 8 (September 1948), Wyllie spoke as one whose feelings were not engaged in what obviously mattered to others: "Two of our members, Mr. Fredson Bowers and Mr. Paul Dunkin, are having a running fight over definitions of state and issue in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America." When an angry correspondent wrote Wyllie in 1958 that a graduate student's article had made him look like an "ignoramus," Wyllie replied, "Bibliographers are a funny breed anyway, and all I try to do is coexist with them." Massey's distance surfaced intermittently in his reminders to people that he was not an academic insider (and, indeed, that he wouldn't necessarily wish to be); as he wrote a friend on 25 December 1970, "I have always kept myself well in the background, and I should be reluctant to find my successor [as Society President] using the office to promote himself, as can so easily happen in the Groves of Academe." These attitudes came to bear on the publications program at the Council meeting of 30 April 1966, when Massey asked, "Should the Society enlarge its aims?" According to the minutes, "The President expressed his fear that, having identified itself largely with analytical bibliography, the Society is losing ground quantitatively, and that consequently it should broaden its appeal to include book collectors and others for whom analytical bibliography is of limited interest." The debate, then, was over the same questions the Society had faced at its inception twenty years earlier. The minutes continue: "In reply, Mr. Stocker argued that the particular strength and distinguishing mark of the Society has been its emphasis on analytical bibliography; and it was pointed out by others that both the monograph publications and Studies itself have by no means been devoted exclusively to analytical bibliography." The outcome of the discussion was the establishment of a new series to be edited by Walker Cowen and "intended to merit the interest of members in areas of literature beyond analytical bibliography." One such volume was ultimately produced, the edition of Hawthorne's Poems in 1967. In the necessary discussion about reorganizing publications after Wyllie's death, Stocker wrote Massey that customary procedure "when our Committee had completed consideration of an item" had been to "turn it over to John Wyllie, who carried on all the negotiations with the Press" (31 May 1968). (Wyllie's major role had prompted at least one author to call him "Editor of the Monograph Series" [1960.4].) Massey now proposed a three-member Finance Committee, with himself as chairman, that would create an overall plan for publishing ventures, that would receive proposals from what was now called the Publications Committee, and that upon review of the Society's finances would give authorization to print. By subjecting decisions about publishing to wider scrutiny, he hoped the new system would lead to "fewer titles, better books, and far fewer Technical Reports" (letter to Stocker, 25 October 1968). One of the victims of the housecleaning was the "serial analyticals," library catalog cards for individual articles in Studies that the Society provided (at 324 to 64 each over the years) for all volumes through 1969 but for which requests were now diminishing. (An example of this series, in effect another Society publication, can be seen at the top of the third column of volume 217, page 303, of the National Union Catalog .) The two-committee system proved cumbersome, and after consulting the Council Massey replaced the groups early the next year with a single Executive Committee consisting of Bowers, Cowen, Ray Frantz, and himself. Its duties combined those of the separate committees: to supervise the disposition of tendered manuscripts and to administer the Society's publication funds in an orderly way. Each new manuscript was to be forwarded by the Society's Secretary to Cowen, who would either reject it out of hand or submit it to an expert reader. Calling for "fewer and much better titles and texts," Massey said in a memorandum of 28 February 1969 that only after "the book has met our rigid scholarly standards" would the committee itself formally consider the project and its attendant scheduling and financing. One of his special hopes was that the system would thwart the possibility of publications becoming the custody of a single person. In a report on the status of Society activities after the death of Massey in late 1974, Kendon Stubbs described this plan as it had by then evolved, including in its name: Although there formally is a Publications Committee, decisions about accepting or rejecting manuscripts and what format and in how many copies they should be issued had come to be made on the whole by Linton after seeking advice from Walker and me, or occasionally others. Correspondence was handled about equally by the three, Linton writing initial letters to prospective authors, I doing the acceptance or rejection letters, and Walker usually writing about the technical details of editing and book production. In 1977 Bowers was elected chairman of the committee; all three major founders of the Society had now served the equivalent of that role. One of his first actions was to meet with Cowen "to discuss various ways of lowering publication expenses," according to the Council minutes of 4 June 1977, and he fretted over the number and quality of incoming manuscripts as much as his predecessors had (this accounts in part for his editorial work noted earlier on several descriptive bibliographies). Minutes of 17 November the next year reveal that the committee's general procedures were straightforward: "As in the past, all new manuscripts are to be sent to Mr. Bowers, who will in turn present them to the committee"-- which at that time consisted also of Cowen, Mrs. Massey, and Stubbs. Bowers acted in that capacity for over a decade, followed by Stubbs and then, in 1991, by another member drawn from the existing committee, Ruthe Battestin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V The ratio of the number of people that the Society has served, both within the organization and beyond, to the number of those working at its core may be one of the highest for any scholarly institution. The size of the official membership has, quite naturally, fluctuated over the years, but a number of trends are evident. The Society grew with unusual quickness from the 130 charter members (itself a surprisingly high number) listed in the attachment to the first Secretary's News Sheet in 1947. By 1952 membership had grown to nearly 500, and a 1958 news story on the occasion of the Grolier visit reported (probably with an exaggeration in the count by 10%) that the Society "has 1000 members scattered all over the earth" (Richmond Times-Dispatch , 19 October 1958). The definition of "members" is complicated and an exact count therefore difficult because many institutions have chosen to order their copies of Studies directly from the University Press, but the highest enrollment appears to have come in the early 1970s; around the time of the Society's twenty-fifth anniversary, about 950 members were on Society rolls and another 200 or 300 institutions held standing orders with the Press (these in addition to customers who purchased volumes of SB ad hoc). Since then the number has gradually declined to about 550 formal memberships and 150 standing orders. (Individual sales also continue; the 1000 copies for 1995 sold out.) The greater part of that reduction has been the result of institutional cancellations as library budgets have been trimmed; recently personal memberships have actually increased slightly. The latter had predominated in the early decades, with the institutional ones finally matching and then surpassing them in the 1970s (though a decade earlier if standing orders through the Press are taken into account). Currently institutions account for 55% of formal memberships. The geographical distribution of members also changed over time. This data is hard to reconstruct with precision, but the years for which reasonably thorough evidence is available (the earliest, the fifth, and the latest) show early strength in Charlottesville followed by a rapid expansion beyond and an increasing acceptance by institutions. Because some early addresses cannot be determined, the annual totals in the following chart (which do not include the Press's standing orders) do not quite add up to the figures cited above. For reference, one might note that the high water mark occurred in 1972, when the Society held 468 individual memberships, 496 institutional ones, and about 200 standing orders through the Press. 1947 1952 1996 Personal Personal Institutional Personal Institutional Charlottesville 68 80 0 34 2 Other Virginia 45 69 5 10 10 Other U.S. 11 173 109 129 160 Foreign 1 21 15 68 150 The lone foreign subscription in 1947 belonged to a member at the American Embassy in Iceland; by 1952 twenty-six countries were represented. Today memberships come from thirty-one countries--mostly from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom (76), Germany (30, all but 3 institutional), Canada (24), Japan (15, all but 2 personal), and Australia (14). To ease problems of currency exchange and to establish bibliographical ambassadors, the Society early on appointed Honorary Secretary-Treasurers in foreign countries. These began in 1952 with the British Isles (Mrs. Douglas Wyllie), Chile (Ricardo Donoso), Finland (Lauri O. Th. Tudeer; later Jorma Vallinkoski), France (Henry A. Talon), and India (S. R. Ranganathan), followed a couple years later by Germany (Richard Mummendey), the Netherlands (Johan Gerritsen), and Venezuela (Pedro Grases) and then in 1964 by Sweden (Rolf du Rietz). Most of these people served continuously until 1969, when the Society abolished all posts in this increasingly complex system except for the British Isles. When in 1991 the Council finally acceded to Mrs. Wyllie's wish to retire, it found her successor in R. J. Goulden. At about that time it also added Honorary Secretary- Treasurers for Australia and New Zealand (Ross Harvey; later Brian N. Gerrard) and Japan (Hiroshi Yamashita). Establishing these positions was a recognition of actual and potential interest in those countries; by the same token, it is a tribute to the representatives that memberships there are now among the largest outside the U.S. The categories of membership available at any one time have reflected the changing circumstances of the Society. It quickly became apparent that the original $2.00 membership fee was inadequate to provide for an annual volume of papers, and in preparation for the second volume (1949-50) the basic dues were raised to $4.50. Not all members were necessarily interested in that scholarly direction, however, and accordingly at the 28 September 1949 annual meeting a range of membership categories was established. Regular or "Subscribing Members" received the new annual as well as "all other bibliographical material" issued by the Society; "Resident or Associate Members," at $2.50, had the privilege of attending Society meetings and received the News Sheet and selected pamphlet publications but not Studies --benefits apparently shared by "Student Members" (at $1.50), except for the pamphlets; and "Contributing Members," like "Subscribing Members," received all publications but by their benefactions of $15 or more assisted specially "in furthering the work of the Society." The "Associate" class was dropped in 1952, though the informality of the organization meant that policies could be improvised. To a man in the Air Force who objected to having to pay dues while abroad, Wyllie wrote: "Gosh man, we will make a rule. Members on active service in enlisted grades will be carried as in full standing without payment of dues during the period of their active service. At least we will do this now in your case, and if we get into a general war, we will reconsider the whole problem." The constitutionally mandated student category--for UVa students only--was never widely publicized and in 1970 was deleted both as a required division and as a current possibility. The category itself was formally reinstituted in 1990; students anywhere were now eligible, and they received all the benefits of Subscribing Members, but at half the price. By choosing in effect to offer students a copy of Studies at less than the cost of production, the Council sought both to serve an audience not commonly known for its financial resources and to entice members at a formative stage in their intellectual development. The number of Contributing Members, whose names have appeared as a roll call of honor in each volume of Studies , serves as a rough index of the size and activity of the Society. Similar to the fortunes of regular memberships, these rose quickly, reaching a plateau after the first decade but then inching upward to a peak of 66 (19 institutional, 47 personal) in 1968. With a dues rate of $25 for this class of members, who received the results of the stepped-up publications program, the arrangement was less and less to the benefit of the Society; a subsequent doubling of the rate resulted in the loss of 2 institutional and 15 personal members. The new plateau led gently to a valley in the mid 1980s, but since then the number of Contributing Members has risen slightly: in 1996 there were 34. Overall 148 individuals and 80 institutions have signed up in this classification. From 1964 through 1969 the Society advertised a sub-category of Contributors, that of "Life Members," for a one-time payment of $150. Massey, Wyllie, and Thomas O. Mabbott enrolled at once, followed shortly by B. C. Bloomfield, Lester J. Cappon, Francis O. Mattson, and Victor G. F. Reynolds. With visions of how it could serve its communities better if it had greater resources, the Council at its September 1996 meeting established upper categories of "Patron" ($250+) and "Benefactor" ($500+), hoping to attract the contributions of those who might be content with no other reward than the public thanks of the Society in Studies and the knowledge of having done good. This appeal for additional funds arose at a time when the Society's cash reserves had nearly vanished. A graph of such monies across the life of the Society shows the accumulation of a few thousand dollars in the first decade but then their dwindling; a gentle rise to about $10,000 in the mid 1960s; and then a skyrocketing as the Society began marketing through the University Press while also producing more substantial books--to nearly $50,000 in 1980 and almost twice that by 1995. Yet when measured against similar societies, the Virginia one has been relatively poor. The sudden fall-off in 1996 is actually a sign of the Society's good health, however, for the money went into a revitalized publications program (too recent for any proceeds to have returned) and into making the back issues of SB available in electronic form. (In his Executive Committee Budget for 1971, Massey had noted that the cash balance had been increasing partly because the Society had not published anything recently but was resting on the laurels and profits of books in the warehouse.) Although the Society acknowledged that it would never recoup directly the money spent on the electronic project, it undertook the expense cheerfully, believing that the increased availability would be of service to scholarship and that the project might serve as a model and encouragement for others. Traditionally the Society's funds have come from three sources: dues, which approximately pay for Studies ; publications, which on the whole have generated a profit; and gifts, which have financed sundry other undertakings but which have also enabled the primary ones to stay afloat at crucial times. For three years, from 1966 through 1968, the Society administered an anonymous grant (Paul Mellon has now given permission to be identified as the donor) to Allan Stevenson "for the development of new techniques in the dating of undated English books, with special reference to the early period." Before this Stevenson had published four revolutionary articles on paper study in Studies ; a product of his new research, "Tudor Roses from John Tate," appeared in SB 20. In 1966 the Society applied for a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support its monograph program. (That agency's parent organization was also the subject of perhaps the only public lobbying by the Society. On 20 January 1970 Massey wrote Senator Harry Byrd and others in support of President Nixon's proposal to fund it anew, reminding them that "While this internationally known Society with over twelve hundred members will not itself benefit from the funds administered under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, we do in this materialistic and mechanistic world view with concern any threat to the already limited recognition given by the Federal Government to the humanities.") Though the Society's application to the NEH was unsuccessful, Bowers's own editing projects for authors from five centuries sometimes did receive such funds. These undertakings were not formally connected with the Bibliographical Society, but they are a reminder of how the Society represented an ongoing corporate presence for bibliography at the University and how it created a climate for such work to thrive. The same could be said for other local accomplishments--the library's publication of Joan Crane's bibliographical catalogue of the Robert Frost collection, for instance, or her and Anne Freudenberg's catalog of a Faulkner exhibition in honor of Massey. Nor does the Society have a formal relationship with Terry Belanger's Book Arts Press, despite the many connections that exist. It was, however, the bibliographical tradition created by the Society at the University that made Charlottesville appealing when the Columbia Library School closed in the early 1990s, and it was that same tradition that made University administrators eager to welcome this additional linking of books and the University. The Society's most consistent financial hope was for permanent funding by the University. Aspirations were highest in the early years as the Society sought a way of guaranteeing the existence of Studies , but they also rose, unrequitedly, when at the death of Wyllie the Society sought ongoing support for a secretary. That need, however, pointed to what the University had already provided. Apart from the small grants the Society had received from the University's Research Committee, it had from the start utilized the services of the secretaries of Wyllie and of his successor as Rare Books Curator, Bill Runge. Beginning in 1950 some of this assistance was reflected in the Society's budget as a $100 subsidy from the library in the form of mimeograph supplies, postage and stationery, and Addressograph plates. On Wyllie's death the library provided the Society with a business office, which it still maintains. In various intangible ways the departments whose members serve on the Council have supported that work; most significantly, the English Department now considers Studies in Bibliography one of the official duties of its editor, and when that department moved into a new building in 1995 it provided an office for the first editorial quarters the journal has had. The Society also has the privilege of bearing the name of the University, a responsibility it has attempted to honor by in turn adding respect to that source--often by taking under its banner the accomplishments of people with no other connection to the school. The broader membership of the Bibliographical Society has found its representatives in the thirty-three members who have served on the Council, some of them as officers. (The fluctuating combinations of these overseers can be traced in the annual lists in Studies .) Those of the first decade have already been noted: Joseph M. Carrière, Mrs. Randolph Catlin, Miss Lucy T. Clark, Jack Dalton, Chalmers L. Gemmill, Atcheson L. Hench, Sears R. Jayne, William B. O'Neal, Mrs. Vincent Shea, Willis A. Shell, Jr., Charles W. Smith, Hugh M. Spencer, Arthur F. Stocker, and Philip Williams--in addition to Bowers, Massey, and Wyllie. Because of the impact that the latter three had on the organization, it is reasonable to view their departures as demarcating major phases in the Society's history, with Wyllie's death in 1968 marking the end of the first stage. Many of the early Councilors remained through the two decades of Wyllie's presence, and a number of additional ones joined during that time (the years of their doing so are given in parentheses): William Runge (1962), a former graduate student in History who had become Curator of Rare Books Irby Cauthen (1960), a faculty member in the English Department who had previously been a graduate student there; and Anne Ehrenpreis (1966), a literary scholar in her own right and wife of Swift biographer Irvin Ehrenpreis in the English Department. The second period of the Society extended from 1968 to approximately the time of Bowers's death in 1991. Massey himself died in 1974, relatively soon after Wyllie, but the changes instituted in those half dozen years characterized the Society for its second pair of decades. (At the Council meeting where Kendon Stubbs was elected President a month after Massey's death, "Mr. Cowen suggested that Mr. Stubbs continue managing the Society as it has been going in the past until it is decided how the work should be distributed.") New Council members reflected new circumstances in the Society's life, but most of these people had already been connected with the Society and represented interests that the Council had traditionally encompassed. Fresh Councilors in this era included: Kendon Stubbs (1966), a graduate student in the English Department in the early 1960s who subsequently was appointed to various posts in the University library, including that of Associate Librarian; Ray Frantz (1968), University Librarian; Walker Cowen (1971), Director of the University Press; Julius Barclay (1974), Rare Book Curator; Mrs. Linton Massey (1975), a notable collector of botanical books who formally joined the Council upon the death of her husband; and Ruthe Battestin (1979), a researcher with wide experience in the book world and later collaborator on the standard biography of Henry Fielding with her husband Martin in the University's English Department. The demise of Bowers coincided with an unusual number of changes in the Council's make-up--as well as the last meeting at Kinloch. A number of the added members were recent arrivals at the University: Nancy Essig (1990), the new University Press Director; Kathryn Morgan (1991), the new Rare Book Curator; Terry Belanger (1993), the Director of the Book Arts Press; and Karin Wittenborg (1994), the new University Librarian. On the other hand, Penelope F. Weiss (1993) had been the Society's Executive Secretary since 1986. Furthermore, two of the most symbolic changes, in the editorship of Studies and the presidency, involved other people who already had a significant connection with the Society. I had begun working with Bowers on the journal soon after joining the English Department in 1984 (I was elected to the Council in 1986), and the new role as editor was an extension of earlier ones. G. Thomas Tanselle, elected a Council member and President in 1993, had published in Studies annually since 1963 and had become a friend of Bowers; the world of bibliography and textual criticism had in fact sometimes linked their names, often with that of Greg, as a hyphenated adjective. Tanselle succeeded Irby Cauthen, who not only had provided stability as President since 1978 but also was a charter member. What was striking about Tanselle's appointment was that it marked the first time (except in the case of Willis Shell, of Richmond) that a Council member came from outside Charlottesville. His selection was nonetheless very much in keeping with the national and international character that the Society had assumed very early, an expansion presaged by Massey's own involvement from beyond the University Grounds. Over the years the Council has nominally supervised the work of the Society, reflecting on the Society's initiatives and direction at its semi-annual meetings and providing assistance and organization for activities ranging from teas and book collecting contests to the publishing program. What that means in practice is that the Society has run chiefly under the guidance of its officers. In the report Stubbs prepared for the Society in 1974, he observed that "In the somewhat false terms of business management the Society can be described as having two productive functions [the production of Studies and of monographs], carried out essentially by about six personnel." It is also the case that the organizational structures of the Society became largely those that were dictated by the publishing program (as described above). During the long stint of Massey's executorship, coordination of all functions was chiefly his. (He was President for all of the Society's first twenty-eight years except the first and fourth; Chalmers Gemmill served in 1947, and Atcheson Hench in 1950.) Of the Society's presidents, he was able to exercise the greatest involvement in its day- to-day affairs. In Stubbs's report, he remarked that "Linton's great gift was to be a gadfly to all of us, making sure that Pat Shutts' accounts were up-to-date or that I wrote to prospective authors, helping Walker determine the retail price of a publication, worrying with Fred about the costs of composition for Studies ." He added that "it is hard to conceive that the Society would have survived without his kind of constant and courteous attention to every detail." In those years Wyllie and Bowers were also incessantly active, gradually developing their own bailiwicks but having the overall welfare of the Society at heart and helping in whatever ways they might. The others Stubbs may have had in mind can be gleaned largely from a record of Society officers. Arthur Stocker was the first with a significantly long tenure; he was Vice-President from 1951 to 1957, and then in 1959 answered the call to be in charge of the important board that supervised publications. When Wyllie's role of Secretary-Treasurer was split into two offices in 1962, Bill Runge took on communication with the wider world as Secretary, meanwhile also serving as a chief organizer of the Typogs. Three others assumed official positions in the reorganization that followed Wyllie's death. Walker Cowen took the new post of Second Vice-President; his occupation as Press Director made him vitally involved with all Society publications for the next twenty years. The roles of Secretary and Treasurer were recombined and assigned to Ray Frantz, who distinguished himself by tending with notable success for twenty-five years to the finances and legalities of the Society in its days of greatest prosperity. During the final years of Linton Massey's presidency Kendon Stubbs had been Assistant Secretary; his effectiveness there and his keen insight into Society operations made him a natural choice to succeed Massey as President. When Irby Cauthen began as President in 1978, Stubbs took over the vice-presidency, the role in which he continues to serve the Society in which he has been an official for nearly thirty years. Gradually another role also came into prominence in the Society, that of Executive Secretary. Historically, much of the clerical work of the Society, including the processing of memberships, had been carried out by secretaries in the Rare Book Room--among them, Miss Evelyn Dollens (who in 1949 became Mrs. John Cook Wyllie), who kept the first membership list on cards; Miss Jean McCauley, also in the early days; and Susan Gunter in the mid 1960s. In the summer of 1968, following Wyllie's death, the Society moved its files and stock from the Rare Book Room and hired its own Secretary, Maxine Greenberg, to work twenty hours a week out of the General Office of the library. Ruth Pennock followed her that autumn, at which time the library granted the Society a room of its own. Elizabeth Wyatt helped to sort and organize Society files the following summer, and in 1971 Patricia B. Shutts took the place of Mrs. Pennock. By the end of the decade the Council recognized that the duties of this position were far more than clerical and that its holder was largely responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization; accordingly, it designated Mrs. Shutts "Executive Secretary." That title has continued for her successors, Florence Fleishman (who served for part of 1986 but then resigned for health reasons) and Penelope Weiss. In 1974 Stubbs estimated that "some two-thirds of her [Mrs. Shutts's] time is devoted to work concerned with Studies and membership and the other third to monographs." Today the SB and membership duties are as exacting as before, but the Society's escalating publications program demand another two-thirds of the Executive Secretary's work. She and the Assistant to the Editor are the only paid employees of the Society, both of them part-time. In his comments in SB 20 celebrating two decades of the Society's development, F. C. Francis noted that although "Persistence is not an unfamiliar characteristic of officials of bibliographical societies," yet "the University of Virginia has in the record of service excelled all its brethren." Amazingly, what Francis saw was only part of what was yet to be. The story of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in its first half century has been that of three great leaders and the people who devotedly worked with them. The Society has passed through stages of development, as any healthy body must: early exuberance and attempts to be all things to all members while it sought its special identity; then solvency, and its orientation as a successful publishing society; and next a fresh vigor under a new president as it has sought to build on its past with an active publishing program (including in electronic forms), public meetings, student participation, and even a reincarnation of the Secretary's News Sheet in the form of an annual presidential letter. A common theme throughout that progress and accomplishment has been the selflessness that has distinguished both the Society and its leaders. Although the achievements of Linton R. Massey and John Cook Wyllie are immediately recognized and appreciated in the book world when they are raised, the men and their work are not as widely known as they might be, for they intentionally minimized their own visibility and placed wider interests above their own. In that regard their spirits were commensurate with the particularly sweet temper of the University Library and the University of Virginia Press at mid century-- a perception of those institutions so widespread and uniform that it seems to be other than the product of mere nostalgia. Fredson Bowers was no less oriented to service; that he published extensively, however, meant by definition that his name went widely to the public, and he did become renowned. His role in the Society, like those of the other long-term participants, changed according to circumstances, but his unwavering commitment, particularly to its monographs and journal, is symbolized by the 45-year duration of his active involvement. In that tradition the leaders of the Society today are likewise distinguished by their willingness to contribute extraordinary amounts of time to its well-being without promise of private gain. Not surprisingly, these attitudes have also characterized the Society itself. Although it is true that the Society would not have prospered without the astute management and attentiveness of Massey, the energy and academic entrepreneurship of Wyllie, and the wisdom and intellect of Bowers, it simply could not have survived without the loyalty of its members-- "scattered all over the earth"--and with their faithful contribution of dues and gifts that have transcended hopes of personal advantage. Institutionally, the Society has been willing to combine for meetings, exhibitions, and publications with whatever groups seemed appropriate in order to achieve the widest good. From its inception to the present the Society has also been willing to place itself in financial jeopardy for the sake of bringing important scholarship to wider audiences--as the initiation of Studies in Bibliography in the first place and now its presentation on the World Wide Web both show. Massey ended his tenth-year account of the Society's journey "from early insolvency to a present impecuniousness" with what, in its double negatives, is a typically modest remark from him: Perhaps under these circumstances it might not be wholly irrelevant to conclude by saying, with a deprecatory flourish reminiscent of the late Mr. George Saintsbury, that all in all the achievement has not been entirely insignificant, nor the results altogether without some attributes of lasting value, in a world by now accustomed to some degree of impermanence and ephemerality. Four decades later the Society need not abandon humility to recognize from a wider vantage point that its work has indeed aided the development of scholarship in a significant way. Moreover, it is not only lasting accomplishments that have continuing value; the ones that have provoked their own overthrow likewise have enduring significance, for without them greater understanding would not have ensued. It is these functions in the development of scholarship that make it important for the Society to prosper in its second half century; it is awareness of these roles in its history that will inspire it to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Note on Sources The location of extant records of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia reflects basic elements in the Society's structure over its first half century. The most extensive documentation for the early decades occurs in the files of President Linton Massey and Secretary- Treasurer John Cook Wyllie. Massey's relevant papers were transferred to the Society's office upon his death; Wyllie's went as part of the immense accumulation of the University Librarian to the University Archives, now part of the Special Collections Department of the library, where they are classified under the general heading RG-12/1. Because all Society business was brought to the attention of Massey, his files of copied and original correspondence are often the most complete that exist for the early years. Disparate papers from Fredson Bowers are collected in Special Collections under Archives grouping RG-21/30 and Manuscripts classification 5691. The Archives in Special Collections also include a segregated group of Society materials under the designation RG-24/2. Of most significance here are financial records from 1953 through 1958 and materials relating to the preparation of Studies in Bibliography from 1965 through 1972, or approximately the years L. A. Beaurline helped Bowers with the journal. Also of interest in these files are correspondence about the first two student book collecting contests and the entries from the first printers' contest. Shelved with rare books in Special Collections is a lengthy run of Society publications under the call number Z1008.V54. The Society's own archives achieved greater coherence once the organization obtained separate space in Alderman Library and as the role of Executive Secretary developed. Existing records of the past twenty-five years, as well as some materials such as ledger books from before then, are now stored in the Society office. On the tenth anniversary of the Society, Linton Massey wittily summarized its history in "Bibliographia Virginiana or Ledgerdemania," Virginia Librarian , 2.4 (January 1956), 41-42. William H. Runge provided a convenient one- page description in volume 2 of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science , ed. Allen Kent and Harold Lancour (1969), p. 406. The activities and personages of the Society have often received attention in the University's student newspaper Cavalier Daily , in the Charlottesville Daily Progress , in the University's Alumni News magazine, and in Chapter and Verse , the publication of the Associates of the University of Virginia Library. The Alumni News of June 1963, for instance, discusses the Cockescraw Press (pp. 10-11, 25), and in Chapter and Verse 4 (February 1976) Clinton Sisson traces its reincarnation as the Alderman Press (pp. 7- 9). One of the most important environments from which the Society emerged is described by Harry Clemons in The University of Virginia Library 1825-1900: Story of a Jefferson Foundation (1954), an account that includes Wyllie's early connections with the library. The resolution that Fredson Bowers prepared and read before the University faculty in memory of Linton Massey appeared in Chapter and Verse 3 (February 1975), 4-8. A photograph of Massey appeared as the frontispiece in Studies in Bibliography 28 (1975), and a biographical account of him by Edmund Berkeley, Jr., is forthcoming in the Dictionary of Literary Biography . The DLB also contains Matthew J. Bruccoli's article (with photographs) on John Cook Wyllie (vol. 140, American Book-Collectors and Bibliographers, First Series , ed. Joseph Rosenblum, 1994, pp. 327-341). G. Thomas Tanselle's The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers , including a chronology and a checklist of Bowers's writings by Martin C. Battestin, was published by the Society in 1993. It reprints, with corrections and an added index, material that first appeared in volume 46 (1993) of SB , and includes a portrait of Bowers. Chalmers Gemmill's history of his department, Pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine (1966), contains a brief sketch and a picture of this first president of the Society. The career of its third president is summarized by Anne Freudenberg in "Atcheson Laughlin Hench," Chapter and Verse 2 (1974), 27, and by Edward A. Stephenson in "Atcheson Laughlin Hench," American Speech 50.3-4 (Fall-Winter 1975), 291-292. On the occasion of his retirement from the University the Cockescraw Press produced a list of his writings: Atcheson Laughlin Hench: A Check List, Nineteen Hundred and Twenty-one--Nineteen Hundred and Sixty-two (1962). I am indebted to the following individuals, each of whom has provided essential help in the course of my work: Julius P. Barclay, Martin C. and Ruthe R. Battestin, Mary Beaurline, Edmund Berkeley, Jr., Fredson T. Bowers, Jr., Matthew J. Bruccoli, Betty Cauthen, L. Gayle Cooper, Roger Deane, Susan Foard, Anne Freudenberg, Susanne R. Glass, Vesta Gordon, Gillian Kyles, Nancy Mills, Pauline Page, Michael F. Plunkett, Frederick Ribble, George Riser, William H. Runge, David Seaman, Alexander and Charlene M. Sedgwick, Clinton Sisson, Barbara Smith, Mrs. Hugh Spencer, Bill Sublette, G. Thomas Tanselle, Karin Wittenborg, and the staff of the Special Collections Department of the University of Virginia Library. A number of others must be singled out with gratitude for special contributions: Arthur Stocker, Kendon Stubbs, and especially Mrs. John Cook Wyllie, for their reminiscences and their insights into Society history; Edgar Shannon, C. E. Moran, Jr., and Janet Anderson, for information about the University of Virginia Press and the University Press of Virginia; Paul Collinge, who as proprietor of Heartwood Books was crucial to preparation of the list documenting the central activity of the Society, its publishing; Elizabeth Lynch, for her creativity and energy in ferreting out new sources of information; Doris Vander Meulen, who provided early direction with her help in extracting meaning from Society records; and Penelope F. Weiss, for her knowledge of Charlottesville life and assistance with Society files. The history of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia is the story of many people, both in its living and in its telling.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Publications of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1947-1997 by David L. Vander Meulen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In at least one sense bibliography did not begin at home for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, for the Society has never maintained a complete list of its own publications. The fullest record of what in fact has been the Society's chief activity in its first half-century can be found in the annual listings published in Studies in Bibliography , beginning with its initial volume. A number of other sources help to amplify that history. In 1979, stimulated by a gift of Society publications from William B. O'Neal, a former councilor of the Society, the Rare Book Department of the University of Virginia Library attempted to gather all such books and pamphlets and thereby establish a formal record of them; this collection is important as a focused attempt to provide a comprehensive account, but it falls short of completeness even for the first thirty years of the Society, and it was never developed for subsequent ones. For at least half of its life the Society has maintained a card file listing its productions, while the volumes the Society has accumulated in its office have over the years assumed the status of a reference collection and sometimes provide the sole evidence of an item's existence. The collections of individuals likewise prove to be important resources for piecing together the Society's work as a publisher; these in turn are indebted to booksellers particularly those in Charlottesville, who are foremost in recycling the accumulations of early Society members. Some documentary materials about the publications also exist: sporadic holdings of invoices and correspondence in Society files, references in the Secretary's News Sheet or in irregular runs of Society minutes, and the papers of the Society's chief founders. Linton Massey's records were conveyed to the Society on his demise; the Society materials that John Cook Wyllie and Fredson Bowers had in their possession at the time of their deaths passed with other papers to the Special Collections Department of the University Library (thus accounting for the presence of one of the Society's ledger books there instead of with the others in the Society office). It is appropriate that a record of a bibliographical society's publications therefore depends on representatives of its chief constituencies: private and institutional collectors, individual scholars and scholarly organizations, archivists, and booksellers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the following list, two major series, the Secretary's News Sheet and Studies in Bibliography , are listed separately from the Society's other publications. Because the News Sheet is not widely known and has not been covered by indexes, I have noted those contents that have general bibliographical interest. The News Sheet s that were devoted to a single topic were sometimes sold separately (and frequently appear in book dealers' catalogs without identification as part of the series); I have listed these both with the News Sheet s, where the fuller information appears, and with the general publications. Especially during its first decade the Society made available to members various items which technically were not its own productions. Some of these bear such a close connection to the Society, however, that they merit inclusion; accordingly, they have been alphabetized with the other entries for the appropriate years (1947, 1949, 1952, and 1965), but they have been enclosed by braces. Unless otherwise indicated, the publications are hardbound, without dust jackets. Paperbound publications are described as in "covers" (that is, separate pieces of paper, usually thick) or in "wrappers" (a single piece of paper, occasionally thick, continuous around the spine). Beginning in 1966, when members were first offered a standard 20% discount on all Society publications available through the University Press of Virginia, only the price to non-members is ordinarily given. The list includes a few abbreviations of frequently recurring terms: for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia (BSUVa) and the University itself (UVa), the Secretary's News Sheet ( SNS ), Studies in Bibliography ( SB ), Charlottesville (Ch), the University of Virginia Press (UVaP), and the University Press of Virginia (UPVa).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In its first fifty years the Society has produced 53 issues of its Secretary's News Sheet , 50 volumes of Studies in Bibliography (and reprints of 20 of them), and about 175 other publications. Though the amount of information available about the items varies, what is recoverable from archives and from the publications themselves makes clear the way in which the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia has contributed to intellectual life in the second half of the twentieth century and why during that time the name Virginia became an international codeword for bibliographical study.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A History of Studies in Bibliography : The First Fifty Volumes by G. THOMAS TANSELLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The publication of the fiftieth volume of Studies in Bibliography offers an appropriate occasion for looking back over the history of the series, which is central to the history of bibliography in the second half of the twentieth century. When The Library , the journal of the Bibliographical Society in London, reached its fortieth volume in 1929, A. W. Pollard wrote an account of its history that serves to remind us how different were the origins of the two pre-eminent journals of bibliographical scholarship in the English language. 1 Whereas Studies in Bibliography was sponsored from the start by a bibliographical society, The Library began its life in January 1889 (three years before the founding of the Bibliographical Society) as the organ of the Library Association, and it did not become a bibliographical-society publication until 1920, more than three decades later. Nevertheless, there is one essential similarity in their histories: the crucial importance of a single individual. Pollard said that one of his goals in writing the history of The Library was to emphasize the debt owed by "all who are interested in bibliography" to J. Y. W. MacAlister--who (though his own primary interest was librarianship) managed to keep The Library alive as an outlet for bibliographical articles until the Bibliographical Society was (in Pollard's words) "strong enough to be able to take it over and carry it on with success." Similarly, Studies in Bibliography had a founder of vision and determination in Fredson Bowers, and its history is inextricably bound up with his life and personality. 2 As Bowers's many bibliographical activities rapidly made him the leader of his field, so his journal quickly became, in the decade following World War II, the one that best conveyed to many in the bibliographical world the excitement of being at the heart of a developing area of study. During the first half of the twentieth century, The Library occupied that position; and although its standard of excellence did not diminish in the second half of the century, Studies in Bibliography became the place after 1948 where one witnessed most dramatically the exploration of new techniques and new areas. 3 That for most of its half-century it was the product of a single sensibility is one of its remarkable aspects, and one that differentiates it from The Library . MacAlister's role with The Library was to nurture it through hard times, until it could safely be released from his care; Bowers, in contrast, held on to Studies in Bibliography until his death, and its stature is a reflection of his qualities. Pollard ended his article by saying of MacAlister, "He was a great man"; and I begin this account by observing that one manifestation of Fredson Bowers's greatness is the success of Studies in Bibliography .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I When Fredson Bowers in 1945 returned from his wartime naval service to resume his position in the English department at the University of Virginia, he was eager to continue the bibliographical work that he had only just entered into before the war. As matters turned out, by the end of the 1940s he was responsible for two of the landmark events of twentieth-century bibliographical history: the appearance in late December 1948 of the first volume of Studies in Bibliography and the publication a year later of his Principles of Bibliographical Description . These were epochal events because they can be seen, in retrospect, to have affected the course of bibliographical history in a profound way. Studies quickly became one of the major bibliographical journals in the English-speaking world and arguably has been the single most influential one in the second half of the twentieth century; the Principles brought order into the field of descriptive bibliography by offering the first detailed codification of its methodology, and the book--from the moment of its publication--has been the standard guide to the subject. The two events are linked by their common origin in Bowers's own research, primarily his investigations into the printing history of Dekker's plays in preparation for a new scholarly edition of Dekker (a project that formed in his mind in the late 1930s) and his examination of the practices of bibliographical description in anticipation of a detailed bibliography of Restoration English drama (a project that was certainly occupying his mind by 1946 and may well have originated soon after the appearance of the first volume of W. W. Greg's bibliography of pre-Restoration drama in 1939). But the pursuit of these projects did not, of course, require Bowers to found a journal or write an exhaustively comprehensive manual, and a more fundamental explanation of these events lies in his temperament. He had a strong drive to achieve mastery of, and indeed to be a controlling force in, any field that attracted his serious interest; and he had an enormous amount of energy to devote to these goals. To him, it was not enough to embark on a major descriptive bibliography; he first had to systematize the whole field and offer instruction in it through a volume of Principles . Similarly, Studies results from his desire to be personally responsible for encouraging bibliographical work, especially the analysis of physical evidence as a tool for editors. The strength of his urge to be an authority on bibliographical analysis was no doubt formed, at least in part, by the criticisms that attended his first two bibliographical publications--his 1936 and 1937 articles on Dekker in The Library . In both cases his analysis was seriously in error, and in each instance a prominent scholar (Greg the first time, James G. McManaway the second) exposed his erroneous thinking in a later number of The Library . The importance of these rebukes for his bibliographical education cannot be overestimated. His determination to redeem himself produced, almost immediately, an article for The Library on running-title analysis, the very subject in which McManaway had found his knowledge wanting; but he had time for only one more such article before his wartime service, and after that enforced interruption he was undoubtedly all the more impatient to establish his authority in analytical bibliography. One could not argue that a new bibliographical journal was particularly needed at that time, with The Library and the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America receptive to all kinds of bibliographical research. But Bowers, having been forcefully convinced of the powerful results that could come from bibliographical analysis, began to take on the role of proselytizer for the field; and a journal would give him greater effectiveness in persuading scholars to produce more bibliographical articles. That his own university should be known as a center of bibliographical and textual study was a natural element in his program, and he was involved in the formation, early in 1947, of a Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, the story of which has now been told by David L. Vander Meulen. The idea that one of the principal activities of the Society could be the publication of an annual volume of articles was very probably in Bowers's mind from the beginning and was doubtless a topic of discussion during the early months of 1947; but definite plans for such a volume were not formulated until December 1947, just after the collector Linton R. Massey was elected the Society's second president (to succeed his fellow collector Chalmers L. Gemmill). During the next six months enough work on the inaugural volume had been done to permit the inclusion of an announcement in the seventh number (dated June 1948) of the Society's newsletter, the Secretary's News Sheet : The publication of the first of our formal Papers , under the editorship of Dr. Fredson Bowers, may now be definitely announced. Preliminary plans for these were laid in the first days of Mr. Massey's presidency of the Society and were approved by the Council. The printing has been tentatively financed by a generous anonymous donation of $100.00, by the allocation of $300.00 in dues, by a grant (still not formally notified) of $300.00 from a foundation [see the actual figures below], and by the expectation of some sales and advertisements. The plan is to sell the Papers at $2.50 a copy; they come free, of course, to members. A table of contents for the first volume is appended to this News Note. Anticipated publication date: September. In early September a prospectus was circulated by mail both to members and to nonmembers. This attractive flyer was a two-leaf fold of Strathmore Pastelle (so watermarked), each leaf measuring 9 11/16" by 6 3/8" and the final leaf bearing a deckle fore-edge. The first page reproduced the title page, displaying the title Papers of the Bibliographical Society University of Virginia , Bowers's name as editor, the designation "Volume I" for "1948-1949," and the imprint of the Society dated 1948. The second page listed the contents (not in the same typesetting as the actual volume), indicating the titles of the articles, the authors' names, and their institutions (or other identifications). On the third page was shown the opening page of the first article, as an example of the design of the text-pages (though it was not a reproduction of the actual opening page, which included footnotes and fewer lines of main text). And the fourth page provided an order blank in its lower half; the pre-publication price was $2.50 both to members (after their first free copies) and to nonmembers, and the price thereafter was to be $3.50, with the "usual trade discount" to dealers. The upper half of this page, under the heading "Informative Listings," noted that "Non display advertisements of the booktrade" would be accepted at $1.50 per line; they were to be "simply announcements of addresses and specialties of reliable dealers," arranged according to specialty. (See Figures 1-4 for a reproduction of this prospectus.) The volume that appeared in the final days of 1948, printed in December at the William Byrd Press of Richmond, Virginia, in an edition of one thousand copies, contained 209 text-pages bound in heavy cream paper (with flaps folded over, and pasted to, the first and last leaves of the sewn gatherings). An unusually detailed colophon, even specifying the names of the compositors and pressmen, was suggestive of the care that had gone into planning the design; it was also appropriate for a volume whose contents were concerned with the processes of book production in the past: There was an elegance, even a leisurely spatial extravagance, conveyed by the design--beginning with the cover title, in its flowery frame (see Figure 5), and the heft of the book-block, 3/4" thick, with many deckle fore-edges, and continuing with the well-leaded text-pages of Goudy's Monotype Garamont, surrounded by generous margins, and the coated-paper plates. Some readers of the prospectus may have wondered, when looking at the sample article-opening, why the two-inch display of the title of the first article did not include the author's name; with the volume in hand, they would have seen the reason--each article also had its own divisional title leaf, with the title and author's name on the recto in the same frame as that used on the front cover and with "The Bibliographical Society" at the top and "University of Virginia" at the foot. (See Figure 6.) If the physical appearance of the Papers was far removed from the utilitarian typography and layout of many scholarly journals, there was no question about the scholarly nature--indeed, distinction--of the contents, which in fact set the pattern for the succeeding volumes. The contributions were divided into two groups, the eleven articles first, followed by a section of six short "Bibliographical Notes." The pieces ranged widely in subject, from the medieval to the Victorian, and represented various kinds of bibliographical work, including manuscript investigation, publishing history, textual criticism, and the analysis of physical evidence in printed books. It was clear (even without an editorial statement) that Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The roster of contributors also presaged future volumes in its mixture of well- established bibliographical scholars (for example, Curt F. Bühler of the Morgan Library and James G. McManaway of the Folger), little-known assistant professors (such as C. William Miller of Temple and Allan H. Stevenson of the Illinois Institute of Technology), and graduate students (such as Guy A. Battle of Duke). It was natural in the initial volume to draw on local talent, and the parochial nature of the resulting list of contributors is the only way in which the contents of this volume appear uncharacteristic in retrospect. Ten of the seventeen contributors had present or past connections with the University of Virginia--one full Professor (Joseph M. Carrière of the French department), one Associate Professor (Bowers himself), one Assistant Professor (George B. Pace), five of Bowers's graduate students (Mary Virginia Bowman, Jessie Ryon Lucke, James S. Steck, George Walton Williams, and Philip Williams), and two alumni (McManaway and Miller). An important advantage to Bowers in calling on his graduate students was that he could thereby publicize the kind of bibliographical analysis he was encouraging and could send a signal to potential contributors that the journal was especially interested in such work. He published Philip Williams's analysis of compositorial spelling habits in the "Pied Bull" Lear , James Steck's explanation of the usefulness of center rules as bibliographical evidence, and his own note on the role of headline evidence in determining half-sheet imposition. He was also able to include four other forward-looking analytical pieces from outside his university: Battle's note on progressive changes in boxlines, Bühler's experiment in applying headline analysis to incunabula, Giles E. Dawson's identification of eighteenth- century piracies through an arsenal of techniques that included press figures, and--most important of all--the first of Stevenson's brilliant and pioneering expositions of the uses of paper as bibliographical evidence. These seven contributions lent a distinct flavor to the volume and foreshadowed the journal's role in developing analytical bibliography. Just after the first volume appeared, Linton Massey wrote his presidential report (dated 15 January 1949) on the Society's activities for 1948, and he devoted most of one paragraph to the volume: surely the most substantial function of the Society was realized in the final publication of its Papers , edited by Mr. Bowers. This work of permanent worth, extensive scholarship and wide appeal was made possible largely by the grants obtained from the Richmond Area University Center in the amount of $750, although the contribution by the Society itself through an allocation of $700 from its own funds, plus an anonymous contribution of $100 must not be overlooked. As a work of major importance to bibliographers and libraries all copies will doubtless be sold, enabling the Society to continue annually publication of additional volumes. To Mr. Bowers we remain deeply indebted for his enthusiasm, interest, patience, and plain hard work. The phrase "final publication" is a clue to the length and intensity of the discussion and planning that preceded the appearance of the volume. The reviews, though few in number, 4 were equally warm in their praise. Curt Bühler, writing in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America (43 [1949], 227-229), set the tone by saying that the journal "has certainly made a most auspicious beginning." Perhaps the most notable comment in his review was his reference, at this early date, to a "Bowersian school" of bibliographical analysis. Greg, too, in his review, spoke of the University of Virginia as "the centre of a very live and extended school of Bibliography in all its aspects, not least in these highly technical ones that a small band of American scholars have made peculiarly their own" ( Modern Language Review , 45 [1950], 76). William B. Todd, soon to become a regular contributor, praised the "attractiveness of form" as well as the "excellence and diversity of content"; given his own concerns, he was glad to recognize the volume's emphasis on "the presentation and application of techniques of bibliographical analysis," which are of "essential interest" ( Modern Philology , 46 [1948-49], 283-284). R. C. Bald (who had spoken on analytical bibliography at the 1941 English Institute, where Bowers gave a paper on headline analysis) offered the fullest assessment of the significance of the publication (in Modern Language Quarterly , 12 [1951], 370-371): The appearance of this handsomely printed annual is an event of some importance, for which the credit is largely due to the energy and enterprise of the editor. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for the fact that not only has the University of Virginia a bibliographical society (and what other American university has one?), but that a group of colleagues and students have become sufficiently interested in the history and practice of printing to make discoveries and record their findings. Advances in knowledge come most readily under the stimulus of a congenial atmosphere where colleagues are attracted by allied problems, and where hypotheses can be subjected to the criticism of sympathetic co-workers. Of course, not all of these papers have come out of Charlottesville, but enough of them have done so to stamp on the collection the imprint of a group. He added--correctly as it turned out--that the volume "is almost certainly the forerunner of a distinguished series."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Thus launched, the journal proceeded steadily to make its annual appearance, presenting the same mix of bibliographical and textual scholarship. Although The Library had already shown its hospitality to textually oriented bibliographical analysis, Bowers was clearly staking out this area as a particular concern: what one could infer as a direction in the first volume was confirmed in the succeeding ones. (With the second volume, the title became the now familiar Studies in Bibliography -- often referred to in short form as Studies or SB , which I shall use interchangeably--and the old main title, which Bowers thought too parochial, became the subtitle, until it was dropped in 1972.) 5 The second volume (about the same length as the first, containing eleven articles and eight notes) opened indicatively with an article by William B. Todd that sorted out the early editions and issues of Matthew Lewis's The Monk . Bowers had been able to hear an earlier version of this article when it was delivered before the Society on 17 December 1948, and his request to be allowed to consider it for publication can stand as a prominent example of a scene that was repeated many times in later years--Bowers's securing of articles at the time of their oral presentation at conferences. The episode also symbolizes Bowers's willingness--indeed, eagerness--to support the work of unknown scholars, as long as it was of high quality, for Todd was at that time a graduate student (though a mature one, whose graduate work had been delayed by European service during World War II), with no publications to his credit but with a pioneering University of Chicago dissertation in progress on the application of analytical bibliography to eighteenth-century English books. 6 With the publication of Todd's first article coming a year after the publication of Stevenson's first bibliographical article, Bowers's journal had the distinction of introducing two major bibliographical scholars in its first two volumes; and both were loyal to it, Stevenson publishing there four more times and Todd fifteen more (as of 1997). This nurturing of talent not only resulted in distinguished contributions but fostered the identity of the journal with a "school" of bibliographical work and as the place where the most advanced developments in analytical bibliography were likely to be found. The second volume contained other analytical pieces, one of them by Bowers (on type-page width as a clue to compositor identification) and two others by two of Bowers's students who had received their doctorates a few months earlier: both Philip Williams, writing on Troilus and Cressida , and Lawrence G. Starkey, writing on the Cambridge Platform of 1649, dealt with half-sheet imposition, a subject treated by Bowers in the preceding volume. The Starkey piece was notable for being one of the rare instances in which techniques being developed in the study of Renaissance English books were applied to an early American imprint. The volume also treated a field not represented in the first volume, the history of bookbinding, with its inclusion of Eunice Wead's study of early binding stamps, accompanied by six pages of illustrations. The presence of Paul S. Dunkin's piece on the imprint of Dryden's Troilus and Cressida illustrated Bowers's willingness (displayed many times later) to print articles taking different points of view from his own: Dunkin found Bowers's 1949 Harvard Library Bulletin article on this subject unconvincing, and he presented two alternative explanations. 7 Among the bibliographical scholars reappearing from the first volume were Giles Dawson and C. William Miller; among those contributing for the first time were Leslie Hotson and Edwin E. Willoughby. This volume, as W. W. Greg said in his review, "fully maintains . . . the high standard set by the first" ( Modern Language Review , 45 [1950], 524). The Society already had reason to take pride in this accomplishment, and pride is evident in Massey's presidential report for 1949 (dated 11 January 1950): Largely through the means of a generous grant by the Research Committee of the University of Virginia, the Society was able to publish on schedule the second volume of its Studies in Bibliography under the editorship of Mr. Bowers. Volume One had already received wide acclaim, "establishing a new standard in bibliography" as one distinguished critic had ventured to assert. Publication of Volume Two, which is superior to the first in many respects, should vastly enhance the authority and prestige of the Society. Our thanks are due Mr. Bowers for his impeccable scholarship on, and his untiring devotion to, this project. The "authority and prestige" of the Society were indeed publicized shortly thereafter (14 July 1950) by the review in the Times Literary Supplement , which said that with this volume the Society "firmly establishes its sponsorship of a journal which should be on the shelves of every great reference library." Bowers's role in the immediate success of Studies went beyond his astute choice of contributors, for he also entered actively into the shaping of the contributions. Sometimes he offered detailed suggestions for revision, and at other times he made the revisions himself. George Walton Williams, Bowers's graduate student at the time of the second volume, has recently described how Bowers handled his article in that volume: Bowers sought out from students material that was suitable for Studies , and he saw to it that what he printed was made even more suitable than it had been. Reading galley proofs on my second "submission" to Studies , I was surprised to find set up in type in the center of my article paragraphs I had never seen before. When I asked him what had happened, Bowers acknowledged that they were his: he had had a few thoughts on the topic of my paper and had just slipped them into my argument. "That's what a good editor does," he explained. And so his thoughts became part of my article and were published as if mine. Some months after publication of these "joint" thoughts, W. W. Greg commented on them in an article of his; he particularly praised me for certain insights; they were Bowers's insights, of course. By this silent editorial accretion, a graduate student was helped on his way, an article was strengthened, and a volume of Studies was made a better book. Though such supplements were, I am sure, rare and probably were not offered to the work of mature scholars, this one represented the concern for both the student and the scholarly level of the volume. 8 That graduate students were not the only contributors given such assistance is shown by Curt Bühler's experience in connection with the first volume. In his review, Bühler explained why he did not regard it a "breach of good taste" to comment on a publication to which he had contributed: "there may be advantages in these special conditions since I can testify, not only as a contributor but also as a very minor assistant in regard to another paper, to the great care exercised by the editorial board [i.e., Bowers]. It is not too much to say that Professor Bowers virtually rewrote a whole section of my own contribution." The fullest comment on this matter in a review appeared in Philip Gaskell's 1953 review of the first five volumes ( Book Collector , 2: 159-160): Professor Bowers was dissatisfied with many of the current bibliographical journals, feeling that their editors were too ready to accept ill-considered or incomplete contributions. It was his intention that the editor of the Society's chief periodical should be responsible for the quality of its contents to a greater extent than had hitherto been thought desirable. The editor, in other words, would criticize and suggest improvements to papers submitted to him while they were still in manuscript; and he would not publish anything unless he were prepared to answer for its reliability. Whether these remarks had their source in personal experience (since Gaskell was a contributor to the fifth volume) is not clear, but they do suggest the editorial care that was a constant in Bowers's handling of Studies over the next four decades. His willingness to invest time in the journal is suggested by a comment he made in a letter to Linton Massey (14 April 1949) when material for the second volume was being assembled: "These Papers have really got such a hold on my imagination that I take them more seriously than anything else I am doing." Distinguished as the first two volumes were, Studies fully came into its own with the third volume (dated 1950 and designated as for "1950-1951"), which brought together as impressive a group of contributors as any volume of bibliographical essays has ever had. It opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's "Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey," W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Bowers's "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," and Archibald A. Hill's "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts." All four had been delivered at the English Institute on 9 September 1949, and Bowers's chairing of the bibliographical part of the program indicates how these papers came to reside in Studies . 9 He was particularly pleased to secure Greg's essay, which (as he reported to Massey on 16 September 1949) he "had been sweating blood to get." This "magnificent paper," which Bowers had in fact helped Greg to formulate, was to become one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship. Its argument for constructing authorially intended texts of Renaissance drama--by combining wording from revised editions with the punctuation and spelling of early editions--served as the point of departure and often of contention for textual critics throughout the next half-century. 10 Following these articles came pieces by Curt F. Bühler, the bookbinding scholar Ernst Kyriss, Philip Williams, Charlton Hinman (who had written a doctoral dissertation under Bowers's direction in 1941 and who was to become the leading analytical bibliographer with the publication in 1963 of The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare ), C. William Miller, William B. Todd (contributing a basic article on press figures), Rollo G. Silver (who was to become the most distinguished historian of American printing), and J. Albert Robbins. These twelve articles by themselves came to more pages than either of the first two volumes, and they were followed by fourteen bibliographical notes (ranging from Chaucer to Poe) and "A Selective Check List of Bibliographical Scholarship for 1949," which brought the total number of pages to 314, a hundred more than the earlier volumes. It is easy to see why John Carter, writing anonymously in the Times Literary Supplement for 23 March 1951, said that "for the interest and importance of its contributions this third volume of Professor Bowers's periodical must take its place in the first rank of such publications anywhere in the world." When, a year later, the fourth volume appeared in hard covers--grayish blue paper-covered boards with paper labels on the spine and front cover Studies had assumed most of the formal features that would characterize it in the ensuing decades. The first three volumes were bound in stiff paper wrappers--cream for the first volume, medium blue for the second, and reddish orange for the third. Labels on paper-covered boards continued to be the pattern through Volume 19 (1966), after which the casing was cloth, with stamped panels replacing the paper labels. (The only later change in the appearance of the volumes on the shelf was the reduction in leaf size as of Volume 31 [1978] and the consequent shortening of the spine height from 10" to 9 1/2".) With each year's casing in a different color (pair of colors, actually, since the panels differed from the basic cloth), the ever-growing presence of SB on the shelf has been a colorful one from the start (and now amounts to a six-foot display). Inside the volumes, small changes in design took place in the early years: the separate title leaves for major articles were eliminated as of the second volume (a change praised by W. H. Bond, who had found those titles "rather heavy" when he reviewed this volume in the first number of Shakespeare Quarterly in January 1950); 11 and the layout of the major article openings was revised in the second and again in the third volume, at which point it achieved the form that has been followed ever since, with the title and author's name (joined on an intervening line with an italic " by ") placed between a double rule (above) and a single rule (below). (See Figure 7.) The size of the text block on each page has remained virtually the same from the third volume (about 7" x 4 3/4"), though with the reduction of leaf size in 1978 the margins obviously became smaller (and, beginning in the same volume, the layout of footnotes changed from double- to single-column). 12 The Garamont type of the early volumes gave way for several years to Granjon and then, in Volume 9 (1957), to Linotype Baskerville, which has been used ever since; the last identifiable use of Strathmore Pastelle was in Volume 14 (1961), from which point the deckle edges also vanished. 13 As each of the first four volumes shows, halftone illustrations on coated paper were included when useful, and later volumes continued this practice. Although the absence of a colophon in many volumes after the eleventh (1958) makes tracking the printers uncertain, it can be said that in the earlier years the printer was likely to be the William Byrd Press of Richmond, Virginia, and in more recent years Heritage Printers of Charlotte, North Carolina. Most of the printed matter outside the body of articles and notes evolved to its standard form in the first few volumes as well. The major development was the inclusion in Volume 3 of a current checklist of bibliographical scholarship; such a listing became a prominent feature of Studies through Volume 27 (1974), often amounting to twenty double-column pages in small type and conveying a sense that Studies was not simply an annual but a yearbook, despite its policy of not including book reviews. (More on these lists below, in section III.) Another change involved a discontinuation rather than an addition: the elimination of advertising. In the first volume, as promised in the prospectus, there was a section called "Informative Listings"--that is, classified advertisements--following the "Notes on Contributors" (which have continued ever since to be the first element in the end matter). This department did not flourish, with five listings of book dealers in Volume 1 and fourteen in Volume 2. It did not appear thereafter, but in Volumes 4 and 5 display advertising was accepted and placed at the beginning of the volumes. Henry Stevens, Son &amp; Stiles took a full-page advertisement in both volumes (in Volume 4 it faced the title page), and in each volume there were nine half-page advertisements (including some for major firms, such as Berès, Eberstadt, Rosenbach, and Seven Gables). No advertising appeared in any volume after the fifth. Information about the Society, divided between the preliminaries and the final pages in the first three volumes, was interspersed among the advertisements in Volume 4 and entirely moved in Volume 5 to the last pages, where it has remained. One other way--it may be noted in passing--in which the first five volumes were different from those that followed is that they were dated in terms of academic years, which incorporate parts of two calendar years (such as "1948-1949"), whereas beginning with Volume 6 (1954) each volume has been assigned a single calendar year (for more on this point, see footnote 26 below). As for the financial situation of the journal during its first five years, some glimpse is afforded by the Society's balance sheets that were published in the Secretary's News Sheet . Because the Society was bringing out other monographs at the same time and because they were sent without further charge to dues-paying members, it is not realistic to look at the finances of Studies in isolation. But it is clear that the printing costs for Studies were by far the Society's largest expense (running about $2200 for Volumes 2 and 4, $3200 for Volume 5, and $3700 for Volume 3--in a budget where most items were in the low hundreds of dollars, if not below $100); and it is also evident that dues (which increased from $2.50 to $4.50 as of the second volume) and sales to nonmembers would not have covered these costs if there had not been contributions from the University's Research Committee (amounting, for example, to $1500 for Volume 2 and $1700 for Volume 3), the Richmond Area University Center, and--most important of all--a perennial anonymous donor (in fact, Linton Massey). 14 With those contributions, however, the Society did not show a deficit in any of these years, even though none of the thousand-copy editions sold out until later. One would not of course have expected these editions to be exhausted quickly, and the sales of Volume 1 were in fact encouraging; a year after its publication, about half the edition remained in stock, and thus about a hundred copies had been sold to nonmembers-- a figure that does not seem particularly low when one considers that the journal was new and that many institutions received their copies through memberships. The next year 120 more copies of Volume 1 were sold; and by January 1954, just after the publication of Volume 6, the total remaining stock of the first five volumes was 1200--the figures for individual volumes ranging from 163 for Volume 2 to 333 for Volume 4. The scholarly contents of the fourth and fifth volumes reflected the now well-established pattern. The fourth one (for 1951-52) contained nine articles and fifteen notes (totaling 237 pages), with important contributions by several familiar names--McManaway, Todd, Stevenson, Dawson, Pace, Bühler, and Silver-- and major articles by two significant newcomers, G. I. Duthie (on the text of Romeo and Juliet ) and Ralph Green (on early American power printing presses). The fifth volume (for 1952-53), with eleven articles and fourteen notes (totaling 230 pages), 15 opened imaginatively with an essay on "Problems of Literary Executorship" by Norman Holmes Pearson, whose experience with this subject was legendary. It also contained, along with more work by Todd and Bühler, the first contributions from two important bibliographers, Philip Gaskell and Allen T. Hazen (the former with his influential study of eighteenth-century type sizes and the latter with one of his investigations of eighteenth-century paper). Among the comments made in reviews of these volumes was a lament (in the Times Literary Supplement review of the fourth volume on 7 March 1952) that so little work on books after 1800 had appeared in the pages of Studies . Bowers's reply (published in the number for 9 May 1952) gives further hint of his active pursuit of contributions: "we are particularly conscious of an imbalance in our material, and we do our best to beat the bushes for contributions treating more recent books. If we do not print more of such studies it is solely because we are not offered more and cannot secure them by personal solicitation." The spirit conveyed by these first five volumes was effectively caught by Philip Edwards in his review of the fifth one for Shakespeare Quarterly in 1953 (4: 185- 187): "Professor Fredson Bowers has created a new aristocracy in the world of bibliography, and the works he has here collected (so often revealing his own inspiration) have that kind of energy and sense of discovery which moved the Bibliographical Society [of London] in the days of Pollard, Greg, and McKerrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The volumes of Studies that appeared regularly, at the beginning of each year, 16 over the next four decades, continued to display the same broad range of interests, although a few variations in emphasis are discernible. Such shifts did not, however, result from decisions on Bowers's part but rather reflected changing patterns in scholarly research. For example, compositorial and presswork analyses of Elizabethan and Jacobean play quartos were a prominent feature of the early volumes, but by the 1970s they no longer occupied the same dominant position. Studies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books, which Bowers had tried to stimulate early, did begin to increase in the early 1960s, as more scholarly attention was being directed to this period; indeed, a considerable number of the volumes after that time contained more pieces dealing with the past two centuries than with the Renaissance. Work on incunabula and early manuscripts has always held a smaller presence in Studies (though a steady one from the beginning as a result of Bühler's fifteen contributions through 1973); but in the 1980s there was a marked increase in the number of articles on early manuscripts. What may surprise some people is how prominently the eighteenth century has figured in SB 's contents. Even in the early volumes the number of eighteenth-century contributions frequently equalled or surpassed the number devoted to Renaissance drama, and from 1959 on it was usually dominant by a significant margin. All told, the number of articles dealing with the period 1660-1800 is about the same as that concerned with the previous century and a half. One other category that has been a significant presence in Studies , and one that Bowers particularly welcomed, 17 consists of essays on textual theory and bibliographical methodology; though their numbers do not loom large, many of them have been extraordinarily influential. Greg's "Rationale" was the most notable of several such essays in the early volumes, and since 1965 at least one essay of this kind has appeared each year. The presence in Volume 15 (1962) of two articles (the opening two) on the role of computers in textual study shows how alert Bowers was to new developments in their early stages; and the result of this openness is that the full run of Studies includes important examples of all approaches--not only is analytical bibliography there, but the history of publishing and reading (or what is now called "book history" or the social history of books) is present as well. A salient characteristic of the assembled run of Studies is its inclusion of several series of articles by individual scholars--although they were not usually presented as single studies divided into installments, since Bowers felt that in general an annual was not well-suited to serialization. In only eight instances was there explicit serialization, the longest (in seven parts) being Cyrus Hoy's "The Shares of Fletcher and His Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon" (8, 9, 11- 15), 18 which derived from Hoy's graduate work under Bowers . 19 Far more often, what may be regarded as a series consists of independent articles in which a scholar repeatedly attacks a single topic from different angles. Two of the best-known (which began in the earliest volumes, as noted above) are Allan H. Stevenson's series on the analysis of paper (1, 4, 6, 20) and William B. Todd's on the development of analytical techniques for eighteenth-century books (2-4, 6-9, 11, 12, 15, 18). Other significant groupings dealing with the eighteenth century are Friedman's on Goldsmith (5, 11, 13), Miller's on Franklin (11, 14), Bentley's on Blake (12, 19, 34, 41, 49), Eaves and Kimpel's (14, 15, 20) and Van Marter's (26, 28) on Richardson, Battestin's on Fielding (16, 33, 34, 36, 42), Kenny's on Farquhar (25, 28, 32), Woodson's on the 1785 Shakespeare (28, 31, 39), May's on Young (37 [twice], 38, 46), and Brack's on Johnson (40, 45, 47, 48). Not surprisingly, there are several similar groupings relating to compositor determination or presswork and proofreading analysis of Renaissance drama, the most extensive of which is by Robert K. Turner, Jr. (9, 12-15, 18-20, 27, 36); others include those by Hinman (3, 6, 9), Walker (6-9), George Walton Williams (8, 9, 11, the first two in collaboration with Paul L. Cantrell), McKenzie (12, 22, 25, 37), Ferguson (13, 15, 23, 42), Reid (27, 29, 35), Jackson (31, 32, 35, 49), Werstine (35, 41), and Weiss (43-45). One of the rare instances of compositor analysis applied to non-English books is Robert M. Flores's studies of Cervantes (37, 39, 43). Another important series dealing with the Renaissance is Cyprian Blagden's on the Stationers' Company and the seventeenth- century book trade (6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14). The number of such groupings of articles devoted to the medieval period and to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is smaller, but the articles are generally of considerable interest-- such as those on medieval manuscripts by Pace (1, 4, 18, 21, 28), Greetham (37, 38), Hanna (37, 39, 40 [twice], 41-43, 48, 49), and Wright (39, 42); that on incunables by Rhodes (6-8, 11, 26, 34), as well as the long series by Bühler, mentioned earlier; and those by Altick (6, 11, 22, 39) and Scott Bennett (25, 29) on nineteenth-century publishing, West on twentieth-century publishing (26, 35, 36, 45), Shannon on Tennyson (13, 32, 34, 38, the second and fourth jointly with Ricks), Bruccoli on Fitzgerald (9, 13, 16, 17), Scholes on Joyce (15-17), and Brodsky on Faulkner (33, 34, 36-41, the first in collabortion with Robert W. Hamblin). Of all the writers who have contributed more than once or twice to SB , there are two who supplied far more material than any others to the first fifty volumes: Fredson Bowers and I. Although Bowers could have published his own work in every volume (for he certainly had articles available), he chose to include himself in only half the volumes he edited (twenty-two out of forty-four). 20 And one can hardly complain about his including himself that often, since many of his articles are among the most significant that have appeared in Studies . 21 One could argue that his most influential contribution was one of the shortest, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors" (17), which supplied the underpinning for the Center for Editions of American Authors and the whole movement to apply Greg's "Rationale" to the editing of nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature. Other widely cited general articles are his "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems" (3), which, coming in 1950, helped set the stage for the kinds of editions he soon began to produce and inspire; "Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants" (29), which described in detail a system for reporting manuscripts, worked out in connection with his William James edition; and "Greg's `Rationale of Copy-Text' Revisited" (31), in which Bowers acknowledged some limitations in Greg's approach. Several of his articles, such as the one on Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (26), were by-products of his own editions; but the editing of Shakespeare (which he did not engage in himself, except for his Penguin edition of Merry Wives of Windsor ) was the subject to which he turned most often in the SB pieces, with significant studies of Hamlet (7, 8) and All's Well (32), along with some more general essays (6, 19, 33-35, 43). As for my contributions, I first published a short note on Poe in 1963 (16), and beginning with the next volume I have published a full article every year (plus another short note in Volume 23). Most of my articles have dealt with one or the other of two subjects, descriptive bibliography (eleven items) or editorial theory (twelve items), but I have touched on some other general topics, such as the literature of American publishing history (18), press figures (19), copyright records (22), the relation of bibliography and science (27), the history of bibliography (41), and the limitations of reproductions (42). I leave it to others to comment on the significance of these essays, but I can say that they have given SB a greater concentration on theory and method than it would otherwise have had. And some of them have been among the more widely cited SB articles--"The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention" (29), "The Editing of Historical Documents" (31), "A Sample Bibliographical Description with Commentary" (40), and "Reproductions and Scholarship" (42), for example. The most significant articles in Studies --it is important to add--have not come exclusively from writers who have published there repeatedly. The prime example is of course "The Rationale of Copy-Text," which was Greg's only contribution. Similarly, Bruce Harkness has so far published only one note and one article in SB , but the article was "Bibliography and the Novelistic Fallacy" (12), which has been often cited as a classic statement of the need for reliable texts of novels. Edwin Wolf 2nd made a single appearance in Studies , "Historical Grist for the Bibliographical Mill" (25), but it was an extremely important argument for paying more attention to bibliographical analysis in the examination of nonliterary Americana--an argument that has not yet been sufficiently heeded. Two of the best theoretical examinations of stemmatic analysis were by one-time contributors, Antonín Hrubý (18) and Michael Weitzman (38). Robert Halsband's one article, "Editing the Letters of Letter-Writers" (11), though now dated, was for years the most prominent discussion of this topic; Peter Davison's one article so far, "Science, Method, and the Textual Critic" (25), is an outstanding treatment of a difficult subject; Ross Atkinson's single article thus far, "An Application of Semiotics to the Definition of Bibliography" (33), is a stimulating approach to the perennial question of how to define the field; R. W. Franklin's one article so far is a landmark study of Emily Dickinson's fascicles (36); and one of David L. Vander Meulen's two contributions during Bowers's editorship, "The Identification of Paper without Watermarks: The Example of Pope's Dunciad " (37), is a major advance in the bibliographical analysis of paper (and a natural extension of Stevenson's work, first published in the initial volume of Studies ). 22 Any list of the most important articles in Studies would always include D. F. McKenzie's "Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices" (22). (It was the third of McKenzie's five contributions thus far, all on seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century printing.) This article pointed out questionable statements in a number of the articles of bibliographical analysis (including some of Bowers's own) that had been published (in SB and elsewhere) over the previous two decades and suggested that perhaps the time had come to spend more effort uncovering the data in printers' records than in attempting to deduce printing history from clues in printed matter. Inductive work, such as analytical bibliography, always involves uncertainties, but McKenzie had located instances where incautious or unwarranted conclusions had been drawn. It was salutary to have these instances publicized, but whether their existence called the whole field into question was of course a different matter. McKenzie, who had previously contributed a good example of bibliographical analysis to SB (a compositorial study of the second quarto of The Merchant of Venice in Volume 12) , may not have intended to suggest that analytical bibliography should be abandoned; but the article lent itself easily to such an interpretation, 23 and there were many who wished to read it that way, having already felt that the postwar excitement over bibliographical analysis had gotten out of hand. McKenzie's article was not the sole reason for the decline in interest in analytical bibliography since then, but it did play a role. It fit the temper of the times, which in literary studies was beginning to turn away from a concern with authorial meanings and toward a view of texts as social products. Analytical bibliography is not, of course, tied to authorial intention; but since it had largely been developed by editors interested in such intentions, the two were associated by many people and thus lost favor together. At the time of "Printers of the Mind," McKenzie had not yet published any of his arguments for the "sociology of texts," but it is not surprising that his writing moved in that direction. His SB article stands as a key document of a major turning-point in textual criticism. It also reflects three other characteristics of SB , besides the journal's consistency in publishing seminal articles. One is that SB has always been hospitable to long essays, when their length is justified (Bowers did not hesitate to ask authors to make cuts). In addition to McKenzie's 75-page contribution, one thinks--for example--of Mason Tung's 72-page article on Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes (29), or Bowers's fifty-three pages on the recording of manuscript alterations (29), or Adrian Weiss's seventy pages on font analysis (43), or my sixty-page surveys of textual scholarship (28, 44). A second characteristic symbolized by the McKenzie article is Bowers's willingness to publish articles with which he personally disagreed. He knew McKenzie's article was important, and he printed it, even though he could not endorse its tone or its conclusion, as he later stated in print. 24 In one early volume (13), he made a point of placing side by side two articles of opposed viewpoints (John Russell Brown's "The Rationale of Old Spelling Editions . . ." and Arthur Brown's ". . . A Rejoinder"), only the second of which he agreed with. But usually articles he demurred at were allowed to stand on their own--though occasionally he printed a rebuttal later and was even tempted to supply it himself. When I sent him a short piece critical of Paul Baender's note on copy-text (22), he not only printed it the next year but told me that, before my note arrived, he had planned to write such a reply himself. As for responding to McKenzie, both Peter Davison's and my articles on "science" (25, 27), at least in part, served this function. A third characteristic of SB that one is reminded of by McKenzie's appearance is Bowers's efforts to enlist foreign scholars as contributors. Although few appeared in the first five volumes, the sixth volume contained work by five British scholars, and the number from the United Kingdom has remained strong ever since, along with good representation in later years from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. But the image of Studies as an international forum owes less to numbers than to the quality of the foreign contributions. Two of the most momentous of SB articles, after all, were by foreigners, Greg and McKenzie. Besides those pieces, SB has published important work by--to name only a few--Alice Walker, Philip Gaskell, Cyprian Blagden, Harold Jenkins, Dennis E. Rhodes, Peter Davison, Keith I. D. Maslen, and B. J. McMullin. In the past two decades or so, European textual scholars have been particularly drawn to the study of authors' revisions and independent versions of works, and Studies has been the best place in the English-speaking world to learn about these developments. As early as 1975, Bowers published Hans Zeller's "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," which has been repeatedly cited as the best introduction in English to the German approach. And Volume 41 (1988) included translated essays by one French textual critic (Louis Hay) and three German ones (Klaus Hurlebusch, Gerhard Neumann, and Siegfried Scheibe), although Bowers was not himself attracted to the study of versions (or to the theorizing) represented by their articles. 25 It is perhaps ironic that these papers had been offered at a conference celebrating Bowers's eightieth birthday, but it is entirely characteristic of him to have admitted them to Studies , recognizing that they reflect a significant movement. Bowers's openness to the best textual and bibliographical work being done anywhere in the world, even when it challenged his own firmly held beliefs, gave Studies an air of vitality and excitement year after year. The only anomalous volume in the whole run of Studies is Volume 10, dated 1957, which consists entirely of checklists of bibliographical scholarship. It is labeled "Decennial Extra Volume" on the title page, and indeed subscribers did receive two volumes within the year, for Volume 9 is also dated 1957. 26 The tenth volume contains reprints of the checklists for 1949 through 1954 that had appeared in Volumes 3-8 of Studies , along with the first publication of the list for 1955, which had not been included in Volume 9. (There was an explanation in Volume 9 that this list would appear in "the extra volume X of these Studies celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Society.") To these seven lists (totaling 130 pages) was added a sixty-page index of authors and (according to Anne Freudenberg's preface) "the specific or general subject of each item in the check lists as revealed in the title ." Limited as it is, this index (with such entries as "Compositors," "Engravings," "Paper," "Press figures," and "Printing") is extremely useful in providing access to the lists, for they had not been individually indexed. The lists had thus not been easy to consult, despite a modest attempt at classification: each list had been simply divided into two parts, "Incunabula and Early Renaissance" 27 and "Later Renaissance to the Present," with the latter further subdivided into a section on enumerations and one on discursive articles and books (and these two sections had their own subheadings, "English and General" and "United States"). The "Incunabula" part was the work of Rudolf Hirsch; the part on "Later Renaissance to the Present" was in the first instance (for 1949) compiled by Lucy Clark and Fredson Bowers, but beginning with the second list the compiler was Howell J. Heaney. The 1957 preface, echoing the prefatory note to the first "Selective Check List," described the scope as "not intended to include catalogs of secondary publications, or other library aids, but to note selected primary investigations concerned with all phases of bibliographical scholarship." These lists, despite their selectivity, did serve a significant function, particularly in calling to the attention of the bibliographically minded readers of Studies some of the work on analytical bibliography appearing elsewhere. 28 Although many of the items of course reappeared in the more comprehensive listings of current scholarship (especially on literature), their presence in a smaller specialized list made them easier to locate, particularly after the index provided improved access by bibliographical topics. In the 1957 volume the lists were presented as an ongoing "annual department," and further such volumes, with cumulative indexes, were promised. Accordingly, the next checklist, the one for 1956, when published in Volume 11 (1958), was subtitled "Series B"; after seven checklists had been published (the same number that were brought together in Volume 10), Series B was considered complete, and in 1966 a volume bringing together the lists for 1956-62 was indeed published, with a cumulative index. But the idea of including volumes of reprinted checklists in the numbered sequence of volumes of Studies was now seen as mistaken, and the volume was published separately by the Society, with the compilers' names (Heaney and Hirsch) on the title page. 29 (Their preface, by the way, makes clear that it was their policy to list all articles, regardless of subject, appearing in the publications of six bibliographical societies-- London, Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, America, and Virginia.) A "Series C" (with Derek A. Clarke replacing Rudolf Hirsch as compiler of the "Incunabula" section) duly began with the list for 1963, in Volume 18 (1965), and continued for ten years--not seven, as with the previous two series. But no cumulated volume was ever published, and no further checklists appeared after the one for 1972 in Volume 27 (1974). The next year there was a brief announcement at the end of the last page of text: "In view of the duplication that would result with the proposals in the Annual Bibliography of the History of the Printed Book and Libraries to expand its coverage with the fourth volume, of 1973, the Society's Annual Selective Checklist has been discontinued as of this issue." The Annual Bibliography referred to, which designated itself as " ABHB ," was published at The Hague under the general editorship of Hendrik D. L. Vervliet for the Committee on Rare and Precious Books and Documents of the International Federation of Library Associations; and Vervliet was then in the process of building up a group of contributors to report on work published in their countries. It is true that the fourth volume of ABHB , covering 1973 (and published in 1975), did include the United States for the first time, and the contributors of American entries were Heaney and Hirsch, who had produced most of the SB lists. Theoretically, therefore, ABHB did render the SB lists unnecessary. But the role of analytical bibliography in printing history was not as clear to all the contributors as it was to Heaney and Hirsch, and the field that had been so well represented in the SB lists had a rather marginal existence in ABHB . The situation is symbolized in the 1973 volume of ABHB by the placement of T. H. Howard-Hill's SB article on "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies" (26) in the section entitled "Relation to Secondary Subjects." Nevertheless, despite the different understanding of bibliography that underlay the two publications, Bowers's decision to end the SB lists has in the long run been vindicated: not only was some duplication of effort avoided on an annual basis, but also the creation of newer tools with more thorough coverage and superior indexing--such as the electronic form of the Modern Language Association's cumulated annual listings--has meant that the SB checklists would no longer be fulfilling the vital function they once served. 30 If Volume 10 of Studies stands out from the series by consisting entirely of checklists, one other volume calls attention to itself by the presence in it of a foreword and a parody. Volume 20 (1967) took notice of the Society's twentieth anniversary in two ways. First, there was a "Foreword" made up of two messages, the first from Sir Frank Francis, director of the British Museum and immediate past president of the Bibliographical Society in London, and the second from Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., president of the University of Virginia. Both were friends of Bowers, and--although they acknowledged the important support of loyal Society members--they quite properly recognized that the driving force behind the success of Studies was Bowers himself. Francis, after noting that the Virginia organization had been formed by "a group of dedicated individuals banded together" (wording reminiscent of his phrase "a sense of common adventure," which he had used in the London society's 1945 jubilee volume to describe the early days of the older society), went on to say that "in this case" a journal "sprang into being full-grown and fully armed, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter, whose thunderbolts she wielded from time to time." The identity of Jupiter was obvious: "the Society with the prestige it now enjoys and the great success it has had is substantially the image of its Editor, whose industry and monumental achievements in analytical bibliography are the admiration of bibliographers." As "spokesman" of the London society, Francis observed that Bowers had published "some of his earliest work in bibliography" in that society's journal, The Library ; Francis concluded, "I like to think that the rigidly uncompromising standards which he has applied so successfully are in part at least the fruits of his association with our members." Shannon, in his comments, paid particular attention to the "supporting structure" of the society but only after declaring, "The renown of Studies in Bibliography , and of the senior editor who has fulfilled that responsibility from the initial volume, requires no elaboration or other encomium." The other unusual aspect of Volume 20, besides this double "Foreword," was the nature of the opening article. Bowers clearly hoped to avoid making the celebratory occasion excessively solemn, and--instead of offering any comment of his own--he printed as the first piece (that is, immediately following the two congratulatory messages) a parody of textual and explicatory criticism written by the poet John Frederick Nims, a friend of the Bowerses. "The Greatest English Lyric?--A New Reading of Joe E. Skilmer's `Therese'" engages in "deep reading" to uncover the "substruct" of "riches" beneath the text of Joyce Kilmer's "Trees"--in the course of which a "brilliantly reasoned" analysis is attributed to Bowers, who is said to be working on a "monumental fifty-volume edition of Skilmer." The piece remains fresh and mischievously amusing. If Bowers wanted to show that he was not taking the twentieth anniversary too seriously, he never after that paused to take any notice whatever of an anniversary. The twentieth volume of Studies did attract attention, however, most notably in the form of a full-page article in the Times Literary Supplement entitled "Bibliography and Dr. Bowers" (27 April 1967). It began by referring to the time when "the first volume of the society's Papers came forth to astonish all the bibliographers of Europe." "The new periodical," it continued, "rapidly established an authority rivalling that of The Library , and it has maintained its distinguished position ever since; by now every bibliographer is in its debt." The article first surveyed the physical changes in the early volumes ("the bibliography of the series itself"); the frequency of such changes prompted the writer to remark, "No doubt the editor uses successive volumes as examples for his classes in bibliographical description." Then the contents of the anniversary volume were judiciously assessed, sometimes admiringly (Allan Stevenson's essay "offers another graceful demonstration of his persistence and art") and sometimes complainingly (Patricia Hernlund's piece is symptomatic of "a weakness in American bibliography as a whole: strong as the Americans are in textual theory and in analytical technique, few even of the most expert among them have a thorough theoretical and practical knowledge of the printing technology of their periods"). The criticisms (including the wish that Studies included book reviews) did not prevent the writer from concluding, "The whole number reflects credit upon the society, and in particular upon its chief editor." (Since Bowers's name is not attached to any article in the volume, the writer was led to wonder whether "it be he who galumphs through a parody of textual criticism under the name of J. F. Nims.") The latter part of the article examined Bowers's 1966 Clark Library address on "Bibliography and Restoration Drama" (published with a lecture of Lyle H. Wright's in a pamphlet entitled simply Bibliography ), as a way of summarizing and reconsidering his ideas on the scope and techniques of descriptive bibliography. But the occasion for this reconsideration was clearly the SB anniversary. 31 Many other volumes of SB were noticed in the Times Literary Supplement in the days of its bibliographical "back page," which regularly covered current numbers of bibliographical journals. Indeed, the TLS did not miss a single volume in the first eighteen and reviewed most of the succeeding ten volumes. These reviews often contained phrases like "The sustained excellence of Professor Bowers's journal" (16 April 1954) and statements to the effect that SB "contains, as we have come to expect, a very large proportion of the research now being undertaken in this subject" (11 May 1956). One of the most amusingly complimentary of the TLS reviews (on 5 May 1957) dealt with Volume 9; the opening and closing paragraphs give the flavor: For his latest addition to an impressive series, Professor Bowers has cast his net wider but no less deeply. The standards of professional seriousness observed (though there is no contribution of his own here) and exacted from his contributors by the Great Cham of American bibliography have made these annual volumes required reading wherever bibliography is taken seriously; and if anyone complains that they are not always easy reading, he convicts himself, not their editor. . . . The citizens of the Old Dominion, which this year celebrates the 350th anniversary of the landing of the first English settlers at Jamestown, will no doubt be too busy with fireworks to pay much attention to the bibliographical power-house developing in their State University. But they can be proud of its products, and of its influence. The importance of these reviews in publicizing the contents of SB was considerable, both because of the large and wide readership of the TLS and because the TLS was practically the only publication (other than a few annuals) that systematically examined the contents of bibliographical journals. Indeed, scholarly journals in any field are rarely reviewed, and no doubt it was SB 's physical appearance--which made it look like a "book"--that caused a number of book-review editors to assign it for review. SB was thus more fortunate than most journals in the number of times its contents were analyzed in reviews in major journals--and by major scholars. The typical review inevitably consisted of brief comments on some of the articles, with an introductory and closing remark on "the high standard one has come to expect." 32 But the reviews were rarely perfunctory, and the reputation of the series attracted prominent scholars as reviewers. Some of them wrote repeatedly on SB for the same few journals. In the early years, for example, Greg wrote a succession of reviews for Modern Language Review (1-4), as did Arthur Brown (5, 6/7, 11) and A. N. L. Munby (8, 9, 13-15, 17-19); Herbert Davis for a time was a regular reviewer of SB for Review of English Studies (4, 7, 8, 11, 13), as was Arthur Brown (9, 14, 15); F. C. Francis reviewed more than one volume for The Library (2/3, 4/5), and so did J. C. T. Oates (9, 12) and Robert Donaldson (15, 18-23); and Philip Edwards reviewed several volumes for Shakespeare Quarterly (5, 6, 11), as did D. G. Neill for The Book Collector (9, 11-15). These were the journals that gave most attention to SB , and still other notable reviewers commented on SB occasionally in their pages, as when James Kinsley reviewed Volume 5 in Review of English Studies , or when John Crow, in his inimitable fashion, discussed Volume 3 in Shakespeare Quarterly and Volume 18 in The Book Collector , or when Alice Walker reviewed Volume 11, D. F. McKenzie Volume 13, and Kenneth Povey Volume 14 in The Library . There was also considerable foreign publicity for Studies , not only in the form of occasional notices in such journals as Das Antiquariat , Anuario bibliografico cubano , Bokvånnen , Nordisk Tidskrift för Bok- och Biblioteksväsen , and Trimestre bibliografico but also through repeated comments by Sigfred Taubert in Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel (e.g., 11, 12, 14, 16-18) and Louis Bonnerot in Etudes anglaises (e.g., 6, 7/11, 13/15, 16/18). Although the reviews always contained a great deal of praise, they not infrequently registered complaints as well. This being a journal concerned with bookmaking practices, even the unfortunate frequency of typographical errors became a topic for discussion. The quality of the writing was another target for several reviewers over the years. Arthur Brown, when reviewing Volumes 6 and 7, praised Harold Jenkins's article as a model of "the kind of civilized writing which is, it seems, all too frequently disdained by the twentieth- century scholar," and he then added, "I do wish that bibliographers in general . . . would make an effort to avoid the twin vices of smugness and formlessness" ( Modern Language Review , 50 [1955], 523- 524). Herbert Davis can be taken as the spokesman for a number of reviewers when (in his review of Volume 11 in Review of English Studies , n.s., 10 [1959], 435-437) he objected to the extended "unwinding of these tortuous arguments . . . burdened by cautionary phrases" and suggested that Bowers "deal a little more rigorously with his contributors," many of whom "have not time to let their heady liquor settle and clarify itself." A critical attitude toward analytical bibliography also surfaced in a number of reviews. An earlier review of Davis's (on Volume 7 in Review of English Studies , n.s., 8 [1957], 215-217) suggested that the "growing interest" in compositor study might be thought "a dangerous tendency rather like that attacked by A. E. Housman in his strictures upon those textual critics who gave up the attempt to understand the mind of their author, and devoted themselves entirely to a study of the habits of scribes." Davis did recognize the contributions that compositor study had made, and he found Alice Walker's work reassuring, but he used Bowers's article on the second quarto of Hamlet as "an illustration of possible dangers in building up arguments based on what must be partly conjectural accounts of what actually took place in the printing-house." Leo Kirschbaum, writing the same year but reviewing Volume 9 ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 8 [1957], 544-546), asked, "of what use has this servant [i.e., analytical bibliography], which tends to act like a tyrant, been to the scholar- critic?" He answered "not very much" and wondered "whether it will ever be very much, despite all its pretensions." This review was one of several salvos that Kirschbaum issued against the "Bowers school" at this time, but it serves here to show that the controversies surrounding analytical bibliography were not absent from the reviews, even a decade before McKenzie's "Printers of the Mind." Such reviews, indeed, helped to place SB at the center of its field, though they constituted only a part of the commentary: one must remember that a fuller guide to the influence of a journal (if a harder one to measure) is the use made of its articles in later scholarship. In more recent years Studies has not received as many reviews; but anyone who reads widely in the field knows that its presence has become even more prominent, as the volumes have mounted up and as more and more SB articles have been found indispensable by a wide variety of scholars. 33</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV A new era in the annals of Studies opened with Volume 46 (1993), for that volume marked the beginning of David L. Vander Meulen's editorship. That the years since then can be called a new era does not point to any difference of approach that Vander Meulen has brought to the position but only signals the fact that a change of editorship after forty-five years is obviously a major event in the life of any journal. Not that many journals have ever experienced such an event, for an editorial tenure of that length is as rare among scholarly journals as it is among general-circulation periodicals. And when the editor is also one of the great figures in a field, the situation is rarer still. If one tries to think of other major bibliographical scholars who have edited journals for long periods, one is bound to think first, in the English-speaking world, of R. B. McKerrow, who founded the Review of English Studies and edited it for fifteen years, and A. W. Pollard, who edited The Library for thirty-one years. But Bowers's forty-five-year editorship far surpassed both their terms--indeed, almost equaling the two combined. Because Bowers at the same time published a large body of his own scholarship--some three million words, plus sixty-eight volumes of editions--and was a busy teacher and administrator, it is sometimes assumed that he spent little time on Studies . Nothing could be farther from the truth: Bowers was in fact an extremely active journal editor. No distinguished journal can exist without constant attention, and the SB editorship was a basic fact of Bowers's life, a continuous and demanding activity that existed alongside his other projects. His shaping hand is reflected throughout the published contents, as a result of his solicitation of articles and his treatment of them after he received them. Of course, the character of the journal derives, even more fundamentally, from his receptiveness to all kinds of work. He conducted SB with an open-mindedness that surprised some people, who thought that the assertiveness of his own writing indicated a lack of openness to other points of view. But just as the uncompromising quality of his public statements emerged from a principled and reasoned position, not from personal pique or stubbornness, so his standards for SB concerned cogency and scholarly responsibility, not a particular line of thinking. But what was time-consuming about this approach was the way he worked with potential contributors. Solicitation of articles, which he engaged in continually, 34 was of course a compliment and an incentive to the authors; but equally important was his recognition of bibliographical talent at an early stage and his supportive (if rigorous) criticisms that helped to give both reassurance and direction to those possessing it. He frequently invited his graduate students to contribute to Studies , when he saw that they had appropriate material, and thus helped to launch several of them on notable careers as publishing scholars. As for those who were not his students, Bowers's record of discovering talent extended from Allan Stevenson and William Todd, in the first two volumes, to Adrian Weiss, whose exciting and innovative investigations of Renaissance type fonts appeared in the final three volumes that Bowers oversaw. In the last of them, which was published nine months after Bowers's death, Weiss movingly recorded his indebtedness to Bowers: I dedicate this paper to the memory of Fredson Bowers whose death on 11 April 1991 deprived the bibliographical world of its guiding force. It is a great personal loss as well. He gave validity to my research when I had no idea that it was anything more than an accumulation of amusing bibliographical details. The idea of formulating my methods of analysis was entirely his. Without that guidance it would all have amounted to nothing. His criticisms of my thinking and writing were blunt but respectful of my efforts which, at times, fell far short of the mark. For this I am grateful. Sit tibi terra levis . Weiss gave voice to sentiments that had been felt by many earlier contributors as well. I can testify myself to the friendly support that underlay his letters to me, from the time of our first correspondence about SB in 1962; his encouraging inquiries (and, sometimes, tentative hints) regarding my work in progress were as important to me as his sensitive and shrewd comments on the work actually submitted. I cannot imagine being read by a more responsive and understanding reader, or receiving more constructive and meaningful encouragement; and I know that my feelings are shared by many others. It seems apparent that a considerable portion of the contents of SB might never have existed without Bowers's perceptively chosen words at the right moments. Once an article was received, Bowers gave it immediate and detailed scrutiny. The easy way in which prose flowed forth profusely from him enabled him to give copious advice, in the form of extremely long letters. It was not uncommon for potential contributors to receive letters of six, eight, ten, or more single-spaced--and sometimes unparagraphed--pages (often with a postscript in his notoriously difficult handwriting). Frequently such letters were the by-products of the actual process of reading: he would go through articles at the typewriter and type out a running commentary as he read. This procedure sometimes resulted in his having to say, at some later place in a letter, that an earlier point he had made should now be disregarded; but even these adjustments of opinion were useful to the authors, who were thus alerted to spots in their articles that might at first be misleading or misunderstood. The authors always knew that their work was receiving Bowers's concentrated attention and that his suggestions grew out of an understanding of--and respect for--what they were trying to accomplish. 35 The appreciative comments of Curt Bühler and George Walton Williams, quoted above, are suggestive of the gratitude felt by many contributors. The intensive labor of Bowers's style of editorship was borne largely by Bowers himself. Before Vander Meulen's arrival in Charlottesville, only one assistant was recorded on SB title pages: L. A. Beaurline, a member of the Virginia English department, was named there in Volumes 17 through 27 (1964-74), first as Assistant Editor (1964-65) and then as Associate Editor (1966-74). And three other names made brief appearances as "Assistants to the Editor" in 1974-77, listed among the Society's officers at the back of the volumes. 36 When Bowers retired from the English department in 1975 at the age of seventy, he had made no arrangements for a successor as editor, and in any case he wished to continue editing the journal. But finding a successor was much on his mind in the years that followed. It happened that he met David Vander Meulen in the North Library of the British Museum in the spring of 1978 and, seeing the kind of work Vander Meulen was doing, invited him to submit the results of his research to SB . After a few years, Vander Meulen did send Bowers two pieces that derived from his work for a remarkable 1981 dissertation at the University of Wisconsin. The dissertation was a descriptive bibliography of Pope's Dunciad from 1728 to 1751, and it set new standards for bibliographical description, both in thoroughness and in the development and use of new techniques. Bowers published the two articles in Volumes 35 and 37 (1982 and 1984) and recognized that the dissertation was a comparable landmark to William B. Todd's Chicago dissertation some three decades before, in the early days of SB . Vander Meulen thus joined the distinguished circle of young scholars who had benefited from Bowers's encouragement at significant moments in their lives. 37 Bowers suggested to the English department that Vander Meulen be interviewed for a position; an offer was made in December 1983, and Vander Meulen agreed to join the department in the autumn of 1984. It was understood that part of Vander Meulen's time was to be spent assisting Bowers with Studies , and it did not take Bowers long to see that Vander Meulen, with his thorough knowledge of bibliographical and textual work and his judiciousness, would be an ideal successor. Bowers continued as editor until his death in the spring of 1991, and Vander Meulen thus had the opportunity of working with him for nearly seven years, gradually taking over many of the responsibilities for reading submitted articles and seeing the volumes through the press. Bowers's increasing reliance on Vander Meulen was reflected in the way Vander Meulen's name was reported in print. Although his name did not appear in Volume 38 (1985), the first one with which he was associated, it was given on the copyright pages of the next two volumes, first as "Assistant to the Editor" (39) and then as "Assistant Editor" (40). Beginning with the next volume (41), his name moved to the title page beneath Bowers's, first labeled "Assistant Editor" (41-43) and then "Associate Editor" (44-45). Volume 45, which appeared early in 1992 and was thus the first to come out after Bowers's death, contained the following announcement on the recto of the leaf preceding the opening of the first article: The Council of the Bibliographical Society announces with regret that Fredson Bowers died on April 11, 1991. The present volume of Studies in Bibliography was substantially complete before his death; the next one will contain a survey of his career. The Society has appointed David L. Vander Meulen as the new editor of Studies . Irby B. Cauthen, Jr. President Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia Most of the editorial work for that volume was handled by Vander Meulen, but Bowers's name was allowed to remain as editor, and it was the next volume (46) in which Vander Meulen was first named as editor on the title page. At the top of the copyright page of Volume 46, the following appeared: Founding Editor Fredson Bowers (1905-1991) This volume, the first not edited by him, is dedicated to his memory. 38 Since that time Bowers's name has continued to be recorded as "Founding Editor" on the copyright page, and beginning with Volume 48 (1995) there is another listing below it: " Assistant to the Editor / Elizabeth Lynch." The volume dedicated to Bowers (46) contains the "survey of his career" promised in the preceding volume, in the form of my 154-page monograph entitled "The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers," which not only discusses his professional life but presents a considerable amount of information about his personal life as well. In a journal known for its lengthy articles, it is perhaps fitting that the longest of all should have been devoted to Bowers himself. This biography was followed by a thirty-page checklist of Bowers's published work and a two-page chronology of his career, both prepared by Martin Battestin on the basis of Bowers's own versions that had appeared in his 1975 volume of collected essays. (The biography, checklist, and chronology, along with a preface by Vander Meulen and an index, were also published by the Society as a separate hard-cover volume.) The presence of all this material made Volume 46 distinctive, but in other respects it and the succeeding volumes under Vander Meulen's editorship have included the same kinds of articles that have characterized the journal from the beginning. Several of the same contributors, such as MacD. P. Jackson, G. E. Bentley, Jr., and Ralph Hanna III, have reappeared in these volumes, and the newcomers have included such a major figure as Paul Needham. Some of the particularly important articles have indeed been by first-time contributors, such as--to name only two--Ann R. Meyer's on the editing of King Lear (47) and Maura Ives's on the bibliographical description of periodicals (49). Vander Meulen is clearly continuing the tradition of being hospitable to all kinds of bibliographical scholarship. A new interest that one may discern in the most recent five volumes is an effort to promote work on the history of bibliography, especially in the form of biographical studies of important bibliographers. 39 My biography of Bowers has been followed by an illuminating discussion of Allan Stevenson by Paul Needham (47) and a graceful memoir of J. D. Fleeman by David Fairer (48). The latter piece is in fact part of a series of "Essays in Honor of J. D. Fleeman," as the table of contents for Volume 48 is headed. All but two of the articles in the volume are part of this grouping, which constitutes the first instance in which a volume of Studies has been designed as a Festschrift or has had an overall theme. Given SB 's strong record in eighteenth-century studies and its new interest in biography, a Festschrift for a distinguished bibliographer of Samuel Johnson seems entirely in order. And not surprisingly the list of contributors to Volume 48 is one of the most stellar in the history of the journal, consisting of James McLaverty, O M Brack, Jr., Keith Maslen, Hugh Amory, James E. Tierney, Gwin J. Kolb, Robert DeMaria, Jr., Anne McDermott, Donald D. Eddy, Donald W. Nichol, Thomas F. Bonnell, Ann Bowden, William B. Todd, Pamela Dalziel, and B. J. McMullin. Vander Meulen's five volumes have thus shown some innovation, but strictly within the established tradition: the character of the series has been maintained. I hope some idea of that character has been conveyed in the preceding pages, and perhaps a brief statistical retrospect is in order at this point. Over the past half-century, Studies has published the work of 509 writers, who have contributed 930 pieces filling 13,682 pages. 40 Twenty writers have contributed more than five times: G. Thomas Tanselle 36 Arthur Sherbo 28 Fredson Bowers 25 William B. Todd 16 Curt F. Bühler 15 G. E. Bentley, Jr. 10 Robert K. Turner, Jr. 10 Matthew J. Bruccoli 9 Ralph Hanna III 9 Rollo G. Silver 9 Louis Daniel Brodsky 8 Martin C. Battestin 7 Cyrus Hoy 7 George Walton Williams 7 Cyprian Blagden 6 John Russell Brown 6 Emily Lorraine de Montluzin 6 MacD. P. Jackson 6 C. William Miller 6 Dennis E. Rhodes 6 Since some of these scholars have tended to contribute short pieces, a perhaps more meaningful indication of which writers are most responsible for shaping the character of Studies is a ranking according to the number of pages their contributions cover. Those who have contributed more than 125 pages are as follows: 41 G. Thomas Tanselle 1468 Fredson Bowers 518 Arthur Sherbo 286 G. E. Bentley, Jr. 237 William B. Todd 236 Emily Lorraine de Montluzin 193 Martin C. Battestin 175 Rollo G. Silver 164 David L. Vander Meulen 163 Cyrus Hoy 161 Adrian Weiss 150 Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. 147 Robert K. Turner, Jr. 146 D. F. McKenzie 142 These lists dramatize the extent to which SB has fostered a group of loyal contributors, who repeatedly return to its pages. But these figures should be balanced against the fact that the total number of contributors is 509--hardly a closed circle. For the past half-century Studies in Bibliography has been at the heart of bibliographical developments. Its fifty volumes, essential reading when they were published, will continue to be essential reading--not only because they are central to the bibliographical history of the times but also because they contain an extraordinary number of fundamental articles of permanent interest. This fact has been recognized by the decision to mark the anniversary by placing the entire run of Studies on the Internet. From now on, readers will have access to all the material in Studies through the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia's site on the World Wide Web (http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/), with the advantages for searching and downloading that are provided by electronic publication. 42 Studies will continue to appear in printed form (printed from Linotype), and the text of new volumes will be added to the electronic database as well. Although SB is by no means the first scholarly journal to appear in electronic form, it is the first to have its entire--and sizable--back file made available on the Internet without charge. This action makes a clear statement: that the whole file is of permanent value and that any available technology for making it widely accessible will be used. One hopes that the Society's handling of SB will be followed by those responsible for other journals in the electronic future. Certainly the anniversary of Studies in Bibliography is being marked in a forward-looking spirit; and, with an experienced new editor fully in control, there is every reason to regard the journal's future with confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 " The Library : A History of Forty Volumes," Library , 4th ser., 10 (1929-30), 398-417. 2 Some of the relevant details are sketched in below, but many more can be found in my The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (1993; published also in Volume 46 of Studies in Bibliography , pp. 1-154). (Several passages from that work, especially from pp. 34-39 and 130-134, have been reused in revised form in the present essay.) Two other treatments of Bowers and his journal are George Walton Williams, "Fredson Bowers and Studies in Bibliography ," in Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook 1991 , ed. James W. Hipp (1992), pp. 226-228; and David L. Vander Meulen, "Fredson Bowers and the Editing of Studies in Bibliography ," Text , 8 (1995), 31-36. 3 That this point was recognized early is shown by G. Blakemore Evans in his 1951 review of the first three volumes: "In these volumes," he said, "one sees for the first time an American publication offering a major challenge to the hitherto secure position of The Library " ( Journal of English and Germanic Philology , 50: 421-423). 4 And some of those few were much delayed in their appearance. Three of the more important came out several years later in the form of comments on the first three or five volumes: in 1951 G. Blakemore Evans reviewed the first three volumes for Journal of English and Germanic Philology (50: 421-423); in 1952 Johan Gerritsen reviewed the first three for English Studies (33: 134-136); and in 1953 Philip Gaskell reviewed the first five for The Book Collector (2: 159-160). Even Bald's review (quoted below), solely of Volume 1, did not appear until 1951. 5 On 16 September 1949, Bowers wrote to Massey, "I have come to the conclusion that we should slightly change our title for vol. 2, and I want to see what you think of it since it should probably be a Council matter but we shall have to know before the page proof (expected daily) goes back. I think our present title is too cumbersome and somewhat gives to the outside world a too restricted idea of the scope of the Papers. I think if we are to achieve the national idea we want, we should have a more general title, with the present as a subtitle." The choice of "Studies in Bibliography" did not come easily, however; Bowers first suggested simply "Bibliography" and "The Bibliographer," and in a letter four days later he discussed "Bibliology" and "The Bibliographical Annual" as possibilities. 6 Bowers was not to read Todd's dissertation until the following summer, when he served on Todd's examining committee. An account of this event and of Bowers's excitement over Todd's treatment of press figures appears in The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (see note 2 above), p. 76. 7 Dunkin had just previously criticized Bowers's ideas on descriptive bibliography in "The State of the Issue," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 42 (1948), 239-255; and he was to continue his attack in How to Catalog a Rare Book (1951) and Bibliography: Tiger or Fat Cat? (1975). For my comments on this controversy, see pp. 39-41 of "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing," SB , 30 (1977), 1-56 (or pp. 75-77 of the reprinted form of the article in Selected Studies in Bibliography [1979], pp. 37-92). 8 See Williams, "Fredson Bowers and Studies in Bibliography " (note 2 above). 9 Although the previous April Bowers had regarded the possibility of their appearing in SB as a "pipedream," given the English Institute's usual custom of publishing its own papers, by mid- September he could report that he had "made a deal with the English Institute . . . whereby we secure rights to the four papers in this year's bibliographical section and the four in next year's" as long as the Institute was allowed to distribute offprints to its members. (These comments are from Bowers's letters to Linton Massey on 30 April and 16 September 1949.) 10 Bowers's role in these developments is discussed in The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (see note 2 above), esp. pp. 48-49, 88-89; a fuller account of Greg's influence and the controversy it engendered is in my Textual Criticism since Greg (1987). 11 Although most reviewers that commented at all on the physical design of SB praised it, Bond was not the only one to have reservations. Philip Gaskell's review of the first five volumes in The Book Collector (2 [1953], 159-160) concluded this way: "The physical appearance of Studies is not unfortunately so admirable as its contents. Its typography . . ., although generally inoffensive, emphasizes the inability of most contemporary American commercial printers to design an aesthetically satisfying book; while the paper, which anyway seems unnecessarily opulent in quality, retains its machine-made deckle at the fore-edge: surely bibliographers, of all people, should know better?" There is justice in these remarks, but also from England came praise for the design: Greg's review of the first volume says that it is "tastefully and even sumptuously printed" and that the contents are "worthy of their handsome setting" ( Modern Language Review , 45 [1950], 76), and F. C. Francis's review of Volumes 2 and 3 asserts that their "printing and get-up . . . are of the highest quality" ( Library , 5th ser., 6 [1951], 62-64). 12 Bowers later experimented, for reasons of economy, with placing the notes at the end of each article, but this experiment was fortunately short-lived (Volumes 41-43 only). 13 The colophon for Volume 18 (1965) states that the paper is Strathmore Pastelle, but the usual Pastelle watermark is not present. 14 These sources continued to be acknowledged in volumes of Studies through the twenty-first (1968). Surviving correspondence between Bowers and Massey gives a sense of how vital Massey's generosity was and how grateful Bowers was for it. Bowers's long letter of 14 April 1949, largely on financial matters, shows the difficulty of balancing the budget in the early years. "I cannot conceal that the financial troubles of the Papers have weighed very heavily on my mind," he said; and, regarding Massey's help, he added, "I now feel an enormous weight removed." Four and a half years later (on 18 November 1953), Bowers mentioned to him "your invariable anonymous generosity." Two years after that, Bowers wrote to Massey, "If and when we ever really get on our feet firmly, and are able to look back at all perils past, . . . it will become quite clear that it was truly your quiet assistance that kept us going and carried us over the hump." 15 By this time, the distinction between "articles" and "notes" had become more typographical than substantive, as James Kinsley suggested in his review of the fifth volume in Review of English Studies (n.s., 5 [1954], 102-104): "The 'Bibliograhica' at the end of the book are closely printed in small type. Some of these essays are long and commendably detailed bibliographical descriptions and arguments, and might have changed places, to the greater comfort of the reader, with more discursive contributions standing towards the beginning of the book in the dignity of large type." Besides the use of small type, the section of "notes" was marked in Volume 1 with the heading "Bibliographical Notes" and in the next four volumes with the heading "Bibliographica." After that, there was no labeling other than the type size; and the distinction between pieces set in one size and those set in the other was obviously not based on length or significance but rather reflected Bowers's decision to single out certain pieces (very few in some later volumes) as feature articles. 16 Or, indeed, before the beginning of the year for which a volume was dated. The Secretary's News Sheet for September 1953 (No. 28) reported that Volume 6, for 1954, was likely to be ready "before the Christmas mailing rush." And I happen to remember one occasion, in the early 1970s I believe, when my copy arrived in November, just before the Thanksgiving holiday. It is rare for scholarly periodicals to appear in the early part of the period for which they are dated, and even rarer for them to appear in advance of that period. 17 From the start, Bowers had been eager to have such articles: on 16 April 1949 he said, in a letter to Linton Massey, that he had wanted for the second volume a piece "like Stevenson's [in Volume 1] opening new ground in watermarks," since the second volume, though he thought it "overall superior to volume one, is often devoted only to individual books." 18 For brevity, I shall occasionally cite only volume numbers; a table listing volume numbers and corresponding years is given in footnote 26. (In the discussion of the reviews of SB below, some volume numbers are linked with slashes to indicate multiple volumes taken up in a single review.) 19 The others were John Russell Brown's "The Printing of John Webster's Plays" (6, 8, 15); Robert Hay Carnie and Ronald Patterson Doig's "Scottish Printers and Booksellers 1668-1775" (which appeared in Volume 12 and was followed in Volumes 14 and 15 by Carnie's two-part "Second Supplement"); Patricia Hernlund's "William Strahan's Ledgers" (20, 22); A. B. England's "Further Additions to Bond's Register of Burlesque Poems" (27, 28); Clinton Sisson's "Additions and Corrections to the Second Edition of Donald Wing's Short-Title Catalogue" (29-31, the first two parts in collaboration with Jeri S. Smith and the last with Timothy Crist); A. S. G. Edwards's "New Texts of Marvell's Satires " (30, 31, the first with R. M. Schuler); and Emily Lorraine de Montluzin's "Attributions of Authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine " (44-47, 49, 50). Bowers's own "The Textual Relation of Q2 to Q1 Hamlet (I)" in Volume 8 ends with the notation " to be concluded "; an explanation in the next volume says that the second part is "omitted . . . owing to lack of space but is planned for volume XI in 1958," but it never appeared. Similarly, Hans Walter Gabler's compositorial study of Cupid's Revenge in Volume 24 was labeled "Part I," but no second part came out. (Addenda to previously published articles are not counted here as instances of serialization.) 20 Though he appeared twice in three of the volumes. These figures exclude the checklists of bibliographical scholarship: thus they do not count the first checklist (which he helped to compile) as one of his contributions or the tenth volume (consisting entirely of checklists) as one of the volumes he edited. 21 Note, for example, the opening sentence of A. N. L. Munby's review of Volume 19: "The most important contribution to the current number of Studies in Bibliography comes from the editor's hand" ( Modern Language Review , 61 [1966], 671-672). 22 The strength of the total roster of contributors is shown by the fact that a distinguished list can be formed from names not so far mentioned--it would include the following one-time contributors: Hyder E. Rollins (9), William Charvat (12), Ian Watt (12), A. N. L. Munby (14), J. C. T. Oates (16), Clifford Leech (23), Frederick Burkhardt (41), and David Bevington (42). 23 Cf. Robert Donaldson's comment, in his review of Volume 22, that some may believe McKenzie's article has "injected so much uncertainty into the already immensely complicated structures of analytical bibliography that it is no longer worth the time and concentration necessary to develop them" ( Library , 5th ser., 25 [1970], 158-160). And see Bowers's remark in the next footnote. 24 In one of the new footnotes in his 1975 volume of collected essays ( Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing ), Bowers said of McKenzie's article: "I find I cannot accept his attempted disintegration of relatively efficient and economical printing practices in a small London competitive commercial printing-house in the early years of the 17th and the later years of the 16th centuries from the special evidence of the late-Restoration Cambridge University Press printing practices operating on a non-commercial and non-hurried basis without pressure for completion applied by a commercial publisher. Unless one is to scrap analytical bibliography altogether (as Dr. McKenzie comes perilously close to recommending) it may seem sounder to base one's reconstructions on the hypothesis of attempted efficiency, as in Moxon, instead of deliberate inefficiency" (p. 250). 25 Note, for example, his criticism of Zeller's article in two new footnotes in his 1975 volume of essays (see the preceding note): in one, he characterized its attitude as a "fetish" (p. 409), and in the other he questioned its use of the word "critical" to describe its approach (p. 527). 26 The fact that SB 's fiftieth volume appears in the fiftieth year of the Society seems at first quite obvious and expected; but when one notices that two volumes were published in 1957, one realizes that the relation of volumes to years is not so simple. The complexities all occur in connection with the first ten volumes; from Volume 11 (1958) onwards, there has been a regular progression. Each of the first five volumes carries an academic-year designation (starting with 1948-49) in the center of the title page along with the volume number, though in the imprint at the foot of the page only a single calendar year is given (starting with 1948). Beginning with Volume 6, calendar-year designations are given in both places, but in that volume the one in mid-page is 1954 and the one at the foot of the page is 1953. From Volume 7 (1955) on, the same year is given both places, and the only irregularity after that is the assignment of both Volume 9 and Volume 10 to 1957. Because Volume 1 did not appear until the end of the Society's second year, the publication of two volumes in 1957 actually served to bring the volume numbering into line with the Society's age. For the reader's convenience in correlating years and volume numbers, the following table shows the year designation that should be cited for each volume: 1 1948-49 11 1958 21 1968 31 1978 41 1988 2 1949-50 12 1959 22 1969 32 1979 42 1989 3 1950-51 13 1960 23 1970 33 1980 43 1990 4 1951-52 14 1961 24 1971 34 1981 44 1991 5 1952-53 15 1962 25 1972 35 1982 45 1992 6 1954 16 1963 26 1973 36 1983 46 1993 7 1955 17 1964 27 1974 37 1984 47 1994 8 1956 18 1965 28 1975 38 1985 48 1995 9 1957 19 1966 29 1976 39 1986 49 1996 10 1957 20 1967 30 1977 40 1987 50 1997 27 Defined, in the footnote to the 1950 list, as through 1550. 28 Robert Donaldson began his review of Volume 21 by saying, "Few bibliographers can have failed to make use of the selective checklists of bibliographical scholarship that end each volume of SB " ( Library , 5th ser., 24 [1969], 156-158). 29 The previous cumulative volume, it should be noted, was published in two forms: one had the SB title page (labeled "Volume Ten") and the SB cover and spine labels; the other had a title page and cover label reading simply Selective Check Lists of Bibliographical Scholarship 1949- 1955 and a spine label abbreviating this title, with no reference to SB (except that the copyright page identified the volume as "a separate issue of sheets from Volume X of Studies in Bibliography "). Obviously the non- SB form was later needed to fill out sets of SB , for in some copies there is an inserted slip with a two-sentence message, the second sentence of which reads: "In spite of the oblique note on the copyright page this is the complete Volume X of the series and should be catalogued as such." The casing of the 1966 volume containing Series B was made approximately to match that of the non- SB form of the 1957 volume. 30 See further B. J. McMullin's evaluation of the situation on pp. 2-7 of his "Indexing the Periodical Literature of Anglo- American Bibliography," SB , 33 (1980), 1-17. He discusses the limitations of the SB lists (their selectivity and their inadequate indexing) and of ABHB and concludes that the indexes of the Modern Language Association and the Modern Humanities Research Association are superior to any current index focusing on the book world in their coverage of "the major Anglo-American bibliographical periodicals." (I had earlier commented briefly on the SB lists at the beginning of "The Periodical Literature of English and American Bibliography," SB , 26 [1973], 167- 191--praising them in what turned out to be their penultimate year.) 31 Although the article contains some sensible observations on "degressive bibliography," it seems illogically fearful of what it calls "bibliography for bibliography's sake." It concludes with this sentence: "The operation of the admirable machinery evolved by Greg, Bowers and Tanselle must not become an end in itself, for descriptive technique is the bibliographer's servant, not his master or his god." That an article largely celebrating Bowers's achievement should end on this cautionary note reflects a persistent debate that always surrounded Bowers. Although one can reasonably argue that "technique" should not be an end in itself, what is really at stake here is the idea that bibliography is a genre of scholarly writing; Bowers's logical concept of bibliography as history has itself had a strange history of arousing resistance. 32 This particular phrasing is from Karl J. Holzknecht's review of Volume 7 in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 49 (1955), 190-195. But the phenomenon itself was remarked on by J. C. T. Oates in his review of Volume 9: "It is usual to begin a review of Studies in Bibliography with the statement that the new volume is full of meat" ( Library , 5th ser., 13 [1958], 70-71)--an observation that is literally true, for L. W. Hanson's review of Volume 7 in the same journal had said, "This volume, like its predecessors, is full of meat" (5th ser., 10 [1955], 295-298), and Holzknecht's review had called Volume 7 "one of the meatiest volumes so far issued." Another reviewer who commented on the repeated encomia was Roy Stokes, who began his review of Volume 14 ( Library Association Record , 63 [1961], 222-223) this way: "There is some slight danger that the chorus of praise which greets the arrival of this annual offering of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia might become monotonous." (Then he added, "It is difficult to over-estimate the cumulative importance of these volumes.") 33 The presence of SB has been maintained in a literal sense as well, for the volumes have been kept in print most of the time. The financial statements for 1958-63 (in Secretary's News Sheet Nos. 41, 44, 47-49, 51) indicate that the stock of Volumes 2 and 6 was exhausted during 1959, that of Volume 7 during 1960, that of Volumes 3, 11, and 14 during 1962, and that of Volumes 1, 10, 12, and 13 during 1963 (with the stock of the other early volumes very low). Accordingly, in October 1964 the first reprints were produced, and by June 1972 the first twenty-one volumes (except for Volume 10, the checklist volume) had been reprinted--in nine batches, as follows: October 1964 (1-3, 5), April 1965 (6-9), February 1966 (11-14), May 1966 (4), January 1968 (19), July 1968 (20), January 1970 (15, 21), and June 1972 (16). These reprinted volumes differ in a number of ways from the originals--as if to illustrate the bibliographical point that reprints cannot be assumed to be identical with the originals! The primary difference is the omission of the checklists of bibliographical scholarship. The reprint of Volume 3 (the first volume to include a checklist) carries this statement in brackets on page 292: "Pages 292-302 having been reprinted in Vol. X with some corrections and an index, they are not repeated in this reissue." Similar notes appear in the succeeding reprinted volumes to explain the missing pagination, since the pagination of the material that followed the checklists is not altered. Other items are also omitted, such as the advertisements and the lists of Society publications for sale; sometimes (but not always) the colophons and the mailing addresses of Society officers are omitted, and sometimes (but not always) the tables of contents are modified to reflect omissions. The occasional notes of errata and addenda at the ends of some of the original volumes appear sometimes on different pages in the reprints (the Stevenson note in Volume 4 is moved from p. 235 to p. 91, and the Gaskell in Volume 6 from p. 286 to p. 266); in one instance the information on an errata slip in the original (regarding Miller's article in Volume 3) is printed on the page just preceding the article in the reprint, in another instance (Guilds's errata note in Volume 9) the errata are incorporated into the article, and another time (the Garner note in Volume 17) the note is simply omitted. The reprint of Volume 20 contains the notice "Reissued, with corrections, July 1968" and does incorporate corrections of several typographical errors. In the same year as the first reprints, the University Press of Virginia was engaged as the distributor of Studies; and the title-page imprint beginning with Volume 17 (1964) has been "Published for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia by the University Press of Virginia." New title pages were provided for the reprints of the volumes preceding the seventeenth. 34 How entrenched this habit became is amusingly epitomized by a note in his 1975 volume of collected essays (see note 24 above): in a new footnote appended to a sentence (written in 1941) on the possibility of using headlines to detect page-by-page (rather than forme-by-forme) printing, he wrote, "For reasons that escape me, I never have pursued this promising lead. Perhaps some interested bibliographer will have a look at the problem (and let me publish his results in SB . . .)" (p. 207). Even in his collected essays, he could not resist the urge to stir up contributions. 35 Bowers's respect for the writings of contributors is one of the ways in which he revealed his understanding of the connections between the scholarly editing of classic works and the editing of articles for a journal--a connection that is rarely made. His experience in thinking about textual matters in his scholarly editing surely lies behind his sensitive treatment of various aspects of contributors' manuscripts--his recognition, for instance, that it is more sensible to let British scholars retain their British spellings than to enforce a formal consistency from article to article. 36 Gillian Kyles in the volumes for 1974-76, Clinton Sisson in the 1975 and 1976 volumes as well, and Susan Hitchcock in the 1977 volume. 37 Vander Meulen's account of what Bowers's attention meant to him is in "Fredson Bowers and the Editing of Studies in Bibliography" (see note 2 above). 38 Only twice before had volumes of SB carried dedications: Volume 22 (1969) was dedicated to John Cook Wyllie, the rare-book librarian at Virginia who had been the Society's secretary-treasurer from the beginning; and Volume 28 (1975) began with a dedication to Linton R. Massey, the collector who had been the Society's president in 1948-49 and 1951-74, as well as a loyal (though anonymous) benefactor of Studies (see note 14 above). 39 Vander Meulen has acknowledged this development in "Fredson Bowers and the Editing of Studies in Bibliography" (see note 2 above): "One innovation quietly underway is a series of `lives of the bibliographers,' an attempt to understand the past and hence the present of bibliography." 40 These figures do not include the checklists of bibliographical scholarship, the introduction to Volume 10, and the double foreword to Volume 20. (If they did, the number of contributors would be increased by five—since Lucy Clark, Derek Clarke, Frank Francis, Anne Freudenberg, and Howell Heaney did not contribute otherwise.) The figures do treat as separate contributions any notes of addenda to articles in preceding volumes, whether or not those notes are listed in the tables of contents (but they do not count the errata listed at the ends of some volumes). 41 These figures do not take into account whether the pages are of the larger type size for feature articles or the smaller size for the other articles and notes. If the measure were the number of lines rather than pages, a few names (of persons whose articles, or some of them, appeared on the smaller-type pages with more lines) would of course move somewhat higher up in the list. 42 The great advantages of the electronic form do not, of course, make the original printed volumes superfluous--a point obvious to all those who (like bibliographers) understand the role of physical evidence in the transmission of verbal texts. See my article in Volume 42 of Studies ("Reproductions and Scholarship") and my more recent essay on "The Future of Primary Records," in Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, 58 (1996), 53-73 and in Biblion, 5.1 (Fall 1996), 4-32.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In 1893 the Catholic University of Louvain inaugurated a curriculum in Germanic philology (i.e. English, Dutch, and German studies). The German Orientalist Willy Bang Kaup (1869-1934) was among the first professors of the new section and became responsible for the courses of English language and literature. Bang, who had come to Louvain to study in the famous Oriental school of Prof. Charles de Harlez, published from 1889 onwards many articles on Old-Persian, "Kökturkish", and related topics. Undoubtedly, "the experience gained by his Oriental studies" was of great influence on his English scholarship, and "he had learned to found scientific structure only on texts both accurately represented and judiciously interpreted by unexceptionable linguistic and historic information", as his successor H. De Vocht put it in 1935. 1 In 1902 Bang set up a series of Materialien zur Kunde des älteren Englischen Dramas (Louvain, Uystpruyst) aiming at the publication of editions of 16th- and 17th-century English dramatic works. The first volume in the series was The Blind Beggar of Bednall Green by Henry Chettle and John Day, edited after the quarto of 1659. In his introductory notes ("Vorbemerkungen") we learn in a nutshell Bang's editorial principles: an exact report of the copies known to the editor ( in casu two), explicit indication of the copy used, discussion of the reasons why this copy is preferred, and a survey of the variant readings. The editor here gives the text of the copy belonging to the collector Bernard Quaritch; 2 "in dem Exemplar des Brit. Mus. Sind, wie dies öfter geschah, eine Anzahl von Verbesserungen angebracht worden [in the copy of the Brit. Mus., as this frequently happened, a number of corrections have been made]", Bang maintains (p. IX), thus setting the problem of press corrections. He gives a reprint of Quaritch's copy, " ohne jegliche Veränderung [ without any alteration ]", so that his edition practically has the value of a facsimile reprint ("soweit Menschenwerk sich mit einem rein mechanischen Verfahren überhaupt messen kann [so far as work of man can measure altogether with purely mechanical procedures]" [p.IX]). Bang realized however that a photographic reproduction better reflects the particularities of the original, e.g. broken characters. Even so, he tried to give as accurate a reproduction of the original text as possible, including misprints or spelling mistakes. Remarks on non-printed or broken characters or misprints are given among the explanatory annotations ("Erläuterungen"). At the end he provides a short index of names and terms. The next year, 1903, Bang published two more editions: The King and Queenes Entertainement at Richmond (1636), in collaboration with the Viennese professor R. Brotanek, and Pleasant Dialogues and Dramma's from Thomas Heywood (1637). In 1904 two eminent editors, actually the founders of analytical bibliography in Great Britain, appeared in the series: W. W. Greg and R. B. McKerrow. 3 Greg was recommended to Bang by G. C. Moore Smith (1858-1940; Professor of English literature ) in a letter of October 29, 1902 ("Greg is Sub-editor of the Modern Quarterly. If you want another collaborateur, he would be a good man for you. He is a man of property"). 4 At that time, Bang and Greg were already in correspondence (there is at any rate a letter from Greg dated January 26, 1902). Greg in turn recommended McKerrow to Bang in a letter dated February 9, 1903 ("If you happen to want furter [ sic ] co-operators I would suggest your writing to R. B. McKerrow . . . he is a very keen student + one of the most accurate men I know"). An intensive correspondence developed between Greg and McKerrow on the one hand and Bang on the other. Greg's and McKerrow's letters to Bang, extant in the Louvain University Library, 5 throw much light on the genesis and the reception of some editions in the Materialien series, and they provide us with background information on the founding of Greg's Malone Society. I shall look at these aspects in greater detail. On November 5, 1902, Greg expressed his thanks to Bang for receiving a copy of The Blind Beggar and he referred to a review by Prof. Moore Smith about to appear in The Modern Language Quarterly ; to this review Greg had added a note in which Bang would see--according to Greg--that he (Greg) is "not altogether in favour of the very conservative methods" Bang has adopted. Nevertheless Greg expresses his readiness "to undertake a play" in Bang's series "on the lines you have laid down", as he puts it to Bang. In his review of Bang's Blind Beggar in The Modern Language Quarterly 6 Greg indeed turns against "the ultra-conservative system now commonly adopted"; he states that "reliable 'critical' editions" are needed and not so much an attempt to produce "a photographic facsimile", and he notes that what Bang puts forward as "Materialien" "is in fact but the 'material' for an edition". While Bang in his edition has intentionally retained the misprints of the original, it would--according to Greg--have been normal to give a list of these misprints or to mention them in the notes. Because that has not been done, we do not know whether misprints in the actual text are intentional or not. Moreover, Bang "informs us that he has used a transcript from a copy in the British Museum. There are, however, two copies in our national collection". What is worse, Bang gives some differences between his transcript of the (or better: a) British Museum copy and the copy of Mr. Quaritch he actually uses; Greg has been able to inspect the original copies in the British Museum and to establish that in those cases there are no deviations at all. In 1903 Greg reviewed the second volume in the Materialien series 7 and found some improvements as compared with the first--e.g., a list of misprints is now given. As to the editorial principles, Greg refers to what he had said earlier, but he is at the same time "glad to learn from Prof. Bang that his series is equally open to 'critical editions', which at the present, we confess, appear to us the greater desideratum". It is interesting in this respect to refer to a short letter of Greg's dated February 3, 1903, in which he speaks of a copy of The Library he sends to Bang, "which contains an article of mine on the editing of plays". A glance at this article, published in The Library in 1902, 8 shows that Greg after all has a moderate opinion as to the editing of older plays; he tries to hit upon a middle course between "uncritical mangling of an author" and "pedantic retention of an obsolete orthography" (p. 415). Still he seems to be more inclined to what he calls "the literatim method" (p. 418) than to modernization or normalization of the text. At the end of Greg's article occurs a remarkable passage that bears examination. Greg alludes to "the possibility of a large number of plays being reprinted on some uniform plan", "the text of each play . . . published separately". With some "expert non-literary assistance in proof-reading and collation", "it might be possible for a single scholar to produce, on a uniform principle, sufficient texts to keep his literary friends well employed in writing notes and introductions to them, and the advantages of such a division of labour would be many" (pp. 425-426). In other words, this article suggests that Greg was considering the creation of a society for the editing of older plays in 1902, about the time the first volume of Bang's Materialien was at press and a couple of years before he would start his own series of editions in the Malone Society. In 1904 Greg published two volumes in the Materialien : Everyman and A New Enterlude of Godly Queene Hester . He had referred to his edition of A New Enterlude . . . as early as 1902. In his already mentioned letter to Bang dated November 5 of that year, he not only expressed his willingness to edit a play but he also indicated he had a title in mind. If he were to publish an edition in Bang's series, he would choose " Queen Hester ", provided he could "get the Duke of Devonshire's copy transfered to the British Museum". In his letters to Bang we learn about some difficulties Greg had in obtaining that volume (cf. letters of January 22, February 5, February 9, February 20, and April 21, 1903). Greg edited the work after the unique extant copy of the 1561 original. His edition consists of an introduction (description of the copy, former editions, date, and authorship), a list of misprints in the original, the text of the play, and explanatory notes with an "Index to the notes". He renders the text as faithfully to the original as possible; even the misprints mentioned are left in the text. Greg explicitly states that he has followed "the methods adopted in the earlier volumes of the Materialien " (p. VII). R. B. McKerrow, who was working on his great edition of Thomas Nashe (published 1904-1910), was in June 1903 "making a transcript of 'The Devil's Charter'" (letter of June 11). The work appeared in 1904 as The Devil's Charter by Barnabe Barnes edited from the quarto of 1607 . Introduction (date, sources, text), appendix, the edited text proper, textual notes, explanatory notes, and an index: these are the parts of the edition. McKerrow made use of four copies of the quarto of 1607, which differ from one another. Aware that press-corrections were common in the handpress-period, McKerrow does not simply give a reprint of one of the copies; he draws attention to the fact that, in order to try to "represent as nearly as possible what the author intended" (p. XV), some sheets must be taken from one copy and others from another. But, given the actual process of printing, one should even go further, and take the forme as the unit of printing, not the sheet ("it has never been pointed out and is far from being generally recognized" [p. XV]). With this statement, McKerrow lays down one of the basic rules of analytical bibliography. In his introduction McKerrow gives "a table showing the condition with regard to correctness of the outer and inner pages respectively of each sheet of the four copies . . .". He follows copy A, except for two sheets for which the different formes are most corrected in copy B (pp. XVII-XVIII). The "textual notes" at the end give the variants between the different copies. The text of the play proper, including its misprints, is given as faithfully as possible, with those errors in the original edition corrected in the explanatory notes. There is in this respect some problem with the distinction between "e" and "c". McKerrow had pointed out already in a letter to Bang on October 21, 1903, that about 25% of the "e's" in The Devils' Charter look like "c's". In his introduction to the edition he deals again with the question, pointing out that the cross-bar of the "e" is frequently absent, owing as he supposes "to the printer clearing out the letter with a spike"; as a result the "e" in these cases resembles the "c". "In such cases when an e was obviously required I have given c only if it seemed fairly certain that the wrong letter really had been used" (p. XVIII). In the next year, 1905, Greg and McKerrow continued their editorial activities in the Materialien series. Bang and Greg together brought about an edition of Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humor , while Bang and McKerrow published The Enterlude of Youth . Greg edited Ben Jonson's Sad Shepherd in the same year. The years 1905-1906 were decisive for the foundation of the Malone Society, and Greg's and McKerrow's letters to Bang contain important information in this regard. A prefiguration of the society turns up in a letter from McKerrow of August 4, 1905. In it he speaks of the "scheme" by Bullen (the editor of McKerrow's Nashe edition) "for reprinting a lot of things", although "the scheme is in an embryo state yet"; "The idea is to do all the books that were widely read when Shakespeare came to London or about that time". A couple of days later (August 8) McKerrow tells Bang about his visit to Stratford-on-Avon, where Bullen lived at that time, "to discuss the new series". He reassures Bang, "We shall not interfere at all with yours". A short letter from McKerrow dated August 12 says nothing about the intended series, but in McKerrow's letter of August 20 there is an interesting passage worth quoting at some length. Perhaps Bang has proposed to collaborate; McKerrow writes: "I don't think Bullen will want any collaborators for the new series at present , [the difficulty canceled ] as the scheme will have to go on very slowly--at first at any rate--to see if there is any chance of its paying. The great difficulty is the cost of transcripts. People in this country will not buy books of the kind, and unless one can get rid of a considerable part of an edition abroad one doesn't get ones [ sic ] money back (e.g. he tells me that, of the copies of Nashe already sold, germany has taken just about half, which doesn't say much for the interest taken here in Eliz. lit.)". Ten days later, August 30: "The series is for the moment at a standstill--or rather it has not begun to move. but I hope it will". And again on September 2: "The series of 'Shakespeare's Books' is hung up for the moment but I hope will go forward later". McKerrow enumerates titles that might be included. He points out he has been thinking for years of the necessity of starting a new Elizabethan society. In order that such a society would not disappear like other literary societies, McKerrow thinks that it should be "merely a reprinting society, with no meetings or only an annual one, and management kept in the hands of a good [and str canceled ] committee of people who actually had worked or were working for the society (without 'figureheads')". "Some day I shall try", he continues, "if no one [ next word interlined ] else does it first,--but not until I have finished Nashe &amp; a few other things". On June 16, 1906, Bang received a letter from Greg that must have puzzled him. Greg expounds his idea "to start a society for the production of facsimile reprints of old plays--primarily before 1600. It is not proposed to have any sort of critical apparatus but to concentrate our efforts on facsimile work". "Mechanical process work" is too expensive and gives unsatisfactory results, according to Greg, "so we are driven back on type facsimiles". A fortnight later (July 3) McKerrow informs Bang that the three plays he referred to in a former letter (May 31), namely Wealth and Health , Impatient Poverty , and John the Evangelist , have been bought by the British Museum. As to Greg and "this scheme of his" McKerrow says: "I don't myself know much about it as he [Greg] seems to wish to keep it rather dark from me--at any rate he has not been very communicative on the subject". In the margin McKerrow notes: "Don't say anything about this to Greg, or to anyone else--it may be unintentional on his part". McKerrow thinks that Greg is going to issue the three plays mentioned. 9 In the middle of July Bang received two most important letters--one from A. W. Pollard (July 15) and one from Greg (July 17)--that tell us more about the intention and the background of the foundation of the new society. 10 Bang must have written an alarming letter to Greg in answer to the latter's announcement of the society to be founded (cf. supra, letter dated June 16); Greg had shown Bang's letter to Pollard, 11 who in his letter to Bang admits that the society is his idea. At the same time he proposes some help (e.g., in selling the volumes of the Materialien ). Pollard frankly affirms that a national sense is the main motive behind the proposal ("scholars like Mr. Greg &amp; Mr McKerrow have to take their work abroad to find print &amp; paper"); moreover, we English are used to this kind of editorial work, he says, and the interest we arouse will perhaps bring new subscribers to the Materialien too. For the moment Pollard does not fall in with Bang's idea of starting a larger Tudor and Stuart Text Society. It should be mentioned in passing that this was not the first time the motive of national responsibility was used in connection with the edition of older English plays. Indeed, when Henry Charles Moore reviewed McKerrow's The Devil's Charter and Bang's Ben Jonson's Dramas in Notes and Queries of February 18, 1905, he says "we cannot but regret that it is reserved to foreigners to accomplish what should be assumed as a national responsibility". As McKerrow was anything but a foreigner, it is obvious that the reviewer aimed at the Materialien series as a whole. The same idea turns up again in Greg's lengthy letter of July 17 (cf. Appendix). Foreigners working in English scholarship have his full support, he says, "but that does not prevent my holding that the work ought to be done by us Englishmen ourselves, as an English affair". Greg states clearly that, although originally he met Bang's editorial method with mistrust (cf. supra), it was largely through working for the Materialien that he was converted to the method of the facsimile reprint. Greg thinks the societies can work harmoniously side by side, and he hopes to be able to participate further in the Materialien series. He closes by referring to a meeting scheduled for July 30 to found the society and he says that he has sent Bang's letter to Frank Sidgwick of the publishing house A. H. Bullen. There are two letters dated July 19 from McKerrow to Bang. In one of them McKerrow expresses his doubts on the usefulness of the new society, "though if there was some hope that they would actually do all the plays, it would be useful. Most societies, however, do a little of the more obvious work and then, when they come to what is out of the way &amp; really wants doing, they collapse". On July 20 F. Sidgwick, to whom Greg had sent Bang's letter, expressed in a letter to Bang his view--which he also uttered "to Greg, McKerrow, and Chambers"--that Bang, "being first in the field with Materialien ", should have the priority as far as the three recently discovered plays (cf. supra) are concerned. A couple of days later (July 23) Sidgwick could reassure Bang: he has been talking to Greg and McKerrow, and he thinks "matters will go smoothly regarding the new Text society". As a matter of fact, on July 24 both Greg and McKerrow wrote (separately) a letter to Bang, stating that, if Bang wanted one of the cited plays (specifically, Impatient Poverty ) in the Materialien , there would be no interference on their part (by means of an edition of their own, for instance). Moreover, the new society, as McKerrow puts it, "will in general make it a principle to interfere as little as possible with lines of work which you have taken up", and Greg even proposes to Bang to recommend that the new society should elect him an Honorary member. At a meeting on July 30 the Malone Society was founded, with its object, according to the prospectus, "the production of accurate copies of the best editions of early plays". Greg would act as a secretary, and in the organizing committee of the society McKerrow was appointed "more or less to represent the interests of the Materialien !!" as he writes in a letter to Bang on July 31. 12 In Bang's papers are minutes of two letters he wrote in September 1906 to A. Feuillerat, the French scholar who edited, among other things, Documents of the Office of the Revels, under Elizabeth in the Materialien (1908). The letter dated September 26 gives us a rare testimony by Bang about the foundation of the Malone Society. He writes: "Quant à Greg-Pollard it n'y a rien eu du tout entre nous ( à ce que je sache au moins . . . ); mais il[s canceled ] leur semble que English scholarship ne doit pas marcher sous les ordres de l'Etranger--vous connaissez, sans doute, le beau terme de 'national shame'! [As to Greg-Pollard, nothing at all came between us ( at least as far as I know . . .); but it seems to them that English scholarship should not march by order of the Foreigner--you undoubtedly know the beautiful term of 'national shame'!]". He refers to the fact that he proposed them to found a " Tudor &amp; Stuart Texts Soc. ", but: "rien pour le moment [nothing at the moment]". And that Bang was not unperturbed by the foundation of the Malone Society is proved by the passage: "Toute cette affaire m'a joliment mis hors de mes gonds au moment où je vous ai écrit que j'étais énervé. C'est fini maintenant, mais il se peut que je devienne dégouté de tout le 'bazar' si ces Messieurs ne sont pas sages [The whole affair has nicely made me beside myself the moment I wrote you that I was excited. It's over now, but it's possible that I get disgusted with all the rubbish if these Gentlemen are not wise]". A little further on: ils m'ont promis qu'il n'y aurait jamais de friction entre nous [They promised me that there will never be any friction between us]". It is quite obvious that the bridges between Bang and Greg-McKerrow were not blown up. On the contrary! Greg writes to Bang on September 26, 1906: "let us get the tedious 'Out' out which will be the best way of showing the world that we have not quarrelled". Indeed, the next year (1907) their editions of two quartos of Ben Jonson's Every Man out of his Humor (editors: W. Bang &amp; W. W. Greg) appeared in the Materialien . And Bang himself went as far as to publish The Tragical Reign of Selimus 1594 (1908) in the Reprints of Greg's Malone Society. Greg and McKerrow, on the other hand, continued publishing in Bang's series. 13 With the outbreak of the war in 1914, Bang had to return to Germany and did not come back to Louvain after the hostilities were over. His successor at the university, Mgr. H. De Vocht, stayed in correspondence with Greg and McKerrow. From 1927 onwards he continued Bang's series under the English title Materials for the Study of the Old English Drama . We can hope Bang's letters to Greg and McKerrow about editorial matters will emerge one day, but even the one-way correspondence at our disposal makes evident the international importance of the first Louvain professor of English language and literature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX: Letters 1. Letter from A. W. Pollard to W. Bang 14 10 Lauriston Road. Wimbledon. July 15 th 1906. Dear Sir, Mr. Greg has told me of your letter to him concerning the projected English Dramatic Text Society &amp; as I think I have corresponded with you before, I am bold enough to wish to confess that if there is any criminality in trying to form such a Society I am the main culprit. I want also to say that if there is any method open to us of showing respect for the work you have accomplished, or of diminishing competition, or of helping the sale of the texts you have already published, it will be a real pleasure to me, &amp; I am sure to others also, to do the utmost we can in this direction without sacrificing our own freedom to bring out English Editions of any texts we think are wanted, &amp; to enlist the aid of the best English workers available for this purpose. To be quite frank, I will own that if it had not been for Messrs. Farmer &amp; Gibbings and their Early English Drama Society I should not have been so keen as I am in this matter. But I am sure that you will yourself see how galling it is to anyone who cares for the honour of English scholarship to allow it to be said that work like Mr. Farmer's [is canceled ] finds a ready success in England, while genuine scholars like Mr. Greg and Mr McKerrow have to take their work abroad to find print &amp; paper. There is also the further point that we are so used in England to doing this kind of work by means of Societies that I am quite sure that we can enlist the interest of scores of people in these studies whom it would be quite impossible for you to reach, however much you spent on advertising. It may even be that the interest we shall arouse will react favourably on your own venture &amp; get you new subscribers. As for the larger plan which you suggest, that of forming a Tudor &amp; Stuart Text Society I am immensely taken with it, but the difficulty in finding Editors to work it would be very great. It is [im canceled ] possible that our present plan might take on [ next word interlined ] ultimately this larger form, but if we decide to begin with the dramatic texts I hope you won't take the decision as in any sense a mark of personal hostility to yourself. I remain, very fathfully y rs Alfred W Pollard (British Museum) Professor Bang. 15 2. Letter from W. W. Greg to W. Bang 16 High Elms Farnboro', R.S.O. Kent. July 17.06. Dear Prof. Bang I take the opportunity of being on a visit + 17 away from work to reply to your letter of just a month ago. You will I believe have had a letter from A. W. Pollard to whom I showed yours, + who was I believe the original inventor of our scheme. I mention this to show that I am only acting as one of a committee, but at the same time I do not in any way wish to shirk responsibility in connection with the affair, especially as upon me will most likely devolve the main task of running the Society. Now I want you to believe that [that canceled ] it is not from any motive of personal consequence, or any desire for [ illegible word ] recognition, that I am embarking on this enterprise. I should not expect + I should not desire any more prominent mention in connection with the Materialien. The organization + the responsibility of that undertaking rest with you + it is only right that you should receive whatever Kudos attaches to it. Nor should I desire any special arrangements to be made as to remuneration. I shall not get any money out of the proposed society, so you will see that your kind offer of special terms cannot influence my decision. You seem by the way to have got a slightly inaccurate idea, no doubt through my want of clearness, as to the scope + objects of the new Society. It is not proposed to start a society for the purpose of editing some 15 plays, as you seem to think--parturiunt montes nascitur +c!--but [ next word interlined above canceled with] in the hope of producing some ten plays a year, + I look forward to its continuing for ten years at least. Well, I suppose the question does resolve itself into a national one au fond . I quite agree that England is well represented on your covers + I rejoice to think that English scholars should have given their support to so deserving an undertaking. It would be desastrous if we were to refuse co-operation because work was initiated + organized by foreign enthusiasts. The fact that you value my support as you say you do--though I am afraid you greatly over-rate its value--should show that I do not approach the question in a narrow spirit. While the work of English scholarship is left to foreigners they will have my whole hearted support, but that does not prevent my holding that the work ought to be done by us Englishmen ourselves, as an English affair--I dont [ sic ] of course mean a monopoly--+ that the importance of [a canceled ] waking English men up to a sense of their responsibilities in the matter is such as to outweigh all minor considerations. Now, we have our prejudices over here, some well founded, others not, but all held pretty strongly, + this fact is one which has to be recognised + reconed [ sic ] with. And I am sorry to say that a foreign series of monographs on English literature will not wake up Englishmen to a sense of the situation. Of course I quite understand the annoyance you must feel on the subject of the maison à coté + I really sympathize with you + regret the annoyance deeply. You have also I think special reason to be angry with me. I originally met your schemes with mistrust + it was largely, though not entirely, through working for you that I became converted to your methods of facsimile reprint--+now I propose to take a leaf out of your book! It is hard, I admit. I can only repeat that the importance of the end seems to me to outweigh all personal considerations, + beg you to think as well of me as you can. I have not yet touched on the question of the practical effect that the Materialien + our Society may have on one another because I think that the decision must be taken on other grounds. It is possible that our scheme may injure you--if so I shall regret it, but I shall not cease to think that we are right in starting. But are you not inclined to take too gloomy a view? Are you sure there is not room for both? On the whole there will I think be little cause to come into conflict--at least for the present--+I am sure that it will always be the desire of the Society to avoid doing so. I am sure too that we should be only too glad if we could in some way recognize the good work you have been doing [ ampersand and next six words interlined ] + the lead you have given us + help [in and illegible letters canceled ] to the best of our ability in the success of your [scheme canceled ] undertaking. That the two must however remain distinct is I fear unavoidable. Now obviously the extent to which we can assist you will depend largely upon the manner in which you are prepared to meet us. What are our relations to be? I am sure that we are all most anxious that a friendly spirit should prevail in our relations. How about you? for I quite realize that you have an excuse for feeling agrieved which we obviously could not have. For my own part I should be very sorry to close my connection with the Materialien + I hope that no such action may be necessary. I shall hope in time to achieve all the work that has been put down to my name (except the B.J. Which I had already shirked going on with). On the other hand I shall no doubt be less free to devote time to it than hitherto. In view of this I shall be quite willing to become an ordinary subscriber to the series--instead of receiving the publications free as an assistant editor or co-operator, + also if it is likely to make relations in any way easier I shall be quite willing to forgo the half profits. I do not myself see why the two [ next word uncertain ] houses should not work harmoniously side by side--+ prosper. We meet to found the Society on July 30--so if you have any practical points to raise, let me have them before that. I hear that Frank Sidgwick may be seeing you + talking over matters--so I have sent him your letter. Ever yours sincerely W. W. Greg</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Scribes, Compositors, and Annotators: The Nature of the Copy for the First Folio Text of Coriolanus by LEE BLISS *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First Folio of 1623 (hereafter F) is our sole authority for the text of what is probably Shakespeare's final tragedy, Coriolanus . With the possible exception of four bb formes (discussed below), Coriolanus was, in all accounts, set from manuscript copy. About the provenance of that manuscript, or whether it was in Shakespeare's own hand, there is less certainty and, hence, less agreement. Many editors have suggested Shakespeare's autograph papers as copy, and G. Blakemore Evans in 1974 concluded that `[t]here is general agreement that the F1 text was printed from a carefully prepared authorial manuscript, a "producer's copy" as it has been called'; he went on to assert that, `though perhaps showing one or two book-keeper's notations', it `had never served as a prompt-book'. 1 In contrast, Albert Gilman, though inclined to accept authorial copy, entertained the possibility of scribal transcript and was certain that the manuscript had `been used as a prompt-book'. 2 In his New Arden edition, Philip Brockbank was more cautious on both counts, finding it `consistent with the evidence to suppose F was set up from autograph copy, at least partly prepared by the playwright for the theatre. It is not possible to be sure that the book-keeper had or did not have a casual, occasional hand in it.' 3 More recently, in their 1987 Textual Companion to William Shakespeare: The Complete Works , the Oxford editors designate the copy as `scribal transcript (possibly of a prompt-book)'; 4 in his 1994 Oxford Shakespeare edition of Coriolanus , however, R. B. Parker concludes the manuscript beneath F was Shakespearean holograph, though he believes it was `a draft that still required revision'. 5 The two issues -- autograph or scribal copy and relation to theatrical production -- are important. We would like to know, of course, whether textual problems in F result solely from compositorial misreading or mis-setting of an authorial original, or whether another layer of possible alteration intervenes in the transcriptional processes of a scribe. Equally, we would like to know how closely the text printed in F approximates the early seventeenth-century acting script of Coriolanus . Despite earlier assertions of scholarly consensus, it clearly does not exist on either count. I will argue in the following sections, first, that Coriolanus was set from a scribal transcript and, second, that most of the apparent problems created by the F text's speech headings (SHs) and stage directions (SDs) were introduced either by the scribe or in the printing house; they should not be taken as certain evidence that the copy manuscript was not yet in a form that could serve as theatrical playbook. Before turning to the argument itself, however, two unusual features surrounding the printing of Coriolanus need to be mentioned, for in major and minor ways they affected the resulting F text. Because Coriolanus was being set into type by Compositors A and B while Compositor E was simultaneously setting the next play in this section, Titus Andronicus , the manuscript pages of Coriolanus had to be entirely `cast off' at the printing house before work on it could begin. 6 Obviously, over- or under-estimation by the man who did the casting off, especially in conjunction with the constant challenge posed by F's narrow double-column format (so inhospitable to long verse lines), could put the compositors' ingenuity to a severe test. This peculiarity in the circumstances under which Coriolanus was printed helps explain, as we shall see, some at least of the play's high incidence of mislineation, as well as some of the apparent compositorial tampering with SDs. Another peculiarity originating in the printing house is more problematic (and, for our purposes, less significant ), but worth mentioning since it may have influenced Compositor A's work on bb1 v in a minor way. Charlton Hinman notes that, given the orderly sequence generally followed in setting F, the only exception stands out: quire bb of Coriolanus . Without precedent in the prior work on the Comedies and Histories, `a beginning was made on quire kk before quire bb was finished', and the `four bb formes which we might certainly have expected just after bb3 v :4 and bb3:4 v eventually turn up between quires ll and mm'. Hinman believes the four formes may have been set in their normal order but, after suffering some physical degradation (possibly a `warehouse disaster'), they had to be replaced. If Hinman's explanation is correct, and if the damaged sheets were still legible, these four formes in F might have been reset from printed copy, returned to after `about fifteen working days after the completion of group 3'. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The F text of Coriolanus certainly seems to reflect in some of its features an authorial basis, for instance in its retention of at least one possible 'Shakespearean' spelling and, more generally, in its often full and `literary' SDs that perhaps reflect either Shakespeare's own `bridging' thoughts during composition, as he stitched together episodes from North's Plutarch into dramatic form, or a later fleshing out of brief SDs with narrative details intended to help his acting company understand the evolving, quite fast-moving and complicated, story. 8 Sweeping claims for Shakespearean spellings surviving into the printed texts have been rightly challenged, but there is more critical agreement about one spelling predeliction that does appear in Coriolanus . 9 In the fragment of the manuscript Booke of Sir Thomas More by Hand D, thought by many to be Shakespearean autograph, the noun silence is spelled with an sc , scilens ; the sc preference reappears in scattered earlier texts of Shakespeare plays thought to have been set from `foul papers' — Scilens for Justice Silence in the SHs of quarto 2 Henry IV , Sceneca for Seneca in the 1604 quarto of Hamlet , scylence in quarto Troilus and Cressida (altered by the press-corrector to sylence ) — as well as in the three occurrences of Scicion for Sicyon in F Antony and Cleopatra . 10 In Coriolanus one of the tribunes consistently appears as Scicinius in SDs and, in abbreviated form, in SHs in Compositor A's stints and, presumably by oversight, twice in Compositor B's ( Scic ., Scicin .). Compositor A is generally thought more trustworthy in following copy (except in matters of lineation), B more prone to alter and regularise, so it is likely that the Sc form stood in the manuscript from which Coriolanus was set. 11 Yet while features of Hand D in Sir Thomas More may be significant (and will be referred to elsewhere in this essay because of that possibility), there is no incontrovertible evidence that Hand D is Shakespeare's. 12 Nor is it certain, even if Shakespeare could be shown to have preferred sc in the spelling of one word, that he would necessarily transfer that preference to other 'morphologically' similar words. 13 The sc spellings of Scicinius in Coriolanus thus do not settle the question of F copy with which we began, although the other instances of sc for s in Shakespearean texts of different provenance suggest that it is more likely to be authorial than scribal. 14 Two other Coriolanus spellings that have been suggested as distinctively Shakespearean — shoot for shout and arrant for errand 15 — are not unusual enough sixteenth- and seventeenth-century spellings to mark them as peculiarly Shakespearean. Stage directions that exceed the needs of a book-holder include 1.3's informative introduction of the women, specifying their relationship to the protagonist as well as their immediate physical actions: Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife to Martius: | They set them downe on two low stooles and sowe . Titus Lartius' movements are twice tracked with some care: at 1.9.11/759, Enter Titus with his Power, from the Pursuit , 16 and the elaborate opening SD of 1.7 that locates the action in time and space, in its F form nearly half as long as the scene itself: Titus Lartius, having set a guard upon Carioles, going with | Drum and Trumpet toward Cominius and Caius Mar- | tius, Enters with a Lieutenant, other Souldiours, and a | Scout . Other SDs display a literary turn of phrase, as when two officers enter at the beginning of 2.2 to lay cushions, as it were, in the Capitoll , or 1.6 where Cominius enters as it were in retire, with soldiers , or when Coriolanus makes his final entrance in 5.6, the Commoners being with him . Some are `literary' in the most literal sense, having been lifted almost verbatim from the section of North's Plutarch that Shakespeare was at that moment casting in dramatic form: at 1.4.29/523 the Romans are beat back to their Trenches , and at 4.4.0 Coriolanus enters in meane Aparrell, Dis - | guisd, and muffled . 17 Some elements of Shakespeare's original papers thus survive in the 1623 printed text, although this does not necessarily mean the compositors had Shakespeare's own hand before them rather than a scribal transcript faithful to at least some features of the original. Although it is impossible to distinguish with complete certainty between scribal and authorial copy, several aspects of the F text suggest the manuscript was not Shakespearean holograph. The Oxford Textual Companion has gathered a number of these features as evidence for its argument that printer's copy for Coriolanus was a scribal transcript. The preponderance of ha's over has and, less decisively, do's or doe's over does is uncharacteristic. 18 The contracted form a'th' occurs much more frequently in Coriolanus than in any other Shakespeare play (27 times; the next closest play, All's Well that Ends Well , is itself unusually high with 9 occurrences); it and its alternative o'th' are also found in work by both compositors. 19 While o'th' is not uncommon, especially in Shakespeare's late style, a'th' is unusual. 20 Two other contracted forms in Coriolanus might be added to this list, and, although it is only a remote possibility, the first may even derive from an idiosyncratic Shakespearean spelling. In Sir Thomas More 's three pages by Hand D, we find one example of tooth (= to th' ). 21 All ten of Compositor A's forms of this contraction in Coriolanus are spelled toth' , and he also uses this spelling (in five out of six instances) in Macbeth ; yet since it does not appear in the other eight F plays on which he worked, this is unlikely to be his preference imposing itself. (Compositor B resists this form: all 11 of his spellings in Coriolanus are to'th' .) The probable explanation is that the scribes for Coriolanus and Macbeth (who do not, on other evidence, appear to have been the same man) were either tolerant enough of tooth to only semi-modernise it or, less likely, themselves preferred toth' . Another rarity in F plays, in this case almost certainly scribal, lies in the four occurrences of it's (three set by Compositor B, one by A). Tis is by far the more usual form of this contraction, and the only other F play with this number of it's is Henry VIII , set from scribal transcript. 22 It may also be worth noting that two misprints in which a capital `I' has been misread as capital `A' — Annius Brutus for Iunius Brutus in the SD at 1.1.226/244 and `Athica' for `Ithica' at 1.3.43/447 — suggest that in the copy's manuscript hand these forms may have been easily confused. If Hand D in Sir Thomas More is Shakespeare's, such a misreading would be unlikely; both capitals appear there, and they are quite distinct. 23 If Hand D in the More manuscript is Shakespeare's, his punctuation was light almost to the point of non-existence: in these three pages there are no colons, round brackets, exclamation or interrogation marks, and `an average of one comma to every five lines, a lower ratio than in any of the Good Quartos, and about one-sixth of the rate of use in a normally punctuated First Folio text'. 24 Absent punctuation could easily lead astray a copyist trying to make sense of, and mark, the syntactical units in such a manuscript. 25 Some of the relatively heavy and sophisticated pointing in Coriolanus was probably added in the printing house: apostrophes indicating elision of a letter, which on the evidence of Hand D in More Shakespeare indicated by spelling alone; 26 some at least of the colons, semicolons, brackets, additional commas, marks of interrogation and exclamation, as well as emphasis capitals. 27 It is unclear who is responsible for the probable purging of the contracted spelling in words for which the meter requires syncopation or slurring; of the many, many instances of full-spelling words that need to be reduced by a syllable in delivery, only a handful remain so indicated in Coriolanus , most with what are presumably added apostrophes: suffring (TLN 877), temp'rately (1144, 1934), paltring (1745), marv'llous (2682), utt'rance (3140), murd'ring (3412), wond'ring (3768). 28 Compositorial sophistication does not sufficiently explain a number of uncharacteristic features of Coriolanus 's punctuation, however. The high incidence of certain unusual contractions, clipped forms, and pseudo-grammatical apostrophes ( ha's , doe's ), noted above, all point away from Shakespearean holograph for the F manuscript copy. 29 In some of its other punctuation too — notably in exclamation marks and round brackets — Coriolanus is untypical. Since Compositor B `heavily interfered with the punctuation of his copy', in this matter he makes an unrelaible indicator; 30 it is to the more conservative Compositor A that we should look for signs that the copy manuscript was already generously pointed. In Compositor A's work in F, excluding The Winter's Tale (a Ralph Crane transcript that would be rich in brackets), he worked on nine plays and set 112 brackets in 104 pages. 31 At this rate, in Coriolanus Compositor A was setting nearly double his usual number per page, and in fact his rate is nearly that of Compositor B, whose slightly higher average of 2.1 per page probably reflects his tendency to add his own brackets to those he found in his copy. Compositor A's heavier than normal use of round brackets (13 in all) suggests scribal rather than authorial copy, since he does not seem to add them on his own initiative. On the other hand, Compositor A seems to have resisted exclamation marks: there are only nine in 120 pages of his work in F, and he omitted all six in setting from printed copy for F Richard II . 32 That there is only one such mark in his seven and one-quarter pages of Coriolanus is not surprising, though his resistance makes it highly likely that the mark stood in his copy and fairly likely that there were more that he suppressed. In Compositor B's pages there are 13, and even though some of them may be his own additions, it is also probable that he was encouraged by the presence of exclamation marks in his copy. On the basis of his work from printed copy, at least slightly over half the exclamation marks in B's pages of Coriolanus came from his copy. 33 One would not expect any in a manuscript in Shakespeare's hand. The nature of the mislineation in Coriolanus suggests that here, too, both compositors and scribe contributed errors to what was probably in this respect an already confusing original manuscript. If Hand D in More is a reliable guide, Shakespeare was himself misleading: he did not capitalise the initial letter of a verse line, and he tended to crowd the concluding part-line of a speech onto the preceding line to save space at the bottom of a page. In the three pages of More , there are three examples of mislineation. 34 Inaccurately cast-off copy could push both compositors to purposefully alter their copy: in some cases cramming one and one-half lines onto one line of type, in others needlessly splitting lines to take up space, as well as relining verse as prose and prose as verse. As Paul Werstine points out, Compositor B is in general more faithful to his copy's verse lineation than A, though A is more reliable in lining prose. Compositor A's unreliability with verse frequently stems from his apparent dislike of enjambment and preference for emphasising syntactical structure; as a consequence, he was more than willing to relineate on his own to create end-stopped verse. 35 In such circumstances, Compositor B's pages are more likely to indicate the extent to which the manuscript behind Coriolanus was itself ambiguous or erroneous. The same ambiguities in lineation in the Hand D pages of More were apparently frequent in the F copy for Coriolanus : there, Compositor B `mislined more verse passages containing short lines than he did in all the rest of the plays he shared with A'. 36 Most probably not all instances stood in his copy, since he was also using mislined verse as a way to save and waste space, yet the examples of F Hamlet and Antony and Cleopatra , where combined verses are spread across the stints of both compositors and which were not set from cast-off copy, `makes it evident that the source of the combined verses in all three plays probably lies beyond the commpositors'. 37 Werstine concludes that the high incidence of mislineation in Hamlet is at least in part scribal, since it is generally agreed that a transcript underlies the F version of that play, and speculates that the same may be true for Coriolanus and Antony . 38 Some inconsistencies in the naming of characters in SDs and SHs may take us, from another direction, a bit closer to distinguishing between an authorial or scribal origin for the printing- house copy of Coriolanus . Certainly, those for Titus Lartius have not been standardised. Not only does reference to him vary between Tit . or abbreviations of Lartius in SHs ( Lart ., Lar .), but he is also once addressed as Titus Lucius within a speech (1.1.239/262), becomes Titus Latius in the SD at 2.1.161/1060 and, later, Titus Latius in the entry direction and Latius as SH throughout 3.1. The first misnaming, at 1.1.239/262, is by Compositor B, the others by A. In the first case, hasty and therefore slightly illegible script, with an open a and a dropped or extremely abbreviated r , might have produced Lucius , since t is easily mistaken for c in secretary hand. Given the other occurrences of Latius , however, it is perhaps more likely that this is what the compositor misread as Lucius . In Compositor A's stints, the SD in 2.1 might be a simple misreading, again due to ambiguous copy; he had correctly set Titus Lartius 35 lines earlier on the same page. Yet it is also possible that Latius stood in the manuscript here, too, either in Shakespeare's hand or carefully copied by a scribe. The edition of North's Plutarch almost certainly used by Shakespeare, that of 1595, mentions this figure, described as `one of the valliantest men the ROMANES had at that time', only once in the text, as Titus Latius ; in North's marginal comment the designation is Titus Lartius, a valliant Romaine . 39 Both spellings may have stuck in Shakespeare's mind, even though he had provisionally settled on one and used it as the dominant form in Act 1. 40 As Shakespeare moved on from the conquest of Corioles, the only part of Plutarch in which Titus is specifically involved, and also into scenes of his own creating — Coriolanus' triumphant return to Rome in 2.1 and a new setting (3.1) for the Plutarchan speech in which Coriolanus argues against giving corn to the people — the distinction between `Latius' and `Lartius' may have become blurred and one form substituted for the other when his mind was concentrated elsewhere. In 2.1 Titus has no speaking part; indeed, in Shakespeare's own chronology of the story, Titus should not be in Rome at all. His presence is needed for the visual effect of the tableau of military heroes Menenius defines as the `three, that Rome should dote on' (2.1.187/1096). If Latius did stand in the copy SD, it would in this scenario represent an authorial lapse corresponding to Shakespeare's inattention in narrative terms to where he had recently sent Titus at the end of 1.9, back to Corioles. 41 The beginning of 3.1 is a slightly different case, but one that may point to Compositor A setting from scribal copy. Titus Latius not only appears in the entry direction, but he is for twenty lines the focus of Coriolanus' attention and has five speeches, all with the SH Latius . Yet although the mistake seems of greater magnitude here, its repeated occurrence requires only a single appearance of Latius in the entry direction. That is, this could be another momentary lapse, as at 2.1.161/1060, since Titus' role in this long scene is not in fact prominent at all: he gives his information about Aufidius and on the page, and perhaps in the author's mind, disappears. While a significant character earlier in the play, he now no longer has anything specific to say or do; he is given no exit direction. Modern editors, and producers, usually leave him on stage to contribute shouts to the patrician cause and general chaos; they take him off [ with others ] at 3.1.252/1980, since some of the `Gentry' and senators apparently leave then, but F provides specific exits for only Coriolanus and Cominius. 42 If Titus and his bit of information were not upppermost in Shakespeare's mind as he built to the first climax, the breakdown of the Roman political process, then Latius might have found its way into the entry direction. If the variable SHs in other plays thought to be set from foul papers are indicative of Shakespearean practice, or the decremental SHs in Sir Thomas More ( other , oth , o ; or Lincolne , Linco , Linc , Lin ), the original manuscript SHs may have been severely abbreviated. 43 The five Latius SHs on bb1v might then be a scribal attempt to fill out that form or forms (possibly as brief as La or L ) by copying the one full spelling in the entry SD. Compositor B goes immediately to short forms; the more conscientious, or more cautious, A tends to follow copy, especially in his early work on a new text, and he is probably setting out in full what his copy offered. 44 Backtracking slightly to establish Compositor A's work habits may help clarify the grounds of the argument here and lend support to the case for scribal copy. On his first page of Coriolanus , aa4, Compositor A's use of the full form SHs of both Lartius and Martius (and of Brutus on aa5 v and aa6), 45 longer forms than B for Auffi . or Auffid . and Sould . (B sets Auf . and Sol . or Soul .), as well as his departure from his usual spelling preference for blood to set instead two bloud and one bloudie , 46 all suggest a cautious new-comer's attempt to follow unfamiliar copy; he also here prints one of the play's two Omnes SHs. 47 If I am correct, the scribe expanded and regularised his author's various SH abbreviations. Compositor A, at least initially, fairly conscientiously follows suit; on aa4 he experiments with abbreviations only for the longer SHs which obviously could not be accommodated to F's two-column format. By 3.1 (bb1 v ), however, he had set five and one-quarter of his seven and one-quarter pages, and his earlier full SHs now tended toward shorter forms: Brut ., Cor . and Corio . (but no longer Coriol .). Yet Compositor A had not attended to Coriolanus for some period of time, since after bb4 v a good deal of other F work intervened. 48 While he remembered and abbreviated Brutus to Brut ., his only prior acquaintance with Titus as a speaking character on stage had been on his very first page, aa4. By the time he set bb1 v , Compositor A had either forgotten or was now unsure about Lartius / Latius , and he followed the scribal expansion to Latius for each instance, as he had on aa4 when faced with new characters. That Compositor B, who moves immediately to shortened forms on his first page, aa3 v ( Lar . and Lart .), should among ten Mar . and one Mart . on that page include a Martius might suggest that his copy, too, presented him with fuller SH forms. Thus while Compositor A was quite capable of himself lifting the SD Latius from the entry direction for 3.1, rather than the scribe I have posited, the other full-form SHs noted above (and especially where in the compositors' stints they appear) suggest that in the copy manuscript at least those as short as Lartius , Martius , and Brutus were recorded in full. On the basis of the Hand D pages in Sir Thomas More and of the practice of the good quartos, this would be uncharacteristic for Shakespeare. In the series of SHs for Coriolanus on aa5, Thomas Clayton has seen the decremental prefixes characteristic of Hand D in More , and he takes the similarity as evidence that the manuscript copy for F Coriolanus was Shakespearean holograph. 49 This is one of the very few pages on which such a claim could be based, but since it also offers spellings and sophistications not connected with Compositor A's practice elsewhere, 50 it seems advisible at least to consider alternative explanations. Certainly this page, especially in the second column, is replete with errors, many of which appear to derive from misreading, but some at least might as easily be scribal as compositorial: Latius for Lartius in the SD at TLN 1060, Com . for Cor . at TLN 1087, and possibly the mislineation of Coriolanus' first two speeches as prose and the duplicate Martius Caius in TLN 1066-67. (Mislineation from TLN 1088 to the bottom of the page is clearly compositorial, stretching copy to waste space.) While this is Compositor A's third page, it is the first on which he needs SHs for `Coriolanus', and what look like `Shakespearean' decremental prefixes may be connected with Compositor A irregularly working toward his own preferred form. He sets Herauld in full, then two Coriol ., each of which heads verse set as prose. Whether he or the scribe was responsible for the mislineation here, perhaps the look of these long lines, coupled with the fact that the intervening SH is Com ., convinced Compositor A he was going to need a shorter form to accommodate long verse lines. (He had adopted the short form Com . immediately on aa4, his first page, probably because Cominius' first two speeches there begin with long lines.) The next Coriolanus SH is Corio ., followed by three Cor ., although none of these lines presented problems with justification. On Compositor A's next page with this SH, aa6, the first two instances are Coriol . again, but at TLN 1288 a long first verse line pushes him to Corio ., and this becomes his preferred form, from which he departs only twice (one Cori . required for justification on bb1, one random Cor . on bb1 v ). Compositor B's practice on his first page with Coriolanus SHs (aa6 v ) is puzzling, but, while he is much less trustworthy in reflecting copy spellings than A, one feature suggests that Coriol . was at least the usual copy form. He sets one Corio ., one Coriol ., then seven Corio . However, when the first group of citizens in 2.3 exits and the second enters, at TLN 1475, his treatment of both citizens and Coriolanus changes anomalously. The citizens are reduced to numbers, where previously on this page they had been `I. Cit .', `2. Cit .', etc.; although B is under no apparent pressure to stretch his copy here, Coriolanus is Coriol . for all his remaining five speeches in the second column. For the rest of the play Compositor B adopts Corio . ( Cor . only for justification). The remainder of 2.3 (on bb1) was set by Compositor A, who had by now settled on Corio . himself, and Compositor A restores `I. Cit .' and `2. Cit .'. Compositor B's dual departure from his usual practice almost suggests that someone else finished his stint on aa6 v . More probably, the anomaly is the string of what I take to be the copy form, even though he had begun to settle on the more economical Corio . Suddenly reducing the citizens to numbers for a half column in the middle of this scene does not save space, and perhaps the copy manuscript was itself inconsistent in handling citizen SHs. It seems more likely, however, that on a page consisting largely of speeches by various citizens and Coriolanus, many of them rapid exchanges, Compositor B feared he would run out of the letter C . Even more unShakespearean than the copy's full- or long-form SHs that I am positing, but cannot prove, are the two instances of the SH Omnes demonstrably there (1, noted above, set by Compositor A at 1.9.67/823 on his first page, 1 by B at 4.6.138/3065). As a SH, Omnes is extremely rare in F: its only other occurrences are in Antony and Cleopatra (6: 2 set by Compositor E, 4 by B). 51 Whether Omnes appeared consistently in the manuscript and was almost completely purged in the printing house, as is possible, we cannot tell; the usual SH in substantive Shakespearean texts (and Hand D's practice in More ), however, is All . Coriolanus has an extraordinarily high number of `crowd' speeches: 30 All SHs, not counting the lightly differentiated All Lords , All Consp ., All Ple ., All People . It would not be surprising that with so many to set, each compositor should have let one slip through on a page with no other All SHs to alert him. 52 An alternative explanation would be that a printing house editor went over the copy first, marking it to bring it into conformity with the general style decided on for F (which seems to have allowed Omnes to stand in exit directions but not as a SH), and missed these two instances, which both compositors then dutifully reproduced. In either case, Omnes is likely to have been the copy's form, and this suggests scribal sophistication rather than Shakespearean autograph. The latter explanation might seem better to fit the oddity produced by Compositor B in the exit direction at 3.3.135/2424: Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, with Cumalijs . This (misread) Latin sophistication, too, seems to have been against Jaggard's house style: the only other F instance is the Cumalijs in Hamlet in the entry direction for 2.2, also set by Compositor B. (What was a Cum Alijs in Q2 Hamlet at 1.2.0.3, in F has become Lords Attendant .) It looks as though the Coriolanus manuscript copy had been marked, though perhaps only cursorily, for in the first column of this page, bb4, Compositor B has set Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, and Comi- | nius, with others (and elsewhere with others twice). By the bottom of the second column, however, he was having trouble making sense of his copy (resulting in mislineation and mispunctuation) and seems to have come upon an un- or lightly-crossed-out cum alijs (possibly with little or no space between words) that had a with over it or in the margin. 53 Mistaking the Latin tag for a one-word proper name, he tacked on both words at the end of the exit direction. In this case, however, the Latinism may have been the playhouse book-keeper's rather than the scribe's. 54 The last feature of Coriolanus to be considered is not certain evidence of scribal origin, but it seems appropriate to discuss it in this section: the fact that Coriolanus is divided into acts (although not, after Actus Primus. Scoena Prima ., into scenes). For public theatre plays written before about 1607 this feature, along with the Finis that follows the printed text, is usually taken to indicate the sophistication of a scribe or, possibly, later annotation for stage or publication. 55 Private theatre plays were regularly marked with act division, since noting the intervals in which music or dancing took place was a significant feature of their playbooks; later public theatre plays also show this mark of sophistication. If composed in 1608, Coriolanus falls into a transitional stage in the practice of dividing public theatre plays into acts: before 1607, in plays for the adult companies only Jonson's are so divided; by about 1616 the practice is universal. 56 Gary Taylor dismisses as unlikely the explanation that a sudden change in fashion led London publishers to impose their own act division when presented with undivided theatrical copy; rather, he argues for a change in theatrical practice — from continuous playing to performance with four intervals — initiated for the King's Men by their acquisition of the Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608. 57 Although the King's Men did not start playing at Blackfriars until late 1609 or early 1610, Coriolanus may be the first of Shakespeare's plays composed with it in mind as a potential venue, an indoor theatre where act intervals were a common practice. Unlike the scenic construction usual in earlier Shakespeare plays, even as recently as Antony and Cleopatra , Coriolanus seems structured in a five-act movement: exposition and Coriolanus' military success, ending with Shakespeare's addition to Plutarch, a scene in the Volscian camp in which Aufidius announces his envy and intention to defeat Coriolanus by `wrath or craft'; Coriolanus' triumphal return to Rome, nomination to the consulship, and the plebeians' initial confirmation, ending with the tribunes convincing the citizens to rescind their vote; Act 3's descent into near civil war and, on the tribunes' urging, Coriolanus' banishment; in Act 4, Coriolanus' defection to the Volscians, Rome's reception of the news that both Aufidius and Coriolanus are joined against it, concluding with Aufidius' analysis of Coriolanus' character and vow to destroy his present co-general; finally, the series of pleas for mercy by friends and family that culminates in Coriolanus' confrontation with his mother and decision to spare Rome, followed by Aufidius' long-predicted revenge, the murder of Coriolanus. 58 Indeed, two of what I suspect to be scenes added or at least expanded in the process of revision (the final scene of Act 1 and, especially, the final scene of Act 4) accentuate the formal breaks by returning to Aufidius; they strengthen the contrast between him and Coriolanus and focus our attention on questions of character rather than physical prowess. These unPlutarchan scenes also counterpoise the protagonist's apparent progression throughout each of these acts toward acknowledged superiority and public acclaim, first in Rome and then among the Volscians. Acts 2 and 3 are virtually continuous in action but so structured that Act 3 replays in a more desperate key Act 2's movement: apparent civic success cut short not only by Coriolanus' own behaviour but by the tribunes' stratagems. Whether the actual notations were first entered in the hand of the author, scribe, or playhouse annotator, Shakespeare composed Coriolanus so as to be playable with intervals that reinforced its structure. Paul Werstine has argued against the hope fostered by R. B. McKerrow and W. W. Greg of establishing behind Shakespeare's printed texts `the author's original draft', and he also points out that there are `now thought to be considerably more scribal transcripts than holographs' among the surviving manuscript playbooks. 59 In 1956 Philip Williams suggested that a scribal transcript underlies Coriolanus , although he never published the evidence for this conclusion. 60 The Oxford editors in 1987 listed several features, to which I have referred, that led them to agree. Despite R. B. Parker's return to a supposition of Shakespearean holograph, then, I hope that the present discussion has contributed to the evidence for scribal copy as the basis for F Coriolanus . After we have considered whether irregularities in SHs and SDs disqualify this manuscript copy from representing the King's Men's playbook for theatrical production, the concluding section of the essay will turn to the question of when that transcript might have been made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Since indefinite SHs or variable SHs for the same character, combined with the misassignment or misplacement of other SHs, have been taken as one sign that a play text has not yet been made fully ready for performance, we should examine Coriolanus to see how many difficulties they would actually have presented and at what point in the transmission these irregularities are likely to have entered the F text. Although SHs vary, they would not in general have baffled the book-keeper. Those that reflect one or the other of Titus Lartius' names, or variant abbreviations for Coriolanus, Menenius, and Aufidius, present no problem. Most indefinite SHs, such as Both (four in 2.1; one in 2.3; two in 4.5), are clear from context (the two tribunes in 2.1; the two citizens on stage at 2.3.111/1502; First and Second Servingman in 4.5); the Exeunt both at 4.6.148/3076 obviously refers to Menenius and Cominius and may have even specified them in the manuscript, since Compositor B was clearly pressed for space here and could not afford a two-line SD. A couple would need to be decided in rehearsal or, more probably, in making up the `plot' and the individual actor's parts: which two of the three women on stage should speak the words assigned to `2 Ladies ', at 2.1.107/1004, and does Tri . at 4.6.120/3042 mean Both Tri . (which appears at 4.6.26/2924) or just one, where either one will do? A both that has proved troublesome to some editors appears in the SD Draw both the Conspirators, and kils Martius, who | falles, Auffidius stands on him (5.6.130/3804), since the entry direction had been for 3 or 4 Conspirators of Auffidius Faction . Brockbank suggests two possibilities: that the two SDs were in different hands, the entry direction by Shakespeare and the other by the book-keeper `witnessing to a performance that made do with two conspirators', or that a book-keeper annotated an authorial original with both ; but he concludes a book-keeper's responsibility for both is unlikely. 61 I agree that both SDs appear authorial but do not think the latter would have presented any production problem, since both could at this time also refer to more than two. 62 Such vagueness about minor characters seems characteristic of Shakespeare's habits during composition. In Hand D's three pages of Sir Thomas More , four speeches are assigned to other (which shrinks to oth and o ); the revising playhouse scribe known as Hand C deleted all four instances and substituted characters' names. In Coriolanus such authorial indifference may lie behind the mixture of numbered and unnumbered senatorial speakers in 1.1 (where the first two are `I. Sen .' but two more are unnumbered), 2.2 (the first is `I. Sen .', the other four unspecified), and the jumbling of numbered and unnumbered senators in 3.1, or the wholly unnumbered soldiers in 1.10. Some of the undesignated senators might be the result of scribal or compositorial oversight, but they span both compositors' stints and most probably reflect Shakespeare's thinking in terms of effective crowd scenes (like other in More ), where anonymous voices issue from different parts of the group. 63 The four undesignated soldier-speakers in 1.10 may have been intended for a similar effect, although in this case Shakespeare might have left them to be dealt with when the play was cast and the number of available soldiers known, since the SD has Aufidius entering with two or three Souldiors . 64 There are F plays whose underlying copy is thought to have been annotated in consultation with a promptbook that contain speeches for unspecified (except by function) minor characters, like the gardener's two servants and Queen's two ladies in Richard II . 65 Paul Werstine has noted similar ambiguities and even a mixture of both specified and unnumbered SHs in the surviving manuscript playbooks. 66 No one has deemed it necessary to normalise the various designations for the opposed classes in different scenes. Classical Rome and seventeenth-century England co-exist comfortably in SDs where the entering Citizens of 1.1 are both Citizens and Plebeians in 2.3, a rabble of Plebeians as well as the People in 3.1, and back to Citizens in 4.6, while their Volscian counterparts in 5.6 are the Commoners . The Patricians are also all the Gentry in 3.1, Nobles in 3.2, and some of them the yong Nobility of Rome in 4.1. The terms may slide between civilizations, but the class status and relationship remain the same and clear, hence there was no need to tamper with them. Immediate function within the scene being composed seems to have governed the terms that came to mind. So in 4.3 the entry direction and SHs are for a Roman and a Volce , despite the fact that each soldier is named in the dialogue. The important point is that one is a traitor to Rome, reporting Rome's troubles to the enemy he now joins, in a scene immediately preceding Coriolanus' arrival in Antium seeking Aufidius. The frequent SH All , too, has been left largely untouched, although in only a few cases can it be taken literally as requiring everyone on stage to speak at once. Some disambiguation has been (rather intermittently) undertaken, by author or theatrical annotator, for we do find one All Ple . in 3.1 (where on this principle many more differentiated All s are needed), and All Lords , All People , and All Consp . in 5.6. All is a common SH in promptbook texts, and it seems to have been conventional to leave what it might mean in individual cases to be worked out in the playhouse. 67 All might signify nearly everyone on stage speaking in unison, as when Coriolanus is celebrated by Omnes shouting his new full name in 2.1, or more restrictively, when only the plebeians chant `It shall be so' when the tribunes declare Coriolanus' banishment at 3.3.106/2407. At times the words it labels should be distributed as widely a possible, as in the breakdown of order in Corioles when All People turn against Coriolanus and should individually cry out what is run together in the text: `Teare him to peeces, do it presently: | He kill'd my Sonne, my daughter, he kill'd my Cosine | Marcus, he kill'd my Father.' (5.6.120-22/3793-95). Other possible rehearsal decisions, as E. A. J. Honigmann observes, include distributing parts of an All speech to consecutive speakers, as with ` All . Against him first: He's a very dog to the Commonalty.' (1.1.28-29/29-30), or giving one player the line while the rest `howl or clamour or contribute what was known as "confused noise"'. 68 Some SHs are either demonstrably wrong or missing, or have been thought to be so by some editors, but this fact is less of a bar than it might seem to the manuscript behind Coriolanus having been adequately marked to serve as playbook. Where SHs seem misassigned, some at least of the SHs cruxes facing a modern editor may have been imposed by the compositors and so not have stood in the manuscript copy at all. 69 One ambiguity that requires resolution occurs in the first breakdown of civil order, 3.1.185-87/1894-96, where after the SD They all bustle about Coriolanus the first two lines of what must be `crowd' noises appear with no SH (`Tribunes, Patricians, Citizens: what ho: | Sicinius, Brutus, Coriolanus, Citizens.'); the previous speaker was `2 Sen .', but the words are unlikely to be meant as his. The subsequent line, TLN 1896, reads ` All . Peace, peace, peace, stay, hold, peace'. Thomas Clayton offers various explanations, including the possibility that it is not in fact an error because All is implicit in the SD. Or, the cause might be an authorial SH `entered, after composition, in the wrong place'; if the error was introduced later by compositor or scribe, it `could be due to simple omission of one of two intended uses of All '. 70 It is also possible that two similar-looking SHs were in the copy and that only one reached print, perhaps because scribe or compositor read them as identical and consciously or subconsciously rejected the repetition. In this hypothesis, TLN 1894-95 were prefixed All and 1896 assigned to the Aediles, of which there seem to be at least three on stage. If that were the case, the All at 1894 was omitted and Aed . misread as All . 71 In another category of SH problems, some, though perhaps not all, of what modern editors take to be inaccurately labeled speeches may also have been introduced by scribe or compositor. Confusion between Cominius and Coriolanus in SHs may have been caused by misreading abbreviations ( Cor and Com ); this would be even more likely if the Shakespearean original contained (or moved quickly to) such severely shortened forms as Co and Co . 72 The greeting of Valeria after the triumphal return to Rome in 2.1 (TLN 1087) is by F assigned Com .; almost all modern editions adopt Theobald's reassignment to Coriolanus on the grounds that the line is clearly his. It is at this point in the text that the SHs for the title character switch, and as Brockbank notes, `it is likely that the transition from Mar . to Cor . made the slip or misreading Com . easier'. 73 If I am right about the F manuscript being scribal, and by a scribe who preferred full- or amply-abbreviated SHs (probably to make them line up evenly on the page), then this misreading was the scribe's; his own SH was likely to have been Coriol ., which does appear in F ten times. If he was not consistent with his SH choices, however, and if his r and m were more easily confused than those in Hand D of More (and in most secretary hands they are confusables), then the misreading could be compositorial. The same misreading of a Cor . SH as Com . is probably responsible for what is in F a rebuke of the tribune Brutus by Cominius: `You are like to doe such businesse' (3.1.48/1734). 74 A cluster of SH errors on bb2 v suggests a damaged or for some other reason illegible margin in the lower first column, or `problems associated with the printing of part of quire bb, or both'. 75 Here F assigns Cominius as the speaker of `Stand fast, we have as many friends as enemies' (3.1.230-31/1954) and to Corio . `Come Sir, along with us' (3.1.236/1961). Most editors transpose these SHs. 76 Immediately below these two errors, and linked to them in cause, F gives Mene . a five-line speech (3.1.237-41/1962-66), the first three lines of which would more properly be spoken by Coriolanus (TLN 1962-64). Brockbank suggests that the misassignment of TLN 1961 `precipitated the careless conflation' of the following lines into one speech `and its misassignment to Menenius'. 77 Rather than `carelessness', compositor or scribe might have made an `honest' mistake: the SH at TLN 1962 may have been omitted or been eradicated by damage, as might the rules separating speeches, and if the SH Mene . was floating ambiguously in the margin rather than clearly aligned with TLN 1965 at `Be gone', it might have been assumed to apply to all the apparently unassigned lines. 78 If the conflation here results from later damage to the original manuscript, then this error, like the other suspect SH assignments in bb2 v 's first column, did not affect the original playhouse production. Other SHs that have seemed problematic to later editors are less likely to have resulted from scribal or compositorial error. They might have been straightened out in the playhouse, with or without the author's help, and changed for the actors' parts. They might also have been played as they appear in F. Not all editors have emended these SHs; to some, F Coriolanus seems correct — or as likely to be correct as not — as it stands. Emendation in these cases will affect our response, as any such reassignment must, but not in significant ways for the principal characters. One common, though not universal, reassignment in 1.1 certainly alters our sense of the `Company of Mutinous Citizens'. In F the two individualised speakers for the first 55 lines are `I. Cit .' and `2. Cit .'; thereafter the character who argues so articulately with Menenius is `2. Cit .'. Clearly, this distribution suggests not only that this `Company' includes a hot-head who thinks killing Coriolanus will solve their problems, but also the more reasonable Second Citizen who becomes their natural spokesman, a man who can see the complexity of both their situation and Coriolanus's (as can other commoners later, like the three groups of citizens in 2.3, or the soldiers laying cushions in 2.2). Since Capell most editors have reassigned all of F's `2. Cit .' speeches in response to Menenius' persuasions to `I. Cit .', on the grounds that they better fit the personality of `I. Cit .' established in the scene's first 55 lines. 79 If F is in error here, the error probably stood in Shakespeare's original papers, since such a consistent scribal or compositorial misreading of `2' as `1' is highly unlikely. Thomas Clayton suggests that possibly Cit . was unnumbered in Shakespeare's manuscript, `specification to be added later or to be understood but subsequently being mis understood in the supplying of `2'. 80 But F may reflect the author's own notation; it has been defended by some editors and critics since Knight in 1851, and the play can certainly be performed according to F's assignments. 81 This seems to be a case in which F is at least as likely to be correct as not and should therefore be left alone. Other arguable editorial SH reassignments are less significant in effect, but more defensible. In the Act 3 exchange in which Menenius tries to convince the tribunes to allow Coriolanus a second chance, Hanmer (on Warburton's suggestion) reassigned one speech from F's Menen . to the tribune Sicinius: `The service of the foote | Being once gangren'd, is not then respected | For what before it was' (3.1.304-06/2045-47). In 1950 H. Eardley-Wilmot defended Hanmer's reassignment on the grounds that the metaphor is out of character for Menenius and was in a moment of inattention assigned to him by Shakespeare or compositor, and recent editions of Coriolanus reflect the persuasiveness of the arguments for Sicinius as speaker. 82 It is only fair to note, however, that most editions from Rowe (1709) to Brooke (1924) retain F, although they usually alter the final punctuation to `?' or `—' in order to make it more plausible for Menenius. 83 This is a case in which the critical arguments for reassignment are strong, but in which the F text could be played as it stands without substantively changing the relationship between Menenius and the tribunes. Another such instance is the exclamation `O the Gods!', SH Corio . in F, in the scene of Coriolanus' farewell to his family and friends (4.1.37/2477). Keightley first reassigned these words to Virgilia, but here there has been less recent agreement than for the reassignment in 3.1; of the eight post- 1950 editions sampled by Clayton, three `read with F, the other five against'. 84 The critical grounds for reassignment are cogent here, too, however. In each of his other speeches in 4.1, both before and after this ejaculation, Coriolanus argues for stoic endurance and patience as the appropriate response to his banishment. Virgilia's only F line in this scene, `Oh heavens! O heavens!' (4.1.12/2448), would make `O the Gods!' seem in character for her, and TLN 2477 would be a natural wifely outcry at Volumnia's reminder of how desperate Coriolanus' circumstance really are: `Determine on some course | More then a wilde exposture, to each chance | That start's i'th'way before thee' (4.1.35-37/2474-76). If Coriolanus does accurately reproduce the book-keeper's copy, however, its speech-assignment would not significantly alter our understanding of the protagonist. 85</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Theatrical annotation was needed to convert the original manuscript for use by the King's Men, and some of it was probably added by Shakespeare himself. As an experienced man of the theatre he certainly knew the kind of specific directions needed for stage production, and on his second run through the manuscript, he might well have contributed at least some of the play's many sound cues: the numerous instances of Flourish ; Musicke playes (4.5.0) and Sound still with the Shouts (5.4.57/3631); drum or alarum a farre off (1.4.15,19/503,509) and Alarum continues (1.4.47/546 and a similar SD at 1.5.3/572). Most of his `literary' SDs could have served adequately in a playbook and remain untouched. Both They fight, and all enter the City (1.4.62/568) and Beats him away (at 4.5.49/2703, to indicate that the Third Servingman is beaten off the stage by Coriolanus) could have been considered sufficent as exit cues. 86 Shakespeare's many indefinite entry directions, too, remain open; they range from the slightly permissive seven or eight Citizens in 2.3 or the 3 or 4 Conspirators of Auffidius Faction of 5.6, to the wholly unspecified numbers signaled by a Company of Mutinous Citizens in 1.1 through Captains and Soldiers (2.1), all the Gentry...and other Senators (3.1), to the Commoners (5.6). Study of the surviving manuscript playbooks indicates that this kind of indefiniteness was not something the book-keeper paid much attention to. 87 There was almost certainly an understood number of bodies required for with Attendants or with others (probably three), and the size of an army or rabble was probably also conventional, though it might further depend on how the doubling of parts had been worked out for this very populous play. 88 If recorded at all, changes or specification of permissive authorial SDs might have appeared only in the actor's part and the `plot', the important documents for a specific production. Indeed, SDs indefinite as to the number of players required may have offered a positive advantage, since they did not tie the playbook to a particular stage, or number of available actors, and so insured `the general adaptability of the plays for production in different playing areas'. 89 Apparently contradictory or insufficient SDs may be in part due to scribal error or compositorial oversight (in the latter case, even intentional omission, such as the situation in 1.4 and 1.8 discussed below), but some of what looks inadequate to modern eyes might not have seemed so to an early seventeenth-century book-keeper. For instance, in the elaborate entry direction for the senatorial confirmation of Coriolanus as consul in 2.2, the final words are Corio- | lanus stands (2.2.36.5/1242-43). Although he has not in the interval been directed to sit, 34 lines later we find Coriolanus rises, and offers to go away (2.2.66/1275). It is possible that a SD has been dropped by the compositor: since some of the intervening lines are verse set as prose, he may have been preoccupied with saving space and refused to give up a line (though he could have tucked it into the margin at 2.2.48/1255, where modern editors usually add it). But the direction to sit may never have been added to the playbook: simple stage action evident from dialogue — an embrace, a handclasp, the delivery of a letter or report — usually happens, in printed and manuscript plays, without accompanying SDs. There is a Kneeles for Coriolanus at 2.1.171/1075, but at Volumnia's subsequent line commanding him to rise there is nothing. Again, space could have been a problem (Compositor A had just set three lines of verse as two lines of prose), but a He rises could have been tucked in to the right on her verse line. More probably, no such direction existed in the manuscript copy, and taking the appropriate action was felt to be something a professional actor could manage on his own. Similarly, in 5.3 during the women's embassy to convince Coriolanus to spare Rome, where the dialogue indicates a kiss, a curtsy, a bow, and a good deal of kneeling and rising, the only SD is a single Kneeles . Had there been none, it would not have been surprising. Sporadic marking for such actions is consistent with the evidence that book-keepers were most concerned with entrances, unusual properties, and music and sound cues, not with minor or obvious stage business. Single action-directions and exits were as a rule added in the right margin (and reproduced there by the compositors); other marginal additions (often on the left for the annotator's) were meant to be incorporated into entry or exit directions, and these could present the compositors with more of a problem. A theatrically specific Exeunt appears on the dialogue-line at 3.1.228/1948, just above the two-line SD In this Mutinie, the Tribunes, the Ædiles, and the | People are beat in ; the intended position in the text for Exeunt was apparently not clear, and it was inaccurately set before instead of after the narrative version. In the descriptive entry direction at 1.9.0 a marginal Flourish seems to have lacked a clear indication for placement, and it was mistakenly set as the first word rather than after Alarum . A Retreat is sounded , where it should signal the victorious Romans' return to their camp after their enemies' retreat. Indeed, Alarum . A Retreat is sounded may have been meant as part of the missing exit direction for 1.8 (at the bottom of the second column on aa3 v ), omitted because Compositor B had run out of space on his page; or, if the sound cues were all marginal additions, their order might not have been clear, and Compositor B, or the printing- house editor who cast-off the copy, picked out Flourish to set as the catch- word. 90 The SD at 1.9.0 is at the top of Compositor A's first page, aa4, and he repeated the error. He seems to have soon found a kindred confusion in his portion of the manuscript: the first words of the entry direction for 1.10, A flourish . Cornets , should probably appear above, in the exit direction for 1.9, where the flourish would more appropriately accompany the departure of the victorious Romans than the subsequent entry of the wounded Aufidius and two or three Souldiors somewhere on the battlefield. 91 At 2.2.154/1377-78 it looks as though the first three words were a later marginal addition: Flourish Cornets. | Then Exeunt. Manet Sicinius and Brutus . The Exeunt which should follow Cornets is instead on the subsequent line and Then included in the SD. (It is possible that Then was meant to be part of the SD, like Here at 1.8.13/740, but since both kinds of temporally-oriented SDs tend to be eliminated in F plays set from earlier quartos, presumably as part of the printing house's modernisation of old-fashioned forms, the retention here suggests a compositor concentrating on the problem of incorporating a marginal annotation and so dutifully reproducing all his copy's words.) Some of these apparently misplaced sound directions give pause only to a reader, however; they would not have mattered for continuous playing within acts. While it is quite likely that Shakespeare himself would be concerned with the sound cues that would help create an effective atmosphere for this most martial of plays, some SDs point to the likelihood that a practical stage-manager has also gone over the manuscript, clarifying and specifying. 92 Although some Flourish directions stand alone, the SD A flourish . Cornets at 1.10.0 mentioned above suggests two marginal annotations, perhaps in different hands, where the initial cue for A flourish has been made more specific by indicating the appropriate instruments to produce it, perhaps with the Blackfriars Theatre in mind as a venue. 93 The same may be true of the earlier directions in the same column of aa4, at 1.9.66/822, Flourish . Trumpets sound, and Drums , and of the exit direction for Flourish . Cornets at 2.1.204/1120. (At 5.5.7/3648 specificity is worked more smoothly into the direction: A Flourish with Drummes &amp; Trumpets .) At 2.1.166/1069, the initial imperative in Sound . Flourish might have been added later to make this SD stand out from the surrounding text and as a result confused Compositor A into setting it off with an unusual number of spaces, as though Flourish were a separate direction. The single word Cornets at the head of the opening SD of Act 3 may well be another instance of a doubly specified marginal annotation (e.g. `Flourish' `Cornets' in the manuscript), here truncated by Compositor A's pressing need for space. There is no white space around the SDs on bb1 v , and the rules setting off Actus Tertius are only 8 mm. apart instead of the usual 16 mm. The entry direction is lengthy, and in order to preserve the favoured inverted-pyramid form for multi-line SDs, Compositor A may have omitted what he judged the less significant word in the sound cue. Other indications of a practically-minded annotator appear in directions which give redundant information in order to insure that significant speakers are named on entry. Both in the dialogue and in SHs such as Both , Both Tri ., and Tri ., Shakespeare sometimes appears to think of the tribunes collectively, important as tribunes of the people and as Coriolanus' civic antagonists but not otherwise distinguishable. It is quite likely that in entry directions Shakespeare went no further than listing the two Tribunes and that the `doubling' produced by adding both individual names at 2.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.6.0, and 5.1.0 is the playhouse annotator's contribution. 94 Annotation for performance was not as thorough as in a modern promptbook, but no entries are omitted. Twice Enter means `Come forward' (2.1.204/1122; 4.5.147/2808), but in the first instance Brutus and Sicinius have been directed to stand Aside earlier (2.1.96/992), and the second can be worked out from the dialogue. 95 Except for Titus Lartius in 1.4 and 3.1, omitted exits are clear from the context; they would have presented no problems to a professional company and might never have been added to the playbook. 96 At the end of 1.10 there is plenty of room for an Exeunt , but this is also the end of an act, and the scene shifts from Aufidius and two Volscians somewhere outside Corioles to, in 2.1, Rome. The last line of 2.2 also has room for Exeunt , but the tribunes' dialogue makes clear their departure. In 2.3, three different groups of citizens appear to judge Coriolanus' fitness for the consulship, but only one group is given an exit direction. Page aa6 v is very crowded, however (the one Exeunt at 2.3.84/1475 has to share a line with the entry direction for the next group of citizens), and Compositor B may have felt he could not at 2.3.111/1502 fit in an Exeunt that existed in his manuscript copy. The same may be true for the departure of the third group of citizens on the next page, bb1, for there is no room for Exeunt on the citizens' last speech-line. (Compositor A could have tucked in a numerically inaccurate Exit , had he been as bold as Compositor B, or dropped the citizens' exit down to Coriolanus' line `Worthy Voices', although then he would have had to have expanded to Exeunt Citizens .) A few more serious problems remain, ambiguities that might have required consultation by the players with the author. As mentioned above in the discussion of SHs, in 3.1 it is unclear when Titus Lartius, a fairly major character in the first act of the play, exits. Perhaps the theatrical annotator either did not catch the oversight or considered that Titus' accompanying the exiting Coriolanus and Cominius would be assumed; perhaps Titus' exit here (and in 1.4) were evident in this actor's own part but did not get recorded in the playbook of the whole text. Alternatively, Titus' name might have been accidentally omitted by the scribe. The page, bb2 v , is crowded and contains both mislineation to save space and the cramming of short speeches by two separate characters onto one line, but Compositor A has had to allow two lines for the marginal exit direction for Coriolanus and Cominius (both spelled out in full), and he could have squeezed in Titus had he noticed it in his copy. Another muddle over exits appears on page cc3, between two scenes set in the streets of Rome which since Dyce have been differentiated as 5.4 and 5.5; before his subdivision, they were considered one continuous scene. There is only one Exeunt here, at 5.4.62/3638; the subsequent entry direction is for two Senators, with Ladies, passing over | the Stage, with other Lords (5.5.0.1-2). Since it is clear that seven lines later a new scene must begin, when Aufidius and his attendants enter and the action shifts to Antium/Corioles (5.6), an exit direction is needed for the Roman procession . Although Dyce's division into two separate scenes (5.4 and 5.5) has been generally accepted, it may not reflect the original staging. It is quite possible that neither 5.4 nor 5.5 had exit directions in the original authorial manuscript and that the book-keeper, reading through fairly quickly to catch specific places that needed annotation, misplaced his Exeunt up (or, alternatively, that the author himself did the same thing). Possibly, the scribe added an exit direction he felt was needed, misled by the subsequent Enter direction and the fact that neither of the two following speeches (in present 5.5) is by, or obviously addressed to, the characters who were on stage for 5.4. It is thus possible that originally the characters on stage in 5.4 were not intended to exit but rather move to stage-side to meet the incoming procession of victorious ladies and help swell the crowd for the All shouts of welcome; editors before Dyce usually substituted Going for Exeunt at 5.4.62/3638. In such a continuous staging the undesignated Sena . speech `Behold our Patronnesse...' would be addressed to Menenius, Sicinius and the messengers, as well as to the theatre audience, `other Lords', and senator who entered with the ladies (rather than just to the latter); and it makes a good deal of sense for this public procession. In this reading, the Exeunt should come at the end of what is now marked 5.5, after its SD A Flourish with Drummes &amp; Trumpets . Still, the action is certainly playable as it stands in F, as two scenes the second of which (5.5) lacks a final Exeunt but where the need for a cleared stage is obvious from context. Two more significant confusions about exits, entrances, and general stage movement occur in 1.4 (on aa3) and 1.8 (aa3 v ). 97 Page aa3 is replete with indications that Compositor B, on only his second page of work on the play, was having trouble with his copy. Some of the problems may have been created by Shakespeare, the scribe, or the annotator; others were mechanical, imposed by having too much copy allotted for this page. White space around SDs in the first column begins to disappear and Titus' entry direction is crammed into the right margin; in the second column the one bit of white space (after 1.4.61/563) is misplaced in that it comes within a scene (perhaps mistaken for a new scene, since it is above an entry direction for Martius), while there is none before 1.5 or 1.6, each clearly a new scene. Turnovers and mislineation to gain space indicate that in the second column Compositor B was desperate to crowd in his allotted amount of copy. The ambiguities we are concerned with first, however, appear in the first column and may not be Compositor B's fault. Descriptive, `literary' SDs in Coriolanus , while apparently sometimes annotated, have not here been sufficiently clarified for a twentieth-century reading audience, although they are unlikely to have proved insuperably challenging to Shakespeare's own company. At 1.4.29/523-24, a two-line SD demands Alarum, the Romans are beat back to their Trenches | Enter Martius Cursing . The first line is sufficiently like narrative directions at 1.4.62/568 and 4.5.49/2703 signaling exits (see above discussion) that, taken in conjunction with the second line's entry direction and a new SH Mar ., even though he was the last speaker before the fighting, the editors of the Oxford Complete Works were led to assume a cleared stage and a new scene beginning with Martius' (re-)entry. J. W. Saunders, however, suggests a staging in which 'the extreme edge of the platform, that is to say, the stage-rails and yard alleys', represents the trenches, and Martius remains visible while driving off the Volscians; Enter Martius Cursing would then mean `Come forward' (as it does elsewhere in the play) in order to berate the soldiers who fled the battle. 98 Titus' exit and the general stage movement might have been worked out by the King's Men on their own, as it has been for modern productions, or in consultation with the author. The next SD, at 1.4.42/538-39, is an omnibus description that details the action here and for the next four lines: Another Alarum, and Martius followes them to | gates, and is shut in . It is partially repeated at 1.4.45/543 (where Enter the Gati is presumably a compositorial mis-setting for Gates ), either by Shakespeare adding details to his own manuscript to specify the point at which action is to be taken, or by a theatrical annotator. 99 Whether the marginal Enter Titus Lartius at 1.4.47/547 is the author's late correction of a missed re-entry, the annotator's, or Compositor B's, it seems an afterthought, since even when pressed for space, both compositors try to place entries on a separate line. If compositorial, B may have realized, after the fact, that he had omitted a perfectly clear entry direction and so crammed it into the right margin of his column under Alarum continues or, already feeling this page's space constraints, purposefully chose to save a line by demoting Titus' entry to its marginal placement in F, where it shares a line with a few words of dialogue by All . If this were the case, the original entry direction for Titus might have contained more information, words clarifying Titus' movements in the preceding moments, that Compositor B had no room to include. Space-saving imperatives may have influenced SDs in other ways that can affect our view of the degree to which the manuscript copy for Coriolanus was in its final form. The most obvious instances occur in two short scenes, 1.7 and 1.8. Both appear in the second column of aa3 v , Compositor B's first page, and seem to be the result of ambiguously placed marginal annotation combined with compositorial desperation about fitting copy to page. Both compositors' preference for the inverted-pyramid form for long entry directions is violated in the setting of the SD at 1.7.0.1-4, a multi-line `authorial' direction that, pyramidally centred, might have taken up an additional line: Titus Lartius, having set a guard upon Carioles, going with | Drum and Trumpet toward Cominius, and Caius Mar- | tius, Enters with a Lieutenant, other Souldiours, and a | Scout . Instead, it starts flush left and continues flush right with a minor left-indentation for lines 2-4. 100 The last part of the SD ( Enters . . . Scout ) suggests that he was having some trouble adjusting a marginal note specifying those accompanying Titus. Compositor B seems to be patching the added specified characters into a direction he now realizes lacks an initial Enter . Given the capital E , possibly there were two marginal annotations, an Enter meant to head the direction and a list of characters that got amalgamated with it. 101 The subsequent Exit instead of the longer, but correct, Exeunt at 1.7.7/721 is governed by the necessity to fit it onto the same line as the scenes's last line of dialogue. In his handling of 1.8, it would seem that Compositor B took up the challenge of bending his copy to his own immediate practical needs. Hard-pressed for space at the very end of the second column of his page, he combines two short verse lines (1.8.6-7/731) and then amalgamates the medial action direction and the concluding exit direction, not bothering to excise the now old-fashioned here (though to have done so would have saved space): Heere they fight, and certaine Volces come in ayde | of Auffi.Martius fights til they be driven in breathles . The pressure under which B operated is suggested by the uncharacteristic name abbreviation, lack of spacing between names, and the uncharacteristic spelling breathles (instead of breathlesse ). If there was an Exeunt in his copy, Compositor B had room for it on the same line as the last words of dialogue, but there may well not have been such an imperative, if we assume that driven in breathles was deemed sufficient by both Shakespeare and the theatrical annotator. Here Compositor B's solution has turned a scene that made perfectly good dramatic sense into one in which Aufidius is left awkwardly alone on stage to berate the would-be rescuers who have already exited fighting with Martius. 102 In smaller matters, too, the effects of incorrectly cast-off copy have forced abandonment of typographical convention, and compositorial compensation here supports the case for more important omissions or misplacements. Exeunt with a lower-case e at 1.5.3/572 (on aa3) and 4.7.57/3148 (on cc1) both manage to cram in the necessary directorial information at the cost of relinquishing the conventional capital, which takes up more space. Folio plays set from printed quarto copy suggest that Jaggard's house style preferred the full form of proper names in SDs, yet on crowded pages SDs with abbreviated names appear, not just at 1.8.13/741 but at 2.3.150/1547 (bb1) and 3.1.222/1939 (bb2 v ). At 4.6.148/3076 (bb6 v ), Exeunt both may be a Shakespearean direction left unexpanded by the annotator, or it may be Compositor B's solution to the impossibility, on a page with no room for a separate-line exit direction, of setting Exeunt Cominius and Menenius . Elsewhere exit and entry directions on the same line at TLN 1475 (aa6 v ), or entry directions tucked into the same line as dialogue (such as Enter Titus Latius , on aa3, mentioned above; Enter Cominius at TLN 2195 on bb3 v ; Enter second Servant at TLN 2665 on bb5), as well as short speeches by different speakers set on the same line, all bear witness to economising on pages with little or no white space and showing other signs of crowding. 103 While these space-saving stratagems do not affect more than F's attempts at standardised presentation of the copy text, there are other instances where the need for economy enforced by inaccurate casting-off may have affected the transmission more substantively. At 2.3.60/1451 (aa6 v ) Menenius exits, but a number of editors have felt that Coriolanus' next one and one- half lines are still addressed to Menenius and have moved the exit down accordingly. While I do not think the F SD is certainly misplaced, the case can be made that the page is crowded, space-saving measures have been taken elsewhere in the second column, and there was no room to set Exit Menenius at 2.3.61/1454, where these editors think it belongs; it was possible, however, to add a simple Exit at the end of Menenius' final speech at 2.3.60/1451. At 1.5.3/572 (on aa3) the space-saving exeunt for the looting Roman soldiers, which even with its lower-case e fills the space remaining in the third soldier's last line, may be a compositorial compression of a longer SD (such as Souldiers steele away , similar to the SD at 1.1.251/279 for the citizens). The subsequent dialogue appears to require that their departure with their spoils be visible to the entering Martius and Titus, since Martius immediately comments on the soldiers' greed and precipitate desertion of duty. This suspicion is strengthened by the fact that six lines later (in a speech of long verse lines and no appreciable free space in the right margin) a music cue seems to have been omitted. 104 It is true that Martius and Titus Lartius had entered to the sound of Alarum continues still a-farre off , yet Coriolanus has been thoroughly annotated for off-stage noises, and nowhere else does a `harke' (1.5.9/580) fail to have its immediately corresponding Alarum or Showts either in the right margin or on a line of its own. It has been established that in F plays set from printed quarto copy Compositor B was not above altering or leaving out what he felt he had no room to set, and one suspects another Alarum stood in the manuscript copy here. 105 Not having to do with SDs but pertinent here is the dropped line after 2.3.243/1645 (on bb1 v ), which may be the result of normal scribal or compositorial eye- skip; if compositorial, Compositor A's inattentiveness here may have been influenced by the pressing necessity to conserve space, since a few lines later he sets very narrow rules around Actus Tertius . 106 More problematic than the moved direction for a battle-exit in 1.8, though of significant production impact, is the possibility that inaccurately cast-off copy for cc2 v may have forced Compositor B to push up one of Shakespeare's most theatrically powerful advisory directions. At the point of greatest tension in Act 5, the conclusion of Volumnia's peroration on behalf of Rome at 5.3.183/3539, F calls for a brief tableau: Holds her by the hand silent . E. A. J. Honigmann has argued for the SD's correct placement one line below its F occurrence (that is, after `O Mother, Mother!'). He urges that in pragmatic theatrical terms it would make easier the actor's `difficult task of conveying an overwhelming emotion without the help of words' if he could begin to express his feelings and then break off. He further points out that the SD's form violates the convention observed elsewhere in Coriolanus , and normally in other texts, that at the end of a speech `a direction lacking a subject refers to the previous speaker, not the next one'. 107 Since the SD in F occupies its own line, there is plenty of room for it to be headed Coriolanus ; Honigmann suggests that the manuscript's marginal direction was not properly aligned with the text, and this may indeed have been the case. An ambiguously placed SD might have encouraged Compositor B to place it here rather than breaking up Coriolanus' speech after only one half-line of verse, especially since he seems not to have liked intrusive SDs in mid-speech. 108 The kind of argument I have been pursuing here would at least support the contention that the SD was a marginal annotation, one whose length posed the challenge of creating enough space to set it on a separate line. There is no white space around SDs on this page, though Menenius' and Sicinius' entry for the new scene at 5.4 would under normal circumstances have been set off with blank lines (at the very least, one above it); Compositor B may have feared that even so he would run out of room for the half-column of prose coming up. At any rate, from the top of the second column through the first line of 5.4 (a turn-over), B tries to conserve space any way he can. Even with an ampersand and short spellings, TLN 3538 runs all the way to the margin; by also omitting the final mark of punctuation, Compositor B manages to cram one and one-half lines of verse into this one line of type. 109 If Honigmann is correct about the SD having been a marginal annotation, B has now created a whole free line on which to set the direction Honigmann thinks was meant to accompany TLN 3540 but for which there was no room. Yet this line of reasoning is not wholly persuasive, for it assumes a Compositor B concerned with very immediate problems but unable to look even one line ahead to the true solution: having managed to provide a spare line for the SD, Coriolanus' completion of Volumnia's half-line could have been set immediately after TLN 3538 and the direction set beneath it. Elsewhere in Coriolanus Compositor B was willing to interrupt a speech for a necessary cue that would not fit into the margin, if he could spare the extra line: in 1.4 (in the first column on aa3) the First Senator's speech to the Romans is disrupted by the Alarum farre off to which he refers. 110 Alternatively, if B (mis-) believed that the placement within the text should be where he put it, then, according to Honigmann, B's knowledge of house style ought to have led him to head the SD He or Coriolanus . Yet elsewhere in F Compositor B set a SD for one character within the `speech boundaries' of another: in F Hamlet the Sleepes SD for the Player King appears in the right margin of the Player Queen's first line (TLN 2095), even though there was room on the Player King's last line to set it there. Perhaps the marginal SD for Coriolanus was clearly cued to its F position but was also thought by author and annotator to be unmistakably marked as his action-direction by the very nature of its wording. Nor do modern actors seem to have a problem with the F placement; the long silence before revealing any articulate response to Volumnia builds a fine dramatic tension. Despite Compositor B's preference (itself apparently rather weak) and the lack of He or Coriolanus heading the SD, the case for repositioning it remains inconclusive. As with the imputed problem of `I. Cit .' or `2. Cit .' in 1.1, this seems to be a case in which F is not certainly wrong and so should not be emended. Some errors of mistaken content rather than placement may also be compositorial. We have already noted Compositor B's misunderstanding on bb4 of the scribe's or book-keeper's perhaps poorly-spaced Latin tag as a proper name and his appending it to Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, with Cumalijs . Another such misreading, appearing in the dialogue at 1.3.43/405, might be compositorial: what most modern editors print as `At Grecian sword contemning. Tell Valeria' is in F `At Grecian sword. Contenning , tell Valeria '. More likely, the misunderstanding of a partially illegible word and consequent re-punctuation — or, if Hand D is any indication, the lack of a full stop after `contemning', probable lack of all the minims for the word itself, and likelihood of a capital C — was the scribe's, merely reproduced by Compositor B. Trying to make sense of it, either could have misplaced the italic from Grecian to Contenning . Even had the error stood in the manuscript playbook, however, the result is an odd name for the Waiting Gentlewoman, but not unintelligible dialogue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV There are no major bars to the manuscript copy for F Coriolanus having served as playbook for the King's Men. While there are a few inaccurate SDs, in content or slight misplacement, a number of absent exit directions, and many fewer SDs describing stage business than the dialogue suggests should take place, these features are all common in the surviving manuscript promptbooks and also occur in printed quartos thought to have been set from prompt copy or to have been annotated from it. Indeed, some were probably created by later misreading of the intended placement for marginal additions; others, including the missing sound cue on aa3 and the repositioned exit direction on aa3 v , by compositorial attempts to solve the problem of lack of space created by cast-off copy. While a few SH errors seem to derive from misunderstanding ambiguous abbreviations for `Coriolanus' and `Cominius', by and large SHs are fairly regular and not misleading; compositorial shortening of what may have been longer manuscript forms has not changed this fact. Although modern editors alter a number of them, believing certain speeches to have been misassigned, in many cases there is dispute about which need altering, and the retention of F by one or another editor supports the actability of F as it stands. Where it is not, the fault can be seen as at least plausibly having been introduced later, by scribe or compositor or both, or, as on bb2 v for instance, as the result of physical damage to the manuscript suffered sometime in the interim between production and publication. And we must also at least entertain the possibility that some ambiguities were straightened out in the actors' parts and the `plot' but not recorded in the playbook itself. The original manuscript was annotated with performance in mind, almost certainly twice and possibly three times: first by the author as he went over his work adding SHs, sharpening SDs, and perhaps adding minor revisions; again by the book-keeper; and, if the first performance was at the Globe, again for a later Blackfriars performance. (It may also have received further attention in the printing house to bring it into conformity with the F format.) The scribe had his own problems with, and consequent misreadings of, that manuscript, though on the whole he seems faithfully to have reproduced what he thought he saw before him, including at least one possibly Shakespearean spelling in the unfamiliar name Scicinius and perhaps others. He did sophisticate in lesser matters of spelling, punctuation, the Latinisation to Omnes in at least some SHs for All and, possibly, in Cum alijs (though this may be the book-keeper's contribution). Further alterations in spelling and punctuation, as well as further misreadings, would have been contributed by Compositors A and B. Much of the serious mispunctuation in F Coriolanus , which can sometimes render a passage nearly unintelligible, was probably introduced by the scribe, trying to make sense of a very lightly pointed Shakespearean original while imposing his own more modern and sophisticated system of punctuation. That the compositors added their own is likely; they certainly increased the degree of mislineation. This scenario seems to me the most likely one, although the point at which the scribe entered the chain of transmission of F Coriolanus is beyond any certain determination. If early, he prepared the fair copy subsequently annotated by the book-keeper. SH errors, much of the mispunctuation, and many misreadings would have entered the text at this stage, while misplacement of ambiguously cued marginal annotation would be the later contribution of Compositors A and B. If later, then most of the SD errors were the scribe's (though he may have introduced some new ambiguities himself); the compositors would inevitably have added erroneous readings of their own, but probably tampered with his SD placement only when they could not accommodate it to their page. Since some of the irregularities that would appear to disqualify Coriolanus as theatrical playbook seem to be scribal in origin, and since the text as we have it (especially when we conjecture what it looked like before obvious compositorial intervention) seems to have been by seventeenth- century standards adequately annotated for performance, a late transcription would appear most likely. Late transcription would mean that the playbook used for performance was substantially freer of error than the F text. That the author's papers were transcribed twice, first in 1608 to be given to the book-keeper to annotate and then later in preparation for F, is possible but not, to me, probable. To the reasons given above, we might add the unlikelihood of Shakespearean idiosyncracies, like spellings, surviving yet another copyist. It would make sense, then, that although the King's Men had performed Coriolanus from an annotated Shakespearean fair copy, they would not want to give up their one, perhaps by now quite untidy, exemplar to the printers. A professional, sophisticated- looking transcript would also have been desirable for Coriolanus ' intended prominence as first play in the Tragedies section of the First Folio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* Much of the research for this essay was completed while on a Folger-NEH fellowship at the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C., while the author was working on an edition of Coriolanus for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. 1 The Riverside Shakespeare , gen. ed. G. Blakemore Evans (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1974), p. 1437a. In 1985, in The Craft of Printing and the Publication of Shakespeare's Works (Washington D.C.: Folger, 1985), George Walton Williams still found the scholarly consensus to be Shakespeare's own `fair copy' of his `foul' or working papers (p. 84), and in `Today We Have Parting of Names: A Preliminary Inquiry into Some Speech-(Be)Headings in Coriolanus ', Thomas Clayton agrees about Shakespearean holograph, but thinks the manuscript might have been used as a promptbook (MS copy, courtesy of the author, p. 24; forthcoming in Shakespeare's Speech-Headings and the Bibliographer, the Editor, and the Critic , ed.

Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, Coriolanus appears in the summary chart of copy texts on p. 147. John Jowett's later discussion of the nature of the copy is more certain of a promptbook original, although the F compositors' copy may have come to them at one remove: `The inaccuracies in speech-prefixes might alternatively indicate that the copy for F was not the prompt-book itself but a transcript of it — in which case the prompt-book may or may not have been based on authorial fair copy' (p. 594). 5 R. B. Parker, ed., Oxford Shakespeare Coriolanus (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1994), p. 143. Parker thinks that the author's fair copy probably became the company's playbook and that the F copytext manuscript was probably the `penultimate draft in which he was still to some extent "thinking through" the play' (p. 147). 6 Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), 2: 506. In `Line Division in Shakespeare's Dramatic Verse: An Editorial Problem', Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography 8 (1984), Paul Werstine emends Hinman by noting that since four formes of Coriolanus were set before the first of Titus was composed, `it was not strictly necessary that copy for the whole of Cor . be cast off until after the last of these formes (2 v :5) was in type. Perhaps then three pages of Cor . were not set from cast-off copy (aa4, 4 v , 5 v )' (p. 117 n. 30). 7 Hinman, Printing and Proofreading of the First Folio , 2: 163-64. Hinman's temporal calculation is based on the fact that `between cc3:4 v and the postulated cancels in groups 7 and 8 come two full quires of the regular series and five intercalary formes'. 8 The suggestion, first made by Harley Granville-Barker, Prefaces to Shakespeare , 2 vols. (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1947), 2: 294, was developed by John Dover Wilson in his New Shakespeare edition of Coriolanus (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960): the elaborate SDs for this play, as for The Tempest , were `perhaps necessitated ... by the author's absence in Stratford at the time the play was being rehearsed' (p. 131); see also Martin R. Holmes, Shakespeare and Burbage (Chichester, Sussex: Phillmore &amp; Co., 1978), p. 196. 9 In the New Variorum Shakespeare Antony and Cleopatra (MLA, 1990), Marvin Spevack questions a number of Wilson's list of characteristic Shakespearean spellings (New Shakespeare Coriolanus , pp. 133-34), but he offers support for the unusual use of sc for initial s , unmentioned by Wilson, in Scicinius for Sicinius (p. 374). Brockbank, in his Arden edition of Coriolanus (pp. 3-4), does discuss this example, and he adds several others `which may indicate Shakespearean idiosyncrasies'—such as shoot for shout , strooke for struck , god for good , too for to , especially in the form too't ; see also Parker's Oxford Sha kespeare edition, pp. 138-39. 10 On the pages of Addition II of More , see Shakespeare's Hand in `The Play of Sir Thomas More' , ed. A. W. Pollard and J. Dover Wilson (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1923); for the other instances of sc for s , see the Oxford Textual Companion , p. 593, and Spevack, New Variorum Antony and Cleopatra , p. 374. 11 Alice Walker's conclusion in `The Folio Text of 1 Henry IV ', SB 6 (1954) that Compositor B exhibited `habitual carelessness' and `was unusually prone to take liberties with his copy' (p. 55) has, on a more extensive survey of B's Folio work, been corrected by Paul Werstine in `Compositor B of the Shakespeare First Folio', Analytical and Enumerative Bibliography 2 (1978), 241-63, and `Line Division', cited in n. 6. 12 In his editior's preface to the most recent book of essays on the More manuscript, Shakespeare and 'Sir Thomas More': Essays on the play and its Shakespearean interest (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989), T. H. Howard-Hill notes that his contributors at the very least agree that the case for Shakespeare as author of Addition II is as strong as any so far made to deny it or identify another playwright as Hand D (p. 2). Howard-Hill himself concludes that together the essays tip 'the balance further in favour of Shakespeare as the author and hand' of Addition II (p. 8). 13 In 'Spelling and the Bibliographer', The Library , fifth ser. 18 (1963), T. H. Hill concludes that it 'has not yet been settled whether a preference for one form of spelling predisposes an author or copyist towards another morphologically similar spelling' (p. 11). His own study of Ralph Crane shows that Crane, at least, was not so predisposed. 14 The probabiliity that an idiosyncratic spelling would be perpetuated through the labours of two regularising copyists is lower than for one, of course (Q Justice Scilens does not survive in F 2 Henry IV ); but the fact that Scicinius is an uncommon Roman name, rather than a common English noun for which a copyist often had his own preferred spelling, might increase its chances of being carefully reproduced by both scribe and Compositor A. It should be noted, however, that A. C. Partridge cautions against depending on the initial sc as being spectacularly rare; in Orthography in Shakespeare and Elizabethan Drama (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1964), he cites other contemporary examples (p. 62), and I have found additional ones, including settings in John Marston's Sophonisba (Q 1606) of Scyphax for Syphax , scilent for silent , and scilence for silence (twice). 15 Shoot appears on both Wilson's and Brockbank's lists (see n. 9); arrant is suggested by David Bevington in his New Cambridge Shakespeare edition of Antony and Cleopatra (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990), p. 261. 16 Act, scene, and line numbers are cited from The Riverside Shakespeare (see n. 1) and, following the slash, TLN (Through-Line-Numbers) keyed to Charlton Hinman's Norton Facsimile of The First Folio of Shakespeare (New York: W.W. Norton, 1968). These will sometimes appear not to match, where the modern edition has relineated the F line(s). Because they are often pertinent to my argument, the F spelling (with only u / v and long s normalised) and line breaks have been retained. F's terminal periods for SDs and unabbreviated SHs have been omitted as too distracting to appear repeatedly in mid-sentence. When medial or terminal punctuation, or its absence, is significant, it will be noted in the discussion. 17 In The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romanes , transl. Thomas North (London, 1595): `So the Coriolans ... made a salye out upon them, in the which at the first the Coriolans had the better, and drave the Romaines backe againe into the trenches of their campe' (p. 238); later, Coriolanus `disguised himselfe in such array and attire, as he thought no man could ever have knowen him for the person he was, seeing him in that apparell he had upon his backe ... his face all muffled over' (p. 247). 18 See the Oxford Textual Companion introduction to All is True , p. 618, for a more detailed discussion of evidence for Shakespeare's apparent preference for has , and for the fact that the only other plays in which Compositor B, at least haphazardly following his copy, set a high proportion of ha's are Macbeth and F Hamlet , both generally agreed to have been set from scribal copy; for do's and does , see the Textual Companion introduction to F Lear , pp. 530-31. Less certain as indication of a scribal intermediary is Coriolanus ' pattern of 40 Oh against 12 O , although O `predominates over Oh in nearly all the good quartos of Shakespeare's plays', according to MacD. P. Jackson, Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare (Salzburg, 1979), p. 215; see also Gary Taylor and John Jowett, Shakespeare Reshaped, 1606-1623 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), Appendix II. 19 This and the preceding examples and figures are taken from the Oxford Textual Companion , p. 593, although I have corrected the number of a'th from the Textual Companion 's inaccurate 29; the figures given include variant spellings that lack the final mark of elision, a'th and o'th . (The fact that in both All's Well and Coriolanus most a'th' were set by Compositor B suggests that he was more tolerant of this form, less prone to regularise to o'th' , than Compositor A, who in Coriolanus set only 1 a'th' to 6 o'th' ). On a'th' and o'th' , John Jowett, the Oxford editor of Coriolanus , finds that `to some extent' these two forms are found in `clusters', and that `in particular the copy for 4.5.21-4.6.131/2285-2631 might have been in a second hand' (p. 593). Inspection of the passage in question, however, does not seem to substantiate this last point. 20 For instance, o'th' is common in both Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra ; Coriolanus ' 27 instances of a'th' , however, distinguish it from Ant ., which has only 1. In `The Use of Linguistic Criteria in Determining the Copy and Date for Shakespeare's Plays', Pacific Coast Studies in Shakespeare , ed. Waldo F. McNeir and Thelma Greenfield (Eugene: Univ. of Oregon Books, 1966), Frederick O. Waller finds that from about Twelfth Night on, there is a clear pattern of Shakespeare's `moving toward more informal, colloquial usages', with an increasing use of has and does , alongside the early forms hath and doth , and of the contracted forms of the (p. 7). However, the figures for Coriolanus , and the number with added apostrophes, are still anomalously high. 21 Brockbank suggests as a Shakespearean preference too for to , though he connects it with the form too't (see n. 9). 22 In his note to Hamlet 1.5.35 ( Textual Companion , p. 404), Gary Taylor observes that the `Shakespeare canon contains 1,526 occurrences of tis to only 35 it's '. Only 3 it's appear in good quartos; most occur in plays generally agreed to have been set from scribal copy, and `another 7 occur in Folio texts of doubtful copy', Coriolanus (4) and Antony and Cleopatra (3). I think Coriolanus was set from a scribal transcript, and this is probably the case for Ant . as well. 23 It is of course possible that both instances result from the wrong type being in the compositor's `I' box, or from Compositor B's mistake as he repeated the word to himself to hold it in mind while he set his composing stick. In his Oxford Shakespeare edition of Coriolanus , Parker disagrees: he finds that Hand D's capital I `resembled an A or arabic 4' and was responsible for these errors (p. 139). Inspection of the plates in Sir Edward Maunde Thomspon's Shakespeare's Handwriting and Pollard and Wilson's Shakespeare's Hand in `The Play of Sir Thomas More' indicates that Hand D's I could be mistaken for 4 but not for A . 24 Partridge, Orthography , p. 58. Regardless of the identity of Hand D, Shakespeare's own punctuation was likely to have been light. In 'The Noisy Comma', Antony Hammond notes that most dramatic manuscripts 'before about 1620 are very sparsely punctuated, and what punctuation there is ... is based upon conventions different from those which the printers were in the process of establishing' ( Crisis in Editing: Texts of the English Renaissance , ed. Randall McLeod [New York: AMS Press, 1994], p. 214). 25 Absence of final punctuation and Shakespeare's tendency to write initial c as a capital apparently created the new sentence at 4.1.5/2441 (bb4 v ), although the break violates the original sentence's sense: `You were us'd | To say, Extreamities was the trier of spirits, | That common chances. Common men could bear,...'. It perhaps accounts for the random capitalisation in mid-sentence elsewhere of verbal forms beginning with c . Another whole passage of mispointed verse comes at 3.3.67-71/2348-52 (bb4). 26 Jaggard's house style for F was to use an apostrophe to indicate an unvoiced ending to the past participle in verse, e.g. `answer'd'; instances of elision indicated by spelling alone in Hand D are `lyvd' (= lived) and `sylenct'. Initial elision in the More pages can be seen in `thippe' (= th'hip) and `thoffendor'. 27 Partridge, Orthography , pp. 102-03. For evidence from Jaggard's 1599 printing of Shakespeare's sonnet 144 in the quarto of The Passionate Pilgrim , see pp. 133-34. 28 In `Author, Compositor, and Meter: Copy-Spellings in Titus Andronicus ', Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 53 (1959), Hereward T. Price thinks it clear that Shakespeare `closely adapted spelling to meter, showing elision, where that was necessary, or printing the full form, just as the meter demanded' (p. 160). In his study of Spenser, Massinger, and Harrington, he finds that in most cases, when setting verse, the compositor would follow his copy (p. 185). If this is true, then the scribe would be the one to have expanded most of the elisions. Yet we cannot be certain that Shakespeare was consistent, at least for medial elision, or that there were as many instances as I have supposed. It is also possible that compositors had certain preferences of their own or for some words set colloquial pronunciation, since marv'llous (2682) occurs in a short line of prose. 29 In `Folio Compositors and Folio Copy: King Lear and Its Context', Papers of the Bibliographic Society of America 79 (1985), Gary Taylor finds that Compositor B would add anomalous apostrophes where the sense does not require them, so some beyond those imposed by the scribe might have crept in in the printing house (pp. 35, 49). An instance in Coriolanus appears at 4.1.37/2476: start's . 30 Ibid ., p. 65. 31 Taylor and Jowett, Shakespeare Reshaped , Appendix I, p. 246. 32 Ibid . 33 For tables showing the proportion of exclamation marks taken from printed copy to those added by Compositor B, see Taylor, `Folio Compositors and Folio Copy', p. 66. 34 Werstine, `Line Division in Shakespeare's Dramatic Verse', p. 76. As will be apparent, my discussion of the lineation problems in Coriolanus is deeply indebted to this essay. On the mislineation in Hand D, see also the Oxford Textual Companion , p. 637. 35 Werstine, `Line Division', p. 97. Werstine's general assertions about Compositors A and B are based on his study of those F plays set from earlier printed copy and of the F plays set by these two compositors. See also Brockbank's discussion in his Arden ed., pp. 12-16. 36 Werstine, `Line Division', p. 104. 37 Ibid ., p. 96. Werstine notes that only 12 of A's 15 combined verses and 19 of B's 29 occur on pages where they were `demonstrably short of space' (p. 95), and also that if the compositors' copy contained combined verses,`we should expect to find repeatedly in the printed text not only two lines of verse set on a single line of type, but also two lines of verse set as two lines of prose, as we do in both Antony and Coriolanus ' (p. 121 n.40). 38 Ibid ., p. 97. Of Compositor B, Werstine notes that the example of Antony `indicates that he reproduced irregularities [in line division] in his copy when he found them' (p. 101). 39 The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romanes , p. 238. The 1595 edition corresponds in spelling with Shakespeare's text in conduites (compare Coriolanus, 2.3.242/1645), as well as in providing both the family names for Titus. For futher arguments on this edition as Shakespeare's source, see Brockbank's Arden edition, pp. 27-29. 40 The play's variant spellings of Corioles — Carioles (5 instances), Coriolus (1), Corialus (2) — may derive from misreadings by scribe or compositor ( Carioles appears in Compositor A's work as well as B's, although the latter two variants are set only by B); but all, or some, may originate in a Shakespearean casualness in reproducing North's Plutarch's Corioles . If the scribe and/or Compositor A were as careful here as with reproducing Scicinius , then at least Carioles as well as Corioles stood in the original manuscript text, or were misread as standing there. 41 In The Stability of Shakespeare's Text (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1965), E. A. J. Honigmann offers a theory of `irregular composition' that would explain the Lartius / Latius variations differently. In his view, Shakespeare did not begin composition with 1.1 but rather wrote 2.1.161ff., 3.1, and perhaps parts of 1.1 `before spotting the misprint in his Plutarch'; the argument is clinched for Honigmann by Shakespeare's highly unusual repetition of an identifying `label' — repetition but `not in its original form' — for Cominius in the SD at 2.1.161/1060 ( Cominius the Generall ) and at 2.2.36/1241 ( Cominius the Consul ), the latter a scene not, in Honigmann's view, written consecutively after 2.1 (p. 147). I do not find this argument convincing, in part because, as I have indicated, there are other possible explanations for the Lartius / Latius variations, and in part because the Cominius labels can be seen as consistent with continuous composition, since they designate distinct functions for this character in the two scenes: returning triumphant military general who then, in 2.2, reverts to his peacetime office of consul. The labels may also be meant to indicate costume changes. 42 Capell first added with others to the exit direction for Coriolanus and Cominius at 3.1.252/1980. The only Coriolanus supporters who have speaking parts after this exit are Menenius, one or two patricians (two Patri . SHs), and one or two senators (I Sen ., Sena .). In his Oxford Shakespeare edition, however, Parker has Titus exit earlier, at 3.1.20/1698. 43 Evidence from Hand D's scene in Sir Thomas More is perhaps most easily studied in Thomas Clayton's transcription in The `Shakespearean' Addition in `The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore': Some Aids to Scholarly and Critical Shakespearean Studies , Center for Shakespeare Studies Monograph No. 1 (Dubuque: Wm. C. Brown, 1969); see also the Oxford Textual Companion , pp. 461-67. In `Today We Have Parting of Names', Clayton suggests that the kind of `decremental abbreviations' found in the More manuscript may lie behind some SH mistakes in Coriolanus (p. 13). 44 What we cannot tell is whether the Latius spelling represents Shakespeare's original or a later misreading of a hastily written Lartius whose minim strokes fell short of the full complement for r and were glossed over for an immediate t . 45 Indeed, the first instance on aa4 is Titus Lartius , even though only this character's first name had been given in the immediately preceding SD, Enter Titus with his Power, from the Pursuit . Either Compositor A reproduced an unusually full copy form, or he dropped Lartius from the SD to make it centre more attractively on the page and then added it to the SH, since he was only setting a part line there and had plenty of room for it. It should be noted that he set one Mar . SH on this page, but he was forced into this expedient because the verse line at 1.9.41/797 is a long one. 46 Compositor A's preferred spellings, established by comparing his relevant F work with its printed quarto copy, are part of the evidence detailed by Gary Taylor in `The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio', SB 34 (1981), 96-117. 47 Other marks of non-authorial copy suggested by Compositor A's first page are 1 ha's , 1 do's , 2 Oh , and perhaps the round brackets. Compositor A generally resists the do's spelling, and this is his only instance in Coriolanus ; elsewhere he sets 2 does and 3 doth . 48 See above and n. 7. 49 Clayton, `Today We Have Parting of Names', pp. 12-14, 24. The sequence in question reads: Coriol ., Coriol ., Corio ., Com . (mis-set for Cor .?), Cor ., Cor ., Cor . 50 If we consider the whole page, 4 brackets, 6 Oh , 3 ha's ; if we consider only the second column, where the Coriol .- Cor . series appears, 2 pair of brackets, 4 Oh . 51 There are also two occurrences in Q1 Pericles (1609), but this is a corrupt text and not thought to have been set from Shakespearean autograph. 52 Facing a similar anomaly with the 6 Omnes (though only 8 All , all set by B) in Ant ., Marvin Spevack sees the probable implication to be that `the first instance of Omnes ,...set by Compositor E, was the copy's form. The other instances, set by B, are typical of his vacillation between what may be copy and the more economical All ' (New Variorum Antony and Cleopatra , p. 368). 53 Possibly with (or w th ) o , where the o had been smudged out of existence. In `A Prompt Copy of A Looking Glass for London and England ', MP 30 (1932-33), Charles Reed Baskervill notes inconsistencies in the book- keeper's correction of SHs in this black-letter quarto that has been marked up for a prompt: in some cases the printed copy's mistake is heavily scored through, in others only lightly, and in 5 instances the `incorrect printed SH has been allowed to stand along with the MS entry', written to its left (p. 38). The same casualness might affect annotated SDs. 54 In his Arden edition of Hamlet (London: Methuen, 1982), Harold Jenkins includes among what he takes to be the book-keeper's annotations to Q2's foul-paper copy the duplicate sound cues and Cum Alijs (p. 42); in a footnote he suggests that this book- keeper was the same man who prepared the fair copy behind F Hamlet . 55 W. W. Greg, in The Shakespeare First Folio (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), thought that because Coriolanus was intended to head the `Tragedies', act division was introduced at the time of printing as a mark of sophistication (p. 407). T. W. Baldwin thinks that, had this been the case, `one would have expected full dress of acts and scenes, not acts merely'; he suggests the `probability, not certainty, is that Coriolanus , Titus , and Caesar had recently been in production, so that availability may have been a weighty reason for using stage copies for them' ( On Act and Scene Division in the Shakespeare First Folio [Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1965], p. 105). 56 Wilfred T. Jewkes, Act Division in Elizabethan and Jacobean Plays, 1583- 1616 (Hamden, Conn.: Shoestring Press, 1958), pp. 96-101. Jewkes thinks act division in Coriolanus was probably not entered at the time of composition; to him it seems more likely that it was introduced at the same time as the additional SDs, and both `in connection with performance' (pp. 188-89). 57 Taylor, `The Structure of Performance', Shakespeare Reshaped , pp. 18, 30-31. J. Dover Wilson had suggested this adoption of act intervals in `Act and Scene Division in the Plays of Shakespeare', RES , 3 (1927), p. 394; see also Jewkes, Act Division in Elizabethan and Jacobean Plays , pp. 91-92, and Richard Hosley, `The playhouses and the stage', in Kenneth Muir and S. Schoenbaum, eds., A New Companion to Shakespeare Studies (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1971), p. 33. 58 Taylor has proposed a similar reading in `The Structure of Performance', p. 40. In his Oxford Shakespeare edition, however, Parker argues that the F division between Acts 3 and 4 `seems a mistake' and is perhaps therefore unShakespearean; yet since in his designation of three main movements in the play's action the first also overlaps an act division (between 1 and 2), he concludes that `the asymmetry may be intentional' and leaves unaltered F's notation of Acts 3 and 4 in his own text (p. 28). 59 Paul Werstine, `Narratives About Printed Shakespeare Texts: "Foul Papers" and "Bad Quartos"', SQ 41 (1990), p. 69. He urges that we abandon the desire to `fix the origins of the early printed versions upon single agents, when these texts were open to penetration and alteration not only by Shakespeare himself and by his fellow actors but also by multiple theatrical and extra-theatrical scriveners, by theatrical annotators, adapters and revisers (who might cut or add), by censors, and by compositors and proofreaders' (p. 86). See also Gary Taylor, `Post-script', Shakespeare Reshaped , p. 243. 60 Philip Williams, `New Approaches to Textual Problems in Shakespeare', SB 8 (1956), p. 6. Williams, however, believed this copyist to be the same one who transcribed Timon of Athens . 61 Brockbank, Arden ed. Coriolanus , p. 24. 62 OED Both a B 1b (`Extended to more than two objects.'). One of the OED examples is from 1 Henry VI : ` Margaret shall now be Queene, and rule the King: | But I will rule both her, the King, and Realme' (5.5.107-08). 63 Editors have generally assigned all these unnumbered speeches to `First Senator' or `First Soldier', but this procedure gives perhaps unintended prominence to single individuals (though those actors might be grateful). The desired degree of verbal involvement in the action by those on stage might, for a specific production, have been left to the rehearsal stage. In `Editorial Treatment of Foul-Paper Texts: Much Ado About Nothing as Test Case', RES n.s. 31 (1980), Stanley Wells argues against an editorial judgement to assign the 5 unnumbered Watch speeches in 3.3 of that play to `2 Watch ', as is usually done: `To give him all the lines is to build up his part beyond justification, and to make mutes of all the other watchmen; it goes beyond the textual evidence' (p. 11); the point is just as well taken if the copy is a faithful transcript of an author's undesignated original. Editorial assignment of such speeches may do a disservice to a script intentionally left open. 64 It should be noted, however, that in some scenes with entry directions of indefinite number, speeches are all assigned: for instance, of the seven or eight Citizens who enter at the beginning of 2.3, only `1', `2', and `3' speak, and in 5.6 there are speeches for `1', `2', and `3' of the 3 or 4 Conspirators of Auffidius Faction . 65 There are also unnumbered speeches for the Queen's ladies and for the tribunes in Cymbeline , 1.5 and 3.7; 5 speeches for Watch in 3.3 Much Ado About Nothing , although 7 others are specified `I.' or `2'(see n. 63); and in Timon of Athens successive SHs Some speake and Some other at 3.5.86-87, but as these F texts are not thought to have been set from prompt, we cannot know whether a playhouse annotator would have particularised the SHs. Julius Caesar , which is thought to have been set from prompt copy or a transcript of it, has two unnumbered speeches for Sold . in 5.4, but since the next (and only other) two soldier speeches are numbered, the missing specificity for the first two may result from compositorial oversight. 66 In `"Foul Papers" and "Prompt Books": Printer's Copy for Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors ', SB 49 (1988), Werstine observes that SHs for the 2 committeemen who enter at l. 142 in The Launching of the Mary are sometimes `Com: I' but also sometimes `Com:' or `Committ:'; in The Captives appears a SH `woman' when three possible female speakers are on stage (p. 242). On variable SHs in manuscript playbooks, see also Werstine's `McKerrow's "Suggestion" and Twentieth-Century Shakespeare Criticism', RenD , n.s. 19 (1988), pp. 152-53. 67 The revising Hand C in Sir Thomas More , who seems to have been preparing the manuscript for theatrical production, altered only 1 of 10 All SHs in Hand D's 3 pages. F Julius Caesar , set from prompt or a transcript of it, uses All in 3.2 to designate speech for the crowd of plebeians, though in some instances the words clearly should be further distributed among several distinct voices. 68 E. A. J. Honigmann, `Re-Enter the Stage Direction: Shakespeare and Some Contemporaries', ShS 29 (1976), p. 122. Thomas Clayton notes that some All speeches, such as `Speake, speake', call for `not necessarily only two but for n repetitions' (`Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 7). 69 If the scribe that I am hypothesizing made his transcript late, perhaps with the F publication in mind, then he too could have contributed mistakes and misreadings. 70 Clayton, `Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 8. Clayton notes that in this last case, the two uses of All would still require disambiguation; for the possibility of duplicate All s as successive SHs, he points to Giorgio Melchiori's persuasive argument that the two instances of all in l. 38 of More mean some and others (`Hand D in "Sir Thomas More": An essay in Misinterpretation', SB 38 [1985], p. 101). Editors have chosen among these possibilities in their handling of this passage: The Riverside Shakespeare , Brockbank's Arden ed., and Parker's Oxford ed. assume one misplaced SH and so move the existing All up from TLN 1896 to 1894, thus giving all 3 lines to All ; others move All up to 1894 and give this SH 2 lines, but then variously reassign 1896 (Malone to Cit .; Kittredge to Patricians ; Hibbard to Menenius , thus merging 1896 with Menenius' subsequent lines). 71 Such is the reasoning, I assume, on which the Oxford Textual Companion conjectures AEDILES . I find this hypothesis attractive in terms of context and, more guardedly, on bibliographical grounds. Unfortunately, Coriolanus offers no control for this misreading: the only other relevant SH abbreviation is a single instance in 3.3, a scene which uses the spelling `Edile' ( Edi .). We do not know what 'Aed[.]' (or 'Æd[.]'?) in Shakespeare's hand would look like. In Hand D's pages of the More manuscript, SHs are entered in secretary hand (with the exception of one Italian S ), and in this script `All' and `Aed' could be easily mistaken. Indeed, `Aedile' is quite possibily itself a scribal sophistication; if so, and if the miniscule initial letters in the `all' SHs in the More manuscript are any pointers, Shakespeare may have left `edi' without a distinct dot for the final letter, with the result that the abbreviation was mistaken for the commoner `all'. 72 Clayton points out that, on the pattern of Hand D in More , r would more likely be mistaken for m than vice versa, and both the examples here discussed misread in that direction. He also cites a personal letter from George Walton Williams relevant to even shorter abbreviations for these two characters: in Romeo and Juliet `there are many instances in which it is pretty clear that Shakespeare forgot to add the tilde in various contractions' (`Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 25). 73 Brockbank, Arden ed. Coriolanus , pp. 161-62. 74 In his New Shakespeare ed. of Coriolanus , Wilson notes, besides the easy graphical confusion, that `Brut.'s [sic] reply is clearly addressed to Cor.; and Cor. replies in turn' (p. 196). 75 Clayton, `Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 13. Clayton reminds us that Hinman established a considerable break in the printing of quire bb (see p. 000 and n. 7 above), and the bb2 v :5 forme was among those that had to be reset; he also notes that the cruxes on bb2 v a occur in a `span of F lines (TLN 1915-65) that may all have been on the same page' of the manuscript copy (p. 13). 76 Warburton reassigned the first quoted line to Coriolanus; as early as F2 (1632) the second was given a SH for Cominius. 77 Brockbank, Arden ed. Coriolanus , p. 210 n. 78 Clayton offers a version of this argument in `Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 18. In New Readings in Shakespeare , 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1956), C. J. Sisson suggested that TLN 1962-64 were a marginal addition, `prefixed by the compositor in error to the existing speech of Menenius' (2: 127), but Clayton, rightly I think, finds this argument unlikely on grounds of both meter and sense (p. 17). 79 The actor who plays `I. Cit .' would, of course, appreciate the emendation, and his part can be — and has been — strengthened even further through non-verbal stage business in Acts 2 and 3. The role of `I. Cit .' can thus become an attractively substantial minor part for an up-and-coming actor; in some modern productions it has been played by the understudy for Coriolanus, as it was in Peter Hall's 1959 production in which Albert Finney played First Citizen and understudy for Laurence Olivier. 80 Clayton, `Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 12. 81 Wilbur Sanders mounts a persuasive defense of retaining F in Wilbur Sanders and Howard Jacobson, Shakespeare's Magnanimity: Four Tragic Heroes, Their Friends and Families (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1978), p. 140. See also Michael Warren, `Textual Problems, Editorial Assertions in Editions of Shakespeare', in Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. Jerome McGann (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1985), pp. 31-32, and Richard Proudfoot, `Textual Studies', ShS 30 (1977), p. 204. 82 H. Eardley-Wilmot, Times Literary Supplement , 13 October 1950, p. 645. In his New Shakespeare ed. of Coriolanus , Wilson further elaborates on the appropriateness to Sicinius' argument of specifying the disease as gangrene, whereas this would be a tactical error for Menenius (p. 204 n). Brockbank suggests a simple misremembering on the part of Compositor B (Arden ed. Coriolanus , p. 214 n); see also Clayton, `Today We have Parting of Names', pp. 19-20. 83 Theobald conjectured `?', which Steevens adopted in the 1778 Variorum; Malone followed Rowe (1714) in providing a dash to indicate interrupted speech and speculated that had he been allowed to continue, Menenius would have added, `Is this just?'. Replying to Eardley-Wilmot in the TLS and assuming the F punctuation to be correct, A. P. Rossiter defends F's assignment to Menenius as being in character with his `personal style' of `dry irony' ( Times Literary Supplement , 20 October 1950, p. 661. Rossiter's argument does not, however, answer the objections to F made by either Wilson or Clayton (see preceding note). 84 Clayton, `Today We Have Parting of Names', p. 20. 85 Brockbank, who gives the line to Virgilia, finds it only `just conceivable that Coriolanus cries out in apprehension or distress, or even intends a dismissive blasphemy, but either would be inconsistent with the assumed role of "lonely dragon"' (Arden ed. Coriolanus , p. 240 n). 86 In Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses , 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1931), W. W. Greg answered the question of what treatment the book-keeper would acccord the author's SDs: `as a rule he left them alone. So long as they were intelligible it mattered little to him the form in which they were couched' (1: 213) 87 Although he later altered his opinion on this matter, in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1942), W. W. Greg thought a book-keeper might `not trouble to make specific such a direction as "with two or three Lords attendant"' (p. 38). In several articles detailing his study of the surviving manuscript playbooks, William B. Long has presented strong evidence that Greg's early statements, here and in Dramatic Documents (quoted in n. 86) were correct. In `"A bed | for woodstock": A Warning for the Unwary', MARDE 2, ed. J. Leeds Barroll and Paul Werstine (New York: AMS Press, 1985), Long observes that modern bibliographers wrongly demand that the `ideal' late 16th- and 17th-century `"promptbook" should be neat and orderly, containing complete and regular speech-heads, entrances and exits — with all manner of vagueness and ambiguities resolved. Unfortunately, the surviving ... playbooks exhibit no such features, even on an occasional basis' (p. 93). In ` Beggars Bush : A Reconstructed Prompt-Book and Its Copy', SB 27 (1974), Fredson Bowers concurs: `In the surviving playbooks, bookkeepers have not changed playwrights' entrance directions that leave the number of extras indefinite' (p. 94; see also p. 131). In Coriolanus there are 4 lightly permissive entry directions, 10 SDs for a collective body (e.g. the Army of the Volces at 1.4.22/514, or a rabble of Plebeians at 3.1.179/1886), and 9 unspecified with others or with Attendants . 88 In Casting Shakespeare's Plays: London Actors and Their Roles, 1590-1642 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992), T. J. King suggests that the number provided for with Lords / Soldiers / Attendants was usually 3, although it might vary according to the number of mutes required for the play as a whole (p. 34). For Coriolanus , King estimates that 11 men could handle the 16 principal male roles (25 lines or more); along with 3 boys, they would be responsible for 93% of the play's lines. An additional 14 men would be needed for 34 small speaking parts, as well as 4 boys and 30 mutes. According to King's tables, of the F plays only Antony and Cleopatra and Henry VIII require larger casts (see Chap. 4). 89 Long, `"A bed | for woodstock"', pp. 106, 110. In `Modern Textual Theories and the Editing of Plays', The Library , sixth ser. 11 (1989), T. H. Howard-Hill notes that, unlike modern promptbooks, Renaissance playbooks `do not usually record information contained in other necessary playhouse documents', such as actors' parts, casting tables, or the `plot' (p. 111). 90 In the printed, black-letter quarto of A Looking Glass for London and England that has been marked as prompt, `flourish' appears either in the left margin opposite the space for its occurrence or above the printed entry SD (Baskervill, `A Prompt Copy of A Looking Glass for London and England ', p. 37). A hasty annotator might cause ambiguity with either placement. 91 Peter M. Wright argues that these are two distinct SDs, meant to cover movement during a scene change: the Flourish accompanies the departure of the victorious Romans at the end of 1.9, but the Cornets are for Aufidius' entry, or what editors usually mark as 1.10 (`Stage Directions in Two Seventeenth-Century Folios: Ben Jonson's Folio of 1616 and the Shakespeare Folio of 1623', Ph.D. diss., UCLA, 1991, pp. 144-45,n. 14). A flourish, presumably of trumpets, followed by a separate flourish of cornets, while possible, seems unlikely; as John H. Long observes in Shakespeare's Use of Music: The Histories and Tragedies (Gainesville: Univ. of Florida Press, 1971), `the fourish concludes the council just ended by the Romans. There is no reason for Aufidius, who enters defeated..., to be greeted with a fanfare' (pp. 221- 22). 92 In Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont &amp; Fletcher Folio of 1647 (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1938 [for 1937]), R. C. Bald notes this as a typical change made in turning the transcript of a play into the playbook for performance: `careful attention to musical effects and noises off stage in a text is an indication that it has received the producer's attention, and is probably derived from a prompt-copy' (p. 79). The Oxford Textual Companion also notes that the music cues, as well as the detailing of the names of characters in entry directions and the misplaced Exeunt at TLN 1948, suggest a playhouse annotator (p. 593). Brockbank, on the other hand, while seeing `some evidence for the intervention of the book-keeper', finds `it is not decisive' (Arden ed. Coriolanus , p. 5). 93 W. J. Lawrence in Shakespeare's Workshop (rpt.; New York: Haskell House, 1966) notes that at the beginning of the 17th c. cornets are associated with the indoor private theatres, where their softer tone could be used more effectively than in the public amphitheatres (pp. 52-53). The King's Men acquired Blackfriars in August 1608, although all playing was prohibited due to plague until at least November 1609; Lawrence takes the call for cornets as a pointer to dating Coriolanus , `which cannot have been produced before the end of November 1609, and seems more likely to have seen the light a month or two later. In either case it would have been a Blackfriars production' (p. 63); see also Long, Shakespeare's Use of Music , pp. 222, 228-29, and Oxford Textual Companion , p. 594. Though less likely, Coriolanus could have been composed early in 1608 and opened at the Globe in the spring, before plague closed the theatres, then been reannotated for a subsequent Blackfriars performance. Such appears to have been the case with All's Well and Merchant of Venice , which also mix trumpets and cornets in flourishes; All's Well exists only in its F form; Q1 Merchant (1600) lacks any reference to cornets. See n. 55 for T. W. Baldwin's suggestion that Coriolanus had received a production not long before work on F began. 94 The first doubling at 2.1.0.2 may have been authorial ( Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the | people, Sicinius &amp; Brutus ), since `commonly Shakespeare identified a character at his first entrance with a label stating his rank, profession, or relationship to another character' (Honigmann, The Stability of Shakespeare's Text , p. 147); these labels are only rarely repeated, however, so the latter instances are likely to be those of an annotator making sure that entry directions included the names of all the scene's important characters. Even at 2.1.0.2, the order suggests that the tribunes' proper names may have been tacked onto an existing direction (in contrast, 1.3.0 begins Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife to Martius ). See also the Oxford Textual Companion , p. 593, on this point. 95 A SD Retire or Aside for First and Second Servingman at 4.5.52/2707 would be helpful, but only Capell, followed by Keightley, has been seriously confused by its absence. For another possible example in 1.4, Enter Martius Cursing , see p. 000 above and n. 98; Troilus and Cressida , 4.5.158, offers another instance where Enter applies to characters who have previously only gone `aside'. 96 Bowers notes that the `common failure to mark ordinary and expectable exits wanting in Massinger's papers shows that scrupulous attention to exit directions is no absolute criterion for prompt-copy' (` Beggars Bush : A Reconstructed Prompt-Book and Its Copy', p. 132); see also Gary Taylor, `"Praestat difficilior lectio": All's Well that Ends Well ', Renaissance Studies 2 (1988), p. 40. Some or all may also have existed in the manuscript but been omitted by oversight or because of space constraints (the probable cause of the missing exit SD for 1.8 and the shorter Exit for Exeunt at the end of 1.7); they may also have been clear in the actors' parts, though unnoted in the playbook. 97 1.4 presents Coriolanus 's major staging challenge, though the SDs may have been less confusing in the manuscript copy, before Compositor B got through with it. Still, on the basis of a non-Shakespearean playbook, Fredson Bowers concludes that `If Knight's transcript of this prompt- book from Massinger's papers is at all typical, it is evident that unresolved tangles in the action and even in the casting could be transferred to print from a prompt-book or transcript' (` Beggars Bush : A Reconstructed Prompt-Book and Its Copy', p. 135); see also Baskervill, `A Prompt Copy of A Looking Glass for London and England ', pp. 50-51, and Oxford, Textual Companion , p. 387. 98 J. W. Saunders, `Vaulting the Rails', ShS 7 (1954), p. 77. In his view, no exit is required because neither Marius nor the Roman soldiers really leave (or leave our sight). The SD Enter Martius Cursing is `similar to those illogically entered in other plays, when a player has not left the stage but has moved between two different visible areas'. Modern productions often employ a similar solution, with the Romans retreating to the verge of the stage or even the centre steps and centre aisle; Titus exits fighting and re-enters from the same direction to comment on Martius' bravery (so staged in the 1984 Peter Hall production at the National Theatre). Martius may exit fighting and almost immediately re-enter cursing, or he may be visible driving off the Volscians. 99 The centred SD Enter the Gati also suggests Compositor B might have been led by an ambiguous terminal symbol to see Gati instead of Gates and to assume another army is indicated. Just above, at TLN 514, he had centred Enter the Army of the Volces ; here, at TLN 543, he centres what was presumably a marginal action-direction for what is in effect an exit. 100 The fact that aa3 v is B's first page of Coriolanus may mean that, as yet unfamiliar with the play and especially its proper names, he was trying to follow his copy closely. Had he been willing at 1.7.0 to alter his spelling, use an &amp; and jettison Caius , as he may have done in the first column and again at 1.8.0, he could either have saved a line for white space (1.7.0.4 is only one word long, Scout ), or achieved his preferred direction format. With the exception of this instance and the short entry direction on aa1 v , he elsewhere sets simply Martius in his Act 1 Sds. 101 The Oxford Textual Companion finds Enters an additional argument for scribal copy, since the indicative rather than imperative form `does not elsewhere appear in texts thought to be set from Shakespeare's papers' (p. 593). Yet this SD seems one of the most `authorial' in the play, containing information that neither paid scribe nor compositor would be likely to know, and in fact the indicative form does appear elsewhere in a text believed to have been set from holograph: Q1 Richard II , on B2 and I1 (at 1.3.6 and 5.2.84 in the Riverside edition). Alternatively, Enters could be a scribal addition, but it might also derive from a playhouse annotator or from a compositor's correction for having failed to head the SD with Enter . Its capitalisation suggests it may have been written in the margin of Compositor B's copy, perhaps even as Enter , meant to head the SD but miscued (or its cue misread) as to placement. 102 In his New Shakespeare ed. of Coriolanus , Wilson finds it `obvious that Auf.'s [sic] address to the Volscians precedes their being "driven in breathless"' (p. 167). Many editors still retain F, however, and simply add Exit for Aufidius after his final two lines. 103 On bb5, for instance, Compositor B has managed to get the second servingman's speech at 4.5.3-4/2657 onto one line by abbreviating `master' as `M.', sacrificing two of the three spaces after punctuation marks, and leaving off the period after Exit . Mislineation at TLN 2659-60 is probably intentional, so that the first half-line would leave a bit of white space under Enter Coriolanus , and running lines 2664 and 2665 together as prose allows room in the right margin for the off-center Enter second Servant . 104 Discussing the combining of two verse lines into one as a compositorial space-saving technique, Werstine notes that on aa3 `the combined verses occur near the bottom of the second column where there is no white space around two entrance directions' (`Line Division', p. 120 n. 38). 105 In setting the two penultimate pages of F 1 Henry 4 from printed copy, Compositor B compressed his copy by shortening SDs to hold them to one line and by omitting one altogether on f5 v , at TLN 3066 (cutting from K3 of the quarto He spieth Falstaffe on the ground ); see Eleanor Prosser, Shakespeare's Anonymous Editors (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1981), p. 202 n. 21. In The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2: 508, Hinman notes B's probable omission of a SD in Antony and Cleopatra , due to poorly cast-off manuscript copy. On B's willingness to tamper with his copy's SDs, see also Werstine, `Compositor B of the Shakespeare First Folio', pp. 252, 257-59, and Williams, `New Approaches to Textual Problems in Shakespeare', p. 8. 106 There are other mis-settings on this page (bb1 v ), such as mislineation and Latius in the entry SD and SHs in 3.1. The mislineation is quite likely at least in part Compositor A's but, as argued above, the Latius misnaming probably stood in the copy. The unnumbered senatorial SH at 3.1.31/1712 may be related to an economising impulse, since the line is justified only by eliminating the usual space after the SH period, but senators are either unnumbered (two more on this page alone) or erratically numbered in the rest of this scene, in both compositors' stints and where justification is not an issue. 107 Honigmann, `Re-Enter the Stage Direction', p. 119. 108 In `New Approaches to Textual Problems in Shakespeare', Philip Williams observes that Compositor A tended to reproduce the copy position of SDs; Compositor B was more likely to normalise, and he `was reluctant to interrupt a speech to insert even a needed stage-direction' (p. 7). Williams does not, however, offer his evidence for this assertion; see below, n. 110. 109 In `Justification and Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B', SB 27 (1974), S. W. Reid provides evidence that `when justifying a line B generally altered types toward the end of it before changing those toward the beginning' (p. 110). TLN 3538 is a case in point, for a shorter spelling of `vntill' would have allowed Compositor B to set the sentence's terminal period. 110 Five lines earlier in the same speech B does split a verse line in order to set Drum a farre off in the right margin, rather than set the SD on its own separate line, but farther down the same column a sound and action SD breaks up Coriolanus' tirade to the Roman soldiers. If Compositor B had a preference for uninterrupted speeches, it was not a particularly strong one. As noted earlier, in the second column of aa3 one sound cue has probably been left out because there was no room in the margin next to `Hark', and by this time B could not spare a separate line.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">More on Dr. Hoadly's 'Poems Set to Music by Dr. Greene' by H. Diack Johnstone</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Florimel, or Love's Revenge, a Dramatic Pastoral in two interludes, was the first of six large-scale musical works by Maurice Greene for which the words were written by John Hoadly, sometime Chaplain to the Prince of Wales and youngest son of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly, one of the most celebrated of eighteenth-century Anglican divines. The Bishop is said to have had a particular liking for music and the theatre which, in his calling, he found it impossible to gratify without impropriety; thus it was probably in the drawing room at Farnham Castle, the episcopal seat, that the piece was first performed in 1734. Though it was never done in any of the London theatres, it does seem to have been quite widely performed (in 'still life' as Burney might have said), and no fewer than six manuscript sources survive--which is at least double the number for any other English 'opera' of the period. A facsimile of the earliest and most important of these has recently been issued by Stainer &amp; Bell in their prestigious Music for London Entertainment series. 1 No sooner had it appeared than my attention was drawn to Keith Maslen's article on 'Dr. Hoadly's "Poems Set to Music by Dr. Greene"' in the 1995 issue of this journal (vol. 48, pp. 85-94). By printing cast lists not only for Florimel (or Love's Revenge as Hoadly himself preferred to call it), but also for the various other musico-dramatic pieces in which they collaborated, the article provides valuable new evidence on the performance history of these works. Viewed from the musicological side of the fence, however, there is still a good deal more to be said of some of the personalities involved, and also of Hoadly's other poetic contributions to the English vocal repertoire of the period. Hoadly came down from Cambridge with an LL.B. in the summer of 1735 and immediately decided to become a clergyman in order that, as the D.N.B. puts it, 'he might avail himself of the rich patronage at his father's disposal'. Five years earlier, Greene had taken a Cambridge doctorate of music and, 'in compliment to his performance' there, had been elected to a purely titular professorship in the subject. It must therefore have been while John Hoadly was still a student at the university that Love's Revenge was written and first performed. Quite how Greene came to be so intimate with the family--and Benjamin Hoadly, the elder brother (1706-57), was later to serve as an executor of Greene's estate--we do not know, but it was almost certainly through the Bishop, who seems to have been a friend of the composer's father during his own early days as a City parson and Minor Canon of St Paul's. 2 Greene was no doubt a frequent visitor to Farnham Castle, and it was there in May 1737 that he began work on his Service in C. Among other visitors to Farnham during this same period was another friend of the family, William Hogarth, who, commenting on the Hoadlys' passion for amateur theatricals (and John's in particular), says that 'few visitors were ever long in [the] house before they were solicited to accept a part in some interlude or other'. 3 Exactly who was involved in the 1734 premiere of Love's Revenge we do not know, but I suspect it was an essentially domestic affair in which the parts of Florimel, Myrtillo and Cupid (all trebles) were sung by three of the more accomplished boy choristers from St Paul's Cathedral or the Chapel Royal, and that of the Satyr (a bass) quite possibly by the composer himself, especially since he is known to have sung the part at a later performance of the work given at his own house in Beaufort Buildings just off the Strand. But the cast list of this later performance and also the one which took place at the Apollo Academy are to be found not only in the Otago copy of the 1737 Winchester libretto cited by Maslen: they are also written by hand in another copy of the same edition which is now in the Royal College of Music, London (press-mark XXI.C.IV), the only difference being that there is no mention of 'Mr. Abbott' whose name, in the Otago copy, is scored through and replaced by 'Mr. Mence'. The Rev. John Abbott (bass) died on 18 February 1744 and his place in the Chapel Royal choir was taken by the Rev. Anselm Bayly. The fact that 'Mr. Bailley' figures in this particular cast list along with Benjamin Mence and William Savage, all of whom gained their Chapel Royal appointments in the spring of that same year (1744), suggests that the Apollo Academy performance--in which the Rev. Edward Lloyd evidently sang the part of Cupid--was almost certainly the one referred to in The Daily Advertiser of 11 January 1745 as having taken place the night before. 4 As for the singers who were involved in the performance at Greene's house, 'Miss Gilbert, afterwards Mrs. Bowes' can be identified as the wife (from 1743?) of George Bowes, a wealthy Whig landowner and popular member of Parliament for Co. Durham (1727-60). The family were generous patrons of the arts, and especially of music, and Greene visited them at their North Country home, Gibside, superbly situated on the heights overlooking the Derwent, near Gateshead, in June 1750. 5 Of 'Miss Ayliffe' and 'Mr Hastings' nothing whatever is known, but since the latter evidently sang the part of Myrtillo, it must almost certainly have been the later version of the work in which all the music for this character was assigned to a countertenor which was done on this particular occasion. From the engraving of Apollo and his lyre on the title-page of the earliest printed libretto (London, 1734), we may safely infer that the work was taken up by the Academy very shortly after its first performance. Rather surprisingly perhaps--or was it simply that the text was too long?--the words were not included in A Miscellany of Lyric Poems, The Greatest Part written for, And performed in The Academy of Music, Held in the Apollo published in London in 1740; this does, however, contain the text of another joint Greene-Hoadly production, the undated masque 'The Judgment [ sic ] of Hercules' whose score was last heard of in 1832 (when it was listed in the library sale catalogue of Thomas Greatorex, recently deceased). It is interesting that Hoadly himself calls it 'The Choice of Hercules', whereas Robert Lowth in his versified treatment of the same subject later adapted for setting by Handel in 1751 originally opted for 'Judgment'. 6 The other 'Choice of Hercules' referred to by Maslen (whose remarks are based on the somewhat confused account given by Roger Fiske in his English Theatre Music in the Eighteenth Century ) is by Greene's pupil, John Stanley (1712-86), and is actually earlier. The librettist in this case is unknown, but the music was evidently composed somewhere round about 1730, 7 "&gt; 7 and there is absolutely no reason to suppose it was never performed (or that it was unknown to Greene and Hoadly either for that matter). Though Fiske does not fail to mention 'The Judgment of Hercules' by Shenstone (1741), he appears not to have noticed that there were yet two more poems with the same title, one by Joseph Mitchell published in 1727, the other by Peter Layng in 1748. 8 "&gt; 8 Of the two 1745 editions of Love's Revenge , the one printed in London most probably relates to the performance at Greene's Apollo Academy referred to above, the other (with no specified place of publication) to a performance by various members of the Chapel Royal, Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral choirs under the direction of the composer at Gloucester on 4 September 1745 as part of that year's Three Choirs Festival programme. The work was also done at the Winchester Festival in 1768 and at the Hampshire Music Meeting in 1781, but the only other edition of the libretto was apparently printed for a London performance given by the Castle Society at Haberdashers' Hall on 21 March 1757. The Greene-Hoadly oratorio Jephtha (1737), likewise survives, musically speaking, in two versions. In one, Jephtha's daughter (unnamed) is cast as a soprano ( or boy treble more likely), and in the other as a countertenor. It is interesting that, in the cast list quoted by Maslen, the part was taken by 'Mrs. Lampe', and that Hoadly himself says the performance took place 'at ye. Academy in the Apollo' since all the evidence hitherto available has suggested that, as with the 1745 performance of Love's Revenge referred to above, the Academy's concerts seem normally to have been all-male affairs. In his Handel: A Documentary Biography (1954), Otto Erich Deutsch refers to a production of the work at the King's Theater in the Haymarket in Lent 1737, but he does not state his source, and no evidence in support of this assertion has yet come to light. 'Mr. Abbott' (who sang the part of Jephtha) was, as has already been noted, one of Greene's colleagues at St Paul's and the Chapel Royal. So too were the two Elders, Messrs. 'Whaley' (Samuel Weely, d. 1743) and (David) 'Cheriton' (d. 1758). In his libretto, Hoadly lays a good deal of emphasis on the notion of Jephtha as Patriot King, in doing so, he no doubt sought to interest and impress his employer, the Prince of Wales (whose Chaplain he became almost immediately after his ordination in December 1735). 9 As with the masque, The Choice of Hercules , the words only of the oratorio The Force of Truth now survive. According to the Gentleman's Magazine in its 'Memoirs of the Life of the late Dr. John Hoadly' (April 1776, p.165) and repeated verbatim in the Annual Register (xix), the piece was written 'for his friend Dr. Green's academy at the Apollo'. A score and parts, apparently autograph, is listed in the sale catalogue of the library of Greene's pupil, William Boyce, in April 1779, and was last heard of in 1822. Both soloists named by Hoadly in the Otago copy of the libretto have already been identified in connection with the 1745 Academy performance of Love's Revenge . Without the music it is difficult to be certain, but the 'Miss Young' who sang Pleasure in The Choice of Hercules is most likely perhaps to have been Esther, the younger sister of Mrs. Lampe (née Young) who was Virtue on the same occasion. Cecilia Young (1711-89), another member of the same family, is the only other possible candidate, but she was, by this date, normally singing under her married name as Mrs Arne. The three-act pastoral opera Phoebe (1747), though musically (and dramatically) a better work than Love's Revenge , was nothing like so successful, and only one public performance is recorded: at a benefit for John Robinson, the organist of Westminster Abbey, in Mr Ogle's Great Room, Dean Street, Soho, on 16 January 1755. That it was also done by the Apollo Academy has hitherto been a matter of conjecture, and Keith Maslen is quite right in assuming 'Mr. Beard' to have been John Beard, the celebrated tenor. Of the other singers named, only Messrs. 'Wasse' and 'Jones' (who evidently took on both female roles) have yet to be identified. Robert Wass is no problem, for he too was a member of the St Paul's, Westminster Abbey and Chapel Royal choirs from 1743-45 until his death in 1764. Who Jones was is more difficult to say, but probably the singer concerned is the little-known David Jones who was appointed a Lay Vicar at the Abbey in May 1743 and died in January 1751. 10 Two other works by Hoadly, Love's Artifice and The Song of Moses , are also mentioned by Maslen who wonders apropos of the first whether 'it was ever set to music, but only intended to be, and never performed?'. The same question also applies to The Song of Moses . The answer is to be found in a letter from Hoadly to David Garrick dated 27 August 1775 in which he lists his various dramatic works as "Love's Revenge" (a printed book) where Florimel is introduced . . . " Phoebe," a whole Pastoral Opera of three acts, . . . "Love's Artifice," a Mask, from "Don Quixote." "The Choice of Hercules," A Mask, set by Dr.G. "The Song of Moses," paraphrased for music. [and] "The Beggar's Garland," a ballad scene, which I imagine . . . would be a fine thing for Sadler's Wells. 11 It seems that, a month or so earlier, Hoadly had sent copies of most of these pieces to Garrick, 12 and that Garrick, unaware of the fact that the music took three quarters of an hour to perform, evidently had some idea of including The Choice of Hercules as part of a rather longer entertainment which he was then planning to stage. Also in Garrick's hands were the words of 'my two (unset) pieces' which Hoadly asks him to send on to 'Mr. Linley' in Bath as soon as may be convenient. These were 'Love's Artifice' and 'The Song of Moses'. The Mr. Linley' referred to is Thomas Linley (1733-95), composer, harpsichordist, concert manager and distinguished teacher of singing, who was then still based in Bath but was shortly to become joint manager of Drury Lane with his son-in-law, Richard Brinsley Sheridan. In a letter to Hoadly dated 22 September 1775, Linley announced his intention of setting both. 13 Though he evidently thought the latter rather better than the former, in the event he never got round to either. He did , however, pass the libretto of 'The Song of Moses' on to his son, Thomas (1756-78), much the most promising young English composer of the age, whose oratorio of the same title was first performed at Drury Lane on 12 March 1777. 14 By that time, however, Hoadly was dead and Garrick had retired. Towards the end of his Drury Lane career, Garrick was, as Dougald MacMillan points out, 'forced, by the policy of Covent Garden and by the vogue of comic opera, to rely more and more upon musical pieces'. 15 This no doubt explains why he was actively considering The Choice of Hercules . Writing to Garrick again on 10 September 1775, Hoadly also tried to interest him in Love's Revenge , a copy of which, 'hashed and slashed', he enclosed with his letter: Part of the overture, we agreed, should be left out. That of the second interlude (minuet with French horns) I would certainly retain, as it is so very pleasing and so adapted to the Satyr's appearance. (That gentleman's motions and songs would admit of something in the comic cast.) You may be able to abridge it a little, by leaving out some of the Da Capos. That will be best judged, when you hear it altogether. I think the repetition of the duet in chorus will be a good ending, without the intended grand chorus; and the few lines which I have taken from the songs, and added to the speaker, will be necessary. 16 As things turned out, this idea too was destined never to get off the ground. In the same letter, Hoadly claims to have written the words of the enormously popular song 'The Early Horn' composed, he says, 'for Rich, in the Cambridge stage-coach, [in] 1731' and shortly afterwards set to music by J. E. Galliard whom Hoadly describes as 'a most genteel and knowing composer'. 17 But this piece (beginning 'With early horn salute the morn that gilds this charming place') was only one of several youthful poetic jeux d'esprit intended for musical setting. The Hoadly obituary memoir in the Gentleman's Magazine also mentions 'the famous ballad Fair Sally lov'd a bonny seaman' set by Greene in 1736, 18 and 'several other pieces printed in Dodsley's poems, vol. v. p. 258, &amp;c.'. The reference here is to volume five of A Collection of Poems . . . By Several Hands published by Robert Dodsley in 1758 where, on pp. 258-268, is to be found 'Kambromyomaxia: or the Mouse-Trap; Being a Translation of Mr. Holdsworth's Muscipula, 1737. By ****.' Though anonymous on the page, the author is identified in a list of 'Names . . . not [otherwise] mentioned in the Six Volumes of Miscellanies', and prefixed to volume one, as 'Dr. Hoadley' [ sic ]. In the 1782 edition (with notes by Isaac Reed), 19 "&gt; 19 the words are actually ascribed to 'Dr. John Hoadly', while the next several poems in both--pp. 269-288 in the 1758 edition--are 'By the Same'. First come the 'Verses under the Prints of Mr. Hogarth's Rake's Progress, 1735'--one for each of the eight plates--then three poems headed 'On the Friendship of two young Ladies, 1730', 'Chloe's unknown Likeness, 1738,' and 'The Bird of Passage, 1749'. These are followed by six lines of French verse 'said to be fixed on the Gate at the Louvre at Paris. 1751' (with translations into both English and Latin), and then (on pp. 280-281) 'Chloe resolved. A Ballad. Set to Music by Dr. Green. 1743'. 20 Next we have an 'Epilogue to Shakespear's first Part of King Henry IV, acted by Young Gentlemen at Mr. Newcome's School at Hackney, 1748', 21 a 'Prologue to Comus. Performed at the Benefit of the General Hospital at Bath, 1756; And spoken by Miss Morrison, in the Character of a Lady of Fashion', and then, finally, eleven 'Epigrams from Martial' dedicated, like the lines quoted by Maslen in n.8, to James ('Hermes') Harris of Salisbury. Also identified as John Hoadly in the 1782 edition is the 'J.H.' who, on p. 248, is said to have written the lines headed 'To the Rev. Mr. J.S. 1731'. 22 According to Bishop Percy in his MS list of 'Concealed Names &amp;c.' appended to each volume of his copy of the 1758 edition, there are also two items by 'Chancellor [i.e., John] Hoadley' in volume six. One is the poem on p. 229 headed 'To Chloe, written on the Author's Birth Day', the other the piece entitled 'The Indolent' on pp. 294-295. While most of Percy's Hoadly attributions are confirmed by the editor of the 1782 edition, this latter one, curiously, is not. 'To Chloe', on the other hand, was also printed in volume three, and there appears as the last but one of another group of verses which Thomas Percy likewise maintained was the work of Chancellor Hoadly. 23 In this he was evidently supported by Walpole, 24 although the first of these poems (and by implication all the others in the same group) was quite unambiguously assigned to brother Benjamin in 1782. Which of the two was actually responsible is anyone's guess, but, in view of John Hoadly's longstanding association with the composer (who also set some of these lines as well), the chances are that Percy and Walpole together are more likely to have been right than Reed. 25 Much the most important of these are six cantatas (pp. 255-265 in the 1758 edition) entitled 'The Trophy' and dedicated, in the wake of Culloden, 'To the Honour of his Royal Highness William, Duke of Cumberland; Expressing the just Sense of a grateful Nation, in the several Characters of The Volunteer, The Poet, The Painter, The Musician, The Shepherd, [and] The Religious'. Greene's music is said to have been written in 1746, but if so, it too has long since disappeared. Also set by Greene is the song (on pp. 271-273) beginning 'To silent groves, where weeping yew With sadly mournful cypress join'd'. 26 This is the last of the Hoadly group of poems in Dodsley's original third volume. Between this and 'The Trophy' lies the afore-mentioned 'To Chloe', here said (p. 270) to have been 'Written on my Birth-Day, 1734', and two further items. One, 'On a Bay-Leaf, pluck'd from Virgil's Tomb, near Naples', is dated 1736, the other, 'The Marriage of the Myrtle and the Yew. A Fable. To Delia, about to marry beneath herself', 1744. The overall sequence therefore is chronological, from the most recent (1746) to the earliest [1731]. By no means all these poems were intended for music, but some were, and those eight in Dodsley's volumes three and five which were set by Greene, together with 'Fair Sally,' must surely have been among the missing leaves of the Otago Hoadly volume which Dr. Maslen describes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Postscript Since this volume went to press, I have learned that the huge collection of papers belonging to James ('Hermes') Harris (1709-80)--formerly in the private library of the Earl of Malmesbury, and briefly mentioned by Clive Probyn in the Bibliography to his Harris biography of 1991 ( The Sociable Humanist , p. 355)--has now been placed in the Hampshire County Record Office in Winchester, and will shortly become available to scholars wishing to explore the wealth of new material it contains. Included in the collection are no fewer than 32 letters from John Hoadly to Harris. Most have nothing to do with music, but there are two which are directly relevant to three works ( The Choice of Hercules , The Force of Truth , and The Song of Moses ) discussed above; a third relates to the availability of performing parts of Florimel which Harris was, it appears, planning to perform in Salisbury sometime in the winter season of 1743-44, while a fourth not quoted here (Malmesbury Collection, 9M73/G485/9) would seem to confirm Hoadly's authorship of the set of six cantatas ('The Trophy') mentioned above (and sent to Greene for setting sometime prior to 28 October 1746). The Harris papers also contain a great many references to Handel, music and theatrical performances generally; an edition of these (scheduled for publication by the Oxford University Press) is being prepared by the County Archivist, Miss Rosemary Dunhill, and Professor Donald Burrows, who very kindly drew the correspondence to my attention. I am also greatly indebted to the Earl of Malmesbury for permission to reproduce the substance of these three letters here. In the transcriptions which follow, standard eighteenth-century contractions like 'ye.', 'yt.', 'wch.', and 'wd.' have been silently expanded into 'the', 'that', 'which'- and 'would' respectively. The first letter (Malmesbury Collection, 9M73/G485/2) is dated Wolvesey House, Winchester, 17 December 1739, and is addressed, some what teasingly, to 'My dear Lord Harris' (in Salisbury). It reads: You are a Day after the Fair: for I had shown Hercules to Greene, when I saw him at Farnham at the end of the Summer; &amp; he has since beg'd it of me to set for the Devil [i.e., the tavern in Fleet Street, next Temple Bar, in whose 'Great Room' the meetings of the Apollo Academy were held]; which is so great a Preferment for a young Clergyman's Compositions, that I own, I cou'd not resist it: but it would have been in a fairer Way of being damn'd , if Mr. Handel had had it; as, I suppose, he design'd it for the Publick.--I shou'd not care by any means to have my Name set to anything of that sort; but if I could be serviceable without the Danger of having my Name up, (for a very diminutive Performance serves nowadays to set a man's Name up,) I shou'd be glad to oblige Mr. Handel &amp; You; or rather You &amp; Mr. Handel.--If You, or He, have any other proper subject in your Head, I will work it up for You into any Form you please, whether Oratorical, Operatical, or anyhowical--provided it don't take up a great Deal of Time; &amp; I may lye snug behind the Curtain.--But to say the Truth, I had rather not meddle at all with it, if it is meant for the Publick.--I have read over again what I have writ, &amp; think 'tis something like One of the late Master of the Rolls's Speeches, where first, he is positive[ly] Ay--then he is as positive No--then he doubts--&amp; is extreme sorry he cannot say both Ay &amp; No--but at last resolves to say neither Ay, nor No.--So the World makes what it pleases of it, as I beg You would do of this worthy Epistle . . . The second (9M73/G906) was written on 5 November 1743 and sent to Harris from Hoadly's fashionable London residence in Grosvenor Street. As is apparent from the letter, Greene was at that very moment involved in the composition of The Force of Truth . The work referred to in the first paragraph, however, is the libretto of The Song of Moses , an autograph copy of which Hoadly includes with the letter. The postscript is followed by the same 'Sonnet in the Manner of Milton' as also appears in the Otago manuscript and is quoted by Keith Maslen in his article in vol. 48, p. 90 (n. 10); but for a couple of very minor changes in the text and the usual differences of spelling, punctuation and capitalization, the two are virtually identical. I hope This will catch You before you go for Bath, that you may have a little something a brewing in your Head, while you are at that Place of total Idleness. You hinted once that something of this Kind wou'd be agreable, if a Prospect of too much Work did not frighten You. I hope 3 Airs, 3 Choruses, &amp; a Duet will not have that terrible Effect upon You; tho' I own the Subject is great, &amp; worthy of your Gravity, &amp; great Skill in Chromatics. Greene's Papers [see letter 3] are ready box'd up for You, whenever you please to send for them. He has made a great Progress in my Oratorio [ The Force of Truth ], &amp; most delightfully is it express'd: which is all that the Poet can wish, or pretend to understand. . . . P.S. I propose to inscribe the Oratorio to Mrs Bowes, who was formerly the Florimel of my Pastoral; &amp; have enclos'd the following Lines on that Occasion. The third letter (9M73/G485/4) was sent from Winchester just a month earlier (8 October 1743) to inform Harris that he [Hoadly] had just receiv'd a Line from Dr. Greene about the Pastoral [i.e., Florimel ]. He has found among his Papers 1 first Viol: [,] 1 2d. Viol: [,] a Tenor, the 1st: and 2d. Hautboy Parts, and those of the two French Horns. The Voice Parts were sung by Ladies, who have lost 'em [is this perhaps a reference to the performance at Greene's own house?], He sung himself out of the score, &amp; the Basses play'd from thence too. He desires his humble service to You, &amp; says You are very wellcome to any or all of these for a Time, whenever you please. A Line to Him at Beaufort Buildings will find him next Week, &amp; he is ready to do as You shall direct him.</field>

Diack Johnstone, Music for London Entertainment 1660-1800 , Series C Volume 6 (London, 1995). 2 The Rev. Thomas Greene (1648-1720), sometime Fellow of Peterhouse, was Vicar of the united parishes of St Olave, Jewry, and St Martin, Ironmonger Lane; he was also a canon of Salisbury Cathedral and one of His Majesty's 48 Chaplains in Ordinary. Hoadly is several times mentioned in Thomas Greene's diaries still in the possession of the family. 3 John Nichols, Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth (London, 1781), p. 35. The D.N.B. ( s.v. ' Hoadly, John') remarks that on one such occasion Hogarth, together with Garrick and Hoadly, 'enacted a vulgar parody on the ghost scene in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"'. This particular 'performance' evidently took place at Hoadly's Old Alresford Rectory in July 1746; for further details, see Ronald Paulson, Hogarth: His Life, Art and Times (New Haven, 1971), vol. ii, pp. 32-34. 4 Bayly had in fact been a gentleman of the Chapel Royal since January 1741, and in his case the 1744 appointment was to a Priest's place. For details (as also of those various other members of the St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and Chapel Royal choirs who sang for both Greene and Handel), see Donald Burrows, 'Handel and the English Chapel Royal during the reigns of Queen Anne and King George I' (Ph.D. dissertation, Open University, 1981), vol. 2, appendix 5. The Apollo Academy, a semi-private London musical society, had been founded by Greene sometime between 1731 and 1733 and met in the 'Great Room' at the Devil Tavern, Temple Bar. 5 There are various references to George Bowes and his family in Edward Hughes' North Country Life in the Eighteenth Century (London, 1952). The Bowes' only child, a daughter, married John Lyon, the tyrannical 9th Earl of Strathmore in 1767, and her fascinating life-story is told by Ralph Arnold in The Unhappy Countess and her Grandson John Bowes (London, 1957). The autograph of the last of Greene's orchestrally accompanied settings of the Te Deum (Bodleian, MS Mus. c. 17) is dated 'Gibside June 27 1750'. 6 The Judgment of Hercules, a poem . By a student of Oxford (Glasgow, 1743). As printed in the third volume of Robert Dodsley's Collection of Poems (1748), however, it is entitled 'The Choice of Hercules'. 7 See A. Glyn Williams, 'The Life and Works of John Stanley (1712-86)', (Ph.D. thesis, University of Reading, 1977), ii, 34. 8 See D.F. Foxon, English Verse 1701-1750 (Cambridge, 1975). All were ultimately based on an episode in Xenophon's Memorabilia , and so too, it appears, was Thomas Cooke's The Tryal of Hercules, an ode on glory, virtue and pleasure (1752). 9 For a full discussion of this point, see Ruth Smith's fascinating book, Handel's Oratorios and Eighteenth-Century Thought (Cambridge, 1995), pp. 338-344. 10 Information from Donald Burrows op. cit ., vol. ii, p. 162v. 11 See The Private Correspondence of David Garrick With the Most Celebrated Persons Of His Time , 2 vols. [ed. James Boaden] (London 1831-32), vol. ii, p.81. The Beggar's Garland ('all in songs') is also referred to in a letter from Hoadly to Garrick dated 28 April 1771 ( ibid ., vol. i, pp. 420-421), and in a couple of later letters too. One of these (i, 524) claims the 'chief novelty' of the piece to be the fact that it consists entirely of songs 'without any recitative or prose speaking'. For details of Hoadly's other dramatic works and publications not mentioned here, see D.N.B. and the various Hoadly letters printed in Boaden op. cit . ; also George Winchester Stone, Jr. and George M. Kahrl, David Garrick: A Critical Biography (Carbondale, 1979), pp. 106-112. A letter of 2 February 1772 (i, 457) would seem to suggest that John himself actually had a hand in Benjamin Hoadly's celebrated play, 'The Suspicious Husband' (1747). 12 See also letter of 25 July 1775 ( ibid ., pp. 68-69). 13 Ibid ., pp. 99-101. In the letter, Linley goes on at some length (and quite interestingly too) about the kinds of words which he regarded as most suitable for setting to music. Linley's intention of setting both 'as soon and in the best manner I am able' is reaffirmed in a letter to Garrick of 28 September ( ibid ., pp. 101-102). 14 The score is in the Royal Music Library at the British Library, MS R.M. 21.h.9. 15 Dougald MacMillan, Drury Lane Calendar, 1747-1776 (Oxford, 1938), p. xxviii. 16 Private Correspondence of David Garrick , vol. ii, pp. 93-94. The use of a speaker was obviously designed to shorten the work in performance by getting rid of the recitative and by incorporating the gist of some at least of the airs in the spoken text. 17 The song was incorporated in a pantomime by Edward Phillips called 'The Royal Chace; or, Merlin's Cave' and first produced, with music by Galliard, at Covent Garden on 23 January 1736. It was first published later that same year in vol. v of The British Musical Miscellany . Fiske's suggestion ( op . cit ., p. 165) that it was 'probably written . . . for Jupiter and Europa in 1723' is unfounded. To my colleague, Dr Thomas Keymer, I owe the alternative suggestion that the piece might conceivably have been written for inclusion in The Contrast, a burlesque (never printed) which was apparently hatched up by John and Benjamin Hoadly jointly, first performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 30 April 1731, and almost immediately withdrawn at the insistence, it seems, of their father, the Bishop (see Martin C. Battestin, Henry Fielding: A Life [London, 1989], p. 201; also Stone and Kahrl, op . cit ., p. 107 18 April 1776 issue, p. 165. The words were first published in the Gentleman's Magazine for October 1736 as 'A Song. By Mr. H.', and with Greene's music in vol. vi of The British Music Miscellany [1736]. It was also available as a single half-sheet song under the title of 'The Bonny Seaman' and, as 'Fair Sally', it was included in Greene's anonymously published The Chaplet, being a Collection of Twelve English Songs (1738). Some fifty years later, the poem was also set by John Percy and, in a paraphrased form, by James Hook. It consists of six seven-line stanzas, the first of which is as follows: Fair Sally lov'd a bonny seaman, With Tears she sent him out to roam, Young Thomas lov'd no other Woman, But left his Heart with her at home. She view'd the Sea from off the Hill, And while she turn'd the Spinning -Wheel, Sung of her bonny seaman. Greene's setting has recently been recorded by Emma Kirkby on a CD of the composer's songs and keyboard works (Columns Musica Oscura, 1995). 19 Modern reprint with introduction by Michael Suarez (London 1996). 20 The first dated source of the music is The London Magazine and Monthly Chronologer (April, 1745), but two single-sheet editions may be earlier, as also is The Agreeable Amusement which is thought to have been published in 1744. John Hoadly's authorship of all the poems listed in this paragraph is acknowledged in a letter of his to Robert Dodsley dated 18 October 1757 (British Library, Add. MS 30262) and reproduced in W.P. Courtney, Dodsley's Collection of Poetry, its contents &amp; contributors: a chapter in the history of English literature in the eighteenth century (privately printed, London, 1910), pp. 102-103. 21 Both John Hoadly and his elder brother Benjamin were educated at Newcome's school in Hackney before going up to Cambridge. 22 These were in response to some verses by the Rev. John Straight of Magdalen College, Oxford, which had been addressed 'To Mr. J. H. at the Temple, [and] occasioned by a Translation of an Epistle of Horace. 1730.' (see pp. 244-248). An 'Answer to the foregoing, 1731.' also by 'J.S.' follows on pp. 251-253. 23 In the first edition, the whole of this Hoadly group appears not in volume three but in volume four which, though dated 1749 on the title-page, was evidently not published until March 1755; see W. P. Courtney, op. cit ., p.3. 24 Courtney, op. cit ., p. 31. Thomas Percy's copy (now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford) is not mentioned by Courtney, but the Walpole copy cited is in the British Library. The Walpole attributions in vols. 1 ,2, and 4 are reproduced in the Bodleian copy of the first edition (Don. f. 17-20). 25 That said, both Thomas Percy and Horace Walpole were among the several literary figures with whom Isaac Reed corresponded (see D.N.B., s.v. 'Reed, Isaac"). I think it unlikely, but it could be, therefore, that the 1782 attribution to Benjamin Hoadly rather than John is based on information received from one or other of these two sources. 26 Unusually for Dodsley, no date is given, but, under the title of 'The Pangs of Forsaken Love', the piece had been published (with the music) in Watts' Musical Miscellany , vi (1731); also in The Merry Musician , iii [1731]. The words only were printed anonymously in the December 1737 issue of The London Magazine .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">George Burrington, Sometime Governor of North Carolina: The "Janus" of Fielding's Champion by Frederick G. Ribble</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fielding's journal the Champion , as W. B. Coley has remarked, is "surrounded by doubtful circumstance." 1 Scholarship has been plagued especially by problems of attribution, problems exacerbated by the incomplete state of the Champion file. The contributions of Fielding and his co-editor and successor James Ralph are far from being completely determined, but much of the difficulty lies in the fact that other contributors have remained so elusive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Champion was published three times a week from 15 November 1739 to c. 31 March 1743. 2 In June 1741, the leaders and some other material from the issues through 19 June 1740 were reprinted in a collected edition. 3 The "Advertisement" to this edition, by James Ralph, lists four authors as especially worthy of mention:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">all the Papers distinguish'd with a C. or an L. are the Work of one Hand ; those mark'd thus * * or sign'd LILBOURNE, of another . . . . The Letters subscrib'd JANUS THE ELDER, are owing to a Third . The Trials of the Coxcombs, Male and Female , as likewise the Dissection of a Head and Heart to a Fourth . And the Remainder to various Correspondents . . . . (A6v)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the eighteenth century, the first two sets of signatures have been known to designate the work of Fielding and Ralph. Recently, "Morpheus," the author of "The Trials of the Coxcombs," has been identified as William Robinson of the Inner Temple (born 1711 or 1712). The identity of Janus the Elder, however, has long been buried in obscurity. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only one letter from Janus the Elder, in fact, occurs in the Champion issues printed in the collected edition, the issues through 19 June 1740. Ralph's mistaken reference to "Letters" is natural, however, considering the importance of this writer to the Champion by June 1741, when the collected edition actually appeared. From 3 June 1740 to 18 February 1741/42, Janus (as he originally called himself) contributed, I shall argue, at least eighteen letters to the journal, including several under his real name. By June 1741, he had begotten a spiritual heir, "Janus the Younger," who himself contributed at least ten shorter pieces, including one in the last extant issue, that of 10 March 1742/43. It is likely, bearing in mind the large gaps in the Champion file, that the total contributed by each writer was substantially greater. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No other contributor to the Champion , perhaps no other Opposition writer, matches Janus in animosity and rancor. He "bites like a viper," as Dr. Johnson said of a contemporary Shakespearean scholar, "and would be glad to leave inflammations and gangrene behind him." 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within a few weeks of his association with the journal, a piece of his was distinguished, in a full-length reply by the chief ministerial paper, the Daily Gazetteer , for its "Personal Scurrility," "Pique," and "Malice." 7 The real crisis in his relations with the ministerial press, however, did not come until 14 November 1741, sixteen months later, when Janus (now writing under the name "Janus the Elder") fell foul on the entire Board of Trade, whom he castigates as incompetent yes-men, "only nominal L[or]ds . . . barely reporting what comes before them" to Robert Walpole and his brother Horatio. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Daily Gazetteer was quick to respond, implying that such remarks were, in reality, treasonable: "He therefore that endeavours to render any Part of the General Plan of Power contemptible, endeavours in some degree to render the Whole so, and in fact to dissolve the People from their Obedience." Hinting at sanctions for such "Licentious Abuse of Liberty," such "Insolence" and "Baseness," the anonymous Gazetteer author casts scorn on the fact that the remarks were published pseudonymously and challenges Janus the Elder to reveal his identity. 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The proprietors of the Champion made a living abusing Walpole, but they may not have wished to take on the Board of Trade in such a direct way. Michael Harris has pointed out that the partners in the Grub - Street Journal took pains, at least on occasion, "that outside contributors of potentially inflammatory material" secured them by a cash indemnity; probably this policy was followed by other journals as well. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whether or not under pressure from the proprietors, Janus the Elder secured the partners in his own manner by taking the heat himself. In a letter to the Champion of 5 December 1741, he acknowledges his contribution of 14 November and accepts the Gazetteer 's challenge by signing his real name, an action which was extraordinary for an Opposition writer of the period. We learn that he is George Burrington, former governor of North Carolina. He is incensed not so much by the Gazetteer 's charges of treason (which he firmly rebuts) as by its insinuations on that "Character of a Gentleman . . . which, I trust, I shall be able always to make good to my dying Day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These insinuations, however, are just the latest of his persecutions at the hands of the administration. He has been provoked "by a Series of Injuries scarce to be paralleled in the most barbarous Government." Or, as he expresses himself in a later paper, speaking specifically of Horatio Walpole: "I hold myself authoriz'd to say, from his Barbarity in my own Case, that he has been guilty of such Acts of Fraud and Injustice, as are scarce to be parallel'd in the English History." 11</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Burrington is an important and interesting figure both as a colonial administrator and as a political writer. And his story certainly contains elements of passion, violence, and even barbarity, whatever the merits of his indictment of the Walpoles. I would like to explore his public career and then consider more specifically the nature and significance of his contributions to the Champion . 12</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington was, in fact, twice governor of North Carolina, first for the Lords Proprietors and later for the Crown. His political prominence has assured him considerable biographical attention. 13 The standard authorities, though, give almost no information about his early life. He is said to have been connected in some way with the family of Gilbert Burrington (fl. 1649-72), of Jewes Hollicomb or Iwes Holycomb, a manor near Crediton, Devon. Speculation about his date of birth is based on one cryptic remark. In a letter of 15 November 1732 to the Duke of Newcastle, Burrington writes: "I have served the crown in every reign since the Abdication of King James" ( CR 3:375), stating, in other words, that he had begun his service at some time before the death of William III in March 1702. He could, therefore, not have been born much after 1687; considering his physical vigor in the 1730's, the inference seems clear that he was not born much before 1684.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A search of Devon parochial records yields more definite information. No George Burrington appears in the International Genealogical Index for the county of Devon or in the parish registers of Crediton and its immediate vicinity, during the period in question. The register of Sampford Courtenay, however, a parish thirteen miles west of Crediton, records the baptism on 14 November 1685 of George, the son of John and Mary Burrington. This George is almost certainly the future colonial governor. 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Burrington was the son and heir of the patriarch Gilbert Burrington mentioned above, from whom he inherited several estates, including land at Sampford Courtenay. As the head of a wealthy family, John was a man of considerable prominence in this part of Devon; from 1694 to 1698, he served in Parliament for Okehampton. 15 George eventually "disobliged" his father, in a foreshadowing of the many violent quarrels he was to have throughout his life. Nevertheless, his position as the son of a local grandee with influence in London explains much about his subsequent political career. 16</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Burrington's earliest public service, undertaken when he was well under twenty, was probably in the army. Having been, presumably, promoted through the ranks, he was commissioned captain in the Queen's Regiment of Horse (1st Dragoon Guards) on 20 March 1713/14. 17 His subsequent army career is obscure, but within nine years, in February 1722/23, he was appointed governor of North Carolina for the Lords Proprietors ( CR 2:480-81). Price has suggested that both Burrington's army commission and his governorship were obtained through the patronage of the Duke of Newcastle ( DNCB ), but, as we learn from Burrington's autobiographical letter in Champion 341, he did not meet Newcastle until the late 1720's. His rise was the result of family influence, although the precise manner in which this influence was exerted is unclear. 18</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is in the detailed records of his governorship for the proprietors that the full piquancy of Burrington's character first emerges. Burrington was inaugurated on 15 January 1723/24. He approached his duties with vigor, especially in his efforts to settle the Lower Cape Fear region, which he was instrumental in turning from a largely inaccessible and unproductive wilderness into an area that was to become, within a few decades, the most fruitful in the colony ( DNCB ).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very early on, however, complaints were raised about his unusual conduct. On 18 April 1724, according to an affidavit by one Robert Forster: "deponent being in the room where the Council satt, Governor Burrington called deponent out and asked him to go in and take Coll West by the nose and he would bring him off but deponent told him he would not take a member of the Council by the Nose in Council for the world" ( CR 3:122-23). 19 A few weeks later, Burrington became involved in a violent altercation with William Badham, Clerk of the Royal Court, and John Lovick, Secretary to the Council. In an affidavit, Badham deposes that the governor fell into a great passion, doubled his fist, held it up, depont expected he would have struck him, and swore with many asservations, he said the Secretary wanted to be Governor, but he would have him in iron before to-morrow night &amp; depont too, and then how like Doggs they would look upon one another, as for the Chief Justice he said he had frighted him out of Town already and would put him in Prison. ( CR 3:122)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This threat ends with a reference to the man Burrington regarded as his chief enemy in the colony, Christopher Gale, Chief Justice of North Carolina and a Collector of Customs. Gale seems to have crossed Burrington in a dispute about customs business early in the year ( CR 2:561) and had already, if Burrington may be believed, been temporarily run out of town. Sometime after the end of August 1724, he fled to England and in January 1724/25 presented a sworn deposition complaining of Burrington's conduct: the said Governor [he writes] at his first arrival. . . which was neare two months before he saw the Depont . . . gave out several menaceing speeches against him saying, he would slitt his nose, crop his ears and lay him in irons, and that agreable to these abusive threats he told the Depont he was his enemy and would ever continue soe. That at the last general Court held by the Depont . . . the said Governor grosely reviled and insulted the said Depont in open Court and then in the execution of his office. . . . And further that early on Sunday evening the 23d of August last The said Governor attempted to break into the Deponts house in Edenton in a violent manner and with intent as he verily believes to murder him, to the very great terror of his family, but finding he could not break open the Door, he broke the window all to pieces, cursing and threatning him in a grievous manner, swearing a great many oaths, that he would lay him by the heels, nay would have him by the throat speedily, and burn his house or blow it up with gunpowder often repeating that this was but the beginning of sorrow to him. ( CR 2:560-61)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gale was a man of considerable probity and reputation; abetted by a "letter of complaint" from the majority of the colonial Council, he succeeded in having Burrington removed from office ( CR 2:559). On 17 July 1725, Sir Richard Everard was sworn in as Burrington's successor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bad blood soon developed between Burrington and Everard. On 15 November 1725, according to a criminal indictment later filed against Burrington: "the sayd George Burrington did openly advisedly and with a malitious &amp; Seditious intent . . . speak . . . these false scandalous opprobious and malitious words that Sr Richard . . . is no more fitt to be Governor . . . than a Hogg in the Woods and that he . . . is a Noodle and an ape."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">According to the same indictment, Burrington, on 2 December 1725, by force and Armes to the terror of his Majestys leige people in the night time with sundry others in a riotous ruffianly manner came to the house of Sr Richd Everard then &amp; still Governor and rudely did violently knock at the door and . . . calling out to Sr Richard declared openly that he . . . was no more fitt to be Governor . . . than Sancha Pancha . . . and then and there opprobiously and in contempt of Governmt called him . . . calves head: And further . . . the sayd George did . . . utter . . . these words Come out you . . . I want satisfaction of you therefore come out and give it to me . . . you are a sorry fellow and I . . . will scalp your damnd thick skull (the said Sr Richard's head meaning and threatning). ( CR 2:648-49) 20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a separate indictment, Burrington is charged with further enormities on the same night: the sayd George Burrington . . . did riotously by force &amp; armes assault Joseph Young[,] Constable breaking open his doors &amp; Windows and him the sayd Joseph . . . he . . . with the Assistance of the others in his Company did . . . Strike batter beat bruise &amp; wound and evilly intreat . . . and also the sayd George Burrington Cornelius Harnett and others . . . did assault James Pottar who came to assist the sayd Joseph in keeping the peace he the sayd James being seizd by the sayd Cornelius and taken by the throat and he the sayd George swearing by the living God he would run him the sayd James Pottar thro' the body with his sword . . . and afterwards the same night they the sayd George Burrington &amp; Cornelius Harnett and others an Assault did make on Thomas Parris . . . &amp; his doors . . . did break open &amp; enter and the sayd George did threaten the sayd Thomas[,] abused his wife &amp; persuaded the sayd Cornelius to beat him. ( CR 2:650-51; bracketed insertions in this and other quotations from this source added by present writer)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two more indictments were filed against Burrington for various assaults and home invasions committed on 4 January and 4 March 1725/26 ( CR 2:649-50 and 651). Burrington was still in North Carolina on 5 April 1726 but had left the colony, apparently, by July 1726 when he failed to appear to answer these and the other two indictments ( CR 2:608, 660). His case was continued several more times and process of outlawry begun against him for non-appearance. Eventually, however, on 3 November 1728, the prosecution against Burrington was dropped. 21</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington had many supporters in North Carolina who dismissed the charges against him as "false &amp; malicious Calumnies . . . raised . . . by Persons of the most Vile Characters as well as Desperate fortunes" ( CR 2:577). He also had powerful friends in England willing to help him salvage his career. Peter King (Lord Chancellor), Arthur Onslow (Speaker of the House of Commons from 1728), Sir William Yonge, "and many other Persons of Honour and Distinction," recommended him to Walpole who had him introduced to the Duke of Newcastle, the Secretary of State for the Southern Department ( Ch 341 [16 Jan. 1741/42] 1/1). In February 1730/31, backed by Walpole and Newcastle, Burrington returned in triumph to North Carolina as the colony's first royal governor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Newcastle, indeed, had a special interest in Burrington's success. "After six years in office," as James A. Henretta points out, "the southern secretary had finally nominated his first colonial governor." This was Newcastle's greatest victory to date in the control of political patronage in the colony. 22</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dissatisfaction with Governor Everard had been great, and Burrington was at first welcomed cordially by the Assembly and populace. As we might expect, though, this spirit of cooperation and amity did not last long. Ninety days had not elapsed [William L. Saunders writes] before he was in open collision, not only with the Lower House of Assembly, representing the people, but with the Chief-Justice, the Attorney-General, the Judge of the Court of Admiralty, the Secretary of the Province and the members of the Council or Upper House, all of whom were appointees and representatives of the Crown. ( CR 3:iv-v)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ill feeling developed quickly between Burrington and Edmund Porter, whom Burrington charged with several irregularities and succeeded in forcing off the Council. In a letter to the Board of Trade, Porter describes one particularly heated confrontation: "the Governor vaunted and sported with my misfortunes . . . and threw a paper which I told him relating to my defence into the fire. . . . the lerned have not described Malice on [ sic ] the furies halfe so terrible to my apprehension as this Gentleman appeared, th he was at the Same time my Judge!" (letter of 19 Feb. 1731/32; CR 3:326).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington was accused of many further acts of intemperance and brutality, including a physical assault on the Attorney General, John Montgomery, in January 1732/33. Montgomery, according to his sworn deposition, had been warned of Burrington's violent animosity and had attempted to avoid him as much as possible. Nevertheless, Burrington burst in upon him one day, "immediately" seized a chair, and aimed two blows at his head: "then the Governor closed with this Deponent and after some struggle got him down and with his knee several times violently punched him on his Belly, and verily believes if some persons had not interposed he the Governour would have used his utmost Endeavour to deprive him of life or to do him some great Injury." Soon afterwards, Montgomery continues, Burrington issued a challenge to "meet and fight him in Virginia" ( CR 3:473-74).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numerous appeals for Burrington's removal were submitted to the Board of Trade, and in March 1733 Gabriel Johnston was appointed the next royal governor. Johnston did not reach the colony, however, until late October 1734. When news of his arrival was published in the capital in November, Burrington's administration ended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington might have resigned his governorship willingly enough; in September 1734, in fact, yielding to the inevitable, he professed himself "very desirous to be rid of my charge" ( CR 3:626; cf. 3:625). He reacted with great bitterness, however, to this peremptory dismissal, which, he contended in a petition to the king (April 1736), had been brought about by slanderous accusations from troublemakers in the colonial government, particularly Chief Justice William Smith, Secretary Nathaniel Rice, and Attorney General John Montgomery, who not satisfyed with the publick opposition they constantly gave your Petitioner in his proceedings did moreover continually use their endeavours to defame him, by inventing and spreading scandalous stories. . . . Your Petitioner . . . desired to obtain a hearing in order to justifye his conduct and actions, that justice was not granted him, but he had the deplorable misfortune to be so misrepresented to Your Majesty as to be removed, without ever knowing the causes that brought upon him an undeserved disgrace &amp; dismal ruine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But these men were not content to destroy his political career. Shortly before his successor arrived, Burrington continues, [Smith, Rice, and Montgomery] with some others their confederates, did contrive and attempt to assassinate your petitioner, then actual Govr there by shooting him with pistoles, from which danger he was rescued by the sudden and unexpected interposition of some courageous men who came to his assistance. Your petitioner believes it was by directions from some persons in England, that Smith, Rice &amp; Montgomery were prompted to murder him, because authentick accounts of that detestable attempt, being transmitted to the Board of Trade, yet their Lordships had no regard to them. ( CR 4:164- 65) Burrington strongly suspected that chief among these "persons in England" was Martin Bladen, a prominent member of the Board itself whom Burrington had angered around 1730 in a dispute over colonial patronage. 23</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As was the case after his dismissal as governor for the proprietors, Burrington had his partisans in the colony. The inhabitants of Bertie and Edgecombe precincts, in an address to Gabriel Johnston, present Burrington as a figure of almost mythic fortitude and benevolence: no man living could have taken more pains &amp; fatigue then he did to acquaint himself with this Province in General which his many Journeys &amp; travels into the back woods on foot will Justifie Sometimes accompanied by one man Only &amp; often pinched with hunger (nay) in danger of Perishing having but one biscutie for three days to subsist on and sometimes Coming amongst the Inhabitts without a Ragg of Cloaths to his back perhaps 200 miles from the place he set out Often carrying with him Considerable Sums of money &amp; disposeing of it amongst many poor people to Encourage &amp; Enable 'em the better to settle the back Lands. ( CR 4:19)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most obvious qualities in Burrington's character as revealed in these documents, however differently he may have appeared to friends and enemies, were energy, impulsiveness, and violence. His vigor is apparent not only in his considerable exertions in opening up the back country but also in the care and thoroughness of the reports about population, geography, and commerce which he submitted to the Board of Trade. He states, probably with only a little exaggeration, that at one period he "generally was confined to my pen twenty hours in every day and night" ( CR 3:335). The darker side of his nature came out, however, in riots of abusive and brutal behavior, which could not have been entirely a fabrication of his enemies (questionable as the character of some of these enemies may have been). As Saunders writes, "if a tithe of what was sworn to as to his violence, both in speech and action, be true, the wonder is that he got away from the colony alive, and not that a conspiracy was formed to kill him, as he alleged" ( CR 2:ix).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By 13 June 1735, Burrington was back in England seeking redress for his numerous grievances, among which was a refusal by the government to pay his salary and official expenses. In his petition to the king cited above, he complains feelingly of his resulting financial hardships: the Petitioner receiving no part of his salary was necessitated to give premiums and borrow large sums of money upon interest, to defray his expenses; all which sums at this time remain unpaid, to the great impoverishment of the Petitioner, who has now due to him the salary for four years &amp; seven months.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Petitioner was commanded by one of the royal Instructions, to cause perfect surveys to be made, and drafts drawn, of the ports, and harbours in North Carolina . . . which proved very difficult, tedious and expensive, yet was compleatly effected, and perfectly finished by the diligence &amp; at the expence of the Petitioner, who has not hitherto received any reward, nor even reimbursement. ( CR 4:164) 24</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While presenting his complaints to various authorities, Burrington tried to make himself useful to the Board of Trade as a consultant on North Carolina affairs. 25 In particular, he pushed energetically for a scheme to settle "six thousand Protestant Switz Families" on 3,000,000 acres in a remote region of the colony. 26 His efforts in this and other matters, however, involved him in a violent row with Governor Johnston, who became especially incensed at a memorial of Burrington's criticizing his handling of land patents. In a letter to the Board, though, Johnston consoled himself with the knowledge that Burrington was obviously no respecter of rank or dignity: "as I find that Gentleman has upon another occasion made at least equally free with the Lords of Trade themselves I think I have no occasion to complain" ( CR 4:266).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After attending tediously at the Board for several months, Burrington had the mortification to learn that the commissioners had honored instead a proposal for settling the colony put forth by Henry McCulloh, "a little Irish Dealer in Linnens," as Burrington characterizes him in Champion 349 (1/2). 27 His petition to the king for redress of the many indignities done him was curtly rejected, furthermore, in May 1736, as "very irregular," probably because of the ill-considered charge that the assassination attempt had been masterminded from England ( CR 4:168-69; 3:x-xi).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Swallowing his other complaints, Burrington applied to Walpole for his back pay and expenses. He was referred to Horatio Walpole "in his Capacity of Viceroy General of the P[lantatio]ns," "who, on my first Approach to his Greatness, treated me with an Insolence beyond Example, in order, I presume, to rid himself of any farther Trouble." Applying once again to Robert Walpole he was "not suffer[ed] . . . to open my Mouth" and contemptuously dismissed. 28</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington was still able to fall back on his army connections. In early 1740, after the outbreak of war with Spain, he offered his services to the expedition forming to attack Cartagena and other Spanish possessions in America. George II, however, left for Hanover without signing his commission, and it was vetoed by the commanders of the expedition, acting, Burrington suspected, on the instructions of his enemies in government ( Ch 341 1/3).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dismissed from his governorship without a hearing, almost murdered (in his opinion), denied his salary and even his out-of-pocket expenses, thwarted in his pet scheme to settle the Swiss Protestants, refused a chance to serve in the American expedition, and withal a man who could accurately describe himself as "Warm . . . by Disposition," 29 Burrington was ready to wreak himself on the Establishment. By the end of May 1740, little over a week after his commission was doomed by the king's departure for Hanover, he had thrown in his lot with Fielding and Ralph as a contributor to the Champion .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the point when Burrington joined the Champion , the journal's attack on Walpole was just beginning to become much nastier and more intense. Fielding contributed to this politicization, most notably in his leader of 31 May 1740, with its obscene print of a place-seeker applying himself "to the vilest Part of the vilest Trunk ." 30 Essentially, however, his influence worked in the other direction: toward a less partisan, more humanistic paper in the tradition of the Spectator .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In June 1740, Fielding began his career as a barrister. As he prepared to abandon some of his editorial responsibilities to Ralph, he wrote a statement about the direction he felt the paper should take, a statement aimed as much at Ralph as anyone else: "our Readers are to regard [Politicks], as their Physic not their Food; and they may be assured Dr. Lilbourne will dose them as often as it is requisite, it being his Intention sufficiently to work their GUTS" ( Ch 91 [12 June] 2/1; with a pun on "Guts," one of the Opposition's nicknames for Walpole). 31</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Satire of Walpole might well be savage but it was not to swamp the literary character of the journal. In the summer of 1740, however, Ralph treated politics more and more as his readers' "Food" and not merely their "Physic." His chief ally in his assault on the Establishment, in working the people's "Guts," was Burrington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's first contribution is announced on 31 May 1740 with more than usual fanfare: "In our next will be a Petition from the City of London . . . for which we heartily thank the Author, and do assure him we shall strictly pursue all he requests" ( Ch 86 2/1).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This essay, which appeared on 3 June, was unsigned (although it was given the signature "Janus the Elder" when reprinted in the collected edition a year later). It is written in a clipped commercial dialect and is supposed to emanate from a Citizen of London, a persona Burrington did not attempt again. The "Petition" proper which ends the essay involves a ghastly abasement to Walpole as "the Power ABOVE": We will henceforth, on all Occasions, not only behave ourselves as Loyal Subjects to our King, but as your Creatures. . . . Whatever Impositions you shall please to lay on us either for our Good, or as a Punishment of our Offences, shall be readily and cheerfully paid . . . not doubting but that . . . you will be graciously pleased not to deprive us of that little Trade we have left, but to let it continue, that ourselves, our Wives, and Children may eat and live. ( Ch 87 2/1)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With its rather ambitious use of dialect and parody, this essay has a literary quality, a Fieldingesque indirection, absent from many of Burrington's subsequent contributions. There is evidence, in fact, that Fielding admired it. His "Creed of a Hum-clumist," a similar religious litany published a few weeks later in the Champion of 28 June, is quite possibly modeled on Burrington's "Petition." He alludes to the essay explicitly, moreover, in Champion 105 (15 July), where Walpole is described as "the POWER ABOVE" (1/1) whose deeds Janus will disclose to the world, as the Latin epigraph informs us: "----- Tute ipse fatebere , JANE, / Et dices orbi attonito ; nil saecula tale / Prima tulere Hominum , nîl majus Postera reddent " ("You will confess, Janus, and speak to an astonished world that the first ages of men have seen no such thing and future ages will see nothing greater"). 32</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his next contribution, published on 26 June 1740 (and thus falling outside the period covered in the collected edition), Burrington undertakes to defend Walpole's skill and "Capacity" (1/3). He argues eloquently that since the minister, as a thorough-going scoundrel, intends the extraordinary mischief he causes, the charges made by malcontents that he is "a Novice, or Blunderer" (1/1) must be baseless. The essay is signed "Janus," the first use of this pseudonym in the Champion .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two-faced figure of "Janus" ( Janus bifrons ) has a rich intellectual and iconographic history, being associated with, inter alia , the ideas of prudence, irony, propitious beginnings, guardianship, and proclamations of war and peace. Burrington seems to have drawn on several of these meanings in his use of the pseudonym.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As George Wither explains, in his Collection of Emblemes (1634), the two faces of Janus represent the wise man:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">we may apply This double-face , that man to signifie, Who (whatsoere he undertakes to doe) Lookes, both before him, and behinde him, too. For, he shall never fruitfully forecast Affaires to come , who mindes not what is past . 33</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As "Janus," Burrington is a man of prudence, of practical experience, who can speak intelligently about the present and future because of his knowledge of the past. In these Champion essays, he presents, as he wrote later in reference to another work, "what I have observed of the Pass'd, and . . . what may thence be gathered for the Benefit of the Present and the Future." 34</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's pseudonym probably alludes also to the repetitive, "two-faced" irony of his essays. Ralph uses the word "Janus" in the sense of "two-faced" at Champion 59 (29 Mar. 1740) 2/2 ("More Sermons of the Janus - kind , with the Face of Charity in Front, and that of Policy behind") and Champion 75 (6 May 1740) 3/3 ("a Janus- Piece of Politicks"). Since Burrington advocated a vigorous prosecution of the war against Spain, he may intend as well a reference to the Roman ceremony of opening the gates of Janus, the traditional symbol of declaring war (see Ralph's comment at Champion 84 [27 May 1740] 3/2: "Whence we are to conclude, that Janus open'd his Gate, only to shut it again").</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four other "Janus" papers appeared in the summer of 1740: on 3 July, 19 July, 14 August, and 21 August. 35 In them, Burrington turned to a more technical and detailed account of the economic condition of England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's experience as governor had given him a training in political economy few journalists could match. His careful investigations of the geography, manufactures, and trade of North Carolina had produced a wealth of practical knowledge, and, in his laborious reports to the Board of Trade, he had learned to marshall complex arguments in a coherent form. In his public capacity, these qualities had, indeed, been vitiated by an almost uncontrollable propensity to vitriolic, abusive language, but as a journalist he was able to draw on his talent for vilification to great advantage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much of Burrington's discussion in these papers is taken up with detailed suggestions for tariff reform. But he does go beyond this mercantilist emphasis on regulation to a broader program of economic regeneration. At least two of his proposals are decidedly progressive. He supports a national enclosure act, with the explicit proviso, however, that it should be implemented "on such Terms . . . that the Poor, should be Gainers by the Alteration." And he emphasizes especially the importance of water navigation to the economy (a major concern of his while governor of North Carolina), even endorsing conditionally two early canal schemes. 36</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not surprisingly, Walpole cuts a sorry figure in Burrington's account, as a man perfectly able to see the wholesomeness of these suggestions, but prevented from implementing them by greed, lack of concern for the people, and subservience to foreign states.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since its inception in mid-November 1739, the Champion had attracted almost no notice from Walpole's journal the Daily Gazetteer . 37 Even Fielding's scatological leader of 31 May 1740 had met with silence and neglect. Ralph's summer campaign against Walpole, however, in which Burrington played so notable a part, greatly provoked the ministerial writers. In an attack of 4 July on another Opposition journal, the Gazetteer breaks out in its strongest condemnation of the Champion to date: "I dare say, such a Rhapsody of Fury and Nonsense and Billingsgate never appeared in Print before, not even in the Champion itself, which is the very Quintessence of this Kind of Style and Dialect" ( DG 1573 1/3). On 24 July, it goes even further: of all the Years that have passed since this unnatural Scheme was first set on Foot [of stirring up the people against the Constitution and government], 'tis evident, that the present has been most fruitful in barefac'd Scandal, Sedition, and Nonsense: And of all the Scribbling Insects that nibble at the Root of the Nation's Repose and Happiness this Season, I think the two Mushroom Writers lately sprung up of the Papers call'd the Champion and Englishman's Evening Post , the most incorrigible, crude, and inconsistent. ( DG 1590 1/1)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The writer of this last outburst probably had Janus's paper of 19 July very much in mind. On 29 July, the Gazetteer was to devote an entire leader to this paper, indignantly deploring its "Personal Scurrility" and "Malice" ( DG 1594 1/1-3). Such prominent notice was a great distinction for an occasional contributor to the Opposition press. The obvious exasperation of the minister's defenders must have provided a measure of revenge for the indignities Burrington felt had been heaped upon him and which had called forth his pen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No "Janus" papers were published in the Champion from 23 August through 15 November 1740. 38 After 15 November, the file of the journal becomes very defective; there are only eight issues known to be extant (in whole or in part) at any location between this date and 1 October 1741. One of these issues, however, Champion 232 (7 May 1741), does include a "Janus" letter. Burrington notes, in this essay, that Pliny the Younger raised his own reputation by his just panegyrics on "the heroic and civil Virtues of Trajan ." Just so, Janus will tie his reputation to the character he paints of Walpole, of whom he envisages a different "Monument": Ye greatly-minded, when ye lay the Plan of Gardens . . . forget not to reserve a Place, remote from Sight, on which to raise, of useless and offensive Rubbish, a Dunghill, a Monument to the Villany and Rapine of the Shame of Knighthood: Plant Nettles round, plant Thistles and the baneful Hemlock, and there bid Mandragora arise; and at a Distance, pointing to the filthy Place, say, so odious, so horrid, is the Remembrance of the treacherous Dead, so stinking is the Memory of departed Villains. (1/2)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By 25 June 1741, when the collected edition of the Champion appeared, Janus had been bumped up a generation and renamed "Janus the Elder." The presumption, then, is that "Janus the Younger" first contributed to the journal under this pseudonym sometime between 7 May and around 20 June. Although Janus the Younger contributed at least one further letter in 1741 (and probably several more), no paper with this pseudonym is extant before 2 March 1741/42. We shall return to this author later in our narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From 1 October 1741 through 31 August 1742, the file of the Champion is about three-fourths complete. The first part of this period, through mid-February, was the most fruitful in Burrington's career as a contributor to the journal. On 24 October 1741, he began his account of the British colonies in North America, an account continued anonymously in the issue of 3 November 1741 and resumed under his own name in January 1741/42.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's observations are knowledgeable and carefully detailed: [The New England colonies] abound in Cyder, Lumber, Staves, Boards, Ship- Masts, Skins, Furs, &amp;c. Their Horses are likewise the best in America ; and with these they supply both the English and French Sugar Islands, and likewise our Settlements on the Continent. The Inhabitants on the Sea Coast are dexterous Fishermen, and take Abundance of Cod during the Season, which are vended at the same Markets with those of Newfoundland . ( Ch 305 [24 Oct. 1741] 1/2-3)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seen in the light of later events, his comments sometimes have a particular resonance: "the principal Strength of Boston consists in the Numbers, Wealth, Sense, and Bravery of its Inhabitants: Hence it is . . . that their Liberties, of which they are justly tenacious, are secure from the Designs of false Friends, and their Frontier from the Attempts of open Enemies." It is because of their stubborn defense of liberty, he adds, that these "refractory Provinces" of New England, have "so long laboured under the Displeasure of his Honour " and that "so many Acts of P[arliamen]t have been made to the Detriment of their Trade" ( Ch 309 [3 Nov. 1741] 1/1).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the first few months of its existence, the Champion gave very little attention to America, except when reporting Admiral Vernon's military exploits (Speer, p. 48n). Burrington, however, strongly believed in the importance of the colonies. As he points out in an essay appended to Seasonable Considerations : "Our Plantations are alone sufficient to preserve us a rich, happy and flourishing People, if proper Care was taken to make the most of them" (p. 52). His series on America was a valuable contribution to British journalism and was highly esteemed by the Champion 's readers. 39</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's next contribution, after his American papers of 24 October and 3 November, was his fateful letter of 14 November 1741 on Walpole and the Board of Trade, signed "Janus the Elder." This letter, as noted earlier, resulted in a confrontation with the Daily Gazetteer and Burrington's own revelation of his identity, in the Champion of 5 December.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To someone of Burrington's temper the limitations imposed by anonymity or pseudonymity must never have been completely satisfactory. From this time, he could tell his story directly to the public, backing up invective with detailed personal experience. In the Champion of 5 December, he speaks of his "almost twenty Years Attendance on the B[oard] of T[rade]" and of their nearly unbelievable indolence and malfeasance, as revealed most strikingly in their correspondence with him during his governorship of North Carolina. This correspondence, which he threatens soon to deliver to John Huggonson's shop for publication, will thoroughly expose the incompetence of the Board ( Ch 323 1/1-2). In fact, these papers seem never to have been published. 40 Burrington's fullest vent was to come in the next two months in the Champion itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In January and February 1741/42, Burrington contributed essays on a variety of subjects. There is a biographical paper on Sir Charles Wills (1666-1741), as well as three more installments of the series on the American colonies (issue of 7 January; and issues of 30 January, 4 February, and 11 February). But the most interesting of these essays, the papers in which Burrington proclaimed most exhaustively his grievances against the Establishment, are his open letter to Walpole in Champion 341 (16 January) and his two-part "Charge against his Late Honour" in Champion 354-55 (16 and 18 February).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's letter of 16 January is the most important single document for his biography and has been drawn on frequently in the present account. His aim is to authenticate the details of the "ill Usage" he has endured so that "those already acquainted with my Story, may no longer deem it incredible." Burrington traces the beginning of his troubles to his quarrel around 1730 with Martin Bladen, Walpole's "Toad Eater in ordinary." As a result of the machinations of Bladen and others, he was laid under a "ministerial Excommunication" which blasted his future political career and lay behind the series of disappointments and grievances described above. 41</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Bladen was the occasion, Walpole is the true cause of Burrington's afflictions: "To conclude, Sir, in Defiance of Justice and Goodness, you have oppress'd and ruin'd me, and, exasperated with so many Wrongs, I ever have and ever shall treat both you and your Brother, according to your transcendent Merits. A poor Consolation . . . but at present, the only one in [my] Power" (2/1).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington's phrase "at present" was more menacing than might at first appear. In mid- January 1741/42, when this letter was published, Walpole was desperately clinging to a slim majority in the House of Commons. It became increasingly obvious that he could no longer manage the House, and in February he resigned his posts as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Walpole's enemies saw their chance to send him to the Tower. As the author of an article in the "Home News" section of the Champion excitedly remarked: "It is now given out, with many probable Circumstances, that the Wishes of the People are like to be accomplish'd , in a general and effectual Prosecution both of the Grand Criminal and his Accomplices " ( Ch 354 [16 Feb. 1741/42] 2/1).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his "Charge against his Late Honour, in Behalf of the People," published on 16 and 18 February, after Walpole's fall, Burrington becomes the (self-)appointed champion of the people, clothed with their authority and true majesty. 42 The villainies and incompetencies of Walpole are fully canvassed, not least of which is his dependence on the diplomatic skills of his brother Horatio: With regard to the Conduct of our foreign Affairs, we found his Booby- B[rothe]r disgracing the whole Nation, by burlesquing the Character of an A[mbassado]r at the principal Courts of Europe ; we found all Treaties negociated, and all Alliances made under the same contemptible Direction; and, as if to keep him in Countenance, we saw other Persons yet more contemptible, if possible, dragg'd from Obscurity, entrusted to be Plenipos, and granting away the Power, Property, and Honour of the K[ing] and Kingdom. ( Ch 355 [18 Feb. 1741/42] 1/1)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The burden of the "Charge," or rather the verdict of the people through their representative Burrington, is that Walpole's actions "ought to be understood and represented as High-Treason against [the Constitution]: High-Treason not only imagin'd, but proved by many Overt-Acts, in the Face of the whole Nation; therefore justly liable to the Censures, I might say, to the Vengeance of the Legislature" ( Ch 354 [16 Feb.] 1/3). 43</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since his first contribution to the Champion in June 1740, Burrington had sought to articulate his outrage at the wrongs Walpole had done him, working through irony, bold-faced invective, and tendentious analyses of the state of the nation. Now in this final revenge or revenge-fantasy, his voice, having become that of the people, decrees and certifies that "Vengeance" proper for such "inveterate Malice" (as he characterizes it in Ch 341 1/3). The "Charge" is the climax of Burrington's campaign against Walpole and his "Drudges, Tools, and Slaves" ( Ch 354 1/2), and it is fitting that it is his last known contribution to the journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By an odd coincidence, the first extant Janus the Younger letter, in the Champion of 2 March 1741/42, appeared within two weeks of this valedictory effort (as it may be) by Burrington/Janus the Elder, as if the mantle really had passed from one writer to the other. It is virtually certain, however, that Janus the Younger contributed to the Champion at least as early as June 1741, and he tells us himself that some verses of his appeared in the journal in July of that year. 44</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Janus the Younger is a man of well-developed literary and cultural sensibilities, a man of a very different temper from Burrington. Although he sometimes writes on politics, his letters to the Champion cover a much broader range of subjects, from the description of a comet to a celebration of the delights of Handel's music.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The connection this writer is claiming with Janus (or Janus the Elder) is almost certainly not biological but spiritual. 45 Considering the facetious way contributors to the Champion adapted other writers' personae, however, such a kinship need not have run very deep. Lacking the first essay under this pseudonym, we can only speculate about what this connection is, but we may find a clue in Burrington's letter to the Champion of 7 May 1741, quite probably the last Janus essay before Janus the Younger's first contribution. In this letter, it will be remembered, Burrington/Janus associates himself closely with Pliny the Younger. It is possible that Janus the Younger's name is a humorous adaptation of Pliny's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Janus the Younger seems not to have published any separate works under this pseudonym, 46 but a few clues to his identity can be found in the Champion itself. He is a minor poet and an essayist of some ability. He contributes an "Ode on the Death of Robert [Eighth] Lord Petre," a man whom he calls his friend and who was presumably also his patron; in fact, he seems familiar with the Petre family and mentions particularly Petre's wife and infant son, "little more than half a Year old" ( Ch 413 [8 July 1742]). Twice he contributes short lyrics on Vauxhall Gardens ( Ch of c. 30 July 1741 and Ch 422 [31 July 1742]). He was a good friend of Jonathan Tyers, the "Master" of Vauxhall Gardens, and defends him heatedly, in this last Champion , against some unspecified slander.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A very good case can be made, I believe, for Thomas "Hesiod" Cooke (1703-56) as the writer of the Janus the Younger papers. Cooke, a close friend of both Fielding and Ralph, seems to have had some inside connection with the Champion , both in its earliest stages and as late as April 1742, when an extract from the new edition of his poetry is prominently featured on the front page. 47 Cooke's edition of Virgil (London, 1741) is dedicated to the 8th Lord Petre. Around the end of 1744, he corresponded with Petre's friend Peter Collinson about editing some verses on Petre for submission to the magazines. 48 In the "Preface" to his edition and translation of Plautus, Cooke writes that Petre "has a Claim to both my Gratitude and my Sorrow; and I never think of him without paying both to his Memory." Cooke was also, as his biographer Sir Joseph Mawbey notes, a close friend of Tyers and wrote "several songs" for Vauxhall Gardens. 49</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unfortunately, Janus the Younger's extant verse contributions to the Champion would have had little further chance of being acknowledged as Cooke's. The last collected edition of his poetry was published in April 1742, several months before either of these occasional poems appeared in the journal, several months, in fact, before Petre's death, on 2 July 1742. 50 Cooke could not, then, have included an elegy on Petre in this edition, but he did commemorate the latest important event in the Petre family in an "Ode. . . . To the Honourable Master Robert Petre a Day Old," that infant whose age Janus the Younger mentioned with some precision when introducing his ode. 51</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We may conclude, then, that the identification of Janus the Younger with Cooke is very probable, although not definitely established.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The accompanying table will serve to draw together our discussion of Janus/Burrington and Janus the Younger and to indicate, in an abbreviated way, the extent of their known contributions to the Champion . The first four columns give the number of the original Champion issue (inferred for 11 November 1742), the date, the signature of the essay (with Burrington's pseudonyms followed by the abbreviation "Bur"), and the library or libraries holding the original (O=Bodleian, NN=New York Public Library, L=British Library). The fifth column notes whether or not the issue is included in the microfilm series Early English Newspapers (EEN). Table comparing contributions of Janus/Barrington and Janus the Younger to the Champion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few details are known about Burrington's life in the years after his retirement from the Champion . He did publish two political tracts in this period, both under his own name: Seasonable Considerations on the Expediency of a War with France (April 1743) and An Answer to Dr . William Brakenridge's Letter concerning the Number of Inhabitants , within the London Bills of Mortality (April 1757). 52 The first of these works, a plea for the use of naval power against French trade and overseas possessions, has been called "perhaps the most interesting example" of the new agitation in the contemporary press for a more assertive commercial policy toward France (Robert Harris, Patriot Press , 145). The same expansive, patriotic attitude to England's power and prestige lies behind the rather dry debate about population figures in An Answer . Brakenridge's argument that London, in his words, "is past its Heighth, and is rather upon the Decline" is patently false, Burrington contends, but even were it true it would be a shameful confession of the "consumptive" state of the nation, lessening it in "the Opinion of our Neighbours" ( Answer , 17, 2).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Considering the violence of Burrington's character, his death has a certain tragic propriety. In February 1759, while walking in St. James's Park, he was robbed and murdered. The Public Advertiser for 23 February 1759 prints the following news item: "Yesterday was taken out of the Canal in St. James's Park, the Body of an elderly Man well dressed. His Pockets were turn'd inside out, and his Stick in his Hand, which was clinched and bruised." This man is soon identified as Burrington ( London Evening- Post , 24/27 February). He must have seemed a grim and formidable presence as he was taken out of the canal, his bruised hand, even in death, still clinched around his cane. Probably the old man had put up a much fiercer struggle than his attacker had expected. 53</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Burrington was buried at St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, on 24 February. He appears in the Burial Fee Book as the "Hon: George Burrington" and his funeral was an expensive one, with fees for minister, sexton, pall, parson, and knell (among other items). 54 This was a funeral which fully preserved that "Character of a Gentleman" which Burrington had assured the world he would "make good to my dying Day." 55</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After Fielding and Ralph, Burrington was the most important contributor to the Champion , yet his connection with the paper has been virtually unknown to modern scholarship. By a fortunate accident (fortunate for our purposes), Burrington was not only a journalist but also a prominent political figure. There is, therefore, a rich account, preserved in state papers and court records, of his actions and character for certain important periods of his life. Burrington's remarkable paranoia and quickness of temper, revealed most characteristically in riot and criminal assault, make this account all the richer and more highly flavored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sense of the bitter wrongs, real and imaginary, done him by the Walpoles and the Board of Trade festered in Burrington's mind and forced him to seek a vent in the Champion . In many ways, Burrington helped transform the journal from a literary, humanistic paper to one of a soberer, more narrowly political cast. Still, his contributions are often knowledgeable and astute, especially his papers on British manufacturing and commerce and his series on America. Most importantly for the proprietors, he provided vigorous and unflinching leadership in the campaign against Walpole. By temperament and by training in the frontier politics of North Carolina, Burrington was superbly qualified to mete out that rough justice which, according to the Champion and its partisans, the Prime Minister, that "Grand Criminal," so richly deserved.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">2 According to documents filed in a Chancery suit, the journal was discontinued on 31 March 1743 (Martin C. with Ruthe R. Battestin, Henry Fielding : A Life [London: Routledge, 1989], 653 n. 5; citing Public Record Office: C.11.2155/7). It is not clear whether or not an issue was actually published on 31 March; the last extant issue, at the Bodleian, is for 10 March 1742/43. Around 2 April 1743, appeared the first issue of a sequel: The British Champion ; or , The Impartial Advertiser . See J. B. Shipley, "On the Date of the 'Champion,'" Notes and Queries 198 (1953): 441; and Michael Harris, "Literature and Commerce in Eighteenth-Century London: The Making of The Champion ," Prose Studies 16 (1993): 94-115, pp. 108-109 cited. Unless otherwise noted, quotations in this article are from the original issues. The file of extant original issues can be summarized as follows (omitting a few stray issues if found in longer runs elsewhere): 29 Dec. 1739-15 Nov. 1740 (virtually complete run at Bodleian), 18 Nov. 1740-29 Sep. 1741 (eight issues, two of which lack second leaf; scattered at various locations), 1 Oct. 1741-31 Aug. 1742 (good run, about three-fourths complete, at British Library), 2 Sep. 1742-31 Mar. 1743 (two issues, for 11 Nov. 1742 and 10 Mar. 1742/43, at New York Public Library and Bodleian, respectively). Some material from issues no longer extant was reprinted in the collected edition mentioned below and in other newspapers, notably the York Courant ; and some material was excerpted in the History of Our Own Times , the Gentleman's Magazine , and the Scots Magazine . The British Library run from 1 Oct. 1741-31 Aug. 1742 is included in Early English Newspapers (New Haven, Conn.: Research Publications, 1978-), microfilm, reel 780.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 The Champion (London: J. Huggonson, 1741), 2 vols. Published 25 June 1741 ( Daily Gazetteer ; cited Battestins, Henry Fielding , 691). The similarity of dates makes it easy to forget that this reprint was published about a year after the latest original issue included.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 From as early as December 1739, Fielding was known to be the chief writer of the Champion (i.e., the "C" and "L" of the "Advertisement"); see the Daily Gazetteer of 22 December 1739 (and cf. issues for 24 and 30 July 1740). Ralph clearly reveals himself to be "Lilbourne" in a letter published in Champion 131 (13 Sep. 1740). These identifications, however, seem not to have entered the broader critical discussion of the Champion until Nathan Drake's use of them in his Essays , Biographical , Critical , and Historical , Illustrative of the Rambler , [etc.] (London, 1809-10), 1:85, 90-91. For the identification of "Morpheus," see Frederick G. Ribble, "William Robinson, Contributor to Fielding's Champion ," Studies in Bibliography 43 (1990): 182-89.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 Of the extant contributions by Janus/Janus the Elder, seven occur before June 1741, the last date known for Fielding's active participation in the Champion , whether as writer or shareholder. All eighteen fall before 1 March 1741/42, when, in what G. M. Godden calls Fielding's "final severance" from the journal, his proprietary shares were transferred to Ralph. See Henry Fielding : A Memoir (London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co., 1910), 115-16 and 138- 39. All of Janus the Younger's extant contributions occur after 1 March 1741/42, although there is evidence he contributed at least two essays before this date.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">12 As far as I know, Burrington's authorship of the Janus/Janus the Elder papers in the Champion has not been noted in any published source since 1741. The case for identifying Burrington with Janus the Elder is made briefly, as I discovered during the latter part of my research for this article, in an unpublished 1951 dissertation by John Forbes Speer: "A Critical Study of the Champion " (Univ. of Chicago); see 42n, 49, 224. Speer argues, though, at 42n (a note which seems initially to be making the opposite point), that Janus is probably a different writer. In 1741-42, Burrington contributed five papers on America to the Champion , the first two anonymously and the last three under his own name. Robert Harris refers to this series in passing but is unaware of Burrington's connection with Janus/Janus the Elder ( A Patriot Press : National Politics and the London Press in the 1740's [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993], 145 and n).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">13 The best biography of Burrington is still the short monograph by Marshall DeLancey Haywood, Governor George Burrington (Raleigh, N.C., 1896); Haywood also contributed the article on Burrington in the Dictionary of American Biography , ed. Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1928-36). See also Blackwell P.

William S. Powell (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1979-) (hereafter abbreviated as DNCB ). By far the richest source for Burrington's political career is The Colonial Records of North Carolina [First Series], collected and ed. William L.

      <field name="fulltext">16 In his will dated 20 June 1717 and proved 27 June 1718, John Burrington states that "all my children have disobliged me." Although he provides for payment of debts incurred "jointly with my son George," he gives his property to his nephew Thomas Burrington (will no longer extant; abstract by Sir Oswyn Murray in Westcountry Studies Library, Exeter, O.M. Coll 8/36). Modern historians sometimes give the name of George's father as Gilbert (see Haywood, Governor George Burrington , p. 6; followed by Price, DNCB ). This statement, based ultimately on information provided by a Burrington family member around 1895, almost certainly involves a confusion between the patriarchal grandfather Gilbert and the father John. James Ralph seems to have believed that Charles Burrington, one of John's younger brothers, was George's father. Charles was a cornet who joined the Prince of Orange's army soon after its landing. In his History of England , Ralph exaggerates Charles's role in the Revolution and assimilates his description of Charles (whom he knows simply as "Major Burrington") to Burrington's description of his father in Ch 341 (16 Jan. 1741/42). Charles, however, died a bachelor (letters of administration, PRO, Prerogative Court of Canterbury [Oct. 1702]). See Ralph, History (London, 1744-46) 1:1038; Narcissus Luttrell, A Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs (1857; reprint, Hampshire, England: Gregg International Publishers, 1969), 1:477; T. W.

For the commission itself, see PRO, State Papers 44/173, pp. 392-393. Price is erroneous in stating that Burrington's commission was granted in 1715 ("A Strange Incident," 150; DNCB ).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18 Although by 1717 George's relations with his father were strained (see note 16 above), he still benefited from his father's political connections. Surety for George's commission, in the amount of £1,000, was given by Nicolas Vincent, of Truro, Cornwall, and by Denis Bond (1676-1747), later notorious for his fraudulent purchase of the Derwentwater estates and for looting the Charitable Corporation ( CR 2:480-81). It is not clear, however, whether these men were Burrington's patrons or merely acting as financial brokers. In the late 1720's, he was supported in his bid for the royal governorship by Peter King, Arthur Onslow, and Sir William Yonge, among others (see text below).</field>

According to Burrington's petition, the government owed him over £3200 in back pay alone; he seems to have received only £200 of this amount. See Jack P. Greene, The Quest for Power : The Lower Houses of Assembly in the Southern Royal Colonies , 1689-1776 (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1963), 142; and [Great Britain.

Burrington's association with North Carolina, however, was hardly a financial disaster. In February 1737/38, around three years after his return to England, his country "Seat" in North Carolina is advertised as comprising 29,225 acres of "fine, convenient Land" (sale notice in the Virginia Gazette of 3/10 February).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">25 Before he left for England, Burrington had written Newcastle that "the affairs of this Province will prove difficult to the Lords of Trade without my assistance" (letter of 17 Sep. 1734; CR 3:626). He attended meetings at the Board at least from 13 June 1735 to 26 October 1736 ( Journal of the Commissioners , 7 [for 1735-41]: 25, 31-32, 67, 69, 88, 97, and 136).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">42 Burrington's "Charge" naturally calls to mind the notorious "Remarkable Queries" (first published in Ch 141 for 7 Oct. 1740), in which the political struggle with Walpole is rendered as a "Tryal between the whole Nation Plaintiff , and one single Man Defendant ." Burrington is certainly a leading candidate for the authorship of this unusually forthright, hard-hitting attack. Neither the "Queries," however, nor the tract Plain Truth (London, 1741), which advertises itself as "by the Author of the Remarkable Queries " (title page), yields any personal details helpful for an attribution to Burrington or, indeed, to anyone else.</field>

Clutton treats the ode and accompanying letter in isolation without considering other Janus the Younger contributions to the Champion . He notes that Cooke told Collinson about the Virgil dedication and his intended compliments in the forthcoming Plautus edition but concludes, fallaciously I believe, that Cooke may be rejected as the author of the ode "since otherwise he must surely have mentioned it along with his other two tributes" (61 n. 16). Clutton suggests the ode may have been written by Collinson or by Philip or Edward Southcote. These men were all close friends of Petre's, but there is no further evidence that might connect them with Janus the Younger.

      <field name="heading_text">The Authorship of Smollett's Don Quixote by Martin C. Battestin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the two hundred years from its publication in 1755 to the appearance of Carmine Rocco Linsalata's monograph Smollett's Hoax in 1956, the version of Cervantes' Don Quixote that bears Smollett's name was the target of more damaging, not to say malignant, criticism than he could have bargained for--more, certainly, than the work deserves. 1 And nothing has been done in the past forty years to rescue Smollett's reputation, in this instance, from a formidable battery of charges ranging from plain ignorance to deceit and plagiarism. As a consequence of this criticism, for example, no less an authority than the British Library Catalogue (1975) prefaces the section on Smollett's translations with a caveat casting doubt on his authorship of the work. 2 Yet Smollett scholars have continued to deal with the problem not (as good therapists would advise) by talking about it, but by ignoring it: without a cautionary word, the work remains in all the standard sources simply "Smollett's translation." 3 Three days after the work was published on 25 February 1755, the attacks began in earnest with an anonymous pamphlet entitled, Remarks on the Proposals lately published for a new translation of Don Quixote --the author, Colonel William Windham, basing his criticism on the specimen (consisting of the first Chapter) that Smollett had published a year earlier as a lure to subscribers. To Windham, the specimen plainly revealed Smollett's ignorance of the Spanish language and Spanish customs, as well as his "unpardonable" (p. 10) negligence in ignoring the two principal "helps" available to him: namely, the Royal "Madrid" Dictionary 4 and Charles Jarvis's more exact translation (1742). After heaping scorn on Smollett's rendering of the phrase "duelos y quebrantos" (the meal Don Quixote eats on Saturdays) as "gripes and grumblings" and the long, arch footnote in which Smollett burlesques the pedantry of previous translators who had struggled to find an English equivalent for the expression, Windham compares Smollett's understanding of the original to that of a Frenchman who would render "a Welch rabbet" as "un lapin du païs de Galles." In the Royal Dictionary, he continues, Smollett would have found " Duelos y Quebrantos " defined, in Spanish, as "a name peculiar to La Mancha, signifying a kind of amlet made of eggs and brains of beasts" ( p. 11). Windham's criticisms may strike us as po-faced and trifling, but they are often just. For whatever reason (it was, as Windham grants, a "dear" set of volumes), Smollett chose to ignore the Royal Dictionary, preferring instead to rely on that of Captain John Stevens in Spanish and English. 5 In two other instances, indeed, he acknowledged, silently, the justice of Windham's censures by correcting the errors. 6 On the evidence of the specimen, Windham doubted that Smollett's command of Spanish was adequate to the exacting task of translating Cervantes' masterpiece--a work whose linguistic range and richness is comparable in English only to the canon of Shakespeare. But he did not carry this complaint as far as Smollett's enemy, John Shebbeare would do, who in 1757 insisted that Smollett was "extemely ignorant" of the languages he pretended to translate, not Spanish only but French as well 7 (the latter accusation, it may be said, doing little for Shebbeare's credibility, for French is a language that Smollett certainly knew). It was Shebbeare who started the rumor that Smollett at the time he contracted to translate Don Quixote "did not understand Spanish": such, he claimed, was the objection put to the publisher, Andrew Millar, by a fellow Scot--to which Millar replied that Smollett "had been a full six Weeks to study that Language amongst the native Spaniards , at Brussels ." 8 As I will suggest later, this anecdote, if true, can more easily be taken as evidence of Smollett's impressive facility with languages than as a symptom of his ignorance of Spanish. The slurs of Windham and Shebbeare had little effect on the popularity of Smollett's Don Quixote , which, buoyed by Ralph Griffiths' praise in the Monthly Review , 9 continued to be preferred by most readers over every other English version until the end of the century: from 1755 to 1799 it was published in various editions and reprints no fewer than nineteen times, whereas the versions of his chief rivals, Jarvis and Motteux, were reissued during the same period just four times each. 10 Not long after the turn of the century, however, the balance began shifting against him, the reputation of Smollett's translation declining to the point where, after 1858, it ceased to be reprinted for almost 130 years, until, in 1986, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published a new (but very imperfect) 11 edition, with an Introduction by Carlos Fuentes. The turning point in the fortunes of Smollett's work would seem to be the publication in 1791 of Lord Woodhouselee's Essay on the Principles of Translation . In an influential chapter on the "Difficulty of translating Don Quixote," Woodhouselee discusses and compares what he considers to be "the best Translations" of the novel, reaching the eccentric conclusion that Motteux's version is "by far the best we have yet seen." 12 Though Woodhouselee makes what I take to be the essential point when, with Smollett in mind, he doubts that it is "possible to conceive a writer more completely qualified to give a perfect translation" of Cervantes' masterpiece (p. 178), he declares his disappointment with Smollett's performance, expressing for the first time the criticism that would prove to be most damaging: Smollett, he states, was merely Jarvis's "copiest and improver" (p. 184); he gave us "little else than an improved edition" (pp. 181-82) of Jarvis's dull, but faithful, translation. By the 1880s this criticism, together with the conviction that Smollett was incompetent to translate Cervantes' Spanish, became authoritative when it was reiterated by two eminent Cervantists who, in promoting their own translations, found it necessary to depreciate those that came before. In 1881 Alexander James Duffield accused Smollett of ignoring the original while following Jarvis "servilely"; his translation "is only redeemed from the weakness of plagiarism by the occasional use of choice and special words, to which," Duffield at least allows, "all future translators must stand indebted." 13 In 1885 John Ormsby, author of the best of the new translations, dismissed Smollett's out of hand, asserting that it "has no value, being, indeed, little more than a rifacimento of Jervas's, made without any regard to the original." 14 In 1888 Henry Edward Watts, author of the third important translation of Don Quixote to appear in the decade, was no less severe. He conceded that "[t]he author of Humphrey [sic] Clinker was gifted with a genius not without affinity to that of Cervantes, but unfortunately he knew no Spanish." Watts, though he did not accuse Smollett of stealing from Jarvis, added a wilder surmise of his own, supposing he had "done his book out of the French . . ."; the book was, in any case, "altogether worthless." 15 Though unsubstantiated, the opinions of Duffield, Ormsby, and Watts, all three able hispanists, carried weight in helping to sink the reputation of Smollett's translation; but it remained for Carmine Rocco Linsalata to mount the only attack on the work that need trouble us today. In his doctoral dissertation of 1949--and subsequently in a pair of articles and the monograph Smollett's Hoax based on the dissertation 16 --Linsalata subjected Smollett's translation to an anatomy that, he believed, proved empirically the work had been cribbed wholesale from Jarvis. The simplest explanation for the plagiarism was clear to him: "As for Smollett's knowledge of Spanish," he declared, "I am convinced he had none." 17 Indeed, Linsalata carried speculation still farther: he could not allow that Smollett himself was author of so shabby a production as this, preferring to suppose instead that he had jobbed it out in pieces to a "school" of hacks in his employ. To the translation that bears Smollett's name he allows just one, dubious, virtue: it is, he concludes, "a gem in the realm of fraudulent acts." 18 We will return to Linslata's case against Smollett in a moment; but before we do, another--and easily the most extraordinary--episode in the long chronicle of abuse directed at Smollett's Don Quixote remains to be told. At the time Linsalata was accusing him of fraud, Smollett himself became the intended victim of one of the most audacious literary hoaxes of our time--a wonderfully impudent attempt to deprive him of any credit for the translation by adducing what purported to be the hardest evidence of all: nothing less than his own written confession. In 1948, as Linsalata toiled at his dissertation in Austin, Texas, Professor Francesco Cordasco of Long Island University, New York, made a surprising announcement in the pages of Notes &amp; Queries . 19 "[T]hrough the kindness of [his] kinsman, Don Miguel Madorma of Madrid," he had acquired "a considerable body" of the correspondence of Ricardo Wall, Spanish Ambassador to London from 1748 to October 1752, and the person to whom Smollett dedicated the translation. From this trove of letters, Cordasco published three which, he declared, "are of extreme importance for the revelation they make of the part Smollett played in the translation of Don Quixote which appeared in 1755 in London under his name, and which has enjoyed such [a] contentious claim since in the Smollett canon." These letters, he explained, were "precipitated by Smollett's efforts in the late 1750's to secure the Consulship at Madrid." The earliest of the three (dated Casa Junqueira, Madrid, 2 September 1759) was Ricardo Wall's querulous reply to the Duchess of Hamilton, who had recommended Smollett for the consulship--an office, Wall assured her, for which he was not at all suited: for one thing, he was "not a person of importance &amp; position"; for another, he had been in Wall's company just once at his London residence, and Wall had found him "unable to answer in the Language when I addressed questions," even though he was then "engaged in the Translation." As for the translation itself, Wall despised it. What is more, he had reason to believe it was not Smollett's work at all: "I had notice," he assured the Duchess, "when this work appeared that [Smollett] had not executed it; but it was the task of one Mr Pettigrew, whom I do not know." To this on 22 October 1759 Lady Hamilton replied that she had informed Smollett he would not be appointed to the consulship, and that he had confirmed Wall's suspicions: "I have tendered him [Smollett] regrets," she writes, "and he fully affirms poor knowledge of the Language, and accords Mr Pettigrew of Bone St the Translation inscribed to you." Cordasco's find was a fortunate one indeed, for the third and final letter removed any possibility of doubt about the truth of these revelations. From Chelsea on 16 November, Smollett himself wrote to Wall as follows: The Translation of Quixotte was not undertaken with anticipation of exacting debt; but its inscription was for the illustrious Place you hold in our nations' Affairs. I own that my knowledge of the Language is modest, &amp; that the work was largely that of Isaiah Pettigrew; and so does the art of Translation flourish in the fair metropolis. Having thus effectually removed the translation from the Smollett canon once for all, Cordasco remained puzzled by one remaining problem: "Who was Isaiah Pettigrew of Bone Street? Enquiry and research," he regrets, "have proved futile thus far." As well they might, for Isaiah Pettigrew never existed, nor was there ever a Bone Street in London before the nineteenth century. 20 The authenticity of the three letters--and of two other "finds" of the same kind--was challenged by Lewis Knapp and Lillian de la Torre in their review of Cordasco's edition of Smollett's correspondence (1950). At their instance a committee of experts was formed to examine the evidence, the members being Allen T. Hazen, Frederick B. Adams, Jr., and Louis A. Landa. Professor Cordasco could furnish them with just one of the "original" letters, which was judged a forgery. Cordasco publicly accepted this verdict, declaring that he was now convinced all five letters were forgeries, but denying that he had forged them. He had been himself an innocent dupe in this--a "Smollett Hoax" of quite another stripe. 21 By the middle decades of our century, Smollett's ghost might be pardoned for developing a persecution complex in the matter of the translation of Don Quixote . Though, thanks to the alertness of his guardians in the academy, the mischief of the forged letters has been nullified, Professor Linsalata's charges are less easily refuted. 22 These are as follows: (1) that the translation published under his name was in all probability the production not of Smollett himself, but of a "school" of hackney scribblers; (2) that Smollett knew no Spanish; and (3) that, in any case, the work is nothing more than a plagiarism or close paraphrase of Jarvis's version. What credence do these accusations deserve?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Smollett's "Hack School" As we have seen, Isaiah Pettigrew of Bone Street, Cordasco's candidate for the authorship of Smollett's Don Quixote , proved to be an insubstantial ghost--his name and local habitation returned to airy nothing by the exposure of the forged letters. Linsalata, however--convinced that Smollett knew no Spanish and therefore at a loss to explain the occurrence of passages in the translation that correct Jarvis's inaccuracies--solved the puzzle to his own satisfaction by attributing the work to an entire workshop of phantom scribblers whom he supposed to be in Smollett's employ. 23 Given the contradiction between Smollett's alleged incompetence and the frequent felicities of the translation as he found it, Linsalata's hypothesis was perhaps not unreasonable --especially in light of the fact that Smollett, in the late 1750s, is known to have supported just such a band of hackney authors whose company amused him and whose small talents he put to use in the various, often voluminous, literary projects he was engaged in: projects such as his Complete History of England in 11 volumes (1757-58) and its Continuation in 5 volumes (1760-65). It is Shebbeare again, Smollett's enemy, who first mentions his "hack school" in a mock-advertisement dated from Smollett's house in Chelsea, 26 November 1757: Besides himself he has under him several journeymen-authors, so that all those who chuse to have a subject fitted up from the most sublime down to a common advertisement, may be commodiously furnished at his house, where specimens of his works may be seen every day . . . . 24 More reliable testimony of the scribbling satellites that circled round Smollett at this time comes from his friend Alexander Carlyle, who, in his autobiography, recalls meeting Smollett for dinner at Forrest's Coffeehouse, Chelsea, in 1758: He was now become a great man, and being much of a humorist, was not to be put out of his way. Home and Robertson and Smith and I met him there, when he had several of his minions about him, to whom he prescribed tasks of translation, compilation, or abridgment, which, after he had seen, he recommended to the booksellers. 25 This may well be the same circle of literary "myrmidons," as Carlyle calls them--they were five in number, all "curious characters"--whom Smollett himself would later immortalize in Humphry Clinker . 26 There is, however, no evidence connecting Smollett with this club of hireling authors until well after publication of his Don Quixote early in 1755. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that he produced that work on his own. Since Smollett did not gather his authors around him until some time after he moved to Chelsea from the Strand in June of 1750, Linsalata (who mistakenly placed the move in 1752) assumed that "no serious work was done on Don Quixote " until after that date. 27 Smollett himself, however, points to a different period of composition. In advertisements for the translation that ran in the Public Advertiser during March 1754, he assured potential subscribers that "the Work was begun and the greatest Part actually finished four Years ago." 28 By this reckoning the bulk of the translation must have been written during the period from the latter months of 1748 to March 1750, before Smollett established himself in Chelsea. It was in June 1748 that he contracted to produce the work, and before the year was out he had made substantial progress on it. This seems a reasonable inference from the publisher's announcement in November 1748 that the translation was " Preparing for the PRESS "--an announcement repeated nearly a year later, in September 1749. 29 Other business, undertaken because he needed money, prevented Smollett from keeping up the expeditious pace with which he began the work; and, since he had been paid in advance for it, there was no urgency about finishing. 30 During the six years and more that passed between his contracting to do the translation and its publication, Smollett engaged himself in an astonishing number of other projects of every description: translations of Le Sage's Gil Blas (October 1748) and The Devil upon Crutches (1750), as well as Voltaire's Micromegas (1752); an opera Alceste (c. 1748-49), a tragedy The Regicide (1749), a comedy The Absent Man (1750); the novels Peregrine Pickle (1751) and Ferdinand Count Fathom (1753); a medical treatise On the External Use of Water (1752), as well as two volumes of Dr. William Smellie's Treatise on midwifery (1751, 1754) which Smollett prepared for the press. These productions, and much more besides, attest to the pressures of Smollett's straitened circumstances during this period. It is unlikely he had the money, even if we suppose he had the inclination, to farm out the translation of Don Quixote for others to make a hash of. Not until the spring of 1754, when he published his proposals to subscribers, did he have the incentive to put all else aside and finish the work. This is the situation he described to Dr. Macaulay in a letter of 11 December 1754: For my own part, I never was reduced to such a dilemma as I am now brought into; for I have promised to pay away tradesmens' bills, to a considerable amount, by Christmas; and my credit absolutely depends upon my punctuality. Nay, I am put to very great straits for present subsistence as I have done nothing all the last summer but worked upon Don Quixotte, for which I was paid five years ago. 31 The spectacle of Smollett's frenetic literary activity during this period accounts readily enough for the delay in completion of the translation, which obviously was not being carried forward by other hands. Smollett's own statements point to what actually happened. Having been paid in advance for the translation, he worked at it more or less steadily until, some time in 1750, he had completed "the greater Part" of it. Then, in need of money, he set the translation aside to undertake fresh projects; not until the summer of 1754 is there evidence of his resuming the work in earnest to fulfill the agreement with his publishers made six years earlier. Two passages from Peregine Pickle (1751), chapters ci-cii, seem directly relevant to the theory of Smollett's "hack school." In the first, Smollett treats with scorn precisely the kind of figure Linsalata would make him out to be: the literary entrepreneur who resorts to the cynical expedient of producing books--and translations in particular--by job lot: [Pickle] had, in his affluence, heard of several authors, who, without any pretensions to genius, or human literature, earned a very genteel subsistence, by undertaking work for booksellers, in which reputation was not at all concerned. One (for example) professed all manner of translation, at so much per sheet, and actually kept five or six amanuenses continually employed, like so many clerks in a compting-house; by which means, he was enabled to live at his ease, and enjoy his friend and his bottle, ambitious of no other character than that of an honest man, and a good neighbour. 32 A few pages later in the narrative, Smollett introduces an author of a different character, though again a translator, whose case resembles his own soon after he declared his intention to translate Cervantes' masterpiece--an announcement that prompted rival booksellers to issue new editions of the competing translations by Jarvis and Motteux. 33 . . . another gentleman exhibited a complaint, signifying, that he had undertaken to translate into English a certain celebrated author, who had been cruelly mangled by former attempts; and that, soon as his design took air, the proprietors of those miserable translations had endeavoured to prejudice his work, by industrious insinuations, contrary to truth and fair dealing, importing, that he did not understand one word of the language which he pretended to translate. (p. 645) Smollett, as we will see, had reason to resent the insinuation that he neither knew Spanish nor wrote the translation of Don Quixote that appeared under his name in 1755. That he was ready enough, in producing that work, to avail himself silently of a variety of printed sources will also become clear, and will surprise no one who is acquainted with authorial practice of the period. But by the standards of his day the work was his own, not that of a "hack school." 34 In 1763 Smollett obliged Richard Smith of New Jersey by sending him a brief account of his life. Prominent in what he called "a genuine List of my Productions" included in the letter is "A Translation of Don Quixote." Notable, too, is the indignation with which he denied the charge that was levelled at him in his own time and in ours: "I am much mortified to find it is believed in America that I have lent my name to Booksellers; that is a species of Prostitution of which I am altogether incapable." 35</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Smollett's Knowledge of Spanish The charge that Smollett knew no Spanish can be laid to rest with some confidence. There is much evidence that he understood Spanish and had studied Don Quixote in the original. Simply considering the general question of Smollett's facility with languages, there is every probability he could have acquired a reasonable competence in Spanish in a relatively short time. As a boy he was taught Latin by John Love, headmaster of the Dumbarton grammar school and a man respected as a classical scholar and pedagogue. At Dumbarton not only the lectures but the dialogues between student and master were in Latin; indeed, if a boy slipped into the vernacular in class he could be whipped. 36 Smollett learned his lessons well. As an adult he read Claudian aloud, in Latin, to his friend William Huggins; 37 and during his travels in France he was capable of writing, entirely in Latin, a lengthy diagnosis of his ailments addressed to the eminent physician, Dr. Fizès, who, Smollett scornfully remarks, could answer him only in French. 38 That Smollett read French easily is clear not only from his translations of Le Sage, Fénelon and Voltaire, but also from the notes to his Don Quixote , for which he made extensive use of Louis Moréri's Grand dictionnaire historique , and also (and much more impressively) of M. de la Curne de Ste. Palaye's "Mémoires sur l'ancienne chevalerie," 39 in which many passages consist of quotations from medieval sources. From his correspondence with William Huggins, the translator of Ariosto and Dante, we also know that Smollett had a sufficient command of Italian to be able to read Francesco Berni's Orlando innamorato as well as Ariosto's Orlando furioso in the original: "Since I parted from you in the Country," Smollett wrote Huggins in November 1759, "I have read Berni and the orlando furioso in the Italian from one end to the other, and was indeed become a sort of a Knight errant in Imagination . . . ." 40 Later, anticipating his journey to Italy, he wrote William Hunter that he was "giving my whole attention to the Italian Language which I think I shall be able to speak tolerably in six months." 41 Linguistic facility such as this, at least in the romance languages, did not seem particularly extraordinary to the educated class of Great Britain in the eighteenth century, most of whom attended schools where, as Fielding put it, a boy had Latin "inoculated into his Tail." 42 Fielding, for one, considered this sort of aptitude for languages completely unremarkable. From Lisbon where he planned to write a history of Portugal, he wrote his half-brother John asking that he send him "a conversible Man," someone of learning and good humor, to be his companion and amanuensis: it would be an advantage, of course, if the man understood Portuguese or Spanish, "which," however, Fielding assured his brother, "if he doth not, he may easily, if he hath the Latin Grammatical Rudiments, learn . . . ." 43 It is not unlikely, then, that Smollett could have acquired a competence in Spanish without great difficulty. But the case for his knowledge of the language needn't rest on probabilities alone. In letters to friends Smollett expressly stated his qualifications both to undertake the translation of Don Quixote and to serve as British consul at Madrid. In June 1748, before beginning the work, he wrote Alexander Carlyle: "I have contracted with two Booksellers to translate Don Quixote from the Spanish Language, which I have studied some time." 44 How long, one wonders, was "some time"? If Shebbeare's story is true that Smollett had studied Spanish in Brussels for six weeks, the period in question--to judge from what we know of his movements--would probably have been a time in the early 1740s. Later, in a letter of December 1762, Smollett informed John Home that "[i]n the last ministry" (probably in the autumn of 1759) he had "made some advances towards the Consulship of Madrid for which I thought myself in some respects qualified, as I understood the Spanish Language and was personally known to Mr. Wall, the minister of his catholic majesty." 45 That he did not mean to deceive his friends by pretending to knowledge he did not have is certain from the testimony of John Moore, one of Smollett's closest friends and the editor of his Works (1797). In his biographical sketch of Smollett, Moore takes up the question of his competence to undertake the translation of Don Quixote ; his observations on the subject are eminently sane and to our purpose: [Smollett] has been accused [Moore writes] of not having had a sufficient knowledge of the Spanish language when he undertook that task. To perform it perfectly, it would be requisite that the translator had lived some years in Spain; that he had obtained not only a knowledge of the language of the court and polite society, but an acquaintance also with the vulgar idioms, the proverbs in use among the populace, and the various customs of the country to which allusions are made. It would likewise be requisite that the translator of Cervantes should be a man of genius, of a great native fund of humour, of a complete knowledge of his own language, and the power of adopting the solemn, the familiar, the ironical, and the burlesque phraseology as they suited the occasion. It will probably be long before all those requisites are united in one man, and that he shall be inclined to translate Don Quixote. Dr. Smollett possessed, in an eminent degree, the qualities last mentioned; and although he never was in Spain, he certainly had a very considerable knowledge of the language; that he had been at pains to inform himself of many of the obsolete customs of the country appears by the notes to his translation. 46 To the testimony of Smollett and his friend that he understood the language of Cervantes, we may add other clear signs from outside the text of the translation itself that he read Don Quixote in the original--read it perhaps with some difficulty, but read it nevertheless. Included in the list of books seized by the customs when Smollett landed at Boulogne to begin his travels in 1763 are two copies of Cervantes' masterpiece: one a translation of Don Quixote in four volumes (probably the second edition of his own version [1761]); the other, Don Quixote in the original Spanish. He also carried with him five dictionaries: in Greek, Latin, French, Italian--and in Spanish. 47 Incidental passages scattered throughout Smollett's writings also suggest that he was well acquainted with the language of Cervantes. He understood, for instance, the characteristics of Spanish pronunciation, and he could recall at will some of Cervantes' more colorful locutions in Don Quixote . In Italy on his travels Smollett commented on "the pronunciation of the Tuscans," which he found "disagreeably guttural: the letters C and G they pronounce with an aspiration, which hurts the ear of an Englishman; and is, I think, rather rougher than that of the X, in Spanish. It sounds as if the speaker had lost his palate." 48 In Adventures of an Atom the mob, "like the cow-heel in Don Quixote [II.iv.7; 2: 374-75] 49 . . . seemed to cry, Comenme, comenme ; Come eat me, come, eat me." 50 And, chiding his friend Huggins for complaining that he was oppressed with business, Smollett recalled one of Cervantes' favorite expressions ("tortas y pan pintado") that recurs in Don Quixote ( e.g. I.iii.3; 1: 94): "You talk of the Pistrinum or Cart's Tail; that is, according to the Spanish Proverb, no more than panpintado , Cakes and Gingerbread to what I undergo" 51 --it is worth noting, moreover, that Smollett's translation of pan pintado is a closer English equivalent than any previous attempt ( e.g. Jarvis: "tarts and cheese-cakes"), and was adopted by Putnam. Later, we will consider what the translation itself reveals about Smollett's command of the language of Cervantes. For now it should be clear that, as he claimed, he had studied Spanish and was entirely capable of reading it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Jarvis and the Question of Plagiarism . The third charge against Smollett's Don Quixote --namely, that the work is a plagiarism of Jarvis's version--brings its place in the canon into question no less surely than if it had been written by committee, as Linsalata supposed. The charge originated in 1791 with Lord Woodhouselee, who called the work "little else than an improved edition" of Jarvis, whose own version, though faithful to the literal sense of the original, he found "heavy and aukward." 52 Confirmed, as we earlier remarked, by Duffield and Ormsby in the next century, and more recently by Samuel Putnam, 53 this remains the orthodox verdict on both authors. No one before Linsalata, however, was willing to undertake the drudgery of attempting to prove by collation the extent of Smollett's dependence on Jarvis 54 --or, indeed, of his dependence on other possible models in English and in French. By comparing a dozen selected passages from Smollett with the corresponding passages in the translations by Thomas Shelton (1612-20), John Philips (1687), Peter Motteux (1700), and John Stevens (1700)--and by similarly comparing twenty-eight short excerpts from Smollett and the French of Oudin-Rosset--Linsalata was satisfied he had sufficiently demonstrated the improbability that Smollett had followed any of these versions in producing his own. 55 What these collations actually reveal, however, is the dependence of Stevens on Shelton (whose work he revised) and the closeness of Smollett's phraseology to that of Stevens--the reason for this being that Jarvis, who served as Smollett's guide through the difficulties of Cervantes' Castillian, wrote with his own eye on Shelton. In this period, threading labyrinths to the source of a translation is, generally speaking, no simple task. The version called Motteux's, for example, was not written, but published, by him--the work itself being, as the title-page declares, a pastiche executed "by several Hands." There is reason, moreover, to doubt that the version published under the name of Charles "Jarvis" was in fact wholly written by Pope's friend, the portrait painter Charles Jervas (the name itself being garbled on the title-page): Jervas died in 1739, three years before the work was published in 1742; he was not, except for this one ambitious work, an author at all; and Pope, who knew him well, declared to Warburton that he had no Spanish. 56 What concerns us, however, is not the authorship of the translation published under Jarvis's name, but the extent to which Smollett depended on it for his own. For the answer to this question, we are chiefly indebted to Linsalata, who alone has performed the task of comparing, page by page, the two versions of Cervantes' novel--a work of more than 400,000 words. The result of his collation, however, is more ambiguous than it appeared to either Linsalata or his champion, Professor Knowles, who believed that Linsalata had "demonstrate[d] beyond any reasonable doubt that the bulk of the Smollett translation was a poorly disguised theft from that of Jarvis." 57 The documentation to which Knowles refers consists of 472 parallel passages (ranging in size from two to sixty-two typewritten lines) which Linsalata divides into four distinct categories of literary theft: namely, to use his own terms, "plagiarism," "paraphrasing," "rewriting," and "inversion." In Smollett's Hoax (pp. 14-15) he illustrates these techniques with the following examples comparing the original with the versions of Jarvis and Smollett: PLAGIARISM Cervantes : Y diciendo esto, puso las espuelas a Rocinante y, puesta la lanza en el ristre, bajó de la costezuela como un rayo (II, 88) 58 Jarvis : And saying this he clapped spurs to Rocinante, setting his lance in its rest, and darted down the hillock like lightning. (I, 90) Smollett : So saying, he clapped spurs to Rozinante, and putting his lance in the rest, darted down from the hillock like lightning. (I, 104) Cervantes : En tanto que Sancho Panza y su mujer Teresa Cascajo pasaron la impertinente referida plática, no estaban ociosas la sobrina y el ama de don Quijote, que por mil señales iban coligiendo que su tío y señor quería desgarrarse la ves tercera, y volver al ejercicio de su, para ellas, mal andante caballería: procuraban por todas las vías posibles apartarle de tan mal pensamiento; pero todo era predicar en desierto y majar en hierro frío. (V, 113) Jarvis : While Sancho Panza and his wife Teresa Cascajo were holding the foregoing impertinent conversation, Don Quixote's niece and housekeeper were not idle; who guessing from a thousand signs that their uncle and master would break loose the third time, and return to the exercise of his unlucky knight-errantry, endeavoured, by all possible means to divert him from so foolish a design; but it was all preaching in the desert, and hammering cold iron. (II, 27) Smollett : While this impertinent conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife Teresa Cascajo, Don Quixote's niece and housekeeper were not idle; for, collecting from a thousand symptoms, that their master wanted to give them the slip a third time, and return to the exercise of his unlucky knight-errantry, they endeavoured, by all possible means, to divert him from his extravagant design: but, all they could say, was like preaching to the desert, or hammering cold iron. (II, 30) PARAPHRASING Cervantes : Hecho esto, dieron orden en que los tres compañeros nuestros se rescatasen, por facilitar la salida del baño, y porque viéndome a mí rescatado, y a ellos no, pues había dinero, no se alborotasen y les persuadiese el diablo que hiciesen alguna cosa en perjuicio de Zoraida . . . . (IV, 53) Jarvis : When this was done, means were concerted for redeeming our three companions, and getting them out of the bath, lest, seeing me ransomed and themslves not, knowing there was money sufficient, they should be uneasy, and the devil should tempt them to do something to the prejudice of Zoraida. (I, 274) Smollett : This affair being transacted, means were concerted for ransoming my three companions; lest, seeing me at liberty and themselves confined, since I had money enough to procure their freedom, they should be chagrined, and tempted by the devil, to do something to the prejudice of Zorayda . . . . (I, 313) Cervantes : ...es un lazo que si una vez le echáis al cuello, se vuelve en el nudo gordiano, que si no le corta la guadaña de la muerte, no hay desatarle. Muchas más cosas pudiera decir en esta materia, si no lo estorbara el deseo que tengo de saber si le queda más que decir al señor licenciado acerca de la historia de Basilio. (VI, 16) Jarvis : . . . she is a noose which, when once thrown about the neck, turns to a Gordian knot, and cannot be loosed till cut asunder by the scythe of death. I could say much more upon this subject, were I not prevented by the desire I have to know whether Signor the licentiate has any thing more to say concerning the history of Basilius. (II, 97) Smollett : Marriage is a noose, into which, if the neck should happen to slip, it becomes inexplicable as the gordian knot, and cannot be undone till cut asunder by the scythe of death. Much more could I add upon the subject, if I were not prevented by the desire I have to know, whether Mr. licentiate has any thing further to entertain us with relative to the history of Basilius. (II, 112-13) REWRITING Cervantes : --Eso fuera--respondió Sancho--cuando faltaran por estos prados las yerbas que vuestra merced dice que conoce, con que suelen suplir semejantes faltas los tan malaventurados andantes caballeros como vuestra merced es. (II, 96) Jarvis : "It would be so," answered Sancho, "if these fields did not produce those herbs you say you know with which such unlucky knights-errant as your worship are wont to supply the like necessities." (I, 92) Smollett : "That would certainly be the case, answered the squire, if the meadows did not furnish those herbs you say, you know, with which, unfortunate knights like your worship, are wont to make up such losses." (I, 107) Cervantes : ¡Heroica resolución del gran Filipo Tercero, y inaudita prudencia el haberla encargado el tal don Bernardino de Velasco! (VIII, 203) Jarvis : Heroic resolution of the great Philip the Third, and unheard of wisdom in committing this charge to Don Bernardino de Velasco. (II, 350) Smollett : . . . heroic resolution of the great Philip III, who has, at the same time, displayed the most consummate wisdom, in committing the execution of the scheme to the courage and ability of Don Bernardino de Velasco. (II, 421) INVERSION Cervantes : --Bien está eso--dijo don Quijote--; pero yo sé lo que ahora conviene que sa haga. (II, 223) Jarvis : "It is well," said Don Quixote; "but I know what is now expedient to be done." (I, 122) Smollett : "That may be a very good expedient, said the knight; but I know what is proper for me to do at present." (I, 141) In making his case against the integrity of Smollett's translation, Linsalata presumably considered these seven parallel passages among the most definitive and damning of the 472 he culled in the course of collation. For this reason--and recalling the axiom that one can gauge the full measure of Hercules from the dimensions of his foot--I have reprinted them at length. What do they in fact reveal about Smollett's habits of literary appropriation--to borrow that useful term from Roger Lund's essay on the practice of Pope? 59 We can agree, I believe, that the claim that Smollett subjected Jarvis's text to four distinct "techniques" of appropriation is specious: at what point does plagiarism shade into paraphrase, and when does paraphrase become rewriting, or rewriting, inversion? Besides this unhelpful confusion of terms, not all the examples above will be seen to serve Linsalata's purpose: the last two passages show nothing more than Smollett freely rendering the sense of a line or two of the original--an aspect of the theory of translation in the period to which he explicitly subscribes in his preface. These same two passages, moreover, remind us that, whatever liberties a translator may allow himself in order to convey the spirit of the original, he is also concerned to render as faithfully as possible the sense of the work; and the range of synonymous locutions in his own language is limited. Is it surprising, therefore, that both Jarvis and Smollett should use identical words in translating, for example, "Heroica resolución del gran Filipo Tercero"? Except for Shelton, who was first to translate Don Quixote into any language, this simple constraint, inherent in the nature of the genre, has meant that every subsequent translator of the work will be heard to echo, from time to time, one or more of his predecessors. This being so, Smollett's decision to turn when in doubt to Jarvis, author of the most literally exact translation available to him, 60 may be seen as a virtue; it imparted an essential accuracy to his translation as he set about meeting the greater challenge of capturing the color and vitality of Cervantes' masterpiece. Linsalata has adduced enough unquestionable evidence to demonstrate the extent of Smollett's dependence on Jarvis. Even so, far from justifying the claim that Smollett's translation was a hoax, that evidence just as surely points to Smollett's having written the great bulk of the work with his eye on Cervantes, not on Jarvis. Even if we grant the relevance to Linsalata's case of all 472 examples of Smollett's alleged borrowing from Jarvis--and besides that figure being inflated, as we have seen, it includes at least one example in which Smollett's rendering of the original has been shown to be more accurate than that of Jarvis 61 --it will appear that 86 per cent of the text did not yield passages to his purpose. 62 Indeed, the number of readers who have compared the two versions without suspecting Smollett of plagiarism supports the view that the offending passages are relatively few and far between. Windham--though, to be sure, he had examined only the specimen of Smollett's translation and not the whole work--was so little inclined to make this particular complaint that he could "scarcely suppose [Smollett] ever could have seen" Jarvis's more accurate version; and Griffiths, the first actually to compare the rival versions of the same passage from the original, was in no doubt that Smollett's "genius (notwithstanding some things that appear to be rather inaccuracies than defects in judgment) comes nearest the great original." 63 Far more impressive is the verdict of Charles Duff, an able linguist and translator of numerous Spanish authors, including Quevedo. At the request of Smollett's biographer, Lewis Melville, Duff compared Smollett's translation with other "standard" translations and came to the following conclusion: Whilst "cribbing" much of the meanings from Jarvis's translation . . . Smollett's may be called, in spite of criticisms to the contrary, very much his own work. It runs more smoothly than all other translations; the inaccuracies are not fatal to the work as a whole; and my view is that it deserves to be reprinted . . . . 64 Sixty years would pass before the Noonday Press took this hint, publishing in 1986 a reprint of the first edition with an Introduction by Carlos Fuentes. In his Foreword, Fuentes declared his preference for Smollett's Don Quixote over all other English versions. In this, he was not alone among readers whose native language is the language of Cervantes. Francisco Rodríguez Marín, perhaps the preeminent Cervantist of our century (whose edition of Don Quixote Linslata himself regards as authoritative), was of the same opinion. When told by Cordasco of David Hannay's opinion that Smollett was sufficiently in sympathy with his author to have produced a translation having "an original literary value of its own," Rodríguez Marín replied that "he heartily approved" that judgment: "of all English translations, he entertained a particular fondness for that of Smollett." 65</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. Smollett and the Question of Originality . The qualities that make Smollett's version of Don Quixote the most readable in our language are chiefly attributable, of course, to his own powers as a novelist and to his command of the full stylistic range of English discourse; he had a "genius," as his contemporaries would call it, unmatched by his competitors in this particular work of translation before or since. Smollett's voice is distinctive, and we hear it plainly throughout the work. In this sense the translation indeed is very much his own. And it is his own as well in a number of formal features that originated with him--such as the introductory "Life of Cervantes," the official preliminaries to Part II of the novel, and many of the explanatory annotations to the text. At the same time, however, Smollett often depended for these innovations on a variety of sources, none of which he chose to acknowledge. It is time to consider more closely the question of Smollett's originality in the translation. That Smollett had a sufficient understanding of Spanish to enable him to work directly from the original ought to have been clear all along from the fact that no translation before his own included the official preliminaries to Part II of the novel: immediately following Cervantes' Preface to the reader, these are the "Approbation" of the Licentiate Marques Torres; "The Ordinary Licence" of Doctor Gutierrez de Cetina; and the further "Approbation" of Joseph de Valdivielso. Only the first of these, the important Approbabtion of Marques Torres, was already available to Smollett in English, since it is quoted in full in Ozell's translation of Gregorio's Life of Cervantes (1738); even so, the version in Smollett's translation is entirely new. Moreover, in the second of the three preliminaries the variant spelling of the Ordinary's name --"Cetina" rather than "Centina"--serves to identify the particular edition of the original used by Smollett; for this spelling is found only in the edition of Don Quixote printed for Juan Mommarte at Brussels in 1662 and subsequently reissued by the Verdussens of Antwerp in 1673 and 1697. 66 It is worth noting that this text--though not equal in authority to the edition of Pedro Pineda (London: J. and R. Tonson, 1738)--was judged by Ormsby to be superior to all other Spanish editions published from 1637 to 1771. 67 As for English sources, though Jarvis was Smollett's principal guide, it is clear from collation of editions available to him at the time of composition that he also consulted Ozell's revision of Motteux (in either the seventh [1743] or eighth [1749] edition), as well as Stevens' revision of Shelton (in either the first [1700] or second [1706] edition). Another source, second in importance only to Jarvis, was Stevens' Spanish-English Dictionary (1706 and 1726). 68 Without naming them, Smollett at the start of his narrative quotes all four of these works in an elaborate footnote (noticed, as we have seen, by Windham) mocking the haplessness of "former translators" who struggled to find an English equivalent for "duelos y quebrantos" (Don Quixote's meal on Saturdays), his own no less hapless solution being "gripes and grumblings." That Smollett consulted these sources throughout the translation is clear from many passages in both the text itself and in his footnotes to the text; these passages, too numerous to list here, will be identified in the explanatory annotations to the forthcoming Georgia edition. Smollett's "originality" in this work--in the particular sense in which that term seems appropriate here--can perhaps best be seen both in the "Life of Cervantes" prefixed to Part I of the novel and in the footnotes to the text. The "Life" was obviously written by Smollett, and at first glance it would appear to be the product of considerable impressive research into primary sources. In his footnotes Smollett cites works by the Spanish scholars Tomás Tamayo de Vargas (1588-1641), Don Nicolas Antonio (1617-84), author of Bibliotheca Hispania (Rome, 1672), and Fr. Diego de Haedo (d. 1608), author of Topographia e Historia general de Argel (Valladolid, 1612); and he appears as well to be acquainted with the entire canon of Cervantes. In truth, however, these were all sources cited by the two authors on whom Smollett entirely depended for the substantive detail of the "Life." Most important of these was Don Gregorio Mayáns y Siscár (1699-1781), keeper of the Royal Library at Madrid and Cervantes' first biographer. Gregorio's Vida de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (Briga-Real, 1737) was translated into English by John Ozell (1738), the translation being reissued subsequently as part of Jarvis's translation of Don Quixote (1742); it is clear from numerous correspondences in phrasing that Smollett's source was not the Spanish of Gregorio, but the English of Ozell. That Gregorio's biography was a likely source for Smollett's "Life" has not gone unnoticed. 69 His other principal source, however, was obscure enough to have been overlooked not only by Gregorio, but also--as William Windham remarked before he had read Smollett's translation--"by all the writers which I have seen, that mention Cervantes...." 70 This was Joseph Morgan's Complete History of Algiers (1728-29) in which Smollett found an account of Cervantes' captivity in Algiers based on Haedo--a stroke of luck that enabled him to become the first of Cervantes' biographers to treat this interesting episode. 71 Smollett's "Life," then, must lay its claim to originality not on the facts it rehearses, but on its author's presentation and interpretation of the facts, an interpretation colored throughout by Smollett's strong personal sympathy with his subject. In the footnotes to the translation this same pattern obtains: Smollett's practice is to abridge and paraphrase a variety of sources, always without acknowledgment. In Smollett's Hoax , Linsalata charged that no fewer than seventy-one of Jarvis's notes were "copied" by Smollett--or rather by Smollett's phantom "journeymen." 72 But besides ignoring Smollett's constant way of improving on Jarvis's prose by reducing his prolix and leaden phrasing to an elegant conciseness, Linsalata, by focussing exclusively on Jarvis in his search for Smollett's sources, failed to see that in a third of his examples Smollett drew either on a source he and Jarvis were independently following, or on a source unknown to Jarvis. In twenty-four of the seventy-one parallels cited, Smollett's debts were to others besides Jarvis, as follows: to John Stevens' Spanish-English Dictionary --thirteen examples; to the commentary of earlier translators, especially Stevens' revision of Shelton and Ozell's revision of Motteux--seven examples; to sources not consulted by Jarvis, namely, Louis Moréri's Grand dictionnaire historique and André Félibien's Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellens peintres anciens et moderne --two examples. Jarvis was certainly an important source for Smollett in annotating Don Quixote , but he was one among many. Of the 187 footnotes in the first edition (1755), forty-seven were based on Jarvis; of the sixteen further footnotes Smollett added to the second edition (1761), only one reveals Jarvis's influence--and in that one Smollett, following Jarvis, regrettably altered his own preferable translation for the worse. 73 In its final form, Smollett's translation includes, as commentary on the text of the novel, 203 footnotes. These are chiefly of five kinds. (1) The great majority explain problematic Spanish words, proverbs, and idiomatic expressions and offer reasons for Smollett's rendering them as he does. For guidance in solving these specifically textual and linguistic difficulties, Smollett relied principally on Stevens' Dictionary --and, of course, on the examples of his predecessors. (2) Of the other notes, twenty-three, most of them new and based on Smollett's close reading of the text, call attention to inconsistencies in Cervantes' plot and characterization. (3) Twenty-one notes, comprising about one tenth of the total, comment on the customs of ancient chivalry: all these, though representing a unique contribution of Smollett's translation, he abridged without acknowledgment from the French of Ste. Palaye's "Mémoires sur l'ancienne chevalerie," published in Mémoires de littérature, tirés des registres de l'Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, depuis l'année M.DCCXLIV, jusques compris l'année M.DCCXLVI , volume 20 (Paris, 1753). Of a similar kind is another note on the customs of Roman Catholic "disciplinants" (II.ii.15; 2: 204 n.) which Smollett abridged from Blainville's Travels through Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and Other Parts of Europe , translated by William Guthrie and others, 3 volumes (1743-45). (4) For information on certain historical figures to whom Cervantes alludes, Smollett turned four times to Moréri's Grand dictionnaire historique ; 74 and once, for a colorful anecdote concerning the wealthy Foucker brothers of Augsburg (II.ii.6; 2: 144 n.), he looked to Félebien's Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellens peintres anciens et modernes (Paris, 1696). (5) Finally, no fewer than five of the notes Smollett added to the second edition were doubtless inspired by his new-found friendship with William Huggins, translator of Ariosto: in one way or another, these all concern the Orlando romances--Boiardo's and Berni's Orlando innamorato and Ariosto's Orlando furioso . Among the triumphs of Smollett's translation is his skillful rendering of Cervantes' poetry. Through the long narrative of his hero's adventures Cervantes scattered some forty poems. These are written on a variety of subjects evoking a range of mood from the pathetic to the ludicrous, and they differ widely in length and form. Indeed, with regard to its formal features the verse is often metrically irregular and dependent for its musical effects on assonant rhymes--features difficult to duplicate in English at any time, and in the age of Pope unthinkable. In this respect, as in the translation as a whole, Smollett succeeded remarkably well in suggesting the qualities of the original without attempting to reproduce them literally: for example, he renders the goatherd Antonio's doric "ditty" to Olalla in seventeen numbered quatrains in an irregular meter alternating between eight and nine syllables (I.ii.3; 1: 56-58); for Chrysostom's "Song of Despair" he chose ten numbered twelve-line stanzas, each rhyming ababcdcdefef (I.ii.[6]; 1: 72-74); for Cardenio's lament, three numbered stanzas of five couplets, metrically very complex--in each, lines 1, 3, 5, 7-10 are tetrameter, lines 2 and 4 dimeter, and line 6 trimeter (I.iii.13; 1: 183); the bogus ghost of Merlin addresses the horrified hero and his squire in forty-nine lugubrious lines of blank verse (II.iii.3; 2: 221-22). And Don Quixote's two comic attempts to sing his imaginary mistress's virtues are, in the first instance, confined to three stanzas of nine lines, in which her name in the refrain "Dulcinea | del Toboso" is made to rhyme with "be a", "defray a" and "to play a" (I.iii.12; 1: 175-76); his later song on the same subject consists of sixteen couplets in lame feet of seven syllables (II.iii.14; 2: 282-83). These examples suggest the care Smollett took to convey the spirit of his great original in the idioms and literary conventions of his own language. In a footnote to the first of these poems, he made clear that he took this responsibility seriously. It is important, I believe, to the question of Smollett's authorship of the translation that he should focus his remarks (though without naming him) on Jarvis; for Smollett well knew that Jarvis's translation, even by Ozell's admission, had already established itself as the most literally exact of previous versions of Don Quixote . Smollett's criticism, supported by his own literal translation of the verses in question, suggests the confidence with which he was prepared to challenge his rival's claims to a superior understanding of both Cervantes' language and the subtleties of his narrative. Commenting on Stanza XI of the goatherd's song, Smollett writes: The reader will perceive that I have endeavoured to adapt the versification to the plainness and rusticity of the sentiment, which are preserved through the whole of this ballad; though all the other translators seem to have been bent upon setting the poetry at variance with the pastoral simplicity of the thoughts. For example, who would ever dream of a goatherd's addressing his mistress in these terms? With rapture on each charm I dwell, And daily spread thy beauty's fame; And still my tongue thy praise shall tell, Though envy swell, or malice blame. The original sentiments which this courtly stanza is designed to translate, are literally these: "I do not mention the praises I have spoke of your beauty, which, though true in fact, are the occasion of my being hated by some other women." [No cuento las alabanças, / Que de tu belleza he dicho, / Que aunque verdaderas, hazen / Ser yo de algunas mal quisto.] (I.ii.3; 1: 58 n.) What, finally, does Smollett's rendering of Cervantes' narrative reveal about the qualities of the translation? The answer to the basic question of his competence in Spanish is not, certainly, as unambiguously negative as we have been led to believe. Though Smollett at times misread the text, in a surprising number of instances he is actually more accurate than any of his predecessors. Far from following Jarvis "servilely," as Duffield put it, Smollett's errors are often owing to a misplaced confidence in his own command of Spanish. Perhaps the most egregious example is his rendering of the expression "en dos paletos," which, as all his predecessors understood, means simply "briefly, instantly": apparently mistaking pelotas (balls) for paletas (trowels or painters' palettes), Smollett unwisely tried to make literal sense of the phrase, twice translating it as "in the twinkling of two balls" (II.iii.19; 2: 319) and "in the turning of two balls" (II.iv.8; 2: 388). Other examples are less hilarious, but no less to the point. (I.iv.14; 1: 315) The Captive relates that as he talked with her father, "salio de la casa del jardin la bella Zorayda, la qual ya avia mucho que me avia visto" ("the lovely Zoraida came out of the garden house. She had caught sight of me some while before" [Putnam]). Smollett alone found this passage confusing: "the fair Zorayda came out into the garden. She had already perceived me from a window of the house . . . ." Jarvis has: "the fair Zoraida , who had espied me some time before, came out of the house." (II.i.1; 2: 9) The page whom Smollett describes as "yellow-haired" is in fact "beardless" ( barbiluzio ), as all Smollett's pedecessors have it. In this he may have been misled by Stevens: " Barbil úzio , one that has a red beard"; " Lúzio [from lúcio ] . . . bright, shining or transparent." (II.ii.10; 2: 170) When Don Quixote uses the proverbial expression, "quando la colera sale de madre, no tiene la lengua padre," Smollett alone renders it, "When choler once is born, the tongue all curb doth scorn," providing in a footnote what he takes to be the literal sense: "When choler quits the mother, the tongue has then no father." In this, however, though he gained a rhyme ("born/scorn"), he missed the meaning. The idiom, "salír de mádre," denotes a river's overflowing its banks (Stevens: Salír ). Jarvis has, "when choler overflows its dam," which ingeniously preserves the double meaning of madre . (II.ii.11; 2: 174) Sancho speaks sarcastically of the hardships of his lot as Don Quixote's squire, using the expression, "en vuestra mano estàescudillar" (literally, "the ladling [of the stew] is in your own hand"). Both Jarvis and Shelton understood the metaphor, Jarvis translating the phrase lamely, but accurately enough: "it is in your own power to dish up the mess"; Smollett makes nonsense of it: "the saddle is in your own hand." (II.iii.15; 2: 292) In bringing a scene of Sancho's indignation to a quiet close, the narrator says, "andese la paz en el corro." Smollett, apparently confusing carréra (career) with corro (company), renders the phrase, "peace attend him in his career"; Jarvis has "peace be with him and company." (II.iv.7; 2: 372) When Don Quixote and his squire sit down to a meal, the narrator ironically remarks that Sancho holds back, "su Señor hiziesse la salva"--a reference to the custom of the nobility's employing "tasters" who sample their food to be sure it is safe to eat. Stevens (s.v. Sálva ) glossed the expression hazér la salva , and Jarvis, following Shelton, got it right: "his master should first be his taster." Smollett, however, disregarding these helps, missed the irony: Sancho "waited . . . until his master should begin." Smollett's translation is not free from errors such as these--errors, it is worth noting, which would not have occurred if he had been tracking Jarvis as closely as we have assumed. Much more remarkable, however, are the number of passages in which he caught the sense of the original more convincingly than Jarvis and other translators. Besides his telling criticism of Jarvis's rendering of the goatherd's song, already cited, consider the following examples: (I.i.2; 1: 10) When Don Quixote calls him "Señor Castellano," the landlord thinks he means one of "los sanos de Castilla." Smollett alone understood the allusion: "Mine host imagining that he called him Castellano*, because he looked like a hypocritical rogue," commenting in his note: " Sano de Castella , signifies a crafty knave." He was presumably indebted to Stevens: " Sáno . . . Sáno de Castilla , in cant, a dissembling thief." Jarvis echoes all previous translators in rendering the passage: "The host thought he called him Castellano because he took him for an honest Castilian ," commenting: " Castellano in Spanish signifies both a governour of a castle , and a native of Castile." (I.i.8; 1: 42) The Biscainer, blustering threats at Don Quixote, inverts a proverbial phrase: "el agua quan presto veràs que al gato llevas." Smollett paraphrased this in a Somerset dialect simulating the Biscainer's rude speech: "'che will soon zee which be the better man*'", and, in a footnote probably indebted to Stevens ( Gáto ), became the first translator to gloss the passage: "The literal meaning of the Spanish is, Thou shalt soon see who is to carry the cat to the water; or rather, in the corrupted Biscayan phrase, 'The water how soon thou wilt see, that thou carriest to the cat." Jarvis, following Motteux and Ozell, has simply, "I will make no more of thee than a cat does of a mouse." (I.ii.4; 1: 61) Referring to Chrysostom, a young man of unimpeachable character and sole heir of his father who has died, Pedro the goatherd calls him "Señor desoluto" of all his father's wealth. Smollett translates this "desolate lord and master"; all previous translators, as well as Ormsby and Watts, have "dissolute"--an adjective entirely inappropriate in context and unlikely in the old spelling of the Spanish, dissoluto rather than the modern disoluto (see Stevens and the Royal Dictionary [1732]). Putnam silently translates it "absolute," desoluto being a barbarism for absoluto (see C. Fernandez Gomes, Vocabulario de Cervantes [Madrid, 1962]). But Smollett's "desolate" desoluto suggesting desolar (Stevens: " Desolár . . . to make desolate")--also preserves the malapropism as well as being appropriate to Chrysostom's grief. (I.iii.7; 1: 126) Soon after Don Quixote mistakes the beat of the fulling-mill hammers for the terrible sound of giants, he prepares to assault a stranger whom he believes to be wearing Mambrino's helmet. Afraid of another painful misadventure, Sancho says, "mas quiera Dios . . . que oregano sea, y no batanes"--adapting to his present purpose the proverbial expression, "á Dios plega que oregano sea y no se nos vuelva alcarabea" ("please God it be marjoram, and not turn carraway upon us" [Watts]). Smollett alone understood the original: he translates, "God grant . . . that this may turn out a *melon rather than a milling," commenting in the footnote that "Oregano . . . signifies sweet marjoram, as if Sancho had wished his master might find a nosegay, rather than a bloody nose." His predecessors either ignore the play on the proverb or get it wrong: "I pray . . . it may not prove another fulling-mill adventure" (Jarvis); "I wish this may'nt prove another blue Bout, and a worse Jobb than the Fulling-Mills" (Motteux and Ozell); "I wish . . . it prove a golden Purchase, and not a Fulling-Mill" (Stevens' revision of Shelton). (I.iv.2; 1: 209) In his footnote on the mythical "kingdom of Micomicon" ("Reyno de Micomicon") Smollett was first to propose that Cervantes intended a play on mico : "As if he had said Ape land: Mico signifying an ape." (I.iv.4; 1: 232) Andrew takes his leave of Don Quixote "and as the saying is, took his foot in his *hand." Smollett in his note was first to gloss the original: "Literally, Took the road in his hands [tomò el camino en las manos]." The expression is not in Stevens or Pineda, and Jarvis and Ozell, without comment, simply have, "and marched off." (I.iv.7; 1: 259) Leonola credits Lothario with "a whole alphabet of accomplishments," and proceeds to name a virtue beginning with every letter in the Spanish alphabet, which has no k and w . Smollett followed the original, omitting words beginning with k and w ; only Shelton before him had preserved this peculiarity of the original, and Smollett seems not to have known Shelton except in Stevens' revision. (I.iv.15; 1: 332) As the curate tells the story of Zoraida and the captive, Cervantes writes: "A todo lo qual estava tan atento el Oydor, que ninguna vez avia sido tan Oydor como entonces," which Smollett renders: "to which the judge listened with more attention than ever he had yielded on the bench*." In annotating the passage, he became the first translator to note Cervantes' play on oidor : "*A judge in Spanish is called Oydor , i.e. Hearer, and the original literally translated , is, 'The hearer was never so much a hearer before.'" (II.i.3; 2: 16) Sancho recalls a time when Rozinante lusted after the mares, or, as he puts it, "'*longed for green peas in December.'" Smollett alone, probably referring to Stevens ( Cotúfas ), glosses this proverbial expression: "* Pedir cotufas en el golfo , signifies to look for tartuffles in the sea, a proverb applicable to those who are too sanguine in their expectations, and unreasonable in their desires." Jarvis, following Shelton, ignores the literal meaning, writing that Rozinante "had a longing after the forbidden fruit". (II.i.4; 2: 23) Sancho, though he avoids all fighting, will look after his master's needs gladly: "yo le baylarè el agua delante." Smollett renders this expression, "'I will †jig it away, with pleasure.'" In his note, probably derived from Stevens ( Agua ), he alone glosses the original: " Baylar el agua delante , is a phrase applicable to those who do their duty with alacrity, taken from the practice of watering the courts in Spain, an office which the maids perform with a motion that resembles dancing." Without comment Jarvis, following Motteux and Ozell, renders this, "I will fetch and carry like any water-spaniel." (II.i.8; 2: 43) Sancho fears that in the spurious continuation of Don Quixote , "andar mi honra àcoche acàcinchado," a proverbial expression which Smollett alone preserves: "'my reputation goes like a jolting hackney-coach.'" (II.i.9; 2: 47) At midnight Don Quixote and Sancho "dexàron el monte" and enter Toledo. Before Smollett, only Stevens in his revision of Shelton had seen that the context requires the secondary meaning of monte (Stevens: " Mónte , a hill, a mountain, a wood"). Smollett has "leaving their covert"; Stevens, "left the Wood." Jarvis, following Shelton, has "left the mountain"; Motteux and Ozell, "descended from a Hill." (II.i.10; 2: 55) Annoyed at Sancho's representing her to Don Quixote as his Dulcinea, the country wench uses a proverbial expression that peasants say to their wives when they beat them: "Mas yo que te estr[i]ego burra de mi suegro"--which Stevens ( Búrra ) renders, "Stand still while I curry you, my father-in-law's ass." Smollett was first to render this in the text ("'Would I had the currying that ass's hide of thine'"); and he was first to understand that the woman speaks it not to the ass she rides on (as in Jarvis's note), but to Sancho. (II.i.13; 2: 71) Sancho compliments Don Quixote with a proverbial expression, referring to him as "moliente, y corriente." Smollett's vivid rendering of this as "well dammed and gristed," comes nearest to the full sense of the original, which literally refers to a mill working well, the water running and the sails going, but metaphorically signifies "anything that is in good order, and no way defective" (Stevens: Moliénte, y corriénte ). Jarvis has merely, "wanting for nothing"; all others, "round and sound." (II.ii.1; 2: 108) After hearing Don Lorenzo's sonnet, Don Quixote compliments him with a play on words: "entre los infinitos Poëtas consumidos que ay, he visto un consumado Poëta." Smollett renders this, "'amidst the infinite number of consumptive poets that now exist, I have found one consummate.'" Only Shelton had previously attempted to translate this word-play, preferring, however, the combination "consumed . . . consummate." Watts and Putnam follow Shelton in rendring consumidos as "consumed"; but Smollett's "consumptive" (Stevens: " Consúmo , consumption") is funnier and makes better sense. (II.iii.2; 2: 216) The duke advises Sancho, when he becomes governor of the island, to take up hunting, "y vereys como os vale un pan por ciento." All translators resort to a loose paraphrase of this puzzling expression, Smollett rendering it, "'which you will find of incredible * service'"; but in his footnote Smollett was first to attempt a literal translation: "And you shall see it will be worth a loaf that will serve an hundred." (II.iii.15; 2: 289) Annoyed at the intrusion of a stranger with a petition, Sancho threatens: "yo ponga en pretina àmas de un negociante"--which Smollett renders, "'I will sit upon * the skirts of more than one of these men of business.'" In his note, Smollett alone offered a literal translation of this expression, which only the Royal Dictionary (1737) glossed (s.v. Pretina ): "*The original Ponga en pretina , signifies, I will put in my girdle." (II.iii.15; 2: 289) The page describes the honest peasant as "una alma de cantaro" (literally, "a soul of a pitcher")--an expression usually used pejoratively to signify a stupid person (as in II.i.13; 2: 71, where Smollett renders it "dull as a beetle"). Smollett was first to see that in context the expression is here meant positively: Shelton has "a very dull Soule"; Jarvis, "a pitcher-soul'd fellow." Smollett's translation, "a simple soul," was indeed adopted by Putnam. (II.iv.[18]; 2: 447) Sancho pities Altisidora, whom Don Quixote has rejected: "Mandote yo, dixo Sancho, pobre Donzella, mandote (digo) mala ventura." Smollett alone preserves the repetition of "mandote" (which, following Stevens [ Mandár ], he renders "bequeath"), as well as the repetition "dixo . . . (digo)": "'Poor damsel! cried he, I can bequeath, bequeath thee nothing, I say, but bad luck.'" Jarvis, for example, has simply, " Poor damsel! Quoth Sancho , I forebode thee ill luck." (II.iv.[19]; 2: 447) In the opening paragraph of the chapter, Smollett's rendering of the obscure expression, "y catalo cantusado," as "and so the farce is acted" anticipates the sense favored by both Ormsby ("and, there, his labour is over") and Watts ("and lo, it is done"). (II.iv.[19]; 2: 450) Insisting that he will keep his promise to scourge himself with three thousand lashes, Sancho quotes a proverb: "àdineros pagados, braços quebrados" ("The money paid, the arms broken"). Smollett alone preserves both the rhyming and the full sense of the proverb: "'When money's paid before it's due, a broken limb will straight ensue.'" Jarvis has, "The money paid, the work delayed"; Stevens, revising Shelton, has the following, which Motteux also adopted: "having received Money before hand, I thought much to work for a dead Horse." * * * * * * The year following publication of the translation of Don Quixote that carries Smollett's name, William Huggins began their friendship by sending him a complimentary copy of his own version of Orlando furioso . In reply, Smollett returned the favor: Dear Sir, I send my Spaniard to return the Compliment I have received by your Italian. Cervantes was a warm Admirer of Ariosto, and therefore Don Quixote cannot be disagreeable to a Lover of Orlando furioso. Though I do not pretend to compare my Prose with your Poetry, I beg you will accept of my Translation as a mark of that Perfect Esteem with which I have the Honour to be Sir, Your most obedt. humble servt., T s . Smollett 75 Smollett, as we have seen, had indeed made Cervantes' masterpiece his own; it is, as he declared it to be, his translation written in his prose (and, as we have seen, his poetry). By the standards of the day, certainly, he had played the game fairly and well. Here, we should remember, is Dryden in a famous passage that defined the theory of translation for a hundred years: The Qualification of a Translator worth Reading must be a Mastery of the Language he Translates out of, and that he Translates into; but if a deficience be to be allow'd in either, it is in the Original, since if he be but Master enough of the Tongue of his Author, as to be Master of his Sense, it is possible for him to express that Sense, with Eloquence, in his own, if he have a through Command of that. But without the Latter, he can never Arive at the Useful and the Delightful; without which, Reading is a Penance and Fatigue. 'Tis true, that there will be a great many Beautys, which in every Tongue depend on the Diction, that will be lost in the Version of a Man, not skill'd in the Original Language of the Author: But then on the other side, First it is impossible to render all those little Ornaments of Speech in any two Languages; and if he have a Mastery in the Sense and Spirit of his Author, and in his own Language have a Stile and Happiness of Expression, he will easily supply all that is lost by that defect. A Translator, that wou'd write with any Force or Spirit of an Original, must never dwell on the Words of his Author: He ought to possess himself entirely, and perfectly comprehend the Genius and Sense of his Author, the Nature of the Subject, and the Terms of the Art or Subject treated of; and then he will express himself as justly, and with as much Life, as if he wrote an Original: Whereas, he who copies Word for Word, loses all the Spirit in the tedious Transfusion. 76 Smollett saw the art of translation in this same light. He believed he understood the character of Cervantes' hero and the humor of his squire. He believed, too, that he understood the spirit of the novel and the idiom that defined its essential character as a literary work. After some years spent in the writing, and in reflecting on what he meant to do and what he had achieved, he addressed his readers in a brief preface: THE Translator's aim in this undertaking, was to maintain that ludicrous solemnity and self-importance by which the inimitable Cervantes has distinguished the character of Don Quixote, without raising him to the insipid rank of a dry philosopher, or debasing him to the melancholy circumstances and unentertaining caprice of an ordinary madman; and to preserve the native humour of Sancho Panza, from degenerating into mere proverbial phlegm, or affected buffoonry. He has endeavoured to retain the spirit and ideas, without servilely adhering to the literal expression, of the original; from which, however, he has not so far deviated, as to destroy that formality of idiom, so peculiar to the Spaniards, and so essential to the character of the work. Smollett achieved his aim of fidelity to the spirit of his great original. At the same time, for the particular enjoyment of his countrymen, he may be said to have translated it in another sense, bringing the work home to them from another time and another country, and making of it, as Dryden recommended, "an Original" in its own right. As Pope in his Iliad adapted Homer to the expectations of readers in England's Augustan Age, so Smollett succeeded in making Cervantes his contemporary. His gruff Biscainer speaks the Somerset dialect of Fielding's Squire Western; and Cervantes' narrator not only writes Smollett's mid-Georgian prose but at times echoes the phrases of Shakespeare and Milton, or recalls a song from The Beggar's Opera . 77 The narrative is colored by homely locutions that would make the plains of La Mancha seem a familiar place to an Englishman: Sancho stuffs his budget with good things to eat, and his stomach wambles; waits strike up tunes, and a skinker pours the wine; hare-hunters search in vain for a scut; desperadoes discharge their fusils; mariners worry about ships that steer athwart their hause. In writing his translation of Don Quixote , Smollett, as he predicted in his preface, did indeed subject himself "to the most invidious comparison" with his rivals--and even, as he could not have predicted, to criticism in our own century designed to abstract him from his work altogether. My purpose in this essay has been to affirm his authorship of the translation and to offer an opinion of its merit. Samuel Johnson, Mrs. Piozzi tells us, considered Don Quixote second only to the Iliad as "the greatest" work of entertainment in the world. 78 As Johnson credited Pope with having produced in his translation of the Iliad "the noblest version" of poetry the world had seen, 79 we may at least, with Carlos Fuentes and Rodríguez Marín, allow that Smollett in his translation of Don Quixote not only succeeded in capturing the spirit of the original for English readers, as he aimed to do, but gave us as well the most readable version of Cervantes' masterpiece in our language.</field>

Clifford (London: Oxford University Press, 1964), p. 637. 33 A few days after John Osborn announced that Smollett's translation was preparing for the press, J. and R. Tonson announced the publication of the second edition of Jarvis's version: "The Whole carefully Revis'd and Corrected, with a new Translation of the Poetical Parts by another Hand" ( General Advertiser , 23, 25 November 1748). On 6 September 1749, the day before Osborn repeated his announcement that Smollett's translation was in preparation, another group of booksellers began announcing publication of the eighth edition of Motteux's version, revised by Ozell ( General Advertiser , 6-9, 11-16, 18-23, 25-28 September 1749). 34 The narrative of Smollett's translation reads so smoothly and so well--is so much of a piece from beginning to end--that it is hard to understand how it could be taken for the production of a "school" of hireling scribblers: the camel, it is well said, is the creation of a committee that tried to design the horse. Professor Aubrun of the Sorbonne could accept Linsalata's hypothesis only by supposing that "Smollett leur donna le 'la' et fixa, pour les plumitifs, la tonalité du style." In the last three chapters of Part I, which struck even Linsalata as original work, Aubrun detected Smollett's controlling hand. After comparing the rival translations of a specimen passage, Aubrun found the "Smollett" version so superior in vitality, and so much more faithful to the spirit of the original, that, he remarked, the differences "prouvent que l'équipe, se défiant de Jarvis, travaille aussi sur quelque autre texte, peut-êre même l'original espagnol."

Robert Adams Day and O M Brack, Jr. (Athens and London: University of Georgia Press, 1989), pp. 57-58, 186 n. 638. Smollett, or the printer, however, mistakes the form of the original: "Comeme, comeme." 51 Smollett to William Huggins (20 June 1757); Knapp, ed. Letters , p.61. 52 Essay on the Principles of Translation , pp. 178, 181-82. 53 See Cervantes, The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote de la Mancha , trans. Samuel Putnam, 2 vols. (New York: Viking Press, 1949), 1: xiii-xiv. 54 Woodhouselee (pp. 185-223) adduced ten passages comparing Smollett and Motteux in order to substantiate his preference for the latter. Duffield (1: l-lvii) similarly compared parallel passages from Shelton, Philips, Motteux, Jarvis, and Smollett (as revised by Thomas Roscoe) in order to highlight the inaccuracies of all five. Before Linsalata, only Gustav Becker had at all seriously attempted to use this method to demonstrate that Smollett paraphrased Jarvis and committed inaccuracies in the process; but Becker's sampling of a dozen brief examples was insufficient to make the case: see Die Aufnahme des Don Quijote in die englische Literatur (1605-c. 1770) (Berlin, 1906), pp. 13-23. 55 See Smollett's Hoax , Appendices E and F. 56 Pope's comments on Jervas's connection with the translation of Don Quixote are puzzling: in a letter of 14 December 1725 he remarked that "Jervas and his Don Quixot are both finish'd" --meaning, apparently, that his friend had completed the translation and was exhausted ( Correspondence , ed. George Sherburn [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956], 2: 350 and n. 3); yet later he told Warburton that Jervas was proud of having completed "the translation of Don Quixote without Spanish" (see Johnson's life of Pope, Lives of the English Poets , ed. George Birkbeck Hill [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1905], 3: 107 n. 3; however, Hill's reference [Warburton, Works (1811), 7: 232 n.] is inaccurate.) In a note to his revision of Motteux, Ozell praised the accuracy of Jarvis's translation, remarking cryptically that it was " supervis'd by the learn'd and polite Dr. O---d, and Mr. P---" (7th edition [1743], 4: 238 n.). In his Life of Samuel Johnson Sir John Hawkins asserted on the authority of a friend of Tonson the publisher, that the translation appearing under Jarvis's name was actually the work of Thomas Broughton (1704-74), reader at the Temple church and the author of miscellaneous works (2nd edition [1787], p. 216). 57 Edwin B. Knowles, "A Note on Smollett's Don Quixote ," Modern Language Quarterly , 16 (1955), 29-31. 58 Linsalata's references are to Cervantes, El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha , trans. Francisco Rodríguez Marín, 8 vols. (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, S.A., 1928); and to the translations of Jarvis, 2 vols. (1742) and Smollett, 2 vols. (1755). 59 Lund, "From Oblivion to Dulness: Pope and the Poetics of Appropriation," British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies , 14 (1991), 171-89. 60 This virtue of Jarvis's translation was immediately acknowledged by Ozell, who, in a footnote in the 7th edition (1743) of his revision of Motteux, owned that he admired Jarvis's work "for it's Accuracy" (4: 96 n.). 61 See John Orr, "Did Smollett Know Spanish?" Modern Language Review , 45 (1950), 218. 62 Recorded in full in his dissertation (Appendix A), Linsalata's 472 examples together comprise 56,250 words of the novel's 401,000 words--or 14 per cent of the text, excluding Smollett's footnotes. 63 Windham, Remarks , p. 17; Griffiths, Monthly Review , 13 (1755), 197. 64 Quoted in Lewis Melville, The Life and Letters of Tobias Smollett (1721-1771) (London, 1926), p. 121. 65 For Hannay's opinion, see his Life of Tobias George Smollett (London, 1887), p. 137. For Rodríguez Marín's, see Cordasco, Modern Language Quarterly , 13 (1952), 36 n. 60. 66 Both volumes of the 1673 edition (1: sig. ††2 v ; 2: sig. *8 v ) carry the notice that on 5 September 1669 the heirs of Juan Mommarte transferred the rights to the Brussels edition to Geronymo and Juanbautista Verdussen. Of this text only the three editions cited above include the spelling "Cetina" followed by Smollett. All three of these editions also lack the phrase "dixo el Cura" found in Pineda ed. (I.iv.37; 2: 146) and followed by Jarvis, "said the priest" (I.iv. 10; 1: 250), but omitted by Smollett. In the present essay quotations from the original are from the 1697 Antwerp edition. 67 Ormsby, trans., 1: 53. 68 There is little evidence that Smollett used Pineda's Nuevo Dicionario (London, 1740), also in Spanish and English. The great majority of Pineda's entries are taken verbatim from Stevens. It is possible, however, that Smollett's note defining " Salpicon " as "cold beef sliced" was suggested by Pineda's definition "cold beef cut in slices" (Stevens has "pieces"); and that his explanation of " Mosqueo " as signifying "flagellation at the cart's tail" was also suggested by Pineda, who alone offers a similar alternative definition and cites the specific passage in question: "a Whipping by the Minister of Justice; vid. Quix . vol . 2. cap . 35." For these references in Smollett, see I.i.1; 1: 1 n. and II.iii.3; 2: 226 n.. 69 See Cordasco, MLQ, 13 (1952), 24. 70 Remarks , p. 30. 71 See Morgan's Complete History , 2 vols. (1728-29), 2: 563-65. 72 Smollett's Hoax , Appendix C, and p. 69 n. 73 In the original the housekeeper, not well read in romances, mishears aventuras (adventures) as venturas (good luck), and, well aware that Don Quixote has invariably returned from his sallies abroad in a miserable state, is puzzled by what she has heard. Smollett in the first edition has the housekeeper say that her master plans to go "'searching up and down the world for what he calls ventures, tho' I cannot imagine why they should have that name . . .'" (II.i.7; 2: 35). In the 2nd edition, misled by Jarvis's translation and note, Smollett substituted "adventures" for "ventures", and repeated Jarvis's explanation: "The original, ventura , signifies good luck as well as adventures" (3: 51 n.). 74 See the following notes: I.iii.13; 1: 181 n. [on "Bamba or Wamba"]; I.iv.14; 1: 322 n. [on "Cava or Caba"]; II.iv.10; 2: 396 n. [on "Michael Scot"]; and, added in the 2nd edition, II.i.3 [on "Alphonsus Tostatus"]. 75 Smollett to Huggins ( 7 December 1756); Knapp, ed.

      <field name="heading_text">ATTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHORSHIP IN THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE , 1849-68, AND ADDENDA, 1733-1838: A SUPPLEMENT TO KUIST by EMILY LORRAINE DE MONTLUZIN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following is the sixth installment in my series of articles designed to expand and correct James M. Kuist's The Nichols File of The Gentleman's Magazine: Attributions of Authorship and Other Documentation in Editorial Papers at the Folger Library (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1982). As students of the Gentleman's Magazine and of its long-time editor, John Nichols, are aware, Kuist's Nichols File has provided researchers in the field of eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century British press history with an indispensable reference consisting of a published list of nearly 13,000 attributions of authorship of hitherto anonymous letters, articles, reviews, and poems appearing in the Gentleman's Magazine from its beginning in 1731 through 1856, the year the Nichols family relinquished ownership of the magazine over whose fortunes it had presided for three generations. Kuist's Nichols File is, however, designedly limited in scope, as Kuist made the conscious decision to confine his attributions of authorship to the marginal annotations written by John Bowyer Nichols 1 and others of his family into the staff copy of the GM (now housed in the Folger Library) when they reconstructed their office files following a disastrous fire in 1808. Despite the best efforts of the annotators, a tremendous number of attributions went unrecorded, some because they eluded detection, some through haste or carelessness, and some simply because their authors' identities seemed so obvious at the time that no one bothered to write them down. Fortunately thousands of the gaps can be filled, thanks to lists of known pseudonyms and sets of initials provided in Kuist's own index and in studies of the early years of the Magazine , 2 information supplied in the GM 's obituary columns and in contemporary memoirs, leads provided by Kuist's Catalogue II (with its listing of unpublished letters, manuscript articles, and other documents housed in the Nichols File), and persistent detective work involving the unscrambling of anagrams and the matching of authors with the towns and sometimes street addresses whence they wrote.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The present article undertakes to update Kuist's Nichols File by providing, first, 320 new or corrected attributions of authorship representing 121 contributors and covering the period from 1849 through May 1868, when the Gentleman's Magazine 's new management changed its character so drastically as to alter it beyond all recognition. The article thus serves as a conclusion to my five companion-piece installments, "Attributions of Authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine , 1731-77: A Supplement to Kuist," Studies in Bibliography 44 (1991): 271-302; "Attributions of Authorship… , 1778-92… ," Studies in Bibliography 45 (1992): 158-187; "Attributions of Authorship… , 1793-1808… ," Studies in Bibliography 46 (1993): 320-349; "Attributions of Authorship… , 1809-26… ," Studies in Bibliography 47 (1994): 164-195; and "Attributions of Authorship… , 1827-48… ," Studies in Bibliography 49 (1996): 176-207 3 . In addition, as I have been able in seven years of study of the Gentleman's Magazine to expand and refine my methods of identifying anonymous or pseudonymous authors, I am including by way of addenda 271 supplementary attributions of authorship representing 85 contributors and spanning the period from 1733 through 1838. Those 271 attributions, made after the installments in which they would have appeared were already in print, I have hereby appended in order to make the record as complete as possible and therefore of maximum usefulness to researchers. Taken collectively my six-part series of articles has thus added nearly 4,000 new or corrected attributions of authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine to the approximately 13,000 items catalogued by Kuist in The Nichols File .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mechanics in this article remain the same as those used in the five previous installments. All finds are cross-listed, with each item appearing in both the appropriate Chronological Listing and Synopsis by Contributor. The Chronological Listings, which utilize short titles, employ the following designations: L: letter to Sylvanus Urban A: article, note, or query (including "Minor Correspondence" items) R: review V: poetry O: obituary S: staff item of editorial content As in previous installments the Chronological Listings provide in brackets the source of each attribution of authorship, the abbreviation "Sig." designating items assigned on the basis of known pseudonyms or initials, especially when the incidence of place-names corroborates the attributions. As usual, pairs of contributors who were father and son are designated by the abbreviations "Eld." or "Yngr.," and the two G. Smiths who wrote for the Magazine in its early years are differentiated as "George Smith of York" and "G. Smith of Wigton [Cumbria]." Full names of authors (plus birth and death dates when available) appear in the Synopses by Contributor.

      <field name="fulltext">The Gentleman's Magazine in its mid-nineteenth-century incarnation was quite a different animal from the periodical that had appeared under Edward Cave's direction a century and a quarter before. As noted in the preceding installment, the Magazine had already begun to display subtle differences in style and content after the inauguration of a new series in 1834. Those differences in the Magazine intensified in early 1850, when contributions signed with initials and pseudonyms virtually disappeared except for the Minor Correspondence section; and in the mid 1860's the pace of change became precipitous. The Nichols family had of course already sold the Magazine in 1856, and J. H. Parker (John Gough Nichols's successor as editor) gave up his duties in 1865. The latest publishers (Bradbury, Evans, and Co.) launched a second new series (commencing with Vol. 220 for January-June 1866) with the sanguine promise that the GM would maintain its strength in antiquarian matters, cover a more diverse array of subjects in book reviews, reserve considerably more space for contemporary literature, and do an even better job in recording births, marriages, obituaries, and appointments. Furthermore, the conductors assured their readers, "'Sylvanus Urban' also desires to lay open his columns much more extensively… to Original Correspondence, especially in matters of genealogy, topography, heraldry, local antiquities, personal and family history, folk-lore, philology, etc."(220 [1866]: v).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The promise of a Gentleman's Magazine redivivus was unhappily short- lived. After a five- volume run, the second new series came to an end and with it any attempt to restore the Magazine to even a semblance of its old character. Vol. 225 (June-November 1868) ushered in a third new series, under the direction of a different editor (Joseph Hatton) and at the reduced price of 1 s. in place of half a crown. Calling the GM "one of the institutions of the country" (225 [1868]: 1), the new management in its "Preface" to readers gamely tried to evoke the mystique of Samuel Johnson and Edward Cave and capitalize on the Magazine 's venerable past, a past of which it was clearly in awe. True, the "Preface" acknowledged, the Gentleman's Magazine would be abandoning any further attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of "Politics, Science, Art," the parliamentary debates, literary criticism, or the activities of the learned societies, as "[i]t is no longer desirable, it is indeed scarcely possible, for a monthly magazine to comprise the features" to which the GM 's old audience had been accustomed (2). Readers, however, could rest assured that, as always, the staff would accept unsolicited contributions and attempt to find a place for them in the GM 's pages. "The new number… is another link in the long chain that reaches back to 'Edward Cave at St. John's Gate,'" Hatton asserted. "We give up no jot of the Urbanian Succesion…" (2). But to anyone familiar with the Magazine in its heyday the new management's attempt to affect the persona of Sylvanus Urban seems self-conscious, awkward, and uncomfortably anachronistic, as if the GM 's mid-Victorian editor had unsuccessfully dressed himself in borrowed robes. In the course of the following two volumes (226-227) Hatton dropped all pretense of emulating the gracious old magazine in which eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century readers had delighted, abruptly withdrawing the welcome he had extended to unsolicited letters and articles (those mainstays of the old Magazine ) and jettisoning the obituaries for once and for all. Clearly with the commencement of the third new series in mid 1868 the Gentleman's Magazine became an entirely different entity, a thing that Edward Cave, Samuel Johnson, David Henry, John Hawkesworth, Richard Gough, John Nichols, John Bowyer Nichols, and their readers and contributors would not even have recognized. It is a sad conclusion for anyone who (like John Goodford in 1824 4 ) would sign himself</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Foundation of "Philosophical Criticism": William Taylor's Initial Connection with the Monthly Review, 1792-93 by DAVID CHANDLER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his portrait of Francis Jeffrey in The Spirit of the Age (London, 1825), Hazlitt reviewed what seemed to him the principal advance in periodical criticism of the Romantic Period: We do not implicitly bow to the political opinions, nor to the critical decisions of the Edinburgh Review ; but we must do justice to the talent with which they are supported, and to the tone of manly explicitness in which they are delivered. They are eminently characteristic of the Spirit of the Age. . . . The Edinburgh Review stands upon the ground of opinion; it asserts the supremacy of intellect: the pre-eminence it claims is from an acknowledged superiority of talent and information and literary attainment, and it does not build one tittle of its influence on ignorance, or prejudice, or authority, or personal malevolence. It takes up a question, and argues it pro and con with great knowledge and boldness and skill. . . . (307-308) In respect of this criticism, "eminently characteristic of the Spirit of the Age" (and, one might add, prophetic of much subsequent critical endeavour), Hazlitt added a significant footnote: The style of philosophical criticism, which has been the boast of the Edinburgh Review, was first introduced into the Monthly Review about the year 1796, in a series of articles by Mr. William Taylor, of Norwich. (308) Born in 1778, Hazlitt seems, understandably enough, to have misdated Taylor's connection with the Monthly Review (hereafter MR ). As will be shown, Taylor had been a regular contributor as early as 1793; moreover there is no significant change in his critical method between then and 1799, when he stopped writing for the periodical for several years. It may, of course, have been around 1796 that Taylor's distinctive voice first began to be singled out from the MR 's anonymous pages, despite the attempts of the editor, Ralph Griffiths, to prune Taylor's stylistic idiosyncrasies. 1 But what is important is that in Hazlitt's astute estimation Taylor had anticipated "the Spirit of the Age" nearly a decade before that "Spirit" became more broadly manifest in the Edinburgh Review (founded in 1802). It seems remarkable, given this, that no study of Taylor's criticism exists; the object of the present article is not to remedy the deficiency, but to trace the circumstances of Taylor's initial connection with the MR , of which only misleading accounts exist. This, it is hoped, will supply a sound bibliographical basis for subsequent work on Taylor as a critic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A clear understanding of the circumstances of Taylor's connection with the MR depends to a certain extent on some knowledge of his background, so I give first a brief account of this. The early part of Taylor's life reveals a familiar conflict between parental ambition and personal inclination. 2 Born in Norwich in 1765, Taylor was the only child of a wealthy Norwich textile merchant with an extensive export business. He was brought up with a view to becoming useful in the business, from an early age being tutored in several European languages. The years 1774 to 1779 he spent at Mrs Barbauld's boarding school at Palgrave, Norfolk; he later described the prominent Unitarian Barbauld as "the Mother of his mind" (Robberds, I, 8). She was a major literary figure and there was a strong literary bias to the school's activities that gave Taylor a prolonged glimpse of his later métier. 3 Here, too, he made an important friend in the literary-minded Frank Sayers (1763-1817) (Taylor, I, x). Between 1779 and the end of 1782 Taylor was sent on two long continental tours with a view to his improvement in the relevant languages and to acquaint him with trade. The second tour included a year spent in the small German town of Detmold, where Taylor mastered German, probably the most important event of his intellectual life. Here he was befriended by Lorenz Benzler (1747-1827), a minor literary figure who encouraged Taylor's interest in German literature and introduced him to the work of major contemporary German writers. From 1783 Taylor ostensibly worked for his father but devoted much of his (seemingly extensive) leisure to literary pursuits (Taylor, I, xix). He became devoted to political reform and had an extremely tolerant view of religious differences: although continuing to worship as a Unitarian, he appears to have been essentially a Deist. He was in good company; as historians have noted, there was a liberal atmosphere in Norwich at this time, with Dissenters playing a prominent role in municipal affairs. 4 There was also a real interest in intellectual enquiry among the Norwich intelligentsia, many of whom regularly met at Taylor's family home, and against such a background Taylor, attracted to argument and new ideas, flourished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having come of age in 1786, Taylor began to take a more active role in city affairs. In 1788 he served on the committee of a Norwich organisation devoted to the abolition of the Slave Trade ( Norfolk Chronicle , 6 December 1788). The following year he was an active supporter of the campaign to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, and in 1790 he helped form the Norwich Revolution Society, subsequently conducting the Society's correspondence. Taylor's interest in literature continued; he had probably begun writing verse at Palgrave, 5 and by 1788 he was writing highly accomplished poetry. 6 Since 1783 he had translated extracts from German literature for Sayers' benefit (Taylor, I, xix); towards the end of the decade he embarked on an ambitious translation of Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris (Robberds, I, 112). In 1790 he made a second major translation, that of Lessing's Nathan der Weisse (preface to published edition, 1805). In the same year, having paid a devotee's visit to revolutionary France, he published a series of political letters in the Cambridge Chronicle over the signature "A Friend to Liberty". 7 The general tenor of these letters was opposition to the tyranny of systems; "[the] reasonable man", wrote Taylor, "is resolved to trust implicitly to no priest or party, but to the best of his abilities to search after the truth and act accordingly." This was obviously a sound basis for the "philosophical criticism" that he was to develop over the following decade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the end of 1789 Taylor's friend Sayers decided to devote himself to literature, abandoning an abortive career in medicine (Taylor, I, xxxvii-xxxix). He immediately began writing a striking series of dramas in something like the style of Mason; the following year they were published by Joseph Johnson as Dramatic Sketches of the Ancient Northern Mythology . This volume established Sayers' reputation in both Britain and Germany and its relative success, according to Robberds, inspired Taylor to contemplate a literary career too (I, 81). Robberds explained that Taylor used the unrest caused by the French Revolution to lever his father out of trade: About this time [1790] the troubles of the French Revolution threatened to disturb the commercial relations of the Continent. The consequent decline of the Norwich trade furnished a powerful argument of which he [Taylor] availed himself to persuade his father to concur with him in withdrawing their capital from operations that appeared likely to become both irksome and hazardous. . . . The course which he recommended was pursued. In the year 1791 they dissolved their partnership with Mr. Casenave. Their joint property appeared adequate to afford them the comforts and even the elegances of private life, and they retired from the cares of business to possess and secure to themselves these enjoyments. . . . being thus set at liberty to follow the bent of his own inclinations, William Taylor devoted himself thenceforth exclusively to literature. (I, 85-86) This account is misleading, as will be shown. Robberds, unfortunately, only knew Taylor after the turn of the century; for the earlier part of the latter's life he relied heavily on the not very precise reminiscences of Taylor's cousin, Thomas Dyson (1769-1849) (Robberds, I, 2-3). The problem with the above chronology is that he leaves an awkard gap between 1791, when Taylor allegedly began his literary career, and the latter half of 1793 when he became a regular writer for the MR . Separate evidence allows us to place a translation of several of Wieland's Göttergespräche and a parody of Samuel Butler's Hudibras in this period, but collectively these show that Taylor wrote less in 1791-92 than in 1790, before his supposed adoption of a literary career. 8 Robberds certainly failed to appreciate the difficulty of a disengagement from a business as extensive as the Taylors', however. Furthermore, it seems certain that the elder Taylor needed to be convinced of the need for such a disengagement on the grounds of prudency, and these were unlikely to be evident as early as 1790. C. B. Jewson, the historian of Norwich in this period, states that it was not until early in 1791 that events on the continent provoked any commercial anxiety in Norwich ( The Jacobin City [Glasgow, 1975], 25); fear of trade becoming actually "irksome and hazardous" would have been later, and J. K. Edwards, who has studied the Norwich trade at this period finds no evidence of "decline" "at least until 1792" ("The Decline of the Norwich Textiles Industry", Yorkshire Bulletin of Economic and Social Research , 16 [1964], 31-41). This suggests that Robberds' dates should be moved forward at least a year, pointing to a more coherent chronology. There can be little doubt that from 1783, if not earlier, Taylor was more interested in literature than trade, but the latter allowed a prosperous style of living and ample leisure, while he must have realised the uncertainty attached to any attempt at a professional literary career.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his study of the MR during this period, Benjamin Christie Nangle cites Robberds' account of Taylor's early involvement with the periodical without questioning its authority ( The Monthly Review Second Series, 1790-1815 [Oxford, 1955], 66-67). According to Robberds the connection began when Taylor submitted, via William Enfield (1741-97; dean of Norwich literati and a regular contributor to the MR since 1774), an apparently unsolicited review of Sayers' second major work, Disquisitions Metaphysical and Literary : through his [Enfield's] agency William Taylor's connection with that publication [the MR ] was first brought about. The primitiæ artis of the latter were consecrated on the altar of friendship; the earliest trial of his skill in criticism was made on the 'Disquisitions' of Dr. Sayers, of which work his review, or rather his panegyric, was inserted in the Monthly Review for April 1793. In the following summer [that of 1793], Dr. Enfield, contemplating an absence of several weeks from Norwich, transferred the books, which had been sent for his perusal and judgement, to William Taylor, who was then formally introduced to Dr. Griffiths and brought into direct communication with him. (I, 121) Robberds published a letter from Griffiths to Taylor of 27 June 1793, "mark[ing] the commencement of this intercourse" (I, 122). The vexing aspect of Nangle's acceptance of this account is that he attributes three earlier reviews in the MR to Taylor, one as early as October 1790, the others of March 1792 and February 1793. Interestingly, the first two were again of works by Sayers, the first of Dramatic Sketches , the second of Poems (really a revised second edition of Dramatic Sketches with some shorter works added). As these attributions are taken from Griffiths' own, marked copy of the MR (now preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford), they merit serious attention, suggesting confusion in Robberds' account.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first of these earlier reviews (N.S. 3, 140-147) proves on closer inspection, however, not to be Taylor's. In the Bodleian copy it can be seen that Griffiths had originally marked it "Anon." (147); another hand has subsequently added "Taylor 1 st Art." Although the review is both long and, in many respects, approving, there is a coolness of tone that Taylor certainly would not have applied to his closest friend's first published work (a comparison with his later reviews of Sayers' works is revealing in this respect). He would not have stated "There are, in all these plays, many imperfect lines, and some other symptoms of hasty composition" (146), neither would he have pointed out errors in Sayers' notes on Scandinavian mythology when he could--if he had such information--have so easily set Sayers right prior to the latter's publication. Moreover the mistake is readily explicable. The 1792 review (N.S. 7, 331-332), marked by Griffiths "Anon:--D r . E's friend" (332), almost certainly is Taylor's work (as Nangle assumed), and thence, by extension, almost certainly his first published review. Griffiths clearly understood that it had come via Enfield, and other manuscript evidence, to be considered shortly, points to Taylor as the writer. The review contains just the sort of energetic praise we would expect --"they [Sayers dramas] abound with efforts of the lyric kind, which, in our language, have seldom been excelled" (331)--moreover it contains recondite information, not in the text, that only an acquaintance of the author is likely to have known; for example (commenting on Sayers' "Pandora"): "The story of Pandora had already been given, as a monodrama, by the inferior hand of Count Pepoli." Stylistically, too, the review seems to be Taylor's. It seems probable, then, that the 1790 review was mistakenly marked as Taylor's "1 st Art." by someone who had heard (correctly) that Taylor's reviewing career began with a review of Sayers' Dramatic Sketches .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fortunately, Enfield's extant correspondence with Griffiths, preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS. Add. C.89, ff.53-100 v ), allows the circumstances developing from the 1792 review to be filled in with reasonable detail. Enfield's covering letter for the review is not preserved, but it is clear that Griffiths was impressed by the unsolicited contribution, and that he enquired of Enfield regarding Taylor's availability for other reviewing work. All this is implied in the postscript of a letter of Enfield to Griffiths dated 21 February 1792: I have not yet had an opportunity of speaking to the reviewer of D r . Sayer [ sic ]: but am afraid he is a man (though better qualified for the task than almost any person I know) too busy, and too independent, to become a reviewer ex officio . (f.64) 9 This must refer to someone who Enfield knew in Norwich, and Enfield's subsequent letters to Griffiths make it all but certain that "the reviewer" was Taylor. This, then, effectively confirms Taylor's authorship of the 1792 review and again suggests that it was his first. Interesting here is the reference to Taylor's being "too busy" for regular employment, as within eighteen months or so he had indeed become a reviewer ex officio ". This must allude to his mercantile activities. Whether the business was still functioning normally, or whether it was in the process of being wound up (as seems possible), it was clearly allowing Taylor limited leisure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Griffiths seems to have instructed Enfield to keep Taylor interested, for in a fragment of a letter dated April 1792 Enfield reported: "I have prevailed upon my friend M r W. Taylor jun r . occasionally to undertake an article for the R." He then enlarged on Taylor's suitability: He is a man of extensive knowledge, great ability, and sound judgment, but he has too many engagements, &amp; [is] in too independent a situation to become a regular in our corps. He is exceedingly well acquainted with the German Language as well as French, and frequently procures books in both languages, particularly the German of which he is very fond. If you send him any capital German work either literary or philosophical, or give me your instructions to desire him to chuse one for himself, you will I dare say find him a valuable assistant for the R. (f.55) Despite the promising tone of this, neither Griffiths or Taylor seems to have made any immediate move to consolidate the latter's connection with the MR . Thus on 11 July we find Enfield returning Griffiths some "foreign books" that he felt unable to review and repeating his recommendation of Taylor: When I first received these books I had an idea that you intended them for M r . Taylor: but as he is a man of business and of numerous engagements he would not, I am sure, undertake any thing but at his own leisure, at the same time he is a man of such extensive knowledge and uncommon talents, that I am persuaded, an occasional article from his pen would do great credit to the review. Some work of science, or taste, which has superior merit, you will perhaps soon have an opportunity of sending him; if you can, let it be a German work, as he is well read in that language. (ff.65-65 v ) Again, however, there was no movement on either side, and on 6 December Enfield reminded Griffiths: "You have not yet sent any foreign article for Mr. Taylor" (f.66).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The impression one gets from this correspondence is that Taylor was still very much involved in business in 1792, and far from committed to a literary career. Had he been so, one imagines he would have made a determined effort to consolidate the favourable impression his review of Sayers' Poems had made on Griffiths. Griffiths, on the other hand, was apparently reluctant to accept Taylor as a merely dilettante contributor. Certainly it appears that he felt there was no immediate vacancy for a reviewer of German material (see below). Enfield seems during the latter half of 1792 to have been more eager to establish the connection than either of the main parties concerned. We can pause here to consider his motives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enfield had been a friend of Griffiths for many years, and the two men seem to have had the highest respect and affection for each other. Enfield, indeed, towards the end of his life, was able to compare the friendship to a marriage: "I consider ourselves as bound to one another, like man and wife" (f.100). Enfield's devotion to the success of the MR is thus not surprising, but his political radicalism meant that he was prepared to tolerate no compromise in the periodical's traditional liberal ideology. Among several similar passages in his correspondence with Griffiths, the following, included in a letter of 5 August 1791, admirably demonstrates Enfield's belief that the MR could, and should, play a valuable part in the liberal crusade: I cannot help expressing to you the great pleasure with which I perused many articles in the last number. Better things have seldom been said on the great subjects now before the public than are to be found in this R. Independent of every idea of personal advantage, it must I am sure be a great pleasure to you to contribute so largely towards enlightening the public. And still alas! if we may judge from what has lately happened [Enfield alludes to the Birmingham riots of the previous month], there is much need of illumination. There is still a thick cloud of bigotry, and a yet thicker of dishonesty, to be dispersed. (ff.60-60 v ) Though Enfield must have realised that not all his fellow contributors conceived of the radical potential of the review in the way he did (see below), Taylor, not only with impeccable radical credentials, but superbly well read and a personal friend, must have appealed as perfectly fitted to battle against "bigotry" and "dishonesty" in the MR , just as he had done previously in the Cambridge Chronicle . Enfield's persistence in calling Griffiths' attention to Taylor is thus explicable as a combination of personal, literary, and political factors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seems to have been late in 1792, or early the following year, that Taylor supplied a second "occasional article", this time a review, perhaps surprisingly, of Joseph Ritson's edition of Ancient Songs, from the time of King Henry the Third to the Revolution (1792). There is no record of the review being sent, but it was published in the February MR (N.S. 10, 178-182), is marked "T--y----r*" in the Bodleian copy, with "*of Norwich" added below, and in a letter to Griffiths of 13 March 1793 Enfield stated "M r . Taylor is very happy in your approbation of his article of Ritson " (f.71 v ). Griffiths' "approbation" is hardly surprising as the review is a performance of easy competence and obvious learning. It would be interesting to know more than we do of the relations between Griffiths and Taylor at this juncture, and thus whether Griffiths had solicited the review. Prima facie it does not appear to have been the sort of work that Enfield was encouraging Griffiths to supply Taylor with, but his extant correpondence with Griffiths is by no means complete, and the review itself demonstrates how capable Taylor was of handling such material. It is worth noting that Enfield had clearly been varying his suggestions, proposing first a "literary or philosophical work", later a work of "science, or taste", and given that no German work was forthcoming, he may have pointed out Taylor's competence in other areas. Interestingly, Taylor shortly afterwards reviewed an earlier work of Ritson's, Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry (1791). The considerable delay in the appearance of a review of this work may suggest that Griffiths had previously been unable to find a reviewer with the requisite specialist knowledge. 10 If he now discovered that Taylor had such knowledge, he may have offered him the later work as a means of ascertaining his competence; at this stage there seems to have been no question of Taylor being paid. A case may be made either way, but from this time it is certain that Griffiths approached Taylor with material of this type. Enfield's letter of 13 March continued: he [Taylor] will undertake the Scotch Songs, and you may occasionally send him through me any work that you think will suit him--concerning schemes on your part I have no commission to say anything-- What Griffiths' "schemes" were can only be speculated, but the suggestion is that they related to Taylor's regular employment as a reviewer. At this date a sort of half-way stage seems to have been reached, Enfield continuing to act as intermediary. Taylor must have accepted both John Pinkerton's Scotish [ sic ] Poems (1792) and Ritson's Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry at this juncture. These were the same sort of work as the Ancient Songs and this may well imply, as suggested above, that Griffiths was looking for a specialist in this area.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the beginning of March, meanwhile, Taylor submitted a review that was certainly not solicited. On 1 March Enfield wrote to Griffiths: "I send you a volunteer article of M r Taylor on his friend D r Sayers' Essays [ Disquisitions Metaphysical and Literary ]. It is a tribute of friendship, but I think a very fair one" (f.70) (this was the review that Robberds considered to be Taylor's first). This was Taylor's second "tribute of friendship", and Griffiths was normally opposed to such potentially partisan reviewing; perhaps that explains why Taylor, although once again strongly approving, did attempt a more impartial tone. Perhaps, too, he was now thinking of a serious commitment to the MR and wanted further to consolidate his reputation with Griffiths. As Robberds notes, the review was published in the April MR (N.S. 10, 373-377). Along with the review Enfield sent Griffiths a copy of the Disquisitions and suggested that Sayers, too, might "become a valuable addition to your corps". Sayers' review of Joseph Priestley's Letters to the Philosophers and Politicians of France on the subject of Religion subsequently appeared in the MR for June 1793 (N.S. 11, 229-230), but by 5 May Enfield had decided that Sayers was probably "too indolent to be a very regular reviewer" (f.73 v ). (Sayers, indeed, seems only to have undertaken one subsequent review for Griffiths.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 5 May it was Enfield's turn to supply a "tribute of friendship". He wrote to Griffiths: The article of Iphigenia in Tauris I send as a tribute of our valuable friend M r . Taylor. The translation is his, and I think I am not blinded by friendship when I say that it deserves all the praise that I have bestowed upon it. . . . You will give it so early an admission as your other engagements will permit. (f.73) Taylor's translation of Iphigenie auf Tauris had been completed in 1790; his choosing finally to publish it in Spring 1793 must reflect his increasingly serious literary ambitions. The publication may also have been a politic move aimed at Griffiths, who had not yet allowed Taylor to demonstrate his prime strength in the field of German literature. In the event the publication probably had the additional significance, by its almost complete commercial failure, of proving to Taylor the necessity of a regular connection with a periodical if he were to pursue a living with his pen. 11 In this regard it is noteworthy that Taylor did not bother publishing his other major translation of 1790, that of Lessing's Nathan der Weise , until 1805.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the letter of 5 May Enfield noted that he was enclosing "M r . T's articles". This must refer to the review of Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry which, like Enfield's review of Iphigenia in Tauris , was fitted into the May issue of the MR (N.S. 11, 72-77 and 51-59 respectively), and that of Scotish Poems which appeared in the June issue (N.S. 11, 172-176). Intriguingly it may also refer to a review of a rather different kind of work: William Belsham's Remarks on the Nature and Necessity of Parliamentary Reform (1793). A review of this pamphlet, marked "Tay----r of Nor----h" in the Bodleian copy, appeared in the Appendix to Volume 10 (January-April 1793), apparently published at the same time as the May issue (N.S. 10, 577-580). 12 There is, unfortunately, no mention of this review in the extant Enfield correspondence. As Enfield would have known, Taylor was extremely interested in parliamentary reform--in the review he refers to it as "the most interesting of subjects"--and well qualified to tackle such works along lines that Enfield would approve. 13 As this was the first of Taylor's many reviews of political works it would be particularly interesting to know whether it was solicited or unsolicited, but no certain evidence points either way. On balance, however, it seems unlikely that Taylor, who in this case can have had no privileged early access to the book, would have risked encroaching on a regular reviewer's territory. Two years later, when Taylor sent him an unsolicited review, Griffiths was forced to refuse it because the work had already been given to somebody else; on that occasion he warned: "My reviewing friends always run a great hazard of losing their labour, when they voluntarily, and without previously acquainting the conducter, undertake an unconsigned article" (Robberds, I, 134). The Belsham piece certainly proved Taylor's value as a political reviewer. Of his three reviews in the July MR , two are of political works, the anonymous Thoughts on the Causes of the Present Failures and Thomas Paine's Prospects on the War and Paper Currency (N.S. 11, 334-335 and 335-337 respectively), while in the August issue he was allowed considerably more space to review Robert Hall's Apology for the Freedom of the Press and for General Liberty (N.S. 11, 380-384). None of these are mentioned in the Enfield correspondence, but it is inconceivable that Griffiths was not soliciting them. A possible explanation of why such works were now offered to Taylor can be found in the subsequent letter from Griffiths of 27 June; Griffiths stated that he was no longer sending political works to Arthur Murphy, because of the latter's "violent attachment to aristocracy" (Robberds, I, 123). At a time of acute political tension the liberal Griffiths, with the support of Enfield, could only preserve a uniformity of sentiment in the MR --something he cherished--by winnowing out the more conservative voices. Along with the increase in politically orientated publications, this would have created space for a new, politically "safe" reviewing voice like Taylor's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The third of the July reviews, that of the anonymous Stone Henge: A Poem (1792), clearly identified as Taylor's in the Bodleian copy, is a different case (N.S. 11, 344-345). There seems no good reason for Griffiths' sending Taylor this obscure and second-rate work, apparently published as early as May 1792. Clearly there had been some new initiative to get the work reviewed, for the Critical Review for July, and the British Critic for August 1793, both carried very brief notices. Taylor's longer notice can perhaps be explained by the fact that the poem was by John Wagstaffe (1726?-1808), a minor Norwich poet patronised by Edward Jerningham; quite possibly Taylor took the initiative in endeavouring to attract notice to a work that had previously received little or none. 14</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Robberds recorded, Enfield was absent from Norwich for a considerable part of the Summer of 1793. On 6 June he wrote to Griffiths that he was going on a tour of the Lakes: "We set out on Midsummers day, &amp; shall be absent six weeks" (f.76). But Robberds seems to have been mistaken in supposing that there was any significant transference of books. In the letter quoted, Enfield expressly stated his determination to complete all his outstanding work for the MR before he left, and there is no obvious increase in Taylor's contributions in the following months. Robberds' sole evidence was probably the letter he prints from Griffiths to Taylor of 27 June, where it is mentioned that Enfield had "turned over" to Taylor "one or two . . . pamphlets" (I, 123); his misrepresentation of this can probably be accounted for by his clear ignorance of the extent to which Taylor had already become an independent contributor. Before he left, Enfield dispatched a parcel to Griffiths that, along with his own reviews, contained "articles concerning Hall, Paine, Owen and Barry" by Taylor (Robberds, I, 124). As noted already, only the Paine review found its way into the July MR ; the Hall review appeared in August, "Owen and Barry" in September. Presumably the reviews of Thoughts on . . . the Present Failures and Stone Henge had already been dispatched. Of the other works, William Owen's translation of The Heroic Elegies and other Pieces of Llywarc Hen (1792) (N.S. 12, 18-22), which again seems to have appeared belatedly, was an obvious title for the reviewer of Ritson and Pinkerton, while James Barry's Letter to . . . the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce (N.S. 12, 23-28) had a pronounced political aspect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The twelve reviews detailed so far seem to have comprised the extent of Taylor's gratuitous reviewing for the MR . They can be classified into three types: the unsolicited notices of Sayers and the probably volunteered one of Wagstaffe; the reviews of works under the rubric "old British poetry"; the reviews of works concerned with the contemporary political scene. It may seem odd, after Enfield's recommendations, that there is no "foreign article" in this list, but Griffiths was almost certainly wary of offending regular members of his "corps" who normally handled this area. Taylor's first review of a German publication appeared in the Appendix to Volume 11 (May-August 1793) and detailed an obviously peripheral work, Johann Hinrich Röding's Allgemeines Wörterbuch der Marine (1793), Taylor, however, demonstrated a surprising knowledge of its rather specialised subject matter (N.S. 11, 563-565). Possibly this was unsolicited. It was not until September 1794 that Taylor's second review of a German work (a translation of Herrmann von Unna ) appeared, but thereafter he regularly handled German material.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The principal effect of Enfield's absence was to force Griffiths into direct communication with Taylor for the first time. This began with his letter of 27 June, already quoted from. The letter concluded: I am happy, Sir, in this occasion of commencing a correspondence with a gentleman of your character and abilities . . . I see with pleasure that I am getting into your debt, and I trust that you will not find me altogether ungrateful for the obligation. . . (Robberds, I, 123-124) Taylor replied on 12 July: I am obliged by what you hint of a remuneration. I have no objection to accept it. My bookseller's bills may as well be paid by literary labour as by those of the counting-house. But I must decline all recompense, unless I can retain the entire liberty of refusing at any time every book to which I may happen to feel disinclined, or to think myself unequal. By these means we shall both feel at ease. (Robberds, I, 124-125)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is a revealing letter, demonstrating yet again that Robberds vastly oversimplified Taylor's transition from merchant to professional man of letters. By this time Taylor must have realised that there was very little money to be made from translations like Iphigenia in Tauris , and his somewhat cavalier attitude towards "remuneration" from Griffiths suggests no desire for a professional dependence on his writing. The reference to work in "the counting-house" contradicts Robberds' supposition that the Taylors quickly withdrew from all their business interests, and that the younger Taylor made an immediate transition to literature. Later in the decade Taylor certainly did take a pride in being able to live off his earnings as a writer (with the supplement, it must be added, of an income from some earlier investments). 15 On 1 November he wrote to Robert Southey: Since the expense for education ceased, I never had a guinea from my family in any other form than share of board; and I wish never to make any requests, which should constitute an obligation on my part to attend to prudential advice about this or that offer of partnership in a banker's or merchant's counting-house. (Robberds, I, 307) But in Summer 1793 Taylor clearly lacked any notion of his writing supplying a sufficient recompense to allow him an adequate independent income. It was perhaps the fact that Griffiths accepted the terms set out in his letter of 12 July, and that from then on he was paid, that alerted Taylor to the possibility. It was probably in August 1794 that Taylor petitioned, apparently quite angrily, for higher payment, and from then on Griffiths agreed to pay him three guineas a sheet. 16 Taylor's demanding more money contrasts greatly with his position in July 1793, implying, I would suggest, that, pace Robberds, it was not until 1794 that his circumstances allowed Taylor to "devote himself . . . exclusively to literature." This is supported by the fact that the Norwich papers for 18 July 1795 carried a " NOTICE to the DEBTORS and CREDITORS Of WILLIAM TAYLOR, of the city of Norwich, Shawl-Manufacturer", a notice that clearly represents a final stage in the Taylors' withdrawal from trade, thus suggesting that their regular income from their business would have ceased several months earlier. When he stopped writing for the MR in 1799 Taylor recorded that he had made upwards of £50 a year from Griffiths (Robberds, I, 306). From early 1796 he was a regular contributor to the Monthly Magazine as well, thus considerably augmenting his literary earnings. Given that he continued to live with his parents, never married, and travelled infrequently, this income probably went a long way. The average Norwich weaver earned around £15 a year at this period. 17</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is unfortunate that no more letters between Griffiths and Taylor have been preserved from 1793 after the initial exchange. But when Enfield returned to Norwich sometime in August he must have been delighted to discover that his efforts over the previous eighteen months had not been in vain, and that Griffiths and Taylor had now formed a regular connection. Writing to Griffiths on 3 September, he stated: I am glad to find that M r . T consents to become a regular correspondent: you will find in him a rich vein of genius and philosophy; he will give a new and bold turn to our speculations. (f.77) Enfield's prediction was admirably borne out over the following six years, as Taylor gave expression for the first time to that new "style of philosophical criticism" that Hazlitt would later praise as "characteristic of the Spirit of the Age".</field>

      <field name="fulltext">7 These letters have not previously been attributed to Taylor. I do so for the following reasons: Taylor returned from France sometime in June 1790, and Robberds records "About this time . . . he published, under different signatures, in friendly newspapers, more particularly in the Cambridge Intelligencer, letters on the political questions by which the public mind was then agitated" (I, 67). The Cambridge Intelligencer was not founded until 1793, however, and the only Cambridge paper in 1790 was the Cambridge Chronicle . The "Friend to Liberty" articles appeared between 31 July and 18 September, which makes a suggestive chronology; they contain the style and sentiments we would expect from Taylor, and it seems likely that Robberds made a simple mistake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 Taylor's translations of three of Wieland's Göttergespräche were published as Dialogues of the Gods in 1795, quite possibly because of the appearance of a rival translation of one of the Göttergespräche in William Tooke's Varieties of Literature of the same year. But the Göttergespräche Taylor translated had originally appeared in Der Neue Teutsche Merkur for September, November and December 1790, and were based on the French Revolution as it had then developed. By 1795 many of the sentiments had been rendered absurd by the progress of events; Taylor clearly translated them for their political content and it is therefore likely that he had done so much earlier, perhaps (most plausibly) in 1791. Support for this date is supplied by an anonymous poem entitled "Jupiter's Opinion of Revolutionaries" published in the Norwich Mercury on 8 October 1791; this appears to be an "anti-Jacobin" parody of the Göttergespräch that Taylor translated as "The Federation", suggesting manuscript circulation of the latter. Taylor published five extracts from "Hudibras Modernised" in the Iris ( a Norwich weekly newspaper) in 1803 (19 November-24 December), but a short preface noted that the poem had "been written soon after the Birmingham riots in 1791".</field>

As Griffiths speaks of Taylor having "gone through" his "probation" (131), 1794 seems by far the most likely year.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Holy Pirates: Legal Enforcement in England of the Patent in the Authorized Version of the Bible ca. 1800 by G.E. BENTLEY, JR. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction The copyright in the King James translation or Authorised Version of the Bible of 1611 is vested in England in perpetuity in the Crown and delegated thence to the King's Printer (who may change from time to time), and by him it is shared with the learned presses of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. In practice this has meant that only these presses have been entitled to print and sell the King James translation in England. The privilege has proven a valuable one, but it has been used in different ways by the different presses. For many years, Cambridge printed no Bible at all; at one time Oxford farmed its privilege to London printers; and, at least in 1680, the King's Printer claimed that the learned presses were authorized to print only learned Bibles, i.e., Bibles in folio and quarto sizes. The situation was complicated by uncertainty as to what constitutes a "Bible"--does the copyright cover separate publications of, say, the New Testament or the Apocrypha or the Pentateuch or digests of the Bible? What is the copyright in Bibles accompanied by learned dissertations or with erudite footnotes or with illustrations? Of course, the English patent of 1611 did not extend to Holland or Scotland or Ireland. Printers in Scotland before the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707 and in Ireland before the Act of Union with Ireland in 1800 were perfectly entitled to print the Authorized Version without reference to the Crown copyright--but, since the conventions largely concerned printing, there was some uncertainty as to whether they could sell them in the vastly more lucrative market in England. The Bible was, of course, an extremely valuable commodity to printers and booksellers, since every Protestant church and family needed to have its own copy. Speculators were sorely tempted to share in these profits, and some wonderfully ingenious methods were devised for doing so. A commentary on the Bible or a suite of engraved illustrations for the Bible would profit from the popularity of the Bible--and it might sell even better if it were actually attached to a Bible. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, printers and publishers developed two chief methods to share in the highly profitable monopoly on Bible production in England: (1) Add material that would make the work something beyond a simple Bible, and (2) Print the Authorized Version outside England, in Holland or Dublin or Edinburgh, and sell copies in England. The illustration of Bibles is particularly interesting in this respect. 1 In general, the King's Printer and the Learned Presses did not print illustrated Bibles, though John Field at Cambridge printed a splendid one in 1659-60, and John Baskett created another at Oxford in 1716-17. 2 From 1659, beginning in Amsterdam and spreading to London and thence to the provinces, suites of Bible illustrations without type-set text were published by speculators for English readers. These were designed to be combined with Bibles printed by the patent-holders-- Boydell's Illustrations of Holy Writ (1813) claimed on the titlepage that it was "Calculated to Ornament All Quarto and Octavo Editions of the Bible, and Sold in Parts without The Text". When no legal impediment was raised to this practise, speculators began in 1688 to issue illustrated works called The History of the Old and New Testament which summarized or even incorporated those parts of the Bible represented in the designs. Eventually, they found that they could publish with impunity annotated and illustrated editions of the Bible, so long as the titles were something other than "The Holy Bible", such as The Family Companion or Annotations upon the Holy Bible (1739) and The Christian's New, Complete, and Universal Family Bible (1794). As "John Reeves, Esq. One of the Patentees of the Office of King's Printer" explained in 1802: "all our authorized Bibles, published by the King's printer, and the Universities, are wholly without explanatory notes. These privileged persons have confined themselves to reprinting the bare text, in which they have an exclusive right; forbearing to publish it with notes, which, it is deemed, may be done by any of the King's subjects as well as themselves." 3 When Thomas Macklin proposed in 1790 to publish an enormously ambitious illustrated Bible, he cautiously requested from Oxford "the use of their privilege", implying that it would be worth to him "a large Consideration . . . But the Delegates, not thinking themselves warranted to grant the Privilege whether with, or without compensation, . . . Macklin had recourse (for Security) to the printing . . . Notes . . . at the Foot of the page." 4 However, even the practise of permitting anyone to print the King James translation of the Bible with notes was subject to devious abuse. In 1776 J.W. Pasham printed a curiously-tall duodecimo edition of The Holy Bible with five lines or 3/8 of "NOTES" at the foot of each leaf, thus conforming to the convention of printing with notes. However, as John Reeves complained, "the notes are placed purposely so as to be cut off by the binder". 5 Such deviousness was not confined to the lesser breeds without the patent. A century earlier the London patent holders had complained that the printers "at Oxford . . . print a Bible in Quarto; and so order it that the Marginal Notes in some of the Copies being left out, if in those the Margin be cut close away, they will not be much larger than a large octavo (and these be those which the London printers complain of as being pretended to be Quartos but being really octavos)[.]" 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bible Publishers in Britain 1790-1820 Who were the players in the big leagues of Bible publishing 1790-1820? From the record of published Bibles in Darlow &amp; Moule, 7 it is plain that the most prolific player was the Clarendon Press in Oxford, with 54 Bibles published 1790-1820, in duodecimo (14), octavo (23), quarto (12), and folio (5). 8 Note that it was chiefly the patent-holders who published Bibles in formats of octavo and smaller and that in Oxford only one Bible published during this period was produced for a publisher other than the Clarendon Press. From 1808, at least 12 of the Clarendon Press Bibles are in stereotype, which means that only the titlepages were reset for "editions" with a new date. Note also that some of these Oxford Bibles were printed by Bensley and others in London and that some were printed for Dawson and for the Bible Societies in London. The "Oxford" connexion of some of these Bibles is pretty tenuous. All the Oxford editions of the scriptures are called The Holy Bible , and indeed this title is uniformly used by the Bible patent-holders. It is a kind of claim to authenticity, particularly with the sub-titles "The Old and New Testament" in Oxford Bibles and "The Old Testament and the New" in London and Cambridge ones. Even when Bibles not published by the patent-holders are called The Holy Bible , they often have sub-titles indicating their irregular status, such as "or Divinity Treasury" (1804).

The Bibles produced by at least thirty publishers 12 who did not hold the Bible patent were heavily concentrated upon the larger formats, often illustrated, probably often published by subscription. There were comparatively few in the smaller formats, in sextodecimo (1), duodecimo (7), and octavo (4); most were in quarto (19) and folio (8), and the folios and quartos alone outnumbered all the Bibles published in London by the patent holders. Apparently the speculative Bible-publishers believed that profits were to be found most reliably in the larger formats.

H. Blair &amp; J. Bruce in 1799 (1), and Sir D. Hunter Blair &amp; J. Bruce in 1802-17 (18), in all the formats: 32° (3), 24° (1), sextodecimo (2), duodecimo (14), octavo (5), quarto (8), and folio (1). Notice that in just one year, 1793, J. &amp; C. Kerr produced Bibles in folio, quarto, duodecimo, and 24°, and printed new editions in duodecimo in 1795, 1796 (2), and 1797. Plainly they were preparing to keep a stock of all sizes of Bibles in print. And as the Oxford Bible Minutes reveal, they were equally clearly selling in England these Bibles printed with the King's privilege in Scotland. There is very little information about the size of the editions of the Bibles recorded by Darlow &amp; Moule, but they do note that the Douay Bibles printed by John Moir in Edinburgh for sale "chiefly in England and Ireland" in 1796 in duodecimo and in 1805 in quarto consisted of three thousand copies and two thousand copies respectively, and these may have been something like the norms at least for Bibles in similar formats.

Considering Dublin's notoriety as a centre for printing English works beyond the reach of English copyright law, it is as surprising that only nine Bibles were printed in Dublin as that one was printed in Helston (Cornwall) and four in Bungay. Only a few of the Dublin Bibles were the Catholic Douay version (1791, 1794, 1811, 1814), all called The Holy Bible . Almost half the King James versions were called The Family Bible (1793, 1803, 1804, 1805, 1807, 1812, 1813, 1814, 1815, 1816), usually with additional adjectives such as The Royal Standard Devotional Family Bible . But the most striking feature of these provincial interlopers is their format: 88% are in folio (14) and quarto (16). Many, probably most, of these massive works were issued by subscription, and most were illustrated and heavily annotated. Clearly it was felt that the large format Bibles were the ones most likely to prove profitable.

Twelve of them have titles other than simply The Holy Bible , half of these are a version of The Family Bible , and 69% are in quarto (18) or folio (9). For all the complete Bibles published in Britain in 1790-1820, according to Darlow &amp; Moule, 136 were produced by the patent-holders (53 in Oxford, 32 in Edinburgh, 27 in Cambridge, and 24 in London), while 78 were published by others, almost all of them in London (40) or in provincial cities other than Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh (35). In terms of the Bible sales of the English patent-holders, the greatest threat to the luxury trade in expensive quartos and folios came from a large number (56) of mostly small-scale publishers scattered from London to Helston and Halifax. However, the threat to their bread-and-butter trade in the smaller formats, in octavos and duodecimos, came from just one source: The King's Printers in Edinburgh, who produced 32 Bibles during this period, the vast majority of them (72%) in these smaller formats. From the point of view of the English patent-holders, and particularly of Oxford, the most vigorous of the English patent-holders, the greatest threat to the monopoly they claimed on publication of the King James translation, or rather on its sale in England, came from the King's Printers in Edinburgh. In the latter part of the eighteenth century the Edinburgh printers were becoming more and more aggressive. When what the London printers had understood to be perpetual copyright in all literary works was limited by the judgement in the case of Donaldson vs Beckett in 1774 to fourteen years (renewable for another fourteen years in most circumstances and extended in later copyright acts), the Scottish printers gleefully began printing all manner of English books and selling them in England. And not only did they use English booksellers as their agents, but they printed the Authorized Version of the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, and other works in perpetual Crown copyright in England--and sold them too in England. Their right to print such works was clear, since an English copyright of 1611 did not extend to Scotland, but their right to sell such works in England was not so clear--or at least it was not so clear to the English patent-holders. Though the patent for the Authorized Version belonged to the Crown and was delegated primarily to the King's Printer, Oxford University Press was apparently most active in defending the privilege against English pirates and Scots cruising under alleged letters of marque. The Clarendon Press, after all, printed more editions of the Bible than the Cambridge University Press and the King's Printers in London combined. The infringements against which Oxford campaigned to defend the Bible patent most vigorously were Bibles published with additions, so that they did not count simply as Bibles, and Bibles printed (legally) outside England but imported into England for sale and therefore overlapping with the royal privilege for England. The two campaigns were carried on simultaneously, against both domestic enemies printing padded Bibles and foreign enemies printing mere Bibles. (Notice that no padded edition of the Authorized Version was printed in Scotland during these years.) The first campaign was against domestic enemies. According to the "Minutes of the Committee appointed by the Delegates of the Press for conferring with the Partners in the Bible trade" 16 for 26 October 1796, the London partners (i.e., Thomas Bensley 17 and James Cooke) "represent that several Pirated Editions [of the Bible] have been printed of late &amp; that the number of them is increasing, two of which were this day exhibited." Perhaps the Bibles exhibited were those of 1796 printed for R. Bowyer (duodecimo and quarto), R. Bowyer &amp; J. Fittler (duodecimo), or J. Wright (quarto). A manuscript summary headed "Case of the University of Oxford upon their Right of printing Bibles and common prayer &amp; c " (1797) asserts: The Editors of the Bible and common prayer, in London, and elsewhere, seem to know that the privilege is exclusively vested in the University [i.e., the two universities], and the King's printer, by printing always some Notes with their Editions, such in most cases as are thrown to the very bottom of the page, to be cut off when the Book is bound; by this Evasion--holding that they publish [i.e., print] the Scriptures or common prayer with Annotations and so avoid infringing upon that which is protected by privilege; the University not contending for the sole Right of printing Bibles &amp; c with commentaries &amp; Expositions where such additional materials are bonâ fide a substantive work, and w[h]ere the text of the Bible &amp; c is merely a necessary adjunct to render the principal Exposition more intelligible[.] The University asked its solicitors Whether such a[n exclusive] privilege [of printing Bibles and common prayers] (if existing [)] is a Bar to others printing Bibles and common prayers, with plates or annotations ; and if not, whether such Notes or Plates as are added with intent to be afterwards cut off or separated from the page or are capable of being cut off or separated without Injury to the Book or such even as are inserted in the Back of the Work for the manifest purpose of giving it the Name of a different thing from the Bible or common prayer Book being only apparently or superficially but not substantially different , would be sufficient to protect other Editors against the University Privilege, or would be deemed in a Court of Justice to be mere Evasions. To these questions, William Scott, John Scott, and John Mitford, of Lincoln's Inn, responded on 13 April 1797 that the University of Oxford has merely a right to print bibles &amp; common prayers . . . and has . . . no right to restrain others from printing the same books. The university of Cambridge seems to be in the same position .... We apprehend the King's printers have a grant containing a clause excluding others from printing those books, except the Universities or persons claiming a right to print under prior grants of the Crown; &amp; under the terms of their exclusive privilege, may apply to a court of equity to restrain persons, who claim under a prior grant of the Crown, from printing the books to which their exclusive privilege extends . . . . it seems to us that plates &amp; annotations, printed with the view suggested, &amp; not forming of themselves the work printed, to which the translation of the bible or the forms of common prayer shall be merely accessaries, will not protect the printer from the consequences of infringing the exclusive rights of the Crown, &amp; the kings' printers as patentees of the Crown .... Oxford and Cambridge therefore joined with the King's Printers to issue warnings to those encroaching upon their privileges, but with less than the desired effect. According to the Oxford Bible Press Committee minutes for 21 October 1800, M r Bensley &amp; M r Cooke reported by advice of M r Dawson that notwithstanding the late advertisement in the name of the Kings Printer &amp; the two universities it would be expedient to proceed farther &amp; file an injunction against each of the principal vendors of the pirated Editions, a list of whom was brought prepared by M r Dawson-- 18 The Kings Printer in the conference they had with him seemed to be of the same opinion-- The King's Printers may have agreed with Oxford and Cambridge, but they apparently left the learned presses to undertake the trouble and expense of such a defence of their common interests. Just a year later, on 21 October 1801, Mess rs Bensley &amp; Cooke report that the [Oxford Bible] trade is at present considerably on the decline, 19 principally on account of the great influx of Scotch books, &amp; the pains taken to disperse them throughout the country, &amp; that it is likely to be entirely ruined except measures are speedily taken to put an end to this encroachment--Three presses are already stopp'd, &amp; a considerable debt has been incurred--The Scotch Printers are said to have 20 presses to work-- Ordered by the delegates that a bill in Chancery be filed against the Vendor of the Scotch Bible in London [.] And three months later, on 26 January 1802, An injunction having been obtained against Richardson, Vendor of the Scotch Books in London, Mess rs Dawson, Bensley &amp; Cooke advise that proceedings be also instituted against some of the Vendors of Books printed without Authority in England, &amp; they fix upon Corrall 20 . . . &amp; his agent Hurst, Paternoster Row .... They recommend also that Letters be then sent to all other dealers in Town &amp; Country, &amp; that they be also prosecuted unless they entirely give up the sale of such books [An insertion notes that it was so Order'd Jan. 29] . . . On 29 January 1802 the Court of Chancery issued an injunction against Messrs Richardson 21 "for selling or exposing to sale, any copies or impressions of the Bible, Testament, Book of Common Prayer, &amp;c. printed by his Majesty's Printer in Scotland", 22 but the same day "Mess rs Bensley &amp; Cooke reported, that the trade still suffers from the encroachments of others against whom Injunctions have not been granted, who continue to vend Scotch books". 23 However, on 11 May 1802, "Mess rs Bensley &amp; Cooke reported . . . that the general State of the Trade appears to have been improving, since the injunctions have been granted by the Court of Chancery against Richardson &amp; Corral". The case of the universities was promptly sustained by the Lord High Chancellor, and on 1 March 1802 William Richardson, John Richardson, and James Richardson appealed to the House of Lords against the order preventing them from selling, or exposing to sale, certain books therein mentioned, which they had been in the practice of selling for above forty years, prior to the instituting that suit, without any disturbance or interruption. . . . for several years last past, his Majesty's Printer had not found it necessary to put forth any new edition or copies of the said books [the Holy Bible, the New Testament, the Book of Common Prayer, Administration of the Sacrament, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England], but had left the due supply thereof, wholly to the respondents, who had, respectively, employed a very large capital in such printing and publishing .... 24 The House of Lords confirmed the Lord High Chancellor's decision on 4 May 1804, and Oxford, Cambridge, and the King's Printer gave notice on 23 July 1805 "that legal means will be taken" against those who sell such works without privilege. 25 However, the universities could not be confident that the King's Printers were their allies. On 23 January 1804, "Mess rs Dawson, Bensley &amp; Cooke report that the trend[?] of the encroachment in the [Bible] Privilege encreases, &amp; has even taken a new shape--That not only M r Reeves but Mr Strachan [i.e., Andrew Strahan] also have taken the measure of communicating their privilege to others"--that is, they have sold to others the right to print the Bible. The problem of Bible pirates and of what constitutes a Bible pirate persisted. For instance, could a Bible patent-holder be at the same time a Bible pirate? Was it legal for a Bible patent-holder to license others to print Bibles? A clipping from an unidentified periodical in the Oxford University Press archives dated "1818" in MS summarizes a LAW REPORT. VICE-CHANCELLOR'S COURT, Dec. 14. THE UNIVERSITIES OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE v BLAKE 26 AND OTHERS. The Solicitor General moved, on the part of the Chancellor, Masters, and Fellows of the two Universities, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing the sale of certain works, the exclusive copyright of which is vested in those public bodies by letters-patent. The Books in question were the Holy Scriptures, and the Book of Common Prayer. An edition of the former had recently been published under the title of Gurney's Bible, with a Commentary and Annotations. These were, however, nothing more than a pretext, and were used only to colour an invasion of literary property. A separate edition, of quarto size, 27 accompanied by reflexions, had also been offered to the world by the same booksellers, together with two copies [i.e., editions] of the Prayer Book. One of these professed to be an abridgement, but in point of fact contained the whole of that portion of the service which is usually read. The other, gave the whole text, subjoining a variety of annotations. As the originals could not legally be published, without a license from one of the Universities, he apprehended that the addition of notes, or omission of particular parts, must be considered as a mere attempt at disguise, and would not be allowed by a court of equity to defeat a valuable privilege. The Vice-Chancellor granted the injunction .... Notice that the injunction appears to be concerned only with Bibles and Prayer Books which have appended "Commentary and Annotations . . . only to colour an invasion of literary property" or which "professed to be an abridgement". Since annotated and abridged Bibles and Prayer Books had for almost a century been published with impunity by booksellers who had no share in the patent, this implies a radical reinterpretation of the implications of the patent. Of course, this injunction spread alarm, "terror and dismay" among the booksellers who had for years been selling annotated and illustrated Bibles printed without license from the patent-holders, and another clipping in the Oxford University Press archives from an unidentified periodical dated in MS Saturday "Jany 23 1819" reports a MEETING OF BOOKSELLERS . A numerous Meeting of the Publishers, Booksellers, Stationers, and all others interested in the sale of the Holy Scriptures, was held yesterday evening at the Globe Tavern, Fleet-street, to take into consideration the recent attack made on the trade, as relates to the sale of Bibles and Prayer-books. As the nature of this attack may not be known to the generality of our readers, we shall endeavour to explain it by giving, in a few words, a short abstract of a Report made by a Committee, appointed on Thursday evening to investigate into its extent. It appeared from that report, that for two or three years past bills in Chauncery have been filed, and silently operating under the instruction of a patentee, against persons selling Edinburgh Bibles or Common Prayers. During the last term a hundred injunctions were obtained against different booksellers in London and the suburbs, and 90 are entered for the present term. At first the injunctions were only levelled against Bibles printed at Edinburgh, but lately they have been extended against Bibles, Testaments and Common Prayers, printed in England, with commentaries and notes. This proceeding has spread terror and dismay through the various booksellers both in town and country: especially as they have been likewise informed, that they cannot , under the existing law, sell any Bible in the English tongue, or in any other tongue whatsoever, of any translation, with note or without note , which is not printed at the press of the King's printer, or at the press[es] of the two Universities. As this system was rapidly spreading in every direction, the trade took it up, and assembled yesterday evening to discuss the propriety of resisting with all the energy which such an invasion of what they deemed their long established rights demanded. After some discussion, they entered into a resolution of appointing a Committee of 12 London booksellers, with full powers to adapt all such measures as should be requisite to terminate the depending prosecutions, and to prevent any future occurrence. This was followed by another resolution, empowering them to receive subscriptions to enable them to proceed in the cause. We understand that large sums were immediately deposited in the hands of the Commiittee, several persons advancing from twenty to thirty pounds each, and one gentleman in particular the large sum of 150 guineas. From hints that were dropped in the course of the discussion, we are led to conjecture, that the great body of booksellers will immediately combine, and present a petition to the two Houses of Parliament, to obtain some modification of the present patent. There can scarcely have been any ground for claiming that the King's printer and the two university presses had exclusive rights under "the present patent" to print the Bible in any language " with note or without note" . The allegation must have been made ad terrorem either by the patent-holders as an expendable bargaining position or, far more probably, by the booksellers in order to persuade the dismayed and terrified booksellers to contribute generously to the cause. Certainly nothing in the 1818 Law Report makes such sweeping claims. But whatever the implausibility of the allegation, it was sufficiently convincing to persuade the booksellers to contribute "large sums" to the defence fund. To the booksellers it must have seemed that all the struggles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to secure access to the Authorized Version of the Bible must be repeated--with the additional threat that they might not be allowed to print even other versions of the Bible. To the patent-holders, it must have seemed that as long as they were resisting the invasions of the Scottish buccanneers, they might as well at the same time attempt to recover the exclusive right to print annotated and illustrated Bibles which they (or at least the King's Printer) had tamely conceded to the booksellers at large at the end of the eighteenth century. Plainly both sides were marshalling their troops along the legal border, enriching their war-chests, spreading propaganda, and preparing for the onset of hostilities for a war that threatened to spread commercial carnage on an international scale. Alas! the documents I have seen do not enable me to present further battle-bulletins. Injunctions don't get recorded very extensively, even a barrage of them like this. And even if one could get evidence as to whom the injunctions were directed against, one still couldn't draw very useful conclusions unless one could ascertain that the injunctions were breached or that they changed the actions of the injunctee. The documents have, however, made plain some of the principles of literary property at issue in the war, and they have identified the combatants on the two sides fairly plainly. Whatever they said, both sides were fighting under the banner of Mammon, though the patent-holders doubtless preferred to be known as the party of Church and King. The cause of Church and King was vigourously led by Oxford University Press, seconded, at least financially, by Cambridge University Press. The King's Printer in London seems to have permitted the campaign rather than fostered it, and indeed at least in Oxford there seems to have been some suspicion that he had a foot in the enemy camp. Opposed to the Church and King party were most conspicuously the King's Printers in Scotland (Sir D. Hunter Blair &amp; J. Bruce in Edinburgh), but Oxford had initiated hostilities in such a way that most of the substantial book-sellers in Britain were probably ranged against them. Further, if report of the 1819 Meeting of Booksellers is to be believed, the Church and King party led by Oxford and Cambridge University Presses was not merely defending their ancient privileges of printing and selling unillustrated and unannotated editions of the Authorized Version of the Bible; it was attempting to extend these privileges very substantially, so as to prevent the sale of " any Bible in the English tongue , or in any other tongue whatsoever , of any translation , with note or without note , which is not printed at the press of the King's printer, or at the press[es] of the two Universities". The legal conquest of such a terrain would, of course, have been immensely valuable. And while it is clear that the Church and King party did not conquer this new terrain, it is equally clear that they did maintain their privilege of printing and selling the Authorized Version of the Bible in England. In some ways, access to the word of God was as hotly contested by booksellers at the beginning of the nineteenth century as it had been among logocentric Protestants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Should the King's Printers and the university presses have an exclusive right to God's Word as priests had had in former ages? There was money in God's Word, and in the nineteenth century the debate swirled about the issue not of who should read God's Word but of who should make a profit from it. The fortunes of the war are fascinating, but in religious terms there may be some doubt as to whether they are edifying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* I am grateful for assistance particularly to Mr Peter Foden, Archivist of Oxford University Press, for guidance in finding and interpreting these Bible patent papers, and to Professor David Vander Meulen for advice about organizing the essay. 1 See "Images of the Word: Separately Published English Bible Illustrations 1539-1830", Studies in Bibliography , 47 (1994), 103-128. 2 On 24 Jan 1797, the Clarendon Bible Press Committee Minute Book (in the Oxford University Press archives) records discussion of "the best means of giving some embellishment to Editions of the Bible and Common Prayer by the addition of Plates, vignettes &amp;c.", and six years later, on 25 Jan 1803, it records that "The Delegates are inclin[e]d to accede" to the "proposal . . . to publish a splendid Bible, imperial 4°, with plates . . . the proprietors of the plates . . . being allow[e]d a share of the Edition to be settled afterwards . . . provided the Artists are content to engrave either from old prints or from accurate pictures of establish[e]d credit including such as may be found in Oxford fit for the purpose, the choice to be approv'd by the Delegates ...." This sounds like a speculation the costs of which were to be shared by the Press and the engravers, but the engravers changed their minds, perhaps because of the artistic control demanded by the Delegates. The Committee minutes for 13 June 1803 record: "Mess rs Thomson &amp; Slann[?], the Artists who proposed to engrave Plates for a splendid Edition of the Bible, having now other Engagements incompatible with this Employment, find it necessary to decline all further proceedings in the Business--" 3 The Holy Bible (London: John Reeves, George &amp; William Nichol, 1802), Vol. I, pp. ix-x. There are a few notes in this edition, both at the feet of the pages and at the back, and other editions printed by the patentees are similar. 4 MS "Case of the University of Oxford upon their Right of printing Bibles and common prayer &amp;c" (with a legal opinion dated 13 April 1797) in the archive of Oxford University Press.

The practice, apparently not denied by Oxford, implies Oxford's recognition at the time that their copyright was only for large-format (i.e., learned) Bibles. However, in later years Oxford printed small-format Bibles without challenge. The King's printer, at least in the view of Oxford, sold Bibles in 1680 below cost in order to drive Oxford (and Cambridge) out of the Bible business. 7 The following tables derive from T. H.

Note that I report only works consisting of at least the Old and New Testaments and that Darlow &amp; Moule record copies with titlepages of different dates only under the later date. D&amp;M seem to make little distinction between re-printing, re-publishing, and re-issuing, between new issues and new editions with newly-set type. For instance, they note that the text of the edition published in 1798 in Cambridge by J. Archdeacon &amp; J. Burges (Printers to the University) (D&amp;M # 1424) is identical with the edition printed by the University Press (D&amp;M #1428). The problem is further complicated by stereotype editions which have identical texts (in the same format by the same publisher), though the titlepages may differ. Even for the works listed here, therefore, some entries represent a new issue of old sheets and some probably represent sheets for more than one edition. Note that D&amp;M record both size (in mm.) and format (e.g., 8°) for works printed before 1800 but that they give only size (in cm) thereafter; I have converted all post-1800 sizes to format. Further, they identify "the printer (or publisher )", but it is not always clear which is which. 8 According to Simon Eliot, Some Patterns and Trends in British Publishing 1800-1919 (London: The Bibliographical Society, 1994) [Bibliographical Society Occasional Papers Number 8], p. 131, Parliamentary Papers , XVIII (1831-32), 337, 342, 343 record for the decade 1821-1830: Press Bibles New Testaments Prayer Books Psalms King's 565,500 25.7% 591,000 26 % 178,500 6% 167,000 60/0 Oxford 1,253,000 57% 1,221,500 53% 2,269,000 77.5% 2039,750 8076 Cambridge 380,500 17.3% 483,7 50 21% 481,000 16.5% 358,500 1 4% 2,199,000 100% 2,296,250 100% 2,928,500 100% 2,565,250 100% Note that Oxford published more than half the authorized versions in each category (over 75% of the Prayer Books and Psalms), that all three presses published more copies of the separate New Testament than of the whole Bible, and that Oxford published on average some 125,000 copies of the Bible per year in 1821-30. Bibles were clearly very big business. In successive years Oxford increased the number of Bibles it printed annually (136,000 in 1831-36, 237,000 in 1837-47, 292,000 in 1848-50), but its share of the market for Authorized Bibles diminished when the figures of the Queen's Printer in Scotland are included for 1837-50: 1837-47 1848-50 1837-50 Queen's (England) 2,284,540 32% 115,750 8% 2,400,390 28% Oxford 2,612,750 37% 875,750 61% 3488,500 42% Cambridge 895,500 13% 138,500 10% 1,034,000 12% Queen's (Scotland) 1,218,371 18% 299,305 21% 1,517,676 18% Total 6,813,161 100% 1,429,305 100% 8,440,466 l00% 9 Except for the Bible published in 1817 by Bartlett &amp; Co.

      <field name="heading_text">Drawings and Withdrawings: The Vicissitudes of Thomas Hardy's Wessex Poems by PAMELA DALZIEL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wessex Poems and Other Verses , first published in London by Harper and Brothers in mid-December 1898, was and remained unique among Thomas Hardy's works in being extensively illustrated by its author. 1 Hardy's references to Wessex Poems throughout his career consistently contain a detectable tension between, on the one hand, a strong personal and creative commitment to the drawings and, on the other, an uncertainty as to their value either in themselves or as illustrative reinforcements or enhancements of the poems. It was an opposition or ambiguity that Hardy seems never to have resolved and that was clearly related to and sometimes responsible for several curious aspects of the work's publication history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Hardy had been gathering the poems for the volume over a number of years 2 --several of them, indeed, having been at least drafted in the 1860s--the illustrations appear to have been late additions. The title, 'Wessex Poems: With Sketches of their Scenes by the Author', appears in the autobiographical Life and Work of Thomas Hardy against the date 4 February 1897 (p. 302), but much of the work on those sketches seems to have been done during the summer and early autumn of the following year. Hardy noted in the Preface to Wessex Poems , dated September 1898, that the drawings had been 'recently made' (p. viii), and on the 22nd of that month he wrote to his friend Florence Henniker: 'The "mysterious occupation" (which I have now finished) is one you will not have guessed I think. It has been the making of some sketches in possible illustration of some verses of mine which I think now of publishing. I told nobody I was doing the sketches, as I was by no means sure that the attempt wd come to anything' ( Collected Letters , ii. 201-202). Writing to the same correspondent on 17 October Hardy downplayed the importance of the sketches ('small pen-&amp; ink [ sic ] drawings--much the worse from my years of unpractice') even while speaking appreciatively of the interest she had shown in them: 'You please me by your caring about them' ( Collected Letters , ii. 203). On 13 November 1898 he again insisted to Henniker: 'The sketches are quite unimportant--as, indeed, are the poems', and while the comment seems on the face of it comprehensively deprecating, the emphasis is clearly, and defensively, on the illustrations, described in the Preface as 'rough sketches' which, 'as may be surmised, are inserted for personal and local reasons rather than for their intrinsic qualities' ( Collected Letters , ii. 205; Preface, p. viii).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardy evidently took pleasure in reverting to the skills he had developed as an architect 3 and continued to exercise (despite his insistence on 'years of unpractice') in the pages of his pocket-sized diary-notebooks. Three months after publication, when he had had more time to develop a rationale for the inclusion of the illustrations, Hardy told his friend Edward Clodd that he had found in their preparation 'a sort of illegitimate interest--that which arose from their being a novel amusement, &amp; a wholly gratuitous performance which could not profit me anything, &amp; probably would do me harm' ( Collected Letters , ii. 217). That there was for Hardy an element of self-indulgence in making the drawings seems clear enough. It is, however, striking that even in writing to Clodd, probably his closest male confidant at this period, he remained unwilling or unable to articulate what he perceived as the function of the drawings as integral elements of Wessex Poems --whether, for example, he saw them as providing needed support to a risky first venture into the publication of verse or as simply constituting a supplementary gesture of expressive independence that would the more clearly mark his abandonment of prose fiction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little is known of the composition of Wessex Poems , Hardy having destroyed virtually all textual evidence pre-dating the surviving manuscript he later presented to the Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery. In a letter to Edmund Gosse of 14 February 1899 he cited his absorption in 'the novel occupation of making the drawings' as an excuse for having revised the poems 'so perfunctorily' ( Collected Letters , ii. 214), but the manuscript, even though fair copy, still shows a considerable degree of authorial textual revision and indecision. 4 The titles of several poems are altered and numerous corrections are made to individual words and lines: the text of 'The Impercipient', for example, is affected in both respects. 5 Similar last-minute decisions seem to have been made with respect to the illustrations. There are thirty-two drawings in the manuscript--all of them almost certainly fair copies (perhaps tracings) of earlier drafts--and the first pre-publication advertisements of the volume announced that it would contain that number of illustrations. 6 The title-page of Wessex Poems as published refers to the presence of thirty illustrations, but the volume in fact contains thirty-one, the frontispiece having perhaps been left out of account. The missing illustration--a tailpiece to 'The Casterbridge Captains'--was not included in any edition published during Hardy's lifetime and in fact appeared for the first time 'in its proper place' in 1982, in the first volume of Samuel Hynes's edition of The Complete Poetical Works (i. 64, 388).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardy was doubtful of the success of his new venture--to the point, according to the Life , of offering to indemnify Harper and Brothers against any losses they might incur through publishing the volume (p. 325). He was, however, no stranger to the use of illustrations in association with written text, having long been accustomed as a novelist to the conventions and assumed advantages of serial illustration. He had also been engaged in selecting the subjects of the frontispieces Henry Macbeth- Raeburn had been commissioned to provide for the Osgood, McIlvaine 'Wessex Novels' collected edition of 1895-96--to which Wessex Poems was, in effect, being added as a supplementary (though unnumbered) volume. 7 Harper and Brothers, who had recently absorbed Osgood, McIlvaine and were therefore now acting as Hardy's publishers on both sides of the Atlantic, were not in fact hesitant about taking Wessex Poems . They allowed Hardy generous terms 8 and issued the volume in a variety of formats--in London in both the dark green 'Wessex Novels' binding at six shillings and a white buckram binding at seven-and-sixpence, and in New York in a light green binding stamped on the front cover with a six-colour 'Wessex' scene derived from one of Hardy's illustrations. 9 Hardy wrote in a 13 November 1898 letter to Henniker of 'waiting for the American issue' ( Collected Letters , ii. 205), and in fact it was being reset page for printed page from the London edition, though incorporating American spelling and economizing in length by not necessarily beginning a new poem on a new right-hand page. Because the entire edition was set on high quality art paper, the illustrations were more sharply reproduced than in the British edition. They were slightly redistributed, however, as a consequence of the repagination, and the drawing for 'She, to Him I' became in the process somewhat disturbingly relocated opposite the sestet of 'Revulsion'. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardy, at this major turning point of his career, was deeply anxious as to the reception of Wessex Poems , and when the London edition was published in mid-December 1898--a month ahead of the New York edition--he sent out an unusually large number of presentation copies to friends and fellow authors. 11 Swinburne, one of the recipients, praised poems and illustrations alike, 12 but the volume met with a decidedly mixed reception from the contemporary press, and Hardy had some justification for his complaint--later expressed at length in the pages of the Life --that his reputation as a novelist prevented the poems from receiving a fair hearing: 'There were those prose works standing in a row in front, catching the eye at every attempt to see the poetry, and forming an almost impenetrable screen' (p. 320).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The illustrations, though often ignored by the reviewers, generally fared rather better than the poems themselves. Approval, it is true, was sometimes ambiguously expressed--the Westminster Gazette noting that the effect of the drawings, 'like that of Mr. Hardy's best poems, is curiously in advance of their technical merits'--but the Glasgow Herald , for example, declared that the sketches not only helped to 'give force to the poetry' but were 'themselves poems', while in the Speaker Arthur Quiller-Couch insisted that, for all their stiffness, they possessed an 'intrinsic beauty' and were 'packed with meaning', revealing 'something which the poems they decorate are also trying to reveal'. 13 The Athenæum reviewer, though judging Hardy's success as a poet to be 'of a very narrow range', also saw the drawings as consistent with 'some of the most marked characteristics' of the texts they accompanied: 'Primitive in execution, and frequently inspired by a somewhat grim mortuary imagination, they are still full of poetry, and show a real sense of the decorative values of architectural outline and nocturnal landscape. Even without the verses, they are a new light on Wessex.' 14 The Daily Chronicle reviewer was similarly sympathetic to the drawings, to the point of commenting favourably on a number of specific examples, and even one of the most hostile commentators, in Literature , after pronouncing on the 'unfitness' of verse as a 'medium of expression for Mr. Hardy's genius', sought to drive that judgement somewhat unkindly home by declaring, 'The illustrative sketches which are all of them interesting, and not a few of them singularly powerful little studies of the wide and rolling pastures that he loves, express that genius far more adequately.' 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The passage in the Life (pp. 319-325) dealing with the reviews of Wessex Poems makes no reference to the illustrations, and it would indeed seem that their presence in the volume, if not in itself a strongly positive factor, did not have any significant negative impact on the initial reception of the poems. That Hardy failed to illustrate his next volume of verse, Poems of the Past and the Present ([1901]), is perhaps not surprising in view of the very different character and subject matter of most of the poems included in this collection. As for Time's Laughingstocks , when the time came to prepare the volume for publication in 1909 Hardy had already published the three volumes of The Dynasts as well as the two earlier collections of verse and doubtless thought of himself as solidly established as a poet and of the poems themselves as no longer in need of whatever direct or indirect enhancement illustration might conceivably supply. Individual poems were sometimes illustrated by professional artists on the occasion of their first appearance in periodicals and pamphlets, 16 but--with the special and very limited exception of The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall --Hardy himself never attempted any repetition of the Wessex Poems experiment. 17</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not, however, seek to abandon or repudiate any aspect of the contents or format of Wessex Poems , even though in the period immediately following his decision to change his British publisher from Harper and Brothers to Macmillan and Company in 1902 the novels were naturally enough the main topic of his correspondence with Frederick Macmillan. Writing to Macmillan on 9 July 1902, Hardy noted that his final agreement with Harper had specified that at its termination date, 4 October 1902, the plates of his works were to be available at half cost and any outstanding stock at cost, and it was promptly agreed that Macmillan should approach Harper and Brothers on the matter--also that Hardy should have the opportunity to make a number of corrections to some of the novels before reprinting. 18 From Hardy's letter of 14 July 1902 it appears that their discussion of the 'set' of works to be republished had thus far related only to the novels: would it not be advisable, he now asked, 'to get the plates of the 2 vols. of poems from Harpers', even though their rights to the recently published Poems of the Past and the Present had not yet expired ( Collected Letters , iii. 28). 19 Evidently assuming that Macmillan might need to be persuaded as to the desirability of adding the poems to the series, he went on to observe that 'as people nowadays are bent on getting complete sets of a writer's books they are necessary to enable you to use the word in your list' ( Collected Letters , iii. 29).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Macmillan's negotiations with Harper resulted in an agreement of 7 October 1902 which specified, inter alia, the purchase of a set of plates of Wessex Poems at a cost of thirty pounds and the loan of the moulds of Poems of the Past and the Present ; it also involved the purchase of forty-one copies in the seven-and-sixpenny white buckram binding and fifty-nine copies in the six-shilling dark green bold- ribbed cloth binding. 20 As with the one hundred copies of each of the novels in the six-shilling format which Macmillan purchased at the same time, the idea (as Frederick Macmillan explained to Hardy on 24 September 1902) was to keep the 'edition' available for sale to 'such people as ask for it' 21 --its greater price as compared with the new Macmillan three-and-sixpenny volumes continuing to be justified by its larger paper size, its ribbed cloth binding, and (where the fiction titles were concerned) its inclusion of the Macbeth- Raeburn frontispieces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although cheaper, smaller, and less handsomely produced than its Osgood, McIlvaine/Harper predecessor, the Macmillan Wessex Poems of 1903 received careful attention from both its author and its publisher. The several alterations Hardy made to his text of 1898 are conveniently traceable as the ' WP03 ' level in Hynes's listing of variant readings in The Complete Poetical Works , and while the 'illustrations' for which Hardy expressed concern in his letter to Frederick Macmillan of 11 October 1902 22 were probably Macbeth-Raeburn's 'Wessex Novels' frontispieces rather than his own Wessex Poems drawings, neither he nor Macmillan seems to have suggested that those drawings might now be omitted. Macmillan did obtain from Harper and Brothers the blocks of the Wessex Poems illustrations, but while the illustrations were situated in precisely the locations they had occupied in the original London printing of 1898, there was a general though by no means consistent reversal in the orientation of those whose width exceeded their length and therefore had had to be rotated ninety degrees to use effectively the space of a full page. While in 1898 the illustration to, for instance, 'The Impercipient' (p. [183]) had faced inwards, towards the text of the poem, in 1903 it now faced outwards, away from the text. Visually this might be considered an improvement--the illustration did not have to be looked at from across the distance and disturbance of the text--but it was no less a disruption of that interplay between text and illustration which Hardy had presumably sought to achieve in the volume as a whole. Given that such illustrations face consistently inwards in 1898 and only inconsistently outwards in 1903, it is hard to imagine that the change reflected a deliberate design decision, let alone a decision emanating from Hardy himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another, clearly unintended, discrepancy between the 1898 first edition and its successor resulted from the discovery that the block for the main 'Leipzig' illustration (p. [74]) had somehow been mislaid: 'There seems to be nothing for it', Frederick Macmillan told Hardy on 8 June 1903, 'but to re-engrave the picture and I shall be much obliged if for this purpose you can lend us the original drawing which Messrs. Harper &amp; Brothers think is in your possession.' 23 This was the occasion of the elaborately painstaking letter which Hardy wrote from London to his wife at Max Gate in the hope that she would manage to find the original drawing without his having to leave London in order to search for it in person. 24 It also produced a plainly visible difference between the illustration of 1898 and that of 1903, even though that visibility is primarily the result of the 1903 decision not to trim the bottom of Hardy's drawing (as had been done in 1898). 25 Characteristically, Hardy was at once deliberate and deprecating in requesting return of the 'Leipzig' drawing some six months later: 'I do not value it,' he wrote to Frederick Macmillan, 'but it will be best to keep the whole set together' ( Collected Letters , iii. 100).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was in this form and--for better or worse--with these features that Wessex Poems became permanently fixed as a work combining text and related illustration. Interestingly enough, the 25 March 1903 order as recorded in the relevant Macmillan 'Editions Book' shows that the figure of 1,000 for the first printing was a substitution for the figure of 2,000 originally inscribed. 26 Precisely the same alteration was made to the order, of the same date, for Poems of the Past and the Present , and while both changes could have been the result of simple clerical error it seems more likely that a publishing decision had been made not to assign the poems the same 2,000- volume print runs as had earlier been ordered for the novel and short story titles. However, the inclusion of Wessex Poems as a separate title in Macmillan's three-and-sixpenny so-called Uniform Edition was clearly of importance to Hardy, and this text remained in print, with minor variation in binding, for the rest of his life and beyond. The first printing of 1,000 copies in 1903 was followed by two printings of 500 copies each in 1911 and 1916 and a final printing of 1,000 copies in September 1923. 27</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The integration of text and illustration was kept alive for a considerably wider audience through the medium of the highly popular Macmillan Pocket Edition, in which Wessex Poems first appeared, in a joint volume with Poems of the Past and the Present , in June 1907. An initial printing of 1,000 copies was followed by a second printing of 2,000 copies just over a year later 28 and then by seven more printings between then and 1928, to a final total of 22,000 copies 29 --a respectable tally, even though it comes nowhere near the figures for the novels in the same series, some of them reprinted several times in the 1920s in runs of 5,000 and 10,000 copies. Hardy was at first doubtful about the feasibility of including the Wessex Poems drawings in the Pocket Edition format, only to change his mind after inspecting a copy of Thackeray's Vanity Fair as published in Macmillan's Illustrated Pocket Library. On 27 September 1906 he wrote to Frederick Macmillan: 'I am much obliged for the pretty copy of "Vanity Fair". I had not realized that the thin paper would bear the illustrations so well; &amp; there will therefore be no difficulty with the poems' ( Collected Letters , iii. 228). He then ended the letter with one of those gestures of shy defiance that so often marked his references to the illustrations: 'Some people say, too, that they like the drawings.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In view of Hardy's continuing loyalty to the drawings, it seems curious that they should have been excluded from the relevant volume of the Macmillan Wessex Edition--the edition he liked to think of as embodying his ultimate intentions and for which he undertook what were, in most cases, his most systematic revisions. It has generally been assumed, on the basis of Hardy's letter to Frederick Macmillan of 10 October 1912, that he had no particular interest in the inclusion or exclusion of the illustrations from the volume in which Wessex Poems was again to appear in company with Poems of the Past and the Present and that he was easily deterred by the inconvenience of his having already presented the original drawings to the Birmingham Museum: 'I do not myself care much to have them reproduced in the Wessex Edition; but will subscribers grumble if they are not included? I should like the question of sale to decide the matter: if the enhanced sale would make it worth while, we might ask to borrow them; if not trouble would be saved by leaving them out' ( Collected Letters , iv. 231). That this was in fact another instance of Hardy's long-standing indecision about the illustrations--his hesitation to insist upon their importance in face of the objections of others--is strongly suggested by the survival of previously unrecorded evidence in the Dorset County Museum. 30</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That evidence takes the form of an envelope, originally addressed to Hardy himself and bearing a 13 September 1926 postmark, on which Hardy has written in blue crayon, 'Illustrations to "Wessex Poems" (from proofs)'. The envelope does indeed contain, individually cut or torn out, a not quite complete set (four are missing) of the Wessex Poems illustrations. It is, however, clear--from the rough edges along the gutter sides of several leaves, from the weight and quality of the paper, and from the presence of printed matter on both sides of each leaf--that the illustrations have been removed not from proofs but from a copy of one of the published editions. From the presence of stint marks and inky fingerprints on several leaves and from the fact that the segments of text preserved on the reverse of four of the illustrations carry revisions in Hardy's hand it can further be inferred that the copy in question had passed through the printers' hands as setting copy for a new edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The revisions themselves are not unfamiliar, in that all of them were incorporated in 1912 into the Wessex Edition volume of Wessex Poems (also containing Poems of the Past and the Present ): the most extensive of them involves the replacement of the original opening of the second stanza of 'The Alarm', ''Twas hard to realize on This snug side the mute horizon', by 'It was almost past conceiving Here, where woodbines hung inweaving,'. 31 It is also a straightforward matter to determine (by page size and other such criteria) that the copy on which they are inscribed must have derived from one or other of the printings of the Macmillan Uniform Edition. And since Hardy is known to have used copies of that edition in revising other titles for the Wessex Edition, 32 it seems clear that the Dorset County Museum fragments were detached from the setting copy for the Wessex Edition of Wessex Poems . It seems equally clear--from the ample presence of printing-house marks on the illustration pages and from the simple fact that omission of the illustrations has not been either graphically or verbally signalled--that at the time of his first submitting the corrected copy to Macmillan Hardy's assumption, even his 'intention', was that his drawings would continue to remain in place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The terms of the 10 October 1912 letter--quoted above--in which Hardy failed to insist upon inclusion of the drawings can perhaps be better understood in relation to the 9 October letter from Frederick Macmillan to which he was replying. Observing that the illustrated Wessex Poems was about to share a single volume of the Wessex Edition with the unillustrated Poems of the Past and the Present , Macmillan asked what Hardy would 'like done' about the situation: It would of course be a very simple plan to omit the illustrations, but you may have some wish to retain them. If you have I will ask you to send us the original drawings so that we may re-engrave them all in line. This will be necessary because the half-tone blocks which are in the original book will not print on the hand-made paper. Of course there is something to be said for omitting the illustrations, for in any case they will only go half through the volume, which will make it look a little odd, but we will do just as you wish about them. 33 Not only did Macmillan make clear what his preference as a publisher would be in this instance, he made it scarcely less clear that he did not himself regard the Wessex Poems illustrations as in any way intrinsic to the reading of the individual poems or to the integrity of the volume as a whole. The pressure was strong, however courteously applied, and in light of Hardy's long-standing personal ambivalence about the drawings it is perhaps remarkable that in his reply he should have resisted that pressure even as strongly as he did.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Typically, however, it was a tentative rather than an absolute resistance, and after saying that he would 'like the question of sale to decide the matter' he was left in no position to challenge the practical publishing considerations promptly re-invoked by Maurice Macmillan, acting in his brother's absence: 'we do not think the sale of your Poems would be injured in the Wessex Edition by the absence of the drawings, and as the originals are not in your possession we should advise leaving them out'. 34 There was apparently no further discussion of the issue, with the result that while the texts in Wessex Poems were substantially revised for the Wessex Edition they were indeed deprived of the drawings by which they had been previously accompanied. 35 Nor does there seem to have been any suggestion that the drawings should be reinstated in the Mellstock Edition volume of 1920, even though the text itself was, in effect, brought up to date. As Hynes's edition shows, corrections and revisions to Wessex Poems texts continued to be incorporated into various impressions of the Uniform Edition, the Wessex Edition, and the one-volume Collected Poems (first published in 1919), but no occasion arose--or was created--for the restoration of the illustrations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardy did not, however, lose sight of them or of their importance, both to himself personally and to the poems with which they belonged. His very preservation of the envelope of extracted illustrations as late as September 1926 seems evidence of this, as does the distinctly wistful letter he wrote to Frederick Macmillan on 29 January 1927, less than a year before his own death: A friend has asked me for a copy of Wessex Poems with the illustrations that were reproduced from my drawings. I think the Uniform Edition still retains them: if so please let me have one. By the way if it should ever be necessary to print them afresh on account of their being worn, or owing to any fancy of collectors, or you should want to get at the originals for any reason, I may mention that they are in the Birmingham Museum. ( Collected Letters , vii. 57.) Hardy, who had recently been signing the 525 sheets required for insertion into Macmillan's three-volume large-paper edition of The Dynasts , 36 was perhaps envisaging a similar edition of Wessex Poems . Not only was he disappointed in that ambition but there would seem to have been no publication of an illustrated Wessex Poems between that final Pocket Edition printing of 1928 and the appearance of the first volume of Hynes's edition of The Complete Poetical Works in 1982. The drawings in Hynes's edition, however, are with one exception modified in size--from reduction by half to enlargement by a third--and, although skilfully placed and sharply reproduced, their impact cannot wholly replicate the experience of encountering the illustrations in their original locations and proportions. It is therefore both interesting and useful to find closer approximations to that experience being offered by two recent publications--a photographic facsimile of the London 1898 Wessex Poems (Oxford: Woodstock Books, 1994) and a page- for-page, line-for-line resetting of the same edition with photographic reproductions of the original drawings (Keele, Staffordshire: Keele University Press, 1995). Hardy himself would doubtless have been gratified by these initiatives, and Hardy scholarship can only profit from the prospect of increased and enhanced exposure to one of his most remarkable and complexly protean works. 37</field>

      <field name="fulltext">34 Letter of 11 October 1912, Macmillan letterbooks, British Library Add. MS. 55509. Since the Wessex Edition was being printed and marketed essentially as a set, sales of Wessex Poems were in any case unlikely to be much affected by anything other than the sales of the edition as a whole.

Its weaknesses consist in its not in fact getting everything exactly right (for example, the illustration to 'The Peasant's Confession' faces outwards instead of inwards) and in the simple fact that while the illustrations, with their generally unshaded backgrounds, may faithfully represent what Hardy originally drew they are often at some distance from the illustrations as actually reproduced in 1898. The Woodstock facsimile, on the other hand, does possess the cardinal advantage of 'virtual' authenticity, though the volume's attractiveness is somewhat marred by the thickness of the photographically reproduced type and the darkness of some of the illustrations.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Eliotiana by ARTHUR SHERBO</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite the admirable work by Donald Gallup in his T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (1969) and by Beatrice Ricks and Mildred Martin in their compilations of secondary writings on Eliot, 1 a number of items by and about Eliot can be added to their accounts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several pieces by Eliot that are absent from Gallup appeared in The Cambridge Review (hereafter CR ), a "Journal of University life and thought" founded in 1879. The first, which has also been reprinted 2 , is his review of H. F. Stewart's The Secret of Pascal in CR for November 19, 1941 (63: 124). In 1931 Eliot had published "The Pensées of Pascal" as an introduction to an edition of Pascal's work, and students of Eliot may wish to compare that essay with the review. To my mind, the insights of the review are more important than those of the earlier piece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A second item from CR (51: 492) is an unnoted Italian translation, by Raffaello Piccoli, of "Ash-Wednesday I" that appeared in the 1929-30 volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LE CENERI (Ash-Wednesday I) Perch'ìo non spero di tornare più Perch'io non spero Perch'io non spero di tonare Desiderando altri doni altri poteri Io non aspiro ad aspirare a tali cose (Perchè aprirebbe la vecchia aquila le ali?) Perchè lamenterei La perduta potenza del consueto regno?</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Perchè io so che il tempo è sempre il tempo E il luogo è sempre e solamente il luogo E ciò ch'è attuale è attuale per un tempo solo E solo per un luogo Io mi rallegro che le cose siano come sono e Rinuncio il beato volto E rinuncio la voce Perch'io non spero di tornare più Pertanto io mi rallegro, dovendo costruire qual che cosa Di cui io mi rallegri</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Piccoli himself was a poet, critic, and Dante scholar. He translated three plays by Shakespeare ( Hamlet , Julius Caesar , and Othello ), other ones by Robert Greene, George Peele, and Christopher Marlowe, and the poetry of Shelley; in the 1920s he contributed some "Letters from Italy" to The Dial .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the letter with the caption "Austrian Book Committee" that appeared in the Correspondence section of CR on April 26, 1947 (68: 400) was not written by Eliot, his name is one of sixteen appended to it. As I find nothing about this in Peter Ackroyd's biography of Eliot (1984) nor elsewhere in the literature on Eliot, it merits extensive quotation. I quote from the first of two long paragraphs, noting that the second bears the information that the signatories, whose names are listed, are trying "to organize a collection of the more important books and periodicals bearing on the humanities and the social sciences published in this country since 1938, and to arrange their transport to the Austrian National Library in Vienna." Sir--There must be many, not only professional scholars, who feel an anxiety to give what present help they can in the task of restoring the stricken centres of learning on the Continent so that each can again make its special contribution to our culture. This is to draw attention to the urgent need of scholars and students in Austria, particularly in Vienna … Their intellectual isolation is such that they lack the means even to discover what work has been done and what books have been published outside Austria since 1938, still less to procure any learned publications of which they may happen to hear word. The need is especially pressing in the humanities and social sciences, where valiant attempts to renew a great tradition and to shake off the effects of long Nazi censorship are frustrated by want of the barest minimum of literature required for renewed integration with Western scholarship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1931, Eliot added his voice to a discussion about Jacques Maritain in The Dublin Review . Montgomery Belgion had reviewed Maritain's Art et Scolastique and its English translation by J. F. Scanlan in the October 1930 issue (187, no. 375: 201-215). His unflattering comments prompted a reply from Maritain in the January 1931 issue (188, no. 376: 134- 135), with a rejoinder in turn from Belgion (pp. 135-136). Though the exchange merits the attention especially of students of scholastic philosophy and art, it is of interest as well for Eliot's role. In Maritain's letter to the editor, he had written, Au surplus je tiens pour périmée la dispute du classique et du romantique. Avouerai-je que devant certains défenseurs des éternels principes classiques je trouve au romantisme des charmes enivrants. Que T. S. Eliot me pardonne, pour qui j'ai tant d'admiration et d'amitié. Il sait bien d'ailleurs que ce n'est pas à lui que je pense ici. Eliot contributed a polite demurrer to those lines. His letter appeared in the next issue (April; p. 313) under the heading "Classicism and Romanticism." He stated that he wrote "primarily from the flattery of being mentioned so charmingly by Mr. Maritain, who should know very well my very high opinion of him; but secondarily to cast doubt on two of his sentences." Maritain had admitted that " devant certains défenseurs des éternels principes classiques je trouve au romantisme des charmes enivrants ," to which Eliot objected that Maritain was not contrasting "classical theory with romantic theory, nor classical works with romantic works, but certain critics (I suppose) with certain poets." He agreed with Maritain "that the `dispute' between classicism and romanticism is périmée ; but then it always was." And he went on to suggest that the two terms do not mean "quite the same thing for any two people, or for any two decades," and they even shift meanings in other ways.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One other piece by Eliot has also been overlooked. The first issue of The London Magazine (February 1954) printed a letter on the death of Dylan Thomas signed by Eliot, Peggy Ashcroft, Kenneth Clarke, Walter de la Mare, Graham Greene, Augustus John, Louis MacNeice, Edwin Muir, Goronwy Rees, Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, Vernon Watkins, and Evelyn Williams. It reads in part, "The death of Dylan Thomas at the age of thirty-nine is an immeasurable loss to English letters. In memory of his poetic genius a fund has been started for the establishment of a Trust to assist his widow in the support and education of his three young children." The letter provides details about the administration of the Trust and concludes, "We earnestly hope that the response to this appeal [for contributions] will be both immediate and sustained." Although Eliot had written "A Message" (known) congratulating the editor on the appearance of the London Magazine (1.1: 15-16), his signature, the first, on the letter has been overlooked, and I have found no mention of the letter or the appeal in the biographies of Thomas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A number of early secondary materials about Eliot likewise have not yet been recorded. Neither Ricks nor Martin includes G. Martin Turnell's review of Ash-Wednesday ( CR , 52 [1930-31]: 14), though Martin does list two other pieces by him (items 476 and 611) from that periodical. James M. Reeves, playwright, poet, editor, and drama critic, wrote on Eliot's essay "Hamlet and His Problems" from The Sacred Wood in 52: 111 (Martin lists a different CR item 1170 by Reeves). Hugh Ross-Williamson, playwright, novelist, and biographer, is represented by seven items in CR in Martin, but not the piece on 52 (1930-31): 318, which antedates those others. This short essay, "T. S. Eliot and His Conception of Poetry," also appeared in The Bookman of London (79 [March 1931]: 347-350), with two portraits of Eliot. (Ricks lists The Bookman but not CR .) A year later Ross-Williamson's The Poetry of T. S. Eliot (1932) expressed "my gratitude to Mr. Eliot for his kindness in supplying certain facts of which I have made use in this book, and for the stimulus of his conversation." The essay should be compared with the pertinent parts of the book. W. G. Archer's "McKnight Kauffer and T. S. Eliot" (52: 369-370) particularly deserves resurrection, as it deals with the "American artist and commercial designer who illustrated many of Eliot's `Ariel' poems" and became one of his oldest friends. 3 Add to these A. C. Bouquet on After Strange Gods (55 [1933-34]: 348) and John Casey's review of Eliot's book on F. H. Bradley (85 [1963-64]: 198-199), and one has a considerable area of neglect. Casey, incidentally, dismisses the book on Bradley as "a competent, devout, and not highly original account of Bradley's epistemology; it no doubt thoroughly deserved a Ph.D. But has it any interest beyond this?" A. C. Bouquet was a writer on Christianity and other religions. He suggested that Eliot was on "firmer ground" as a literary critic than as an apologist for Catholicism, and he found that there was no "note of penitent humility" in him. J. M. Todd's review of Eliot's The Idea of a Christian Society appeared in the 1939-40 volume (61: 161-162) under the heading "Rome without Reason." I quote what I take to be the two most important sentences: I feel doubtful if any suggestions for a complete idea of a Christian Society could be successful in so short a space. I am quite certain that Eliot is most effective neither when he is analysing the situation nor when he is outlining the new society, but when he is indicating in the last section the ultimate attitude of man, which is the pre-condition of social change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The review by Casey of Eliot's doctoral thesis on the philosophy of F. H. Bradley was one of a relatively small number of reviews of Eliot's writings or of productions of his plays. Others that have been overlooked are John Hayward's review of The Family Reunion at the A.D.C. Theatre (64 [1942-43]: 179) and that of Joan Bennett of the same production (64: 215). The review by Hayward, Eliot's friend, of the A.D.C.'s production of The Family Reunion ends with a paragraph of literary criticism. The theme of The Family Reunion the Christian doctrine of sin and expiation, linked to the classical conception of the avenging Erinyes is deeply impressive and must seem so even to those who may be bewildered at first by the original method the author has used to enforce its significance. It is beautifully sustained in the pattern of the lives of two generations of a single family and by the freedom and aptness of the form of unresolved, accented verse Mr. Eliot has evolved for the purpose of conveying, at every level of emotion, from the commonplace of domestic gossip to the moments of poetic awareness, the thoughts and feelings of his characters. Joan Bennett wrote that "Mr. Eliot portrays the aristocratic family group and the individuals who form it with a fine sense of comedy. His verse medium sharpens the irony by contrasting the formal pattern of the metre with the vacuous or inane content of the speeches." She does not, however, neglect the theological aspects of the play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this volume also appeared D. J. Gordon's groundbreaking essay, "T. S. Eliot's Use of Dante in `Little Gidding'" (64 [1942-43]: 196, 198-199). Earlier studies of Dante's influence on Eliot were by Mario Praz in 1937 and Muriel Bradbrook in 1942; neither focused on Little Gidding . Gordon's essay is too long to quote, but it belongs squarely in any future anthology of criticism of Eliot. I might add that Gordon quotes a number of lines from The Divine Comedy and from Little Gidding to show how Eliot used Dante, particularly the last canto of the one and the last lines of the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One other CR review of an Eliot play that should be mentioned is Hugh Southern's response to the Arts Theatre production of The Confidential Clerk (77 [1955-56]: 74). Southern, a drama critic, did not like the play: "The whole of The Confidential Clerk is written at such low pressure, with such spurious insight into human personality, and with so little love of individual idiosyncrasy that it fails to come to life. It is a funny play and an ingenious play. The only thing wrong with it is that it was written by Mr Eliot."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">F. R. Leavis reviewed East Coker (62 [1940-41]: 268, 270) and stressed that "the author of Ash-Wednesday and its successors was, in the days of his critical influence, the distinguished advocate of impersonality" but that "these poems are intimately personal documents." The personal "note becomes at one point directly autobiographical," quoting "So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years" and the seven and a half following lines (p. 268). The review appeared in the February 21, 1941, number of CR and is listed in the bibliography appended to R. P. Bilan's The Literary Criticism of F. R. Leavis (1979), but not in Martin. Soon thereafter, in the summer 1942 number of Scrutiny (pp. 68-71), Leavis reviewed Dry Salvages and touched upon the same theme in a few remarks on East Coker , saying that "it is personal, running even to autobiography (it is the most directly personal poem of Eliot's we have)" (p. 67). The remarks on East Coker are repeated verbatim in Leavis's Education and the University (1948, pp. 98-99) with an added footnote: "Mr. Eliot, I think, would object to this way of putting it, but I don't know how to indicate the distinctive quality of the poem without using the adjective [`personal']" (p. 98). Leavis's criticism of East Coker stems, therefore, from his review of the poem in the CR , where it gets fullest expression. The bibliographies of secondary material on Eliot list Leavis's angry defense of East Coker in TLS (Sept. 21, 1940, p. 483) against a previously published review in TLS ( Sept. 14, 1940, p. 472), the latter of which is unaccountably absent from those bibliographies. The anonymous review of East Coker ended on a dismal note: "This is the confusion of a lost heart and a lost art. These are sad times, but we are not without hope that Mr. Eliot will recover both, finding even that hearts are trumps and that Keats was not far out about the one in the rift." Small wonder that he aroused Leavis's ire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Ricks lists at least one item from The Dublin Review , while Martin lists none, two items from that periodical also have been overlooked. W. W. Robson wrote a number of pieces on Eliot and they are duly listed, but his review of The Cocktail Party (with Helen Gardner's The Art of T. S. Eliot ) in 214, no. 448 (Second Quarter, 1950): 127-129, is one of the two not cited. As with the other pieces discussed here, I shall only whet the appetite of devout students of Eliot's work, quoting Robson to the effect that the "treatment of the language is tender and relaxed," the play "has a profound subject, and a subtler subject than a bare account of the plot might suggest," and the "artistry of the play is, as we should expect, impeccable." Robson's "tentative criticisms" revolve about the characters of Celia and Reilly whom he is unable "to accept fully." The other neglected piece is Ian Gregor's "The Critic and the Age: Some Observations on the Social Criticism of Matthew Arnold and T. S. Eliot" in 217, no. 462 (Fourth Quarter, 1953): 394-404. Ricks lists Gregor's "Eliot and Matthew Arnold" (note the changed order of precedence) in Eliot in Perspective: A Symposium , edited by Graham Martin (1970; pp. 267-278); Martin does not. Gregor used the first paragraph of The Dublin Review piece as an introduction to what may be considered, at the very least, a refaciamento of the piece in the periodical, if, indeed, it is not a new essay. The two should, of course, be compared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first piece devoted to Eliot in The New English Weekly (hereafter NEW ) was by Basil Bunting (1900-1983), described by Donald Davie in the Dictionary of National Biography as a poet and translator and as an acquaintance of Pound and Eliot. Bunting's essay on Eliot's poetry, "T. S. Eliot," appeared in the Sept. 8, 1932 issue (1: 499-500) and deserves to be widely known. It is listed in Basil Bunting: A Bibliography of Works and Criticism , ed. Roger Guedalla (1973), p. 95.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two reviews of Murder in the Cathedral came out almost cheek by jowl in NEW , with James Laughlin's "Mr. Eliot on Holy Ground" appearing on July 11, 1935 (7: 250-251) and F. Bunce's simply-titled "Murder in the Cathedral" two weeks later (7: 299-300). Laughlin's review is listed in Martin (not in Ricks), but Bunce's follow-up essay is not (nor in Ricks). Laughlin's piece is necessarily summarized in but two sentences: "Eliot has attempted a fusion of the classical and medieval dramatic formulas. Informal, intelligent criticism" (p. 72). The essay is reprinted in New Democracy 5, nos. 9-10 (January 1-15, 1935): 159-160, and readers may wish to read the whole there or in NEW . Bunce, who felt that Laughlin confined his review (or essay) only to some aspects of the play, with insufficient attention to the theme, sought to repair the omission. The only F[rank] Bunce in the British Library Catalogue of Printed Books to 1975 is credited with "Rehearsal for Murder, etc." (1956) and So Young a Body , a novel (1952). These two essays, or reviews, among the earliest criticism, different in nature from Laughlin's, may even be thought of as ground-breaking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The anonymous review, or notice, of The Dry Salvages in NEW for November 20, 1941 (20, no. 5: 44) is remarkably short, given the prominence of Eliot in the periodical. As it has been overlooked, I shall quote the whole. Admirers of "Burnt Norton" and "East Coker" and other admirers of Mr. Eliot's poetry ought to add this poem to their collection. It first appeared in "The New English Weekly" last March and has since been published in the American "Partisan Review" for May. As in "Burnt Norton" Mr. Eliot gathered together thoughts which had occupied him when he was writing "Murder in the Cathedral," the thought of the wheel and the still centre, and sometimes even used lines again ("Human kind cannot bear much reality") so here he excogitates the themes which were found in "Family Reunion." Some lines look further back, at the crab who came in "Prufrock," the withered flowers, Krishna and Arjuna of the Bhagvad-Gita, the "Lady whose shrine stands on the promontory," Madame Sosotris ("riddle the inevitable / With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams"). These came together,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here the past and future Are conquered and reconciled."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their place here illuminates their meaning where they were before. But the whole meaning is agony, "The bitter apple and the bite in the apple." It is the agony we need to see, but the resurrection is always off stage, while the cross is on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Austin Warren wrote an article titled "Some Periodicals of the American Intelligentsia" for the October 5, 1932, NEW (1: 595-597) and came to "Hound and Horn," of which he wrote, As for the range and point of view of the "Hound and Horn": T. S. Eliot was (and doubtless remains) one of the chief gods in the founders' pantheon; and both poetry and criticism stem from Eliot. Now the critic and the poet, both admirable in kind, in Mr. Eliot consort ill together: the poet is a decadent and an Alexandrian, the singer of a dirge for dead men and waste lands; the critic is a philosopher, humanist (he still gives evidence of having once gone to school to Professor Babbitt), classicist, Anglo-Catholic. I take it that (despite "Ash- Wednesday") the poet in Mr. Eliot is chronologically prior and is giving way to the critic and theologian in Mr. Eliot; but the "Hound and Horn" adopts the two disparate Eliots as concurrent. (pp. 595-596)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was from this slight beginning that Warren went on to expand his views on Eliot as critic in articles in 1964 and 1966 and in the culminating chapter in his Connections (1970), reprinted from the article in the 1966 Sewanee Review . In a note in Connections (p. 201) Warren dates the first section of his essay on Eliot "not long after 1939," forgetting that the idea of Eliot's being a poet and critic concurrently was some seven years earlier.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Addendum: The Printing of the Plays in the Jonson Folio of 1616 by James A. Riddell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In considering the printing of the 1616 folio edition of Ben Jonson's Workes , I previously identified six different title-pages for Every Man Out of His Humour . 1 I have recently discovered still another form of that page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The six titles in the sixty-seven copies on which I drew earlier are linked with different states or settings of the conjugate text on G6 v :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">G1 r G6 v (1) In compartment; Stansby alone (1 copy) a (original) (2) Plain; Stansby alone (3 copies) a (original) (3) Plain; Stansby for Smithwicke (19 copies) [from (2)] a (original) (4) Plain; Stansby for Smithwicke; `Hor." in margin (6 copies) [from (2)] b (corrected) (5) In compartment; Stansby for Smithwicke (23 copies) b (corrected) (6) Plain; Stansby alone (9 small-paper, 6 large-paper copies) [reset] c (reset)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The new variant occurs in a small-paper copy I recently acquired:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(?) Plain; Stansby for Smithwicke b (corrected)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The characteristics of this new form suggest it falls into the sequence immediately before or after title-page (4). It has three features first noted in (4) the intact serif in `M[AN]', the abbreviation `Hor.' to indicate the source of the epigraph, and state b of G6 v while its basic form (plain; Stansby for Smithwicke) is last recorded in (4). But it differs from (4) in several respects: the ascription for the epigraph occurs not in the margin but in the center of the page, and that abbreviation is printed not in upper and lower case (`Hor.') but in large and small caps (`Hor.'). In addition, with `Hor.' now inserted in the block of text, the distance from `The Author B.I.' to the long rule below the intervening epigraph is 41.5 mm, rather than 34 mm as in (4). Because the distance is also 34 mm in variety (3), it would seem that the sequence (3)- (4) was not interrupted by the new form and that the new title therefore followed (4) rather than preceded it. Because the new title-page and variety (5) share distinctive features (41.5 mm from `The Author B.I.' to the rule, and the abbreviation `Hor.' in the same type and position on the page), the new one seems to have been printed immediately before or after (5). If the new form, then, was printed adjacent to both (4) and (5) in the sequence, it must have been printed between them, and in the current schema it might be designated as variety (4.5).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">According to this ordering, title-page (3) was modified to variety (4) by adding the ascription to the margin. The printer next moved that abbreviation to the center of the page (creating title (4.5)); he reset this short text using large and small caps and inserted it as an extra line of type, without removing a line of spacing. The ascription and epigraph then formed what proved to be a durable unit; they were kept standing and were used again even in (6), which was otherwise reset.</field>
