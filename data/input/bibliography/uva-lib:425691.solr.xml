      <field name="heading_text">Problems of Literary Executorship by Norman Holmes Pearson *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The creation of a literary executor spawns difficulties, but for the literary executor himself one problem comes first. It is not simply that he will be doomed to anonymity. Literary historians, though they frequently owe a debt to literary executors, seldom mention them. But literary executors are not always forgotten, as in the case of the triumvirate who acted as trustees for the Boswell papers, or that of the Rev. Dr. Rufus Wilmot Griswold who became infamous as the posthumous bedeviler of Edgar Allan Poe. Among shades like these the literary executor may hope to seek his modest immortality. This is the hope of a future existence. Yet the chief problem for the practising literary executor is that only too often he faces the actuality of a present non-existence. The typical last will and testament of a writer mentions specifically the person or persons to whose care he entrusts the disposition and use of his literary remains. Realizing that there will still be unpublished manuscripts after his decease, as well as correspondence and other personal material relating to his career, and recognizing—even hoping for—biographical and critical studies dependent on these, the writer looking toward posterity relies on a designated literary executor to be responsible and loyal to his memory. Since such a literary executor should be skilled as well as sympathetic, the proper person for the task is not always to be found in the immediate family of the writer or among his heirs. Too much is at stake for the nomination to be made carelessly. Normally he will search among his friends for the right one; sometimes he will turn to an acquaintance. A typical designation of a literary executor is that made by Mrs. Edith Wharton in her will, which reads: I nominate and appoint Gaillard Lapsley Fellow of Trinity College of Cambridge England to be my literary executor, and I hereby direct him to carry out this task in accordance with instructions left by me in my papers and with the assistance of anyone he may choose to call upon. A responsibility has been created in such an instance, but not a legal existence. Under this or any similar nomination there is no such thing at law as a literary executor. Under such circumstances he has no legal standing, he does not execute, and he has no powers. Literary remains are property, and are merely one part—though frequently a chief part—of the total property of the estate. As such, literary remains can be executed only by the true executors of the estate. At best the "literary executor"—to use that improper terminology, when he is not fully empowered as an executor—exists only in an advisory capacity. He may, as an expert both in literary problems and the wishes of the deceased, help the executors or beneficiaries in the disposition of the property concerned. But if the executors or heirs are, for one reason or another, unfriendly to the nominee, they may disregard him entirely and act toward the shadow of a wish as though he were merely a shadow. The fact that he has been designated in the will is not irrelevant but it is not binding. This situation is a matter of considerable surprise to many writers who may already have appointed or are contemplating the appointment of a literary executor on terms similar to those by which Mrs. Wharton named Gaillard Lapsley. It may also be, though hardly in her case, a matter of potential danger. For the writer is not always given the protection after death, which he thinks he has ensured. It is also a matter of significance to scholars and to institutions. What it means is that no literary executor of this type can himself give legal permission either for the use of or disposition of literary property, but that such legal permission for use or such legal deed of gift can be obtained only from the true executors or the beneficiaries of the estate, whose interests may be financially or otherwise affected. There is more than idle possibility of difference of opinion between a literary executor and others concerned with the estate. The gift of literary remains to an institution may, though it ultimately benefits the reputation of the writer, deprive the residual estate of immediate financial benefits possibly to be derived from their sale. The appropriate disposition of material of a sensational nature is another case in possible issue. Even the matter of using non-sensational material may occasion dispute, as in the instance of a choice among applicants for the privilege of writing a biography. Or one might cite, as specifically representative of more general problems, an instance in which some well-known dramatist might leave among his papers a manuscript play which has purposely remained unproduced and unpublished. There are various and understandable reasons for such a postponement: the play might have seemed to be of a too personal though non-sensational nature, or the author might simply but shrewdly have been moved by the possibility of providing an inheritance without undue burden of taxation. If the literary executor held final powers in himself, he might decide (a) that the prestige given by an eventual first production would be of immeasurable help to some little theatre or theatrical festival in which the dramatist had been or might have been interested; or (b) that the artistic prestige of the playwright required its initial production by a distinguished theatrical company but at lower financial returns than other companies would offer; or (c) that the spectacular fees from Hollywood or the television studios would, despite the necessary temporary revisions of the script, more than compensate for artistic considerations. But in this case as in others easy to conjecture, the ordinarily designated literary executor cannot decide; he can only advise, and have for his slender consolation the fact that because he has no legal existence he cannot be sued either for damages or in restraint of action. There are other potential problems affected by his legal status or lack of it. In the case of Mrs. Wharton's will, she mentioned specifically that her literary executor was "to carry out this task in accordance with instructions left by me in my papers." Precisely what those instructions were I do not know, but one can assume their nature from the instructions which accompanied the gift of her papers to the Yale University Library. These read: The correspondence and other letters and papers of a biographical sort shall not be accessible until thirty years after they have been received by the University Library. There is no question as to Mrs. Wharton's intent. She felt that the facts of her life would be of interest to the future, and that they might be of altogether too much interest to the present. Yet since these wishes were not apparently a part of the actual will but existed only in a supplementary letter of instruction, they were in no way legally binding either on the true executors or the heirs, and might therefore have been ignored. Under certain circumstances, financial or otherwise, even the worthiest efforts of a non-implemented literary executor might have been fruitless. In instances where there have been instructions for the destruction of manuscripts, or the prevention of their publication, whether permanently or for a limited period, only a specific clause in the will to that effect would have made the instructions legally binding. There are of course numerous instances where a decision has been necessary. Emily Dickinson's sister, Lavinia, destroyed most of her sister's correspondence immediately after her death, believing this to be her sister's wish. Somewhat later, however, she found large quantities of poems, and made every effort to preserve these and arrange for their publication. Edward Taylor, the American poet who died in 1729, is said in Sibley's Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University —there is no documentary instruction—to have given "orders that his heirs should never publish any of his writings," although Taylor obviously did not call for the destruction of the manuscripts themselves. Eventually in 1937 these were in part published, but only after the legal opinion was given that "there is no present legal force to such an instruction if it existed, and that if the University lawfully possesses these manuscripts the instruction does not legally interfere with their publication." "Personally," the legal counsel continued, "I can see no moral obligations after such a lapse of time." The moral situation is obvious; the legal situation has perhaps been helped by the passage of time. Franz Kafka left instructions to Max Brod, his literary executor, that his unfinished novels were to be destroyed. They were not; and if on publication these did not seem to be Kafka's masterpieces, they are at least cherished. Perhaps the most intriguing solution of a problem in this category was that made in the case of a nineteenth-century literary figure who left instructions that his manuscripts were to be destroyed. Among his papers was much unpublished writing of obvious merit. What in fact happened was that the heirs made copies of all these papers and then burned the originals. One can sympathize with the heirs and be grateful to them, but one does not know whether the author's wish was revealed orally, by written letter of instruction, or by a clause in the will. It might have made a difference to everyone, even to the deceased. I can sympathize also with the heirs of a well-known writer, still living, who has made it clear that he wishes no biography of himself. But since, as Serge Koussevitzky discovered, biographies cannot be prevented even in lifetime (though biographical novels may be regarded as invasions of privacy), biographies of this writer will certainly be written. Are these heirs to help to make these inevitable biographies as accurate as possible by their assistance, or are they, following his wish, to permit the biographers to proceed in darkness? Sometimes there appear to be considerations beyond the particular quirks or even the modesty of the deceased. But at least it should be evident that the writer who wishes to enforce his own intentions on the future may not always be able to do so through the simple nomination of an instructed literary executor, or at best to do so only within limits. For all decisions must be confirmed by the estate or heirs, under the limitations binding the average literary executor. The literary executor who is only that, can demand nothing (not even the sight of documents) as by his right, and he exists only by courtesy. It is possible, however, for a writer to act more definitively than he usually does, by eliminating the distinction between the "literary executor" and the other or true executors, or between him and the heirs. He may, for example, in order to effect the latter solution, make the literary executor a beneficiary by bequeathing to him the physical possession of properly defined literary remains, with powers to use them at his discretion. This may be done with or without giving this beneficiary the financial proceeds from the copyright aspects of the remains. But the literary executor whose physical property the papers now under these circumstances become, and to whom access to the papers cannot be denied (as is otherwise possible), can as their owner dispose of this physical property as he may choose, or permit their publication by right of the directive phrase: "at his discretion." The revenue from publication may flow to other heirs, but such a legal right obviates any discussion over the appropriateness of the financial returns. It will not, of course, remove the possibility of controversy or suit in relation to the possibility of libel, for which the literary executor under these circumstances may be sued if libel against any living person, including descendents, can be proved to result from publication. An alternative solution, in order to effect the elimination of the distinction between literary executor and true executor, would be to designate as a co-executor of the estate—that is, not simply as literary executor—someone whose particular forte is his knowledge of literary affairs. He will then be, so to speak, a specialist on an executive board, but one endowed with the fullest powers possible to any single executor. The limitation or definition of the powers of any individual executor may vary from state to state, but in any instance far more than merely advisory power will be given. There are certain pleasant or appropriate advantages to such an arrangement which go beyond the question of power, for by this procedure one can ensure to the literary executor the compensation normally received for executorial duties. It should be remembered, however, that such a full executorial appointment gives, in many instances, powers over matters beyond the purely literary, and warning might be taken if there are dangers in too celibate a literary skill unwedded to other capabilities. Sinclair Lewis was certainly aware of the fact that though he chose a poet as one of his true executors, the poet was also a lawyer and a member of the firm which handled his legal affairs. But in any event, or at least not uncommonly, even when the literary executor becomes a true executor, he will if there are other executors have only one vote in decisions; and although "one on the side of the Lord" may, as idealists used to repeat, be "a divine majority," more mundane decisions are not made in this fashion. Nothing has been ensured definitively. The independent decision of a specialist on literary matters may be irresistible but is not of itself always final. An interesting recognition both of the powers and the limitations in respect to a future situation is to be found in the will of Miss Willa Cather, the seventh paragraph of which reads as follows: I direct that my Executors and Trustee shall not lease, license or otherwise dispose of the following rights in literary properties written by me, viz: dramatization, whether for the purpose of spoken stage presentation or otherwise, motion picture, radio broadcasting, television and rights of mechanical reproduction, whether by means now in existence or which may hereafter be discovered or perfected; and I further direct that neither my Executors nor my Trustee shall consent to, or permit, the publication in any form whatsoever, of the whole, or any part of any letter or letters written by me in my lifetime, nor the use, exploitation or disposal of any other right therein. Realizing that certain of said rights in literary properties written by me may vest in my legatees under the provisions of this Will upon the renewal of copyrights therein, and that the right to publish letters written by me, and other rights in said letters, may ultimately vest in my legatees or distributees, I earnestly request such of my legatees and distributees as may acquire said rights neither to lease, license or otherwise dispose of any of them, nor to permit others to exercise such rights. It is not my intention, however, in making the provisions set forth in this paragraph "Seventh", to charge either my Executors, Trustee, legatees or distributees with the duty of bringing legal proceedings to restrain the unauthorized use of said rights, but I leave it to the sole and uncontrolled discretion of my Executors and Trustee in each instance, whether to proceed by legal action to prevent the exercise of any of such rights. Miss Cather was a woman of public reticence and of strong will. Like Mrs. Wharton she wished to avoid any public viewing of herself, but Miss Cather's will recognizes certain difficulties in regard to the future. This difficulty is indicated in the shift from her initial "I direct" to the second and precatory "I earnestly request." For when by the renewal of copy-rights the title to her literary properties rests with the legatees or distributees, or when the property rights to both paper and words rest squarely in them, theirs is the right to say what is done with this property, and theirs is the decision as to whether her "earnest request" is to be respected. The future must make its own decisions. All Miss Cather could do was to make the future as remote as possible. The way of a properly designated executor is comparatively sure; but the average "literary executor" can follow the path only by courtesy extended to him. Yet, fortunately, such courtesy is common. If the law is against him, ordinary practice is for him. Both the true executors and the heirs are customarily only too willing to place the burden of judgment, and frequently what is tantamount to responsibility for its exercise, upon the one named in the will to carry out such matters. The literary executor may not in many instances have any legal status, but he has an immense moral responsibility both to the living and to the dead. In most instances, except when he is a true executor, he receives no fee. Yet because he has an occupation of his own, the time and thought which he must spend as literary executor is at the expense either of his occupation or his leisure. What he does, he does willingly; but it is under a handicap. Since the chief concern of the deceased was usually his writing, the literary executor takes on as his side-line what is the virtual administration of some one else's chief line. The literary papers must be gone over and put into order. This in itself can be a full-time occupation for many months. Titles and copyrights ought to be put into order also, often when there are no funds for clerical or legal assistance. Most of all there is the writer's literary reputation to be preserved and enhanced. There is always the question of posthumous publication: whether it should be made, when it should be made, and how it can be made. There are critical articles and studies to be encouraged. Happily, these will, as in the case of F. Scott Fitzgerald, result in the achievement of a stature never known in the writer's own lifetime. The writer's miscellaneous published works ought to be brought together and made generally available. The Collected Poems of John Peale Bishop and The Collected Essays of John Peale Bishop were the consequence of literary executorship. The critical essays published on him after his death, as well as the reviews of the collections just mentioned, were not only tributes but services. They helped to establish the public memory of him. Gertrude Stein never enjoyed the critical interest in her lifetime which her work is now beginning to receive. After establishing the portrait of her magnetic character, an emphasis is now being made on the substance of her work. The result is not an accident, and it is not a miracle. Nor is it undeserved, but time is being helped. There is also the problem for the literary executor of the proper biography which most, though not all, writers both yearn for and expect. It is not a question of "first come, first served," as many enthusiastic suitors are unhappily surprised to discover. But it is not always appropriate for the literary executor to wait. One recalls the unfortunate consequences for Herman Melville. The privilege promised by Mrs. Melville to a friend was never accomplished; then the enthusiasm of another and younger man waned; other subsequent attempts were never carried through. Perhaps it might be argued that in Melville's case the resultant mystery helped. The normal literary executor of the normal literary writer could hardly, however, be expected to count on this; and the past is full of anonymous shades. Finally, because death will come for the literary executor too, and perhaps because having no existence he cannot appoint a successor to himself, there is the problem of the eventual disposition of the actual papers in such a way that both the writer and the public will best be served in the limitless years which stretch ahead. All these tasks of the literary executor are not thankless ones, but they are considerable. The mass of papers, literary manuscripts and other memorabilia which the average writer leaves among his remains is formidable. One can suggest many reasons why this problem should be an increasing one. The painstaking collection and analysis of literary documents of the past has, on the part of scholars, pointed up the value of such material, and has led writers to the day-by-day preservation of documents whose importance is constantly emphasized to them by collectors, scholars, and the alluring examples of book catalogues and auction records. Any writer is likely to regard himself not only as a Boswell but his heirs like Boswell's. Thus not only final manuscripts and literary correspondences have been saved, but, because of the interest in the study of the creative process, early notes and drafts are preserved which might once have been destroyed as no longer useful to the writer. The careful study by scholars of every scrap referring to biographical incidents or family influences, as well as an increasing lack of reticence on the part of writers and scholars, have led to the preservation of certain categories of documentation beyond perhaps even the consequences of the natural instinct of anyone to squirrel away souvenirs of the past. The waste-basket has been replaced by the literary muniment-room. A letter from Hervey Allen, written to me very shortly before his death, gives some idea of what his literary executor must have faced. "Actually," he wrote, " my problem is quite a complex one." I am a very methodical person in regard to records and correspondence. Over the years there has been an unbelievable number—thousands—of letters from people all over the world, literary and otherwise, and these have all been kept in carefully annotated and organized files, together with the replies. Amongst these letters are quite a number from most of my contemporaries. In addition to that, there are all the manuscripts of the several books, and the complete story of their publication,—reviews, comments, and all that goes with it. Scattered through this are all the business files of the administration of my own and several family estates. At the present time, part of this horde is stored at West Palm Beach, Florida [Mr. Allen was then living at Miami], representing the files and materials of about ten years at "Bonfield," on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I am now engaged in arranging for a shed in which to store this material down here, and get it all together with the correspondence of the war years, and the publication of books that have taken place since. In other words, to get the whole mass of material together and properly arranged in its sequence of monthly and yearly files. In doing that, I am calling in from Rinehart and Company, and other places, certain material which they have. Part of this is forced upon me because I must have, easily available and on hand, the records of the past years, in order to satisfy the Internal Revenue Department, which is forever pestering me with questions that must be completely and intimately answered as to why I did certain things in the past. As at the present time I am paying income taxes and agents' fees, etc. etc., in some twenty-one countries, you can see how complex it is, and yet how necessary. 1 Hervey Allen was unusually methodical, and in many ways was his own literary executor, doing himself what anyone else, without the advantage of his intimate knowledge of himself, would have been forced to do for him. Most writers are not so methodical, but their problems are similarly complex and ultimately compelling. Normally there are left, for the literary executor, simply crammed trunks, paper cartons in corners of attics, or miscellany in incredible closets like that which William Rose Benét used to refer to as his "glory hole." The papers of Alfred Stieglitz contained over fifty thousand items from more than ten thousand correspondents. The letters to Gertrude Stein now occupy eight well-filled drawers of filing cabinets; no one has ever had time to count them. Her literary manuscripts occupy shelf upon library shelf of black boxes. The papers of Mabel Dodge Luhan, who has wisely given up any even unwitting emulation of Hervey Allen, can be calculated only in terms of the 1575 pounds of literary remains which arrived at the Yale Library, and which are still being added to. These figures are of course niggardly in comparison to the 500,000 individual documents left by Josephus Daniels; or the 1,500,000 by Gifford Pinchot; or the approximately 3,000,000 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. But though not so deep as the Grand Canyon, nor so broad as some frontiers, "'twill do" for the literary executor. What does this mean in terms of his task? It means that until the literary executor knows what exists, he cannot use it properly. It means that the best he can hope to do at the beginning is to toss every letter to the deceased into one pile, and every manuscript by the deceased into another. This is at least a beginning. The literary executor can only pray for the postponement of the inevitable day when he will begin to receive requests by mail, or even visitors at his doorstep, who wish to use the letters which the deceased received or is thought to have received from whoever it is about whom the applicant is writing a biography or critical examination, a dissertation or an article. Then comes for the literary executor the task either of providing copies (which must of course be true copies) or of risking the originals to unknown hands. Frequently the request has seemed modest to him who has made it: he asks only that the literary executor sort out the letters (being sure that nothing has been omitted), and then study them in order to confirm or deny the questioner in whatever may independently have been deduced. Superficially regarded, such requests might seem easily denied. When a doctoral candidate has requested the shipment of all correspondence and manuscripts either directly to him or, "for safe-keeping," to the local public library in the hamlet where he teaches high school, in order for him to do a "definitive critical biography," the decision is less difficult. But it must be remembered that in order to keep the name of the deceased before the public, and emphasize the importance of his relationships and hence of himself, one of the best means is to have him cited as frequently as possible. Most requests are both legitimate and welcome. So, sooner or later, the correspondence must be ordered and the literary executor must become a research assistant for others. In the past it was not uncommon for correspondence to a writer to be returned to the originator. Such a propriety was observed, for example, by Horace Walpole, whose will requested "that all such manuscript letters which shall be in my possession at my death that shall not concern or relate to my estate or effects and shall be written by any person who shall be living at that time may be returned to the person or persons by whom the same were written. . . ." Today, however, all categories of letters to a writer are more commonly regarded as an aspect of his own personality, and retained among the whole. There is also the second pile of papers consisting of the manuscripts of the author's own composition. Starting to work with these, the literary executor must determine what has already been published and what has not, or whether a particular manuscript is an earlier draft of a work or a later, definitive revision. There is nothing easy about discovering what an author has published, especially if he is a poet or a contributor to periodicals. While most writers mean to keep track of things, few of them actually do. Comparatively few authors have had the distinction of bibliographies prepared during their life. Consequently one of the first tasks of the literary executor is to turn bibliographer, or if not that then at least a check-lister. Otherwise, and awkwardly, he may publish something which has already appeared in print. There are innumerable possibilities of error, not forgetting the recent incident when a poem "written by Miss Millay when she was twelve" turned out on publication in a magazine actually to have been her transcript of "Nest Egg" from Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses . As Vincent Sheean somewhat tortuously explained in the next issue of Vogue: "On the death of any real person innumerable phenomena ensue. Amongst these is the tendency on the part of all who have known that person to exaggerate the reality which has set the true one apart." The consequences may be occasionally unhappy, but there are few practising literary executors who will be without sympathy for the errors. The importance of the check-list becomes more imperatively evident, however, in terms of the possibility that the literary executor, without it as guide, may permit copyright to lapse. Since the question of copyright is of the utmost significance, the literary executor must make himself at least an amateur on copyright matters. American copyright law is based on the power of Congress, outlined in Article One, section eight, of the Constitution: To promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries. This copyright period, or monopoly, extends for twenty-eight years after the initial copyright has been taken out, with the right of renewal for a similar period on the part of the author or his immediate heirs. After this second period, or after the first if the initial copyright is not renewed, the writing enters into the public domain and may be printed without fee or permission. Since the American philosophy of copyright law is based not on the principle of protecting the author but rather, ultimately, of protecting public interest while giving the period of monopoly simply as an inducement to the author to contrive the expression of ideas, there is no sympathy for anyone who has failed to follow the letter of the law. The intent of the copyright monopoly was pointedly expressed by the late Chief Justice Hughes when he said: "The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors" ( Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127; 52 S. Ct. 546, 547; 45 L. Ed. 1010). The failure, therefore, to renew the copyright of a book originally published by a now defunct firm, obviously unable to remind the writer of his heirs that it is later than they think, puts the text in the public domain. In the case of publication by small presses—as early works so often are—such an eventuality is not at all uncommon. The later appearance of the same text or texts in subsequently copyrighted books (whose copyright may even have been renewed) will have no effect on anyone using the earlier appearance or arrangement. The appearance of an individual contribution to a composite work, such as a journal or magazine, may or may not be copyrighted either as a whole or in the name of the composite author. Each poem, story, or the like, which appears in a journal or periodical must have its initial copyright renewed (if it exists at all), if the item is not to enter the public domain and be free for all. Again, its subsequent appearance without alteration in a copyrighted book will not legally alter its status; although it is perfectly true that, in practice, publishing houses wishing to include such a technically free item in an anthology, generally (perhaps lest dog eventually be eaten by dog) treat the item as though it were properly copyright. It is not every writer who, to avoid loss, revises texts in order to give prolonged copyright life to the revised version. In England the philosophy of copyright is more definitely to protect the writer, and for that reason overall copyright extends for a period of fifty years after the death of the writer, before any item enters the public domain. This applies to all writings by a particular author, no matter when any one of them may have been published during his lifetime. On the other hand, in Italy the copyright reverts after expiration into the hands of the State, which thereafter licenses all publication. The ideal literary executor, therefore, will know foreign copyright law as well as his own. But there are limits to endurance as well as capacity. In the case of those writers whose works have a considerable market value, such matters can often be left in the hands of a paid literary agent. In most cases, especially that of poetry where the returns are slight and the difficulties many, it is not easy to persuade an agent to take on such a commission. The practical literary executor will wish to read some such book as Ralph R. Shaw's Literary Property in the United States (Washington, D. C., Scarecrow Press, 1950), and then turn to a lawyer. To repeat a chestnut: "'He who is his own lawyer has a fool as client." The question of common law literary property rights is somewhat simpler. A reasonable definition of this aspect of the use of unpublished texts has been given as "the right to control the public use of a manuscript up to the moment when it is first generally published." In the case of unpublished texts written by the deceased it is clear that the right either to publish or to prevent publication rests in the hands of the legally designated literary executor or of the heirs, and this right extends by law for perpetuity. The limitless endurance of this property right is of course constantly violated, in the letter of the law, by scholars, libraries, and the like. In the case, however, of substantial manuscripts written by Samuel Clemens but now in other hands, the prevention of publication by others than the heirs is still maintained. The basic considerations generally to be observed both by custodians and violators would seem to be those of financial return, invasion of privacy, or simply distance of time from the moment of creation. If the problem is not likely to be great for the literary executor handling the texts of the deceased, he should however be aware of the dangers of using correspondence written to the deceased, if published without the consent of the original writer of the letter or his heirs. The estate of the deceased owns the paper and the ink of the letter; it does not own the words in their particular arrangement. The converse will be true in regard to letters written by the deceased to others, permission to use the text of which must be given by the literary executor or the estate. That is, the recipient may dispose of the physical property in any way he chooses, even if this means the destruction of the words; he may not however publish these words without permission. The question of what to do with unpublished manuscripts has its serious aspects as well as embarrassments. Most writers and families of writers believe, even if secretly, in the merit of everything that he has set on paper. But not all publishers will irresistibly agree with them. Financial and critical judgments do not always coincide even when each is sound. In the case of Gertrude Stein the amount of unpublished material was considerable. William Carlos Williams, in his autobiography, gives an amusing account of his visit to Miss Stein's apartment in Paris: Tea was served, after or during which Miss Stein went to the small cabinet, opened it and began to take out her manuscripts, one at a time, telling us the titles and saying that she hoped some day to see them printed. I can't remember the exact sequence of what followed, but one way or another she asked me what I would do were the unpublished books mine and I were faced with the difficulty she was experiencing. It must have been that I was in one of my more candid moods or that the cynical opinion of Pound and others of my friends about Miss Stein's work was uppermost in my mind, for my reply was, "If they were mine, having so many, I should probably select what I thought were the best and throw the rest into the fire." The result of my remark was instantaneous. There was a shocked silence out of which I heard Miss Stein say, "No doubt. But then writing is not, of course, your métier." That closed the subject. . . . But it would not close the subject for a literary executor. Miss Stein, as it happened, made things easier in her case by providing in her will for the funds out of which, if necessary, everything could be published. But such funds do not always exist, though equivalents of her belief in herself do. It is then that the literary executor must go about with manuscripts in hand, or seem to fail both the responsibility to the deceased and the expectations of the family. It is easy to shift the burden by a confidence in future generations, but posterity is not infallible. Nevertheless to bring everything before the public, even when it is possible to do so, may not be advisable in terms of the critical response. No one will ever know whether or not it was better for Bridges to wait with the manuscripts of Gerard Manley Hopkins. At moments certain manners of writing are out of critical fashion. When they are, they are passed over without notice. How is the literary executor to know what is best to do? Yet in any event some attention must be called to the writer, and to this end both friends and students can be stimulated to help. Sometimes the students and scholars and critics come without bidding. Should the arms of the literary executor be opened, and his eyes closed? If the treatment of the writer is sluggishly done, yet encompasses the majority of fresh data, better men may be scared off. Particularly in a time when the scholarly profession is eager for publication, a literary executor is flooded with requests for material, without any proper idea of what the result will be. Altogether too often one suspects that he who asks is moved not so much by interest in the subject as by self-interest. Altogether too often, also, the suppliant heart is pure but the critical strength is not the strength of ten. The literary executor is not always the proper person himself for the precise task at hand, but he is hard pressed to find the right one for it. And if he does, he cannot always give carte blanche, nor can he answer minute questions speedily and with ease. He seems therefore to block the way for others, and willy-nilly he slumps, or stumbles through his shadowy career. From these many problems the literary executor cannot escape, nor are they problems to be escaped (indirectly) by persons who wish to deal with any aspect of a more or less contemporary writer. But in the handling of the great bulk of material which I have mentioned as increasingly characteristic, and those demands made on the literary executor both for ordering and servicing it, there are possible solutions. The average apartment-dwelling author, no less than his heirs or his executors, finds it increasingly difficult simply to house such material, quite apart from the expense of time and money involved in properly caring for it. For this reason, as well as for advantages of taxation, an astonishingly large number of writers are turning over manuscripts and correspondences to university libraries even during their own life times. Even when this has not been done, the estate acting through or on the advice of the literary executor is apt to do the same and for the same reasons. Generally speaking, only the physical property rights are conveyed, while the common law literary property rights or copyrights are maintained by the estate. Certain advantages are clear. For without expense to the heirs or to the literary executor, a university library will put the material into order, and, following the instructions given to them, will take over the substantial correspondence about it which inevitably follows as others wish in one way or another to exploit the material. They will also see, to further their own interests as well as in gratitude for the privilege of housing the manuscripts, that the collection is increased in scope from time to time as opportunities are presented. They will provide proper working facilities for those scholars who are privileged to use them, as against the necessary invasion of the privacy of the literary executor's own study or office. The university library will even have closing hours, and be shut on Sundays. At least the public repository will provide these advantages to the literary executor, if the proper one has been chosen. The choice is not always easy. A local historical society, in the region where the author himself lived in pleasant isolation, may seem sentimentally appropriate. Local pride will demand the deposit of material there on the basis of loyalty. But sentiment is not enough, if there are not proper funds nor skilled personnel to care for the material as it should be cared for. Nor will the reputation of the writer be maintained if the chosen library is so remote that great expense must be incurred by any great number who wish to consult the materials. Each generation may write its own biography, and such a biographer will certainly travel anywhere and stay there until his book is done. But for every biography there can be hundreds of articles, or references to the writer in minor but significant connections, and it is for the authors of these that distance does not lend enchantment. In such cases the scholar is only too likely to be unable to go at all. A writer may have been the chief literary figure of a remote state; a collection of his papers there may give its aid to the cultivational development of the state, but the decision in terms of the writer's national reputation (or of general public interest) will not be an open-and-shut matter. For writers do belong to the nation as well as to a township. Nor will the reputation of the writer be helped, no matter where his papers are placed, if it is the policy of the university library to restrict the use of the material chiefly to its own students. Yet such a policy is understandable even if it is somehow lamentable. Not only are most universities weak in their ability to provide exploitable material for their students and faculties, but the expenses which they inevitably and to a substantial degree incur as custodians must be justified in terms of that library's particular budget. The donors of papers, like donors of buildings, must realize that the cost of maintenance cannot often be ignored. And it is equally true that librarians, like university administrators, ought constantly to be aware of the implications of expense which arise from the acceptance of a physical gift. These are, at any rate, matters for the literary executor to clarify in his own mind as well as to ensure clarification in the mind of the donee. What the literary executor and the estate can themselves escape through this partial shift of burden to the shoulders of libraries, the libraries only take on themselves. It is for this reason that one hears more and more frequently the suggestion that perhaps libraries in time will insist on either the eventual right to a proportion of the financial return from the publication of manuscripts or at least the immediate funds necessary for an ordering of the papers. The resolution of the problem of justifying library expense by restricting the use of manuscripts to a local faculty or their students seems, in terms of the reputation of the author, often less than satisfactory. The matter of regarding the literary papers in a writer's estate as a marketable asset cannot be ignored by the literary executor, although it is likely to develop as one of his chief embarrassments. Many writers have looked on their papers as their chief benefaction to their heirs. Many writers unfortunately have little estate beyond these papers. The difficulties attendant upon marketing these papers are, however, many; and the tension arising between their status as monument and as financial asset is great and not easily to be resolved. If the physical possession of the papers passes through sale into strange and private hands, the papers are no longer available to the literary executor for those services which distinguish his duties from those of the ordinary executor of average property. For the private purchaser of these papers, their continued use by a literary executor would be to deprive him of a chief asset as a collector of rarities. Nor will the papers inevitably be available to scholars or critics for whatever services they may render to the reputation of the deceased. The private owner of occasional papers of an author may be willing to make these available, but it is the unlikely purchaser of a total literary estate who will either be willing or able to house and service them in the necessary manner indicated earlier in this paper. In actual fact it is difficult to find the individual collector who is willing to take on the burden of such a collection, especially since he has not usually been able to purchase the literary rights to this property, and therefore owns only the paper and ink. How difficult it can be, as well as how comparatively unrewarding, is indicated in the incident related by Mr. David Randall, who in his capacity as head of Scribner's rare book department was asked to market the papers of Thomas Wolfe. Having vainly peddled the 35,000 pages of Wolfe's own manuscripts and the 10,000 letters and telegrams for $5,000, he finally was able to sell them to a private collector for $3,000. The collector, apparently faced with the demands attendant upon owning them, soon presented the collection to Harvard. Occasionally benefactors are to be found. The Hervey Allen papers were purchased by the University of Pittsburgh under a grant from The Buhl Foundation; the Emily Dickinson papers came to Harvard through the generosity of an alumnus. A certain degree of luck is, however, necessary for the sale of any literary estate as a whole. Libraries themselves are almost never able out of their own limited funds to purchase what they would so much like to acquire. I can think of at least three major and desirable literary estates of famous American authors which are, and in two instances have been for some years, going begging. The wish to sell papers as a lot (so that they will preserve the monumental value of the whole) in order to advantage the heirs seems generally doomed to disappointment. And if they are sold as a whole to anyone except to a public institution, there cannot of course be any real guarantee that the private collector or his heirs will maintain them as a whole. The papers have become his physical property, or that of his estate, and he can do with them what he will. The papers are not likely to be destroyed (though they could be), but they are likely to be offered for sale in lots. This, then, would be only to postpone what the literary executor may have wished to avoid: the damage of the scattering winds of chance. It is easy, and sometimes profitable, for the literary executor or the estate simply to split up the papers into lots for sale on the open market, or to profit from the sale of the more desirable items. But the monument has disappeared, and all the advantages that go with it. Once the dispersal takes place, then it will require a Wilmarth Lewis for a Walpole, or a Beinecke for a Robert Louis Stevenson, to bring the papers together again. There can be no absolute advice on the advantage or propriety of the sale of literary remains. Everything must inevitably depend both upon circumstances and exigencies. It is perhaps useful, however, to suggest how often literary executors and heirs, sometimes after disappointing attempts to sell the papers or after they have weighed the advantages to the estate against the advantages to the memory of the deceased, come in the end to place them in public institutions where they can do the most good to the memory of the man who created them and whose monument they become. No matter how much the law may emphasize that literary remains are simply property, like other property, the problems connected with their use and eventual disposition are special ones. For the writer, like his products, occupies a peculiar position both in life and afterwards. The author has had his own life, but in a very real sense he himself because of his genius has become public property. Public interest as well as private interest are therefore involved. Perhaps the principle of copyright provides an analogy to the situation which the literary executor faces. The writer is protected to some extent during his lifetime, as though by the first period of copyright, and for another span afterwards by the agency of his literary executor who serves in the guise of a renewal of privacy and monopoly. Thereafter the writer and all his literary remains actually enter more and more into the public domain. It is in order to make as easy as possible the metamorphosis from first stage to last that the literary executor exists. The execution of this duty is the basic problem with which the literary executor must be concerned, but for many others as well as for himself the literary executor is the embodiment of the problem.

      <field name="heading_text">Establishing a Text: The Emily Dickinson Papers by Thomas H. Johnson *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was fifteen years ago this month that I first saw the manuscript volume which Edward Taylor had assembled during his long life as pastor in Westfield, Massachusetts. He had labeled it his "Poetical Works," and bequeathed it at the time of his death in 1729 to his descendants with the injunction that the poems should never be published. At the time, I thought the problems ahead were very challenging. And so, no doubt, they were. First of all, would scholars and lay critics share my belief that Taylor deserved to be published? Would the Corporation of Yale University—the legal heirs—grant permission in the light of Taylor's prohibition? Could one learn to read Taylor's handwriting? Most important, would the pattern of a poet emerge? As I say, this was several years ago, and seems at this remove, when all the questions are answered, a simple story. For there was but one heir: a notable institution that seeks advancement of learning. There was but one manuscript: a 400-page volume assembled by the author in orderly fashion. The handwriting was never, or almost never, an obstacle. And there was no copyright problem at all. With Emily Dickinson I again feel challenged, and all the problems seem even more complicated. Perhaps they are. Or perhaps I'm beginning again. In either event, I accept the challenge and enjoy the fun. Though Dickinson never requested that her poetry remain unpublished, the fact is that at the time of her death in 1886 her poems were still in manuscript. The mere handful published before then either were issued surreptitiously or were anonymous. She bequeathed them, along with her other effects, to her sister Lavinia, who with passionate singleness of purpose determined that they should be known, since to her, at least, Emily was a poet. Had the poems been left untouched until 1950, then to be transferred intact to a learned institution, the parallel with Taylor would be reasonably obvious. At this point the analogy breaks down. All who have had access to material touching upon Emily Dickinson's life and writing agree—I think without exception—that she knew during her twenties that she was uncommonly gifted; that by the time she was thirty-one, when she sought advice from Thomas Wentworth Higginson in the now famous letters written in April, 1862, she did indeed crave assurance regarding a talent which at times literally overwhelmed her. "Alone I cannot be," she wrote at this time in a remarkable poem: Alone I cannot be; The hosts do visit me, Recordless company Who baffle key. How was this gift to be shared? She must have been somewhat prepared to accept Higginson's hesitation to advise publication, for it matched the opinion of other writers and critics whom she knew and respected, gentlemen who knew something of her writing, notably Samuel Bowles and Josiah Gilbert Holland. She should delay submitting any letters to the world, they all told her in effect, until she had learned "control." Since she could no more "control" the quality of the hosts who visited her than she could alter her wren-like size, she must therefore, in her own lifetime at any rate, sublimate her desire for public recognition, however compelling the wish for it may have been. That the longing was present seems beyond doubt. In the first place, it was within the months just preceding her first letter to Higginson that she began to make copies of her poems, presumably from original drafts that were then destroyed. These early original drafts do not now exist and there is no record that they survived her. Perhaps she disposed of them as, one by one, she transcribed them into packets or fascicles. Written fair, these assemblages of anywhere from ten to twenty transcribed verses are the gatherings, threaded loosely at the spine, which she laid away in her cherry bureau. The number of poems so transcribed during the years 1861-62-63 is very large indeed. On the evidence of stationery and of handwriting—and much will be said about both later—this large body of verse, fully half of all her extant poems, belongs in these three years. A packet or two may have been completed as early as 1858, but there are none at all for the years preceding. In fact there is not to my knowledge a single poem which in its present transcription can be safely assigned an earlier date. The conclusion therefore is inevitable either that she wrote verses at white heat for a period of three or four years at the turn of the decade as she passed her thirtieth year, or that the packets assembled at that time represent fair copies made from drafts which had been accumulating for the previous eight or ten years, roughly from the time she was twenty. Unless the originals, which certainly must have existed, are recoverable—and there is no reason to think they are—the issue can never be resolved by direct evidence. It is outside the province of this paper to try conclusions, and the process of editing the Dickinson papers has not yet advanced to the point where final speculations are warranted. I cite the problem, however, as a major example of the nature of the work involved in establishing a provenance of Emily Dickinson's poetry and the order of its composition. The task is further complicated by the fact that she seems to have had no discoverable design in the order of the packets or of the poems within a packet, and that since her death the packets have been handled, separated, and reassembled by several hands. The possibility of confusing the original order—if one did in fact exist—has been multiplied by each handling. If these packets represent Emily Dickinson's copying of her earlier drafts, and if the earlier drafts are irrecoverable, then an exact chronology of actual composition can never be established. A terminus ad quem date must therefore, certainly for the most part, be all that we can expect for the poems which we conjecture she composed in her twenties. So far I have emphasized Emily Dickinson's compulsion to write poetry and to preserve it as she wrote it, with its half-rimes, broken stanzas, unexpected figures, even though the advisers she consulted counseled greater smoothness and regularity, with fewer oddities of thought. I have pointed out the difficulties that beset an editor of her poems who attempts to establish chronology, at least down to 1863 when she seems to have been convinced that publication in her own lifetime was out of the question. At about this time she began to develop a new medium for her verse, and a way of sharing it with her friends. She incorporated whole poems or parts of them in almost every letter she wrote. Such had not been markedly true earlier. She had always been a notable letter writer, from the time that her earliest extant letter, written to her brother Austin when she was eleven, shadowed forth the sensitive perceptiveness and originality which are her special genius. By the time she was thirty her contact with the world, except for the few members of her immediate family, was almost solely through correspondence. This she now freighted with poetry. Complete poems might thus be conveyed. Or it might be but two lines, or a quatrain from some longer poem recently transcribed into a packet, but here adapted by the change of a pronoun to apply to a particular recipient or situation. Sometimes the poems are archly disguised as prose. From an editorial point of view such readings must be treated as variants. Often a letter is solely a poem; it usually is without salutation, but is signed "Emily." The text of one such was recently acquired by the Library of Congress. It consists of two quatrains, and the handwriting as well as the content suggest that it was inspired by a homesick mood during her enforced stay in Cambridge where in 1864 she underwent eye treatment. It is written in pencil, because during these months the physician forbade her to use a pen. Away from Home are Some and I— An Emigrant to be In a Metropolis of Homes Is easy, possibly— The Habit of a Foreign Sky We—difficult—acquire As Children, who remain in Face The more their Feet retire. Emily. The poem was first published in the 1894 edition of the Letters among those, Mrs. Todd notes, "sent to the Hollands at various times." Presumably all the Holland letters published in 1894 were returned to Mrs. Holland and subsequently destroyed, but the poem as it appears in the 1931 edition of the Letters is printed as two quatrains (not as in 1894 as a single eight-line stanza), and offers an alternative reading for the fourth line. Presumably therefore Mrs. Todd had seen another version before she brought out the 1931 edition. She sent this letter-poem to some member of her family in Amherst, probably to Sue, her brother Austin's wife. It presents a textual problem that is not unusual, and one that is especially interesting because it may never be satisfactorily solved. The Library of Congress holograph is the only manuscript version I know to be extant. It differs from the published versions chiefly in its fourth line which reads "Is easy, possibly." ("An Emigrant to be / In a Metropolis of Homes / Is easy, possibly"—not "Is common possibility.") And it offers no alternative reading. At this point an editorial footnote is demanded, and unless further information alters the conclusion, it will go something like this: "The letters to Dr. and Mrs. J. G. Holland, published in 1894, were returned to Mrs. Holland after they were transcribed, and presumably were destroyed. Access to a second manuscript, with an alternate reading offered for the fourth line, must have occurred before 1931. The single-stanza version Dickinson sent the Hollands probably substituted common for easy , and may have shown no stanza division. Such variants in wording and stanzaic form are not exceptional when the same letter-poem is written to more than one correspondent. Unless the hypothetical second manuscript proves to be extant, and can confirm the reading of the 1931 text, one queries the substitution of possibility for possibly . Is it a copyist's or printer's error? It renders the line meaningless and destroys the meter." The purpose of any editorial task is to establish as definitive a text as possible, and to give it a chronology. For Emily Dickinson, it will be to edit all poems and letters known to exist, to give them order, and to place in context, as far as possible, those which, once published, were ultimately destroyed. Of the near 2000 poems known to have been written—most of them already published—a very large number exist in holograph. Of the some 1200 letters, a much greater percentage are still unpublished; and of those in print, a great many were lost or destroyed subsequent to publication. For example, Emily Dickinson's correspondence with her cousins, Fanny and Lou Norcross, was fairly voluminous. It covered many years and was particularly intimate on a domestic level. The spinster cousins, shy by nature, permitted use of the letters for the 1894 edition with the proviso that every personal allusion to them or to others be deleted. On that basis the letters appeared, so blue-penciled as at times to be fairly uninterpretable. They were then returned to the sisters, and in the manner deemed proper for families of their status, were destroyed at the time of their death. Much that would help interpret other letters, or give better insight into Emily herself, is thus irrecoverable. The Norcross letters, and others which suffered a like fate, will continue to tantalize, never explain. But the large number of letters that do still exist are not only intrinsically important (for Emily Dickinson takes rank as a letter writer) but are of tremendous importance in understanding her verse and helping to give it a chronology. Probably no part of the editing of the Dickinson papers is more exacting than that which involves establishing chronology. Emily dated nothing after 1850, and after her death Lavinia with characteristic thoroughness burned all letters written to Emily. Three possibilities are open for assigning dates to the letters. First there is internal evidence. If it is direct, it is conclusive: "Father died a year ago today." But it often is circumstantial. "Perhaps the flowers wilted," she says in a letter written presumably in late summer, 1880, "because they did not like the Pelham water." The Amherst water supply was first piped in from Pelham earlier in that summer. Second, there is the handwriting. And finally there is the paper that she used. The degree to which these latter two possibilities can be effective is proportionate to the mass of manuscripts which can be studied. For Dickinson the volume is large. I do not hesitate to conjecture that her manuscripts can be dated within a twelvemonth, when the handwriting is checked against the evidence of the paper groups. I will shortly discuss paper groups. Let me say something here about Emily Dickinson's handwriting. A scholar's first reaction to placing dependence upon handwriting as a guide to dating a manuscript is apprehensive skepticism. Of course handwriting changes, but can the changes be interpreted in a chronology? I knew at the start that I would be compelled to seek an answer to the question, but I began with no assurance I would be led to conclusions which could be accepted. There are too many human factors. People are subject to moods which handwriting reflects. You write one way when you are rested, or another when you are in haste. The size of letters may vary with the size of the sheet written on, depending on how much you wish to say in a given space. The form and shape of the characters depend also upon the implement you use, as well as the quality of the stationery. A sharp, stiff pen gives results very different from those formed by a stubby pencil. A glossy ledger sheet permits a movement of arm, hand, and fingers that rough, resistant linen will not allow. Absorbent foolscap is something different still. Finally, I thought, let anyone allow a manuscript of his own, which he has no recollection of ever writing, to be placed before him for dating solely on the basis of the calligraphy; how close can he come? Within five years? within ten? Perhaps not even that. And if not, the use of handwriting will be more of a hazard than a help in attempting to establish a chronology for a poet, where the purpose is no less than to discover the growth of an artist. Yet when I had begun the task, which I knew was necessary to undertake even though the results after many tedious and discouraging hours might only lead into a blind alley, I found trustworthy patterns emerging. And now, after a year of intensive study of the Dickinson handwriting, covering the span of her years, I feel confident that great reliability can be placed upon a chronology that derives from it. Bear in mind that we are not working in a vacuum. Though no poem is ever dated, and no letter dated after 1850, there are many, many letters that can be assigned exact dates, either on a given day, or within a week or a month. For our purposes, that must be considered as close as we can ever get. Next, there is always the check we can apply by arranging manuscripts into paper groups. For the undated documents these three forms of evidence are the only possible ones which can be used. In many instances, that is, where no internal evidence is possible and where the paper is unidentifiable, the handwriting alone must furnish the clue. In such cases the degree of reliability is lessened. Yet it often happens that a poem, identifiable only by handwriting, is exactly duplicated in another manuscript that can be precisely dated. These cross-checks appear with enough frequency to buttress the confidence I have in our procedure. Let me now explain the way the Dickinson handwriting can be made to tell its story. First of all, I repeat that the effectiveness with which any handwriting can be used is proportionate to the mass and coverage available. We have both here. And obviously one proceeds from the known to the unknown. Setting the poetry aside to begin with, let us consider only the letters to which dates can be assigned through internal evidence. (And here may I digress long enough to say that photostatic reproductions for such work are essential. They are expendable. They can be handled, arranged, cut, and pasted onto charts for purposes of comparing formation of letter, line slants, the length of ascenders and descenders of g's, f's, p's, and so on; and in Emily Dickinson's case they tellingly reveal the story of her linked and unlinked letters.) My preliminary conclusion, reached after a tentative examination of all datable letters, is one I still hold: That it will be possible to assign a given year to any manuscript of sufficient length from evidence of handwriting alone. Such a calendar year must be assumed to extend a few months backward or forward. But with those reservations in mind, a chronology is possible within fairly limited periods in which manuscripts—and this is important—may be given their relative association . The second conclusion was that all writing in ink could be judged by commonly applicable rules, but that another set of rules applies to the writing in pencil. I prepared a loose-leaf notebook which would allow incorporation of specimens of four pieces of writing from each year of undated material—from 1850 to 1886. The plan was to place a photostat of two handwriting samples in ink and two in pencil, each representative of different periods in each year, chosen always from manuscripts that could be dated by internal evidence. The more samples per page the better, for thus one could determine whether variations were trivial or significant. Some pages still remain blank. For instance, there are several samples in pencil of writing in the latter part of the year 1864 and early 1865, but none in ink. Since these are the months she was under orders not to use a pen, it is unlikely that she would have done so. By extension, and because I believe she followed her doctor's orders, I doubt whether any document in ink will be found in that period. Similarly for the period after 1878. Why this abrupt adaptation? One cannot pursue a study of the handwriting without considering the problem of her eyes and the general state of her health. Why did the character of the letters balloon so in the 'seventies, and the letters unlink? Emily Dickinson's death was due to some form of nephritis. It may never be possible to establish the exact nature of the affliction, though it was then diagnosed simply as Bright's disease. But there are hypotheses that cannot be overlooked, even though they may ultimately remain suggestive only, for lack of sufficient proof. One not uncommon cause of a fatal nephritis is now known to be a deepseated streptococcic infection that becomes recurrent. The evidence for such in Emily Dickinson's case is striking. She was withdrawn from Mount Holyoke very suddenly and against her wish in the spring of 1848 by her parents, who sent Austin to fetch her home quite unceremoniously. They had heard indirectly that she was suffering from a severe throat infection that her letters home had tried to belittle. The recurrences were so continual through the next spring and summer that the family effectively prevailed in their demand that she give up thought of returning to the seminary. The letters she wrote during the 'fifties indicate her susceptibility to nose and throat colds. Injury to the kidneys was perhaps begun, though probably not known. It happens that this could have a great deal to do with her handwriting. Such organic injury, where it does exist, can in its early stages produce a partial blindness or periods of visual aberration that doom the victim to impaired sight. With Emily Dickinson it certainly had progressed far enough by 1864 to compel her trips to Boston, to doctor's orders that she use a soft pencil in place of a fine-pointed pen, and to an acceptance—later modified—of darkened rooms. As years pass, her neuroticism becomes clear enough, but the degree of its basis in a physical handicap is not clear and may never be established. By 1867 her writing certainly has increased in size and the letters within words are broken to a point that one reckons, not in terms of linked words or syllables, but in terms of those that are unlinked, so general has become the separation of letters. The process was so steadily continuous that by 1875 only an occasional of, th, or Mr . remained fastened. She was still writing most of her letters in ink, however. In this year the size of the letters she formed with her pen reached a maximum. By 1878 she evidently found it necessary to forego ink altogether, and no part of any word is linked after that year. But the size of letter decreased when she used only a pencil. From her nervous collapse in the early 'eighties till her death in 1886 the progressive changes become increasingly marked. I have inquired of physicians whether this increased size and gradual unlinking could have relationship to her vision and fatality. The evidence at the moment is inconclusive. But the bearing of her medical history upon the problem of her handwriting cannot be ignored, and the ultimate verdict will certainly include a study of her health. There are two areas into which handwriting changes fall: the general and the particular. The general includes characteristics involving five to eight-year periods. During the 1850's all words are linked, the writing is small and flowing, marked by a roundness that is almost copybook in its style. In these years she often signs her name "Emilie". The unlinking of letters begins in the early 'sixties and is well along to completion ten years later. The letters become progressively more angular, and the pages show a sense of drive and forcefulness. The "ie" for "Emily" is permanently discarded after 1861. In the 'seventies the size of the letters reaches a maximum, the use of a pencil is more frequent, and in the later years of the decade supplants the pen altogether. Particular changes are far more complicated and overlapping. Charts made of each individual capital letter for each successive year tell a story quite easy to follow, for each year some capital letters undergo striking changes not found in other letters. The same phenomena are observable in lower-case letters, with the further advantage that the alterations in the small letters can be subdivided according to their use initially, medially, and finally. For example, in 1859 her final "d" is formed by an upswept ascender curving right. In the years preceding and following it sweeps left. From '55 to '58 the small "h" used initially is hooked to the left. The list of these minute variations through the years is very extensive, and each serves as a reference to and a check upon the others. Given a sufficient number of words in any document, it is possible to assign a probable date within comparatively narrow limits. Since I have never tried before to study handwriting with the purpose in mind of dating a manuscript by characteristic changes in it, I cannot say whether all handwriting is so subtly variable. The progressive unlinking of letters, in this case over an eighteen-year period, is enormously useful, and made possible by a physiological change that perhaps is comparatively rare. In her case I believe it theoretically possible, if enough manuscript existed, and if each manuscript used enough letters in sufficient combination, to track down dates of composition within the limits of a given week. But the quantity of manuscripts is wanting, and even if they existed it would take years to compute and equate the frequencies without the aid of an electric eye and a robot tabulator. Our laborsome method of charts must remain but a very rough estimate where handwriting alone is the clue. At best, it must allow a margin of error measured in serveral months. At worst, as in instances where the documents are so brief that tell-tale combinations of letters do not appear, the probable limits of error can extend through two to three years. It is at this point particularly that we turn to paper groups for aid. Emily Dickinson was fastidious in her stationery selection. Whether it was wove or laid paper, it is almost invariably of an identifiable quality, and though over the years there is a great variety of it, when the types have been identified and grouped, a distinct paper pattern emerges. I suggest that for the moment we consider the rule, not the exception. It is true that she had several paper types at her desk at one time, and that she might on occasion use a sheet in 1875 left over from a batch presumably exhausted in the 'fifties. Such exceptions are easy to spot, and when they occur they rule out the aid which paper groups often can give. The task of arranging paper into groups is tedious in the extreme, and has not yet been completed. It involves identifying whenever possible (and it is possible 95 per cent of the time) every paper type that she used, measuring it, matching the groups, and sub-dividing them according to their millimeter measurements. Since the identification of a document by its group is desirable as a check on the handwriting, this work must be pursued with no reference whatever to handwriting or other identifying quality. Much of the laid paper she used was embossed with, say, a head of Minerva, or a capitol dome, or a basket of fruit, or the name of a stationer or manufacturer. The wove paper is generally watermarked and often dated. Let us suppose that all Weston's Linen 1868 paper has been identified and grouped, and that it totals 75 items. Millimeter measurements show that it falls into three sub-groups. That is to say, the sheets have all been folded once, to make four pages, with the spine vertical on the left, the way boxed stationery usually is sold. When we open it out for measurement, we find that the four outer corners for the entire quantity are identical in size. But the middle vertical measurements—the part that becomes the spine when folded—are in three distinct divisions: group A measures 180 mm; group B, 183 mm; group C, 177 mm. These groups, then, were trimmed folded, and represent three distinct batches. Let us say that the number of sheets in each group is roughly even, about 25 in each. Turn now to absolutely identifiable documents in each group. There are five in group A—all in the year 1872; ten in group B—covering 1874-75; eight in group C—all 1877-78. Turn back to group A. Of the remaining items in it, 20 had been dated about 1872-73 on the basis of handwriting; and three are unmistakably later. The remaining two are too brief to guess at closely from handwriting. They are clearly not later than 1876 nor earlier than '73. All that can be said of them is that they belong with group A, and fall within a pattern common to that batch. Now group B, where the ten identifiable items fall within the years 1874-75. Let us suppose that 12 of the 15 items remaining have been assigned dates, on the basis of handwriting, ranging from 1874 to '78. The remaining three had been classified as doubtful, with a tentative range of dates between 1872-74. I think it reasonable at this point to assume 1872 is too early a date for any paper in group B. It seems more likely that group A was purchased from the stationer and used sometime before group B; that group B, the same kind of stationery but from a different batch, was purchased later; that therefore the evidence of the group as a whole points to a date not earlier than 1874 for the three doubtful items. Similarly in group C, if but one item were conjectured to fall before 1877, I should think the burden of convincing us of the possibility would be more difficult, once the pattern of the group is shown to extend forward from that year, not back of it. For purposes of clarity, the illustration has been simplified, but it is representative of the use to which paper groups may be put. Evidence from it can never be final, nor can it be used except in conjunction with other evidence. But where it exists, it must be considered. I think it important to underline at this point that I am presenting problems, not reaching conclusions. To establish a text for Emily Dickinson, particularly of her poems, in terms of exact chronology will never be possible, for all the reasons that have been set forth. The evidence must derive solely from handwriting and from paper groups, and whether taken separately or together, they cannot do more than suggest areas of time. The most that can be done is to give the physical evidence in the greatest possible detail. It remains finally to say something about the text of the poetry. There would obviously be no problem if every poem were left in a single and final version. But such is not the case. At a rough estimate, I should say that 80 per cent of the poems exist in finished versions, copied fair, with no alternate lines or variant readings suggested. Of the remaining 20 per cent—some 400 poems—she offers variant readings, for the most part with no indication which reading she might ultimately have selected in a final version. Any editorial choice therefore becomes impossible in a definitive edition, since it can represent only an editorial preference. In one instance I thought she herself had provided a solution. One of the poems which she copied into a packet had several suggested readings for eight different words in the course of the five stanzas, but with no indication of her choice. (Sometimes, though infrequently, her choice is indicated by an underlining of the word she prefers, or by a deletion of the one she has rejected.) Then I found the same poem included in a letter to Higginson with choices made in every instance. Here, then, seemed proof that she had established her final version. But in another letter to another correspondent, written at substantially the same time, she has included the same poem—also evidently a final version—wherein she adopted six of the choices made in the Higginson letter, but selected two from among her variants in the remaining instances. If any conclusion is to be drawn from this citation, it would seem to be that there are no final versions of the poems for which she allowed alternate readings to stand in the packets. Later when anthologists are compiling selections for lay readers, they may do what they wish about selecting the "appropriate" version. The text for my edition in preparation must simply record the lines as she wrote them, noting the alternates and the variant readings. It would be misleading to give the impression that many such exist. Even of the 300 or 400 poems that show them, by far the largest part offer alternates for but one or two words in any poem. Some dozen or so work sheets exist: those scraps of paper which represent the first draft of a poem—often potentially a great one. They are the jottings which throw brilliant flashes upon the creative spirit in travail. Such is the poem "Two butterflies went out at noon," which has been reproduced in facsimile in Bolts of Melody . So far as I know, it never proceeded beyond the work-sheet stage. What shape she might finally have given it! But we sit, helpless to gain her insight, knowing only that such speculations "tease us past thought, as doth eternity." Here then are the problems. Our tools are method only. As we crave solutions, daydreaming what we might learn from Dickinson herself if we could visit the Stygian world and hold parley with her Shade, I am reminded of a story told me some years ago of William Lyon Phelps. "Will Rhett Butler return to Scarlett O'Hara?" a student queried after finishing Gone with the Wind . "That is an interesting question," he answered. "I am dining with Margaret Mitchell tonight, and I will try to bring you back the answer." "And what did she say?" the student asked next day: "What was Rhett's choice?" "She said," replied the professor, "that she hadn't the slightest idea."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Text of the "Envoy to Alison" by Harris Chewning</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "Envoy to Alison," a ballade of 27 lines, is extant in two fifteenth-century manuscripts and in seven of the black-letter editions of Chaucer's works. I shall attempt to work out the relationship among these nine texts, trying to limit the problem by studying the distributional and geneological evidence that is available. 1 The two manuscripts containing "Alison" are Fairfax 16 and Tanner 346, both in the Bodleian Library. The handwriting of both has been dated as being of the fifteenth century, and the date 1450 is written on the flyleaf of Fairfax 16 in an apparently contemporary hand. 2 In Fairfax 16 "Alison" is quite legible. In Tanner 346 a number of graphemes in "Alison" are badly faded or blurred; these were illegible in 1898, when the oldest extant transcription, that of Vollmer, was made. 3 Black-letter editions of Chaucer which contain "Alison" are Thynne's 1532 and 1542 editions, his undated edition, Stow's edition of 1561, and Speght's three editions—1598, 1602, and 1687. I shall refer hereafter to the nine texts of "Alison" by the following abbreviations: Fairfax 16: F Tanner 346: T Thynne 1532: Th1 Thynne, 1542: Th2 Thynne, no date: Th3 Stow: St Speght, 1598: Sp1 Speght, 1602: Sp2 Speght, 1687: Sp3 In studying the relation of these texts to each other I shall first consider the distributional evidence derived from a compilation of all variants. This compilation will make possible a statistical statement of the resemblances of the texts to one another. As an accessory to such statistics I shall where possible use the method of looking for runs of identical readings in pairs of texts; where two texts show such a run of considerable length, the likelihood of kinship is increased, for a number of consecutive agreements is much less likely to be due to mere chance than an equal number of non-consecutive ones. Distributional evidence may be expected at least to limit the number of possible trees. When it has been exhausted, I shall turn to geneological evidence, if it can be found, for further aid. In the texts of "Alison" the number of substantive variants ( i. e. , those involving meaning) is exceedingly small. It is therefore necessary to consider also minute differences in spelling and orthography. In order to assign proper value to variants of different degrees of minuteness, I arranged them according to the following classification. Beside each type I have indicated the number of variants of that type that occur. I. Substantive variants (7) A. Lexically different words (6) B. Add-omissions (1) II. Non-substantive variants (242) A. Non-significant variation in morphemes (3) (All of these involve actual difference in pronunciation, but without lexical difference.) B. Presence or absence of final — e (50) C. Significant difference in graphemes without morphemic difference (91) (These do not include words differing only in final — e. ) D. Difference in allographs of the same grapheme, viz., v:u, þ:th, lower-case letter: capital letter, and ff:F (43) E. Difference in suprasegmental phonemes, viz. , punctuation marks: slant, period, and comma. (55) In compiling the specimens of the several types I made no attempt to avoid overlapping. Therefore a word whose readings contain differences in final - e, in i and y, and in þ and th appears three times. Ordinarily, however, each word appears only once or twice. The illegible graphemes in Tanner were recorded as blanks. The occurrence of such a blank was not considered a variant in itself. The relation of the seven black-letter texts to each other was considered first. Within this group there are only three substantive variants. The first of these is in line 2, where Th3 and St read thus and other texts read thou . The minority reading makes little sense and could hardly have occurred without direct influence of one of the two dissenting texts on the other. Since St is the later, this variant is evidence that St was derived from Th3. The fact that the usual reading thou reappears in Sp1 is of no evidential value, for Speght not only might have used one of the texts earlier than St to correct the suspicious-looking thus but also had the verb haste calling for thou as subject. The second substantive variant is in line 6, where St and the three Speghts have abiyng (spelled abying in Sp2 and Sp3) and the three earlier texts have various spellings of obeying . 4 This seems to indicate that Sp1 is derived from St. The third substantive variant is brought in Sp1 against through in all other texts. This has no value whatever. All that can be extracted from these three variants, then, is their evidence that St is from Th3 and that Sp1 is from St. Turning to the non-substantive variants, we find that in Class IIA there are only three and that these indicate merely a gradual modernizing of spelling in successive editions. The non-substantive variants of the other four classes are numerous enough to give significant statistical results. With regard to all four of these classes, each of the Speght editions resembles its immediate chronological predecessor more than it resembles any previous edition. 5 The substantive variant obeying: abiyng, indicating derivation of Sp1 from St, does not contradict these findings. We may place the four latest texts, then, in straight-line derivational arrangement in order of date. When agreements among the three Thynne editions are examined, it is found that Th3 agrees with Th1 a total of 224 times (out of a possible 239) and with Th2 only 201 times. This indicates that Th2 and Th3 must have been derived independently from Th1. This relationship is indicated not only by the total for the four classes but also by the figures for each of the individual classes, except for IIE, which consists of differences in punctuation. However, if slants in Th1 are equated with commas in Th3, these two texts are found to agree perfectly; that is, they are punctuated in exactly the same places, whereas between Th2 and Th3 this correspondence is not quite perfect. A check on the statement that Th3 resembles Th1 more than it resembles Th2 was made by looking for long continuous passages in which two of these texts were identical. It was found that Th1 and Th3 are exactly alike for 71 consecutive words, including 29 variants (from haste, line 2, through O, line 12). Also there is a run of 43 consecutive words, including 12 variants, in these two texts from for, line 14, through is, line 19. When Th2 and Th3 were compared thus, however, no run longer than 17 words, including 3 variants, was found. The probability of a derivational relationship between two texts is enormously increased by the occurrence of such runs as occur in Th1 and Th3. The principle involved may be illustrated simply. If a given variant occurs in three forms throughout a set of texts, the chance that a certain two texts will agree thereon is one in three. If the next variant occurs in four forms, the chance that the two texts will agree on it is one in four. The chance that they will agree on both variants is one in three times four, or one in twelve. Thus, in a run, the chance of continuous agreement is one in a number equal to the product of the number of forms for each variant in the run. This product reaches astronomical size in a run of considerable length, and the presence of such a run is very strong evidence of derivational relationship between the two texts. Therefore the occurrence of the runs described removes all doubt that Th3 is more closely related to Th1 than to Th2. In the face of such evidence it is impossible for Th2 to be intermediary between Th1 and Th3. This instance demonstrates clearly the value of looking for runs as a method in distributional study. Where extensive runs are found, they add substantially to the evidence from statistics of number of agreements and may resolve cases undecided by such statistics. Looking for runs is most likely to prove valuable when the student is dealing with minute variants, which occur consecutively or close together, rather than substantive ones, which are usually fairly far apart. The frequency of minute variants of course makes it more likely that runs will occur and that significant ones may be detected in passages only a few lines in length. The question may be raised as to whether Th2 might have been derived from T or F rather than from Th1. But the table of agreements gives no support to such a conclusion; Th2 is more like Th1 than it is like any other text. We may, then, arrange the Thynne texts thus: 6 To complete the tree for the black-letters, we now need to know from what text Stow was derived. It will be recalled that the sharing of the reading thus in line 2 by St and Th3 was taken as evidence that St was derived from Th3. Let us see how this evidence compares with the testimony of the non-substantive variants. With which of the Thynne editions does St agree most often? On the three IIA variants the three Thynne texts agree perfectly, so that those variants are worthless. For IIB-IIE variants, agreements of Stow with the Thynne texts are as follows: Class Total Th1-St Th2-St Th3-St IIB 50 44 41 44 IIC 91 45 51 49 IID 43 40 40 42 IIE 55 47 49 51 ---- ---- ---- ---- 239 176 181 186 These figures show that St agrees most often with Th3; thus they corroborate the evidence of the thus: thou variant. When the method of looking for runs of consecutive identical words was applied to these four texts, no significant results emerged. Therefore, we may conclude that St is from Th3, 7 and the complete tree for the black-letter editions is as follows: The major problem in establishing the text of "Alison" is to determine the relationships among the three oldest versions of the poem — F, T, and Th1. Some important evidence emerges when the arrangement of the poem with regard to what precedes it and what follows it in each of the three texts is observed. In F it is preceded by "The Book of the Duchess," from which it is separated only by the line "Explicit the boke of the Duchesse," and at the end of "Alison" is no "Explicit," as the heading of the next poem, "Balade upon the Chaunse of the Dyse," follows immediately. In T "Alison" is immediately preceded by "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," with only the line "Explicit" separating the two poems. At the end of "Alison" is the line "Explicit þe Cuck. &amp; þe Nighting." in a hand different from the rest of the text, and the remainder of the page is left blank. On the next page begins "The Book of the Duchess" (Hammond, op. cit., p. 337). The Thynne text, like T, is preceded by "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale" with only "Explicit" between the poems. Following "Alison" is "Explicit" and the heading and beginning of the next poem, "Scogan unto the lordes . . ." It should also be noted that between the third stanza and the fourth is the heading "The lenvoye" in T and "¶ Lenuoye." in Th1, whereas in F there is no heading at this point. It appears that since both T and Th1 are preceded by the same poem and share the "Lenvoy" heading there must be some sort of kinship between them. The variant readings in the three texts must now be examined for distributional evidence. Within these texts there are only three substantive variants: Line F T Th1 1 foole foole foule 8 12 me ne ne 24 and of goodnesse and goodnes and goodnesse In these three variants, F and T agree against Th1 once, and T and Th1 agree against F twice. So the odds are two to one in favor of a closer relationship between T and Th1 than between either of them and F. This conclusion is consistent with the testimony of the order of material and the envoy headings, as mentioned above. Agreements among the three texts with regard to non-substantive variants are summarized in the following figures: 9 Class Total F &amp; T F &amp; Th1 T &amp; Th1 IIA 3 0 2 0 IIB 39 8 17 13 IIC 71 19 26 13 IID 40 7 27 4 IIE 28 5 2 20 ---- ---- ---- ---- 181 39 74 50 These figures agree with the other evidence in showing a divergence between F and T, but they contradict the evidence for kinship between T and Th1, for T and Th1 agree only 50 times, whereas F and Th1 agree 74 times. Further, this similarity between F and Th1 is attested by four out of five of the classes of small variants. However, the value of these statistics should be carefully weighed before they are allowed to counterbalance the evidence of the connection with "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," the envoy headings, and the substantive variants. The non-substantive variants on which F and Th1 agree can be explained as due to coincidence and do not necessarily indicate kinship between these two texts. There are 74 such agreements, constituting only 41 per cent of the total of 181 non-substantive variants in the three texts. Further, in the IID group, 19 of the 27 agreements of F and Th1 against T are due to the use of the thorn (þthe three texts. Further, in the IID group, 19 of the 27 agreements of F and Th1 against T are due to the use of the thorn (þ) in T; and three such agreements in IIC variants are due to the use of the yogh (ȝ) in T. But fifteenth-century printers did not use þ and ȝ, and Th1 would not have shown them even if its printer had been copying directly from T. These 22 agreements involving þ and ȝ are therefore valueless, and if they are disregarded there are only 52 agreements of F and Th1 in 159 variants, or 33 per cent. These remaining agreements might be of some value if they revealed the two texts sharing even a few unusual spellings. But the NED shows all the shared spellings to be commonplace ones, occurring frequently in the texts cited by the dictionary. That F and Th1 should coincide in about one out of three common spellings is no more than could be expected from chance. 10 In these three texts no help is to be had from runs of identical readings, as there are no such runs of appreciable length. It seems best, then, to reject the evidence of the small variants and, on the basis of the larger considerations, to call T and Th1 a subfamily apart from F. A tentative tree can be drawn thus: Can this tree be simplified by identifying either T or Th1 as x? To answer this we must return to the substantive variants. In these F and Th1 never agree, and T agrees with F once and with Th1 twice. Th1 has one unique reading (foule), F has two unique readings (me and of goodnesse), and T has no unique readings. Therefore only T can be placed as an intermediary. T, then, could be x in the above tree, but Th1 could not, for if Th1 were x, it would be difficult to explain the appearance of foole in F and T, since Th1 has foule . But no such difficulty arises from making T the ancestor of Th1, and simplicity is gained. The tree can therefore be changed to the following, which, however, is still tentative: We now have a two-forked tree and a state of affairs in which the text of O cannot satisfactorily be reconstructed. Obviously, for any reading on which F and T disagree, each text has equal authority with the other. It would be desirable, in order to resolve this conflict and achieve greater simplicity, to make either F or T the archetype if possible. In the light of the evidence of the substantive variants, the envoy headings, and the relation to "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," it is possible for either T or F to be archetype. This possibility is not disturbed by the fact that only T can be intermediary. These two trees are equally consistent with the distributional evidence: Further, since the tentative tree with x was based on the kinship of T and Th1 and the necessity that T be intermediary, a third alternative is also theoretically possible: Thus, with T as intermediary, any one of the three texts could be the archetype as far as the evidence so far shown is concerned. This is as far as distributional evidence can take us. Geneological evidence should next be sought, but in the texts of "Alison" such evidence is found to be so meager that it is of no value. If further evidence is to be produced, it must come from a comparative study of the entire Fairfax and Tanner manuscripts, not from examination of "Alison" alone. This study of the texts of "Alison" has not produced evidence sufficient to establish an authoritative text. However, it has partially solved the problem of the relationship among the nine versions, and these results may be stated: 1. The relationship of the black-letter texts may be established by means of distributional evidence. 2. T and Th1 are more closely related to each other than either is related to F; therefore the probable relation among the three texts is not simple radiation from an archetype. 3. Any tree not using a hypothetical manuscript must show T as intermediary. Of greater value than these specific results concerning "Alison" are the conclusions as to methods of textual study of manuscripts that have emerged. These are as follows: 1. When the texts being studied show so few substantive variants that it is necessary to attach great importance to non-substantive variants, it is useful to classify the variants according to minuteness so that appropriate evidential value may be assigned to them. The classification used in the present study is a workable one. 2. As an auxiliary to statistics of agreements, a consideration of runs of identical readings is valuable. Consecutive agreements are of more significance than scattered ones, and the presence of identical runs of considerable length is strong evidence of kinship between texts. The value of such runs was demonstrated in the case of the Thynne texts, where the derivation of the Th3 directly from Th1 was firmly established by the discovery of long runs linking these two texts. 3. The need for studying the entire texts of the Fairfax and Tanner manuscripts, in order to establish decisively the text of a short poem contained in those manuscripts, suggests an important principle for editors. The case of "Alison" demonstrates the paucity of variation that is frequently encountered in short texts, even when they exist in a considerable number of versions. When the piece under consideration is surrounded by material which may also be compared and studied, the evidence of this material should be used. Minor poems may not be edited safely in isolation from the larger units of text that contain them.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Wynkyn de Worde Editions of the Boke of St Albans and its Separates * by Eloise Pafort</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1496, when Wynkyn de Worde planned to reprint the editio princeps (1486) of the Boke of St. Albans, today often referred to as the Book of Hawking, Hunting and Heraldry, it was his intention to include some new material and to make certain physical improvements. The latter consisted in adding a title-page and a number of woodcuts 1 and in modernizing the phrasing and spelling. But on the whole, De Worde followed his model closely, even, one might say to a semblance of type, since he employed a rather heavy square letter obtained from Govaert van Ghemen (Godfried van Os), a printer of Gouda in South Holland, about 1491 when the latter removed to Copenhagen. 2 In later years, the initials and woodcuts reappeared frequently but the type, apparently considered unsuitable for English books, 3 was not used again by De Worde or by any other sixteenth-century English printer. Although De Worde launched his 1496 first edition in a small folio, he seems to have changed the format subsequently, for all later recorded texts of the Boke of St. Albans from his press were brought out in a handy quarto, a size increasingly favored by the establishment "At the Sign of the Sun." For the most part, the texts of these quartos inevitably contain some slight alterations in spelling but suffer chiefly from omissions of words and phrases in printing. Since De Worde was a popular printer, he must have reckoned the practicality of a pocket-sized edition soon after 1496, but there is a gap of approximately nineteen years before we can pick up the thread of De Worde's printing of the Boke of St. Albans . The earliest recorded quarto is preserved only as a fragment of three leaves and is Bodleian Rawl. 4° 598.8, catalogued as a separate printing of The boke of huntynge, the text of the fragment. Fortunately, one of the leaves has the signature E.i. and the catch-title "Huntynge," two workable clues for tracing this edition. As there are 33-34 lines to a page, we may start with the text on E1 and work backwards, in comparison with the 1496 edition, 4 to conjecture that this is a quarto edition of the whole work and that presumably "Huntynge" was the catch-title throughout as found in the Schwerdt quarto described later. From type criteria, the only basis offered, this Bodleian quarto might be dated circa 1515 5 an assignment determined by (1) fig. 6 of Isaac's 6 classification of De Worde's types; (2) a close examination of the type 7 of De Worde's dated publications 1513 to 1518, a range limited by Isaac's Fig. 6; and (3) by its closest resemblance to the type-pages of the Chronicles of England dated 1515. The 1515 edition must have gone well, for not long afterwards, some three years perhaps, another quarto appeared "At the Sign of the Sun." This, fortunately, is extant in a perfect though undated copy, the unicum formerly in the celebrated collection of sporting literature formed by C.F.G.R. Schwerdt 8 of Alresford, Hants. The extreme importance of the Schwerdt quarto is determined by the fact that we become acquainted for the first and only time, with a complete text of a De Worde quarto of the Boke of St. Albans; and since no other perfect De Worde quarto of this text is known to exist, its status is that of a bibliographical monument. The title of the Schwerdt reads: The boke of hawkynge | and huntynge | and fysshynge . This might well have been the wording of the Bodleian quarto, from which it could have been printed, unless there was a lost intermediate edition. The colophon adds a little more to its contents: "Here endeth the boke of hawkynge hūtynge and fysshynge | and with many other dyuer maters. Inprȳted in Flete strete at y e sygne of y e sonne | by Wȳkyn de Worde." The text is an abridgement, for the Schwerdt quarto indicates that when the change of format was under consideration, from a folio containing 74 leaves, to a quarto size, two extensive treatises on heraldry occupying some 33 leaves were dropped, presumably because they would have made the volume too bulky to be taken into the field by falconers, hunstmen, and anglers. In fact, the heraldic tracts, Liber armorum and The blasynge of armes with its numerous woodcuts of shields, never again made their appearance over De Worde's imprint or device 9 though the "importance of heraldry as a subject of polite study and speculation" was of absorbing interest in the fifteenth and even more so in the sixteenth centuries considering the remains dating from this early Tudor Age. Broadly, the Schwerdt quarto can be placed between the years 1518 and 1521; 10 the earlier date is more acceptable to Mr. F. S. Ferguson, for whose examination Mr. Schwerdt personally brought the little volume up to London: "As a result I am able to tell you that the book was printed [c. 1518-1521]. . . . Personally I incline to the earlier date, but I have no unalterable reason for doing so—it may have been printed as late as 1521, but I should think this must be the limit." 11 Since the volume is perfect it offers various typographical "points" for arriving at a year of publication: (1) the wording in the colophon: "In Flete strete at y e sygne of y e sonne," dates it after 1501, 12 for at the turn of the century De Worde moved to this new address; (2) the device beneath the colophon is McKerrow no. 25 13 who has determined its use from 1508 to 1531; (3) the state of the large title-cut 14 representing the falconer with his attendants demonstrates that the original block freshly cut for De Worde's folio in 1496 had been cut down to fit the quarto page; moreover, this block shows signs of cracking in two places, a condition never seen in the folio cut, but which might indicate its use in other lost quartos before the surmised date 1518, and finally (4) the letter-press is Isaac's 95 textura 15 as reproduced in his fig. 7 and is precisely the same as the types in publications dated 1517 and 1518. 16 The little Schwerdt volume concludes this review of the known De Worde quarto editions of the Boke of St. Albans . After the printer's death in 1534, to 1596 when this book of sport appeared for the last time in the sixteenth century, there were issued upwards of fourteen editions. 17 It is probable that two or three of these are, instead, issues for different stationers, each having his name attached to his quota of copies from the same edition. 18 They all bore the same wording in the title: "The boke of hawkynge huntynge and fysshynge with all the properties and medecynes that are necessary to be kept," or the same wording in the colophon: "The boke of Haukynge, Huntynge and Fysshynge, with other dyuers matters." And the progenitor of all these texts was, of course, the singularly popular De Worde quarto. Since the Boke of St. Albans contained practical information on the several pastimes extensively practised, De Worde saw the good sense of issuing each "manual of sport" in a size convenient for the pockets of each genus of sportsman. Whether this was done simultaneously with his issuing of the quartos of the whole work, there are no records to substantiate. But after 1518, the assigned date of the latest known quarto, two examples of "separates" whose texts originally appeared in De Worde's folio of the Boke of St. Albans, are known. In point of time, the first separate quarto is the unique 19 imperfect copy in the University Library, Cambridge, Sel.5.57 (formerly AB.5.37 8 ). Sayle 20 supplied the title Treatise of Hunting by Juliana Berners since it lacks the title-page and there is no colophon from which a title might be extracted. The versified text is the book of hunting followed by the miscellanea including the poem "A Faythfull frende wolde I fayne fynde", the same which occupies leaves c6 recto to e5 verso of the folio, but here (at this late date) either reprinted from an earlier lost quarto "separate" or a missing quarto edition of the folio later than the Schwerdt. On the verso of the title-page of the Cambridge quarto, the text must have begun with an introductory paragraph, and the beginning of the hunting treatise itself had the heading "Bestys of Venery." Sayle dates the Cambridge quarto [1530?]; accepted by STC under no. 3318. According to Isaac's classification it might be dated slightly earlier, circa 1526 to 1530 as determined by the letter-press: the sole use of s 3 with the curling serifs, which was the only s used after 1521; w 3 frequently employed in the middle and at the end of words as well as at the beginning, precisely in the manner seen in the type-pages of two dated books: The thre kynges of coleyne , 1526 (Morgan 20896) and The destruccyon of Jherusalem, 1528 (Morgan 21134), and the infrequent use of y 1 which became rare in 1530. The full title of De Worde's folio partially discloses the divers subjects treated: This present boke shewyth the manere of hawkynge &amp; huntynge: and also of diuysynge of Cote armours It shewyth also a good matere belongynge to horses: wyth other cōmendable treatyses. And ferdermore of the blasynge of armys: as here after it maye appere . 21 In this long intitulation, we find the treatises on Hawking, Hunting, and the two on Heraldry are named, but an extensive new addition is not mentioned, though it may be covered by the phrase "wyth other cōmendable treatyses". This unnamed tract, however, is itself conspicuously entitled: Here begynnyth the treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle and it is accompanied by a lively woodcut: Hodnett's English Woodcuts, 897. Oddly enough, this treatise is found between two heraldic essays at the end of the volume. But this "insertion" may have been unintentional, for originally De Worde had planned not to print the second heraldic treatise but later changed his mind. This treatise Here begynneth the blasynge of armes with its numerous colored woodcut coats of arms and its own set of signatures (a-c in 6's plus d in 8's), the printer may have intended to handle as a separate (see also footnote 9). The obvious appeal of the special subject matter to all classes would have made a profitable business venture to bring out in pocket-size editions. But the records, meager in the extreme, yield up only one separate printing of the Treatise on Fishing in a handy quarto size, which is to be dated as late as circa 1532 to 1534. This edition is today represented by the unique perfect copy in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Morgan 20894) and it occupies therefore a niched position among the separate printings from the De Worde folio of the Boke of St. Albans as the Schwerdt copy occupies among the quarto editions of the whole work. In a sense, the Morgan separate is of slightly greater magnitude, for it is the only proof, thus far, of De Worde's separate printing on fishing and the earliest known pocket manual on that subject in all the literature of sport in England. It is, then, as a new addition to De Worde's folio 1496 reprint of the Boke of St. Albans that the celebrated Treatise on Fishing with an Angle made its first appearance and became the earliest printed essay in English on the subject. The original text took up some 12 folios. De Worde, or his editor, must have thought the subject fully covered, for he described it as a "compendyous treatyse," whereas the author said "this symple treatyse" and wrote it for "al you that ben vertuous: gentyll: and free borne", the same public for whom the compilation was first conceived. The treatise is devoted to the art of "anglynge wyth a rodde: and a lyne and a hoke" as against all other manner of fishing. It is introduced by some general observations on the sport, but on the whole its character is technical, with seventeen woodcuts illustrating the making of fishing tackle. A comparison of these with the woodcuts in the 1496 folio discloses that the first, a representation of the fishing rod (B1 recto) is new in this separate edition; two instruments, the "Hamour" and "Knyfe" are missing from the original row of eight "for to make of your hookes" (B3 verso); a whole new set (four instead of five) of fishing-lines were cut to illustrate them (B4 verso); and the set of fish-hooks has been entirely omitted. The title of the Fishing quarto remained unchanged from its first printing: Here begynneth a treatyse of fysshynge with an Angle, reiterated in the colophon: "Here endeth the boke of Fysshynge | With other dyuers maters. Imprynted at London by Wynkyn de Worde | dwellynge in Flete strete at the sygne of the Sonne." Once more we find an undated colophon necessitating dependence upon typographical particulars: (1) the printer's address places the publication after 1501; (2) De Worde's mark beneath the colophon is the tripartite device (McKerrow no. 21) used from 1528 to 1534; (3) the letter-press discloses the frequent use of w 3 and the sole use of s 3 , which brings us up between 1522 and 1528; another letter y 1 which Isaac states was rare in 1530 does not appear at all; and finally the textura type used in the first line of the title is first found in 1532, Isaac's fig. 9. Resolving these minutiae, we may assign the date of the Morgan quarto to circa 1532 to 1534. The text of the Morgan separate quarto was the one that was reprinted with minor differences many years after De Worde's death. In modern times, however, it is the pure text as it was first published in 1496 that has been reprinted and facsimiled in extenso at various periods. De Worde's long title for the folio also exhibits another misleading promise: "It shewyth also a good matere belongynge to horses." Since the other treatises mentioned in the title are of considerable length, one is led to expect that a "good matere belongynge to horses" indicates a more extensive text on the horse than only the nine lines on folio e3, with the rubric "The proprytees of a good horse", listing simply fifteen essential conditions. It does not seem likely that De Worde would have singled out these nine lines from all the other just as fragmentary and miscellaneous pieces in the middle of the volume to be specified in his title had he not under consideration more comprehensive matter relating to horses. However, De Worde did not cast aside altogether the "good matere belongynge to horses," for that may well be the quarto bearing the title Here begynneth the Proprytees and medycynes for hors extant in the unique imperfect copy in the Huntington Library (no. 59359). 22 On folio A3 in that edition is a similar list of the fifteen points of a good horse which De Worde printed in his folio of 1496. The Huntington quarto may be dated circa 1504 to 1506. A specific test is found in the letter-press which is Isaac fig. 2, the 95 textura for 1501. 23 However, to Isaac's determinant letters in this textura must be added a small k with a large top loop brought in 1500 to the Sign of the Sun but not found in the Huntington quarto. This archaic k was used exclusively after 1500 in dated publications such as Alcock's Mons perfectionis, 27 May 1501; Thordynary of crysten men, 1502; and Le Fevre's Recuyles of Troye, 1503. After 1503, it drops out entirely. 24 By other typographical standards, 25 such as the type used in the chapter-headings and the state of the Crucifixion woodcut, De Worde's treatise on the horse has heretofore been wrongly dated from 1500 to 1502. The Huntington "separate" quarto contains the first twelve leaves out of an original sixteen and therefore lacks the end of the text including the colophon-leaf which contained a device. Ames 26 saw a perfect copy, for after quoting the above title he gives the colophon: "And here we shall leue to treate ferthermore in this sayd mater whyche is dylygently corrected and made after a sufficyent copy directed vnto me by a certen person whyche as hym thought rygt necessary to be knowen to gentlemen and men of honour as to seruysable and rustyck people." The wording of that colophon clearly places the Proprytees and medycynes for hors in the same category as the other treatises which make up the Boke of St. Albans . It remained for another Tudor printer, Robert Wyer, to prove what De Worde set out to do: knowledge of horses belonged in a book compiled primarily for gentlemen. In Here be Certayne Questyons of Kynge Bocthus of the maners | tokyns | and condycions of men | with the answeres made to the same by the Phylosopher Sydrac, 27 Wyer brings together with this dialogue wholly based on the Boke of St. Albans, "The Propertyes of a good Horse" which, to every appearance, has as its archetype the De Worde quarto at Huntington. Even as late as 1567, De Worde's tract was still in circulation in a text printed by William Copland with the title Mediciues (sic) for Horses, preserved in the unique imperfect copy at Trinity College, Cambridge. 28 The small-format volumes, the quarto size De Worde found so profitable in the fields of romances and schoolbooks, and suitably adapted for his treatises on the sports, proved for the bibliographer of today le modèle fatal . Because of its size, works of this type were easily lost, and copies are either extremely rare or, as seen in this review, the record is narrowed down to unique copies; the whole class of De Worde's "sporting literature for gentlemen" almost perished. One other branch of sport which might have appeared in a separate quarto by De Worde is the sport of flight—falconry, or the knowledge of and hunting with hawks, the first in the set of treatises in his folio. Assuredly compositions on this subject were in wide circulation in De Worde's own time. Some day perhaps a fragment will determine a quarto of his printing. 29 Fowling is a sport mentioned by the author of the Treatise on Fishing: "And therefore now woll I chose of foure good disportes &amp; honeste gamys | that is to wyte: of huntynge: hawkynge: fysshynge: &amp; foulynge." The last subject, thus ranked among the four major field sports of England, was unfortunately not included in the compilation of the schoolmaster printer of St. Albans or "inserted" by Wynkyn de Worde.

      <field name="heading_text">The Copy for the First Folio Richard II by Richard E. Hasker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The appearance of Shakespeare's Richard II in the first Folio in 1623 was preceded by five quarto editions, one in 1597, two in 1598, and one each in 1608 and 1615, the first deriving ultimately from the author's manuscript and each of the others being a reprint of its immediate predecessor. It has been generally accepted that an exemplum of the last of these, prepared and corrected, served as copy for the First Folio compositors, since the Folio and the 1615 quarto have in common a small number of readings which none of the other quartos share. When, however, in the early part of the present century Henrietta C. Bartlett first showed that there were two 1598 editions instead of one and that the apparently unique copy then owned by W. A. White of New York represented the later of the two, Alfred W. Pollard, on the basis of certain similarities between the text of the newly identified edition and that of the First Folio, queried whether this new quarto, possibly with some leaves supplied from the 1615 edition, might have been the copy used for the Folio. After weighing the evidence on both sides, Pollard concluded that the traditional answer was the correct one, although he left the matter in some doubt. 1 By a combined study of the agreements and differences in the substantives and accidentals in the First Folio and the two quartos in question I propose to show that Pollard's rejected supposition, that the copy for the Folio was an exemplum of Q3 containing some leaves from a copy of Q5, was indeed correct. Q1 was entered in the Stationers' Register by Andrew Wise on August 29, 1597, and was printed for him in the same year by Valentine Simmes. Since this represents a 'good' text, was regularly entered in the Register, and shows no signs of having been surreptitiously acquired, Wise must have purchased his printing rights from the Lord Chamberlain's Servants, to which company of actors Shakespeare belonged, and the quarto must be derived, either directly or through intermediate transcriptions, from the author's own manuscript. In 1598 Wise brought out a second edition (Q2), which is shown to be a reprint of Q1 by its repetition of most of the ostensible errors of the 1597 quarto, and which, by Pollard's calculation, introduced 123 new errors of a substantive nature. Q3, a line-for-line reprint of Q2 printed in the same year, was distinguished by Miss Bartlett as a separate edition rather than a variant state or reissue of Q2 by the discovery of dissimilarities on every page of the two quartos and by the fact that the type was entirely reset. That the two editions of 1598 are not independently derived from Q1 is evidenced by the fact that they share on the one hand most of the errors introduced by Q2 (Q3 corrected a few obvious Q2 errors) and on the other all of the corrections of Q1 substantive errors which Q2 had made. To show that Q3 is the later of the two 1598 editions, Pollard called attention first to two passages (b6 rb 32-36 and c2 va 60 ff.) 2 which were corrupted in Q2 and which Q3 tampered with in an effort to restore meaning to them, and secondly to another (c4 vb 51), bibliographically more important, in which Q1 reads for, Q2 reads for with the f so poorly printed that little remains of it, and Q3 reads or through the compositor's failure to recognize the existence of the broken letter in Q2. The Stationers' Register shows that on June 25, 1603, Andrew Wise "by consent of the Company . . . sett over" to Matthew Lawe his rights to Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV (Part I), and two religious or moral items. Lawe did not have Richard II printed until 1608, at which time he added the scene of Richard's forced abdication, the so-called "deposition scene," which had been censored from the play for political reasons before the printing of Q1 in 1597. The question of Lawe's copy for this new matter will be discussed later. The title-page of this 1608 quarto (Q4), which was printed for Lawe by William White, is found in two states, the original making no mention of the material now published for the first time, but the cancellans heralding these "new additions" and noting the change of name of the company of players from the Lord Chamberlain's Servants to the King's Majesty's Servants. The perpetuation in Q4 of errors originated by Q3 establishes Wise's last quarto as the printing source of Lawe's 1608 edition, and the same sort of evidence proves Lawe's 1615 quarto (Q5), perhaps printed by Thomas Purfoot, 3 to have been derived from Q4. 4 The claim of the First Folio editors that their plays were "Published according to the True Originall Copies" is interpreted by Sir Walter Greg to mean that playhouse manuscripts either were used as copy or were consulted to verify the readings of other editions from which the compositors were working. 5 The text of Richard II supports this theory. As it appears in the Folio, this play reprints errors and variant readings accumulated during the entire history of the quarto editions. Yet the Folio version introduces many new readings throughout and supplies a number of omissions in the "deposition scene," and despite the errors it retains from all five quartos and the new ones which it inevitably introduces itself, it corrects for the first time 24½ of the presumable errors 6 of Q1, 58 of Q2, 15 of Q3, 14 of Q4, and 33 of Q5 (Pollard, p. 51). These circumstances indicate that some source in addition to the quartos as we know them influenced the readings of the Folio text. Pollard (pp. 89ff.) suggested that this source was a copy of Q1 which had been used by the players as a prompt-copy and annotated accordingly. First of all, this would explain the restoration of Q1 readings which had been corrupted by the later quartos. In addition, exclusive Folio readings other than manifest errors could be considered notations and changes made in the prompt-copy in accordance with the players' practice, and the fifty lines omitted by the Folio, except the two instances of the omission of a single line, which are most likely the compositor's eye-skips, would thus probably represent cuts scored out in the annotated quarto. However, a prompt-copy in manuscript, derived ultimately from the same source as the copy for Q1, and thus having many of Q1's readings, would likewise explain these characteristics of the Folio, the chief difference being that the exclusive Folio readings then might be changes made in accordance with the actors' habits, as Pollard believed, differences introduced in the copying of the manuscript, compositors' variants, or original readings corrupted by Q1 or its copy. But Pollard felt that a manuscript prompt-copy would be abandoned for a printed quarto as soon as the latter was available, for, he thought, the printed copy would be easier to handle and to read. In either case, the retention in the Folio of so many errors from the quartos would indicate the imperfect care with which the additional source and the copy were compared. As evidence in support of the use of Q1 in this respect, Pollard noted the restoration in the Folio of Q1's archaic reading of brothers for brother in the phrase "my brothers Edwards sonne" (c3 ra 39), but this could have come from a manuscript text having the same source as Q1. Greg, arguing that a printed quarto would not ordinarily have been used in the theatre as a prompt-copy, finds it unlikely that "a prompter, accustomed to a manuscript 'book' with fifty to eighty lines on a page, would have found much convenience in a printed quarto of about half the size," 7 for the larger manuscript would put more of the play, including coming entrances, exits, and other stage business, before the eyes of the prompter at one time. However, there is now specific evidence that printed quartos were indeed used as prompt-books. C. J. Sisson has shown that many early plays were printed with the prospect of use as prompt-copies by their purchasers and that a provincial company in the reign of James I, whose repertory included King Lear and Pericles, customarily used printed quartos as prompt-books. He cites also an extant copy of A Looking Glass for London and England (1594) which has been annotated with manuscript notes and stage-directions for such a use by a London company on tour in the early seventeenth century. 8 Berta Sturman has found that the second quarto (1625) of A King and No King, already an old play by the time it was first published in 1619, was set up from a copy of the first quarto which had been used in the theatre as the official prompt-book by His Majesty's Servants. 9 Here then is an example of Shakespeare's own company using a printed quarto for its official book. Finally, Pollard many years ago pointed out evidence in the Folio stage-directions in Much Ado About Nothing and Midsummer-Night's Dream which suggests that the quartos used as copy for the Folio text of these plays had been employed in the theatre as prompt-books. 10 An important fact to be noted in connection with these examples of printed prompt-books is that none of them seems to have been in use until the play was old. Since most plays were not at this time printed before they were acted, the original prompt-book would have to be a manuscript. It does not seem likely that a company would abandon a satisfactory manuscript and go to the trouble of transferring its annotations to a printed copy as long as the manuscript was in good condition. Thus it is improbable that Q1 of Richard II, published when the play was still not very old, would have been taken over immediately as the prompt-book. It is perhaps safest, therefore, to assume that a manuscript, rather than a printed, prompt-copy was used in the comparison of official book with printed quarto which undoubtedly lies behind the Folio text of Richard II . Pollard believed that the collation was made at the instance of the Folio editors when copy was being prepared for their edition, but another hypothesis, to be proposed later, may displace this traditional theory. Pollard was certainly correct in his belief that the prompt-book which was collated with the printed quarto chosen as copy for the Folio was not available for use in Jaggard's printing-house, but that the quarto had been compared with it in the theatre. "We have first the fact that while some 120 of its readings 11 were restored, about 100 others were left in the state to which the subsequent Quartos had reduced them; and, secondly, we have a little handful of instances (I.i.77; II.ii.3; V.iii.63) where we find the Folio editor wrestling with the bad readings he found in Q5 and botching them as best he could, in a way which forbids us to suppose that he had a copy of the First Quarto 12 at his elbow all the time. I.i.77 reads in the First Quarto 'What I haue ſpoke, or thou canſt worfe deuiſe'. Q2 spoilt it by omitting 'worſe'; Q3 mended it by repeating 'what' before 'thou', and the Folio editor varied the botching by omitting this second 'what' and changing 'ſpoke' to 'ſpoken'. 13 In II.ii.3, where the First and Second Quartos have the phrase 'life-harming heauines' the Folio reads 'ſelfe-harming', and this seems to have originated in a gallant attempt to improve on the absurd 'halfe-harming' of the three later Quartos. So again, in V.iii.63, where the First and Second Quartos read 'held his current' and the Folio 'had his current', this very poor variant is clearly due to puzzlement caused by the three later Quartos spelling 'held' as 'hald'." 14 In the absence of the actual prompt-copy from which certain Folio readings must originally derive, one can estimate the extent of its use only by an examination of the readings of Q1 which the Folio either succeeded in restoring or failed to restore, because the manuscript can be presumed to have been closer to Q1 than to any of the reprints, though of course it cannot reasonably be held to resemble that quarto in every respect. The number of errors originating in each of the quartos and later cleaned up by the Folio has already been given above. 15 There then remains the accumulation of 100 or so of these uncorrected errors from quartos subsequent to Q1 to show that although the editorial work of the Folio was in many respects exceedingly good, it was not, however, performed without some degree of carelessness. Thus when the Folio reproduces a reading that first occurred in a quarto other than the First, then in a critical edition the reading of Q1 must be followed; but when the Folio has a reading which has not appeared before, an editor must determine from the evidence accompanying each individual case whether he is confronted with a compositor's or editor's corruption 16 or with some other type of variant. If the latter appears to be the case, he must then decide from the same evidence which reading is more likely to be authorial. 17 With the establishment of Q3 among the quarto reprints it was discovered that despite the Folio's retention of a considerable number of errors originated by the first three quartos, it does not reproduce most of those introduced by Q4 and Q5. Pollard showed that the Folio text has inherited 20 of the 69 presumable errors of Q1, 59 of the 123 errors of Q2, and 18 of the 35 in Q3, but only 1 of the 18 variants of Q4 and only 4 of the 38 of Q5. 18 Previous to the differentiation of Q3, this quarto's errors were necessarily believed to originate with Q4, and the Folio was therefore thought to embody a large number of errors from the 1608 edition as well as from the earlier ones, although the remarkable freedom from Q5 errors was recognized. Although he rejected the hypothesis (if somewhat uncertainly), Pollard felt that "the unusually complete success with which the First Folio succeeded in evading the new errors introduced by Q4 and Q5 would be very prettily explained if it could be shown that it was in fact set up from an edition in which these errors do not occur," namely Q3. He presented the case as follows: The chief evidence on which, before the discovery of [Q3], the Folio text was held to be based on [Q5] rather than [Q4] was the recurrence in the Folio of the misspelling 'formerly' for 'formally' in I.iii.29, and of the three variations 'ever' for 'never', 'wer't' for 'art', and 'thine' for 'thy' which come close together in V.v.70, 99, and 106. 'Formerly' for 'formally' is neatly balanced by the recurrence in the Folio of [Q3's] 'unpruind' for 'unprund' in III.iv.45 ('Her fruit trees all unpruind, her hedges ruind') after it had been corrected in [Q4] and [Q5], the one being a common misspelling, and the other possibly suggested twice over by 'ruind' at the end of the line. The three variants of [Q5] repeated in the Folio in V.v. come so suspiciously close together, that we may be reminded that the Fifth Quarto of Richard III is said to have been printed from copy made up from the [Third and] Fourth . . . and be tempted to suppose the Folio set up from a copy of [Q3] with the last two leaves supplied from [Q5]. But the Folio follows [Q5] in reproducing in I.iii.167 the curious misspelling 'percullist' for 'portcullist', which occurs in [Q4] but not in Mr. White's copy of [Q3], and though, with the variants in different copies of [Q1] before us, it cannot be denied that 'percullist' may have occurred in the copy of [Q3] followed by [Q4], though not in Mr. White's, an hypothesis which makes such large assumptions is worthless. Despite 'unpruind' and the suspiciously complete success with which the Folio eliminates the errors of [Q4] and [Q5], I am not prepared to challenge the derivation of the Folio from the Quarto of 1615, though the case on the other side is only a little less strong (Pollard, pp. 52-53). A collation of the substantive readings of Q3 and Q5 with those of the Folio, excluding for the moment all considerations of spelling as in unpruin'd and percullist, shows that of the 62 times that Q3 and Q5 disagree between themselves the Folio agrees with Q3 in 47 cases and with Q5 in 13. 19 On the remaining two of these occasions it agrees with neither. One of these cases is of no concern here because the Folio is not emending one quarto as opposed to the other; 20 but the second, although not a clearcut case, may suggest that the editor was working from a copy of Q3. The Folio reading (c3 ra 27) Landlord of England art thou, and not King: corrects the metrics of the line that appears in Qq 1-3 as Landlord of England art thou now not, not King, and in Q5 as Land-lord of England art thou now not, nor King. The Folio reading is here slightly closer to Q3 than to Q5 and thus occurs more easily as an emendation of the earlier quarto. The instances in which the Folio shares a reading with one of these quartos, but differs from the other, include agreements in the correction of obvious misprints 21 [F-Q3 it, Q5 is (d4 va 52); F-Q5 thy, Q3 they (c3 ra 20)], agreements in readings which are manifestly right from the context [F-Q3 my, Q5 thy (c4 vb 34); F-Q5 sits, Q3 sits not (d2 ra 52)], and agreements which seem to be neither more nor less correct than the variant of the other quarto [F-Q3 a word, Q5 one word (c2 ra 30); F-Q5 thine owne, Q3 thy owne (c1 ra 32)]. However, the significance of these figures—especially their overwhelming preponderance in favor of Q3 as the copy-text —is very badly shaken as positive evidence when it is found that in all but one of the Folio-Q3 agreements and in 5 of the 13 Folio-Q5 agreements, Q1 has the same reading as the Folio. These Q1 readings being the variants that the manuscript prompt-copy undoubtedly contained, they could as easily appear in the Folio by way of that document as by the use of one quarto instead of the other for the copy-text. Therefore, since they are not significant, an exhaustive list of them is not given here. Furthermore, half of the eight Folio-Q5 agreements which remain can be dismissed as having little more significance than the readings for which there is precedent in Q1. Com'st (c1 rb 50) is only a correction or modernization of comes ; night (c2 ra 37) corrects the obviously wrong nights , since it should rhyme with light in the preceding line; and the addition of the article in the phrase as a moate (c2 vb 25) regularizes the meter. Any editor (and most compositors) could be expected to make these changes without consulting a source. Finally, the phrase Let it be so, and loe occurs in the first three quartos immediately after the cut which removed the "deposition scene" and would seem to have been added to Q1 to achieve transition after the deletion. The censored text has: Bul . Let it be so, and loe on wednesday next, We solemnely proclaime our Coronation, Lords be ready all. The passage in the Folio reads: Bull . On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe Our Coronation: Lords, prepare your selues. (d2 vb 57-58) When the "deposition scene" was restored in Q4, the introductory phrase was struck out, presumably on the authority of the source from which the restored passage was acquired. The same origin applies also to the Folio readings set downe (for proclaime ) and prepare your selues (for be ready all ), which occur in the words immediately following. All of these Q5 readings one might expect to find in the Folio, whatever the quarto used as copy. Thus there remain in significant support of Q3 as the copy for the Folio Richard II the one substantive reading of the old-fashioned mine for my (d1 vb 65), which Pollard did not take into account, and the fact—negative evidence, it is true—that the Folio repeats 97 errors that had accumulated by the time Q3 was published, but only four variants that first occurred in the later quartos. To these may be added the emendation in c3 ra 27 which seems to be based on the Q3 reading. In contrast to this there are the Folio-Q5 agreements: formerly for formally (c1 rb 46), euer for neuer (d4 vb 44), wer't for art (d5 ra 9), and thine for thy (d5 ra 18). If, as Pollard suggests, formerly can be written off as a common error, it is found that the Folio-Q5 readings cluster together in the last three columns of the Folio edition in lines which in Q3 occupy the two final leaves, I3 and I4, and which in Q5 are found on the last three type-pages, K1 v -K2 v . This grouping suggested to Pollard the possibility (even though he rejected it) that the copy was Q3 with the last two leaves supplied from an exemplum of Q5. At this point the spelling variants can be considered. The form percullist near the beginning of the play (c1 vb 48), which the Folio has in common with Q5 and which is the only variant originating in Q4 to appear in the Folio, is not the obstacle that Pollard felt it to be, for the NED records it as a variant, especially in the noun form percullis , of the more usual portcullist . This is also true of the Folio-Q5 impresse for impreese (c5 rb 44). Conversely then, the Q3 spelling unpruind (d1 rb 57), occurring in the major section of the play in which there is the great lack of Q5 variants, is evidence (especially since it is the repetition by the Folio of a unique Q3 error) that the Folio compositors were here following Q3. It is not necessarily surprising to find the Folio avoiding other unusual Q3 spellings, for the orthography of that quarto is archaic in comparison with the consistently more modern First Folio. One other instance of spelling further suggests a made-up copy. In d4 vb 27, which precedes the first of the cluster of Q5 agreements by just seventeen lines and which falls within the lines which Q5 would have supplied if the two final leaves of Q3 had been missing, the Folio has the later quarto's abnormal tels, whereas Q3 has tells, the normal spelling in all three editions. The proximity of this variant to the group of Q5 substantives is very convincing. In general, however, other spelling variations do not occur in such a way as to indicate which quarto the compositors were using. If the copy for the Folio Richard II was indeed a mixed quarto, it is necessary to attempt to determine the point at which the compositor began to set up his text from Q5, though one cannot with absolute certainty fix the precise line which was the first to be taken from that quarto. If the last two leaves (I3 and I4) were missing from the copy of Q3, three leaves (K1-3) would have to be supplied from a copy of Q5, since the last line of I2 v in Q3 is line 9 on K1 v of Q5. Admittedly, it would be awkward for a compositor to pick up within the verso of a leaf; yet since there is no evidence that more than the last two leaves of Q3 were missing from the copy being used, it is more logical to believe that he would follow this quarto as far as it went and then pick up at the following line in the Q5 leaves, rather than that he would leave off in Q3, say after line 32 of I2, in order to begin at the top of the recto of the first leaf taken from Q5. It would have been even more awkward to leave Q3 at line 29 of I2 v in order to begin at the top of K1 v in the Q5 leaves. In the absence of more exact evidence it seems best, therefore, to assume that d4 va 56, which corresponds to the final line of I2 v in Q3, was the last Folio line to be set from Q3. Support for the evidence supplied by the substantives and spelling that the copy for Richard II was a made-up quarto comes primarily from the punctuation. Capitalization and italicization are of no help. The Folio makes extensive use of capitals and is fairly consistent in italicizing titles and proper names. On the other hand, Q5 makes considerable use of capitals and italics, though not so extensively as the Folio, whereas Q3 makes little use of either. The system in the Folio seems to be due to the compositors' habits and to bear no relation to either quarto, for not even in the Folio's lapses is there any indication of quarto influence. A comparison of the punctuation in the three editions is somewhat more helpful. It is, of course, true again that the Folio has its own heavy system, which is applied fairly consistently; that the punctuation of Q5 is somewhat lighter; and that the punctuation of Q3 is lighter still. There are, for example, 28 cases in which at the same point in the text a clause is ended in the Folio by a colon, in Q5 by a semicolon, and in Q3 by a comma. There are 14 in which the Folio has a period where Q5 has a colon and where Q3 has a comma, and 6 in which a Folio period is paralleled by a semicolon in Q5 and a comma in Q3. In addition, where the Folio makes extensive use of commas, the quartos (Q3 more so than Q5) use them more sparingly, sometimes omitting them in connection with vocatives and interjections. Finally, the countless times that all three editions are in agreement naturally supply no information. Any information regarding the copy to be derived from the punctuation must therefore be concerned with variations and lapses within the punctuation systems of the three editions and must revolve largely around the heavier punctuation marks. As a result, nothing can be learned from the instances in which the Folio and Q5 have heavy punctuation (not necessarily the same) and Q3 has a comma, or from the cases in which heavy punctuation in the Folio and Q3 (again not necessarily the same) is paralleled by a comma in Q5, for here the Folio might well be editing according to its own practice. 22 It can be assumed that the early prompt-book, although it supplied certain readings, had no influence whatever on the Folio punctuation. If the collation were, as Pollard thought, a part of the Folio editors' preparation of copy, the punctuation of the prompt would hardly have been incorporated into that copy since an entirely different system was to be used in the new edition; or if, as will be suggested later, the quarto was annotated some years earlier for use in the theatre, no attention would have been given to punctuation as long as it did not radically alter the sense, for theatrical manuscripts were very lightly punctuated. In punctuation the manuscript prompt-book may not, then, have been very different from Q1, which is also very lightly punctuated. In contrast to the grammatical punctuation in all the subsequent editions, Q1 in its set speeches makes use of dramatic punctuation, which led Pollard (p. 64) to believe that it represents Shakespeare's own system. The most significant fact a study of the punctuation yields is that on 48 occasions the Folio agrees with Q3 in using a comma where Q5 has a colon or semicolon and where the Folio would be expected to have heavy punctuation also. One of these cases is particularly meaningful because the punctuation determines the grammatical relationship of the words and hence the meaning of the line. Richard, realizing that all is lost, says in the Folio text: Goe to Flint Castle, there Ile pine away, A King, Woes slaue, shall Kingly Woe obey: That power I haue, discharge, and let'em goe To eare the Land, that hath some hope to grow, For I haue none. (c6 rb 22-26) In the third line of this passage the Folio and Q3 have a comma after haue , but Q5 has a semicolon, so that in the latter the words That power I haue form an independent clause referring to the preceding thought, whereas in Q3 and the Folio they are a dependent clause used as the object of discharge . Since compositor's convenience has already indicated that the matter for which the substantives suggest Q5 as copy-text begins at d4 va 57, it is to be noted that none of these Folio-Q3 agreements occurs after line 45 of the same column, although, it is true, there are also five earlier pages (c1 v , c4 v , c5 v , c6 v , and d3 r ) 23 on which none of these particular agreements is found. Individual examples are untrustworthy because of the possibility of coincidence, but the occurrence of two of these agreements in this column (d4 va 3 and 45, which correspond respectively to I2:33 and I2 v :27 in Q3) indicates further that Q3 was the copy through d4 va 56. (It is true that in line 47 the Folio agrees with Q5 in using a semicolon where Q3 has a colon, which somewhat weakens the evidence of the two commas, but information derived from a choice among heavy punctuation marks is perhaps less conclusive than that from Folio commas standing in contrast to heavier punctuation in a given quarto. The evidence for the last line to be set up from Q3 is at best only suggestive.) On the other hand, before d4 va 57 there are only two instances in which the Folio shares a comma with Q5 as opposed to heavier punctuation (a colon in one case and a period in the other) in Q3. The first of these occurs on b6 v , which has eleven of the Folio-Q3 agreements; the other, on c1, which has three of the Folio-Q3 agreements. In such a situation these two isolated cases are surely fortuitous. Although it is true that in view of the relationship of the punctuation in these three editions chance would make lapses in the Folio system agree more frequently with the much lighter punctuation of Q3, the totals and proportions in this instance cannot possibly be due to coincidence. Within these same pages the occasions on which the Folio and one quarto agree in the use of a colon or semicolon against the other punctuation mark in the differing quarto are nearly balanced, but if added to the figures already given, they certainly do nothing to destroy their evidence. The Folio and Q3 twice have colons and twice have semicolons in common where Q5 has the other of the two marks, and the Folio and Q5 twice have colons and once have semicolons where Q3 disagrees by using the other mark. This makes a total of 52 Folio-Q3 agreements in comparison with 5 Folio-Q5 agreements in this major section of the play. As has been stated, the occurrence of commas in relation to other commas or to a lack of punctuation is generally unreliable for information regarding the copy. Nevertheless, there is a handful of instances in which the Folio fails to use a comma where it would normally be expected to have one and in so doing agrees with the punctuation of one of the quartos against the other. Three times the Folio is in agreement with Q3. The first of these, by far the most significant, occurs in b6 va 16, which begins the passage Which blood, like sacrificing Abels cries, (Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth) To me for iustice, and rough chasticement: A comma after Abels, which appears in Q5, immediately makes it clear that cries is a verb rather than a noun, but both the Folio and Q3 omit it. For what they are worth two other lines may be given: Ser . What are they dead? (d1 va 1) Yor . I will be satisfied: let me see it I say. (d3 vb 3) The Folio and Q3 have no comma after the interjection what in the first of these or before the parenthetical I say in the second, whereas in both cases Q5 does have a comma. The only similar Folio-Q5 agreement is the omission of a clarifying comma before holliday in c5 rb 63: A while to worke, and after holliday. Here Q3 has the punctuation. This omission, however, is not nearly so serious as the one in connection with Abels, and that particular Folio-Q3 agreement remains by far the more significant. All instances involving parentheses or hyphens occur well within the section set up from Q3. By themselves the parentheses show little, but in conjunction with the other punctuation they throw their weight in support of this quarto as the copy. It is, of course, true that there are many cases where the Folio uses parentheses though neither quarto does, and a few in which the Folio has other punctuation even though both quartos have parentheses. Nevertheless, on the five occasions when the two quartos disagree in the use of these marks, the Folio always agrees with Q3 in omitting them. The evidence of the hyphens is less conclusive, but argues for Q3 when added to other facts. Again, as in the case of all punctuation, the Folio uses hyphens more frequently than either quarto, and very occasionally it will omit them where both quartos have them. Where Q3 and Q5 are not in agreement, the Folio agrees with the latter seven times in having hyphens, which is what would be expected since it is in keeping with Folio practice. However, on seven other occasions the Folio agrees with Q3 in omitting them, although there too it might have been expected to use them in accordance with its general tendency. 24 One group of contradictory evidence must be accounted for. On fifteen occasions, elsewhere than at the end of a speech, Q3 and Q5 disagree in the use of a period as opposed to some other punctuation mark and the Folio agrees with one of them—in nine of these cases with Q5; in only six, with Q3. This group needs to be considered by itself rather than to be included in other Folio-quarto agreements in heavy punctuation because it is a relatively infrequent type of punctuation. In the light of the evidence of the other punctuation, however, this one-fifth majority in favor of Q5 is undoubtedly due to the fact that the more frequent use of heavy punctuation in Q5 than in Q3 would make the still more heavily punctuated Folio more likely to agree with the later quarto in all cases where chance could be operating. The Folio punctuation of c6 ra 15 is similar: Againe uncurse their Soules; their peace is made With Heads, and not with Hands: those whom you curse Haue felt the worst of Deaths destroying hand, (c6 ra 15-17) Q3 has: Againe uncurse their soules, their peace is made. With head, and not with hands, those whom you curse Haue felt the worst of deaths destroying wound, Q5 reads: Againe uncurse their soules, their peace is made With head, and not with hands, those whom you curse Haue felt the worst of deaths destroying wound, The difficulty lies in the Folio's failure to repeat the period after made if Q3 was indeed the copy. The Folio Heads for the quarto head must be a correction from the prompt-copy, for Q1 here agrees with the Folio. 25 Therefore, if the postulated manuscript prompt-book can be assumed to have had more or less the same punctuation as Q1, it is possible that this is an exceptional case of the influence of the prompt on the punctuation of the Folio copy. Q1 has only commas, but they give the same grammatical relationship as the stops found in the Folio: Againe, uncurse their soules, their peace is made With heads and not with hands, those whom you curse Haue felt the worst of deathes destroying wound, When in the collation of the prompt-book and Q3 the word head was made plural, the reader, noticing that the punctuation of the quarto disagreed with the sense of the prompt, could have struck out the period after made . It is perhaps significant that each compositor after Q3 tinkered with the punctuation at this point. Q4 has a comma, and Q5, as already shown, nothing. Finally, in the passage (c4 va 64-66) Bull . Euermore thankes, th'Exchequer of the poore, Which till my infant-fortune comes to yeeres, Stands for my Bountie: the Folio agrees in line 64 with Q5 in the form thankes followed by a comma, where Q3 follows the earlier quartos with thanke's without a comma. As a correction or modernization, the Folio reading does not necessarily require precedent, and the comma is, of course, in keeping with normal Folio practice. The evidence of the punctuation must be considered collectively, for individual cases, except those commented upon, are too subject to chance to mean much until they are seen in the aggregate. Taken as a whole, then, the punctuation of the Folio edition of Richard II shows in all but approximately the last three columns of the text the influence of Q3. That this major portion of the play was set from Q3 has already been indicated by the repetition in the Folio of the Q3 error unpruin'd and the Q3 reading mine and by the lack of unexplainable agreements with Q4 or Q5. Added to this, the evidence of the punctuation makes it certain that up to approximately d4 va 57 Q3 was the copy for the Folio. Similar evidence shows that from approximately d4 va 57 to the end of the play the lines were set up from the last three leaves of Q5, from which fact it must be assumed that the two final leaves of Q3 were missing or mutilated beyond use. The major evidence here is the three Q5 substantives which come so close together: euer (d4 vb 44), wer't (d5 ra 9), and thine (d5 ra 18). These are reinforced by the repetition in d4 vb 27 of Q5's abnormal spelling tels . The punctuation variants in this section are uninformative. The two Folio-Q3 agreements in the use of a colon (d4 vb 35 and d5 rb 15), where Q5 has a period in one case and a semicolon in the other, are outweighed by the other evidence, although there is no similar Folio-Q5 agreement to balance them. It is quite true that this latter section of the Folio play contains four substantive readings in agreement with Q3, from which Q5 differs. However, not only are they all corrections which a careful editor might make: eare for care (d4 vb 17), their for there (d4 vb 24), haue for hath (d4 vb 34), and Towne of Ciceter for towne Ciceter (d5 ra 41); but more important still, they are also readings which are found in Q1 and thus most likely were in the manuscript prompt-copy. Thus for the last three columns, probably beginning actually at d4 va 57, Q5 must have been the copy, and Pollard's suggestion that the Folio Richard II might have been set from a made-up copy proves to be true. There remains to be briefly considered the "deposition scene," which begins in the Folio at d2 rb 18 and ends on d2 vb 56 and which comprises almost one-third of the single scene of Act Four. Political conditions at the end of the sixteenth century had made any suggestion of the dethroning of a monarch dangerous. Most literary historians believe that the passage was excised for this reason, though Richard technically abdicates and the lines actually enlist sympathy on his side. Pollard, who thought that the play gained dramatically from the omission, felt that artistic considerations also influenced the excision (p. 63). When Matthew Lawe acquired the rights to the play and brought out Q4 in 1608, he restored the long passage (calling it "new additions"), presumably because it was by then being acted in the play and he wanted his edition to be up to date. P. A. Daniel's suggestion (p. xi) that Andrew Wise had acquired these lines along with the rest of the play, had kept them in manuscript, and then handed them over to Lawe when the latter bought the play is highly speculative. It is unlikely that Wise would have kept such material if indeed he had ever had it. Moreover, the condition of the passage in Q4 and Q5 indicates a memorial reconstruction, for the quarto text has a considerable amount of incorrect line-division and omits six half-lines and one complete line. The Folio corrects the lineation and supplies the omissions. There are also a number of variant readings in the texts of this scene, some of which occur in connection with the omissions in the quarto version. It is safe to assume that the quarto readings in these cases are also due to the memorial reconstruction of the text and that the Folio variants were supplied by the copy, but there is no direct bibliographical evidence to show whether the Folio text of this passage was set up from a manuscript or from corrected pages of Q5. Since the "deposition scene" occurs in the section of the play set from Q3, which lacks this passage, leaves could have been taken from the copy of Q5 which supplied the last leaves of the made-up copy-text, or a transcript of the lines could have been made when Q3 was compared with the manuscript prompt-book. The Folio and Q5 compositors each maintain their own policies regarding the accidentals, and the scene fails to shed the light on the rest of the play that one would hope for. One might expect that a few lines immediately before and after the material missing from Q3 would have been set from the same source as this material if the copy had been Q5 leaves and would have left traces of the nature of their copy. Not only is such evidence lacking, but in d2 vb 60, only two lines beyond the last line supplied in connection with the "deposition scene," there is one of the Folio-Q3 agreements in the use of a comma as against a Q5 semi-colon. The absence of the evidence desired may be due to the convenience with which the extra material could be inserted into Q3. The deletion occurs within three lines of the bottom of H1 r of Q3, and those three lines, being the ones that had been rewritten to cover the omission, had to be supplied anew with the rest of the "deposition scene." Hence the compositor could set from the quarto to what was thus in effect the bottom of H1 r , then make the necessary additions, and finally take up again in Q3 at the top of H1 v , exactly where he had left off. It becomes necessary to explain why the copy for the First Folio Richard II should have been a made-up quarto, for it is fantastic to think that Jaggard was able to get hold only of two fragmentary quartos and had to piece them together. A mutilated quarto would have to be of some importance for anyone to bother to fill it out with leaves from another exemplum or for a printer to use it for copy when he presumably would have little trouble in finding another that was complete. Professor Fredson Bowers has recently suggested to me that if the copy of Q3 used by the Folio compositors were itself the official prompt-book of the King's Company, it would fulfill this condition. Q5 leaves might be used to restore a lacuna either by a book-keeper who did not want to go to the trouble to annotate a whole new quarto (or transcribe extra leaves) or by an editor who wanted to uphold his claim that he was publishing "according to the True Originall Copies." This hypothesis also has the advantage of offering a much simpler history of the omission of certain lines from the Folio text: because these passages were scored out of the prompt-book which the compositor was using, he likewise left them out of the Folio as a result of a too scrupulous following of copy. According to Pollard's alternate theory, one would be faced with the less desirable circumstance that the editor, confronted with both a complete text and an abridged one, had chosen to follow the latter. The use of Q1 as a prompt-book as early as 1597 has previously been rejected on the grounds that it seems unlikely that the prompter would have abandoned a good manuscript prompt-copy just because a printed quarto had appeared. Nevertheless, the manuscript would in time become too worn for use, and it would then be cheaper and easier to replace it by annotating a printed text already in existence than to have a new transcript made by a scribe. If this can be assumed to have happened in the case of Q3, then the collation of that quarto and the early prompt-book was made not, as Pollard believed, at the time of the preparation of copy for the Folio, but presumably some years before, and is thus one step removed in time from the editing of the Folio. It has already been suggested that the incompleteness and unevenness of the collation indicate that Jaggard did not have the early prompt-copy in his shop. As according to the new hypothesis no first-hand use of the original prompt-book would seem to have been made in the Folio, that early document may have been lost or destroyed after it was succeeded by an annotated copy of Q3. Q3 would probably have been chosen for the prompt-copy because it was the most readily available edition when a new book was needed. One can speculate that the need arose before the publication of Q4 in 1608, for a copy of Q3 used as a prompt-book would involve the rather awkward circumstance of having to preserve or copy the "deposition scene" in manuscript and insert it in the presumably smaller quarto for performances in which these lines were restored. If Q4 or Q5 had been published by the time a new prompt was needed, one or the other would have been a far more convenient quarto to use by virtue of its already having the previously omitted material, although the state of this section of the text would have necessitated extensive and possibly cramped annotation. Therefore the theory that the made-up copy was a theatrical prompt-book may carry the further implication that the "deposition scene" as it appears in the Folio was set up from a manuscript rather than from annotated leaves of Q5. In speculating on the relationship of the time of the accident which mutilated the Q3 prompt-book to the time of the printing of the Folio, one is faced with several possibilities. The accident could have occurred in the theatre, or it might have happened after the quarto was brought to the printing-house. Although one would ordinarily expect the damage to be repaired as soon as it was done, it would even be possible, however, that the leaves were lost in the theatre, but through carelessness or the removal of the play from the active repertory were not replaced until the quarto became printer's copy. A stage-direction in the Folio may suggest a solution to this problem. In the margin at d4 vb 10 the Folio has for its stage-direction the one word Musick , whereas the corresponding direction in Q5 reads Musicksplaies . 26 and occurs three lines farther along in the speech, at the point at which Richard first mentions that he hears music in the distance. Considerations of space do not seem to have dictated the change of position or of form. In the first place, because of the amount of text still to be set up, the compositor could have been entertaining no thought of finishing the play on this type-page. Furthermore, although other stage-directions in this part of the play have been shortened or reworded, the purpose does not in any instance seem to have been to save space. All of those that consist of more than one word are put into the column as separate lines rather than relegated to the margin, and one or two directions have been expanded beyond the quarto readings. Even if the compositor had abbreviated this particular stage-direction in order to put it into the margin, there is no reason for his having moved it to the line beside which it stands in the Folio. Not only is this line slightly longer than the one next to which the direction originally occurred in the quartos, but between the two there is a line much shorter than either of them, which would have been a much more likely choice if the compositor had thought that he did not have room for the stage-direction in its original place. Both the brevity and the anticipatory position of the Folio stage-direction suggest as copy a prompt-book annotated in such a way that the prompter would be warned ahead of time that his sound effects must be ready. In the light of this example, the change of the Q5 direction Enter one to Richard with meat . to the Folio reading, Enter Keeper with a Dish. (d5 ra 3), may also indicate a prompt-book. It may follow, therefore, that the other Folio variants of Q5 stage-directions are likewise due to the nature of the copy, although all the rest, including the removal of Enter Keeper with a Dish. and of Enter Northumberland . (d5 ra 43) from their incorrect positions in Q5 to correct ones in the Folio, are well within the powers of an editor's independent emendation. If this speculation is correct, then the Q5 leaves were supplied when the exemplum of Q3 was being used in the theatre as a prompt, and the accident antedates the use of the quarto as printer's copy. The theatrical use of this made-up prompt-book further implies that Richard II was still being acted as late as 1615, the date of the publication of Q5.</field>

Instead of an emendation, this could as well be a correction originating with the manuscript prompt-copy which, it will be argued below, contributed readings to the Folio. 7 Editorial Problem, p. 15, n. 1. 8 "Shakespeare Quartos as Prompt-Copies," RES, XVIII (1942), 129-143. 9 "The Second Quarto of A King and No King, 1625," Studies in Bibliography, IV (1951), 166-170. 10 Alfred W. Pollard, Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909), pp. 126-127. All other citations of Pollard refer to his facsimile edition of Q3. 11 That is, the readings of Q1, which a manuscript prompt-book can be assumed to have shared. 12 Or, by the alternate theory, the manuscript prompt-book. 13 Since there can be no reason why the Folio editor should tamper with a line which, considered alone as it stands in Q3 and Q5, presents no problem, this instance would seem to be deference on his part to an imperfect collation in his copy rather than an example of spontaneous botching. Apparently when his quarto was collated in the theatre with the early prompt-book, the word what had been struck out of the printed text without the addition of the necessary worse . As a result, he must have changed spoke to spoken in an attempt to perfect the halting meter at the same time that he was following his "corrected" copy. Such an emendation could be made as well by the compositor as by the editor, however. 14 Pollard, p. 89. In the third example the reading had could easily be a compositor's variant for hald which would be overlooked if proof were read in the printing-house without reference to copy. 15 They are listed in toto in the several tables in Pollard's essay. 16 A matter obviously due to editorial policy is the substitution in the Folio of Heaven where the quartos have God . King James objected to the use of the word God on the stage. 17 This is an application of the principles of W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 19-36. From the discussion below it appears that in the "deposition scene" an editor would always follow the Folio readings except, of course, in cases of obvious error. 18 Of the corruptions which the Folio eliminates, two originated by Q4 and one by Q5 may be discounted, because they occur in lines which it omits, but this in no way affects the proportions indicated here. Pollard, pp. 49-51. 19 Included as a Folio-Q5 agreement is the reading com'st (Q3 comes, Q5 comest ) in cl rb 50. The elision of syllables without quarto precedent is a frequent Folio practice. 20 Q3 misassigns Northumberland's lines to Willoughby, who has just spoken, and repeats the Willoughby speech-heading. Q5, following Q4's attempt at emendation, gives the last line of the first Willoughby speech to Northumberland. The Folio (c3 va 43-46) restores the reading of Q1 by leaving the first Willoughby speech intact and correctly assigning the other to Northumberland. 21 This includes all misprints which result in an English word, however obvious they may be, but excludes such readings as Folio-Q3 oppression, Q5 opptession (d1 rb 43), where the typographical error results in nonsense. In either case the Folio always agrees with the correct reading, which leaves such variants without significance anyway. 22 In this study none of the figures reporting the occurrence of punctuation marks include instances in which the dissenting quarto is incorrect by Elizabethan standards. The Folio could in such a case agree with the other quarto fortuitously by attempting to correct its copy. Moreover, the last statement made above does not include the somewhat more important cases in which the Folio agrees with either Q3 or Q5 in the use of a period within a speech. This group is treated below separately. 23 This interesting alternation of type-pages bears no relation to the alternation of the two Folio compositors. The first of them was among those set by the man traditionally called Compositor B; the others are the work of Compositor A. Cf. Edwin Eliot Willoughby, The Printing of the First Folio (1932), p. 56. Folio-Q3 agreements in other kinds of punctuation discussed below are found on c1 v , c5 v , c6 v , and d3 r . 24 Folio elisions are of no value in determining the quarto used as copy, for their evidence is evenly divided. In many cases— though by no means in all—the Folio for metrical purposes elides a weak syllable, oftenest the ending of past participles, whether the quartos do or not. On eight occasions, all occurring before the lines for which Q5 was the copy, the two quartos disagree with each other in eliding syllables. Half of these are without significance because the Folio agrees (twice each) with the quarto which has the more regularly metrical reading. In the other four instances the Folio follows the reading which fails to elide and produces a hypermetrical line, but as this agreement is twice with one quarto and twice with the other, it gives no information as to the copy. 25 The Folio hand, where all the quartos have wound, is obviously due to the compositor's memorial confusion with the Hands of the preceding line. Wound rhymes with ground in the next line. 26 This is obviously a misprint for Musicke plaies. , for Musicke is the spelling found both in Q4, which was the copy for Q5, and in another occurrence of the word in the same line in Q5. The corresponding stage-direction in Q1-3 reads, with variant accidentals, the musicke plaies . The Q4 compositor probably dropped the article so that the stage-direction would not run over to the next line, and the Q5 compositor may have run the words together in order to be able to separate the direction from the text with a sufficient amount of space to prevent the confusion of one with the other. Apparently for the same reason he omitted punctuation and ran words together within the line of text, although the improper spacing in Q4 may also have had some influence on him here.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Compositor Determination in the First Folio King Lear by I. B. Cauthen, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The methods of determining the compositors of the Shakespeare First Folio (1623) by spelling tests have become well-known to bibliographers. The first suggestion for such a determination was advanced in 1920 by Thomas Satchell, who noted that orthographically the Folio Macbeth fell in two distinct divisions, (1) from the beginning of the play to III.iii (216-col. a, 2m5), and (2) from III.iv to the end of the play (col. b, 2m5-2n4). 1 With the exception of one page (2m2), the first portion of the play contains the forms doe and goe , whereas the latter portion uses the forms do (or doo ) and go . Mr. Satchell supports this division of the play by a list of thirty-three other words which are consistent in each half of the play, but differ in the two halves. 2 He was unable to determine whether these findings were best explained by supposing that two compositors worked on the play or that two copyists worked on the manuscript from which the play was printed. It remained for E. E. Willoughby in The Printing of the First Folio (1932) p. 56ff. to demonstrate from the printing of other plays in the Folio that Mr. Satchell's conjecture that two compositors were used was correct. Using the doe/do and goe/go forms as a basis, he selected three other "especially significant words not peculiar to Macbeth ": cousin/cosin (or cosine, cozen ), here/heere , and traytor/traitor . Using these five words, Mr. Willoughby confirmed Mr. Satchell's division of the play: one compositor, whom he labelled "A," set from the beginning of the play through 2m1 v ; the second compositor, "B," set one page (2m2), but immediately following this page the typesetting was resumed by A, who set from 2m2 v through column a, 2m5; compositor B returned to the setting and continued from column b, 2m5, through the end of the play. With the same test, Mr. Willoughby identified two compositors at work in Richard II, Julius Caesar, and Hamlet . He further showed that the two compositors were at work in The Tempest, the first play to be printed, and that compositor A set up the present first page of Troilus and Cressida, the last play to be printed. But he introduced the possibility that another compositor or another pair of compositors participated in setting type within the Folio, particularly in A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, and Romeo and Juliet which "show no evidence . . . of having been composed by either A or B" (p. 58). When we apply Mr. Willoughby's test to King Lear in the Folio, it could appear at first sight that the unknown compositors were at work, as the following distribution of variants shows: 2q2 2q2 v 2q3 2q3 v 2q4 2q4 v 2q5 2q5 v 2q6 2q6 v 2r1 2r1 v 2r2 doe 1 1 1 1 goe 1 2 4 1 here 2 3 1 4 2 2 2 traytor do 1 3 3 4 5 4 3 2 3 4 4 6 go 1 2 2 3 1 1 3 heere 2 2 1 2 3 3 1 traitor 2r2 v 2r3 2r3 v 2r4 2r4 v 2r5 2r5 v 2r6 2r6 v 2s1 2s1 v 2s2 2s2 v 2s3 doe 1 1 goe 3 1 1 here 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 traytor do 4 2 1 3 4 3 9 6 2 10 1 6 5 2 go 2 3 5 3 1 1 3 1 3 2 3 1 1 1 heere 3 2 2 2 1 1 3 2 2 5 3 1 1 traitor 2 5 1 1 2 3 1 1 Here it appears that compositor B was responsible for pages 2q2, 2q3 v , 2q4, 2q5, 2r1, 2r2, 2r2 v , 2r3 v , 2r4, 2r4 v , 2r5 v , 2r6, 2r6 v , 2s1, 2s1 v , 2s2, 2s2 v , and 2s3, where the proportion is four or more characteristic B-forms to one characteristic A-form. But in the remaining nine pages (2q2 v , 2q3, 2q4 v , 2q5 v , 2q6, 2q6 v , 2r1 v , 2r3, and 2r5) we have a higher proportion of A-forms, and in two instances (2q3 and 2q6) they outnumber the B-forms. Thus we should assign these pages either to the unknown compositor(s) or to compositor A. Yet in these pages appear words other than do, go and here which are spelled in compositor B's characteristic way; for example, on 2q2 v , a doubtful page, we have maiesty, B's characteristic spelling, three times. And on 2q3, where the A-forms outnumber the B-forms, we have the characteristic B spelling deerest . In the light of this, Mr. Willoughby's admittedly "simple" test can be trusted only where preponderant evidence reveals the compositor. In instances where the evidence is doubtful, other tests must be used to determine the responsible compositor. Another test for the determination of compositors is that evolved by Charlton Hinman, who published an account of his technique in 1940. 3 Briefly, the test gathers evidence from significant variant spellings and, by an appeal to "coincidence of position," determines the compositor who is at work. But an examination of 600 variant spellings of 142 words in the Folio text of Lear failed to bring to light any demonstrable two-compositor pattern. Indeed, from all the evidence derived from this test it appeared most likely that only one compositor was at work during the setting of the play. 4 Because characteristic forms do not appear "on distinct groups of pages" we are justified in evaluating this evidence as indicating only one compositor. If only one compositor is responsible for Lear, the next question concerns his identity. Since the last part of the play can be shown by Mr. Willoughby's test most probably to have been set by compositor B, it follows that the whole play was set by him. However, this simple test needs confirmation. Fortunately, several additional pieces of evidence can be advanced to identify the compositor of Lear with the compositor B of the rest of the Folio. Although individually these details are not irrefutable in themselves, the cumulative weight of them all shows conclusively that this compositor is B. This evidence can be drawn from two sources, the plays surrounding Lear and from Lear itself. First, evidence from the simple compositor-determination test shows clearly that the plays surrounding Lear were set by identifiable compositors. The following table shows the compositorial assignments in these neighboring plays: Timon (2g3 v -2h5 v ) Compositor B: 2g3 v -2h5 v 21 pages Julius Caesar (2k1-2l5 v ) B: 2k1-2k2 3 A: 2k2 v -2k3 v 3 B: 2k4-2l5 v 16 Macbeth (2l6-2n4) A: 2l6-2m1 v 4 B: 2m2 1 A: 2m2 v -col. a, 2m5 5½ B: col. b, 2m5-2n4 10½ Hamlet (2n4-2q1 v ) B: 2n4 v -2n5 v 3 A: 2n6-202 5 B: 202 v -203 2 A: 203 v 1 B: 204-2p4 13 A: 2p4 v -col. a, 2p6 v 4½ B: col. b, 2p6 v -2q1 v 2½ Lear (2q2-2s3) -- Othello (2s3 v -2v6) B: 2s3 v -2v6 30 Antony and Cleopatra (2v6 v -2z2 v B: 2v6 v -272 v 29 Cymbeline (2z3-3b6) B: 2z3-3b6 31 Hamlet, then, ends with compositor B setting type; Othello opens with the same compositor at work; Lear intervenes. It was not a practice of the Folio compositors to change at the beginning of a play; they set by pages rather than by act, scene, or play. Their usual habit was to continue from one play to another unless they were at the end of a gathering or a section. There are only two demonstrable changes of compositors at the beginning of a play that is not also the beginning of a new gathering or section: at the beginning of 1 Henry IV, compositor A takes over from B (04), and at the beginning of Macbeth, compositor A again takes over from B (2l6); against these two instances we have at least fifteen occasions when the compositor who set the latter part of a play continued to set the beginning of the following play. 5 It is not impossible but indeed more likely that compositor B, who set the last pages of Hamlet, should continue to set the beginning pages of Lear . Nor must one believe it would be impossible for one compositor to set a whole play. Compositor A, early in the setting of the Folio, had set Two Gentlemen of Verona in its entirety, and compositor B had set all of Twelfth Night and Timon . The situation of a compositor setting four plays consecutively is unique in the Folio but not unlikely. From this evidence, found in plays surrounding Lear, one notes that in the four plays preceding Lear compositor B set 72 pages to A's 23 pages. Since B set more and more pages until finally he was setting three plays alone, it seems not unlikely that the pattern which is clearly established in the plays of Othello, Antony, and Cymbeline had its beginning in Lear . All of the large groups of pages from Timon through Hamlet are by compositor B: he set 24 pages (2g3 v -2h5 v ) in his largest group. Compositor A, on the other hand, set only 5½ pages in his largest group (2m2 v -col. a, 2m5). Certainly the preponderantly large groups set by any one compositor in this section are those by compositor B. Moreover, in Lear we find only one skeleton-forme present: if we had found two skeletons in use here our conclusion that only one compositor was setting type might well be suspect. Generally speaking, if we find two skeletons in use, we may find two compositors at work. 6 If we find only one skeleton in use, we may have either one or two compositors at work, but certainly, except in very special circumstances, two skeletons more likely may be equated with the work of two compositors than with one, especially in folio printing. It would be impossible for one compositor to maintain a speed in composing, rinsing, distributing, and attending to his other duties that would allow him to keep abreast of the press in a manner necessitating the use of two skeletons; and where we find one skeleton in use we are not forced to believe that two compositors were at work. Thus if we find evidence elsewhere of only one compositor at work, we need not consider that it would be impossible for one compositor to set the whole play. More important, however, than these technical points is the evidence that can be drawn from within the play itself. The detailed examination of the variant spellings within the play, following the method evolved by Mr. Hinman, revealed certain words where the compositor who set Lear had a very marked preference for certain spellings. To confirm these preferences, a similar spelling test was undertaken for Antony and Cleopatra, and Othello, plays definitely set by compositor B. For comparison with these spellings, an examination of compositor A's portions of Macbeth and Hamlet disclosed truly preferential spellings of both compositors. This comparison not only revealed that Lear was set by one compositor but furnished other test words to add to Mr. Willoughby's test. 7 A summary of this examination is as follows: A Spelling B Spelling Lear Spelling deare (17) deare (0) deare (2) deere (0) deere (59) deere (26) does (17) does (31) does (1) doe's (1) doe's (2) doe's (1) do's (1) do's (25) do's (15) beene (13) beene (4) beene (8) bene (3) bene (6) bene (1) bin (3) bin (24) bin (19) deuil (5) deuil (2) deuil (0) diuel (0) diuel (34) diuel (2) sirra(h) (0) sirra(h) (5) sirrah (8) sirrha (1) sirrha (0) sirha (1) sirra (0) sirra (0) sirra (1) houre (9) houre (28) houre (9) hower (3) hower (0) hower (1) howre (0) howre (1) howre (1) vilde (0) vilde (9) vilde (4) vile (2) vile (0) vile (0) vild or vil'd (2) power (3) power (18) power (9) powre (0) powre (7) powre (8) breefe (0) breefe (4) breefe (2) briefe (2) briefe (2) briefe (1) yong (0) yong (15) yong (10) young (2) young (6) young (5) blood (16) blood (31) blood (12) bloud (5) bloud (3) bloud (1) The very close correspondence between compositor B's preferential spellings and those found in Lear indicate clearly that the tentative assumption made at the first in the investigation was correct: all of Lear was set by compositor B. Where the simpler test of Mr. Willoughby failed to reveal the compositor of a third of the play, the more detailed examination of all the significant variants established the compositor of all the play. But there remains one further point that may be suggested as accounting for certain minor divergences in compositor B's preferential spellings in Lear . In the first place, we must not expect a compositor to spell certain words in an invariable way. Mr. Willoughby has already pointed out the possibility of a compositor's varying the spelling of words, and Mr. Hinman has enlarged upon that possibility: occasional copy-spellings will come through; justifying of lines will affect preferential spellings; the diminishing of a certain sort usually employed in preferential spellings may lead him to varying his spellings; and insistence, either by editor or author, upon copy-spellings for rhyme words, or even a compositor's own idiosyncrasies, may cause variants. Finally, Mr. Hinman concludes, . . . there are doubtless hosts of little part-psychological, part-muscular influences too subtle for analysis which may, on occasion, cause variations: such, perhaps, as the atmosphere created in the compositor's own mind by his text, so that he sets bin in a low-comedy speech by a yokel, but beene a few pages later in a very pompous speech by the king—though the copy has the modern been in both places (pp. 79-80, note 1). Taking these "part-psychological, part-muscular influences" in connection with Mr. Hinman's declaration that "a book is always likely to contain an occasional copy-spelling," we may account for the slight divergence from preferential spellings that we find in Lear . Perhaps one of the factors that cause variation from preferential spellings should be emphasized here. In the plays where Mr. Willoughby's test works best, the compositor is setting from manuscript. Here in Lear, as in Midsummer Night's Dream, Merchant of Venice, and Romeo and Juliet where Mr. Willoughby conjectured unknown compositors, the play was being set from printed copy. It is probable that the printed copy has much more effect upon a compositor's spelling than has been previously recognized. It may be that if a compositor meets a word in manuscript he will set that word in his own spelling far more often than if he meets that word in print. Although this is a difficult point to prove, we must remain aware that part-muscular influences, coupled with a respect for the printed word, may be at work on the compositor when he is setting type from a printed page which is acting as copy. We may have, therefore, a situation where a compositor meeting "do" in a manuscript will impose upon it his usual spelling; but if he meets "do" in a printed text, he may accept readily the spelling that is there, either do or doe or doo. This influence of the printed word can be demonstrated in other ways, such as the use of italics, the following of unusual spellings, the printing of erroneously abbreviated speech-headings and the like, which have long been noticed by bibliographers. Thus where we have a play being reprinted from a previously printed copy, we need to apply more comprehensive tests than the five-word test of Mr. Willoughby and to examine the play using another criterion for compositor-determination. 8 The principle that one must follow here in determining the compositor of a play set from printed copy is this: he must examine the spellings of the copy as well as those of the reprint, noting what changes have been made in the spellings. If a doe spelling is retained, it does nothing towards indicating the compositor; if, however, it is changed to do without some other factor such as line-justification intervening, we may note that as a very definite indication of the compositor. This principle proved successful in the compositor determination of Lear. 9 But whatever the value of this principle, it is apparent, I believe, that Lear was set by one compositor, B, of the Folio. And this information is no academic exercise in a theoretical desert. With the identification of the compositor secure, we can undertake an examination of compositor B's work elsewhere in the Folio where he was setting type from printed copy; then, and only then, can we produce demonstrable evidence about his characteristic handling of copy. And that, a longer story, must be reserved for the present; but in spite of its length, it is an important one for those who wish a text of Lear that is as close as possible to Shakespeare's "fair copy." For the compositor of the Folio text of Lear did make certain characteristic changes in his text; and whatever the authority of the "Pied Bull" Quarto, it has more authority than the changes made by a Jacobean workman, compositor B of the Folio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "The Spelling of the First Folio," TLS (June 3, 1920), p. 352. 2 Seventeen of these words occur but once in each part, and therefore they may be dismissed as of little significance; seven others differ only by the doubling of a final consonant ( eternal/eternall ) or of a medial one (rubs/rubbes), but at times the evidence here is contradictory. Nine words, however, appear to be significant: afraid/affraid, countreyes/countries, deare/deere and dearest/deerest, maiestie/maiesty, thick/thicke, traytor / traitor, weyward / weyard, and beene/bin . 3 "Principles Governing the Use of Variant Spellings as Evidence of Alternate Setting by Two Compositors," The Library, 4th ser., XXI (1940), 78-94. 4 Another test, which confirmed these findings, is that of A. K. McIlwraith: see "Some Bibliographical Notes on Massinger," The Library, 4th series, XI (1930), 87-91. This test deals only with scene headings, stage directions, and speech prefixes which often are set in characteristic ways by compositors, but here again no demonstrable two-compositor pattern emerged. 5 See, for example, the continuity of compositor between The Tempest and Two Gentlemen; Two Gentlemen-Merry Wives; Measure for Measure-Errors; As You Like It-Taming of the Shrew; Shrew-All's Well; All's Well-Twelfth Night; King John-Richard II; Richard II-1 Henry IV; 1 Henry IV-2 Henry IV; Henry V-1 Henry VI; 1 Henry VI-2 Henry VI; 3 Henry VI-Richard III; Richard III-Henry VIII; see also table above for further examples. In each of these instances the compositor who was setting at the end of a play continued to set at the beginning of the following play. 6 I realize the exceptions that occur with such a generalization. For instance, the Q Lear (1608) was machined with three skeletons; yet only one compositor was at work: see Fredson Bowers, "An Examination of the Method of Proof Correction in Lear, " The Library, 5th ser., II (1947), 20-44; and Philip Williams, "The Compositor of the 'Pied-Bull' Lear, " Studies in Bibliography, II (1949), 61-68. But this is a very unusual occurrence. I hope to present in the near future a detailed examination of the use of one or two skeletons during the printing of the Folio. 7 Incidentally, this examination confirmed in certain particulars the conjectured preferential spellings advanced by Mr. Satchell. But because it was much more inclusive than his restricted area of one play, it furnished much more solid evidence that he could give at that time. 8 In order to demonstrate the validity of this hypothesis, I examined ten plays in the Folio that were set from printed copy. In six plays the compositor is not determined by the five-word test: Much Ado, Love's Labor's Lost, Midsummer Night's Dream, Merchant of Venice, Titus, and Romeo and Juliet . Two of the plays that underwent extensive revisions, Richard III and Lear, have partly determined compositors. Only two of these plays, Richard II and Troilus, have definitely determinable compositors. 9 This method of examination may yield some evidence concerning the compositor(s) of certain Shakespeare plays in the Folio that now are classed as by "unknown compositor(s)." If it does not identify the compositor(s), it at least will exclude the possibility that those plays have been set by the known compositors, A and B.</field>

Such, in brief, is the account of an issue considered only as a freak in the days of Lowndes and Bohn, then regarded as "one of the earliest impressions" by Lenox, Winsor, Cole, and Pollard, and finally accorded preeminence over all in the exhaustive study published by Robert Metcalf Smith. 1 When confronted by this imposing array of "firsts," in point of issue for book and poem, in two great names now conjoined in a single text, and in the roster of scholars who have labored to establish and justify the present hypothesis, it ill becomes an upstart to trample upon the work of generations and subvert the tradition that work has produced. And yet, if the facts of printing invalidate critical theories, it is the bibliographer's unbecoming duty to present them. Certainly the facts allow us to accept the premise common to all discussions of the problem: We are indeed concerned with several issues of the Second Folio, each conveying a different setting of Milton's Epitaph on Shakespeare. Beyond this, however, I must demur and eventually dismiss all contentions as irrelevant. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Order of Issues The issues of this Folio are distinguished by three settings of the letterpress for A2.5 of the initial quire, a sheet containing on the recto (outer forme) of one leaf the title to the work, and on the recto (inner forme) of the other several commemorative verses on the author. Two of the three settings for the title also exist in a number of states, usually identified by alterations in the impressions for Robert Allot, one of the principal shareholders, or by the special imprints provided for his collaborators. Between the variants for both leaves there is an obvious correlation best described, in Smith's terminology, as: Allot 1 associated with Effigies A; Allot 2-3 with Effigies B; and Allot 4-5, Aspley, Hawkins, Meighen, and Smethwick, all with Effigies C. To substantiate this sequence, insofar as it applies to the Allot variants, Professor Smith believed that we may "assume, with a high degree of probability, that the order of the title-pages follows the order of improvement, since it is readily demonstrable that the compositor or compositors tried to correct in every succeeding title-page mistakes made in the preceding one." 3 The probability, it seems to me, is at times very remote. Where the corrections occur within the setting, as in Allot 2-3 and Allot 4-5, the intent and direction of improvement is apparent. But where the corrections require a completely new setting, as in the transition from Allot 1 to 2 and from 3 to 4, the necessity of such extraordinary measures for such trifling results remains obscure—at least under the present assumption. Even more remarkable is the fact that whenever the compositor of the title discards his forme the compositor of the Effigies page also discards his at precisely the same time. This means that the two men, working together and in the same incomprehensible fashion, twice distribute the entire letterpress for the sheet, twice prepare others, and in the process aimlessly fritter away the hours (days, I should say) shuffling and reshuffling countless reglets, wedges, quoins, quads and spaces, as well as some 4960 sorts 4 —all this, we note, to arrange a few "improvements" which any dolt could have managed in five to ten minutes with several pieces of type. In view of this circumstance, one unparalleled in the annals of bibliography, the inclination is to cast about for another hypothesis wherein these seeming absurdities are reasonably explained. For the moment, though, let us consider what else may be said for our diligent compositors and their heroic struggle to improve the text. In the sentence following the one cited, Smith assured us that "this assumption acquires a certainty with the demonstration of typographical links between successive title-pages." 5 Between the first two settings there is assuredly, not only a typographical connection in the employment of the same fonts of type, but also, as Smith elsewhere observes, a further correlation in the use of the same variety of paper. Obviously, then, these two were prepared within a relatively short period. Between the second and the third, on the other hand, no similarity exists. In Smith's words, the type is "not identical," "in a different font," and the paper for the later setting is drawn "from another stock." 6 Thus by his own admission the "links" disappear, the demonstration fails, and the expected certainty resolves into an increasing distrust of the entire argument. If the premise is unsustained all that is based upon it is in imminent danger of collapse. At this impasse let us now turn to another theory immediately verified by evidence within the book and thereafter supported by every indication of relevance to this inquiry. Contrary to the received opinion, this would suppose that the Title-Effigies sheet was, for various reasons, deliberately underprinted and then, as the occasion required, twice reset at some later time to dispose of remainders. The sheet identifying each of the subsequent issues might therefore, in this view, be properly regarded as a "reprint," and like all reprints would presumably convey readings inferior to those in its copytext. Possibly, then, the order is the reverse of that alleged, and the sequence one of degradation rather than improvement. Some credence is given this presumption by the questions the publishers themselves might have raised. Why run a complete issue of the most expensive sheet 7 in a very costly book? Since this was not an original edition, why imprint their names to something which might still be on the shelves some twenty years after they were gone and forgotten? Why not print just enough for their immediate needs and let events determine whether they, or their successors, should print again? 8 Should these or other considerations have convinced them—and now convince us—of the advisability of limiting the original issue, the publishers of the Second Folio may be credited with greater foresight than those of the Third and Fourth; for while they eventually chose not to alter the original make-up in successive printings, their precaution obviated any necessity for cancellation, a necessity later enforced upon their less perceptive successors. 9 For the thesis, as now proposed, several pieces of evidence may be advanced, all tending to the same conclusion. In his examination of the correlations among the three settings Professor Smith neglected to observe that the two which are actually connected have no relation to the rest of the book, whereas the third, though independent of the others, is very closely affiliated both in the ornamental letters and in the paper used for this setting. The ornaments in all issues, consisting of the letters "S" and "W" on the Effigies page, 10 are of three kinds, each cut in a manner that suggests their origin in three separate foundries. Group Effigies Ornamental block 1 C "S" against a filigreed background 1 C &amp; B "W" against a similar background 2 A Type "S" within a wreathed factotum 3 B "S" against a broad leaf background 3 A "W" against a similar background Among these only group 1 is represented in the Folio. 11 As with the ornaments, so with the paper: that used for the settings commonly described as the first and second (Heawood 594) does not appear elsewhere in this book or in any other book of this date, but that used for the setting usually considered to be the third (H 1420 or 1731) repeatedly occurs in the last nineteen quires of the Folio. 12 Now since the preliminary sheet would normally be printed in conjunction with other work toward the end of the book, the identity in paper confirms the identity in ornaments and establishes a strong presumption for an order in which the "third" setting is distinguished as the first. Thus, in the absence of the slightest evidence to the contrary, the Allot 4-5—Effigies C sheet must be regarded as the original issue, carefully prepared from manuscript, and the others as mere reprints, hastily composed, badly centered and spaced, and obviously degraded in text. The exact order of the reprints may now be determined by the textual relationship among the title-pages. Table I Issue I II III [Smith] [Allot 4-5] [Allot 1] [Allot 2-3] Line 1a M r . M r .

Church-yard, From Table I 13 it will be observed that, on this score alone, Allot 1 cannot be designated as the first in a sequence of issues gradually "improving" in the direction of Allot 5, for it is intermediate between 5 and 2, having seven variants in common with the one and three in common with the other. Hence for this reason, others previously adduced, and others yet to be divulged, I suggest that we reject the outmoded "Allot 1—5" classification and adopt one corresponding to the evident order of issues. Including only what I believe to be the first of the states in the initial setting (all of which will be dealt with in the next section) the three issues, with their variants, are identified as follows: Order Ia II IIIa IIIb [Smith] [Allot 5—Effigies C] [Allot 1—Effigies A] [Allot 2—Effigies B] [Allot 3—Effigies B] Description 1st issue, 2d issue 3d issue, 3d issue 1st state 1st state 2d state Paper H1731 14 H594 H594 H594 15 Ornaments on Effigies page 1,1 2,3 1,3 1,3 The inspection of a photostat from copy tentatively identified as a variant of the state now described as IIIb 16 leads me to believe that this is the artful work of a restorer. With the three issues properly identified, and properly arranged in sequence, we should now endeavor to fix the approximate time and circumstance of publication. For the later settings, as for certain Jaggard-Pavier quartos, there is some indication that the imprint is misleading in all of its particulars. Unquestionably, as the paper attests, issue I was printed and sold in the manner announced on the title page. But II and III, though distributed with a similar announcement, were produced on such unusual paper that an intensive search through the crown folios in several libraries 17 has disclosed its presence not before 1637 and then only in three books: certain leaves of the preliminary quire of Camden's Britain (1637), printed by Felix Kyngston and others; throughout in Paris's Historia maior (1640), by Richard Hodgkinson; and occasionally as a single sheet in Parkinson's Theatrum Botanicum (1640), 18 ostensibly by Thomas Cotes, the printer of the Second Folio. Moreover, as the investigation has also revealed, the distinctive mark for this paper seems to exist only in the two states required for a single pair of moulds; 19 and as neither of these states shows any sign of deterioration the inference follows that the period of manufacture approximates the dates of the books in which the paper was found. It is quite probable, therefore, that the later issues of the Shakespeare Folio were sold, not by Robert Allot in 1632, but by his successors sometime between 1636 and 1641. Within that period occur four significant events, any one of which might have provided a suitable occasion for reissue: (1) an inventory of Allot's effects subsequent to his death in 1635; (2) a transfer of the stock by his widow Mary to Legatt and Crooke on the first of July, 1637; (3) the gradual accumulation of unsold copies returned to the new proprietors upon the demise of Allot's original collaborators, all of whom had died between 1636 and 1641; 20 and (4) still another inventory, in 1641, upon the death of Thomas Cotes, the printer of the original issue and part owner of the stock. Of these the most plausible circumstance is the last. Under any other condition we would expect to find issues with Legatt's imprint and Crooke's name as publisher. But since these do not appear, and since, in any event, neither Legatt nor Crooke was in possession of the paper, engraving, or ornaments used for these issues, 21 their origin may be traced to certain untitled lots originally reserved for Cotes and now brought forth upon their discovery in 1641. At this time, as stipulated by the will, Thomas's younger brother Richard assumed possession of the stock, the printing shop, and all implements therein. 22 That Richard should have failed to enter his name on the titles is not surprising, for of all the established printers of the day his record is distinguished by a penchant for anonymity. So far as I can discover, within the STC period, his name appears alone as printer on only two books, both undated. 23 Only once is he associated with a printer other than Thomas, and on the occasions when he is entered with his brother he usually withdraws his name from subsequent editions. 24 Books in which he had a considerable interest, such as the nine owned jointly with his brother 25 or the nine owned exclusively by himself, 26 appear invariably with the name of Thomas alone, never his own. Even for the Second Folio, an enterprise in which his investment was twice that of his brother's, 27 comparable to Allot's, and equivalent to the total advanced by the minor shareholders, the colophon and imprints register the names of all but the self-effacing Richard Cotes. Apparently, if this practice has any significance, the greater his responsibility and—we may presume—the greater his share of the presswork, the less his inclination to acknowledge it. Much of what is nominally under the imprint of Thomas may, then, be justly attributed to his silent partner. Of all the books to which I have alluded, only one bears any particular relationship to the later issues of the Folio, and in every respect the correlation is complete, exact, and irrefutable. This, we should now recall, is the Theatrum Botanicum (19302), a volume which contains in some copies the rare and elusive watermark also found in these issues. Here then is the crucial exhibit: a book published within a year of the inventory of Thomas's effects, with paper and ornaments like those in the sheet applied to the remainders presumably discovered in that appraisal, and with an imprint assigning the presswork to one man when it was actually the property and almost certainly the work of another. Faced with this series of coincidences, I find it impossible to avoid the conclusion that the title-pages for these issues, now reading "Printed by Tho. Cotes, for Robert Allot . . . 1632", 28 should be understood as "Printed by and for Richard Cotes . . . 1641 or later." Thus, at last, the esteemed "first" and "second" issues—the erstwhile "Allots 1—3," so enshrined by the earlier bibliographers and so avidly pursued by collectors everywhere—are now revealed to be, in all the light that can be shed upon them, nothing more than sweepings from the warehouse floor. Whether these scraps are entitled to remain within the pale of the Short-Title Catalogue is not for me to decide. I am content to present here the circumstantial evidence and, later, a proper motive for Richard's action in reissuing the book in the manner described. 29</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Order of Variants in the First Issue Whatever his doubts and reservations concerning the hypothesis just presented, the reader will readily agree that for the issue now identified as the first the present alphabetical arrangement of the imprints may not necessarily correspond to their chronological order through the press. That is determined, we suspect, by the convenience of the compositor. Normally, as his interest, like that of us all, is in doing as much as possible with the least amount of effort, he may be expected to plan his work so that it requires a minimum of labor to effect the alterations he must perform. Both within and between the several states of the title-page we should therefore look, not for drastic changes back and forth in aimless manner, but for the slight and deliberate adjustments which link all variants in a certain progression. As illustrated in the accompanying plate, the letterpress for the title is disposed in three groups: (1) the heading, consisting of the seven lines of type above the area later to be filled by the portrait; and, below this area, (2) the place, comprising the single word LONDON, and (3) the imprint consisting of the two lines which relate to printer, publisher, address, and date. Group (1), of the same type throughout the impression, is, with one exception, fixed in its position; (2) is also, generally, of the same type, but occasionally moved as a consequence of the adjustments immediately below it; (3) is of two distinct settings of type, the position of which differs from state to state and, in one instance, within a state. Much of the variation in (3) is, of course, explained by the constant revision required to supply each of the collaborators in this edition with a distinctive imprint. Of the two settings employed for this purpose one comprises the imprint states Allot a, Allot b (formerly designated as Allot 5 and 4, respectively), Aspley d, and Meighen g; the other, Smethwick c, Hawkins e, and Hawkins f . 30 It will now be perceived that in any determination of the order we must contend with two kinds of alterations, hereafter arbitrarily distinguished as states and variants . The term state is used to denote a deliberate alteration in type, whether performed, supposedly, on press ( b, f ) or off press ( c—e, g ); the term variant to denote shifts within states in the position of the type, whether these appear as intentional adjustments on press ( a 2-3) or as accidental results off press ( c 2). The minimum deviation, laterally or vertically, which distinguishes a press variant has been fixed at two millimeters. Any discrepancy less than this is dismissed as a distortion caused by shrinkage in the paper. 31 Since two settings of the imprint are employed within the same impression it is obvious that the relation between them can be decided only by reference to type elsewhere in the forme which both have in common. This other type is unchanged except for a few copies of a and all copies of g . In the exemplars of what I believe to be the first variant, a state, the interval between the heading and the place 32 measures 206 mm., an interval soon reduced and thereafter maintained at 204 mm. in all succeeding variants and states. Quite possibly this was a deliberate adjustment to bring the several groups of type in closer proximity to the portrait. In g we observe several alterations—or, possibly, substitutions—in the two N s of the word LONDON . For the earlier states the lower right kern of the first N is bent slightly upward and the upper left kern of the second curled sharply downward. For this, however, the one kern is straight and the other only slightly curled. Another difference is evident immediately behind the descending stem of the second N where, in all but the g state, there appears a small speck. From these trivial discrepancies we may tentatively conclude that a is the first state, g the last, and that all other states including those represented by the other setting are interposed between them. Before considering the exact position of this other setting within the sequence, it will be necessary to prove the order within each setting. Further scrutiny of copies in the earliest state of the first setting—and of the entire sequence—discloses certain other refinements, all intended, I believe, to improve the appearance of the page. Shortly after the imprint was adjusted to 204 mm. it was noticed that SHAKESPEARES, the longest and most prominent word in the heading, though extending beyond the portrait (191x160 mm.), was several millimeters short of the margin established by the plate mark (200x169 mm.). 33 To remedy this the forme was again unlocked and the word spaced out from 166 to 169 millimeters. The combination of adjustments thus produces three distinct variants within the state: 34 Heading Interval 1. 166 mm. 206 mm. 2. 166 mm. 204 mm. 3. 169 mm. 204 mm. Like the earlier gradation, the later one, once arranged, persists in all remaining states. Preceding these slight and delicate adjustments is another which is grossly botched. Instead of replacing the foul case "f" in "ſold" either at the striking of proofs, or when the imprint was moved, or later, in state b, the pressman attempted to gouge out the offending projection, but succeeded only in bending it up and into the shoulder of the piece, where it gradually collected a "pick" and continued to clog the face of the type 35 until it was eventually removed at the end of work on the second state. While the later state b is strangely defective in this one respect, it does represent a further effort to enhance the appearance of the impression, notably in the substitution of ordinary type for the heavy-faced word "Printed". This too, we observe, is a correction retained in the later states of the imprint. Another alteration, the deletion of "at his ſhop", was arranged for a reason which will become evident at a later point in our discussion. Suffice it to say now that the order devised by Smith as b-a (Allot 4-5) disrupts the progression of his own sequence (where Allot 4, with the phrase omitted, intervenes between 3 and 5), disregards the actual relation between b and the states which succeed it ( d and g, both without the phrase), and ignores the indifferent practice observed in other books printed for Allot at this time. In these the imprint may be without address, 36 with the simple reference "at the Blacke Beare," 37 with the preliminary notation (as in b ) "at the ſigne of the Blacke Beare," 38 or with the full address (as in a ) "at his ſhop at the ſigne of the Blacke Beare." 39 If the publisher's address could be so variously rendered in these imprints, and his name so variously spelled as Allott, Allot, or Allet, it would appear that such decisions were not at his discretion but entirely at the convenience of the printer. And this convenience, as we shall have occasion to remark, was very directly involved in the alteration. Hence, I repeat, the order is probably in the direction of a-b, and the inclusion of the phrase in the later issues II-III is to be simply explained by the use of a copytext in its earlier state. The third imprint in this setting is obviously d, the Aspley state. Though this retains most of the type used for a and b (including the terminal phrases "at the ſigne" and "in Pauls Church-yard") the several revisions within the lines doubtless necessitated its preparation off press. Again as in b (and occasionally in a ) the type is clogged in several places and the "n" of "in" is above the line. Among the idiosyncrasies not evident in b but later transmitted to g are the substitution of "ſ" for the previously mangled "f" in "ſold", a depression in the "e" and "t" of "be" and "at", and a battered "e" in "the". Peculiar to d alone, apparently, is the fact that in later copies of the impression in this state the title is a cancel. 40 What this signifies, I suspect, is an overrun on the lot of paper which had been reserved for all states through d, and the consequent necessity for the excision of the titles in excess of order and the impression of certain Aspley imprints by half-sheet imposition. In Meighen g, the final imprint in this setting—and in the sequence—the modifications are more extensive. Besides the usual substitution in the name, these include the two N s previously mentioned, on the next line, the use of "middle" for "ſigne", the word employed in all preceding variants, and in the last line an entirely new reading. Other than these the Meighen state has only one distinction, a broken comma after Cotes, doubtless caused by the constant shifting of the type below it in the preparation of the earlier states. For Smethwick and Hawkins, the several states comprising the second setting of the imprint, the compositor (or the overseer) again grouped together addresses which would necessitate only slight revision between impressions. As the other imprints had, generally, certain readings in common, so these share in the reading "at his ſhop". At some time during the printing of the earlier, Smethwick state the press was stopped, the type removed from the forme, and then returned to a position in which both LONDON and the imprint were three millimeters to the left (or right on the printed page) of the space they had formerly occupied. Very probably this interruption was of some duration—overnight, at least—for while the first run was on a heap of paper turned in one direction, the second is on a heap turned in the other. Both type and paper, then, confirm the existence of two variants: Position of LONDON (as printed) Watermark 41 c 1 63 mm. to right of margin In Effigies leaf [A5] 2 66 mm. to right of margin In title leaf [A2] The "margin" to which I refer is a hypothetical line abutting the left edge of the word SHAKESPEARES and extending perpendicularly from that word. Next and last is the Hawkins imprint, with LONDON disposed as in c 2, but with the beginning of the final line reading first ( e ) "Chancery Lane", and then, as usual in Hawkins' address 42 ( f ), "in Chancery Lane". For the other instance of a correction at press ( b ) the deletion of three words required a readjustment of the imprint. For this insignificant addition, however, the compositor was content to leave the line slightly off-center. At this juncture I must confess that while I have, to the best of my ability, defined and ordered all the points that appear on the title-page of the first issue, I have established a sequence which pertains only to the order of composition within each setting, and not to the order of variants through the press. Were the imprint of a single setting the order for both would be, of course, the same. But since there are two, a question arises concerning the necessity for the second. If eleven words are, as we see, applicable for all states, why does the compositor go to the trouble of preparing another setting? The only plausible explanation is that the provision of this other setting enables two men to work efficiently and simultaneously at their separate tasks. While the compositor is revising and adjusting the imprint in one slug the pressman can work off copies on the other. Thereafter, as each finishes his assignment, the slugs may be transposed, and both can then continue to revise and print as before. The obvious advantage of the system must have immediately recommended it to the overseer, who doubtless classified the imprints in the two groups just described, ordered a separate setting for each, and arranged a schedule for their regular alternation through the press. To reconstruct this schedule we may now recall that if a and g have certain distinctions not common to the other states, then these two are at the extremes and the others alternately disposed between them. As ordered, this sequence is justified not only by the peculiarities in the terminal states, or by the progression within each setting, but also by certain links between the settings. In some copies of b 43 and all copies of c 1, for example, LONDON is displaced three millimeters to the right (or left on the printed sheet) of the position retained in the other states. Again, in some copies of c 2 and all copies of d the exemplars share an odd lot of paper (H1420) 44 not evident elsewhere. With c thus established as intermediate between b and d the inference follows that e-f is similarly intermediate between d and g, and that all states were therefore imposed in the order now assigned. 44a</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The Size and Distribution of Issues Through various discoveries and acquisitions in the years since Smith's census the record of extant Second Folios in perfect or impaired condition 45 may now be extended to include some 196 copies, or approximately one-fifth of the number estimated in the original edition. The existing copies constitute a rather large percentage, large enough, I believe, to provide a reliable index of the proportions among the states at the time of publication. I therefore offer, in Table II, several calculations, one projecting the ratio fixed by the extant copies and, as a check against this, another indicating a hypothetical distribution based on the investment of those participating in the edition. Table II Allocation on Evidence of Known Copies Number of perfect exemplars: 163 Percent of 1000 copies: 16.3 Allocation on Basis of Copyright Number of plays: 36 Copies per share 36/1000 or 27.8 &amp;c.mmat; 1000 Copies &amp;c.mmat; 1000 Variant imprint Copies Copies owned Copies c Smethwick 16 102.0 4 111.2 d Aspley 7 43.8 2 55.6 ef Hawkins 9 56.3 1 27.8 g Meighen 6 37.5 1 27.8 "Cotes &amp; Allot" [125] [791.4] [28] [778.4] Subtotals: a 31 203.8 b 73 456.3 II 14 87.5 III 7 43.8 The remarkable correlation between these two sets of figures, each derived from a different premise, undoubtedly brings us very close to what must have been the actual distribution. Only in Hawkins is there an appreciable discrepancy, and this, I believe, can be compromised by reference to the property held by the minor shareholders. Any evaluation, whether of plays or of real estate, involves a consideration not directly related to the size of the piece. Hawkins had only one play, true, but this was Othello, a possession certainly equivalent in value to both of the plays owned by Aspley ( Much Ado and 1 Henry IV ) and twice the value of the single play owned by Meighen ( Merry Wives ). Between these two figures, then, the one which measures only the size of the property should very probably be ignored in deference to the one which evidently signifies its importance. With this much rationalized (at least to my own satisfaction) we may confidently reconcile the slight disparity in the estimates for all states by adjusting the figures to the practical limits determined by the quires of paper, i.e., to the nearest multiple of 24. I a b c d ef g II III Total Quires 8 19 4 2 2 1 4 2 42 Issue 192 456 96 48 48 24 96 48 1008 Total issue 864 96 48 1008 This tabulation serves to enforce earlier considerations and leads to others still unresolved. For one, it will be observed that the order of imposition in the original issue, as previously determined, corresponds both to the extent of the copyright and hence to the size of the allotment for each of the proprietors. First off the press were the 27 quires of title-sheets for Allot and Cotes, then 4 for Smethwick, 2 each for Aspley and Hawkins, and finally a single quire for Meighen. For another, it should be noted that the total for all issues is within one quire of what the stationer calls a "perfect bundle," 46 the most convenient set-out for an edition of this size. Both in whole and in part the figures therefore conform to the general estimate of the extent of the edition and of its various states. The matters unresolved and deliberately evaded until now relate to the occasion for the alteration in the Cotes-Allot imprint a-b and the reason for the excessive delay in the production of the later issues II-III. Since neither of the imprints in the first issue can be regarded as a correction of the other, we may surmise that the two were used so that the warehouseman could readily distinguish the lots to be sent forward to Allot from those to be retained by Cotes. In the preparation of the edition both of these partners, like Jaggard and Blount before them, were acting in behalf of certain unnamed associates as well as for themselves. The 28 "copies" assigned to both by imprint or, rather, the stock represented by these copies, was therefore not entirely theirs by right but by purchase from owners who had relinquished any interest in the sale of their property. Table III identifies the owners of these copies, the proportionate share of their investment, and, for comparative purposes, certain other figures from our earlier estimate. Table III Entitlement Represented by Cotes-Allot Owner 47 Interest Plays [multiples of 24] Titles in state Robert Allot (½)} As indicated, {8 192 I a (192 copies) Thomas Cotes (¼)} part ownership {4} 96} Richard Cotes (¼)} in 16 plays. {4} Richard Cotes exclusive title 4} 192} I b (456 copies) Thomas Hayes " " 1 24} Nathaniel Butter " " 1 24} [Surplus: appropriated by Cotes brothers?] 120} Unassigned, presumably derelict 6 144 II,III (144 copies) --- --- Total: 792 792 Since Allot was entitled only to 192 copies, the equivalent of those estimated in state a, it would seem that this imprint, describing the place of sale as "at his ſhop", is the one that identifies his consignment. Apparently, then, the lots with the abbreviated imprint b, those not sold 'at Allot's shop', were reserved for the Cotes brothers and their unnamed associates. Included in these, we note, are the 336 copies belonging to them by right or purchase and, as our speculations lead us to suppose, 120 others over and above their pro-rata share. Possibly, if there was any such surplus, some or all of it may have been baled up at the Cotes warehouse and dispatched to booksellers outside London for sale in the provinces. 48 Besides these, however, there was still another lot which they could neither publicly claim nor privately appropriate for themselves—the 144 copies subject to seizure by the unknown owners of the six derelict plays. This group was discreetly laid aside, without titles, until such time as the claimants might identify themselves and secure their proper share with the imprint they might desire. For nine years or more the brothers Cotes awaited the heirs of the registered owners. Finally, after the inventory of 1641, Richard Cotes assumed the rights which others had allowed to lapse, and provided the remainders with new imprints copied from a sheet of the original issue. 49 These then appeared at the bookstalls with the titles identified as II and III. Richard's motive in disguising these two issues was, we may believe, very prudent, if not entirely commendable. Quite apart from his customary habit of operating under his brother's name, there was now another and more compelling reason, that of avoiding a confiscation of all remainders under the Ordinance of 1641. This specifically prohibited the printing, and hence the sale, of any book without the express consent of the owners. 50 But who were the owners of these six plays? Whoever they were, Cotes must have reasoned, their failure to contest the issue of 1632 amounted to an abandonment of the property to which they were then entitled. What was apparent to Cotes, however, as he doubtless realised, might not be apparent in the eyes of the law. Hence, rather than invite litigation, he passed these remnants off as the original issue and stood ready to defend them as part of an edition published long before the Ordinance was in effect. Even in his most sanguine moments, though, he could hardly have anticipated the ruling of Shakespeare's bibliographers that the special sheets were to be regarded, not only as coeval with the original issue, but as a series of states preceding it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. The Effigies Leaf In this and the following section I approach two considerations, one of such importance that a single commentary on the subject attained a circulation, if we may believe the author, of some 20,000,000 copies, 51 the other of equal importance but generally disregarded, both intimately related to all that has gone before, and both easily dispatched (the reader will be glad to know) on the warrant of evidence already adduced. The first of these pertains to leaf A5, the recto of which bears two commendatory verses on Shakespeare, one by an unknown author "Vpon the Effigies of my worthy Friend," the other Milton's earliest printed English poem, titled as "An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet". Since this page is conjugate to the title and, like its mate, appears in three different settings, the established order for the one leaf enforces a similar order for the other. Without further ado I therefore present, in Table IV, an account of the textual and typographical variation among the issues. Table IV Issue I b II III [Smith] [C] [A] [B] Line 3 VV W W 4 ["S" initial 1] [2] [3] 6 Comicke Comicke Comick 9 paſsions [ ſs ligatured] paſsions [ ſs separate] paſſions [ ſſ separate] 11 Shake-ſpeare Shakeſpeare Shake-ſpeare 13a Poet, Poet Poet, 13b VV W W 13c Shakespeare Shakespeare Shakeſpeare 14a ["W" initial 1] [3] [1] 14b honour'd honour'd honor'd 17a Vnder Under Vnder 17b -ypointing -ypointed -ypointing 18 Fame Fame Fame 22a whil'st [ st ligatured] whil'st, [ st ligatured] whil'ſt [ ſt ligatured] 22b -endevouring -endevouring -endeavouring 22c Art Art, Art 25a Impreſsion Impreſsion impreſsion 25b tooke tooke: tooke 28 lie lie, lie From this it will be immediately observed that, while Smith's representation of "each succeeding version [in the order A-B-C as] being printed from its immediate predecessor" is manifestly untrue, the statement is just as inapplicable for the order I-II-III. 52 But where Smith was forced to this contention by his arbitrary arrangement of the title-pages, no such obligation rests upon us. Though the order for title and Effigies page is, we reaffirm, identical, the copytext furnished the two compositors need not always be the same. For II both followed I, the only available text. For III, on the other hand, two different copies were passed to the compositors, a sheet of II to the man setting the title, a sheet of I again to the man setting the Effigies page. Thus the text descends directly for one page and collaterally for the other. 53 To clarify the relationship I offer four stemma, the first illustrating my own explanation, the second conforming to Smith's, the third and fourth exemplifying others which might be advanced. The difficulty with (2), we note, is the absence of any textual link between Title III and I or between Effigies II and III; with (3) and (4) the presence of an eclectic text in Effigies I; with all three the assertion of priority to issues containing paper and ornaments not found before 1637. Aside from all other considerations, these impediments alone are insurmountable. A comparison of Effigies I b 54 with the page I have reproduced now leads to another discovery, 55 another predicament, and another solution. The facsimile provided here is of an earlier state a in which the readings for the Effigies poem differ slightly from the usual version. Poem line: 3 4 6 I a Commicke Laughe , riſe I b Comicke Laugh , riſe, In the correction of this page the compositor dutifully moved the single word after Comicke to close the gap created by the excised m, but neglected to justify the deletion in Laugh, perhaps because there were seven words in this line. Thus between the comma and the following word an en space appears as witness to his indolence. In a the peculiar readings are such that they cannot intervene between others ( e.g., between III and I b in Smith's sequence) but must precede those in all three issues. 56 The predicament arises when we attempt to correlate state a of the Effigies page with state a of the title for this issue. The order in one, presumably, should correspond to the order of the other. Except for a chance conjunction in a made-up copy, 57 however, this page occurs only with titles in state b . 58 If a single pressman handled both of these formes in succession then, despite all the evidence to the contrary, it would be necessary to reverse the order in one or the other sequence. But since the Cotes establishment is known to have had at least two presses, 59 we may adhere to the evidence for both states and argue that the formes were machined simultaneously. In this manner each man would receive half of the sheets for the issue, and as these were worked off the two heaps would then be turned over and exchanged for the reiteration. The man printing the titles would therefore begin to perfect his companion's heap (topped, presumably, by the several sheets with Effigies in state a ) at a point midway through his own operation. And that point, as a reference to our schedule will show, 60 occurs just after he has printed 240 copies of b and while he has 216 yet to go. Again, it would seem, apparently irreconcilable facts combine to provide an almost certain conclusion. Indeed, the case is so neat in this instance that I venture to predict that state a of the Effigies leaf will be found conjugate only with state b of the title.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Historical Associations: The Charles I Copy In his account of certain notable copies of the Second Folio Professor Smith hurries over what was, for him, a relatively unimportant exemplar of "Allot 5" to humble himself before two others which he had exalted in the rank of "Allot 1". One of these was a copy first owned by King George III, then given to Dr. Burney when the latter withdrew his bid for the Allot 5 in question, eventually acquired by James Lenox, the American collector, and finally deposited at the New York Public Library. The other, once in the library of Thomas Howard, second Earl of Arundel, was donated to the Royal Society and thence passed through Sotheby's into oblivion. Both of these "treasures," as Smith calls them, were at various times offered to the British Museum, and both were as many times refused. Such persistent evidence of disrespect, though excused by Smith as occurring before the enlightenment of his "scientific bibliography," was nevertheless deplored on the grounds that the Museum had thereby denied itself the opportunity of acquiring copies immeasurably superior to those already in its collection. A reversal in the order of variants puts an end to this solicitude as quite ill-advised and allows an entirely different interpretation. Where the Museum authorities had once been admonished they are now to be congratulated, for with a sagacity not given to Shakespeare's professed bibliographers they have been careful to accept only the states proved to be the first—an a, two b s, and a c —and to reject on every occasion the unsightly specimens now demonstrated to be of subsequent issue. The same discrimination appears in the selections made for the other principal British libraries: all possess one or more copies of a or b, only a few the copies identified as of issue II (and these, no doubt, only at the insistence of misguided benefactors), and none the copies described as of issue III. Most of II and all of III were cast aside as the scraps to be gobbled up in the American market. Another consequence of this reversal is that the "Allot 5" Smith had slighted many years ago finally assumes its rightful position, not only as a, the first in the series of states in the initial issue, but as the only known exemplar with a provenance extending from the very date of publication to the present time. This is the book formerly in the possession of King Charles I and now, after many vicissitudes, in repose with other remarkable volumes in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. For the privilege of offering a summary account of this historic copy and a record of the inscriptions which it bears I am deeply indebted to Sir Owen Morshead, Librarian to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. As a representative of the a state this book, along with others similarly distinguished, was separated from the b group retained by the printers and dispatched first to Robert Allot, the chief proprietor. Some time before the day of publication Allot honored the custom 61 of forwarding the selected copy to the King's bindery, where it was suitably covered in morocco and gilt and then presented with a ceremony befitting the occasion. As even Milton was to admit, the King soon became a confirmed admirer of Shakespeare, no doubt as the direct result of this presentation, and in the enforced seclusion of his latter days often resorted to the book as "the closest companion of these his solitudes." 62 Toward the end of his stay at St. James's Palace Charles entrusted to Sir Thomas Herbert, his retainer, all the possessions which were then his to bestow—his books, his cabinet, his cloak, and his large silver watch 63 — and all of these Herbert faithfully preserved until his own death in 1682, when they were dispersed and, with the exception of the Folio, subsequently lost from view. An inscription in the copy testifies that it next appeared at the auction of Dr. Richard Mead's library in 1754, where it was purchased by Mead's friend and disciple Dr. Anthony Askew. Upon the death of Askew it was again placed on sale and bought by George Steevens at what he justly considered to be an "enormous price," unequalled at this time, 64 but soon to reach over thrice that amount when it was eventually purchased in 1800, at the Steevens sale, by a representative of George III. Not until the bidding had gone to £18-18-0 was it made known that the King desired the book, at which disclosure the participants, Charles Burney among them, immediately withdrew their offers. And so, after its strange and varied adventures, this precious volume was returned to the Royal Library, there to remain until today.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "The Variant Issues of Shakespeare's Second Folio and Milton's First Published English Poem: A Bibliographical Problem," Lehigh University Publications, II, No. 3 (1928). The death of Professor Smith on January 15 of this year brings to an end in time, but certainly not in memory, an association extending from my early days as an undergraduate. As it was he who first introduced me to the ways of scholarship and thereafter encouraged my interest in bibliography, I am confident that the present expression of this interest would have received his hearty approval. 2 With this disavowal I now assume responsibility for all errors and omissions in the presentation of my case. In the gathering of the necessary evidence, though, I gratefully acknowledge the interest of the Modern Language Association Committee on Research Activities for a grant in aid of my investigation, the helpful advice of Dr. Allan H. Stevenson on the variant paper in the Folio—a matter of crucial importance to my argument—and the generous assistance of curators throughout the country in reporting the peculiarities of the copies in their custody. To Dr. Giles E. Dawson and Dr. James G. McManaway of the Folger Library, Mr. H. Richard Archer of the Clark Library, and Mr. Herman R. Mead of the Huntington Library I am under especial obligation for the time and energy they have devoted in my behalf. 3 Op. cit., p. 13. 4 This is the total of sorts in the title page (247) and the Effigies page (993), each twice distributed and twice re-composed. 5 Op. cit., p. 13. 6 Op. cit., pp. 20, 47. 7 As this sheet would require laborious composition (in the selection, spacing, and centering of type in different fonts) and a considerable amount of presswork (three operations, one for the inner forme [Effigies], one for the outer [title], and one again for the outer [portrait]), the total cost would be far in excess of that for any other. 8 Not now, but pertinent to a later stage of our discussion is another question: Why print titles for stock to which, in fact, they were not entitled? 9 As this contention has not been justified in the present description of the Fourth Folio, I ask the reader's indulgence until such time as I may offer my own account. 10 Since the Archer headpiece and similar blocks from the same matrix were commonly used by Cotes and others throughout this period, I disregard its appearance here. It has been noted in such books as STC 4510, 14813, 19302, 19654, and 22273. 11 In A6 r , adjoining Effigies leaf A5 r , both of these ornaments were used again, a clear indication that they were in the hands of the compositor as he prepared first one and then the other forme for the press. Elsewhere the "S" occurs at D2 r and d5 v , the "W" at al r and 2p2 v , and other letters of the same kind throughout the book. 12 So in my control copy DFo 35 . Heawood 1420 is a small fleur-de-lis, always in paper with chainlines approximately 23 mm. apart, and evidently existing in at least three different states. According to Dr. Stevenson's method (see fn. 15), I describe these as A 53x25mm. [7(13:12)10]—in DFo copy 2i3; B 54x25mm. [10(12:13)8]— in 2m1, 204-5-6, 2r3, 2y1; C 57x27mm. [8(15:12) 10]—in 2y4, 3a6, 3b1, 3b3, 3d1-2. Heawood 1731 is a large shield, usually indistinct, and measuring vertically either 137 or 141x54 mm. It appears in DFo copy at 3a5 and 3c2. So far as I have observed, H1420 is used as the title-effigies sheet only for some copies of the Smethwick-Aspley imprints, H1731 for all others. See further, fns. 40, 41. 13 Reference "ab" indicates two variants within the same word. Not cited are the unique variants "Coppies" in Allot 1, "according" in Allot 2, and the omitted phrase "at his ſhop" in Allot 4. 14 As stated before (fn. 12) H1420 is found only incidentally in this issue. 15 The sheet in InI copy of this state is not H594, but apparently of another Guesdon mould in the style of H576 without initials or date. The mark is on paper with chain-lines 21 mm. apart and measures 90x38 mm., dimensions which vary widely from those for H594 (fn. 19), or for still another variant of H576 recently described by Allan H. Stevenson ( Studies in Bibliography, IV [1951], 81). For an account of this copy and a sketch of the mark I am indebted to Miss Frances Stalker, Head of the Reference Department, Indianapolis Public Library. 16 See Giles E. Dawson's account of DFo 38 in TLS, Feb. 1, 1947, p. 65. The copy is now in storage. 17 By Dr. Stevenson at the University of Chicago library, by myself at the Harvard and Folger libraries. Heawood had previously specified Britain as containing the paper. 18 The mark is on leaf 3K5 of the Chicago copy, not observed in Folger exemplar. It is also noteworthy that this volume (STC 19302) contains all but one of the ornaments present in the several settings of A5 r of the Second Folio: the 1 "S" on four pages [3R5 v , 4D1 r , 6Y1 v , 7A4 r ], 1 "W" on four [4F2 v , 6H6 v , 6M1 r , 6S1 r ], 3 "S" on one [7A1 r ], and the peculiar 2 "S" factotum on no less than thirteen [B2 v , B4 v , C3 v , D3 r , G4 r , H6 r , 16 r , 3Y2 r , 4M2 r , 4R2 v , 5G2 r , 5H6 v , 6E6 r ]. 19 Mark H594 is a small Guesdon shield, 70x63 mm. The states appearing in the Folger copies are these: A 18[3:22:20:18]3 OUT and B 16[4:22:20:17]5 IN. A is in Second Folio copy 36 [issue II] A5; copy 15 [issue III] A5; Camden [Latham imprint] a 1, a 2; Paris C1, D2, F4, G2, G3, H5, I1, and on. B is in Camden a 3; Paris G6, H6, I2, I4, and on. Quite unnoticed by me, but quite apparent to Dr. Stevenson's gimlet eye is occasional evidence indicating the transfer and resewing of the mark in the A state. 20 Aldis and Plomer's Dictionaries record the dates as Hawkins c1636, Aspley and Smethwick 1640, and Meighen c1641. The return of any copies would, of course, be in satisfaction of liens against the estates of these associates. Copies so recovered might then be reissued with A2.5 intact or (see fn. 21) with the inappropriately imprinted A2 removed. 21 It is not inconceivable, though, that Legatt and Crooke may have acquired stock in the other ways described and remaindered this in the condition in which it was found. How else may we account for the extraordinary number of copies in defective condition? Altogether these comprise about sixteen per cent of all copies now extant, and practically every one lacks only the interior leaves A2 or A2.5. Surely the restorer is not to be held responsible for such an extensive and such a specific loss as this. More likely is the supposition that some copies, representing lots returned by Allot's associates (condition 3), were issued with the inapplicable titles deleted, and some others, representing lots discovered in the warehouse (1 and 2) were distributed in their originally imperfect condition, with both leaves absent. All we need do now is to differentiate the copies in these several categories from those whose deficiencies are of later date! 22 Plomer, op. cit., p. 53. 23 STC 15594, 16738. 24 17366-67, 24700-01, 25837-38. The other association is 19192. 25 267, 891, 900, 3174, 6724, 14704, 19389, 22274, 25789. 26 4694, 19248, 19302, 19846, 21068, 22339 [also in Greg's Bibliography, item 284 f ], 22502, 23541-42. One other (12017) appears without name in imprint. 27 Richard shared one-half interest with his brother in 16 plays and was the sole owner of 4 others: Titus Andronicus, Henry 5, and "Yorke and Lancaster" or 2-3 Henry 6. The Register entry for these (Nov. 8, 1630) also includes Pericles, a play not incorporated in the 2d Folio. 28 As Dr. Dawson has remarked, this in itself should be interpreted as "Printed by Thomas Cotes for himself and Robert Allot." Studies in Honor of A. H. R. Fair-child (U. of Missouri Studies, XXI, No. 1 [1946]), p. 19. 29 Since the date now assigned is not beyond dispute, even if supported by a motive, I urge those who remain unconvinced to search out copies of certain provenance or others with dated inscriptions. Of some interest in this connection would be a positive identification as to the issue of two copies for which the time of acquisition is known, i.e., one bought by Sir Thomas Barrington about 1637 and the other purchased for the Earl of Huntingdon in October 1638. [Francis R. Johnson, "Notes on English Retail Book-prices, 1550-1640," The Library, 5th ser., V (1950-51), 91-92.] 30 Hawkins imprint e, unrepresented in Smith's account, has since been described by Dawson in TLS, February 1, 1947, p. 65. Professor Smith did remark the identity in type between the Hawkins f and Smethwick imprints (p. 26), but as he was here, as elsewhere, bound by the traditional arrangement, failed to group the two together. 31 In view of McKerrow's warning against the reliability of any discrepancy amounting to less than 4 per cent, I should defend the validity of this precise distinction by noting, first, that the A2.5 sheet is fine quality crown paper, of uniform weight and consistency, second, that the differences appear only among a few copies in two of the seven states in this issue, third, that when they do appear they concern only a portion of the letterpress on the page, and fourth, that the deviation is generally corroborated by other evidence. For these several reasons I have no hesitation in citing such minutiae as indications of some disruption in the presswork. 32 Measured from the base of The ſecond Impreſsion (excluding descenders) to the top of the word LONDON . Only one copy (NN-Hawkins state) measures less than the common interval of 204 mm., but as the discrepancy is no more than 2 mm., and unconfirmed by any other difference, it has been disregarded. 33 It would seem that the engraving mangle, though carefully adjusted at first so as to center the impression between the two areas of type (see initial variant copies NNP and CLU-C [the latter reproduced in Smith, p. 23]), soon developed a "wobble" which scattered the impression at various angles in all succeeding variants and states. 34 The measurements apply to all copies seen and reported in this state except for CLU-C, described as 167-205, and CSmH, described as 166-203. These differences are so minute, however, that I have classified the copies as a 1 and a 2 respectively. 35 Especially toward the end of the run on state b .

In this and the preceding references it will be understood that the imprints are not, in all cases, identical but only equivalent to those cited in the text. 40 The paper previously identified as H1420 with chainlines 23 mm. apart (fn. 12) appears in all copies of this state, either as a full sheet (CLU-C, with w/m state C in Effigies leaf) or as the title-leaf (NN, w/m state A; other copies unwatermarked). In these others the disjunct leaf A5 has lines spaced either at 25 mm. (NN), the normal interval for the H1731 stock used elsewhere in the impression, or at 20 mm. (CSmH, NBuG), an interval for stock as yet unidentified. 41 Variant 2 has w/m as indicated in all copies known to me except for the two at CLU-C. In one of these the sheet is of the usual paper (H1731), but with w/m turned as in variant 1. In the other the sheet is of paper (H1420) found elsewhere only in copies with the Aspley imprint. The w/m for this, in state C, is in the title leaf. See preceding note. 42 Cf. Greg, items 171 b , 308, 360 c , 363 c-d , 379 c . 43 In a few copies of state b (e.g. DFo 37 ) the position is normal, 66 mm. to the right of the "margin"; but in most the position corresponds to that in c 1. Perhaps this displacement is to be accounted for, in part at least, by varying degrees of pressure applied against the side of the forme in lock-up. 44 See fns. 12, 40, 41. A reversal of this situation occurs in the last four quires of the book, where a few odd lots of H1731 intrude upon a run of H1420. 44a Through design or coincidence the order of imposition arranged by the overseer corresponds, with one exception, to the order of names in the colophon.

I here refer, of course, to the bundle provided for each sheet of the edition except the underprinted A2.5. 47 See Stationer's Record , as corrected in Greg's Bibliography , for November 16, 1630 (to Allot), June 19, 1627 (to Cotes Brothers), November 8, 1630 (to Richard Cotes), October 28, 1600 (to Hays), November 26, 1607 (to Butter). The derelict plays were Richard II, Richard III, and I Henry IV , last assigned to Law on June 25, 1603; Midsummer Night's Dream assigned to Fisher Ovtober 8, 1600; Troilus and Cressida entered to Bonian and Walley January 28, 1608/9; and King John , a play generally confused with Troublesome Reign . 48 In the several studies of the significance of variant imprints it has not been sufficiently emphasized that a considerable portion of the copies of any one edition may have been sold by persons unidentified in the imprint. One may recall several examples of this practice, notably the sale of a 2nd Folio by Richard Whitaker to Sir Thomas Barrington in 1637 (Johnson, op. cit., p. 87, 91), and Robert Allot's consignment to the Edinburgh bookseller Samuel Hart, on August 11, 1635, of some 13 books, only 3 of which carry his name as publisher. See Johnson's list, items 60, 115, 213, 252, 257, 258, 368, 390, 428, 454, and for the Allot books, 64, 234, 517. 49 The copy was, presumably, a proof-sheet of the earliest state a and not, under the present hypothesis, of the state b which had previously designated the Cotes allotment of copies. The earlier distinction would of course have been quite irrelevant to an issue in 1641. 50 Frank MacKinnon, "Notes on the History of English Copyright," Oxford Companion to English Literature, 2d ed. (New York, 1944), p. 879. 51 See Smith's account (pp. 40-45) of Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence's unorthodox publicity methods. Beginning with Sir Edwin's peculiar thesis at the turn of the century, the "Effigies" controversy is the story of error steadily compounded into the distorted form now accepted by Milton scholars. Among others, see Harris W. Fletcher (ed.), John Milton's Complete Poetical Works (Urbana, 1943), I, 365-366. 52 Smith, op. cit., p. 34.

Ligatured type peculiar to I: 9. 53 Under this arrangement starre-ypointing (17b), the crux of the Effigies controversy, occurs as the correct reading in the original issue I and in one of the two reprints of I. This simple deduction relieves us from the necessity of maintaining the usual argument that it was originally starre-ypointed, "corrected" in a new setting at Milton's insistence and then, for some inexplicable reason, "corrected" yet again in still another setting. Are we expected to believe that, for this page alone, it requires the handling of 3972 sorts to alter a suffix of two letters? See fn. 4. 54 Reproduced as "Effigies C" in Smith, p. 39; also in SQ, II (1951), 330. 55 The existence of this variant (then considered as an early state of the 3rd issue) was first noticed in a description of the Viscount Mersey copy (Sotheby catalogue, June 29—July 1, 1938, item 699) and subsequently, with a facsimile of the state, in Book Hand-book, I, nos. 7-8 (1950). I am indebted to Mr. Reginald Horrox, the editor of the Handbook, for the reference to Sotheby and for his strenuous but unavailing efforts to trace the Mersey copy. 56 For any other order the only explanation is one which depends upon the "lapse and recovery" hypothesis. The supposition for this is that the unattended compositor conscientiously endeavors to improve the readings from one reprint to another, and if he slips at any time supplies a reading at least as good as the original as he strives on nearer and nearer to perfection. The theory is very appealing, often proposed, and as often contradicted by strictly bibliographical evidence. 57 Pierpont Morgan copy 5126.

      <field name="heading_text">The Text of the Spectator by Donald F. Bond</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the many collections of eighteenth-century periodical essays none has been more frequently reprinted than the Spectator of Addison and Steele. By 1729, the year of Steele's death, at least twelve "editions" had been published by Tonson, and throughout the eighteenth century a steady stream of reprints and so-called new editions emanated from the presses of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin. From 1789 to the present six notable full-dress versions have appeared, with notes and some effort at editorial supervision. Yet, like the majority of eighteenth-century classics, there is no text of the Spectator in existence which enables us to read with even approximate accuracy the essays in a form approaching the intentions of their authors. The first text with any editorial supervision is the so-called Percy edition of 1789. Thomas Percy began to collect materials for this edition in 1764. On 24 April of that year he wrote to Farmer: M r Tonson is going to publish a new Edition of the Spectators, which he proposes to accompany with a few marginal notes. Can you furnish him with any illustrations, anecdotes, or names of concealed authors: or can you procure them from any of your friends? I am now ransacking the Biographia Britannica and other books of that kind for him. — Some personal and temporary allusions require clearing up, and these only it is proposed to annotate upon in as few words as may be. It is not perhaps too late to recover the key to these: but if delayed much longer it will become difficult, if not impossible: and then one of the most valuable works in our language will be handed down to posterity full of obscurities, which a few timely illustrations might have prevented. 1 It is clear from this letter and Percy's other correspondence that the chief concern in the new edition was that of providing explanatory notes and not that of a correct text. Percy eventually gave up the work when he became chaplain to the Duke of Northumberland, and his materials were turned over to John Calder, who with John Nichols ultimately brought out the edition in 1789. The value of this edition lies in its biographical and historical notes, not in its text, and the same is true of the two editions which followed at a short interval of time, the first by Robert Bisset in 1793, "with notes and lives of authors," and the other by Alexander Chalmers in 1806. It was not until 1868, with the appearance of the edition by Henry Morley, that any attempt was made to clear the text of the inevitable corruptions and "improvements" which had crept in with the numerous reprintings of the essays. At that time Morley estimated, on the basis of a sampling of forty numbers, that there were some three thousand textual corruptions in the Spectator . Many of these he deserves credit for having removed, though they have been reintroduced by subsequent editors. Though he is often vague in his account of the texts, Morley seems to have looked at the three original versions, and he sometimes, though not consistently, indicates variant readings in his footnotes. His edition remains to-day the most informative on textual matters. The only other editions with any pretensions to scholarly exactness are the two which appeared almost simultaneously in 1897 and 1898—those prepared by G. A. Aitken and G. Gregory Smith. Of these Aitken's is modernized in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, whereas Gregory Smith's professes to reproduce exactly such matters of eighteenth-century "style," even to the insertion of new catchwords at the bottom of the pages. Both announce themselves as based on the first 8vo edition, with occasional footnotes recording variant folio readings, and both ignore the first 12mo edition. Of the two, Aitken's is the less inaccurate, in spite of its modernization of style. The edition of Gregory Smith, the last volumes of which were brought out under pressure of time, reproduces in a strange manner errors to be found only in mid-eighteenth century reprints of the Spectator, and it introduces many other misreadings of its own. 2 This edition was reprinted in "Everyman's Library" in 1907, and in 1945 "reset with minor revisions," only a very small percentage of the errors being set right. Aitken's edition follows consistently, indeed slavishly, the first 8vo text, even when this is patently in error. Neither Aitken nor Gregory Smith appears to have made a thorough collation of texts. The three earliest and most important texts are the original folio sheets, the first 8vo edition, and the first 12mo edition. The original 555 numbers of the Spectator, printed on both sides of a folio half-sheet and published daily, except Sunday, from 1 March, 1711, to 6 December, 1712, came from the shops of Samuel Buckley and Jacob Tonson, Junior, which seem to have worked in pretty regular alternation, in order to get out the three thousand or more daily numbers which were called for. 3 A continuation, in which Steele had no share (numbers 556-635), was published by Buckley and Tonson thrice a week from 18 June to 20 December, 1714. The present study is concerned only with the original series. Before the Spectator had gone very far, the popularity of the essays invited a reprint in book form, and a subscription edition was undertaken by Tonson. The first two volumes of this edition in octavo (comprising the first 169 Spectators ) was announced in No. 269 (8 January, 1712) as ready for delivery. Ten days later, on 18 January, Volumes I and II were advertised in No. 278 as published in duodecimo, "a neat pocket edition" evidently designed for popular consumption, although the price of the volumes does not appear. Volumes III and IV, again in both 8vo and 12mo (comprising numbers 170-321), were published towards the end of 1712, about a month before the original series ceased daily publication. The 12mo edition is advertised in No. 533 (11 November, 1712) as "this day" published, and the 8vo edition seems to have come out about the same time, although there is no advertisement for this in the original sheets. 4 If the pattern of publication followed that of the first two volumes we may infer that Volumes III and IV appeared in 8vo about the first of November and in 12mo, as we have seen, on the eleventh. Volumes V, VI, and VII, completing the original series, appeared in both 8vo and 12mo on 11 April, 1713; and the continuation of the Spectator (comprising numbers 556-635) was published as Volume VIII, again in both 8vo and 12mo, on 1 September, 1715. 5 These three earliest editions—the Folio, 8vo, and 12mo versions—offer themselves as candidates for a basic copy-text. In addition, the reprint of Addison's eighteen Milton papers, published by Tonson in 1719, the year of Addison's death, under the title, Notes upon the Twelve Books of Paradise Lost, collected from the Spectator, contains numerous stylistic revisions and clearly possesses authority. The edition of Addison's Works, prepared by Thomas Tickell and published by Tonson in 1721, is not of great importance. Although Tickell had been designated by Addison as editor and the selection of material seems to have been made by Addison, the text of the Spectators reprinted there is demonstrably inaccurate and can in no sense be taken as the final version intended by the author. The editions, then, which have to be considered as possibly authoritative are the Folio sheets, the first 8vo edition, and the first 12mo edition, together with, for Addison's Milton essays, the 1719 collection of the papers on Paradise Lost . One has only to place the three texts of any number of the Spectator side by side to see that they differ widely, not only in punctuation, spelling, and capitalization, but in phrasing, in grammatical construction, and in literary style. For how many of these changes—in spelling, for example—were Steele and Addison responsible? How many were due to the style of the printing-house, or to the care—or negligence—of the compositor? Inadvertent errors disfigure all three texts, and many of those in the first 8vo reprint have been carried into modern editions. In No. 407, for example, the word "Pack-thread" is misprinted in 8vo as "Pack-threak," an error retained by Gregory Smith in his edition of 1897-98; in No. 376 the "Scream" of the criers in the streets is altered in 8vo to the meaningless "Stream," a substitution copied by both Gregory Smith and Aitken, and still uncorrected in the 1945 Everyman's Library reprint of Gregory Smith's edition. Some typographical errors, such as "impertiently" in No. 91 of the Folio text, remain in both 8vo and 12mo; others, such as "Inablity" (No. 151, Folio), are followed in 8vo but corrected in 12mo; still others, such as "preceds" (No. 285, Folio), are corrected in 8vo but allowed to stand in 12mo. Obvious errors of this sort can easily be noted of course and corrected, but other examples are less clear, In No. 290, for instance, the Folio reads "in Greatness of Sentiment," which the 8vo alters to "in greatness of Sentiments," a change from singular to plural followed by Morley, Aitken, and Gregory Smith. Again, in No. 310 the Folio reads "in like Manner," the 8vo "in a like Manner": Morley adopts the first reading, Gregory Smith and Aitken the second. Are the 8vo alterations in both cases instances of revision or of inadvertent error? Neither of the readings can be said to commend itself instantly on purely literary grounds. It soon becomes clear, in fact, that no one of the three earliest editions can be followed uncritically, because all contain errors in varying degree. The relationship of the three texts cannot be represented as the simple one of Folio copied by 8vo and 8vo copied by 12mo, but rather is one of considerable complexity. Collation of all the variants in the 555 numbers reveals that in certain portions of the text the 8vo and 12mo versions are indeed so identical as to imply complete dependence of 12mo upon 8vo; in other areas, however, the 8vo follows the Folio with little or no change, and the 12mo exhibits considerable variation; and in still other sections the 8vo deviates greatly from the Folio, with the 12mo agreeing with the Folio very closely. Since Tonson and Buckley not only worked alternately in the printing of the original Folio sheets but also, as we shall see, divided between them the work of bringing out separate volumes of both the 8vo and 12mo editions, a study of printing variants in the three texts of the Spectator offers an unusual opportunity of discovering to what extent printing practice determined changes in spelling, punctuation and the like, and how far these seem to have been due to the author. It will be of interest to apply here the theory, so persuasively stated by Greg, that the first printing of a text—which is alone set up from an author's manuscript—represents most faithfully the writer's intentions and that the farther away we get from the first printing the greater will be the opportunity for inadvertent changes and compositors' normalizations to occur. 6 Greg's conclusion is that for the "accidentals" of a text—spelling, punctuation, and capitalization—the earliest edition set from an authoritative manuscript should be chosen as copy-text, with the insertion of such "substantive" or other alterations from the revised editions which in the judgment of the editor are authoritative. This procedure, which is coming to be pretty generally recognized in studies of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, seems particularly relevant to an inquiry into the text of such a work as the Spectator, printed first in Folio sheets and later revised for publication in book form. Through the greater part of Volume I (Nos. 1-80) the 8vo and 12mo texts of the Spectator are quite similar. In numbers 12, 13, and 19 the two texts are identical so far as accidentals are concerned, and this is generally true through No. 73, with the 12mo copying typographical errors of 8vo in numbers 15 and 28. There seems little question but that for most of the volume the copy-text used by 12mo is the printed 8vo sheets. For the last seven numbers, however, there is considerable divergence, with 12mo following in about equal proportions Folio and 8vo readings, and in No. 80 copying an error in Folio. For Nos. 74-80, therefore, we may conclude that the 12mo text is less insignificant than it appears to be in the earlier and greater part of the volume. In Volume II (Nos. 81-169) the pattern is much the same as in the first part of Volume I, with the 12mo text closely following the 8vo. A substantive revision, however, appears as early as No. 91, and others follow in Nos. 101, 104, 110, 119, 125, 131 (as many as seven in this number), and so on, in increasing numbers in the latter half of the volume. The 12mo text shows little similarity to the Folio throughout Volume II, and there is no instance of its copying errors in the Folio text. It does reproduce errors, however, from the 8vo, so that one must conclude that its copy was the 8vo sheets. The increasing number of revisions, on the other hand, suggests that the authors may have taken the opportunity to make further corrections after the 8vo sheets had been printed. The 8vo and 12mo texts diverge radically in Volume III (Nos. 170-251), with the 8vo retaining many of the Folio characteristics and the 12mo showing for the most part independent readings, so far as accidentals are concerned. In No. 221 the 8vo text follows the Folio in every detail, whereas there are 38 changes in 12mo. In only four (Nos. 170, 178, 184, and 251) of the eighty-two papers in this volume is the agreement between 8vo and 12mo greater than that between Folio and 8vo. The 8vo copies errors of the Folio in Nos. 202, 212, 223, 228, 234, 241, and 249; in only one instance (No. 242) is an error in Folio copied by 12mo. The 12mo text shows a similar independence as regards substantive readings and in as many as twenty-seven essays contains authorial revisions not to be found in 8vo. Significantly it is only in this volume that we find an instance of an erratum marked in the Folio and corrected in only one of the reprints. In No. 235 the substitution of "Fence" for "Force" is noted only in the 12mo. It can hardly be argued, on the other hand, that the 8vo is following an uncorrected copy of Folio, for a considerable share of substantive revisions are to be found in both 8vo and 12mo. These often occur in slightly different form, so that one infers that both reprints are using independently a corrected Folio sheet. One example may be given (from No. 249): FOLIO For this Reason likewise Venus has gained the Title of the Laughter-loving Dame, as Waller has Translated it, and is represented by Horace as the Goddess who delights in Laughter. Milton, in a Joyous Assembly of imaginary Persons, has given us a very poetical Figure of Laughter. His whole Band of Mirth is so finely described that I shall set it down at length. 8vo For this Reason likewise Venus has gained the Title of ( h ιλο——είδη ζ) the Laughter-loving Dame, as Waller has translated it, and is represented by Horace as the Goddess who delights in Laughter. Milton, in a joyous Assembly of imaginary Persons, has given us a very poetical Figure of Laughter. His whole Band of Mirth is so finely described that I shall set down the Passage at length. 12mo For this Reason likewise Venus has gained the Title of h ιλο——είδηζ the Laughter-loving Dame, as Waller has translated it, and is represented by Horace as the Goddess who delights in Laughter. Milton, in a joyous Assembly of imaginary Persons, has given us a very poetical Figure of Laughter. His whole Band of Mirth is so finely described, that I shall set the Passage down at length. In Volume IV (Nos. 252-321) the normal pattern of concurrence between 8vo and 12mo is resumed, but only as far as No. 270. Beginning with No. 271 the 12mo text suddenly begins to show a preponderance of identical readings, both accidentals and substantives, with Folio. More precisely, the shift occurs not at the end of No. 270, but about midway in the fourth paragraph of No. 271, at the conclusion of gathering H of the 8vo edition. From the beginning of gathering I of the 8vo to the end of the volume the 12mo text, especially as far as accidentals are concerned, is much closer to the Folio than to the 8vo. In No. 305, a fair example, the 12mo agrees with the 8vo in five cases, with the Folio in sixty-one. It seems likely that the printing of 12mo was proceeding at a faster pace than that of 8vo and that the supply of 8vo printed sheets, which the 12mo compositor had been using for copy, were no longer available, so that from No. 271 the Folio sheets became the copy for 12mo. As we should expect, 12mo copies errors from 8vo in the early part of the volume (in Nos. 265, 266, and 270), and after No. 270 copies errors from Folio (in Nos. 272, 278, and 285). Near the end of the volume, however (in No. 319), it repeats an error from 8vo, in the spelling "disigenuous," which, unless due to coincidence, suggests the following of 8vo. 7 The dependence of 12mo on Folio need not in itself, however, imply an inferior state of text for 12mo; in several of the papers in the latter portion of the volume (notably in Nos. 272, 275, 279, 285, 298, 309, and 317) it preserves correct substantive readings which had been lost in the 8vo. On the other hand, the correction of errata in two numbers falling in the latter half of Volume IV seems to point to further revision induced by "second thoughts" in the preparation of 8vo. The erratum for No. 283 has " for Catlaine's read Cataline's." The 12mo text duly prints "Cataline's," but the 8vo has the correct spelling "Catiline's." In No. 293 we have the case of two errata originally marked in the Folio sheet but apparently superseded by further revision before the number came to be reprinted. FOLIO Queen Elizabeth, instead of looking upon this as a Diminution of her Honour, valued her self upon such a signal Favour of Providence; and accordingly in the Reverse of the Medal above-mentioned, a Fleet beaten by a Tempest, and falling foul upon one another. . . (Erratum: " after accordingly, r. you see.") 8vo . . . and accordingly in the Reverse of the Medal above mentioned, has represented a Fleet beaten by a Tempest. . . 12mo . . . and accordingly in the Reverse of the Medal above-mention'd, has represented a Fleet beaten by a Tempest. . . FOLIO Alas! What an insignificant Creature am I in this prodigious Ocean of Waters; my Existence is of no significancy to the Universe. . . (Erratum: for insignificant, r. inconsiderable.") 8vo Alass! What an insignificant Creature am I in this prodigious Ocean of Waters; my Existence is of no Concern to the Universe. . . 12mo Alas! What an inconsiderable Creature am I in this prodigious Ocean of Waters; my Existence is of no Concern to the Universe. . . If we were confronted with only the second of these cases we might infer that 12mo was using an uncorrected Folio sheet and had only the original errata notice to follow. In the first example, however, both 12mo and 8vo adopt the same revision, and consequently it would appear either that the 12mo compositor was careless or that he had access to only a partially revised sheet. The entire 12mo text of this number is very close to the Folio in accidentals, and, in contrast to 8vo, fails to correct the spelling "Richlieu" earlier in the paper as well as the incorrect marking of the Greek motto at the head of the essay. Clearly, the 12mo readings in the latter half of Volume IV, standing so close as they do, both in accidentals and substantives, to the Folio, afford a valuable check on the 8vo text, but they offer no easy solution and do not allow an editor to shirk the responsibility of deciding each reading on its own merits. For the first part of Volume V (Nos. 322-394) the 12mo text continues to show considerable dependence on the Folio sheets, and copies errors from the Folio in No. 326; but after No. 351 the similarity between the two decreases, with the exception of one number (No. 386), and from No. 352 to the end of the volume the 8vo and 12mo texts are in general agreement. Errors in 8vo are copied by 12mo in Nos. 354, 359, 361, and 369. Both 8vo and 12mo of this volume were published simultaneously, and it seems likely that at the beginning each volume was set up from corrected Folio sheets, but that after some thirty numbers had been printed the supply of 8vo sheets began to be available as copy for 12mo. There is a notable absence of independent substantive readings in 12mo. Volume V was produced, both in 8vo and 12mo, by Buckley, and the proportion of variants is high, particularly in the papers originally printed in Folio by Tonson. It is perhaps worth noting that in the Milton papers, most of which occur before No. 352, the instances in which 12mo follows Folio rather than 8vo are to be found mainly in the quoted passages. Was the 8vo compositor using a separately marked copy of Paradise Lost and the 12mo compositor simply transcribing the Folio sheets? Volume VI (Nos. 395-473) is notable for the low number of accidental variants, and there is a greater uniformity among the three texts than in any of the other volumes. In No. 413 there are only seven variants, a proportion of only 4% to the length of the paper. This is an extreme case, but in only eleven numbers of this volume does the proportion rise above 20%, in remarkable contrast to Volume V, in which all but two of the papers show a figure higher than 20%. Generally the 8vo and 12mo texts agree; only in three numbers (Nos. 411, 439, and 468) is there a greater correspondence between 12mo and Folio. Judging from the reproduction of errors, the 12mo text seems to follow now the 8vo (in Nos. 400, 403, 422, 425, 427, 450, 465, and 470), now the Folio (in Nos. 407, 413, 436, and 458) as copy. Independent substantive readings are rare in the 12mo, but as usual it frequently preserves correct readings from the Folio. The proportion of variants in Volume VII (Nos. 474-555) is higher, particularly in the first half of the volume. It is apparent from typographical evidence that this volume, both in 8vo and 12mo, was divided between the two printing houses, Buckley producing the first half of the volume (Nos. 474-517)—through gathering Q in the 8vo and gathering H in the 12mo—and Tonson doing the remainder. 8 In the portion printed by Buckley there is considerable variation between 8vo and 12mo; in the remainder of the volume the 12mo text follows 8vo fairly consistently. The most striking feature is the fact that in the first half of Volume VII the proportion of variants is much higher (an average of 36% per number) in the papers which Tonson had originally printed in Folio than in the papers originally produced by Buckley himself (an average of 21%). Conversely, in the latter half of the volume the average of variants for the papers originally printed by Tonson is only 12%, whereas the average for those originally brought out by Buckley is 17%. These figures, which can be supplemented by comparisons from other volumes, afford good evidence that changes in accidentals are likely to be due not to the authors of the essays but to the practice of printers. This survey of the textual variants in the seven volumes enables us to see more clearly the relationship of the three texts. It is apparent that for a large portion of the essays the 12mo text is following the reprinted 8vo sheets. This is true in the main for Volumes I, V, and VI, where 12mo generally reproduces the text of 8vo quite closely. These portions of the Spectator are less likely to offer, in the 12mo volumes, independent and revised readings. The remaining four volumes, particularly Volume III, display radical divergences in the 12mo text, and are entitled to more scrutiny than they have hitherto been accorded. The differences may be summarized by showing for each volume the number of essays in which independent 12mo readings are more numerous than agreement of 12mo with either 8vo or Folio. Variants I II III IV V VI VII Accidentals 3 27 79 8 0 1 11 Substantives 0 8 34 13 0 5 11 Since the 12mo text has been almost completely ignored in the past, it is obvious that for certain volumes it may offer the opportunity for new and good readings. The point raised by the study of variants in Volume VII offers the possibility of exploring the real cause for accidental variants. From the evidence supplied there, it would seem likely that we should find fewer variants of this sort in a number of the Spectator produced by the same printing-house in Folio, 8vo, and 12mo, than in a number brought out in Folio by Printer A and reproduced in 8vo and 12mo by Printer B. Three other volumes of the Spectator enable us to test this hypothesis—I and VI, printed both in 8vo and 12mo by Tonson, and V, printed in both 8vo and 12mo by Buckley. A count of the accidental variants—excluding the substantive changes, for which the author, not the compositor, would be responsible—shows conclusively that an essay originally produced by one printer and reprinted by another contains a greater number of variants. In Volume I (published in 8vo and 12mo by Tonson) the number of accidental variants in the 40 essays which Tonson had originally printed in Folio is 1,123; for the same number of essays first printed by Buckley the total is 1,287, an increase of 12½%. In Volume V (by Buckley) the variants in the 36 essays originally printed by Buckley total 1,551; the variants in the same number of essays first printed by Tonson total 2,410, an increase of over 35%. The Tonson papers in this volume are considerably longer, with a total "lineage" almost 25% greater than that of the Buckley papers. Even with this modification, however, the increase is sufficiently impressive. In Volume VI (by Tonson) the 39 papers originally done by Tonson show a total of 501 variants; in the same number of original Buckley papers the total reaches 996, an increase of almost 50%. The total length of the Buckley papers in this volume is only 9% greater than that of the Tonson papers. The variants when classified according to the authors of the essays do not show the same consistent proportions. It is the printer who is responsible. Variants in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization exist not because the author of the essay demanded these changes but because the preferences of the compositor or the practice of the printing-house dictated a different spelling, a heavier or lighter punctuation, or a more consistent system of capitalization. The evidence from spelling is conclusive. In the dedication of Volume II to Lord Halifax the first edition of the 12mo (Sig.A2 v ) reads: "While I busie my self as a Stranger upon Earth, and can pretend to no other than being a Looker-on, You are conspicuous in the Busie and Polite World. . . ." In the second edition the spellings "busy" and "Busy" are substituted—not because Steele rewrote the dedication, but because the first edition was produced by Tonson, the second by Buckley. A more arresting example occurs in two of the Folio Spectators (Nos. 170 and 171), both written by the same author (Addison) on the theme of jealousy but printed by Buckley and Tonson respectively. In the first essay "jealousy" is spelled without exception (twelve times) with the "y" ending, and in the following paper as regularly and uniformly (six times) with the "ie" termination. It is unthinkable that Addison wilfully altered the spelling of the key word in the two essays, spelling it "jealousy" throughout the one and "jealousie" throughout the other. When Tonson reprinted these essays in the 8vo edition, the spelling throughout both numbers is "jealousie," whereas the 12mo edition of Buckley with almost equal uniformity (there are two exceptions) spells the word "jealousy." The responsibility for the changes is unmistakable. The letters of Addison and Steele exhibit the greatest irregularity in spelling, 9 and one conjectures that the Spectator manuscripts confronting the compositor showed a similar lack of consistency. Since the Spectator was produced by two printing-houses, both in the original printing and in the 8vo and 12mo volumes, it offers a particularly good source for evidence of spelling differences. The two spellings of "busy" have been cited. In the Folio sheets printed by Tonson the word is generally spelled "busie," but it is never spelled thus in the Folio numbers printed by Buckley. In the Folio, again, the word "battle" appears uniformly thus in numbers by Buckley, and without exception as "battel" in numbers by Tonson. The table below brings together the most clearly marked differences in spelling, in the Folio sheets, the 8vo, and the 12mo edition. The first column lists all the occurrences of each spelling in the 555 Folio numbers, first in the papers printed by Tonson and secondly in those printed by Buckley. In the seven columns following will be found the corresponding spellings of each word in the seven volumes of the reprint, first in 8vo and then in 12mo. Volume VII is divided, to show (a) the portion (Nos. 474-517) printed by Buckley and (b) the portion (Nos. 518-555) printed by Tonson. At the foot, for each of the 8vo and 12mo volumes, will be found the total of characteristic "Buckley" and "Tonson" spellings.

The word "money," for example, which is never spelled as "mony" in the Folio sheets printed by Buckley, has this spelling in both formats of Volume I and Volume VI and is never spelled thus in Volume V, 8vo. Some of the spellings—particularly the "ie" and "our" endings—may of course in some cases be due to the need for justifying the line of type, and due allowance must be made for accident or error on the part of the compositor. Most of the differences, however, occur in sufficient numbers and with enough consistency to rule out the element of chance. A comparison of the spellings in the Folio sheets with those in the following columns points very strongly to the printers responsible for the 8vo and 12mo volumes: the 8vo volumes I, III, and VI, and the 12mo volumes I, II, IV, and VI by Tonson; the 8vo volumes II and IV, and the 12mo volumes III and V by Buckley; with Volume VII, both in 8vo and 12mo, clearly divided between the two. Only for Volume V, 8vo, is the evidence inconclusive, and on the basis of typography it may be assigned to Buckley. For all the other volumes the typographical evidence confirms the data from spelling differences, and the several volumes may provisionally be assigned as follows: OCTAVO DUODECIMO I. Tonson Tonson II. Buckley Tonson III. Tonson Buckley IV. Buckley Tonson V. Buckley Buckley VI. Tonson Tonson VII. (a) Buckley Buckley (b) Tonson Tonson Our concern here, however, is not so much to prove the identity of the printers responsible as to note the remarkable consistency of spelling differences and the very strong support which this gives to the hypothesis that these differences are attributable not to the authors of the essays but to the compositor or the printing-house. And what is true of spelling is, I feel sure, also true of other accidentals such as capitalization, punctuation, italicizing, abbreviating, and so on. The Spectator was published at a time when these matters were in process of becoming standardized, but there was still considerable latitude. McKerrow has pointed out how different, in the matter of capitalization, is Rowe's text of Shakespeare, printed in 1709, from that of Pope, published just sixteen years later: In one respect Rowe's text appears to-day more old-fashioned than the Fourth Folio, for he, or his printer, introduced the practice common in his time of capitalizing almost all nouns. Pope's text, on the other hand, though printed from Rowe's, has hardly more capitals than a modern edition. 10 If sufficient manuscript material by Addison and the other authors of the essays existed it might be possible to attempt to determine the general practice of these authors and proceed to standardize spelling and other accidentals accordingly. Such material is not available, and any attempt to regularize the Spectator essays to fit such a program is open to the two-fold objection that it would necessarily be incomplete and that it would impose a far greater uniformity in such matters than Steele or Addison or any of the other contributors ever cared about or practised. A choice among copy-texts, however, must be made, even though such a text will certainly exhibit a number of non-authorial characteristics. The evidence assembled here gives very strong support to Greg's view that the first printing—in the case of the Spectator the Folio sheets—will be freest from contamination and the closest in the presentation of accidentals which we can hope to reach to the original intentions of the authors. The later corrections and changes which were made by the authors—substantive revisions—will then be incorporated into this basic text. In the Spectator these revisions may be said to begin with the lists of errata in the Folio sheets. As early as the sixth paper an errata list is provided for No. 5, and these occur at intervals throughout the run of the Spectator —a total of 57 errata lists in the 555 numbers, distributed among 38 numbers by Addison, 17 by Steele, one (No. 283) by Budgell, and one (No. 237) of uncertain authorship. Some of these errata have to do with improvements in style, some are corrections of fact, and some are simply rectifications of spelling. Many factual errors and misspellings remain unnoticed, however, so that it is clear that the insertion of errata lists was not done in any very systematic manner. The greater part of them have to do with the Milton papers, and in the later numbers of the Spectator the occurrence of errata lists diminishes perceptibly. The errata are, with some exceptions, taken into account with the reprinting of the essays in 8vo and 12mo. In addition, many stylistic changes are made—a total of over 1,500. They are unmistakably author revisions. Addison, for instance, makes a number of stylistic alterations to avoid inadvertent repetition of a word, and with fairly regular consistency he drops the relative pronoun "that" and replaces it by "which" or "who." Addison, in fact, pays much more attention to such matters than does Steele and is responsible for more than two-thirds of the total number of revisions. Of the 555 papers only 51, less than one-tenth, are without any stylistic changes; of these 33 are papers by Steele, 14 by Addison, two by Budgell, and two by uncertain authors. Moreover, the number of such revisions in single papers is much higher in Addison's than in Steele's; Addison's papers will contain as many as twelve or fifteen stylistic revisions within an essay. Steele's revisions run to a lower figure: there are a few papers with as many as seven, but the number is generally lower. Only 41 of Steele's papers contain more than three such revisions. Steele's inattention may be illustrated by the manner in which he allows reproduction of his own earlier writings to stand in the Spectator . On two occasions he quotes long extracts from The Christian Hero , in texts which are palpably careless and inexact. The phrase "the Machiavilian Scheme" appears in No. 516, Folio, as "the Machiavilian Scene," an error which is allowed to stand in the 8vo and 12mo texts. Again, the phrase "Their proud and disdainful Hearts, which were putrified with the Love and Pride of this World" appears in No. 356 (all three texts) with the reading "petrifyed." One might argue that this change was Steele's own revision but for the fact that he continues to use "putrified" in editions of The Christian Hero after 1712. When Steele and Addison make stylistic revisions for the 8vo and 12mo editions, and when we can be sure that the changes are in fact revisions, we are entitled to consider them as representing what the authors of the Spectator intended us to read. Too often in the past, however, editors have been ready to take all such readings in the 8vo text as authoritative revisions. Actually many are printers' errors. For example, in No. 267, the first of the Paradise Lost papers, an essay which Addison carefully revised, the 8vo and 12mo texts read: As on the contrary, no single Step should be omitted in that just and regular Process which it must be supposed to take from its Original to its Consummation. If we turn to the Folio text we see that what Addison wrote was "that just and regular Progress," and this is confirmed by the reading in the 1719 volume of the Paradise Lost essays. The Tickell edition of the Works repeats the erroneous "Process," as do most modern editions, including those of Aitken and Gregory Smith. Morley alone looked at the Folio and has the correct reading. A few additional examples may be cited in which the Folio text is to be preferred. FOLIO 8vo and 12mo No. 94: he distinguishes every Moment of it with some useful or amusing Thought with useful or amusing Thought No. 164: that he might encourage her in the pious Resolution she had taken, and give her suitable Exhortations for her Behaviour in it the pious Resolutions No. 295: there should not have been a Woman in the County better dressed in the Country No. 342: it was in the Woman he had chosen that a Man of Sense could shew Pride or Vanity with any Excuse with an Excuse No. 361: It has often supplied the place of the ancient Chorus, in the Works of Mr. *** in the Words of No. 455: I was naturally led into a Reflection upon the Advantages of Education, or moral Culture modern Culture No. 478: Old Beaus are to be preferr'd in the first Place to be presented Another interesting—and much larger—body of examples occurs in which the correct reading of the Folio text has been lost in the 8vo reprint but retained in the 12mo version. This edition, inferior in appearance to the handsome subscription 8vo, has been almost entirely ignored in the past. The fact is, however, that while it introduces errors of its own, it frequently provides, as we have seen, evidence of being independently set up from the corrected Folio sheets, and it avoids many of the errors of the 8vo edition. In No. 290, by Steele, the 8vo text reads: We have seldom had any Female Distress on the Stage, which did not, upon cool Imagination, appear to flow from the Weakness rather than the Misfortune of the Person represented. It would not be difficult to conjecture that for "Imagination" we should read "Examination," and this is, in fact, the reading of both the Folio and 12mo texts. Both Aitken and Gregory Smith retain the 8vo reading. In No. 533, again by Steele, which contains a letter protesting against immoral company in stage-coaches, the 8vo text reads: One of them was called a Captain, and entertained us with nothing but silly stupid Questions, or lewd Songs, all the Way. Turning to the Folio text, we find that the reading is not "silly" but "filthy stupid Questions." The 8vo compositor misread the word, but the 12mo compositor got it right and printed it as it stood in the Folio. All succeeding editors have followed the erroneous 8vo text. I cite a few more examples in which the 8vo text is clearly wrong. FOLIO and 12mo 8vo No. 113: I made new Liveries, new paired my Coach-Horses, sent them all to Town to be bitted, and taught to throw their Legs well, and move all together and move altogether No. 210: If he considers his Being as circumscribed by the uncertain Term of a few Years, his Designs will be contracted into the same narrow Span he imagines is to bound his Existence. to bound to his Existence. No. 224: as it inspires rational Ambitions, correct Love, and elegant Desires. rational Ambition, corrects Love, and elegant Desire. No. 250: since the several Treatises of Thumbs, Ears and Noses have obliged the World, this of Eyes is at your Service. the several Treaties No. 264: The Hogsheads of Neat Port came safe, and have gotten thee good Reputation in these Parts the good Reputation No. 298: They would face me down, that all Women of good Sense ever were, and ever will be, Latitudinarians in Wedlock and always did, and will, give and take what they profanely term conjugal Liberty of Conscience. profusely term No. 448: the Expectation which is raised by impertinent Promisers Promises No. 456: these Men are to be valued only for their Mortality, and as we hope better Things from their Heirs Morality No. 521 (on lies and distortions of fact): These and many other Hints I could suggest to you for the Elucidation of all Fictions Factions A study of these examples suggests that the Folio text not only in accidentals but in substantive readings possesses more authority than has generally been recognized, and that, although it was revised when the Spectator was reprinted in book form, the compositors of the 8vo and 12mo versions—particularly of the 8vo—altered the text in many cases for the worse. Interestingly enough, in view of the fact that earlier editorial collation seems to have centered largely on the early papers, the errors increase in number in the later volumes: in the first two volumes I find only 17 instances of erroneous substitution in the 8vo, but there are 57 in Volumes III and IV, and 107 in Volumes V, VI, and VII. With the publication of the Spectator in book form these errors became firmly incorporated in the text, and no one, with the partial exception of Morley, seems to have looked at the Folio readings from this point of view or attempted a serious collation of the three texts. If the Folio text thus merits attention, an examination of the 12mo edition shows that it also needs to be taken into account as a source of substantive readings. While it introduces many obvious errors, it provides some examples of independent stylistic revisions, with readings, consequently, which are not to be found in the Folio or 8vo edition. In Volumes I and II there is not much difference textually between the 8vo and 12mo editions, although in Volume II the 12mo begins to diverge noticeably. In Volume III there are radical differences (a preponderance of differences in 79 out of the 82 numbers in the volume). In Volume IV the differences are much less striking, and in Volumes V-VII they become almost negligible. To put it another way, in the first two volumes there are eight readings which appear to be authorial revisions distinct from the Folio and 8vo versions; in Volumes III and IV there are 47; whereas in Volumes V-VII there are no more than 16. Three examples may be cited. In No. 131 the Folio text, followed by the 8vo, reads: "Some look upon me as very proud, and some as very melancholy." The 12mo version looks like an author's revision: "Some look upon me as very proud, some as very modest, and some as very melancholy." In No. 195, in a paragraph on the long-lived Lewis Cornaro, the Folio text reads: insomuch that at fourscore he Published his Book, which has been translated into English under the Title of The sure way of attaining a long and healthful Life . The 8vo text follows this reading, and Gregory Smith has the following note upon the passage: "The English version incorrectly referred to by Addison is Sure and certain Methods of attaining a long and healthful Life . . ." The 12mo edition, however, contains the correct reading: insomuch that at fourscore he published his Book, which has been translated into English under the Title of sure and certain Methods of attaining a long and healthful Life . The third example to be offered involves a drastic change in meaning. In No. 279, one of the Paradise Lost essays, in a passage in which Addison is discussing the sublimity of Milton's thoughts, the Folio text reads: It is impossible for the Imagination of Man to distend it self with greater Ideas, than those which he has laid together in his first and sixth Book. Addison revised this sentence, striking out, I assume, in the Folio sheet the last three words and inserting in the margin, "second and sixth Books." The 8vo compositor noted the correction but apparently misread the word "sixth," so that in the 8vo edition the sentence ends with the words "in his first, second, and tenth Books." Only the 12mo text has the correct reading, "in his first, second and sixth Books." The 12mo reading not only accords better with the facts of Milton's poem but is confirmed by the 1719 reprint of the Paradise Lost papers. Such are some of the substantive differences in the three early texts. They emphasize unmistakably the dangers inherent in too implicit a reliance upon the 8vo text, the edition which has hitherto served almost exclusively as the source for modern reprints of the Spectator . Studied in connection with the accidental variants they enable us to assess with greater confidence the relative authority of the various portions of the text and to see at first hand some of the processes of change, degeneration, and recovery which operate in the reprintings of a long prose work. The study of variant spellings and conflicting readings not only allows us to restore much that has been lost but also brings some evidence to bear on the responsibility which the printing-house may claim in the texts which we now read. Judged from this point of view the study of variants may escape the censure which the writer of Spectator 470 bestowed upon the textual critics of his own day: Indeed, when a different Reading gives us a different Sense, or a new Elegance in an Author, the Editor does very well in taking Notice of it; but when he only entertains us with the several ways of Spelling the same Word, and gathers together the various Blunders and Mistakes of twenty or thirty different Transcribers, they only take up the Time of the learned Reader, and puzzle the Minds of the Ignorant. His own prose, which has enjoyed the praise of Dr. Johnson and survived the censure of Bishop Hurd, deserves to be read in as accurate a version as modern scholarship can attain. Such a text, if not imparting "a new Elegance," will at least in many cases allow "a different Sense,"—a sense, one hopes, which its author originally intended and would now approve.</field>

When he prints (No. 262, third paragraph) "any thing that favours of party" it is not difficult to conjecture that the text should read "savours" or (No. 432, fourth paragraph) that "the Thrift of Glory" should be "the Thirst of Glory." Others can only be discovered by collation. 3 For full discussion see Bond, "The First Printing of the Spectator ," MP, XLVII (1950), 164-177. 4 It is clear, however, that by 27 November, at latest, Volumes III and IV had been published in 8vo. In No. 547, published on this date, Addison prints a complimentary letter praising particular essays in "those two Volumes which you have lately Published." "The Lady where we visited," the correspondent (Addison himself?) writes, "having the two last Volumes in large Paper interleafed for her own private use, ordered them to be brought down, and laid in the Window, whither every one in the Company retired, and writ down a particular Advertisement in the Stile and Phrase of the like Ingenious Compositions which we frequently meet with at the end of our News Papers." The references are all to essays in Volume III, and Addison concludes: "Not having room to insert all the Advertisements which were sent me, I have only picked out some few from the Third Volume, reserving the Fourth for another Opportunity." 5 Advertisements in the Guardian and the Daily Courant cited by Miss Blanchard in her edition of Steele's Correspondence (1941), p. 461. 6 "The Rationale of Copy-text," Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 19-36. 7 To be noted also are two errors in the index to this volume which are carried over from 8vo to 12mo: "Abigals (made)" for "Abigails (male)" and "Canietia" for "Canidia." These of course do not affect the relationship of 12mo to Folio. 8 Cf. William B.

      <field name="heading_text">The Preface to A Dictionary of the English Language : Johnson's Revision and the Establishment of the Text by W. R. Keast</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several studies of Johnson's revisions of his publications have disposed of the old belief that his care for his writings ceased when they originally left his pen. The interest of these studies has been chiefly in enabling us to see the process by which the final form of each text—the form in which we are familiar with it—was attained; only rarely has a knowledge of Johnson's revisions enabled editors to arrive at readings superior to those in the traditional texts. 1 Johnson's revisions of his Preface to the Dictionary of the English Language present a more complex and instructive case. While noteworthy, like his other revisions, in displaying a great stylist at work, these revisions have an additional significance for the establishment of the true text of the Preface. For Johnson revised the Preface twice, making an independent set of alterations each time. And only one of these sets of revisions has been incorporated in the versions of the Preface printed since the eighteenth century. Four folio editions of the Dictionary appeared during Johnson's lifetime. The first edition was published in 1775; the second closely followed, the first volume late in 1775 and the second early in 1756; the third edition was published in 1765; and the fourth in 1773. All the subsequent texts of the Preface contain variations from the first edition both in such "accidentals" as spelling and punctuation, and in "substantive" readings directly affecting the sense. It is the purpose of this study to record these variations; to indicate, on the basis of them, the relations among the several editions; to distinguish, so far as possible, between those variant readings which should be attributed to Johnson and those which should be attributed to the compositor or proof-corrector; and to suggest the editorial principles on which future editions of the Preface should be based.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Second Folio Edition, 1755-56 The second edition departs from the first in 31 readings, of which 15 are in the accidentals of the text and 16 affect its substance. The accidental variants may be considered first, for they are not of great importance, and there is no clear sign that Johnson is responsible for any of them. Spelling: 6 changes: 2 (2) pionier to pioneer pioneer is the spelling in the Dictionary , where Johnson gives pionier as the French form. (2) recompense to recompence recompence is the spelling in the Dictionary , and cf. expence (20), licence (68), (90), chace (72). (48) synonimous to synonymous synonymous is the spelling in the Dictionary; but cf. synonimes (43) in all editions. (67) though to tho' both forms are given in the Dictionary . (74) subtle to subtile although both forms are given in the Dictionary, subtle is noted as the spelling commonly used for the sense of cunning , which is not the meaning here. Elsewhere in the Preface subtle appears at (44), but subtile at (85) and subtilty at (69). (81) unreguarded to unregarded the first edition spelling is incorrect. Punctuation: 7 changes: (4) purity; to purity, the first edition punctuation is clearly correct. (20) importance to importance, an indifferent change; precedents for either reading can be found elsewhere in the Preface, although in general Johnson prefers a heavier punctuation. (29) dictionary, to dictionary the 2d edition reading is more "modern," and may be defended by analogy with a comparable phrase in (72); but the first edition's comma is the less obvious punctuation, and Johnson often encloses with commas, even when this is not necessary to mark the syntax, phrases to which he wants to give special prominence; cf. the last two sentences of (19). (55) CHEER to CHEER, this change corrects an error in the first edition. (56) examples, to examples perhaps indifferent; but the comma makes the syntax clearer and is more consistent with Johnson's heavy punctuation. Cf. the last sentence of (63). (89) both, to both; indifferent; precedents for both punctuations can be found in the Preface. (94) Beni , to Beni ; this change corrects an error in the first edition. Capitalization: I change: (20) but to But this is probably not Johnson's change, for he often began the answer to a question with a lower-case letter. Cf. (91), where a similar normalization was introduced in the fourth edition; and cf. also the lower-case letter to begin the second of a series of two questions in (88). Typographical style: I change: (40) to break to to break this change corrects an error in the first edition. Four of these changes —those in (81), (55), (94), and (40)—are simple corrections of errors in the first edition. All the errors are obvious, and the corrections merely bring the readings into conformity with the style of the remainder of the text. All could have been easily made by a careful compositor or an alert press-corrector, and the general excellence of the work on this edition suggests that the compositors were careful and the proof-correctors alert, for although these four errors were corrected, no new errors were introduced. I do not think, therefore, that these four changes need be attributed to Johnson. Most of the remaining 11 changes are normalizations or easier readings. None seems clearly to be by Johnson, and in view of the relatively small number of substantive changes he made in the text for this edition, it is perhaps doubtful that his care extended to details of spelling and punctuation. I should be inclined to attribute these 11 changes in accidentals, therefore, to the compositor. There are 16 substantive changes in the second-edition text. (11) The first edition reads: Such defects are not errours in orthography, but spots of barbarity impressed so deep in the English language, that criticism can never wash them away; these, therefore, must be permitted to remain untouched: but many words have likewise been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance, as the pronunciation of the vulgar has been weakly followed; . . . . In the second edition the latter portion reads: . . . but many words have been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance, . . . . The omission of likewise may be a compositor's error, for it is easier to omit a word than to insert one. But I think this is Johnson's change, made because he saw that likewise was not quite accurate: alterations of the language from accident and depravations from ignorance are errors , and hence are not produced in a manner like that which accounts for the spots of barbarity referred to first. likewise , furthermore, dulls the antithesis, and weakens Johnson's charge that preventable damage is done by accidental or ignorant alteration. (15) The first edition reads: I have left, in the examples, to every authour his own practice unmolested, that the reader may balance suffrages, and judge between us: . . . . In the second edition the next word to the last is altered to betwixt . In view of the care with which the compositor followed his copy in setting this edition, I doubt that he would have made so unnecessary a change, although it is not beyond belief. On the other hand, I do not see why Johnson should have made it. But on balance it should probably be attributed to him. (38) The first edition reads: As composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a language, I have endeavoured to make some reparation for the universal negligence of my predecessors, by inserting great numbers of compounded words, as may be found under after, fore, new, night, fair , and many more. The second edition text omits fair from this list. This is surely Johnson's change. In defining after, fore, new , and night in the Dictionary , he calls attention to the use of each in composition and gives numerous examples— 38 passages exemplifying compounds with new , some 30 compounds of night , 27 with after , and 73 with fore . But in defining fair he says nothing of its use as a compounding element, and he gives no compound words formed from it. We may speculate on the sequence of events underlying the inclusion of fair in the first edition. Johnson may have included it by mistake, although this is unlikely on the face of it, and the more so because the first four words in the list are in alphabetical order. It is most improbable that the compositor intruded a word. The likeliest explanation is that Johnson's manuscript contained a fifth example which the compositor misread as fair ; in his revisal Johnson recognized fair as incorrect, without being able to recall the word he had originally written or troubling to add another. We can only guess at what the original reading may have been. Perhaps it was semi , which would fall correctly in the alphabetical series, which is treated in the Dictionary as a prolific source of compounds, and which could have been misread as fair in Johnson's hand. 3 (38) The first edition reads: These [compound words], numerous as they are, might be multiplied, but that use and curiosity are here satisfied, and the frame of our language and modes of our combination amply discovered. In the second edition the last words read, with a sensible improvement of the rhythm, "modes of our combination are amply discovered." (39) The first edition reads: Of some forms of composition, such as that by which re is prefixed to note repetition , and un to signify contrariety or privation , all the examples cannot be accumulated, because the use of these particles, if not wholly arbitrary, is so little limited, that they are hourly affixed to new words as occasion requires, or is imagined to require them. But affixed is wrong, for it means "to unite to the end, or à posteriori ; to subjoin." Johnson therefore corrected the second edition text to united (having used prefixed earlier in the sentence, he did not want to repeat it). (40) The first edition reads: These [verbal phrases] I have noted with great care; and though I cannot flatter myself that the collection is complete, I believe I have so far assisted the students of our language, that this kind of phraseology will be no longer insuperable; . . . . In the second edition Johnson changed I believe I have to I have perhaps , possibly with a view to continuing more consistently the modest tone of the preceding clause. (41) The first edition reads: Many words yet stand supported only by the name of Bailey, Ainsworth, Philips , or the contracted Dict . for Dictionaries subjoined: of these I am not always certain that they are read in any book but the works of lexicographers. Of such I have omitted many, because I had never read them; . . . . The second edition reads: "of these I am not always certain that they are seen in any book but the works of lexicographers." I see no reason to attribute this change to the compositor. Johnson's alteration not only eliminates the rather awkward repetition of read , but distinguishes nicely between seeing a word in a dictionary and reading it in a book. (43) First edition: And such is the fate of hapless lexicography, that not only darkness, but light, impedes and distresses it; things may be not only too little, but too much known, to be happily illustrated. To explain, requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained, and such terms cannot always be found; for as nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known, and evident without proof, so nothing can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit a definition. In the second edition the final part of this passage reads: so nothing can be defined but by supposing some words too plain to admit a definition. I am not sure I can assay this change correctly; but I do not believe it is Johnson's. Johnson's point is not that definition forces us to suppose (what we might not otherwise know) that some words are too plain to be defined. This we already know ("such terms cannot always be found"). Instead, his point is that definition is impossible without the use of these words, which cannot themselves be defined. In the first edition the phrase the use of words stands directly below by supposing something , and I suspect that the second-edition compositor read the wrong line—the surrounding words are very similar—and carried by supposing some down into the next line as he set it. (45) The first edition reads: If of these [words of loose and general signification] the whole power is not accurately delivered, it must be remembered, that while our language is yet living, and variable by the caprice of every one that speaks it, these words are hourly shifting their relations, . . . . The second edition's "caprice of every tongue that speaks it" is an obvious improvement by Johnson. (78) The first edition reads: That many terms of art and manufacture are omitted, must be frankly acknowledged; but for this defect I may boldly allege that it was unavoidable: I could not visit caverns to learn the miner's language, nor take a voyage to perfect my skill in the dialect of navigation, nor visit the warehouses of merchants, and shops of artificers, to gain the names of wares, tools and operations, of which no mention is found in books; . . . . On re-reading this passage Johnson was perhaps struck by the repetition in warehouses: wares , or perhaps by the imperfect balance which results from illustrating the contents of warehouses with one word and of shops with two. Whatever the reason, he made the phraseology at once more elegant and more particular by substituting for wares the words commodities, utensils: "the warehouses of merchants, and shops of artificers, to gain the names of commodities, utensils, tools and operations, of which no mention is found in books." (85) The first edition reads: . . . the stile of Amelot's translation of father Paul is observed by Le Courayer to be un peu passè; . . . The error in accent may not have been Johnson's, but it was probably he who corrected the second-edition text to un peu passè . (89) The first edition reads: He that has long cultivated another language, will find its words and combinations croud upon his memory; and haste and negligence, refinement and affectation, will obtrude borrowed terms and exotick expressions. Johnson, perhaps to avoid repeating and four times in quick succession, altered this in the second edition to read: and haste or negligence, refinement or affectation, . . . (92) The first edition reads: In hope of giving longevity to that which its own nature forbids to be immortal, I have devoted this book, the labour of years, to the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm of philology to the nations of the continent. Perhaps this seemed too categorical, especially for the peroration. Johnson revised it to read: that we may no longer yield the palm of philology without a contest to the nations of the continent. As will be seen, Johnson again made this change when he revised the Preface for the 1773 edition. (93) The first edition reads: . . . some who distinguish desert . . . will consider . . . that sudden fits of inadvertency will surprize vigilance, slight avocations will seduce attention, and casual eclipses of the mind will darken learning; . . . In the second edition the words of the mind are omitted. I do not think Johnson made this change: it weakens the rhythm and obscures the meaning. The compositor accidentally dropped the phrase. (94) The first edition reads: If the lexicons of ancient tongues, now immutably fixed, and comprised in a few volumes, be yet, after the toil of successive ages, inadequate and delusive; if the aggregated knowledge, and co-operating diligence of the Italian academicians, did not secure them from the censure of Beni . . . I may surely be contented without the praise of perfection. . . . Johnson altered be yet to are yet in the second edition. It is true that Johnson notes in the Grammar of the English tongue that "the indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers frequently confounded," and that after if the conjunctive is used "among the purer writers." But he may have decided that the conjunctive did not suit well the mood of the verbs in the two succeeding if -clauses in this passage, and he may have chosen to sacrifice purity to a stronger suggestion that the lexicons of ancient tongues are inadequate. Of these 16 changes introduced in the second edition, two—those in (43) and (93)—are probably compositor's errors. The rest are probably by Johnson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. The Third Folio Edition, 1765 This text of the Preface has no independent textual authority. It is a page-for-page reprint of the second edition, and follows that edition in all the readings in which it departs from the first edition. The third edition introduces no new substantive readings. It departs from the second edition text in only 12 places: five of these are sporadic normalizations of spelling, three are slight changes in punctuation, of which one is indifferent and two obscure Johnson's syntax, and four are clear compositor's errors. 4 The third edition may therefore be disregarded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The Fourth Folio Edition, 1773 The fourth edition of the Preface is a page-for-page reprint of the first-edition text, varying from it in 38 readings, of which 21 are accidental and 17 substantive. Except for five of these readings, the text of the fourth edition does not repeat any of the variants introduced in the second-edition text nor any of the variants from the second edition introduced in the third. The five readings in which the second, third, and fourth editions agree against the first must therefore be examined in order to determine whether they imply dependence of the fourth-edition text on the second or third rather than, as the preponderance of the evidence would suggest, on the first. Four of the readings in which 1773 agrees with 1755-56 and 1765 are in accidentals: in (81) the correction of unreguarded to unregarded; in (55) the insertion of a necessary comma between to CHEER and its definition; in (94) substitution of a semicolon for a comma after Beni to separate the second and third of three long parallel clauses; and in (40) a correction in typographical style, changing an italic to to roman in the phrase "to break off " in conformity with the style in a list of examples. The fifth variant from the first-edition text in which the three later editions agree is a substantive change. In (92), as we have seen, Johnson originally said: In hope of giving longevity to hat which its own nature forbids to be immortal, I have devoted this book, the labour of years, to the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm of philology to the nations of the continent. In the second edition he had changed this to "that we may no longer yield the palm of philology without a contest to the nations of the continent"; this reading was repeated in 1765. The fourth edition reading is identical with the second, except that the phrase "without a contest" is set off with commas. Do these five readings establish a textual connection between the second edition and the fourth, or between the third and the fourth? I do not think they do. The four changes in accidentals are all simple corrections of manifest errors, of the kind that could easily have been made by any careful workman, guided by the consistent practice in the rest of the text, whether or not he had a corrected copy before him. As to the alteration in (94), I think we must suppose either that Johnson in 1773 remembered having made this change in 1755 (and he may have done so because this is the beginning of the noble close of the Preface), or that he invented it anew (which he might easily have done, for once the need for some softening of the sentence is felt, the phrase inserted has a degree of inevitability). If we suppose instead that Johnson derived this reading from the second or third-edition text, we must suppose what is almost inconceivable—that in all the other instances listed above in which these texts vary from the first edition Johnson rejected the reading of the intermediary text and returned by pure chance to the readings of the first edition. The agreement among the three later editions in these five places is to be attributed, therefore, not to a direct line of descent from one to another, but to the coincidence of simple and obvious corrections by compositors or proof-correctors (or, less likely, by Johnson) and to Johnson's chance recollection or repetition of one of his earlier revisions. The fourth-edition text is independently derived from the first edition. The remaining 33 variations between the texts of the first and fourth editions may now be examined. 5 17 affect the accidentals of the text. Spelling: 1 change: (6) registred to registered a random normalization, probably not by Johnson; cf. registered (31). Punctuation: 15 changes: (3) neglected, to neglected; (3) exuberance, to exuberance; (3) fashion, to fashion; these changes introduce heavier stops between long verb phrases in series, in accordance with the normal style of the Preface; cf. (1), (42), (62). They may be due to Johnson, but just as easily to a careful compositor or proofreader. (11) them away; to them away: (11) untouched: to untouched; these changes depart from Johnson's usual style. He regularly uses the colon, not only to introduce a series or an expansion, but to separate long complex clauses in which semicolons are used, or to separate clauses between which the connection is slight, where there is no conjunction and where we would normally use a period. Cf. for the first type, (4), (15), (17), (42), (51), (72), (86); for the second, (6), (17), (46), (48), (54), (65), (67), (92), (94). The colon is a heavier stop than the semicolon. In the sentence under consideration, the first ed. employs the two marks in the normal subordination; the fourth ed. reverses it. (16) been, perhaps, to been perhaps probably a printing-house change; Johnson usually encloses such parenthetical elements: cf. (18), (51), (61), (65), (88), (90). (21) and, though familiar to and though familiar probably a printing-house change; Johnson is usually careful to mark both ends of a qualifying element if he marks one. Cf. (28), (44). (31) fashion, or lust to fashion or lust probably a printing-house change. The pointing of the first edition text is at least consistent: ". . . words which our authours have introduced by their knowledge of foreign languages, or ignorance of their own, by vanity or wantonness, by compliance with fashion, or lust of innovation." If the comma is removed after fashion , that after languages should also be deleted. (Johnson uses no comma after vanity because it is not followed by a genitive phrase.) (41) Dictionaries subjoined: to Dictionaries subjoined; (42) grammatically considered: to grammatically considered; (45) settled meaning: to settled meaning; a little rash of normalizations like those in (II); the compositor or proof-reader did not understand Johnson's use of the colon. (65) those quotations which to those quotations, which although Johnson is not perfectly consistent in his punctuation of restrictive and non-restrictive clauses, the first edition pointing seems more in keeping with his usual style. (72) ransack, to ransack; a change perhaps occasioned by a substantive revision; see the list below. (87) but a little, above to but a little above the first edition is clearly correct. (94) I wished to please, have sunk to I wished to please have sunk perhaps indifferent, although Johnson usually prefers the heavier pointing. Capitalization: I change: (91) it remains to It remains Cf. the change made in the second edition at (20). Johnson seems to have been in the habit of beginning the answer to a question with a lower-case letter; this change is probably the compositor's. As in the second edition, the changes in accidentals seem to be the occasional intrusion of the compositor or proof-reader. Johnson's revision was casual and did not extend to the minutiae of the text. The text of the fourth edition contains 16 changes in the substantive readings of the first edition. Readers familiar with the Preface will recognize these, because they have been incorporated in the standard text; one or two of them, I think, should not be attributed to Johnson. (2) The first edition reads: Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries; whom mankind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of science, the pionier of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths of Learning and Genius, who press forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress. 1773: . . . doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory, . . . . (8) In 1755 Johnson writes that uncertain pronunciation is the source of that diversity of spelling observable in the Saxon remains, and I suppose in the first books of every nation, which perplexes or destroys analogy, and produces anomalous formations, which, being once incorporated, can never be afterward dismissed or reformed. In 1773 the final relative pronoun is changed: "anomalous formations, that, being once incorporated. . . ." Johnson's use of that and which in the Preface follows no principle consistently, and it is accordingly difficult to fix the responsibility for this change. But the printers seem in general to have followed their copy closely, and I suspect that Johnson changed the relative to eliminate the repetition of which , from which a false parallelism might be inferred. (15) Discussing the dependence of spelling on a writer's knowledge of the language from which English words are derived, Johnson concludes, in the first edition: . . . some words, such as dependant, dependent; dependance, dependence, vary their final syllable, as one or other language is present to the writer. The 1773 text reads: "as one or another language is present to the writer." I do not see the motive for this change, unless "one or other" seemed archaic in 1773; but again, in view of the infrequency of compositorial intervention, I think the change should be attributed to Johnson unless there is a clear reason for assigning it to the printer. (25) Defending himself against the charge of injustice to Junius as an etymologist, Johnson writes, in 1755: . . . it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness to charge that etymologist with want of judgment, who can seriously derive dream from drama, because life is a drama, and a drama is a dream; and who declares with a tone of defiance, that no man can fail to derive moan from μόνοζ, monos, who considers that grief naturally loves to be alone . By 1773 Johnson had perhaps become convinced that he could not expect from his readers enough Greek to follow him and Junius; at any rate he added a gloss after monos: "single or solitary, . . ." (34) 1755: Words arbitrarily formed by a constant and settled analogy, like diminutive adjectives in ish, as greenish, bluish, adverbs in ly, as dully, openly, substantives in ness, as vileness, faultiness, were less diligently sought, and many sometimes have been omitted, when I had no authority that invited me to insert them; . . . . The reading many sometimes is clearly faulty, although Johnson had let it slip past him when he revised the Preface for the second edition: many words cannot with propriety be sometimes omitted. In 1773 Johnson solved the difficulty by deleting many . But the error in the first edition must be accounted for. I suspect that Johnson originally wrote and may sometimes have been omitted, and that the first-edition compositor misread may as many . If this was the original reading, it gives a sense preferable to that which results from Johnson's deletion of many , for the fourth edition text makes it seem that Johnson knows which of these words have been omitted, whereas the point is clearly that he does not know. A bold editor might introduce may into the text. (36) 1755: The participles are likewise omitted, unless, by signifying rather qualities than action, they take the nature of adjectives; as a thinking man, a man of prudence; a pacing horse, a horse that can pace: these I have ventured to call participial adjectives . 1773 reads: "unless, by signifying rather habit or quality than action, . . . ." The qualities of the first edition conceals a distinction conveyed in Johnson's two examples, of which, in the 1773 text, habit (defined in the Dictionary as "a power or ability in man of doing any thing, when it has been acquired by frequent doing the same thing" [Locke]) is illustrated by thinking, and quality ("accomplishment; qualification") by pacing . (40) 1755: There is another kind of composition more frequent in our language than perhaps in any other, from which arises to foreigners the greatest difficulty. We modify the signification of many verbs by a particle subjoined; as to come off, to escape by a fetch; to fall on, to attack; . . . . In 1773 "the signification of many verbs" is altered to "the signification of many words." This seems to be a compositor's error. This type of composition is confined to verbs, as is shown by the list of examples, all of which are verbs, and by Johnson's reference at the end of the paragraph to "combinations of verbs and particles." (47) Johnson confesses that he has been unable to explain some words because he does not understand them. In the first edition he says: . . . when Tully owns himself ignorant whether lessus, in the twelve tables, means a funeral song, or mourning garment; and Aristotle doubts whether οὔρευς, in the Iliad, signifies a mule, or muleteer, I may freely, without shame, leave some obscurities to happier industry, or future information. For I may freely the 1773 text has I may surely . Johnson perhaps sought a more modest tone. (69) 1755: Thus have I laboured to settle the orthography, display the analogy, regulate the structures, and ascertain the signification of English words, to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer: but I have not always executed my own scheme, or satisfied my own expectations. Johnson changed this in 1773 to read: Thus have I laboured by settling the orthography, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures, and ascertaining the signification of English words, to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer: . . . . This change eliminates an awkward shift in construction in the original text, where to perform . . . must be taken not as the final member of a series, which it appears at first to be, but as a summary phrase. In improving the syntax Johnson did not notice, or chose to disregard, the new implication of the sentence—that he had in fact settled the orthography, displayed the analogy, etc.—an implication denied in the second clause, in the rest of the paragraph, and in the two paragraphs that follow. (72) 1755: When first I engaged in this work, I resolved to leave neither words nor things unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, the obscure recesses of northern learning, which I should enter and ransack, the treasures with which I expected every search into those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with which I should display my acquisitions to mankind. In 1773 the passage reads instead: . . . and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, with the obscure recesses of northern learning, which I should enter and ransack; the treasures. . . . The original reading is clear, and the change in 1773 produces some difficulty. In the first edition, prospect controls a series of four parallel elements— hours, recesses, treasures, and triumph . The with added before the obscure recesses in 1773 destroys this parallelism and appears to initiate a new one, less precise than the old, between prospect and recesses; and the added with must also be understood as preceding the treasures and the triumph, for Johnson, if he made this change, could not prefix a with to each of these because each is followed by a with -construction. This is all very awkward; it is also imprecise, for although Johnson could please himself in advance with the prospect of recesses of learning he intended to enter, he could not please himself with the recesses themselves, as the altered reading would have it, until he had entered them. If this is Johnson's change, he was careless, as he appears to have been nowhere else in the course of this revision. Despite the general accuracy of the compositor, therefore, I attribute this change to him rather than to Johnson. (73) 1755: I then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance than assistance: by this I obtained at least one advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be finished, though not completed. In 1773 Johnson altered the ending to read "which would in time be ended, though not completed." This is an elegant change, and shows Johnson at his most fastidious. In the Dictionary to end is defined as "to terminate; to conclude; to cease; to fail," and to finish as "1. to bring to the end purposed; to complete. 2. to perfect; to polish to the excellency intended. 3. to end; to put an end to." The same nicety appears in the Advertisement Johnson composed for the 1773 edition: "Many are the works of human industry, which to begin and finish are hardly granted to the same man." (74) 1755: Many of the distinctions which to common readers appear useless and idle, will be found real and important by men versed in the school philosophy, without which no dictionary ever shall be accurately compiled, or skilfully examined. In 1773 ever shall is transposed, by Johnson, I presume, to shall ever . (84) 1755: Those who have been persuaded to think well of my design, require that it should fix our language, and put a stop to those alterations which time and chance have hitherto been suffered to make in it without opposition. In 1773: Those who have been persuaded to think well of my design, will require. . . . I am not sure what to make of this. It does not look like the compositor trying to repair a sentence he found difficult to understand. Perhaps Johnson in 1755 had in mind the hopes actually expressed by friends, and in 1773, these circumstances being long past, recast the sentence to give not only a better rhythm but a firmer contrast to his own shifting opinions as expressed in the next sentence. (84) 1755: When we see men grow old and die at a certain time one after another, from century to century, we laugh at the elixir that promises to prolong life to a thousand years; and with equal justice may the lexicographer be derided, who being able to produce no example of a nation that has preserved their words and phrases from mutability, shall imagine that his dictionary can embalm his language, and secure it from corruption and decay, that it is in his power to change sublunary nature, or clear the world at once from folly, vanity, and affectation. In 1773 the lexicographer is made to imagine that he can "change sublunary nature, and clear the world at once from folly" etc. The change, which I take to be Johnson's, heightens the vanity of the lexicographer and perfects the parallelism of the last two clauses. (88) In 1755, Johnson, commenting on Swift's proposal that words should not be allowed to become obsolete, says: But what makes a word obsolete, more than general agreement to forbear it? and how shall it be continued, when it conveys an offensive idea, or recalled again into the mouths of mankind, when it has once by disuse become unfamiliar, and by unfamiliarity unpleasing. The inversions at the end of this passage are changed in 1773 to the straightforward "when it has once become unfamiliar by disuse, and unpleasing by unfamiliarity." Since Johnson's style in his later prose tends to be less artfully contrived than in his earlier writing, I take this change to be his. (92) As already noted, Johnson in 1773, as in the second edition, softened . . . that we may no longer yield the palm of philology to the nations of the continent to . . . that we may no longer yield the palm of philology, without a contest, to the nations of the continent. (94) 1755: . . . it may gratify curiosity to inform it, that the English Dictionary was written with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academick bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow: and it may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to observe, that if our language is not here fully displayed, I have only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed. The rhythm and power of this noble passage are enhanced by Johnson's revision in 1773: he ends the first sentence with sorrow, deletes the and, and begins a new sentence with It . On the basis of this comparison of the texts of the four editions of the Preface printed in Johnson's lifetime, the relationships among them may be summarized as follows: (1) the second edition, 1755-56, was printed from the first; there is no sign that Johnson or the compositor returned to the manuscript (and a strong sign that they did not; cf. the deletion in (38)). (2) the third edition, 1765, was printed from the second: wherever the second edition varies from the first, the third edition follows the second; when the third varies from the second, it never returns to a reading of the first; the third edition introduces no readings which can be attributed to Johnson. (3) the fourth edition, 1773, was printed from the first, with revisions by Johnson independent of those he introduced into the second-edition text: the fourth edition does not follow the third in any of its variations from the second, nor, with the exceptions already accounted for, does it follow the second in any of its variations from the first. We have, then, three texts of the Preface—since the text of the third edition may be disregarded—which possess textual authority. The second and fourth editions present texts independently revised, and contain substantive changes of importance. It does not appear from the number of these substantive changes that Johnson's revision of the Preface for either edition was systematic; this fact, together with the nature of the changes in the accidentals of the texts, suggests that he did not extend his attention to the details of spelling and punctuation, and that the changes in the accidentals are probably not by Johnson. Nor can all the substantive revisions in the two editions be automatically ascribed to Johnson; most of them are surely his, but some, as I have tried to show, may be suspected. We need not be surprised at Johnson's failure to recall, in 1773, the revisions he had made in the Preface late in 1755. During the intervening eighteen years he had, as he wrote to Boswell, "looked very little into" the Dictionary, 6 and he had been heavily occupied with other writing. And the revisions made in 1755 were not on the whole so striking—with a single exception, perhaps—as to stick for years in the mind of a man who wrote and revised much. Nor need we, on the other hand, be surprised that Johnson, even if he had forgotten the changes made in 1755, did not once more notice at least the errors he had then corrected, if not the elegancies he had added, and correct them again in 1773. Both revisions were rather casual performances, not at all like his thorough-going work on the Rambler . He evidently read rapidly through the text, mending or improving where something happened to catch his eye. The two sets of revisions therefore complement each other. Each represents, for certain passages in the Preface, Johnson's "final intention." And the editorial procedure to be adopted in the light of these circumstances is clear. There is no ground for adopting, as the copy-text for an edition of the Preface, the text of the fourth edition. This has been the procedure followed in all editions since 1773, on the familiar theory that the last edition published in the author's lifetime is the one most likely to contain his final intentions with respect to the work. 7 Greg and Bowers have recently demonstrated that even for works whose textual history is more normal than that of the Preface to the Dictionary this is an editorial theory certain to produce corrupt texts. 8 For the Preface this theory has led, in all modern texts, to the exclusion of half of all the revisions made by Johnson, to the perpetuation of errors and stylistic defects which he had carefully expunged, and to the omission of several stylistic elegancies which he had added. Future editors must therefore adopt the text of the first edition as their copy-text and introduce into it the two sets of Johnsonian revisions from the second and fourth editions, together with such changes in the accidentals from these texts as seem necessary for correctness or consistency. The editor will have to determine for himself which of the changes made in substantive readings in the second and fourth editions are authoritative; I have tried to indicate which are Johnson's, but I do not suppose that I have chosen correctly in every case. But the editor cannot avoid the responsibility of making a choice. The resulting text will be a composite, but only a composite text can reflect accurately the composite of intentions which influenced Johnson in 1755 and 1773.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 As in David Nichol Smith's discovery of a manifestly Johnsonian sentence first introduced into the Preface to Shakespeare in the Johnson-Steevens edition of 1778: to the middle of the paragraph (beginning "But the admirers of this great poet") in which he opens the discussion of Shakespeare's quibbles, Johnson added this sentence, "What he does best, he soon ceases to do" (see Johnson on Shakespeare , ed. Raleigh [Oxford, 1931], pp. 207-208). Unfortunately, most modern editors have not added this sentence to the text. 2 Detailed references to the text of the Preface are difficult to make because of the length of the folio pages. In subsequent references in this paper I have therefore numbered the paragraphs of the Preface, following the practice of the Hill-Powell edition of Boswell's Life . The paragraph number is inclosed in parentheses: thus (74) par. 74. 3 In "Some Emendations in the Text of Johnson's Preface to the Dictionary," forthcoming in RES , I have given at greater length my reasons for conjecturing semi for fair . 4 Spelling: authours to authors (27), (63), (65), and (67); characteristicks to characteristics (38). Authour is the normal spelling throughout the Preface. Johnson regularly used the - ick spelling in this text: cf. domestick (12), fabrick (20), eccentrick (88), criticks (94), etc. Punctuation: myself, to myself (5); breadth to breadth , (9); dictionary, to dictionary (45). The first of these substitutes a lighter for Johnson's customarily heavier punctuation; the second is a clear error; the third, by substituting a lighter punctuation, obscures the syntax. Compositor's errors: existence of words to existence words (59); purposed to proposed (70); appear to be to appear to (74); versed in the school philosophy to versed in school philosophy (74). All of these are obviously errors except the change in (70); but Johnson's meaning in that paragraph demands the meaning of purposed , "to intend; to design; to resolve." 5 In the lists which follow it is to be remembered that the second and third editions read with the first. 6 Life, II, 205; 24 February 1773. 7 The latest editor of the Preface, John Crow, recognizes the main facts concerning Johnson's revisions, for he says: "Johnson's thoughts, second, third, and fourth, are difficult to trace. The second and third editions of the Dictionary contain corrections and some of them are obviously desirable. The fourth edition is the last corrected by Johnson, but it is evident that he made the corrections for this in a copy of the first edition and failed to incorporate some of the improvements of the second and third editions" ( Johnson: prose and poetry, selected by Mona Wilson [London: Rupert Hart-Davis, 1950], p. 11). Despite this statement, Crow prints the text of the fourth edition. And his statement of the facts is not entirely accurate: the third edition contains no authoritative corrections not found in the second, and Johnson in revising the text for the fourth edition did not incorporate any of the improvements he had made in the second edition. 8 See W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 19-36, and Fredson Bowers, "Current Theories of Copy-text, with an Illustration from Dryden," MP, XLVIII (1950), 12-20. Although I have not planned it as such, the present case may be regarded as another illustration of the correctness of the editorial procedure advocated in these two papers.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Type Sizes in the Eighteenth Century by Philip Gaskell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 'point' system is used by English-speaking type-founders and printers of the present day to measure the 'body-size' of a fount of type, in which the point is a unit measuring approximately one seventy-second of an inch. Points are not used to measure that part of a 'sort' of type, raised in relief upon the rectangular body which actually makes an impression on the paper, called the 'face'; 1 and for this purpose it is perhaps most convenient to use millimetres. The face can be placed upon a particular size of body in two different ways. One way, which is used to produce what may be called 'text types', is to cast a fount which includes both upper and lower-case sorts; this means that, in designing the face of such a fount for a particular body-size, allowance must be made for lower-case ascenders 2 and descenders, which will project beyond the vertical dimensions of the capital letters. The other sort of fount, usually called 'titling types', has no lower case, so that there need be no provision for lower-case ascenders and descenders; which means that the face of a capital letter can be almost as tall as the body on which it is cast. 3 To take an example of how this works out in practice, the face of the 72 point capital 'A' of 'Gill Sans' text type in the current Monotype specimen book (Monotype series 262) is 18 mm. high; the 72 point capital 'A' of 'Gill Sans Titling' (Monotype series 231) has a face that is 24¼ mm. high; and the body-size in both cases is 72 points, which is about 25¼ mm., or ·9962 in. Before the point system was adopted in the English-speaking countries during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a series of names was used to distinguish the various body-sizes most commonly employed. A list of these names, together with the body-size and face-size of the founts to which they refer, will be found at the end of this note. Although this list, and what follows, are based on an examination of eighteenth-century typefounders' specimens, they will be found to apply, with only occasional alteration, to typographical usage in Britain during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth centuries. The practice of the eighteenth-century founders with regard to the casting of text and titling faces on to the same size of body was, with one serious exception, exactly similar to the modern practice described above; it need only be remembered that they did not usually differentiate between the two varieties in their specimens. To take an example, Alexander Wilson and Sons' specimen book of 1772 4 begins with a 'Five Lines Pica' which turns out to be a titling type; in other words, the face-size of these capital letters takes up nearly the whole of the five lines of Pica named as the body-size. This fount is followed by other titling sizes from Four Line Pica to Two Line Small Pica, and they in turn by text sizes from Canon (which has a Four Line Pica body) to Pearl. But now comes the exception. Wilson's next specimen, the broadside of 1783, 5 appears to make nonsense of the nomenclature hitherto employed by him. The Six Line Pica of this sheet has capitals of titling size, the face being nearly six picas high; but it also has a lower case . In the same specimen, Five and Four Line Pica are displayed only by their lower case; but measurement discloses that the distance from ascender line to base line virtually fills the body named, leaving no room for descenders. I have taken Wilson as an example, but the same apparently inconsistent nomenclature is to be found in the specimens of a number of other eighteenth-century founders. Caslon's specimen book of 1764 6 shows capitals of Five and Four Line Pica which have capitals of titling size together with a lower case; and Fry's book of 1788 7 does exactly the same. Nor was this practice confined to the eighteenth century; the latest examples I have come across are in Specimens of Wood Letter (H. W. Caslon and Co., c. 1899). Page 8 shows Six, Eight, and Twelve Line Pica Old Face founts which are titling types with lower case; and the same system is used through the book for sizes up to Twenty Line Pica. There are two possible explanations of this anomaly. Since the occurence of titling types with lower case was confined to the larger sizes, it may be that they were not intended to be set solid. If so, then the lower case could have been cast on the body-size named, with projecting 'kerns' to accommodate the descenders of g, j, p, q, and y. Against this it may be said that kerns are a nuisance, both because they are easily broken and because descender kerns necessitate leading; 8 and that they are difficult to cast. 9 On the other hand, if kerns are rejected, then we must suppose that the real body-size of a titling fount with lower case called Six Line Pica was in fact about eight picas, not six; that the body-size of such a Five Line Pica was really six and three-quarter picas, and so on. Against this may be set the facts that the capitals of these queer founts can sometimes be found set solid (when there are no lower-case sorts about), showing a true titling body-size; and that this method would be more extravagant of type metal than would casting with kerns. It is hard to decide which method is the more likely. Some confusion would be avoided if bibliographers, when they speak of type-sizes by name, would agree to state plainly and repeatedly whether they are referring to text or titling types. It is, at any rate, quite essential to do so when there is any chance of confusion arising from the occurence of the ambiguously named types we have been discussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes on the Table This table is based on measurements taken from ten eighteenth-century specimens by Caslon, Wilson and Fry. The average of these measurements is given, so that the table is unlikely to be completely accurate with regard to the products of any one foundry. 10 It will be noticed that a few of the body-sizes are not quite the same as those given by Mr J. C. Tarr in a letter to The Library; 11 however, I am convinced that the sizes I give are more accurate than his as far as eighteenth century founts are concerned, which, with few exceptions differed remarkably little from each other in size. I imagine that Mr Tarr's measurements were taken from type of other periods, which would explain the slight discrepancy. It will be seen that one or two text types have the same sized capitals as some of the titling types (e.g., Two Line Great Primer text and Two Line Pica titling), and these correspondences are found even more frequently in the work of each individual founder. Probably both sets of capitals were cast in matrices made from the same punches. A similar technique seems to have been used to supply founts with Small Capitals; the small caps of a given fount often appear to originate from the punches of the capitals of the fount two or three sizes smaller.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 They are sometimes used to give an approximate idea of the face-size, as, for instance, in '10 on 12 point Perpetua'; in this case the depth of the body would be exactly 12 points, but the '10 point' face-size is peculiar to the design. The face of '10 point Perpetua' is appreciably smaller than that of '10 point Times'. 2 The ascenders of most modern founts are slightly taller than the capital letters of the same fount; the ascenders of most eighteenth-century founts were not. 3 The body-size is usually slightly greater than the maximum face-size of a fount. The projection, at the bottom, is measured from the edge of the face to the edge of the 'shoulder' of the sort (which includes the 'bevel'), and is called the 'beard'. There is usually a similar projection at the top, large enough at least to accommodate the bevel. 4 W. Turner Berry and A. F. Johnson, Catalogue of Specimens of Printing Types . . . 1665-1830 (1935), pp. 52-53. 5 Berry and Johnson, op. cit., p. 53. 6 To take an example that is reproduced by Berry and Johnson ( op. cit., plate 6); similar examples may be found in several other Caslon specimens. 7 Berry and Johnson, op. cit., plate 7. There is another good example in Fry's broadside of 1785, in which the largest fount is Four Line Pica titling with lower case; this immediately followed by Canon, which is the text version of Four Line Pica. 8 Some eighteenth-century printers, like their modern descendants, preferred to buy type cast on a large body, rather than to use leads. From the middle of the century most specimen books offered 'Pica on an English body', etc. 9 Not that the eighteenth-century founders lacked skill in casting. Nowadays founts are seldom cast in metal in sizes above 72 point (about Six Line Pica); but Caslon in 1764 was offering a fount, in metal, of Thirteen Line Pica. 10 Many of Baskerville's founts, particularly the text sizes from English down, were abnormal in size, and would require a separate table. 11 5th series, vol.

      <field name="heading_text">The Pre-Publication Printings of Tarkington's Penrod by Campbell R. Coxe</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Booth Tarkington's Penrod (Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., New York, 1914) has sold close to a million copies and has been rated as one of the outstanding American books of the first half of this century. Moreover, it has proved an interesting 'guinea-pig' for twentieth-century bibliographers. The first to approach the problem was Barton Currie, who in a 1932 Colophon article (vol. III, pt. 9) entitled "Hints to Tarkingtonians" discussed the then known points in an attempt to establish priority for interested collectors: namely, that the first "issue" was bound in light blue mesh cloth and measured one-eighth of an inch more across the top of the leaves than later "issues," which were bound in greenish-blue grained cloth and printed in blacker ink. Later in the same year appeared Currie's Booth Tarkington, A Bibliography, which included the Colophon article as an introduction and added the further important information that 20,000 copies were printed before its publication on March 26, 1914. In 1938 Jacob Blanck published some new points 1 : the earliest copies had the numeral 'viii' at the foot of that page, which was "partially or wholly removed" in later copies, and the first 'state' could be distinguished by the spelling 'sence' instead of the later state's 'sense' in line 23 on page 19. After considerable scholarly research D. R. Russo and T. L. Sullivan produced in 1949 their comprehensive Bibliography of Booth Tarkington 1869-1946, which considers the above points and two others which were inadvertently attributed to Currie through an error in the revision of the final manuscript. 2 The second of these latter two points was: "p. 344, line 6, 'l' present in 'perfectly', later dropped out." The difficulties of this account, together with a dissatisfaction with the bibliography's use of 'state' to avoid the much abused 'issue' where sufficient information was not at hand to indicate an impression, provided the incentive for the research which has led to this present paper. 3 In the first place, it did not seem possible for the missing 'l' on page 344 to have dropped out after printing started, for the sheets seemed to have been printed from plates and thus the 'l' ought to have been lost before the plates were made. If so, a type could not have dropped unless the setting had been made by monotype. Mr. Powers, an employee at Doubleday Press, who had been with the Country Life Press in 1914, confirmed these assumptions by stating that at the time Penrod was printed plates were used and monotype machines set the type. Further evidence that the 'l' was added to the plate came to hand when it was seen that the letter in question is shaky and malformed and that the preceding 't' and the following 'y' are not properly formed. This line of investigation established that the sheet for gathering [22], a normal quire of eight leaves in which page 344 is sig. [22] 7 v , was first printed with the 'l' missing. Comparison then demonstrated that both states of gathering [22] were indiscriminately distributed among the fourteen copies examined for evidence. The following table lists the variant copies in three groups for convenience of future reference: I (a) Page viii numbered; p. 19 'sence'; 'l' missing p. 344. (b) " " " ; " " ; 'l' present p. 344. (c) Page viii unnumbered; " " ; 'l' missing p. 344. (d) " " " ; " " ; 'l' present p. 344. II (a) " " " ; p. 19 'sense'; 'l' missing p. 344. (b) " " " ; " " ; 'l' present p. 344. III (a) " " " ; " " ; 'l' missing p. 344. (b) " " " ; " " ; 'l' present p. 344. Note: I &amp; II bound in sky-blue mesh cloth. III bound in sky-blue ribbed cloth. 4 With the exception of the state of 'presently' on page 344 and the elimination of the page number viii, the nine copies of Group I are sufficiently uniform to indicate that they came from the same impression. The "Ross" copy, classed as I(b), which is in the Smith Library of the Indiana Historical Society, contains a presentation inscription from the author dated March 29, 1914, to Morris Ross, then managing editor of The Indianapolis News . The presence of the second state of gathering [22] in this copy, which was inscribed only three days after publication, is of interest as evidence that the dropped 'l' was inserted in the plate of page 344 before any copies were bound. It is also worth notice that the correction must have been made late in the first press run or between the first and second printings noted below, owing to the number of sheets printed without the 'l', as evidenced by the first state of the sheet in the "Wing" copy at Yale, III(a). A comparison of the three copies in Group II with the nine in Group I produced conclusive evidence that the plates had been handled and a new imposition made before they were printed. The correction of 'sence' to 'sense' on page 19 is so perfect that it almost certainly indicates a resetting and a new plate. Even if we disregard many damaged page numbers and much damage to the type, which could conceivably have been caused by linting or press batter, the damage to three particular plates is worthy of consideration as evidence of handling. The right margin of page 153, lines 5 to 15, was quite obviously damaged by the ratchet key slipping when the plate was being locked to the bed for a new impression. Considerable damage to the type on page 167, running diagonally down the page from the heading to the lower left, appears to have been caused by handling the plate; the same is true of the damage to lines 2 and 3 from the bottom of page 182, which is the conjugate of page 167. Definite proof of a new imposition, however, is provided by the fact that the plates of the two half-titles, pages [i] and [1] (sigs. [1] 1 r and [1] 6 r ), are reversed. In the first half-title in Group I, which is printed as the second half-title in Group II, there is a diagonal white line running across the shadow on the girl's forehead which does not appear in the second; and the short curved line at the lower left of the boy's coat shows as an elongated "S" in the second half-title. Whereas the evidence in support of a separate impression for Group III is not so conclusive as that for Group II, it appears likely that there was indeed a third impression. There is new, if slight, margin batter which points to ratchet damage having occurred during a new imposition: see especially page 161, second line from the bottom, right margin; page 165, line 14, left margin; and page 232, right margin of lines 2 and 3 from the bottom. The damage to pages 167 and 182 in Group II has been partially repaired by reshaping some of the type faces and by morticing in new type. The latter process was undoubtedly used on the second line from the bottom of page 182, where through an error an inverted comma was inserted in place of a semi-colon which had been battered above the line. (This damage could have been repaired in press, but as corroborative evidence and as an interesting example of repair work it is included here.) The sheet bulk in Group III averages 3/32 of an inch less than that in Group II; and the binding is ribbed cloth instead of the mesh of the earlier copies. The last two points may assume new significance when considered in connection with the following supposition: That the publisher's estimate had to be expanded by two additional printings owing to the popular interest created by the magazine serialization which overlapped the publication date for the book. This was not a novel, but a collection of stories about a boy and his dog and his friends. Therefore, it seems reasonable that a printing of 10,000 copies was first planned, with two additional printings of possibly 5,000 each called for prior to publication. Unfortunately, no information was obtainable from the printer or publisher regarding the printings of this book. There can be little doubt that Group III also represents a pre-publication printing on the evidence of the presence of the first state of gathering [22] in the "Wing" copy at Yale, III(a). It is unreasonable to suppose that any of those sheets remained unused or undestroyed during the interval of more than two months between the March publication and the next 3,750 copies which were brought out in June (Currie, Bibliography, p. 63). I regret that I have been unable to find any copies of this later printing for comparison with those already examined; no doubt some interesting and instructive variations would be found. It may be of more general interest to conclude by listing a few points which developed from the study of Penrod and which represent printing evidence too often overlooked or misinterpreted by bibliographers of twentieth-century books. I hope to develop these on a future occasion. 1. It is almost safe to assume that plates were made before the first printing, but it is possible that some books were first printed from standing type in small impressions until such time as a demand for copies warranted the expense of plating. 2. It is well to determine if the type was set by monotype or by linotype, and whether it was plated before printing started. 3. If the type was plated, a dropped letter would indicate (a) that it was dropped prior to plating, and (b) that the type was probably set by monotype. A type set by linotype can appear to be dropped only if the compositor has inadvertently hit the spacer, an unusual accident. 4. Broken type does not, per se, denote a later state or printing. 5 5. Broken type can be repaired and plates corrected to some extent in press by morticing; i.e., by cutting out faulty letters and soldering in new type. (Mr. Richmond of Doubleday Press is of the opinion that in adding the 'l' on p. 344 the 'y' was also morticed out to provide more working space, which would account for the malformation of both letters in the later state.) 6. Damage to upper and lower page numbers and the headlines tends to indicate handling of the plates between impositions, but is not conclusive evidence. 7. However, ratchet batter to the margins of the plates, as evidenced by distortion or bending of the type face, is fairly definite proof of a new imposition. Such damage is the result of carelessness in permitting the ratchet key to slip while locking the plate to the bed. 8. In the case of bad damage, the press run on the sheet is stopped until a new plate can be made, which may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days before printing of that sheet can be resumed. 9. Sheet bulk does not vary to any great extent within an impression; however, any variation should be substantial before considering it as an indication of a separate printing. 10. Variations in the blackness of the inking can occur within the impression; one of the most difficult problems in book printing is holding even color from forme to forme. 11. Variant sheets can become mixed during the folding before any copies are bound, as the skids on which they are stacked are not necessarily delivered to the folding machine in any pre-arranged sequence. (During the war shortage when different papers had to be used, serious problems developed in binding together only gatherings of the same paper stock.)</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Morgan Copy of Machlinia's Speculum Christiani Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the result of a slight mishap in the printing house of William de Machlinia in London, the copy of the Speculum Christiani [c. 1486; Duff 415, STC 26012] in the Pierpont Morgan Library differs from the dozen other copies with whose readings I am acquainted either by personal inspection or through correspondence. These examples are the following: Cambridge, University Library and Trinity College; Chatsworth, Duke of Devonshire; London, British Museum (two copies) and Lambeth Palace; Manchester, John Rylands; New York, Public Library and Mr. Carl H. Pforzheimer; Oxford, Bodleian; San Marino, Henry E. Huntington; and Washington, Folger. The Morgan example is distinguished from its fellows by an interruption in the text which no method of folding can obviate. In short, on the verso of the third folio of this copy is found the text which should appear on folio 5 verso and on the fourth folio that which belongs to the sixth leaf; conversely, the verso of folio 5 has the text properly found on the verso of the third leaf, while on the sixth that portion occurs which is appropriate to leaf 4. This error in the printing, the incorrect "perfection" of a sheet (if so contradictory a term be allowed), is reasonably familiar to students of early printing; its most conspicuous example among the earliest English books is that found in the Devonshire-Huntington copy of the first printed book in English, The Recuyell of the Hystoryes of Troye by Raoul Le Fevre [Bruges: Caxton, c. 1475; Blades, Life and Typography of William Caxton, II, 6]. The Speculum Christiani was printed as a quarto with the first (unsigned) quire consisting of eight leaves; it follows from this that the opening quire consisted of two sheets of paper either folded together or folded separately, with the folded second sheet laid into the folded first. If the first procedure had been followed, the "affected" pages of the Morgan copy would be spread over two different formes, with [1] 3 v and [1] 6 being found in the outer forme of the second sheet, and [1] 4 and [1] 5 v in the inner forme of the first. However, in the second method of folding all four pages would have been found in the same forme (inner of the second sheet) and this is doubtless the method of printing employed by Machlinia. In that invaluable Vade mecum which the editor of Studies in Bibliography has thoughtfully provided for his grateful fellow-bibliographers (Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description, pp. 73-74), one finds this problem discussed with the writer's customary incisiveness; we learn that such an error arose either as a mistake in machining or through faulty imposition. Thus, the interruption in the text of the Morgan copy of the Speculum Christiani was due to the pressman who either perfected the sheet by "turning it the wrong way" or who had incorrectly imposed the type-pages, so that the already printed pages would inevitably be "backed up" but not "perfectly perfected." Quite recently Mr. Paul S. Dunkin ( BSA XLV, 246-50) has reviewed this problem and has concluded that it was "unlikely that a turned sheet or heap often, if indeed ever, caused wrong perfecting in books printed on hand presses." His belief is founded on the use made of the "points" or pins attached to the tympan, whose function it was to achieve correct "register." For a short explanation of this process, the reader is referred to Mr. Dunkin's account. Now it is obviously not impossible that the alternative explanation for such misprinting, suggested by McKerrow and quoted by Mr. Dunkin ("the second forme printed having been placed the wrong way round on the bed of the press"), may well have prevailed in the case of the Morgan sheet. Nevertheless, the fact that but a single copy with this particular error has survived as against a dozen correctly printed examples weighs rather heavily against this theory, at least in the opinion of the present writer. If the printer discovered the faulty imposition early in the course of machining, he could obviously cancel or destroy all leaves already perfected and thus completely eliminate the error from the entire edition. If he did not observe the fault until a goodly number had been printed and he needed the leaves to complete his edition, one would expect to find a percentage of copies with this misprint certainly far greater than the one in thirteen which is our highest possible estimate. Though my knowledge of the eighteenth-century printing techniques is not such as to permit me to disagree with Mr. Dunkin's conclusion so far as it affects that period, I must nevertheless affirm that the recommendations set forth in Moxon's Mechanick Exercises (1683) were apparently not at all familiar to the earlier printers. According to one authority (BMC I:xiv), as many as ten pinholes to each leaf have been found in the 42-line (Gutenberg) Bible; again, Konrad Haebler ( Handbuch der Inkunabelkunde, p. 67) records the occurrence of from six to eight such marks per sheet. At a very early date, the fifteenth-century printers reduced this number to four, and not much later to two, pinpoints. When four pinholes are present, these are normally not found in the middle fold of the early folios but in the four corners of the sheet, equidistant from the first (and the last) character of the first and last lines. In Ulrich Zell's early quartos, the pinholes are often found at the upper edge of the leaves, exactly parallel to the indentation of the text-page from the outer edge of the paper. In such positions, the points would not prevent the printer from turning the sheet the wrong way and still getting perfect register. This is certainly what might have happened in the present instance, assuming that the points were in such a position as not to prevent correct register when the sheet was turned the wrong way round. Just such cases as this doubtless brought about the practice recommended by Joseph Moxon, which would effectively eliminate misprintings of this sort, or at least have caused such misprinting that the sheet would have been quite useless for insertion in the book. If this be the true answer (as I believe it to be) for the origin of the faulty printing in the single case of the Morgan Speculum Christiani, I would further agree with Professor Bowers that this condition represents a variant copy, not a variant state, since it may well never have existed in more than this one example.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Melancholy Cavalier: A Study in Seventeenth-Century Plagiarism Sarah Dickson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some interesting problems arise for literary critic as well as bibliographer when an early work appears so applicable to later times that it is stolen, reprinted, and the real authorship of this later edition is concealed for three hundred years. That this can happen in the case of a very rare book is demonstrated by the discovery that The Melancholy Knight (1615) by Samuel Rowlands, of which the only known copy is in the Bodleian Library, 1 was reprinted in 1654 under the title of The Melancholy Cavalier by an author using the initials "J. C." as one of the attacks on the royalist party. Only two copies of this 1654 edition, printed for C. R., are known: the Thomason copy in the British Museum, and the Christie-Miller copy in the Arents Tobacco Collection of the New York Public Library. 2 The appropriation in 1654 of Rowlands' work indicates that poetic effusions of the Jacobean period were unfamiliar to the readers of the ephemeral productions of the Commonwealth versifiers. The appropriation was pertinent since the subject of the poem was not dated in 1654. A burlesque survey of a corrupt age was as timely in 1654 as in 1615. Except for an eight-line introductory poem describing the new woodcut of the cavalier smoking his pipe on the 1654 title-page, a dedication to William Middleton, and the statement of authorship as "by J. C.," the differences between Rowlands' Melancholy Knight and The Melancholy Cavalier are small. The most significant occur in the introductory lines To the Reader and in The Argument where there have been nine revisions. A few of these are trifling literary tinkerings, a few designed to insert contemporary allusions, 3 and some to adjust the description to the homely attire of the cavalier from the foppish dress of Rowlands' knight. 4 The poem proper was made to order for the pirate's purpose, and hence it is in the main an exact reprint of Rowlands' verses, with only a few tidyings to alter knight to cavalier, as in 1654, "But what an Age is this brave Cavaliers / (I mean all you, that Melancholy fears)" (p. 2), which in 1615 had read, "But what an age is this my fellow Knights / I meane all you whom melancholy bites)". In addition there is the addition of a contemporary touch or two, as changing 1615's battles of Newport and Ostend to Edgehill and Colchester. The identity of J. C. who thus stole Rowlands' poem in 1654 is the fascinating problem in The Melancholy Cavalier . There is the possibility, of course, that a stray copy of the Rowlands pamphlet fell into the hands of a publisher, who employed J. C. to touch up the poem for contemporary consumption. But it may also seem possible that in the interval between 1615 and 1654 some sheets of the 1615 edition had been in the hands of a printer, deriving from John Beale, who had printed the Knight, 5 and that this individual after Beale's death decided to turn a dishonest penny. I am inclined to conjecture that the unknown J. C. could have been the printer John Crouch, who wrote and published prolifically, mainly newssheets or "mercuries," first on the side of the royalists and then for the Commonwealth party. J. B. Williams refers to him as the author of a large number of counterfeits. 6 In 1650 his unlicensed press was finally swept away by the government and he was imprisoned. The experience must have been instructive, for after his release early in 1652 he changed sides and began producing periodicals which attacked the royalist party and were licensed by the government, chiefly "mercuries" written in prose with some interspersed verse. Williams (p. 146, n. 1) felt that "as a ballad writer Crouch possessed great skill and some of his verse is charming." It was in 1654, according to my conjecture, that in the midst of his journalistic activity he chose to issue The Melancholy Cavalier as an additional satire on the adherents of the royalist cause, printed "for C. R." 7 No matter who J. C. may have been, his dedication is a masterpiece of cool impudence since it was written with the knowledge that he was offering what was in fact the work of another. The Epistle Dedicatorie, to all Cordiall Lovers of Art and Ingenuity, more especially his much Honored Friend, Mr. William Middleton. 8 Sir, As there is no greater Ingagement then Gratitude, so there is nothing more blacke and Monsterous (to a generous Spirit) then the Contrary; I presumed nothing could be more proper to me to pay that debt I owe, or more acceptable to You, then this Piece of Fancy; which for Poetry, Witt and Invention, and variety of choice, Conceits may as well deserve Your Patronage, as I modestly presume, that Your candid Ingenuity will easily prompt you to accept thereof from him that is your reall Honorer, and Ever humbly Devoted, to your service, J. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This copy was bequeathed in 1640 by Robert Burton, the author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, a singularly appropriate donor. A reprint was made in 1849 at the Beldornie Press, the issue limited to sixteen copies. It was also included in the 1880 Hunterian Club edition of Rowlands, vol. II, limited to two hundred copies. Both reprints are very scarce. 2 Listed as Wing C 63; unknown to Hazlitt and Lowndes. The book was not entered in the Stationers' Register and has never been reprinted. 3 As for example 1654 "Mens heads with strange Reports to fill; / Of Plottes and Actions in th' Hylands, " for 1615 "Of what is done in forraigne lands". 4 For this purpose the last four lines of the "Argument" are rewritten in 1654: "His foot was spurning at a falling Crowne, / Which he esteem'd as his Tobacco smoake: / His Sword lay broake, his Cloaths did mending need / Only his Fancy did his wealth exceed." In 1615 these had read: "His hose the largest ever came to rowne, / And from his nostrils came such stinking smoake / Garters would make two ensignes for a neede / And shoo-ties that for circle did exceede." It is significant that the tobacco allusion is retained. Rowlands' satiric comments on tobacco were quite up-to-date in 1654 when many of the satires on the royalist adherents represented them as gaming, smoking, and drinking. 5 The Rowlands poem was entered to John Beale on 2 December 1614 (Arber, III, 558) but was not included among a transfer after his death of various titles to Humphrey Robinson on 16 March 1649 (Arber, I, 314). 6 A History of English Journalism to the Foundation of the Gazette (1908), p. 81. This Crouch is to be distinguished from another of the same name who was not active after 1640. See Plomer, Dictionary . . . 1641 to 1667 (1907), p. 58. 7 Still another possible candidate may be mentioned. This is a John Crouch who seems to have been a hanger-on of several noble families. He was excessively loyal to Charles II and prolific in eulogies of princes and other influential persons. Among his published works is a poem celebrating the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 (information from Joseph Hunter, Chorus Vatum [BM.Addit.Ms.24492], fol. 72). Although the dedication to William Middleton might perhaps fit him better than the humble printer, his loyalty to the crown does not suggest the author of an antiroyalist satire. 8 It seems probable that William Middleton was a member of the Middleton family of Belsay Castle in Northumberland (Richard Welford, Men of Mark 'twixt Tyne and Tweed [1895], p. 189). He succeeded his uncle in the estate in 1649. Both men had been nonconformists in religion, and the uncle had supported parliament against the king. William Middleton entertained and encouraged nonconformist ministers. His son married the grand-daughter of John Lambert, the parliamentary general. In 1654 he might have been receptive to the dedication of a poem satirizing the royal cause. Later, in spite of his views on politics and religion, he does not seem to have been in bad odor with Charles II, and he was created a baronet in 1662.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Early Editions of Dryden's State of Innocence Marion H. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nine quarto editions of Dryden's State of Innocence were printed before publication of the 1701 Folio of the Works, shortly after Dryden's death, brought to a close the early history of the text with a tenth edition. Although the chronological order of five of these editions is established by the title-page dates, which there is no reason to suspect, the same is not true for the remaining five, three of which bear the date 1684 and two the date of 1695. In Hugh Macdonald's Bibliography of John Dryden the order of listing of these editions is presumably intended to be chronological, although no statement is made concerning the evidence on which the order is based. The Woodward and McManaway Check List of English Plays 1641-1700 follows the Macdonald listing. However, textual collation of the nine quartos and of the Folio makes evident that this commonly accepted sequence is not correct, nor is the derivation of the various editions a simple matter of successive reprints as has been generally, though implicitly, believed. The following table summarizes what investigation establishes as the true order of the printed quarto texts. 1 Edition Date Macdonald W &amp; McM Q1 1677 81a 465 Q2 1678 81b 466 Q3 1684 81e 469 Q4 1684 81d 468 Q5 1690 81f 470 Q6 1692 81g 471 Q7 1695 81i 473 Q8 1695 81h 472 Q9 1684 * 81c 467 Obviously Dryden was concerned with the printing of the first edition of the play: the prefatory essay "The Author's Apology for Heroique Poetry and Poetique Licence" was written, he states, partly to explain why he chose to publish an opera that was never acted. Since textual collation shows no indication of fresh authority having been added to any of the later editions, and instead discloses only the usual steady deterioration of the text, it is clear that Q1 is the only substantive printed text of the play. In brief, the derivation of the texts is as follows: Q2 was printed from Q1, Q3 from Q2, and Q4 from Q3. Q4 is a terminal edition from which no other derived. Although Q3 and Q4 were both printed in 1684, the quartos are readily differentiated. Q3 collates A-G 4 , with advertisements on sig. G4 r-v . Q4 collates A-E 4 F 2 G 4 (G1 missigned F1). [See below for the differentiating points between Q4 and its piracy, Q9.] Q5 derives from Q3, Q6 from Q5, and Q7 from Q6. The 1701 Folio was printed from Q7. Q8 was printed from Q7. Since both Q7 and Q8 are dated 1695 and have the collation A-F 4 G 2 they could be confused unless one notices that in Q7 there is a semi-colon after Innocence in the running-title on $2 v 4 v (—G2 v ) and a semi-colon after and in the running-title on C3 v ; whereas in Q8 the semi-colon after Innocence is found only on C2 v 4 v , and a comma appears after and on C3 v . The piracy Q9 imitates the title-page and the collation A-E 4 F 2 G 4 of Q4, but its text derives immediately from Q8. However, there is no difficulty in distinguishing it from Q4 since Q9 uses running-titles in the headlines but Q4, instead, has only page numbers within parentheses. The total evidence on which this statement of derivation is based is too extensive for presentation here but may be briefly summarized. The lack of significant variation in the text of Q2, and the fact that its preface and the text for Act I is a page-for-page reprint of Q1, establishes that Q2 derives from Q1 and not from an independent manuscript. There are 22 substantive variants in Q2, eight of which are corrections of obvious errors in its copy. Of the remaining 14, 2 are simple misprints corrected in Q3, 3 are obvious errors but were retained until Q5, and the rest appear, with occasional modification, in all subsequent editions. Of these the most serious was the omission of the second half of the line in Act V (Q1, sig. G2 r ) Death you have seen: Now see your race revive, [.] 2 In substantives, Q3 has 18 variants from Q2 in addition to the Q2 variants from Q1 which it follows. In turn, all but three obvious errors in the Q3 total of variants appear in Q4, which—being carelessly printed—adds 49 unique substantive variants of its own. With only one exception, which may just possibly be coincidental, none of these unique variants appears in any later edition, this fact establishing Q4 as a terminal text. Q5, accepting all but the most flagrant of the Q3 variants, adds 19 to the list, all of which appear in Q6 together with 27 new readings. In turn, Q7, repeating all but four of the most obvious Q6 errors, adds 18 new substantive readings, of which 16 appear in Q8 together with 19 new variants. Q9, the last of the early quartos, presents a most peculiar case. Dated 1684 and having in its register of signatures and title-page typography a definite relationship with Q4, also dated 1684, it nevertheless shows (except for four pages) a page-for-page correspondence with Q8 printed in 1695. Superficially, the simplest view would be that this edition (Macdonald 81c) was a corrupt version of Q4 and that, eleven years later, it served as copy for Q8. Such an assumption is impossible, however. In the first place, Q4 (M 81d) could not have served as copy for any other edition because of its extraordinary number of unique and non-reversible readings which prove it to be a terminal text. Secondly, Q8 (M 81h) could not have derived from Q9 (M 81c) since Q9 with 38 unique readings, over half of which are non-reversible, is also shown to be a terminal text. Moreover, there is definite evidence that Q9 textually derives from Q8, a fact which re-enforces the otherwise ambiguous evidence of its general page-for-page correspondence with Q8. Of the 20 substantive variants which first appeared in Q8, 11 are simple errors which Q9 corrects; but Q9 follows the other 9 cases of Q8's hitherto unique variants and adds no less than 39 of its own. Thus Q8 could not have derived from Q9; and instead Q8 must have served as copy for Q9. This can be demonstrated, also, for sheet C and half-sheet F. We have, then, the peculiar situation that Q9, printed in imitation of Q4, and falsely dated, nevertheless did not choose Q4 as copy but instead was set up from the text of Q8. Whatever the reasons for this oddity, 3 the facts rule out inadvertence, the more especially since Knight and Saunders—listed in the Q9 imprint as sellers, in imitation of Q4—were no longer in business together by 1695. Piracy is the only answer, but the exact date cannot be determined except that it was in 1695 or after. There is one further peculiarity associated with Q9. Although there can be no question that Q8 served as printer's copy, Q9 corrects six Q8 readings by reversion to the forms found in some earlier edition. Since various of these in the Q8 forms were plausible enough to have escaped suspicion, simple compositorial ingenuity is insufficient to explain their revision, the more especially since they appear in clusters. Q8 reading Q9 revision possible source Shut from his day and that contented skie contended (C1 v ) Q1-4 Thy . . . voice the sleeping Gods we'll reach will (C1 v ) Q1-6 With wings expanded wide, ourselves will reach we'll (C1 v ) Q1-6 What raised thy Beings , ours will take away Being (F1 r ) Q1-6 Such beauty may rise factions in his Heav'n raise (F1 v ) Q1-6 Imprudence was your fault, but Love was mine is (G1 r ) Q1 If for the moment we disregard the variant on sig. G1 r , the evidence points only to some edition between Q1 and Q4 being collated to produce these revised readings. Since it is clear that the printer had had access to Q4, it would seem a natural assumption that Q8 for these pages had been collated against Q4. This is probably the answer, although there are difficulties. First, the return to a unique Q1 reading on line 5 of the adjacent page would need to be fortuitous. It is true that in context the change of was to is makes better sense; nevertheless, the was reading had passed muster with the compositors of Q2-8. Hence it might be possible to conjecture that Q1 was the collating copy and that this collation extended over to the top of sig. G1 r . Second, it may seem suspicious that in no case does Q9 follow a unique Q4 variant, 4 although two such unique readings would have been present for Q9 sig. F1, one for F1 v , one for F2, and three for F2 v . The text for Q9's sig. C1 v could have contained no unique Q4 reading, however. Yet we may be the more prepared to accept as chance the collator's invariable rejection of Q4's unique variants (which have nothing much to recommend them at best), since the alternative is the hypothesis that a copy of Q1 was used as the collating edition. In fact, the collation of Q1 (making three editions in the possession of the Q9 printer) could be advanced only if we assumed that Q4, although available for consultation, was not available to be kept on the premises. 5 This seems to invoke such special and peculiar circumstances that we are better off with the simpler hypothesis that Q4, which served as the specific model for the piracy, was also used for the small amount of collation actually engaged in. That any textual collation whatever with an earlier edition was contemplated, and in fact performed even to a minor degree, is a fact sufficiently astonishing in a late reprint and a piracy without our conjecturing such extraordinary textual conscience in the pirate as to secure a copy of Q1 for collation, when he was also in the possession of Q4. In truth, the only plausible explanation why this collation was ever engaged in was the availability of Q4 in the shop as a model for the piracy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 At a later date I propose to publish the results of a study of the five manuscripts of The State of Innocence, their order and relation to the Q1 text. * Q9 is a pirated edition with falsified date 2 In his edition of Dryden's plays Montague Summers' collation (III, 490-504) indicates that this half-line appears in two of the three manuscripts which he consulted but is missing from Q1. In fact, the half-line is found in all five of the extant manuscripts, and it is present in the six copies of Q1 which I have collated. Doubtless Summers misread his notes. 3 These are surveyed by Fredson Bowers in "The Pirated Quarto of Dryden's State of Innocence ," which follows in this volume. 4 The one exception occurs in the Preface, sig. A3 r , where the joint Q4, Q9 reading 'morality' for Q1-3, 5-8 'mortality' is unique. However, this is such a simple misprint that not much weight can be placed on its possible significance. 5 If so, the fact that Q1 was not pirated is simple and can be explained on grounds of expense, since the eight and one-half sheets of paper required for each copy contrasts unfavorably with the six and one-half sheets comprising the condensed Q4, Q8, and Q9 editions.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Pirated Quarto of Dryden's State of Innocence * Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "The Early Editions of Dryden's State of Innocence" appearing in the present volume, Dr. Marion H. Hamilton establishes the very curious fact that Q9 (Macdonald 81c) was printed not in 1684 as stated on its title-page but instead in 1695 or later. Moreover, although this misdated edition made an obvious effort to imitate a printing peculiarity of Q4, dated 1684 (M 81d), as well as its title-page, in fact it used Q8 of 1695 (M 81h) as its copy although Q4 seems to have been collated for certain readings on sigs. C1 v , F1, and F1 v . However odd these facts are, as Dr. Hamilton argues they point unmistakably to an act of piracy. My purpose in this note is to examine the reasons why Q9 may have drawn its text from Q8, though imitating the appearance of Q4; but more especially to endeavor to explain the curious clustering of variants, presumably drawn from Q4, only in two widely separated sheets of Q9. The story must begin with the peculiar collation of Q4 as A-E 4 F 2 G 4 , with G1 missigned F1 although G2 is correctly signed. Two possible explanations suggest themselves. When the typesetting of an edition is divided between two or more compositors and presses, the estimated division may prove to be inaccurate. If there is too little material assigned him, the compositor of the first section may be unable to space his setting to join exactly with the already-printed first sheet of the second section. In such a case, the first press will print its final gathering in less than a full sheet. As opposed to this, if the first press has been assigned more than its proper share of material, it will need to print an extra leaf or leaves. Since Q4 is not a paginal reprint of its copy, Q3, some such confusion might have developed. If so, the signing of G1 as F1 would point rather to extra than to insufficient material given to the first compositor (if the outer forme were first on the press), since it would seem that half-sheet F was an afterthought. This explanation, though possible, is not very satisfactory. If the point of division was originally assigned as between gatherings E and F, the play would have been so nearly typeset as to preclude any such plan ordered from the beginning. Normally a play to be printed simultaneously in two sections is divided close to the halfway mark. 1 Hence it would be necessary to conjecture that with Q4 a second press was ordered into action to print only the final sheet and thus to speed publication. If so, however, one might expect some evidence of a different compositor and press. Although the lack of running-titles prevents definite determination, there is nothing either in the length of the printer's measure or in the general typographical layout to lead one to suspect the presence of a second compositor and press. Moreover, if the missigning of G1 as F1 indicates an original plan to compress the Q3 makeup, the correct signing on G2 shows that the proper position of the sheet was known by the time the inner forme was sent to press. In other words, by the time the second, or inner, forme of G was machined, the compositor of the first section would have found that he could not include all of his material in sheet E. This reconstruction is not impossible, but it does not carry conviction, largely because such a major error in casting off printed copy so near the end of the book would be highly unusual. The second explanation, for which I am indebted to a suggestion made by Dr. Giles E. Dawson, is therefore to be preferred. According to this hypothesis, only one compositor and press were concerned with the entire printing of this edition, but when the time came to make up the formes for sheet F, four pages of text were inadvertently passed over. Accordingly, the final eight pages of type were imposed, outer forme first, and this outer forme was sent to the press, signed F. Sometime during the printing of this forme the error was discovered, and thereupon the forme was perfected, correctly signed G2 on the second leaf. To repair the mistake, half-sheet F was imposed and printed with the omitted four pages. Although I have not seen a close analogy for such an error in imposition, this explanation conforms most closely to the evidence of the quarto and is very likely correct. When we examine Q9, we see that the printer chose to disguise a piracy by imitating the makeup of Q4, an out-of-date edition and one containing a particularly noticeable aberrancy in its half-sheet F. The choice of Q4 to pirate, rather than Q8, was doubtless dictated in part because copies would not be common to provoke comparison, in part because the stationers named in its imprint were by 1695 with one exception inactive, and in part because reproduction of the Q4 abnormal makeup would be supposed sufficient to allay suspicions. These considerations would not operate if an attempt were made to pirate the most recent edition, available in quantity, and readily to be compared against an imitation. This may be sufficient to explain why the form of Q4, and not that of Q8, was pirated, but it fails to account for the odd fact that Q8 was used as printer's copy instead of the natural candidate Q4. One possible answer could appeal to the common custom of utilizing the last printed edition as copy for the next, a custom which seems to have had as a basis not only its obvious convenience but also, perhaps, some feeling that a late edition was textually superior to its predecessors. With our knowledge of the degeneration of texts in the course of reprinting, this attitude—if indeed it were held—would seem to have been singularly naive. Yet from one point of view, at least, and this could have operated very powerfully on a printer's thinking, a late edition was indeed superior in that it offered for copy a modernized form of the texture to an age critical of old-fashioned ways. Moreover, a very practical reason could be present. If a printer is to make a line-for-line and page-for-page reprint, clearly it is more convenient in setting lines which will require a minimum of justification to choose as copy a text which in its accidentals will be nearest in modernity to those of the compositor setting the new edition. If this explanation is valid, we should have the reason why the pirating printer of Q9 chose to set up what is substantially a page-for-page reprint of Q8, disguising it by imitating the title-page of Q4, and the Q4 aberrant half-sheet F, instead of utilizing Q4 as his copy. 2 The chief problem in Q9 is the necessity to explain the particular pages on which variants appear, indicating collation with some earlier edition, very probably Q4. Here the bibliographical evidence of the running-titles is important. In the first place, only one skeleton-forme was used to print the entire edition, this skeleton imposing the type-pages for both the inner and outer formes of every sheet. This evidence shows that the Q9 edition-sheet was a small one, in which presswork would normally be faster than compositorial speed. 3 Secondly, the printer made sure of following his Q4 model by completing first a paginal typesetting of sigs. F1-2 v from Q8 and then sending these four pages to the press as F 2 printed by half-sheet imposition. Then he started the normal text by imposing and machining the inner forme of sheet C. This order can be demonstrated by the lucky chance that a variant typesetting of one running-title appears only on C3 v and F1 r , thus establishing that the same state of the skeleton-forme printed inner C and half-sheet F, one following the other. However, when this same skeleton imposed the outer forme of C and all subsequent formes, the running-title on C3 v had presumably pied and was reset. This evidence shows, moreover, that half-sheet F was printed before inner C, since otherwise we should need to assume that inner C was run off but before perfecting it the printer set and machined half-sheet F. The importance of this reconstruction lies in the fact that, with two possible exceptions, the Q9 divergences from Q8 copy to restore earlier readings are confined exclusively to half-sheet F and to the inner forme of sheet C, which can be shown to have been printed one following the other. Such a remarkable coincidence of bibliographical and textual evidence cannot be fortuitous. 4 Two alternative explanations may be advanced for this peculiarity. The first and the simplest is that proof was read against Q4, Q8 being in the compositor's hands, and that these variants are therefore proof-reader's markings. The second is that the compositor hastily and incompletely collated the Q8 text against some early edition, probably Q4, before typesetting, and made notes in his Q8 copy of the variants he happened to observe or thought to be sufficiently significant to warrant alteration. A choice between these can only be speculative. Against the hypothesis for a proofreader is the fact that in general proof does not seem to have been read on reprints, and certainly not against copy. This last is unusual enough even for first editions. Against the compositor is the unusual care and initiative the process would evince. But since these variants manifestly were made by collation in some fashion against an early edition, more than usual care is shown, at least at the start of the printing. This last fact is of interest, for the demonstrable variants cease after the printing of half-sheet F and inner forme C (specifically, C1 v ). The evidence may suggest, therefore, that the compositor was the collator, that he was setting by formes, 5 and that he stopped probably after collating C1 v . The reason is not far to seek, I think. Since the edition was small, as evidenced by the use of only one skeleton-forme, typesetting was almost certainly slower than presswork once distribution had to be started, and hence it soon became clear that the luxury of collation could not be managed without delaying the press inordinately. It was, therefore, discontinued, and the remainder of the play was set directly from uncollated Q8 copy in the most expeditious manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This note derives from investigation for a Bibliography of Restoration Drama under grant from the Research Council of the Richmond Area University Center. 1 For various examples, see my "Bibliographical Evidence from the Printer's Measure," Studies in Bibliography, II (1949), 153-167. 2 If we reject this, we are forced into the alternate hypothesis, which has its difficulties, that though the Q9 printer had access to an example of Q4 he could not obtain it as printer's copy, and so contented himself with making notes of its title-page and of its F 2 abnormality. But as Dr. Hamilton points out, such a case would be very odd indeed; moreover, it would force us into accepting Q1 as the quarto used for collation to provide the variant readings. 3 For running-title evidence applied to the size of an edition, see Charlton Hinman, "New Uses for Headlines as Bibliographical Evidence," English Institute Annual (1941), pp. 207-222. 4 Dr. Hamilton's evidence, available in complete form in her University of Virginia dissertation on the text of The State of Innocence, leaves no doubt that in the pages in question Q8, and not Q4 or any other edition, served as copy for Q9, even though annotated by a few revisions from an earlier edition. The two exceptions noted are the change of was to is on G1 r , noticed by Dr. Hamilton, and the correction on C4 v of Q7-8's "And that fair light which glides this new made orb" to the Q1-6 reading gilds . Neither correction would seem to be beyond the capabilities of the Q9 compositor. 5 If the proof-reader were the collator, there is some difficulty to assigning the reason why he stopped so early, whereas a reason may be adduced for the compositor. Moreover, a check on seven copies of Q9 does not disclose correction of these formes in press. However, such proof-corrections could have been managed, albeit with delay, before printing the formes. If there is indeed a relation between the printing of C(i) before C(o) and the isolation on C1 v of these revisions, the compositor was probably casting off copy and setting by formes, which in this case would mean no more for him than making a paginal reprint of the inner forme of C in Q8. But it is as possible to suppose that he started regularly with C1 r and found no variants worth marking until he came to C1 v .</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The first edition of Thomas D'Urfey's comedy, The Richmond Heiress: Or, A Woman Once in the Right, presents a number of interesting bibliographical problems. It was first published in 1693, evidently from a manuscript which had served as a prompt copy or, rather more likely, which had been marked to serve as the basis for a transcribed prompt book. An actor's name appears sporadically in place of the character he portrayed; more important, warnings to the actors about to enter the scene have crept into the text in two places. 1 The quarto collates A-I 4 , pp. [ 8 ] 1-32 29-36 41-64 (all pp. in parentheses except for 57-64 in square brackets). The book appears to be very carelessly printed, very likely in considerable haste. This edition exists in two distinct issues, the second of which, as we shall see later, is a reimpression except for two sheets. The first issue, distinguished as (i), exists with the outer forme of sheet A, including the title-page, in two variant states. In the earliest pulls of this forme (iτ) the title-page reads as follows: THE | Richmond Heireſs: | OR, A | Woman Once in the Right . | A COMEDY, | ACTED | At the THEATRE ROAYL, | By Their Majesties Servants. | [rule] | Written by THO. D'URFEY, Gent. | [rule] | LONDON , | Printed for Samuel Briſcoe, over-againſt Wi l l 's Coffee-Houſe | in Covent-Garden . 1693. stent ROAYL Wi l l 's Issue (iτ) Copies examined: Folger (2.6.47), Huntington (123057). Copy reported: British Museum (644.h.23). Comparatively early in the printing (on the evidence of the few copies preserved of this early state) the press was stopped. On the title-page the misprint 'ROAYL' was corrected to 'ROYAL', and the line attributing the authorship to D'Urfey was revised to read | Written by Mr. D'URFEY . | This produces state (i*), performed by press-correction with the remainder of the type of the title left undisturbed. The alteration of the line containing the author's name has an interesting background. In 1691 D'Urfey had been scathingly attacked in the epistle dedicatory of the anonymous pamphlet Wit for Money, in which he was referred to as, "a certain Poet, who before the Poll Acts, used to write himself T. D. Gentleman. . . ." The original form of the Heiress title-page seems to have been the work of the printer, therefore, and the change made by the author himself. This view is substantiated by important textual changes made elsewhere in the outer forme of this sheet at the same time as the revision of the title-page. On sig. A2 v 'The Scene Richmond- Hill.' was added beneath the dramatis personae. On A4 v a necessary correction was made in the text in stanza 3 of 'SHINKEN's Song to the Harp' by the alteration of 'Highfoot' to 'light-foot'. On the same page in 'SONG . In the Last ACT' the word 'Philosophers' was altered to 'Philosophey' in the last line of stanza 3; in the third line of stanza 6 'A Health' became 'Success'; and simultaneously an entire new stanza, a seventh, was added to this song. These are clearly authorial revisions. Issue (i*) Copies examined: Folger (10.21.43), Folger (8.30.46), Chicago, Columbia, Library of Congress, Illinois (822.08 / P699), Newberry, Pennsylvania. Copies reported: Bodleian (Mal. 47[6]), Worcester College Oxford, National Library of Scotland. During the course of impression in this first issue, one small press-correction was made in sheet E, when on sig. E2 in the last line 'I must needs, nay,' was altered to 'I must needs say,'. However, both formes of sheet H were heavily press-corrected on every page. A total of ten variants appear in the inner forme, the most convenient identification being in line 12 of H1 v where the stage-direction '[ to Doggett.' of the early pulls was altered in the corrected state of the forme to '[to Quickwit.' . Most of these variants represent correction of egregious compositorial misreadings and lapses, but several represent literary revision. In the outer forme of H appear twelve similar corrections. In addition to these the warning to the actors, '[ Sir Charles.T.Romance, Shink.Guiac. Constable.' at line 5 of H1 in the uncorrected state is eliminated in the corrected. The two stage directions on H1 (lines 24-25 and 29-31) are reset, the first being made less crowded, and the second indented from the left margin, this last producing consequential changes in the lineation. In all the copies observed, both formes of sheet H were either in their uncorrected or else in their corrected states; in no case was an uncorrected forme backed by a corrected, or vice versa . It is an equally curious fact that owing to the distribution of the sheets in the binding process, every observed copy of issue (iτ) with uncorrected sheet A (containing the 'ROAYL' title) is bound with uncorrected sheets E and H. Moreover, every observed copy of issue (i*) with corrected sheet A ('ROYAL' title) was bound either with uncorrected sheet E but corrected sheet H, 2 or else with corrected sheet E and uncorrected sheet H. 3 No observed copy of (i*) contained both E and H uncorrected or both corrected. Before passing on to the second issue (reimpression) and its variants, I should say something of the printing of issue (i), since certain facts in relation to this have a bearing on the interpretation of the peculiarities of issue (ii). The evidence is, unfortunately, somewhat contradictory and at first sight not susceptible to an exact bibliographical solution. For example, if we took only the evidence of spelling tests to determine compositors, we should divide the book into sheets B-E set by compositor X, and sheets F-H set by compositor Y. What evidence there is would assign sheet A to workman X. As for sheet I, it is quite anomalous since it contains some characteristics of both X and Y. A marked compositorial break seems to occur beginning with sheet F. Compositor X Y ? Sheets B C D E F G H I I'll 15 15 9 22 12 5 17 18 I'le (or Ile) 3 7 3 ile 2 intrigue (and forms) 6 3 5 1 2 intreague (and forms) 3 4 7 'Gad 7 1 3 6 Gad 3 12 11 7 Quickwit 6 2 6 3 1 2 1 9 Quickwitt 2 2 2 Marmalet 1 1 5 3 1 1 Marmalett 5 1 Hotspur 2 4 1 6 1 Hotspurr 2 1 2 Shinken 2 1 3 1 Shinkin 4 3 3 6 3 Roman scene numbers 1 2 1 1 1 Arabic scene numbers 1 3 4 This table seems to point to only one compositor of sheets B-E, a workman of regular characteristics. Correspondingly, at least for sheets F-H, another compositor seems to be present, one of mixed characteristics but nevertheless in the majority of cases differentiating himself from the first workman. On the basis of four appearances of the spelling 'intrigue' (and forms) in the dramatis personae, there are grounds for assigning sheet A to compositor X. Sheet I is troublesome. The compositor shares with X the invariable spelling 'I'll', the invariable spelling 'intrigue' (once on I2 v 'intriegue'), and the spelling of 'Quickwit' and 'Marmalet' with single final consonant. On the other hand, he doubles the last consonant in 'Hotspurr' like Y; also like Y he does not place an apostrophe before 'Gad' and he employs the invariable spelling 'Shinkin'. A breakdown of the occurrences of these variants by pages does not encourage a hypothesis that X and Y alternated. Although X could have set I1 r , and Y could have set I1 v -2 v , on I3-4 r there is the clash between Y's 'Gad' without apostrophe, one to each page, and X's spellings of 'Quickwit', 'Marmalet', and 'intrigue'. Possibly another compositor, Z, is present, a workman of mixed characteristics in following copy. It should also be noticed that the compositor of sheet F, though in most respects associated with the characteristics of compositor Y, especially in such important invariables as 'Shinkin', 'intreague', and 'Gad' without apostrophe, yet is heavy on the 'Hotspur' spelling, once uses (on sig. F1 r ) a roman scene number, once the 'Marmalet' spelling, and is unique in setting parentheses about stage directions instead of the square brackets invariably used elsewhere in both sections. The odds are that he is Y, but some doubt may exist. The evidence for a sharp break in compositorial characteristics occurring between sheets E and F strongly suggests the hypothesis that this book, like so many Restoration play quartos, was divided approximately in half between two compositors and presses and the two sections simultaneously typeset and printed. Moreover, this evidence is buttressed by the significant fact, commented on below, that in the reimpression which constitutes issue (ii) both sheets B and F (the start of the two sections of text) show no signs of reimpression and are definitely sheets from the same run as issue (i). This further serves to differentiate the two sections of the book, and may be taken as confirming the general hypothesis for simultaneous printing in two major sections. Yet it is by no means certain that only two compositors and presses were involved. Sheet I, for example, with its unique headline square brackets and its mixed spelling characteristics seems to be associated with a different compositor and press, brought in to help finish the book as quickly as possible. In the second section the two preceding sheets G and H definitely are the product of only one workman, on the evidence of the spelling but more important on the evidence of their similar type-page measurement of 48 ll. 194-5 (205-6) x 122 mm. But sheet F, already mentioned as slightly irregular in spelling, not only has smaller page numbers in the headlines than those in sheets G and H but also was set to fit a quite different skeleton-forme, its average type-page measurement being 46 ll. 188(198) x 126. Moreover, 20 lines of its type measures about 82 mm., whereas the type measurement for sheets G and H is about 81 mm. Thus sheets G-H would seem to have been set by a different compositor from that of F (which on the whole is difficult to believe), or else there was a delay in the printing after the composition and machining of sheet F. In the first section there seems to be a similar break. Sheets B and C have the same small numbers in the headline, approximately the same type-page measurements, and seem to have been set with the same printer's measure of 119-120 mm. and in the same font of type. Yet sheets D and E change to larger figures in the headlines, and are set to fill a different skeleton-forme, since their measure changes to 126 mm.; moreover, though sheet E has apparently the same font of type as B-C, about 81 mm., that in sheet D is an 82 mm. type. Since the spelling tests make it almost impossible to conjecture more than one compositor, clearly this is an anomaly. Possibly a delay between C and D can be posited here, as could be conjectured between F and G; but if so, it is a little more difficult to explain why all the observed copies of issue (ii) contain sheet C re-impressed. Issue (ii), with the exception of sheets B and F, was printed from the standing type of issue (i) re-imposed and in parts revised. The title-page now reads: THE | Richmond Heireſs: | OR, A | Woman Once in the Right . | A COMEDY, | ACTED | At the THEATRE ROYAL, | By Their Majesties Servants. | [rule] | Written by Mr. D'URFEY . | [rule] | LONDON , | Printed for Samuel Briſcoe , over-againſt Will 's Coffee-Houſe | in Covent-Garden . 1693. stet Will 's This is the same form as in issue (iτ), and represents the standing type of this issue, although there have been a few typographical alterations. The letter 'R' in 'Richmond' has been changed from one with a straight tail to a sort with a curved tail. The lower rule, broken in (i), has been replaced and the two rules moved nearer each other. In (i) the rules are 25 mm. apart, but in (ii) only 18 mm. The roman 'l' in 'Wi l l 's' of issue (i) has been replaced with an italic type. On A4 v the spelling Philosophey in the third stanza of the song in the last act has been altered to Philosophy . In the other sheets changes in the alignment of the page numbers in the headline in relation to the text, or alterations in the font used to set the paginal headlines, demonstrates that the type-pages have been stored and reimposed for a second impression. There is no question, however, that sheets B and F in both issues come from a single impression, since there is no alteration in the headlines or in the text. Moreover, the outline of a hair on the face of the type across lines 16-18 of sig. B1 v is present in both issues, presumably an impossibility if the type-page had been rinsed and stored between impressions. Before the impression a few, mostly minor, corrections were made in the standing type. For instance, on C2 v , line 25, 'hear you are' in (i) was altered properly to 'here you are' in (ii). That these were the sole responsibility of the printing house is shown by the miscorrection that followed on C3 r , line 7, of 'She hear!' to 'She here!' through a misunderstanding of the context. Some few of the differences result from type dropping out, as the disappearance of the u between impressions in the speech-heading on G2 v , line 20, from 'Quick.' in (i) to 'Qick.' in (ii). Viewed as a whole, the alterations made in standing type do not suggest authorial intervention. Of the text, such variants appear only on C2 v , C3, G2 v , G3, H2, H3 v , I4 v . Grouped thus as formes, it is likely that the slight changes were made just before printing the second impression. More important changes appear, however, in the second impression, since a certain amount of resetting is found. Thus the whole of sigs. D1 v and D2 appear in a new typesetting, as well as the whole of G4 v and the last 15 lines of G1. The variant settings may be identified as follows: D1 v , line 8, 'four' with a comma in (i) but no comma in (ii); D2, line 26, 'surprized' in (i) but 'surpriz'd' in (ii); G1, line 34, 'disturb' in (i) but 'desturb' in (ii); G4 v , line 1, ends with 'Heiress' in (i) but 'Heiress agen' in all but one copy of (ii). The text in these reset portions shows normal compositorial corruption and there is no evidence that any variant has authority. Within sheets D and G these reset portions are confined to a forme from each sheet. Although it may be that they resulted from accidental pieing in handling the type, another suggestion is possible and will be offered later. Issue (ii), normal form Copies examined: William A. Clark, Folger (9.3.46), Folger (cs 368), Illinois (uncatalogued, 24 Je 47 Spencer), Princeton, Texas (Aitken). Copies reported: Harvard, Yale, British Museum (G. 18953[5]), British Museum (81.c.5[5]), British Museum (841.d.27), Bodleian (C.6.14[12] Linc.), Bodleian (Douce D subt. 66[6]), Victoria and Albert Museum. The second issue exists in several variant states. Among the copies examined, Huntington (123058) is unique in possessing an added leaf (bound between A3 and A4) which is paged 61 and 62 and contains a song "The Country Gentlemen" on recto and verso. 4 The pagination is enclosed in square brackets, similar to the practise in sheet I of the text. This addition is accompanied in the Huntington copy by two cancellations made to include revisions to the text. The Gentleman's Journal for November, 1693, noticed: "Mr. Durfey's Richmond Heiress has been Revis'd, and Acted several times, with Alterations and Amendments." The revisions on cancel leaves G3 and I1 would appear to reflect these later changes, at least in part. In IV.iii on G3 r the changes take away comment on Tom Romance's intrigue with Mrs. Stockjobb in order to emphasize the romance with Sophronia which figures so prominently at the end of the play. Various additional disparaging remarks about Tom's father seem to heighten Tom's role as a profligate and so justify the more his final undoing later. In order to insert this new material, G3 r was reset in smaller type, with 55 lines to the page as against 48 in the cancellandum, and some of the revision was carried over onto the verso, which is set in type similar to that of the original leaf. Parentheses are used about the headline page numbers in the cancellans. On sig. I1 the action of V.iv had originally continued with a farcical episode involving Numps. In cancellans I1 this action is excised completely and, instead, Scene Ultima begins at the head of the cancellans leaf recto with an interview between Sophronia and Tom Romance (lacking in the original version) before the entrance of Sir Charles, Guiacum, and Hotspur. Originally, their entrance, with that of Romance, had begun the first version of the final scene on cancellandum I1 v . Parentheses are used about the headline pagination of the cancellans. From the similarity of paper and the fact that the chain-lines match up, it seems reasonably certain that the added song bound in the Huntington copy's preliminaries and cancellans leaf I1 were printed together by half-sheet imposition and then cut apart for insertion. On the other hand, the paper of cancellans leaf G3 seems to differ slightly, and it may be that this represents a separate printing. 5 The Wrenn copy at the University of Texas also contains variants not found elsewhere. This copy is peculiar in that the title-gathering, sheet A, in the second state of the first impression (i *) is bound up with sheets B-I of issue (ii). Presumably there were a few extra copies of this sheet and it was economically held over to assist in making up the second issue. Sheet G contains on sig. G1 a pagination variant, the leaf being numbered 37 and 38 instead of the 41-42 found in all other copies of both impressions. Apparently when the formes were being readied for the second impression the printer noticed the gap between page 36 on sig. F4 v and 41 on G1 r and essayed to bridge it to indicate to the purchaser that no material was missing. Since there are no other variants on this leaf it is impossible to demonstrate whether this change was in fact made late in the run of the first forme through the press, or early as I have assumed. Whichever it was, there is some interest in the consequential change made in the opposite forme to coincide (on this slight evidence) only with the same sheets of the first forme printed with the variant pagination. Finally, there is still another variant state in the copy of issue (ii) preserved in the Ohio State University library. This is found in a rearrangement of the type in the first three lines of sig. G4 v , one of the reset pages in issue (ii). In the impression represented by issue (i) these lines had read "time to tell ye, that if you follow me quickly, you may recover the Heiress / agen. [ Speaks as out of breath . / Sir Char . Hah, — what say'st thou?" In all of the regular copies of issue (ii) in the resetting these three lines were condensed to two, reading, "time to tell ye, that if you follow me quickly, you may recover the Heiress agen. / Sir Char . Hah, — what say'st thou? [ Speak [sic] as out of Breath." In the Ohio State copy, however, although the type is that of issue (ii) the lines are arranged as three and the stage-direction reads "Speaks" as in issue (i). The position of the direction in issue (ii) is clearly wrong, since the first speaker (Cunnington) has just said "I have only now Breath and / time to tell ye . . ." and therefore the stage-direction must apply to him and not to Sir Charles. It is obvious, therefore, that the Ohio State copy represents the first state of the type on G4 v in the second impression, which reprinted that of the first impression, and that the type for these lines was not rearranged for revision (in the state represented by other copies of the second issue) but instead for some purely mechanical reason. It is most plausible to guess that the lines were reduced from three to two the better to accommodate the type-page in the opening of the skeletonforme, and in the process it was necessary to place the direction after a different line even though in error. Variants in Issue (ii) [all copies examined]: 1) CSmH (123058): added leaf with new song; G3 and I1 cancellans leaves. 2) TxU (Wrenn): G1 paged 37-38 (earliest state?). Sheet A(i *) bound with sheets B-I of issue (ii). 3) OU: G4 v , earliest and most correct state of first three lines on G4 v . Any use of standing-type, especially in connection with partial resetting, calls for explanation; and for The Richmond Heiress this is the more necessary bibliographically because of the peculiarities which are apparent in the printing of the first impression and which have a connection with peculiarities, such as the first-impression sheets B and F, in the second impression. The following hypothesis is offered in full consciousness that there still remain a few details of the printing process which seem difficult to pinpoint exactly. The date of the first performance for the Heiress is not quite certain. Nicoll assigns it to c. February, 1693; Summers and Harbage to c. March; and Day to c. April. The later date seems much to be preferred, on two counts. First, the play was advertised in The Gentleman's Journal for April, 1693 (p. 130). Second, in a letter from Dryden to Walsh dated May 9, 1693, Dryden wrote: Durfey has brought another farce upon the Stage: but his luck has left him: it was sufferd but foure dayes; and then kickd off for ever. Yet his second Act, was wonderfully diverting; where the scene was in Bedlam. . . . The rest was woefull stuff, &amp; concluded with Catcalls. . . . Since D'Urfey's dedication in the quarto (in which he speaks of the play's failure) is dated May 6, it is very likely that the play was first produced in late April or the first few days of May. In spite of Dryden's prognostication that the farce was "kickd off for ever," the Heiress was revived the following November and apparently then with some success. As previously noticed, The Gentleman's Journal for November, 1693 (p. 374), writes that the play "has been Revis'd, and Acted several times, with Alterations and Amendments." 6 It seems clear from the way in which many Restoration play quartos were hurriedly printed in two or more sections simultaneously that the first appearance in print ordinarily coincided closely with the date of initial performance, and there is some reason to suspect that authors liked to have copies available for the third, or author's, night of the play. Thus Briscoe, it is almost certain, would have started to print the play shortly before its first night. On the evidence detailed above that sheets B and F were simultaneously printed on two presses, we may suppose that they represent sheets run off in anticipation of an edition of normal size for a successful play. Only on this assumption can we explain the fact that enough copies of these sheets were machined to serve for the second impression without reprinting. It seems legitimate to assume, further, on the basis of the evidence that when the catcalls of the first-night reception 7 demonstrated that the play was doomed to failure, Briscoe reduced the size of his edition-sheet beginning with sheets C and G and put out his first issue in a relatively limited quantity. However, failure on the stage, it would be possible to argue, need not necessarily mean failure with the reading public. Moreover, D'Urfey was a successful dramatist and may have laid almost immediate plans for revisions in the hope of a revival after the turmoil had subsided. Thus it seems that Briscoe decided, or was persuaded, to keep the type standing in anticipation of a possible further demand in the future which would justify the inconvenience in view of the money to be saved if a second edition were called for. Here the resetting of two pages in sheet D and of one page and a portion of another in sheet G assumes a new significance, for the position of this resetting argues for deliberate and mechanical distribution of the original type after the first impression rather than an accident to type-pages in storage. If this is so, sheet D (the third of the first section) and sheet G (the second of the second section) were probably run off very close to each other in point of time and had begun to be distributed before Briscoe decided to keep any of his type standing for a possible later impression. The date of the second re-impressed issue is uncertain but may be placed either before the November revival as a consequence of a reading demand for the play or else, more probably, in close connection with the revival itself, probably coincidental with it. That Briscoe was not aware of the changed text which marked the revival is shown by the fact that no authorial changes were made in his standing type. Presumably after the later relative success of the play, a few remaining copies were brought up to date by the cancellation of leaves G3 and I1 to provide some portion of D'Urfey's revisions, as well as the addition of a new song, as represented, among the copies examined or reported for this study only in the unique Huntington exemplum. If this hypothesis is reasonably accurate, it would seem, then, that Briscoe kept his type standing from early May to November. The main outlines of this reconstruction do not seem to be controversial and they may roughly represent the facts in all probability. The problems raised by the anomalous evidence for the printing of the first impression may now be surveyed with somewhat more speculation. It will be recalled that a spelling test shows little doubt that sheets B-E (and probably A) were set by one compositor, this comprising the first section of the book. In the second section sheet G and H were clearly set by the same workman; but sheet F, although in general showing his characteristics, is not quite so uniform, and sheet I is rather mixed. Within each section bibliographical evidence suggests some lack of continuity in typesetting and also in printing. Thus whereas sheets B and C employ the same font of type and the same printer's measure, and utilize the same font for the pagination in the headline, sheets D and E coincide in a different font for the pagination, and in a different printer's measure (126-127 mm. as against 119-120 mm. for B-C), and differ only in the font for the text, which is slightly larger in sheet D than that employed in sheets B, C, and E. Correspondingly, sheet F in the second section is unique in its treatment of setting off stage-directions by parentheses instead of square brackets, in the small size of its headline pagination, in the longer printer's measure (125-126 mm. versus 122-123 for G-H, and 121-122 for I) and in the slightly larger size of the font used for the text. Sheet I differs in its use of square brackets instead of parentheses about the headline pagination; and though its font seems to be the same as that in sheets G and H, its measure is slightly narrower. When we put all these facts together we may conjecture that in the original impression sheet F was started somewhat later than sheet B. The break that exists between sheets C and D, and between F and G, suggests that when Briscoe was apprised of the play's failure sheet F was on the press at the same time as either the last of sheet B or the early pulls of the first forme of sheet C. At any rate, the compositor of the first section was far enough in advance of the second-section workman to have completed his setting of sheet C, but the second compositor had not, for some reason, begun to set G. Thus the simultaneous break in the typesetting after C and F may further suggest that for a short time Briscoe suspended work on the play, possibly with a view to cutting his losses at that point by giving up publication. He then, seemingly, changed his mind, and began again by machining sheet C in a reduced edition-sheet (from the type already set) and starting fresh composition with sheets D and G. 8 If this is so, the irregular sheet I is explicable as the work of a third compositor and press, since the first press would be working on sheet A when the second was engaged with sheet H, and to complete the play most expeditiously some extra assistance was required in the second section. The only irregularity remaining is the shift in sheet E back to the font of type used in sheets B and C instead of the slightly larger font employed for sheet D when setting was resumed. This is mere guesswork, but it may not be unreasonable to conjecture that since sheet E had to join with the text for sheet F, long since printed, the inadvertent choice of type for sheet D was corrected in order to set more text, as was necessary, in sheet E. 9</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Variant Forms of Fielding's Coffee-House Politician Jeanne Addison Masengill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An attempt to trace the publication history of Henry Fielding's early play, The Coffee-House Politician, raises a number of interesting questions, some of which may be answered with a degree of assurance although some remain puzzling. W. L. Cross lists in his bibliography 1 two editions of the play, one on June 23, 1730, under the title Rape Upon Rape, and a second, as The Coffee-House Politician, with variant Epilogue, on December 17, 1730. Allardyce Nicoll also mentions two versions and tells us that the play was performed in the fall "with an entire new act." 2 The Monthly Chronicle for 1730 supports Cross in listing Rape Upon Rape in June and The Coffee-House Politician for December; 3 but Winston, in the Folger Shakespeare Library copy of the Winston MSS., 4 has a note beside the June 23 performance of Rape Upon Rape to the effect that it has been "previously published," although for this I find no support. Finally Herman R. Mead notes the existence of three variant forms to be found in the Huntington Library. 5 Comparison of a number of copies of the play, all London 1730, has led me to the conclusion that it exists actually in only one edition, that the edition has three issues, and that the third issue exists in two states. The forms may be distinguished as follows: (i) Rape upon Rape; | OR, THE | JUSTICE | Caught in his own TRAP. | A | COMEDY. | As it is Acted at the | Theatre in the Hay-Market . | [rule] | [ornament] | [double rule] | LONDON : | Printed for J.

(iii b ) Like (iii a ) except A4 v , which has Lincoln's-Inn-Fields Cast, but: Worthy, Mr. Ogden ; Politick, Mr. Chapman ; Constant, Mr. Milward ; Hilaret, Mrs. Younger ; Isabella, Mrs. Boheme . The rest of the cast is the same as in (iii a ). Copies: CtY, MH. Apparently in all these states, 7 the collation is identical for B-F 8 . The only exceptions I have found are a different ornament at the top of B1 in the DLC copy of (iii a ), quite possibly a press variant, and the lack of F8 in this copy and perhaps in others. I have, in fact, found no evidence to contradict the conclusion that the gatherings B-F are all the product of a single typesetting. All agree in the running-title, Rape upon Rape; Or, | The Justice caught in his own Trap., and the pagination and type alignment are the same in each. There are a number of uncorrected errors in the texts: "Goal" for "Gaol", p. 71; "Teasure" for "Treasure", p. 75, etc.; and all share many notable peculiarities in type: "Scene V1II", p. 36, etc. Even the running-titles, signatures, and catchwords agree in relative positions and other peculiarities. ("Bamb." for "Ramb.", p. 19, c.w.; "Ra" of running-title markedly slanted, p. 66, etc.) We may conclude, then, that we have to deal actually with only one edition of the play. If there really was "an entire new act," it seems never to have gotten into the printed text; and the truth may be either that the revived play was misrepresented in its advertisements, (Winston's note says "rev. by Author.") or that Nicoll was misled by the rewritten epilogue, which is included in the new performances and the later issues. Since the typesetting is the same for gatherings B-F in the spring and fall issues of the play, we must conclude either that the type itself was kept standing all summer for a reimpression, or that a number of sheets printed in the spring were kept over the summer as remainders. The latter is obviously the simpler and more probable hypothesis, and there is some evidence to support it. For one thing, the play almost certainly had a disappointing sale. The printer had every reason to believe that the edition would be a success—it had a provocative title, and it was Fielding's fourth dramatic production of the season. The other three had all done well: The Temple Beau had run a respectable thirteen nights, and The Author's Farce and Tom Thumb had been tremendously popular, the one going through two and the other through three editions in the course of the year. But Rape Upon Rape opened very late, played only seven nights in the season, and according to Winston's notes had only fair box-office receipts. Therefore, Watts probably was left with unsold sheets on his hands and almost certainly would not have kept his type tied up for the summer in a not-too-promising play. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that there are no signs of a re-impression: even the running-titles, signatures, and catchwords are not reset in the fall issues, though they would almost surely have been removed if the type had been kept standing, and indeed were removed in the first gathering where there are signs of standing type. We may, then, advance the theory that gatherings B-F represent a single impression of a single type-setting. In the first gathering, however, the problem is more complex. Notwithstanding the various changes noted above, the same basic typesetting is present in each version. Thus the prologue, A2 and A2 v , is the same typesetting throughout although (iii a ) and (iii b ) have corrections in ll. 15 and 16, and the head and tail ornaments, initial, signature, and the word "Prologue" have clearly been reset. Even in the rewritten epilogue, A3 and A3 v , the passages which have been retained in (iii a ) and (iii b ) are in the same setting as the corresponding passages in (i) and (ii), though again the ornaments and the word "Epilogue" are reset. A4 in (i) and (ii) is the same setting of the advertisement; and (iii a ) and (iii b ) similarly agree. On A4 v , (iii a ) and (iii b ) have the same setting of the dramatis personae, with the noted changes; but the whole page is a different setting from that shared by (i) and (ii). The determination of the order and the exact relationship of these forms depends to some extent on establishing the stage history of the play. Winston, Nicoll, and Cross agree that the play opened as Rape Upon Rape at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket on June 23. After the summer vacation, it played one more night in the Haymarket, on November 27, as The Coffee-House Politician . Then, for some reason, the play was moved to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, where it was given on December 4, 5, 7, and 17. Genest 8 and Cross 9 state that Mrs. Younger took the role of Hilaret on December 4, and Winston specifies that Mrs. Boheme was Isabella. Cross even adds that the epilogue was probably revised at the request of Mrs. Younger although he offers no proof and we may note that the old epilogue, beginning, RAPE upon Rape! what Author ever chose A name so sure to make the Fair his Foes! loses its point once the title has been changed. In any case, the new epilogue was clearly intended to be spoken by some character in the play, probably Hilaret, for it begins, At length the dreadful Hurricane is ended, And I and Spouse are safe together landed . Genest lists Mr. Milward as Constant, and the prologue would fittingly have been spoken by him. None of the authorities mentioned discusses any change in the original Lincoln's-Inn-Fields cast, but the variant A4 v of (iii b ) suggests that changes were made at some point in the progress of the production. In view of the stage history, the evidence of the advertisements in A4, and those in the periodicals referred to by Cross, 10 there is no reason to doubt that Rape Upon Rape (i) was actually the first issue of the play and that it appeared on June 23. Since all the other forms have the new title, and Lincoln's-Inn-Fields on the title-page, we may add that (i) was the issue brought out in the spring of 1730. We may then suppose that Watts kept a fairly large number of already printed copies of gatherings B-F, and some printed copies of the first gathering. We are forced to the conclusion that he kept as well the type for the first gathering since this theory explains most satisfactorily the recurrence of the same typesetting with new headings and signature and internal revisions in (iii a ) and (iii b ). The position of (ii) is somewhat doubtful since the unique copy of this state, in the Kemble-Devonshire collection, has inlaid leaves so that it is now impossible to draw any conclusion about the conjugacy of the leaves. This could be a "made-up" copy, but since it has a genuinely variant title-page, I have accepted it as the second issue. If this is correct, (ii) was probably brought out very soon after the fall opening—possibly as a stop-gap to meet a demand created by the one Haymarket performance. The title-page was most likely a cancel prefixed to old sheets of the first gathering and bound without regard for the fact that it joined a Lincoln's-Inn-Fields title-page with a Haymarket cast and an epilogue related to the old title. Only a few copies of the second issue were apparently sold, and it is reasonable to suppose that the third issue, with reset title-page, corrected prologue, revised epilogue, and Lincoln's-Inn-Fields cast, was in preparation at the time of the Lincoln's-Inn-Fields rehearsals. According to the usual practice, it would have appeared on or about December 4, the day of the new opening. That this was what actually did happen is indicated by advertisements, not listed by Cross, in the London Evening-Post . Its issue for December 1-3 announces "Tomorrow will be published" The Coffee-House Politician , and the one for December 3-5 follows up with the information that it is "Published Today." We may, therefore, conclude with reasonable assurance that the new issue did appear early in December. The issue exists, however, in two states. Both have the same basic typesetting as (i) and (ii), and yet contain changes on every leaf of the initial sheet; hence, we must suppose that the whole first gathering was reprinted from the modified standing type. The only remaining problem is the determination of which is the earlier of the two states. The solution hinges on the cast of characters on A4 v as this is the only place in which the two states do not agree. If we accept the statements that Mrs. Younger was Hilaret when the play opened on December 4, we are tempted to theorize that (iii b ), the state which contains her name in the cast and as speaker of the epilogue, is the earlier form. We might complete this theory by suggesting that some time after December 4, perhaps in the interim between the seventh and the seventeenth, the cast was changed. Watts might then have corrected the cast, neglecting to replace Mrs. Younger's name on A3, and have brought out the second state about December 17, the date suggested by Cross for the "second edition." But this hypothesis has certain difficulties. The simplest method of making the change in cast would have been by the canceling of A4. But none of the copies of (iii a ) which I have seen or had described shows any clear signs of cancellation. 11 If Watts did not cancel, he must have reprinted the whole gathering, and if so, being a careful printer, why did he not replace Mrs. Younger's name on A3? He might have canceled by removing the conjugate leaves A1 and A4 after the edges had been trimmed and replacing them with corrected leaves; but, if this were the case, one would expect to find some evidence in the failure of the chain lines of the new leaves to coincide exactly with those of the old. Also, in order to imagine a reprinting of the A1 and A4 leaves, or even of just A4 as it occurs in (iii a ), we must concede that Watts kept the type of the gathering standing for some two weeks and kept it, not as he had kept it before, with headlines, etc. removed, but just as it had been used for (iii b ). Finally, and most improbably, this theory allows the supposition that the greatest number of copies were printed and sold, not when the play opened, but on December 17, when after a single performance, the demand ceased altogether. 12 On the whole, an alternative hypothesis seems more satisfactory. Let us suppose that there was no change in the cast after the actual opening of the play. The listing in (iii a ) may be taken to represent rather a provisional casting given to Watts when the Lincoln's-Inn-Fields rehearsals began. He may then have proceeded to change his standing type where necessary and prepare for printing everything except the revised epilogue which he had to get from Fielding himself. It is possible that by the time the epilogue was completed there had been changes made in the cast: in particular, that Mrs. Younger had been substituted for Mrs. Boheme in the role of Hilaret. Fielding accordingly would have supplied her name as the speaker of the epilogue. A3 and A3 v would then have been set in their final form; and the printing would have begun. At some time—either during this printing process, or between December 4 and 17, someone familiar with the cast noted that the listing on A4 v had not been changed, and hence the necessary corrections were made. Yet the same objections as before may be made against conjecturing a second printing later in December. In addition, there would not now be even the occasion of a modified production; and it seems unlikely that Watts would have bothered to correct such a relatively minor error after a large number of copies had already been issued and after it must have become fairly obvious that the play was not destined for a long run. The simplest conclusion, therefore, and the one I wish to present, is that A4 v was corrected during the course of the printing of the December 4 issue. It is true that this printing would not have occupied more than four or five hours; but if Fielding was on hand to proof-read his revised epilogue, he himself could easily have called for the alteration of A4 v to agree with the scheduled opening-night cast. The error would probably not have been considered sufficiently grave to deter the use of the already printed copies (iii a ), probably most of the issue. Whatever the actual situation was, the weight of the argument seems to favor the classification of (iii a ) as the first state and (iii b ) as the second. The analysis of the variant forms of the play indicates, then, three issues: (i) represents the first, on June 23; (ii) is the second, probably very late in November; (iii a ) and (iii b ) are respectively the first and second states of the third issue, on December 4. Judging from the number of extant copies, the final issue sold considerably better than the first two; but the play was doomed. Lincoln's-Inn-Fields closed for the Christmas vacation, and The Coffee-House Politician did not survive the year.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Case of the Planters of Tobacco in Virginia, 1733: An Extraordinary Use of Standing Type Oliver L. Steele, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the McGregor Collection of the University of Virginia Library are two tracts concerning colonial tobacco trade. A study of the relationship existing between the tracts illustrates a printing practice which, so far as I have been able to learn, has not been previously recorded. 1 One of the tracts was printed as a folio sheet, with the following undated title-page: 2 The CASE of the Planters of | Tobacco in Virginia , as re-|preſented by themſelves, ſign-|ed by the Preſident of the | Council and the Speaker of the | Houſe of Burgeſſes. The other tract was printed as an octavo in fours; its dated title-page reads as follows: 3 THE | CASE | OF THE | Planters of TOBACCO | in Virginia , | As repreſented by Themselves; | ſigned by the Preſident of the | Council, and Speaker of the Houſe of Burgeſſes. | To which is added, | A VINDICATION | of the ſaid Repreſentation. | [double rule] | LONDON : | Printed for J. Roberts in Warwick-Lane | 1733. Price 1 s. As the titles suggest, the texts of the two tracts are, in part, the same. In fact, a collation of the two copies reveals that, save for titles, catchwords, and the Vindication which appears only in the 8 , the text of one of the copies is a letter for letter, point for point reprint of that of the other. There are no variants in either the substantives or the accidentals of the text of the two formats. This complete absence of variation suggests that one of the formats was printed from the standing type of the other, even though their line-length is completely dissimilar; and an examination and collation of defective type and misprints occurring in the two copies proves that such was indeed the case. Of course, there are apparent defects in the sorts of one copy which do not appear in the sorts in the corresponding positions of the other copy. However the many examples of defective type common to the tract in both formats make it most likely that variation is only apparent and was the result, on the one hand, of light inking and, on the other, of heavy inking. Of the ninety or so obvious type defects common to the tract in both formats, the following is a list of those defects which seem most significant. The first reference is to the folio; the reference within parentheses is to the octavo. p. 1, line 4. the Industry (A2, line 8) Spurs, evidently the result of faulty casting, print as small dots in the eye of the e of the . p. 1, line 6. Progress of that (A2, line 13) The tail of the first t of that is bent so that it forms an obtuse angle with the vertical stroke. p. 1, line 29. Warehouſes (A3, line 11) There is a very noticeable break in the curve of the long s. p. 2, line 19. Affairs (A4, line 29) There is a break in the left leg of the A immediately above the conjunction of the leg and the bar. p. 2, line 37. Manner (A4 v , line 30) The serif at the top of the vertical stroke of the first n is broken off. There is a nick slightly above the base of the vertical stroke of the first n. p. 3, line 4. Debts (B1 v , line 23) The s is turned. p. 3, line 11. Draught (B2, line 1) There is a break in the lower curve of the D. p. 3, line 37. allowed (B2 v , line 7) In the a , the upper hairline of the bowl is almost completely broken away. p. 3, line 55. will have (B3, line 7) The tail of the e in have is bent up perpendicular to the horizontal bar enclosing the eye. These examples present convincing proof that standing type of one format was rearranged and used exclusively in printing the text of the other format. Which of the formats was first through the press is a matter of some interest. The Vindication mentions a text of the Case which ". . . has been long talked of about the Royal Exchange . . ." (sig. C2), and it is natural to assume that the reference is to the folio sheet. However, Arents Catalogue lists the 8° as a first edition, and, as the folio sheet is undated, there is no proof, only a general probability, that this listing is wrong. That the listing is in fact incorrect, and that the Case as printed in the 8° is a second issue (re-imposed and re-impressed) of the text printed in the folio sheet, can be established. In the lack of any variant readings, the clearest and the only unambiguous evidence 4 as to the order of the issues is what may be called the awkward spacing occasionally found in the 8° as compared with the consistently regular spacing of the folio. 5 Roberts or his compositor seems regularly to have attempted to split the folio lines, the measure for which was 148 mm., in half in rearranging them for the 8°, which was set in a measure of 75 mm. 6 Very often he was unable to do this and, in order to justify lines, was forced to remove or to add spaces. In the majority of cases he changed the original spacing without any very unsightly result, but in a few instances the result is manifestly unsightly. Following are three of the most obvious examples of awkward spacing in the 8°: Folio Octavo p. 1, line 40. End of Eighteen End (1 mm.) of of(2) Eighteen A3, line 28. End (3 mm.)of &gt; of(3)Eighteen p. 3, line 24. the Duties was the (1) Duties Duties (1.5) was B2, line 27. the(2.5)Duties Duties (3) was line 34. seeing upon the Merchants seeing(1) upon upon(1) the the(1)Merchants B2 v , line 13. seeing(2)upon upon(3)the the(2)Merchants The awkward spacing found in the 8° establishes the order of the two issues. The text of the Case printed in 8° is not the first edition but a separate, second issue of the folio text. It would be interesting to know how long the type used in printing the folio sheet was kept standing before the printing of the 8°, but that I have not been able to discover. However, from extant sources I have inferred a history which is admittedly conjectural, though not, I think, illogical. On June 28, 1732, John Randolph was appointed by the House to present before parliament a petition pleading the case of the Virginia planters. 7 He left Virginia soon after August 8, 1732, 8 and reached England in late November or early December. Soon after he was settled in London he gave the MS of the Case to Roberts, and the folio sheet was printed by late December or early January. Randolph, expecting, perhaps, that the Case would be attacked, ordered Roberts to keep the type standing. The folio Case was ". . . long talked of about the Royal Exchange . . .", and attacks against it did appear in print. 9 Sometime after March 2, 1733, Randolph finished his Vindication 10 of the Case and gave it to Roberts. Roberts decided upon the format to be used in printing the Vindication and began reimposing the standing type from the folio Case while setting the Vindication . Thus the type of the folio sheet was kept standing over two months before the second issue was printed. The chief interest in this octavo, however, lies not merely in the fact that it employed standing type in another format but that this standing type was broken up and completely rearranged to adjust it to a smaller type-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am indebted to Professor Fredson Bowers for directing my attention to this problem and for suggesting some of the tests used in the investigation. I wish also to thank Mr. John Wyllie, Curator of Rare Books at the University of Virginia Library, for his kind help. 2 The folio sheet has no formal title-page; the transcript is from the title printed on the lower half of p. 4. Evidently the sheet was sold folded as a quarto. A complete bibliographical description seems unnecessary. For further information see Sabin, vol. XXVII, nos. 99909, 99910. This tract should not be confused with another folio sheet, The Case of the Tobacco Planters in His Majesty's Colony of Virginia, as to the Bill now depending in the House of Lords . . . . (Torrence, pt. 1, p. 106, no. 120), which was printed earlier than the Case , cf. Case , sig. A2. 3 See Arents, Tobacco , vol. III, p. 233, no. 673; Sabin, vol. XXVII, no. 99911. None of the catalogues I have seen notes the relationship of the two tracts to each other. In fact, only Sabin lists both tracts. 4 One is tempted to see type deterioration in the 8°. For instance, in both copies (F., p. 2, line 12; 8°, A4, line 15.) the second h of which has a small break near the top of the vertical stroke; in the 8° there appears to be a second break in the vertical stroke. On the other hand, in the folio the upper horizontal borderline of the slot in the factotum found in both copies has a break which seems larger than that in the 8°. Whether a looser locking of the surrounding type, combined with a tighter fit of the type within the slot, would cause this is uncertain. 5 There is one glaring exception to the regularity in the folio spacing; for no apparent reason there is a space 9 mm. in length between reprefent , and The in the folio (p. 1, line 6.). The 8° compositor did not change the obvious error. 6 Of course, a compositor resetting lines 148 mm. long in a 75 mm. measure would occasionally achieve an exact 2/1 ratio even if he reset word by word. But I believe that Roberts' compositor tried to break the folio lines in half and fit them in their new measure without otherwise disturbing the type. His failure to correct the spacing error noted in fn. 5 is the best evidence of the 8° compositor's unwillingness to disturb the folio lines. 7 Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1727-1734 , ed., H.

      <field name="heading_text">Baskerville and James Whatman A. T. Hazen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In discussions of Baskerville's innovations, the use of wove paper is often cited, along with his blacker ink, hot-pressed sheets, and new types; and he is therefore often credited with the manufacture of the first wove paper. The difficulty began in his own time, for Dr. John Bedford of Durham wrote, 29 October 1758: "By Baskerville's Specimen of his types, you will perceive how much the elegance of them is owing to his paper, which he makes himself" (Nichols, Illustrations , I, 813). Similarly, Samuel Derrick wrote in 1760 that Baskerville manufactured his own paper. So it is not astonishing, perhaps, that the Vergil of 1757 has ever since been called, in numerous handbooks, the first book on wove paper, and Baskerville is credited either categorically or doubtfully with the invention: he is so acclaimed in a standard encyclopedia revised in 1950. To some extent Baskerville himself is to blame for the error. The Vergil was advertised as to be "on a very fine writing Royal paper," and in his Preface to the Milton of 1758 Baskerville spoke of "the improvement in the manufacture of the paper" used for the Vergil. Even more dangerous, perhaps, was his letter to Dodsley in 1756 concerning "the paper scheme," in which he proposed to send samples to the Prince of Wales "as a sample of English manufactory"; and in advertisements as well as in his Proposals for Milton he offered writing paper "of his own manufacture." But in these latter references, as the punctuation indeed suggests, Baskerville was certainly speaking of his novelty, ornamented writing papers, and perhaps also of his new process of glazing and hot-pressing. The two references to the paper of his Vergil are to be understood as expressing his satisfaction in the new paper he was using, not a claim for its manufacture. Baskerville said nothing of the paper when he wrote to Dodsley in 1752 concerning his care about punches, printing press, ink, and printing; and in his appeal to Horace Walpole in November 1762 he added a postscript: "The ink, presses, chases, moulds for casting, and all the apparatus for printing were made in my own shops." Clearly, Baskerville never said he manufactured the new wove paper or any other paper, whatever practical interest he may have had in the improvement of paper manufacture. If Baskerville did not manufacture, or invent, the first wove paper, however, it is of some interest to know who did. Baskerville was conscious of the effect of the paper in setting off his new types—hence his calendering of the fresh-printed sheets—and we may fairly assume he used the new wove paper purposefully but experimentally. No paper-maker is known who would seem more likely to have invented wove paper than James Whatman, the man who lifted English paper-making from obscurity to pre-eminence. His association with Baskerville and with early wove paper seems sufficient to suggest that he (and his son) did in fact develop the first wove paper. The art of making woven wire does not seem in itself to be the important technical accomplishment, although it is the prerequisite. But its application to the art of paper-making, as a way to eradicate the irregularity caused by chain-lines, must have proved difficult: not only do the first specimens in England show an imperfect fusion with the established method of parallel laid wires, but twenty years later (after Franklin in 1777 exhibited specimens of English wove in Paris) Johannot and Montgolfier did not succeed in producing a satisfactory wove or papier vélin for two or three years. The association between Whatman and Baskerville has to be traced through William Shenstone and Dodsley, but it is nevertheless exactly demonstrable; and because of the proposed new bibliography of Baskerville, this association may well be stressed now. Shenstone wrote, 7 March 1757: "My neighbor Baskerville, at the close of this month, publishes his fine edition of Vergil. It will, for paper and type , be a perfect curiosity." Then Shenstone wrote to Percy, 11 August 1760: "Have you ever yet seen the Prolusions? [completed by Dryden Leach in October 1759, but delayed in publication] . . .'Tis indeed a specimen of type and paper that is meant to alarm my neighbor Baskerville. . . . However, Tonson [publisher of Milton as well as of Capell's Prolusions ] having sent it to Baskerville, is to find it surpassed in Dodsley's Fables ." The Vergil of 1757 is partly on a new paper perhaps made by placing woven wire or a stiff cloth screen on a conventional mould, since it is in effect an unwatermarked wove paper but shows translucent chain-lines. The second part and the cancels are on an excellent, unwatermarked laid paper with closely spaced chain-lines. But Capell's Prolusions is printed on a completely satisfying wove paper, watermarked some half-inch from the edge with a small block W, a paper fully as good as that in the Vergil but not hot-pressed. 1 And we know from a letter of James Whatman the Younger, in 1768, that he made the paper for the Prolusions: he says that Crown No. 2 is the common size, "and is made upon wove moulds and is the same sort of paper I made for Mr. Caples Prolusions." (Quoted by James Wardrop in Signature No. 9, 1938, from a transcript in the BM.) Prolusions is therefore on wove paper manufactured by Whatman, and we know that Shenstone was very favorably impressed by the new papers used in the Vergil and in Prolusions . In the autumn of 1759 Dodsley planned the printing of his Selected Fables of Aesop , during discussions with Shenstone and Baskerville. Then in June 1760 Dodsley wrote about the Fables to Shenstone: "I hope that Mr. Baskerville will be quite ready for me; I shall send him the paper in a fortnight." And when the book was completed, Baskerville advertised it as on superfine paper; it was published in February 1761, "price bound five shillings"—on the same wove paper, watermarked W near the edge, that Whatman had made for Capell's Prolusions . (Mr. Wardrop noted the paper of the Aesop in his article in Signature .) Now it is true that Dodsley's selection of a wove paper made by Whatman, in 1760, on which Baskerville was to print his Aesop's Fables , does not exactly prove Whatman to be the originator. But it does link Whatman very firmly to Baskerville in connection with one book, and no other source of Baskerville's supply has ever been established. Furthermore, since Whatman had the same paper available for Capell's Prolusions in 1759, Whatman is clearly proved to be the first maker of wove paper save for the unidentified maker of the experimental wove used for the first part of the Vergil. Perhaps there is some pattern to the other papers used by Baskerville in books of about the same period. Most of the books printed in the early years are on good laid paper, sometimes without watermarks, sometimes with marks that can not be assigned to one mill. The Juvenal of 1761, in quarto, is on laid paper much like that used in the second part of the Vergil, a good laid with chain-lines rather closely spaced, without watermark; it is presumably paper from the same mill. The octavo Milton of 1758, printed by Baskerville for Tonson who published Capell's Prolusions , and the earlier Proposals for Milton are on very similar paper: it has the same closely spaced chain-lines (about ¾"); but it was not glazed and calendered like the Vergil, so that it seems a little heavier and less translucent; again, it seems likely to have come from the same mill. The octavo Milton of 1760 is less interesting, chiefly because the chain-lines are more normally spaced. The Horace of 1762, in duodecimo, is on a fine unwatermarked paper with chain-lines still more closely spaced (the cancels, however, are on rather ordinary paper of the period); and if this paper came from Whatman or another English maker, that used in Aesop's Fables of 1764 becomes an apparent attempt in Holland to imitate it. This second Baskerville edition of Aesop's Fables has chain-lines very closely spaced (about ½"), and the watermark is a post-horn, Superfine, and countermark Amsterdam. Other books are on the whole rather less interesting. Two quartos, Gardiner and Dalby, printed in 1762, are on trade demy paper: lily watermark, with IV countermark. The 1758 Avon , in quarto, is similar. The Book of Psalms, 1762, in duodecimo, has a normal lily in shield, LVG, with IV countermark. These could be imported Dutch paper, or English paper using the standard marks. Much the same is true of the Addison and Congreve, 1761. But Edwin and Emma , 1760, in quarto, has (one sheet in one copy, both sheets in another) the watermark lily, Strasburg bend, LVG, with countermark (I think) JW. The initials are in the binding, but this is almost certainly the same Whatman laid paper that appears in other royal quartos of that date—the best laid paper on the market. The reprint of the Vergil, customarily dated ca. 1771, is on an apparent wove paper that is not especially good; the wire-lines and chain-lines are rather dim, so that it passes for wove paper. This can hardly be ascribed to Whatman: it is not at all as satisfactory as the Aesop's Fables of 1761, or even the Vergil of 1757. One other book is of interest, though, the quarto Paradise Regained of 1759: this is an excellent and undoubted wove, very much like that in Capell's Prolusions save that I find no watermark in Paradise Regained . The pattern of these few books is perhaps this: various books printed on good paper as it became available, with a sharp eye out for the typographical effectiveness of an experimental new paper. The Vergil begun on the experimental paper in which the chain-lines were nearly obliterated by the use of woven wire; Paradise Regained of 1759 on a much more satisfactory wove; the latter half of Vergil and most of Tonson's Miltons on a fine laid with experimentally narrow chain-lines; and Aesop's Fables on a fine Whatman wove supplied by Dodsley. Only the paper used in Aesop's Fables and in Capell's Prolusions is demonstrably Whatman's wove; and yet there is a demonstrable association between Whatman and Baskerville by way of Tonson, Dodsley, and Shenstone. If I were seeking for the originator of wove paper for Western Europe, a quarter of a century before Johannot and Montgolfier learned to make wove at Annonay, I would begin by studying the products of the Whatman mill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In the similar wove paper used for the 1764 Caslon Specimen printed by Dryden Leach, Whatman placed his initials JW in the middle of one-half of the sheet. Presumably this was the book that Didot says he examined in Paris in 1779.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Edition of Essays by Mr. Goldsmith, 1765 Arthur Friedman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is well known that there are two editions of Oliver Goldsmith's Essays dated 1765, both said in the imprint to be "for W. Griffin": one with an engraved titlepage (1765A); 1 the other a cheaper edition with a title-page printed from type (1765B). 2 No careful attempt has been made to determine which of these editions is the first. In his bibliography of first editions of Goldsmith's writings Iolo A. Williams describes 1765A and does not mention the other edition. 3 Temple Scott, on the other hand, describes both editions and argues for the priority of 1765B: I lean to the conclusion that the issue [i.e., edition] of this book without the engraved title-page is the first issue, because most of the editions which followed it have the engraved title. It is more likely that the publisher, had he used an engraved title originally, would have continued to use it rather than abandon it and reset the volume in a poorer form. The demand for the book encouraged Griffin to make a more pleasing volume, hence the improved type-setting and engraved title-page of the later issue. 4 This argument is by no means conclusive. Although it is remarkable that 1765B, if it is the later edition, has a printed title-page, various reasons might be suggested why the title-page plate engraved for 1765A could have been inaccessible when another edition was printed. More important, Scott's last sentence states the reverse of what I take to be the normal procedure; Griffin might rather be expected to make the first edition attractive in appearance in order to create a demand and then possibly to take advantage of the demand with a cheaper edition. A direct comparison of the texts of 1765A and 1765B leads to no demonstrable conclusion for one or the other as the first edition. Fortunately, however, the problem of priority is readily solvable by comparing the two editions with an earlier state of the text. As is suggested by the motto "Collecta revirescunt" on the title-page of the Essays , Goldsmith was republishing essays and poems which he had previously contributed to newspapers and periodicals, and the original texts are available for all but the last of the twenty-seven pieces. For the collected Essays Goldsmith made very extensive revisions, which appear in both 1765A and 1765B; the two editions are clearly not independent reprintings of the periodical texts. One of the editions, consequently, was printed from the revised periodical texts, whereas the other was derived from this first edition; 5 and the order of the editions can be determined by discovering which one is closer to the periodical texts. I attempt to list below all the variants in substantives where one of the 1765 texts agrees with the periodical version and the other differs from it. Page and line (from 1765A) Bee 1765A 1765B 1.16 at a loss at a loss at loss 4.20 extraordinary pages extraordinary pages pages extraordinary 6.22 am am I am 37.17 [No paragraph division] [No paragraph division] [Paragraph division] 72.18 possible a possible a possible that a 75.17 for Sundays for Sundays for Sunday 121.16 on a string on a string in a string 123.18 and and and, and and, Lloyd's Evening Post 29.7 vainly vainly in vain Citizen of the World 6 91.22 the joke sake the joke sake the joke's sake 95.12 an hundred an hundred a hundred 112.6 greater efforts greater efforts great efforts Royal Magazine 131.7 habitation habitation inhabitation 131.14 ingratitude ingratitude gratitude 132.9 over our heads over our heads above our heads 135.6 we have no we have no we no 137.3 put it into put it into put into Public Ledger 7 149.5 They have all They have all They all have British Magazine 166.4 came upon them came upon them came in upon them 167.24 one of his legs were one of his legs were one of his legs was 168.10 made a bishop made a bishop made bishop 170.2 heard heard had heard 187.17 fondlings foundlings fondlings 192.6 those two months those two months those months 197.5 [No paragraph division] [No paragraph division] [Paragraph division] 199.11 of Europe of Europe in Europe 215.10 sailors and soldiers sailors and soldiers soldiers and sailors Weekly Magazine 227.23 where were where From this collation 1765A is seen to be very much closer to the periodical texts than is 1765B. 1765B agrees with the earlier texts against 1765A in only two cases: in one instance (227.23) the reading of 1765A is a simple misprint, and in the other (187.17) it appears on critical grounds to be inferior to the reading of the British Magazine and 1765B. 1765A, on the other hand, agrees with the periodical texts twenty-six times when 1765B differs from them. Of these distinctive readings in 1765B three (121.16, 131.14, and 135.6) are obvious errors, and three others (112.6, 131.7, and 137.3) seem on critical grounds to be inferior readings. The other twenty instances, however, are all indifferent readings not clearly inferior to 1765A; indeed a number of them—the correction of grammar at 167.24, for example—appear to be attempts at obvious improvement. In these twenty cases it is highly improbable that either Goldsmith or a printer would have returned in 1765A from the readings of 1765B to those of the periodical texts; it is very much more probable that 1765A is the first ediiton and that 1765B represents a stage of the text still further removed from the periodical version. 8 When 1765A is recognized as the first edition, 1765B is seen to contain a number of features that call for explanation. (1) It is not described as the second edition; rather the edition of 1766 is called on the title-page "The SECOND EDITION, corrected." (2) No new edition, as far as I have been able to discover, was advertised in the newspapers during 1765. 9 (3) The printer of 1765B did not employ the title-page plate engraved for 1765A or even the picture cut from that plate and used as a vignette in 1766. (4) 1766 bears a close physical resemblance to 1765A; it is, indeed, as far as corrections and additions permitted, a page-for-page reprint of the first edition. 1765B, on the other hand, is not a paginal reprint; it is, rather, a cheap reprint which does not attempt to imitate the physical make-up of 1765A. (5) 1765A has at the end a leaf advertising nine books printed and sold by W. Griffin; 1766 advertises these same books and fourteen others. 1765B carries no advertisements. It is apparent that 1765A and 1766 display a sequence in the practices of Griffin and that the supposedly intermediate 1765B departs from this sequence. The only thing associating Griffin with 1765B is his name on the title-page, and the five features listed above taken in combination strongly suggest that he was not responsible for its publication. If 1765B is in fact a piracy, then (1) there would have been no reason for calling it the second edition, whereas Griffin would naturally have given that designation to 1766; (2) the only result of advertising 1765B as a new edition would have been to call the piracy to Griffin's attention; (3) the engraved title-page plate for 1765A or the picture cut from that plate and used as a vignette for 1766 would not have been available to the printer of 1765B; (4) 1765B does not resemble 1765A in physical make-up because the printer wished, not to deceive people who had seen the first edition, but to produce the volume as cheaply as possible; (5) the printer would have had no interest in advertising Griffin's stock. Since 1765B can with some confidence be labelled a piracy, none of its distinctive readings—even those which are corrections or have the superficial air of improvements—can be authoritative, and therefore an editor should give no weight to its variants. Even if a less extreme view is taken, and the case for piracy is considered speculative only, an editor will find that there is no distinctive reading in 1765B which could not be a printing variant. In light of this fact, it would appear to be of considerable significance that when the authorized 1766 edition was ordered, the printer was furnished a copy of 1765A, an unlikely occurrence if the readings in 1765B resulted from the author's further revisions. Of even greater importance, Goldsmith, if he were responsible for the distinctive readings of 1765B, might be expected to repeat some of them in his fairly extensive revision of 1765A for this edition of 1766; but for the twenty-eight instances listed above where 1765A and 1765B differ, 1766 invariably agrees with 1765A. Even if the very strong evidence that 1765B is a piracy is ignored, the edition can still be granted no textual authority. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 12°, (engraved title-leaf +) A 4 B-L 12 . 2 12°, A 2 B-Q 6 R 4 . 3 Seven XVIII th Century Bibliographies (1924), p. 136. 4 Oliver Goldsmith Bibliographically and Biographically Considered (1928), p. 157. Scott's statement that "most of the editions which followed it [1765B] have the engraved title" is inaccurate. For the edition of 1766 the complete title-page plate engraved for 1765A was discarded, probably because to have used it as a whole would have necessitated not only the addition of "The SECOND EDITION, corrected" and of a Roman numeral to the date but also a change of the address of Griffin's shop from Fetter Lane to Catharine Street. The engraved picture above the imprint in the plate, however, was cut out and used alone as a vignette for the title-page of 1766; the rest of the 1766 title-page was printed from type. This correction of Scott is not intended to weaken his argument; 1765B, if it is the later edition, might be expected to have the engraved title, since the wording of the two 1765 title-pages is identical. 5 The later of the editions dated 1765 was almost certainly printed from the first edition, because there is no known edition that could have served as an intermediary; the only other recorded editions published during Goldsmith's lifetime are the edition of 1766, which contains corrections and additions that do not appear in the 1765 texts, and Dublin editions of 1767 and 1772. 6 The essays in which the variants listed below occur had originally appeared in the Public Ledger of 1760, but the 1765 text of these essays was derived from the revised version in The Citizen of the World (1762). 7 The 1765 text of Essay XVIII, in which the following variant occurs, was derived from the Public Ledger rather than from the revised version in The Citizen of the World . 8 I have listed only the substantive variants because the evidence from accidentals is less conclusive. (For an example from an earlier period of the treacherous nature of accidentals in determining priority see A. H. Carter, Studies in Philology, XLIV [1947], 497-503.) Here I give a summary of the variants in accidentals for four essays (Nos. III, XVI, XXI, XXVI) from four different periodicals, from which 1765A is again seen to be much closer to the periodical texts than is 1765B. In the presence or absence of a comma there is no significant difference between the two editions; 1765A agrees with the periodical texts seventeen times against 1765B, and 1765B agrees thirteen times against 1765A. In more important variations in punctuation—an exclamation mark for a period or semicolon, a question mark for a comma, and so on—1765A agrees with the earlier texts against 1765B in thirteen cases; 1765B agrees against 1765A in only two cases. In capitalization alone 1765B is closer to the periodical texts than is 1765A; it agrees with them in four cases against 1765A, whereas 1765A agrees in only two cases against 1765B. In all other differences —five in the use or absence of a hyphen and two in spelling—the agreement is uniformly on the side of 1765A. For all variants in accidentals in the four essays, then, 1765A agrees with the periodical texts thirty-nine times against 1765B; 1765B agrees with them nineteen times against 1765A. 9 In Lloyd's Evening Post the Essays was first advertised in the number for 3-5 June 1765, and a brief account of the work appeared in the same journal for 5-7 June. In the London Chronicle and St. James's Chronicle it was first advertised in the number for 11-13 June; in the Critical Review it was promptly noticed in the June number. 1765B, if the statement in the imprint that it was "Printed for W. Griffin, in Fetter-Lane" is to be believed, must have been published before the first of December 1765, for sometime between the middle of October and the end of November Griffin moved his shop from Fetter Lane to Catharine Street. In the advertisement of Daphne and Amintor in the London Chronicle for 12-15 October 1765 Griffin's address still appears as Fetter Lane, but in the advertisement of R. Boote's An Historical Treatise of an Action or Suit at Law in the same paper for 26-28 November—and in all later advertisements of Griffin's publications that I have seen—his address is given as Catharine Street. H. R. Plomer is in error in his statement that "In 1767 Griffin moved to Catherine Street in the Strand" ( Dictionary, p. 111). 10 If 1765B is a piracy, it might appear that authority could be given to its readings on the hypothesis that it was printed—possibly later than 1765—from a lost revised edition subsequent to 1765A; but nothing would really be gained by such a hypothesis. This lost edition, if it were authoritative, would have to be prior to the edition of 1766, since as copy for 1765B it could not contain the revisions and additions of 1766; its distinctive readings, consequently, would seem not to be revisions by Goldsmith for the same reasons that those of 1765B appear to lack authority; and—unless its title-page were printed from the 1756A engraved plate or had the 1766 vignette—it would be suspected of being a piracy because it was not advertised in the newspapers or called the second edition. The hypothetical edition would thus have the same status as 1765B. I am greatly indebted to Professor Fredson Bowers for assistance in the preparation of this paper.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Notes on Edward Gibbon's Mémoire Justificatif Robert R. Rea</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To few literary figures has been given the enjoyment of such thorough bibliographical coverage as Miss J. E. Norton provided in her Bibliography of the Works of Edward Gibbon (1940). Among the most significant contributions of this volume is the clarification of much of the detail surrounding the publication of Gibbon's chief digression into political propaganda, a semi-official "white-book" entitled Mémoire Justificatif pour servir de réponse a l'exposé, &amp;c. de la cour de France (1779). The excellence of Miss Norton's work and the prominent character of her subject combine to make further additions to the textual and bibliographical analysis of this pamphlet desirable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Three forms of the Mémoire Justificatif have previously been noted. The first edition was published under governmental supervision sometime between August 10, 1779, when Gibbon submitted to Lord Weymouth his "first, imperfect Essay, in this kind of Composition," 1 and October 7, when the General Evening Post noticed its appearance in print. 2 The title-page of this edition gives no information concerning printer, publisher, or distributor. A second issue of the first edition was produced for the bookseller Peter Elmsley by the printers T. Harrison and S. Brooke. Norton (p. 30) found this issue first mentioned in the Morning Chronicle of December 24, but earlier publication seems quite certain. Gibbon wrote on October 27 that Elmsley had already "desired to print a new Edition which he has swelled by the addition of the French Manifesto." 3 This supplement entitled Exposé des Motifs de la Conduite du Roi de France, relativement à l'Angleterre was separately paginated and bound so as to precede Gibbon's pamphlet. A reputed second edition incorporating English translations of the documents was printed by Harrison and Brooke and advertised in 1780 by the houses of Davies, Longman, and Dodsley (Norton, pp. 30-31). The true second edition appears, however, to be one which, by virtue of its extreme rarity, has escaped Gibbon's bibliographers altogether. 4 This new edition may be described as follows: EXPOSÉ | DES | MOTIFS | De la Conduite du Roi de FRANCE, rela-|tivement à l'ANGLETERRE. | [short rule] | MEMOIRE | JUSTIFICATIF | POUR SERVIR DE | RÉPONSE | À l'EXPOSÉ, &amp;c. | De la Cour de FRANCE. | [double rule] | LONDRES: | Et a DUBLIN chez GUILLAUME HALLHEAD, No. 63, | Damestreet. | [short rule] | M.DCC.LXXIX. 4°: A-B 4 2 A-D 4 . A1a [p. 1], title; A1b [p. 2], a notice concerning publication; A2a-B4b, pp. 3-16, text of the Exposé; 2 A1a-D4b, pp. 1-32, text of the Mémoire . Size: 11 3/16" x 8 3/4" (uncut copy). HT] MEMOIRE JUSTIFICATIF | pour servir de Résponse à l'Exposé, &amp;c. de la | Cour de FRANCE. That the new edition was printed subsequent to the second issue of the first edition is patent from half a dozen instances in which the typographical and textual corrections of the Elmsley issue are incorporated in the Hallhead pamphlet. Although the pagination is the same in both cases, the typesetting and spacing differ on four pages. In the Elmsley Mémoire the short notice explaining publication is headed "Avis du Libraire." The publisher of the new edition chose to omit that phrase and re-worded the paragraphs which followed. The elimination of "Avis du Libraire" and the capitalization of the word "De" in the title strongly suggest that the new edition was set directly from a copy partially described by Norton (p. 35) as a variant of the second issue located in the private collection of Lord Rothschild.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. In addition to its appearance in pamphlet form, Gibbon's Mémoire was reprinted in contemporary newspapers, periodicals, and in the author's Miscellaneous Works edited by Lord Sheffield (Norton, pp. 33, 35). As the Norton Bibliography mentions only the Annual Register as an English periodical source, two additions to this category may be cited. The Mémoire Justificatif is to be found in the London Magazine, XLVIII (1779), 582ff., and in John Almon's Remembrancer; or, impartial repository of public events, VIII (1779), 374ff. These are among the most accessible contemporary sources of the work in this country but they should be used with care. In both the Annual Register and Remembrancer versions the last four pages of the original pamphlet are transposed into the middle of the text and a half page is omitted. This error, obviously the result of a compositor's carelessness, leaves the text in the London Magazine the only reliable source of its type.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The most interesting of the textual variations to be found in the several editions of the pamphlet is that concerning the affair of La Belle Poule . This French vessel was engaged in the first naval action of the war when, in company with two smaller ships, Licorne and Pallas, she ran afoul Admiral Keppel's British squadron off Brest, June 18, 1778. The Frenchman was ordered to stand to by one of Keppel's frigates, but replied to the warning bow shot with a broadside. In the ensuing encounter La Belle Poule was able to withdraw into the safety of Brest harbor, but her escorts were taken. 5 Gibbon dealt with this affair in the Mémoire Justificatif, but erroneously described "les circonstances de la prise de la Belle Poule et de deux autres frégates." 6 This factual mistake was corrected in the second issue and carried into the second edition as a more modest statement concerning "les circonstances du combat avec la Belle Poule et de la prise des deux frégates." 7 Though not an especially significant error, this slip of Gibbon's pen and its correction is peculiarly interesting, as almost the same sort of error was made by his French protagonist Caron de Beaumarchais whose airy treatment of cold naval facts led to considerable embarrassment at the hands of outraged politicians. 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. The author of the Mémoire Justificatif was quite pleased with his handiwork. He remarked that "it has . . . been communicated as a State paper . . . to all the Ministers and Courts of Europe, and as far as I can understand it has been received with some degree of approbation" (Prothero, I, 372). He even mentioned a Turkish translation to Lord Sheffield who declared that, "At Petersburgh and Vienna it was currently observed by the Corps Diplomatique, that the English Ministry had published a Memorial written not only with great and more than usual ability, but also in French, so correct, that they must have employed a Frenchman" (Sheffield, I, xix-xx). Gibbon's high opinion of his own prowess (a characteristic not limited to the present problem) has been widely upheld despite an embarrassing lack of substantiation from the Continent. Norton's efforts uncovered only a translation of an English newspaper version at the Quai D'Orsay, and no other official foreign notice of the Mémoire has come to light. Certainly Gibbon's pamphlet circulated abroad, but as Madame du Deffand, who refused to read it, informed Horace Walpole, "Il n'a pas un grand succès." 9 A portion of the honors claimed by Gibbon must be attributed to the simultaneous publication under remarkably similar circumstances of another anonymous pamphlet bearing the same short title. This was Sir James Marriott's Mémoire Justificatif de la conduite de la Grande Bretagne, en arrêtant les navires étrangers et les munitions de guerre, destinées aux insurgens de l'Amerique (Londres: Imprimé par T. Harrison et S. Brooke, MDCCLXXIX). The Marriott pamphlet, which Norton found attributed to Gibbon in the French archives, was an able statement of maritime law written by a judge of the Admiralty court. Printed at the expense of the English government and circulated by Sir Joseph Yorke, ambassador at the Hague, it was directed to "all the Maritime Neutral Courts, with great success." 10 A comparison of the subject matter in the two Mémoires strongly suggests that Marriott's would have been of far more interest to Russian or Turk than Gibbon's pamphlet, and should receive long overdue recognition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. A concluding word may be devoted to the question of Gibbon's motives for writing the Mémoire Justificatif . Early and late commentators have carelessly implied or stated that the historian received his place at the Board of Trade for penning this pamphlet. 11 The origin of this idea is laid at the feet of John Wilkes by Gibbon's bibliographer (p. 26) with little consideration for either eighteenth-century politics or the clear implications of Wilkes's statements. It is evident from simple chronological study that Gibbon did not receive his post as a reward for having written the Mémoire Justificatif . 12 Gibbon would scarcely have written in anticipation of payment. "I will never make myself the Champion of a party," he declared. Such prostitution of pen was beneath him. But having accepted office, and in large part for financial reasons, he could no less afford to refuse the "very polite request" to become "the Advocate of my Country against a foreign enemy" (Prothero, I, 371-372). The political morality of the eighteenth century allowed a man of letters who accepted pension or place to become the anonymous mistress of a mercenary government, but did not demand a public display of the relationship. John Wilkes was not in error when he noted the plethora of literary state papers "since the ministerial purchase" of Gibbon's pen. He rightly viewed the Mémoire Justificatif as no more than the product of the ardent zeal of "a very late ministerial convert," a task "commanded by a task-master more cruel than those of Egypt." He did not baldly assert that "Gibbon was made a Lord Commissioner of Trade as a reward for writing it," as Norton implies (p. 26), but to the contrary deplored that "a lord of trade [had] been employed to traffic in the grossest abuse" of political polemic. 13 True, Wilkes blamed Gibbon for accepting a position at the hands of a government of which the historian disapproved, but his attack upon the author of the Mémoire Justificatif was a reaction to the undignified prostration of Clio before Mammon after the goddess's prayers had been answered. For that Wilkes need not be so heartily condemned—nor Gibbon so glibly exonerated.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Two New Works of Robert Southey Kenneth Curry</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A professional author such as Robert Southey, who made his living by his pen, was frequently tempted to write for the sole purpose of financial gain, and more than once he did a pamphlet or book with only the briefest mention in his correspondence. It is, therefore, likely that some of his works may have escaped notice when there has been no reference to the work in his published correspondence, and when, in addition, he did not put his name upon the title-page. In preparing an edition of Southey's unpublished correspondence, I have found allusions to two works of his not mentioned elsewhere: an edition of Don J. Ignatius Molina's The Geographical, Natural, and Civil History of Chili, London, 1809; and An Exposure of the Misrepresentations and Calumnies in Mr Marsh's Review of Sir George Barlow, London, 1813. To neither work can any claim for literary greatness be made, but as each represents an addition to the corpus of Southey's works a brief description of them is in order. The Molina was a sheer bit of editorial routine undertaken at the request of Longman. On 10 August 1809 Southey wrote his uncle, the Reverend Herbert Hill: Molina is translated by an American and printed in America. Longman sent it to me to know if it should be reprinted here, and I added the two Appendices and a few notes. Again on 31 August 1809 he wrote to his uncle: What I have done to Molina has been very little. I have only the first volume in the original and have seen none of the translations, which however the American translator, whoever he be, seems diligently to have examined. It seemed a proper place for abstracts from Agueros and Falkner, and accordingly there I placed them, with a few stray notes thro the volumes. An investigation of the Molina volumes bears out the implication in Southey's remarks that his work was perfunctory, but as he was always conscientious in whatever he undertook, he drew upon his extensive knowledge of South American history and provided an annotation from those authorities likely to prove illuminating. The English edition is a reprint of the translation printed at Middletown, Connecticut, for I. Ripley, in 1808, and attributed to "An American Gentleman," who actually was Richard Alsop (1761-1815), a resident of Middletown and one of the Hartford Wits. 1 To the English edition Southey contributed the following note (p. viii): In addition to what is said above, the English Editor has to state, that he has, from documents in his possession, added a few occasional Notes, which are distinguished by the letters E.E . He has also subjoined, from Falkner's Description of Patagonia, a further elucidation of the language of the Auracanos; and two Appendixes, the first containing an Account of the Archipelago of Chiloe, from the Descripcion Historial of that Province, by P. F. Pedro Gonzales de Agueros, printed at Madrid, in 1791; and the second, an Account of the Native Tribes who inhabit the Southern Extremity of South America, extracted chiefly from Falkner's Work. Notes so signed will be found on the following pages: Volume I, 31, 34, 37, 38, 66, 69, 99, 103, 116, 150, 151, 156, 158, 160, 191, 201, 226, 268, 273, 311, 313; Volume II, 26, 84, 85, 177, 217, 260, 275. The two appendices will be found in Volume II, 367-374, 375-385. The bibliographical description of these volumes is as follows (copies at Yale, the Library of Congress, the London Library, and the British Museum; the copy with the half-title is in my own possession): THE | GEOGRAPHICAL, | NATURAL, AND CIVIL | HISTORY OF CHILI. | TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN OF | THE ABBE DON J.

The first four leaves of each gathering are signed. Half-title: THE | HISTORY OF CHILI. | VOL. I. A map of Chili is inserted opposite the title-page. Volume II: pp. xii + 388, a 6 , B-U 8 X-Z, 8 Aa-Bb 8 Cc. 2 As a3 is signed and there is only one leaf preceding it, I have assumed the presence of a1 (a half-title to correspond with that of the first volume). Both volumes have advertisements at the end. Pages 322-324 of Volume I consist of advertisements, p. 323 continuing one from p. 322. In Volume II, pp. 386-388 are likewise advertisements. The Barlow pamphlet is a more important piece of work. Southey's uncle, the Reverend Herbert Hill, the rector of Streatham, was a neighbor of the Barlow family, whom Southey had met upon his visits to the Hills. Sir George Hilaro Barlow, Bart. (1762-1847), soon after his appointment as governor-general of India in 1807 had been forced to put down a mutiny. Many of the cashiered officers on their return to England wrote pamphlets against the Barlow administration; he was recalled in 1812, Lord Minto was sent in his place, and the peerage which the King had been willing to grant Barlow was withheld. Charles Marsh's pamphlet, Review of Some Important Passages in the late Administration of Sir G. H. Barlow, Bart. at Madras (London, 1813), had particularly disturbed the Barlows, and it was against what they felt were Marsh's calumnies that they wished to vindicate Sir George's name. Through the mediation of Southey's uncle, it may be understood, his aid was sought. A long letter of Southey's to Mr Hill (21 May 1813) discusses the whole matter. You know what I have written upon the Madras disturbances. The Carnatic Debts are not touched upon in that chapter. I had however gone thro all the papers concerning them which were laid before Parliament. My opinion was as much in favour of Sir G[eorge]. B[arlow]. in them as to the beginning of the business, as it was in the rebellion at the end. But in the progress I thought he acted in more than one instance, oppressively. You will believe me when I say that I should have been heartily glad to have thought him right throughout. If however Marsh's book applies chiefly to the Carnatic Debts, there is no reason why I should decline to answer him upon that point: and upon the general question the necessity of suppressing the rebellious spirit of the army, and the vigour with which it was done, too much cannot be said in praise of the Government of Madras. I have therefore no other feeling of repugnance at undertaking this task than that it makes me feel, for the first time in my life, like one whose talents are for sale, and who write not because he has information to communicate, amusement to offer or opinions to enforce, but wholly and solely because he is paid for writing. In this there is something humiliating. But a feeling of pride ought not to stand in the way, if there be no stronger reason. I know Marsh, and if we were Bedouin Arabs he would have a right to expect my protection, for he once ate bread and cheese and drank porter at some lodgings which I was occupying for a week in London. He came uninvited and unwelcome as well, and Wm Taylor in whose company he introduced himself would fain have been excused from bringing him, for Marsh is a worthless fellow. He was then going to India, and was not without fear of being shipt in a different direction, for among many dishonesties he had committed one which brought him within reach of the law, and I believe he had recourse to some shifts and stratagems to get safely on board. Let me see the plan which is sketched out, that I may chew the cud upon it. The business of course must be kept secret, and if it will not occupy much time, it had better be done at Streatham, where any alterations may be made as soon as they are suggested, and no time lost in a distant correspondence. On July 18th Southey added a few details in writing to his uncle: The nature of the reply seems to be clearly chalked out, and my thorough knowledge of the character of the man who is to be answered gives me no little advantage. If you think my personal appearance at Streatham is not necessary, send me Marsh's book and the other documents. . . . Believe me I should be heartily glad to find reason for believing that Sir G. B. was as right in every part of his conduct as he was in the great points of dispute. Be this as it may, I shall know how to take the strong ground and to read Marsh a lecture upon subordination. A few notes on the foregoing passages are necessary. Southey's phrase "what I have written upon the Madras disturbances" refers to his discussion of the very problem in the Edinburgh Annual Register, III, part I, 260-281 (Chapter 8), and his treatment of the matter there was so much in accord with what he was to say in the pamphlet that he needed to feel no qualms of conscience concerning the partisan stand he must take. A full, modern account of the troubles at Madras—and a defence of Barlow's action—will be found in Sir Alexander Cardew's The White Mutiny (London, 1929). Southey's pamphlet quotes at great length from Marsh's work and answers his charges one by one. The composition is plainly Southey's—written in the straightforward, unaffected prose of his biographies, letters, and Quarterly Review articles. Marsh's pamphlet had been published after the matter was thought to be concluded, and Southey accuses Marsh of trying to reopen an old issue. Marsh's career is cited to his disadvantage, and the testimony of Lord Minto (Barlow's successor) is quoted in Barlow's favor. Very occasionally the reader will find an idea that is especially characteristic of Southey but that has no particular connection with the controversy. Southey's opinion of the price paid by the Anglo-Indian for his fortune may serve as an illustration: The British adventurer in India pays a dear price for the fortune of which he goes in search; he leaves his parents and his friends, and the companions of his youth; time passes on; they for whose sake he has eagerly looked on to the hour of his return, drop off; and in that state of mind which arises from remembrance, and sorrow, and hope delayed, he repines at his lot, and perhaps silently acknowledges that no accumulation of wealth can be an adequate recompence for the sacrifice of the best years of his life, and the best affections of the heart. (p. 15) The bibliographical description of the pamphlet is as follows: AN | EXPOSURE | OF THE | MISREPRESENTATIONS | AND | CALUMNIES | IN | MR. MARSH'S REVIEW | OF | SIR GEORGE BARLOW'S | ADMINISTRATION AT | MADRAS, | BY | THE RELATIVES OF SIR GEORGE BARLOW. | [ double rule ] | LONDON : | SOLD BY BLACK, PARRY, AND CO.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Jefferson's Notes, 1793-94 * Coolie Verner P. J. Conkwright</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mathew Carey 1 came to America from Ireland in 1784, after a brief stay in Paris where he had worked with Benjamin Franklin in his Passy printshop. With the aid of a $400 loan from the Marquis de La Fayette he began his publishing career in Philadelphia. Among his earlier publications were the Pennsylvania Herald, first issued on January 25, 1785; the Columbia Magazine, in October, 1786, with five partners; and in 1792, the first book printed with Greek type in America. 2 Although he had been a printer in Ireland before fleeing to avoid persecution for political pamphleteering, Carey did not do all of his own printing. When, in 1793, he decided to publish a second American edition of Jefferson's Notes on Virginia 3 in 1,000 copies, he engaged Parry Hall at "149 Chestnut near Fourth" to be the printer. Hall composed the work in Edmund Fry's Pica Roman No. 1 and Pica Italic No. 2 . 4 As soon as he had pulled a proof sheet, he sent it to Jefferson on July 25, 1793, with a note: Parry Hall incloses a Proof Sheet of the Notes on Virginia; which with the greatest respect and a high sense of obligation, he lays before the Hon ble M r. Jefferson. 5 So far as can be determined, Jefferson made no textual changes; however, a curious alteration occurred which cannot be attributed specifically to either the author or printer. In all prior editions of the Notes, numbers (in parentheses) had been used to refer to the appended material containing Charles Thomson's comments on various passages in the text. Hall's sheets, however, used upper-case letters 6 in lieu of numbers. This change persists in most of the subsequent editions of the Notes and is an indication of the copy utilized in their composition. 7 Hall and his daughter are listed among those who died between the first of August and the middle of December in the Philadelphia plague of 1793. 8 Thereafter, the firm of Wrigley and Berriman moved into his shop and completed the printing of Carey's edition of the Notes, continuing with signature E. By the time they got to working sheet O, Carey increased his edition to 1500 copies, 9 and Wrigley and Berriman were forced to reset and run 500 additional sheets of the first three gatherings, B, C, and D. This explains the differences in the settings of these first three sheets. The two different states are easily distinguished. Hall ran his sheets on thin or ordinary paper, while Wrigley and Berriman used a thick paper water-marked A L MASSO that is clearly superior to the ordinary paper. 10 The presswork was probably done on a full sheet imposed eight pages up, in a "work and turn" operation; thus, 750 sheets were printed on one side, and the sheets were then turned and worked on the other side with the same eight pages. Each sheet thus produced two copies of the same signature. 11 Printing was completed by November 10, 1794, and the bill for the job was submitted to Carey. 12 From this bill we can learn the full details of the cost and production of the book. The bill lists the following items: To printing 1500 copies Jeffersons Notes on Virginia containing 42 forms and 4 pages 8 vo . This means, of course, 336 pages + 4, i.e., 42½ formes or really 43 formes to be charged at press. COMPOSITION To 40 forms 6888 m a form &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 a thousand is 19/3 a form 38.10.0 Composition is still computed by the thousand ems. An em is the square of the body of a type. Each text-page of this book required 861 ems, or 6888 ems for the eight-page forme. To 2 pages pica 4.9 These are the title, advertisement, and contents pages. Probably the three pages were lumped together and charged as two normal pica pages. To 2 forms long primer 11026 ms a form &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 a thousand is 30/3 a form 3.0.6 These two formes, or 16 pages, are the tables in the text. They average about 1378 ems per page. To 2 pages brevier 4752 ms &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 13.9 These are the small footnotes and such matter. They have 2376 ems per page. The composition to this point makes 42 formes plus 4 pages, as totaled above. To a table equal to 3 pages long primer 3675 &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 11.0 This was undoubtedly the folding table of Indian Tribes, and represents the cost of composition only. PRESSWORK To 43 forms at press each form 6 Tok &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 is 16/6 a form 35.9.6 Since a token is 250 impressions, and the edition was 1500, 6 tokens were required. Paper was no doubt furnished by Carey. 13 To presswork of the table 6 Tok 16.6 Although this was a smaller forme than the regular eight pages, it took the pressman just as long to run it; hence there was the same charge as for a regular forme, or 16/6. The total bill was £79.6.0; but since Parry Hall had already worked 1,000 copies of the first three formes, this was deducted from the bill: Deduct 4 Tok from each of the 3 first forms is 12 Tok &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 1.13.0 The final bill, then, was £77.13.0. The printing was completed on November 10, 1794, and the imprint dated November 12th. Carey advertised the book as available ". . . in about three or four weeks . . ." in the Philadelphia Gazette of Monday, November 17th. On November 26th he listed the Notes as ". . . neatly bound—1 dollar and a half."</field>

In the Appendix containing Thomson's Notes to which they refer, numerals are used in lieu of letters for (A), p. 293, and (B), p. 294, with (B) being misnumbered (1). 7 In addition to this use of upper-case letters there are errors on P2 v (p. 108) and P4 v (p. 112) of incorrect totals: "106" for "109" on p. 108, and "21" for "421" on p. 112.

"Bardic Symbols" was published in the Atlantic for April, 1860 (V, 445-447) without the questioned lines. Later, when Whitman included the poem in Leaves of Grass as "As I ebb'd with the ocean of life" (one of the "Sea-Drift" poems), the lines were restored. It is enlightening that only a few years before this, Lowell had deleted a line from Thoreau's "Chesuncook," without permission when he published it in the Atlantic . Thoreau took him strongly to task for the liberty and refused thereafter to submit any of his works to Lowell's editing. Apparently Lowell learned his lesson and thereafter consulted his authors before censoring their works.</field>

With thanks for your poem (of which I will send you proof in a few days), &amp; the best wishes for your welfare, I am Sincerely yours H. M. Alden. Ed. Harper's Mag. P.S. The poem will appear in an early number. H. M. A. Whitman's "The Song of the Redwood Tree" appeared in Harper's Monthly for February, 1874 (XLVIII, 366-367). It first appeared in book form in Two Rivulets, published in 1876.</field>

Of course they are hitherto unpublished—(my book, in which they go, will not be out for at least three or four weeks.) Walt Whitman. There are so many Commercials that it is impossible to identify this one positively. Possibly it was the Commercial Advertiser, which had published some of Whitman's poetry as early as 1871. "These articles" were possibly some of the prose writings which appeared in Two Rivulets that year.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">VII. (Postal card postmarked Camden, September 11, 1883, and addressed to Karl Knortz, cor Morris Avenue &amp; 155th Street, New York City) 431 Stevens Street Camden New Jersey Sept 11'83 —In a note rec'd from you quite a while ago (from Johnstown, Pa:) you mention some German translations of my poems by Dr ___?___ at Berlin (since dead)—Would you please give me the Dr's name exactly &amp; some particulars ab't the translations?___ Did you get Dr. Bucke's volume, which was sent you June 21 last?___ I have received the translations into German. (slips, papers, &amp;c) you have so kindly sent me from time to time ___ have not (otherwise) heard from you for some four months—I continue (though a half paralytic) well as usual— Walt Whitman Dr. Knortz was a German-American scholar who translated many American writers for German-speaking audiences. A large part of Whitman's correspondence with him is printed in Horst Frenz's "Walt Whitman's Letters to Karl eaking audiences. A large part of Whitman's correspondence with him is printed in Horst Frenz's "Walt Whitman's Letters to Karl Knortz" in the May, 1948, American Literature (XX, 155-163). Mr Frenz derived his texts from the appendix of Knortz's monograph on Whitman. The original manuscripts for the following letters printed by Frenz are in the Barrett collection: November 14, 1882; November 15, 1882; June 19, 1883; January 10, 1884; April 27, 1885; June 14, 1886 (for which there are important additions, see below); March 24, 1887; May 3, 1887; September 10, 1888; January 8, 1889; and February 14, 1889. They differ in no important details from Mr. Frenz's transcription except that he occasionally spells out some of Whitman's elisions in full and in the letter of November 14, 1882, transposes a postscript into the main body of the letter. There are also included in the Barrett collection this letter of September 11, 1883 and one for June 14, 1887, for which see below. Knortz was for several years pastor of the German Independent Protestant Congregation in Johnstown, Pa. In 1882 he moved to New York to do free lance editorial work. Although by this time there were several people translating Whitman into German, it seems likely that Whitman was referring here to Ferdinand Freiligrath who made the first translations in an essay in Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung for April 24, 1868. Dr. R. M. Bucke's book was his Walt Whitman, published in Philadelphia in 1883.</field>

The address was probably Knortz's lecture on Whitman, which was published in New York in 1886 as No. 14 in a series of "Vorträge des geselligwissenschaftlichen Vereins." The list of names will be familiar to students of Whitman, for they are all among his most ardent friends and disciples.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. (Light green paper, 10" x 8", two sheets, originally used by Ernest Rhys for his letter to Whitman of March 29, 1887). Camden April 11 '87 Noon Dear friend, I send you Rhys's letter to me rec'd yesterday—tho I suppose the disagreeable item in it, relating to the pub'n of y'r book has been already written to you ab't by R ___ My under the weather spell still continues, but with a slight let up.

His Reminiscences of Walt Whitman, however, did not finally appear until 1896. Whitman frequently traveled to New York in his later years to deliver a lecture on Lincoln on the anniversary of his death. Talcott Williams was an editor of the Philadelphia Press, an admirer of Whitman, and later director of the Columbia University School of Journalism. Kennedy and others of Whitman's Boston admirers contributed frequently to the Boston Transcript . O'Conner is, of course, William D. O'Connor, the author of The Good Gray Poet . Ernest Rhys's letter on the reverse of this manuscript discusses the English publication of Specimen Days, tells of a visit with Mrs. Costelloe, and announces that Wilson the publisher was too ill to attempt bringing out Kennedy's book.</field>

H. Gilchrist's Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings (New York, 1887) and later was annoyed that Knortz had not returned it, complaining to Horace Traubel to that effect on September 6, 1888. Whitman had eight or ten photographs taken by George C. Cox, but only one, which Whitman called "the laughing philosopher," was satisfactory to him. Cox sold these photographs to the general public, and, according to Whitman, was the only photographer who had the courtesy to pay him royalties. Whitman apparently never had the opportunity of meeting Knortz, for more than a year later, on September 3, 1888, he told Traubel that his curiosity to meet him was still great.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Remarks on E. Wead, "Early Binding Stamps of Religious Significance in Certain American Libraries: A Supplemental Report," Studies in Bibliography, II (1949).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In connection with Miss Wead's contribution (the first part of which, published in 1935, is not accessible to me), it may be of interest to many experts to learn some further particulars concerning the origin of the binding stamps illustrated therein. Inasmuch as a rather large number of bindings for the workshops named below are assembled in my book, Der verzierte gotische Einband im alten deutschen Sprachgebiet (Stuttgart, 1951), reference will be made to it for the sake of simplicity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The outer border of Fig. 4 is not made by a roll but by a rectangular die with two lilies placed one above the other. The stamp of the fall of man reproduced in Fig. 7 belongs to No. 100 of the Cologne workshop in my book. Of this workshop I was able to identify 72 bindings in 42 different ornamental forms of the last quarter of the 15th century. The binding of which Fig. 8 illustrates a stamp was probably made in Danzig. The rectangular forms of the Annunciation (Fig. 9) together with the two fighting cocks are found in the workshop of the Benedictine monastery Wiblingen (No. 36) as well as in that of the Ulm bookbinder (No. 126). Of the latter I have authenticated 252 bindings with 152 different stamps; of the former, 340 bindings with the same number of stamps. The Adoration of the Magi (Fig. 11) is to be allotted to the 38 different stamps of the monastery of Brothers of the Cross in Cologne (No. 17). Not from Kempten but from the Vienna Dominican monastery mentioned by Wead on page 72 come the stamps of Ill. 16 and 17. This monastery had at its disposal a large number of especially well cut forms.</field>
