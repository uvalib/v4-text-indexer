      <field name="heading_text">Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a celebrated essay in 1941 on "The Crisis in Cataloging," 1 Andrew D. Osborn remarked, "The relationship between cataloging and bibliography has been a difficult one to define" (p. 400). Indeed, anyone who has investigated the history of attempts to define it will regard this comment as a considerable understatement: the matter is intrinsically complex, but to make matters worse bibliographers and cataloguers have often been unsympathetic, or even hostile, toward each other's practices and approaches. Yet descriptive bibliography and cataloguing, as Osborn continues, "have many points of contact and many elements in common. Their history has been intertwined in many respects." The two are naturally related pursuits, and the interests of all who are concerned with books are best served by a spirit of cooperation between them; the split which threatens to make them continually more incompatible does no one any good. Both have become specialties, with the familiar result that communication is hampered; and those working in each field go their own way, without being well informed about, or perhaps even interested in, what is happening in the other. Bibliographers and cataloguers, and many other people as well, constantly consult both catalogues and bibliographies; the two kinds of works are necessarily different, having different aims, but they are both parts of a larger undertaking—the recording of intellectual products and their physical embodiments. A user of these works should ideally be impressed more by their compatibility than by their divergence, and anything which produces greater communication between bibliographers and cataloguers is a move in the right direction. The present moment is particularly appropriate for an increased effort at mutual understanding. For their part, bibliographers have shown in recent years a renewed interest in the production of lists which do not entail full physical descriptions. D. F. McKenzie, for instance, has suggested that bibliography can perhaps best serve the study of history and literature "by returning . . . to the more directly useful, if less sophisticated, activity of enumerative 'bibliography.'" 2 And David F. Foxon has stated "the case for another species of bibliographer whose role lies somewhere between the enumerative and the descriptive"; 3 after explaining the rationale of his own English Verse, 1701-1750 : A Catalogue , he adds: What I do feel very strongly is that work of this kind is as essential to scholarship as the full-scale descriptive bibliography; that if librarians are going to turn to computers and cooperative cataloguing, this is the sort of standard at which they should aim; and that bibliographers should be aware that this sort of drudgery is as rewarding, both to themselves and others, as its more fashionable manifestations. (p. 30) Both writers allude to the accomplishments of Pollard, Redgrave, and Wing in producing "short-title catalogues" and comment on the need for an eighteenth-century STC; and the attention now being given to this need has provided the occasion for useful discussions about the nature and form of such works. 4 But the suggestion, in these two statements, that bibliographers must "return" from "sophisticated" or "fashionable" activity misleadingly implies that they have been irresponsible and have abandoned what is basic. There is no reason why these approaches have to be set in opposition to each other, for the pursuit of descriptive bibliography does not involve a disrespect for the making of outwardly simpler lists and catalogues. Fredson Bowers, on the opening page of his Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), recognizes that catalogues "will always exist as one of the basic needs of scholarship." Whether or not this view may have been lost sight of by descriptive bibliographers, these recent statements are a healthy reaffirmation of the value of catalogues and lists. To them should be added another obvious point: that bibliographers contemplating work on a short-title catalogue or list ought to be aware of standard library cataloguing practices, so that they are in a position to take advantage of any that seem useful for their purposes. Conversely, cataloguers now more than ever need to examine descriptive bibliography for possible techniques or procedures that could be incorporated with advantage into their own work. Cataloguing in recent years has been at a critical juncture in its history, with the emergence of increasing possibilities for international standardization and cooperation as reflected in the extent of the agreement reached at the 1961 International Conference on Cataloguing Principles in Paris. The publication of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (1967), based on the Paris principles, and the development of the International Standard Bibliographic Description (1971), designed to make the elements of a catalogue description recognizable through punctuation, as well as the distribution of MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) magnetic tapes, 5 have served to indicate the enormous influence which cataloguing procedures can have and to provide an occasion for rethinking those procedures. Although it is unfortunate that these standard codes were promulgated without consideration of the contributions which descriptive bibliography might make, it is not too late to incorporate alterations in them, if changes are found to be desirable. Relatively speaking, we are still at the beginning of the tenure of these rules; and, if further improvements can be made in them by drawing on the experience of descriptive bibliography, this is the time for effecting those changes. Cooperation between bibliographers and cataloguers, however, can be significant only if the relations between their activities are clearly recognized. I should like to begin by looking into this relationship, attempting to define the position each occupies in the whole realm of bibliographical study. Then, on this tenth anniversary of the appearance of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules , I propose to examine some of those rules from the point of view of the descriptive bibliographer. As a result, I hope that it will be possible to survey with understanding various suggestions for cataloguing "rare" books and to point out some ways in which the approach of bibliographers and that of cataloguers can be brought closer together without placing an unfair burden on cataloguers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The distinction between catalogues and bibliographies is an elementary one; yet it is not always kept clearly in mind by those engaged in bibliographical activity. Of course, one person can call his work a "catalogue" and mean something entirely different from what someone else means by "catalogue." Neither person is necessarily confused in his thinking; each is merely using a different definition of "catalogue." Such differences are always possible where matters of definition are involved. But I am not speaking here of the definitions of particular terms; rather, I am concerned with two different concepts, regardless of what they are labeled. One kind of record of books 6 —which it is convenient to call a "catalogue"—is concerned with the particular copies of books that happen to be in a given collection (a private library, an institutional library or special collection within it, a dealer's stock, and the like) or that constitute a specifically defined assemblage (items brought together for an exhibition or an auction, for instance). 7 Another kind of record of books—which it is convenient to call a "bibliography"—is concerned with books which are related in some way, but not with specific copies of those books. In other words, an entry in a catalogue refers to a particular copy of a book; an entry in a bibliography refers to any copy of that book. This distinction can best be illustrated by noting that the goal of descriptive bibliography is the description of an "ideal copy" of each book, a term carefully defined by Fredson Bowers ( Principles , pp. 113-123) to refer to the complete state that the printer or publisher "considered to represent the final and most perfect state of the book." An ideal copy is not necessarily free of textual errors, but it is free of those physical deficiencies which would prevent its representing a standard form of the book as published. It is therefore an abstraction, for conceivably all existing copies of a book might be defective in one way or another, but a description of an ideal copy could still be constructed by combining details observable in the defective copies. A description of an ideal copy sets a standard against which individual copies can be measured; a catalogue entry describes or records an individual copy with all its peculiarities. 8 Simple as this distinction essentially is, it raises some complicated questions which have been much discussed. Sometimes, there is a tendency to think that the amount of descriptive detail is a part of the distinction. 9 But it should be clear that both catalogues and bibliographies can run the gamut from the sparse to the elaborate. Some catalogues, like Allan Stevenson's volume of the Hunt catalogue (1961), include fuller physical descriptions than are found in a great many descriptive bibliographies. And some catalogues, like William A. Jackson's Pforzheimer catalogue (1940), involve comparisons between copies in the collection and other copies, so that the precise nature of the copies in the collection can be more clearly specified; in this way a catalogue can actually record the characteristics of an ideal copy, but so long as the object of description is one specific copy the work remains a catalogue. Naturally, as the quantity of detail declines, the differences between the entries for a given book in a catalogue and a bibliography are likely to become slighter—or nonexistent. If an entry consists of nothing more than a simple listing of author, title, and date, such an entry for a book in a catalogue could not be distinguished from the same style of entry for that book in a bibliography (or "checklist"). But the indistinguishability of the two entries would not alter the fact that the purposes of the two lists, and thus the significance of the two entries, were different. In the first case, the entry refers to one specific copy of the book; in the second, it refers to any copy. A catalogue, then, is not merely a less detailed bibliography; the extent of detail is irrelevant to its classification as a catalogue. Furthermore, the account of an ideal copy in a descriptive bibliography, however much or little detail is given, requires a great deal more research (the examining of many copies) than is normally expended on a catalogue entry; but the catalogue entry can—within its limits (the description of a specific copy)—be equally authoritative. Of course, in describing a single copy without the benefit of a published bibliography or the examination of other copies, one cannot always know exactly which features may be of special significance; for this reason the entries in catalogues are in practice rarely as informative, even for the specific copy, as entries in bibliographies. Nevertheless, it is not the quantity of detail or the extent of research which distinguishes the two kinds of entry but solely the nature of the copy which each aims at recording. 10 Another question which complicates one's thinking about catalogues and bibliographies is the determination of what is meant by "book"—of what, in fact, is being recorded. The word "book" is sometimes used to refer to a physical object (or a group of physical objects, such as all those comprising one edition); at other times it refers to the work (the verbal construction) embodied in the pages of the physical book. Clearly this distinction is basic, and the nature of a bibliographical record is determined by whether that record is principally concerned with books or with works . It might at first be supposed that a catalogue inevitably deals with books, not works, since it lists specific copies. Unquestionably a catalogue must involve this element; but many catalogues of books are used as guides to the works on a given subject, and their compilers sometimes have this function in mind and provide annotation which emphasizes it. Seymour Lubetzky, in Principles of Cataloging (1969), has offered a careful analysis of the book-vs.-work distinction in the context of library cataloguing (pp. 1-17). 11 First he sums up the perennial debate over whether a library catalogue should be a "finding list" or a "reference tool," whether it should merely locate certain books for its users or provide a guide to the works incorporated in those books. 12 Later he concisely states these two questions which are involved in cataloguing the "records of man's thought": First, how are they, as concrete entities, to be individually identified and entered in a catalog so that they could readily be found when needed; and Second, how are they, as sources of information on various subjects, to be characterized and related so that they could be found by those in search of the information desired. 13 It is obvious that a catalogue will be useful to more people if it performs both functions, and users of institutional libraries now regularly expect to find such catalogues of the holdings of those libraries. As a result, library cataloguing is generally divided into two activities, descriptive cataloguing (dealing with author or title entry and with the physical characteristics of the books) and subject cataloguing or classification (dealing with the content of the works). Lubetzky's principal point is that in neither activity has the distinction between book and work been clearly focused on in the past; therefore, he says, it has not been sufficiently understood that physical description is basic to all cataloguing, since works exist in a library only as embodied in individual books. If the record of particular copies in catalogues can thus serve to supply information about works , there is no question that bibliographies or checklists (recording ideal copies) can do so too. Indeed, the commonest form of checklist is that in which the primary emphasis is on the content of the works named. The border line separating details relating to the book from those relating to the work is not always sharp (some details serve both purposes), but one cannot think clearly about catalogues and bibliographies without keeping this division in mind and recognizing the extent of mixture of the two approaches in any given listing. Both catalogues and bibliographies can vary in the degree to which they lean toward providing information either on books or on works; but where they stand in that respect does not affect the crucial distinction between catalogues and bibliographies, based on the difference between specific and ideal copies. The division between books and works is analogous to Lloyd Hibberd's separation of the field into "physical bibliography" and "reference bibliography." 14 His useful essay recognizes that the amount of detail which a bibliographical record contains is less significant for classifying it than whether it is concerned with the physical form or with the content of the items recorded. His survey of the confusing array of terms in use and his suggestions for terminology which more accurately shows the relationships among bibliographical activities have been generally well received; but Rolf Du Rietz in a thoughtful essay 15 recently complained that Hibberd's "well-meant" proposal "has unfortunately further contributed to separate the two supposedly widely different 'kinds' of bibliography from each other instead of bringing them closer together" (p. 22). According to Du Rietz, the belief that reference bibliography is concerned only with the content of books leads to such lax standards in the inevitable allusion to physical detail in reference bibliographies that physical bibliographers are bound to have a low opinion of it. His principal point is that all bibliographical lists are to some extent physical (e.g., pp. 15-16, 22), because lists referring only to works and not to the books embodying the works would simply have entries like "Hitler's Mein Kampf " and "do not deserve the name of bibliographies, since they do not list books at all" (p. 24); therefore, he says, reference bibliographers must have training in physical bibliography, so that their lists will offer responsible treatment of the physical details which they cannot avoid. This warning is salutary and, in noting the physical element in book lists, calls attention to a fact not sufficiently recognized. But Du Rietz goes too far, it seems to me, in the direction of blurring a useful distinction when he is led to conclude that there is "no such thing as 'a' physical bibliography, or 'a' reference bibliography" (p. 24). It is true that all bibliographies in one sense involve a mixture of both physical and reference elements, but that does not prevent the principal emphasis or concern of a given listing from being on one or the other. Reference lists, for instance, frequently cite the city, publisher, and date of the first printing of a work without implying that the reader is necessarily being directed to the first printing in preference to a later printing or edition. The facts of publication are offered as historical annotation, not as physical details, even though these same details would of course be a part of a physical bibliography as well. Such listings are similar to references sometimes found in the body of a literary discussion: " Moby-Dick (New York: Harper, 1851)" may not mean anything more than " Moby-Dick ," except that more historical details are provided; indeed, page references might be given to a later and more accessible edition—but again without any implication that the reader should not turn to still another edition, more convenient for him, to locate the cited passages. Even a catalogue can emphasize reference bibliography, if the interest is more in what works are represented by the books in a collection than in what particular books are there. To be sure, a catalogue cannot avoid physical implications, since it is based on a specific gathering of books; but the purpose of a catalogue can be, as its annotation would make clear, to show what works (regardless of edition) are available in that collection. 16 Reference bibliography can simply be regarded as primarily concerned with works, physical bibliography as primarily concerned with books. The approach in each case will determine what details are reported and how they are treated; but it should not be surprising that some of the same details will turn up in both kinds of bibliographies, since the two approaches are complementary. I take it that Hibberd is making the same point when he says, "And though divergent in purpose and scope, the two divisions start from the common basis of systematic compilation and end in reciprocal fructification" (p. 133). Du Rietz, too, wishes to show the intimate relationship between the two, but in stressing the physical elements in reference bibliography he makes reference bibliography in effect a preliminary step leading toward, or a less thorough form of, physical bibliography. 17 He is unwilling to let the word "bibliography" move beyond its etymology and encompass a concern for works as well as for books; the result is that for him reference and physical bibliography together form one camp and "information science" the other. Although he is reluctant to link "the immensely powerful information science" with "the rather humble and unsophisticated kind of activity of reference bibliography," he admits that a bibliographical list could conceivably be regarded as involving both physical bibliography and information science (p. 26). The issue is thus a question of terminology, for the dichotomy in any case is between books and works. It makes little difference whether "reference bibliography" is salvaged as a term, so long as we know when we are thinking about works rather than books. The relationships I am describing can perhaps be clarified by a diagram: What this diagram attempts to suggest is, first, that there are two basic kinds of finished product resulting from bibliographical activity: the catalogue, dealing with specific copies, and the bibliography, concerned with ideal copies. The catalogue may refer to copies outside a given collection or to accounts of ideal copies, but its primary function is to refer to particular copies; the bibliography may cite the peculiarities of individual copies or offer a census of surviving copies, but its primary function is to refer to standard copies, free from the deficiencies which may happen to occur in any one copy. Both catalogues and bibliographies may take the form of essays rather than lists, but their essential function remains unchanged. Second, the arrangement of the diagram suggests that both catalogues and bibliographies partake of both reference bibliography, in which the subject matter is the works embodied in books, and physical bibliography, in which the subject matter is the books as physical objects. However, their interest in these two approaches is rarely equal, and they may move in one direction or the other, stressing either reference bibliography or physical bibliography. Finally, both catalogues and bibliographies, whether emphasizing reference or physical bibliography, can present a great deal of detail or very little detail. If the emphasis is reference, that detail will take the form of annotation suggestive of the nature or value (or both) of the works included; if the emphasis is physical, that detail will take the form of description of the physical makeup of the books included. 18 As the detail in a reference or a physical bibliography becomes less, the entries in the two come to resemble each other more and more, and for that reason I have employed the same word, "enumerative," to refer to lack of detail in either case. 19 But the fact that the entries are stripped to the information basic to both approaches does not mean that the functions of reference and physical bibliography have become blurred; the entries may even be identical, but their significance is different depending on the context in which they occur. And the context is determined by two factors: whether the emphasis is on reference or physical bibliography and whether the product is a catalogue or a bibliography. For example, the city and year of publication reported in a catalogue entry are to some extent physical details because a particular copy is being referred to; yet the general approach, as revealed in a preface or in other notes attached to entries, may be to regard the listing as primarily useful for its record of works, not books, and in this case the city and year are not essentially physical details. The cataloguer has a right to take this approach if he wishes to; the trouble comes only if his practice in recording what are partly physical details is positively misleading to anyone familiar with the way the same details would be handled in a catalogue stressing physical bibliography. The problem arising from the fact that any catalogue or bibliography can move toward the physical or toward the reference end of the scale is not simply a matter of how many details are included but rather of how the included details are treated. 20 There is no question that the differing approaches of reference and physical bibliography have frequently produced incompatible results in the past. Du Rietz has said that bibliography and information science are "notoriously at loggerheads in all matters terminological" and that "the libraries will apparently remain an unavoidable battle-field for the combatants until some modus vivendi may be achieved" (pp. 26-27). The libraries are at the center of this debate precisely because they attempt, through catalogues and indexes in whatever form, to offer a guide both to the books in their holdings and to the works contained in those books. Of course, any cataloguer or bibliographer confronts this issue to some degree in his own work, but institutional libraries, because they process large numbers of books, naturally become the most prominent illustration of the problem. The real point of contact between the two approaches (or the "battle-field" where one can see the conflict in progress) is in the pages or cards of bibliographies and catalogues. Certainly the concerns of information retrieval can lead one far from the physical book; but since information must be recorded in some concrete form and since different physical embodiments of the same work may contain variations in text which affect the "information" conveyed, the two approaches are ultimately inseparable. Physical and reference bibliography—or whatever we choose to call them—are tied together (as my diagram tries to show) in every catalogue or bibliography that is produced. Since they move in different directions, however, a catalogue or bibliography which is primarily concerned with reference bibliography may have only a small area which overlaps the concerns of the descriptive bibliographer, and vice versa—but they inevitably do overlap. It is in that overlapping area where the methods of the two approaches must be compatible; if they are not, catalogues and bibliographies will be less efficient tools, and scholarship will suffer. In preparing, using, and evaluating catalogues and bibliographies, one must keep firmly in mind the various relationships among the three sets of paired concepts discussed here: works vs. books, reference bibliography vs. physical bibliography, enumeration vs. detail. One will then realize that it is pointless to criticize a catalogue for being insufficiently descriptive of physical details, if it has set out to perform a different service; but one can legitimately complain if the physical details included are presented ambiguously or misleadingly or in a manner which is in actual conflict with the way those details would be presented in a catalogue stressing physical bibliography. 21 Reference bibliography and physical bibliography are complementary, and those who are seriously interested in contributing to either field must approach their individual task in a spirit of cooperation with those who are working in another branch of what is finally a single undertaking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It is obvious that many more books are catalogued with fairly brief entries by librarians than are accorded detailed descriptions by bibliographers and that there are many more library cataloguers at work than there are descriptive bibliographers. It is not surprising, therefore, that more attention has been given over the years to the principles and practices of library cataloguing than to those of descriptive bibliography. 22 The present Anglo-American Cataloging Rules ( AACR ) have developed from a tradition that can be traced back to Panizzi's British Museum rules of 1841 and includes Charles A. Cutter's Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalogue (1876), the American and British Library Associations' Catalog Rules of 1908, the "Preliminary American Second Edition" of those rules in 1941, the Rules for Descriptive Cataloging in the Library of Congress (1947, 1949), and the A. L. A. Cataloging Rules for Author and Title Entries (1949). 23 At many stages along the way there have been formal discussions, committee meetings, investigative reports, and institutes to plan revisions and new developments in the code. In the fifteen years before the publication of AACR in 1967, Seymour Lubetzky prepared proposals for new rules (1953) and drafts of rules reflecting the work of the Code Revision Committee (1958, 1960); official institutes on revision of the code were held at Stanford (1958) and McGill (1960); other conferences on cataloguing took place at the University of Chicago (1956) and at St. Andrews, N. B. (1961); and an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles was held in Paris in 1961, with 53 countries and twelve international organizations represented. 24 Since then, discussion has continued, as at the conferences on AACR at the Universities of Toronto and British Columbia in 1967 and at the University of Nottingham in 1968, 25 and some further changes have been made in AACR (in a ten-page supplement added to the 1970 impression and in the version of Chapter 6 published separately in 1974). 26 As the product of so much deliberation, the AACR must be of interest to the descriptive bibliographer, both because any well-considered approach to the recording of books is relevant to his concerns and because this one in particular reflects the cumulative experience of several generations of cataloguers and will exert great influence. Michael Gorman has been quoted as saying, "This is not only the best cataloguing code we have, it is also the best we are likely to have for a very long time." 27 It is not unfair, therefore, to expect AACR to be based on a clear understanding of the kinds of relationships among bibliographical activities which were outlined above. And it is legitimate to scrutinize the extent to which the recording of physical details as directed by the rules is useful to descriptive bibliographers. Chapter 6 of AACR , on the "descriptive cataloging" of separately published monographs, is naturally the focus of attention for the descriptive bibliographer. Perhaps the best way to begin an examination of its approach is to look at Rule 141, on "collation." 28 Traditionally what is called the "collation" in a library catalogue card or entry consists of three parts: pagination, illustrations, and size. The "preliminary note" to this rule emphasizes its concern with physical details: the "collation" is called "the cataloger's description of the physical work" (p. 47), and one of the aims is "to present a picture of the physical characteristics of the work to the reader" (p. 48). But one should notice that "work" rather than "book" is the word chosen and that the physical characteristics are recorded in order to help the reader "both in identifying the work and telling him something of its nature." Furthermore, another aim is "to ensure that all those parts of the work are described which would be retained in the binding or rebinding of the work," implying that the emphasis is on the substance of the work and that other integral leaves, such as those containing advertisements, are unimportant. It is clear, even from this introductory statement, that the "collation" is to be principally concerned with an indication of the extent of the contents of the book and not with the book itself. There is no reason to object to this emphasis, except that the "collation" has been defined as the "description of the physical work." If "work" here means "book," the usage is imprecise and the statement untrue. If it is being used carefully, in distinction to "book," the inclusion of the word "physical" still causes a problem: since the work exists physically only as embodied in the book, the physical description can only be based on the book, which may contain elements (such as advertisements) which are not part of the work . The rules for recording pagination (or foliation) reflect the same ambiguity. First one is told (141B1a) that the "extent of a work" is to be indicated in terms of pages, leaves, or columns, depending on the method followed in the book being catalogued. The implication is that the cataloguer is concerned with the characteristics of the physical book, since the method of numbering employed in a given book is not related to the extent of the work; if the sole interest were in indicating extent, all figures for all books could be converted to a single unit, such as pages. The same impression is conveyed by the further rule (141B1b) that arabic or roman numbers or letters are to be used, following the practice of the book. But this rule ends with the statement that "Pages or leaves numbered in words, or in characters other than Arabic or Roman, are designated in the collation in Arabic figures." Thus the emphasis has shifted to an indication of the extent of the work, eliminating a report of the actual system of numbering used. What is the rationale, one may ask, for allowing the nature of the characters employed in numbering the pages or leaves of a given book to determine whether the cataloguer reports in his entry a characteristic of the book (the actual system used) or a characteristic of the work (its extent, measured in convenient terms)? If the numeration in a book is divided into two or more series, the North American AACR —following a long-standing tradition in library cataloguing—requires the recording of the "last numbered page or leaf of each numbered section" (141B1c). In many books, of course, the last page of text is not numbered, and this rule clearly places the emphasis on recording a physical detail (which pages are in fact numbered) rather than on specifying with precision the extent of the work. 29 Yet the emphasis shifts the other way in the determination of what constitutes a section: "either a separately numbered group of pages, or leaves, or an unnumbered group which, because of its length (one fifth or more of the entire work), or its importance, should be mentioned." 30 When bulk or importance becomes a criterion for the inclusion of information, certainly no attempt is being made to provide an accurate accounting of the physical structure of the book. But, then, if a small or "unimportant" section of text can be omitted, the representation of the extent of the work is not entirely accurate, either. Indeed, the aim, as it emerges two paragraphs later (141B1e), is only to provide an approximate idea of the bulk of the work: one is told that a correction may be required if "the last numbered page or leaf does not represent the total number, or approximately the total number, of pages or leaves in the work or in the section." 31 The same mixture of aims appears in the instructions for recording the pagination: the figure representing a group of unnumbered pages is to be enclosed in brackets (141B1c), thus emphasizing a physical detail; but where the numbering changes from roman to arabic within a sequence (e.g., i-viii, 9-176), the whole sequence is to be represented by the arabic total (141B1e), thus emphasizing the extent of the section rather than the physical details of the numbering. Similarly, advertisements which constitute separate groups of pages (whether numbered or unnumbered) are to be disregarded (141B1c), placing the emphasis on the work, not the book; but if the advertising pages continue the page numbering of the text, the last page number in the sequence is to be given, with a parenthetical indication of which pages the advertisements occupy (141B11), thus making the physical detail of pagination dominant over the content of the pages. 32 One of the awkward situations produced by these rules is illustrated at the end of rule 141B1c itself. Since the rules require that a note be provided to call attention to the presence and extent of a "bibliography" (that is, a reference list) in a book, and since such a "bibliography" might well occur on a final unnumbered page, provision must be made for referring to such a page in certain instances. The solution offered in this rule is illustrated by the pagination record "86, [1] p." and the note "Bibliography: p. [87]." Aside from the awkwardness of referring to the 87th page in two different ways, the basic difficulty is that the use of brackets implies a concern with the actual pagination, while the necessity for adding the "[1]" arises solely from the nature of the material printed on that page. There could be still more unnumbered pages, which would not be recorded because their content did not demand reporting. The principal interest, clearly, is in the content, and pagination references derived from physical description do not always serve that purpose efficiently; but, used in this way, they do not serve the purposes of the descriptive bibliographer either, because they do not necessarily form a complete record. The handling of various special problems connected with pagination further reveals this awkward mixing of approaches. When there is no numbering in a book at all, the printed pages are counted and the number placed in brackets—or, if the figure is over 100, the number may be estimated (141B2). And when there are several (more than three) "numbered main sections," the numbers on the last numbered page of each section are added together and presented in the form "968 p. in various pagings" (141B3b). Both these rules obviously emphasize the work, not the book. Why, then, is the numbering of the individual main sections to be reported when there are no more than three of them, with other lesser sections recorded in the form of a total, as in "xiv, 226, [44] p." (141B3a)? 33 The fact that there are fewer main sections does not alter the cataloguer's aim; and the resulting series of figures represents more than one system, since the bracketed figure here is a total of two or more sequences (it could also, in another situation, refer to a single unnumbered section). Furthermore, the bracketed figure itself could result from more than one system, if some of the sections it refers to are unnumbered and some numbered, since all printed pages are counted in unnumbered sections and only the last numbered page in numbered ones. If the primary interest is, as it would seem to be, in recording the extent of the work, what is the point of introducing an element of physical description which complicates that record and yet does not, because of its ambiguity, furnish an offsetting benefit to a descriptive bibliographer? Two other rules about pagination deserve to be commented on. One describes the treatment of works in more than one volume (141C): when the pagination of the volumes is separate, only the number of volumes is to be recorded; but when the pagination is continuous, it is to be added in parentheses, as "2 v. (xxxi, 999 p.)." This rule is doubly peculiar. In the first place, it is difficult to understand why the physical division into two or more volumes renders a reference to pagination unnecessary, when pagination—rather than "1 v."—is considered the appropriate way to indicate the extent of a work in one volume. After all, some two-volume works are shorter than some one-volume works. 34 Second, it is not clear why the continuity of pagination is a reason for recording the paging; the pagination is either worth listing or not worth listing, but the fact that it starts over in the second volume does not make it irrelevant. The logic is even further confused in the statement that "Separately paged preliminary matter in volumes after the first is ignored unless it is important; if it is important, the work is not considered as being paged continuously"—in which case the pagination is not noted at all. One is left with the anomaly that the presence of "important" matter in a separately paged preliminary section in the second volume of a two-volume work is a reason for eliminating the record of pagination entirely. 35 Surely this is a prime example of the situation in which a physical detail of bookmaking is allowed to interfere with the effective indication of the extent of the work. 36 The other pagination rule which requires particular comment deals with incomplete copies (141B12): "If the last part of a work is wanting, and the paging of a complete copy cannot be ascertained, paging is given in the form 179+ p., with note of the imperfection." Aside from the illogical reference to "the last part of a work," when a book can be defective in other places as well, the problem with this rule is its conception of the function of a catalogue listing. Whereas the rules previously discussed have shown some confusion about the distinction between books and works, this rule reveals some indecision about whether the undertaking is a catalogue or a bibliography. The implication here is that the pagination of a complete copy, when known, is recorded in the collation line (presumably with a note somewhere pointing out the defect in the copy under examination). But if these are catalogue rules—not rules for bibliographies, which refer to ideal copies—the basis for each entry must be the book present in the collection being catalogued. 37 The emphasis may be on the content of the book rather than on its physical features, but any physical features mentioned must conform to the characteristics of the specific copy at hand. Details about the characteristics of a complete copy may be useful, but they are strictly supplementary. Perhaps the role of the Library of Congress in supplying printed catalogue cards to other libraries has helped to weaken the concept of a catalogue entry as an accounting of a specific copy; in any event, a code of cataloguing rules should not contribute to the confusion by implying that a catalogue card or entry refers to an ideal rather than an actual copy. 38 The second element in the collation, following the designation of the pagination or foliation or number of volumes, is a brief reference to any illustrative matter in the book. It consists of nothing more than the abbreviation "ill.", "unless particular types [of illustrations] in the work are considered important enough to be specifically designated"; when that occurs there are several specific terms, like "diagrams," "maps," "music," or "portraits," to choose from (141D1a). As with pagination, the intent is obviously to suggest something about the content of the work, not to record the precise physical structure of the book; but the emphasis here is on the nature of the illustrations, not their extent. A later rule (141D4) does permit specifying the number of illustrations, but only if they are numbered or "if the number can readily be ascertained"; and any numbers given are to be arabic and are not to appear in brackets even if the illustrations themselves are unnumbered. This rule, unlike the rules for pagination, reveals no indecision regarding aims, for the focus is entirely on content: such physical details as the manner of numbering the illustrations are not allowed to intrude into a statement about the illustrations. A problem arises, however, from the fact that the previous part of the collation, the pagination statement, may also refer to plates (141B1d) and to music (141B10) when they occur in separately paged or unpaged sections or on pages not otherwise covered by the notation of pagination. Examples given are "xvi, 246 p., 24 leaves of plates" and "74 p., 15 p. of music." Apparently the rationale is that this part of the collation line indicates the "extent" of the work and would be misleading without the mention of these major elements; the second part then takes up the nature of the illustrative matter as a whole, whether it occurs on separate pages or on pages which are included in the numbering of major sequences. 39 This illustration statement thus becomes a commentary on one aspect of the content of the pages recorded in the pagination statement. Two questions immediately come to mind. First, if the extent of a work in numerical terms is to be supplemented by some comment on the manner of presentation of the material, why are illustrations singled out for comment? And why are illustrations defined to include genealogical tables and graphs (141D1a) and to exclude tables in general (141D1b)? Second, if other groups of pages need not be labeled in the pagination statement, why should those containing plates and music be named? Plates may be scattered through a volume, but as far as the measurement of the extent of the work is concerned they would seem to be no different from the "lesser variously numbered or unnumbered sections" (141B3a) for which a single unlabeled total is to be provided. The treatment of illustrations thus raises another question about the purposes of the pagination statement. As for the illustration statement itself, the problem is less one of aims than of consistency in carrying them out. One wonders whether the expression "ill." (or even one of the more precise terms) is informative enough to bother including; but the question clearly has to do with reference bibliography, not descriptive bibliography, for physical description is not intended. The third part of the collation is an indication of size, consisting of the measurement in centimeters (rounded off to the next higher full centimeter) of the height of the binding (141E1). This measurement is of course a physical detail, but it is only one of several measurements which would be of interest to the descriptive bibliographer. The purpose of including this one measurement in a catalogue entry generally stressing the content of works rather than the form of books is puzzling; and the four reasons furnished in a "Preliminary note" to this rule do nothing to suggest an answer. 40 First we are told, "The size of the work is included in the catalog entry as an aid in finding the work on the shelves." Of course "book" is meant instead of "work" in both instances, and this imprecision reflects a basic confusion as to the purpose of this information. The interest is unquestionably in the work, as stated, but the reason provided can only refer to the book; and locating a book by its size—even as a device to supplement other techniques—is certainly a primitive method of information retrieval. 41 The second stated reason for recording the height of a book is "as an aid to the user of the catalog in selecting a desirable edition." This preposterous point scarcely requires comment, for the correlation between the height of a binding and the desirability of the edition it covers would be relevant (if at all) only to the choice of books for reading in bed or for packing in luggage. The other two reasons are that the height "serves the reader who wishes to borrow the work through interlibrary loan or who wishes to order a photocopy of the work or a part of it." Again, "book" is meant; and the person who would be influenced by the height of the book in his request for a loan or a photocopy cannot be very seriously interested in the work it contains. The only justifiable reason for including the height of a binding in an entry oriented toward the content of the book is one that is not mentioned: the height could be regarded as a supplement to the pagination details, further indicating the extent of the work by suggesting the size of the pages. But this function—indicating "the space occupied by the work"—would be served still better by the specification of two or three dimensions, as required for broadsides (141E3) and "unusual formats" such as "boxes or cans" (141E6). The discussion of "size" (that is, height), as it stands, is not well thought through and provides no sensible reason for the inclusion of that detail; if no better reasons are to be offered, the requirement of specifying height is a flagrant example of the insistence on a physical detail which is unnecessary in relation to the emphasis of the entry and inadequate to serve as an aid to the physical bibliographer. 42 The rules for description in the North American Text of AACR developed from—and remained close to—those in the 1949 Rules for Descriptive Cataloging in the Library of Congress . And both these codes represent a considerable simplification of what had been proposed in 1941 in the "Preliminary American Second Edition" of the A. L. A. Catalog Rules . The pagination rules set forth there result in such illustrations as "xii p., 5 l., [3], 219 p." and "v, 365, [3] p., 2 l."— which suggest careful attention to physical details but are nevertheless intended to indicate the extent of the work, not of the book. One rule, for instance, states that "Blank leaves at the beginning of a book are not counted even if they have apparently been included in the paging"; and another requires that intermediate unpaged matter be reported as leaves "when some or all of the leaves are blank on one side, except that unpaged matter continuing the text from a preceding numbered page is given as a page, even if printed on a leaf one side of which is blank" (rules 271-272). Despite the elaboration of rules such as these, 43 the system does not manage unambiguously to convey just which pages contain printed matter (the number of blank pages in the groups designated as leaves in the illustrations cited above is not determinable from the formulas) 44 —and it certainly does not provide a register of all the pages in a book. Dissatisfaction with these proposed rules was fortunately widespread and began even before their publication, for a note facing the title page of the 1941 volume acknowledges that there had been "considerable disagreement as between some catalogers and some administrators." But the complaints and the ensuing discussions too often resulted merely in requests for simplification, without a reexamination of the underlying function of the catalogue entry—without, that is, exploring why the elaboration of detail did not further the aims of the entry. 45 The rules had indeed become too complex, but not in any absolute sense. They had become inappropriately complex because the complexity arose from the notation of physical details, when the function of the pagination record was to suggest the extent of the work and was not primarily concerned with the physical book. The resulting formula was bound to be an inefficient and finally unsuccessful instrument for conveying information about either the work or the book. It was more dramatically unsuccessful than the present rules; but they still suffer from the same confusion. Even the British Text of AACR , which is more logical in its presentation of rules for description and its requirements than the North American, 46 falters from indecision regarding the purpose of including physical details. The AACR treatment of pagination may look good in comparison with that in the complex 1941 rules; but the act of simplifying the rules has not altered the underlying problem which made those earlier rules unsatisfactory. Cataloguers and librarians themselves have been uneasily aware that the collation statement is a trouble spot, the treatment of which has never been satisfying. Herman H. Henkle, in the Studies of Descriptive Cataloging (1946) which formed part of the deliberation leading up to the 1949 Library of Congress Rules , summed up the problem: The question of the collation statement—whether its principal function is to characterize the contents of the book by describing its significant physical features, or whether it is to account in detail for the completeness of the volume—continues in a stalemate condition. Those who favor detailed collation maintain that it eliminates the exercise of judgment on the part of the cataloger; insures uniformity of result; assists in the identification of an edition, issue, or copy, and in the detection of an imperfect copy; and obviates any confusion to the inquirer checking in the catalog a reference containing the pages not shown in the collation of the entry. Those who favor brief collation do not think that these ends justify the means; they point to the collation of works in more than one volume as an indication that detailed collation is unnecessary; and they regard detailed collation as a dissipation of cataloging energy on the production of a result which is unintelligible to many users of the catalog. Comments and advice on this question are especially needed. (pp. 29-30) This passage is instructive: Henkle's opening statement accurately sets forth the issue; but his summary of the arguments on both sides shows how the discussion generally focuses on the amount of detail involved rather than on the alternative functions of the collation as expressed in his earlier comment. (Certainly the arguments of those favoring "brief collation," as recorded here, are extremely weak; but that does not mean that theirs is necessarily the weaker position, for their arguments simply do not touch the basic question.) 47 Some years after the Library of Congress Rules appeared, Leonard Jolley described Library of Congress cataloguing as "still avowedly bibliographical" 48 and questioned the value of including the collation at all, since without an identification of type sizes and layout the number of pages does not very accurately denote the size of the work and since the details provided "do not produce a statement of pagination upon which a bibliographer can rely in all cases" (p. 132). Like Henkle, he saw the central issue, and he stated it even more trenchantly: The weakness of the Library of Congress Rules is that they do not recognize sufficiently bluntly the essentially approximate nature of the information which is added to a catalogue entry not really because it helps identify a book but because it conveys some information of value about the book. As a result of this failure practices are sometimes prescribed which are not elaborate enough to provide a full bibliographical description and yet more elaborate than the ends they can achieve warrant. (pp. 133-134) With this kind of statement before them, the planners of AACR should have been able to confront the real problem and produce a set of rules for collation firmly based on a well-defined view of its purpose. Instead, it was decided that the discussions preceding the 1949 Rules constituted a largely sufficient basic reconsideration of the rules for description and that the rules for entry and heading were the ones which now demanded full-scale rethinking; 49 as a result the AACR rules for description are disappointingly similar, in their confused underlying principles, to what had existed before. This fact has not gone unobserved. Andrew Osborn has said, "I am much concerned because in the AA code the rules for descriptive detail are not in the same class as the rules for entry and heading." 50 And R. O. Linden has pointed out in AACR "a confusion in general between the bibliographical, and what might be termed the evaluative function of collation." 51 In his discussion of the rule regarding the date of a volume, he makes a comment about the meaning of "edition" which again would apply to other rules for description: "Two approaches appear possible—one, a definition that gives emphasis to the bibliographical character of the work, the second, a definition that is based on the intellectual content. Two values appear to be confused here" (p. 50). It is clear that this confusion has been recognized not only by descriptive bibliographers but by those within the library profession as well. Of course, as these comments suggest, it is not merely the collation line which reveals a confusion between books and works. I have concentrated on that part of the entry, particularly the pagination statement, as a telling illustration of the problem; but the problem is not confined to that element. For instance, the treatment of the title pages of books bears some awkward traces of a concern with physical detail. The basic rule for the "transcription" of title makes clear that a literal transcription is not intended, for exactness is required only "as to order, wording, spelling, accentuation, and other diacritical marks" but "not necessarily as to punctuation and capitalization." Furthermore, if "diacritical marks are omitted from the title page, they are added in conformity with the usage in the text" (134B1). The emphasis is clearly on the content of the title, not on its formal presentation or typographic layout. Yet when long titles are abridged (as they are "if this can be done without loss of essential information"), three dots are required to mark the ellipsis (134B2). This requirement is understandable when part of the title quoted follows the omission, for not to indicate the omission in such instances would simply be irresponsible quotation; but when the omission occurs at the end of the quoted part of the title, one could argue, as with ordinary quotations within a text, that the ellipsis dots are unnecessary. The recording of the title is admittedly a special type of quotation, since punctuation and capitalization need not be followed; but it nevertheless is a quotation (concerned with words and the accompanying marks conventional to the language), not quasi-facsimile transcription (concerned with the typography and layout in which those words and marks are presented). 52 Other recorded details, aside from titles (main titles, subtitles, series titles, and so on), need not be regarded as quotations, however, but as reports of information. Therefore, when the author's name is provided as the heading for the entry, it seems unnecessary to repeat the name following the title, as the basic rule requires (134D1). 53 The concern of this rule is obviously not with the physical form of the title page, because it recognizes that the author's name may have to be taken from a different position on the title page or even from somewhere else in the volume; but there is a lingering sense that the exact form in which an author's name appears in a book must be recorded, even when fuller information about him (his complete name and perhaps his dates) is already provided in the heading. In regard both to the ellipsis dots and to the repetition of the author's name, one could argue that in some cases their presence might suggest or convey important information (as when the form of the author's name on the title page is considerably different from his established name cited in the heading), and in these cases their inclusion would be justified, since the goal is to be informative regarding substantive, not formal, matters. But the criterion for inclusion, given the emphasis of the entry as a whole, must turn on the relevance of the detail as information about the work or author, not on an assumption that the mere physical presence of the detail in a particular form is relevant in itself. The treatment of some parts of the title page reflects this principle more firmly than that of other parts. If a subtitle, for example, is printed at the head of the title page, above the title, it is silently transposed to a position following the title in the entry (134C4b). 54 And the imprint is regularized into the order place-publisher-year, regardless of the order on the title page, and neither this rearrangement nor omissions of words need be specified (136A, 136C1, 138A). 55 The inconsistency in the handling of different parts of the title page is strikingly shown by the fact that data for the imprint statement can be taken from elsewhere in the book and recorded without brackets, 56 whereas the author's name must appear in brackets if it is taken from somewhere in the book other than the title page (132B, 134D1). 57 Few people, I think, would question the propriety of the rearrangement of the material so as to produce relatively uniform catalogue entries, and the fact that this approach is so widely accepted suggests a broad understanding—whether consciously expressed or not—that library catalogue entries serve largely a reference function. Even the descriptive bibliographer generally assigns a standardized title to each of his descriptions to aid the reader in locating them; his focus is of course on physical description, but that aspect of his work which involves reference bibliography entails standardization for efficiency of reference. The library cataloguer, unlike the descriptive bibliographer, is primarily concerned with reference bibliography, and thus the body of each of his entries can be expected to be a standardized presentation of facts, not a transcription of forms. In the AACR treatment of title-page information, those few rules which imply some obligation to offer physical description stand out, against this background, as incongruous and, indeed, confused. 58 It should come as no surprise that the emphasis of library cataloguing, as reflected in AACR , is on what may be called reference bibliography, where the primary concern is the intellectual content of books. Of the two conventional divisions of library cataloguing, subject cataloguing—or classification—obviously deals with content; what may be less clear at first is that the other division, so-called descriptive cataloguing, does so as well. 59 Because descriptive bibliography treats of books as physical objects, some confusion may be caused by the use of the term "descriptive cataloguing" to denote an activity which does not. The difficulty, however, is not entirely one of terminology. The present cataloguing code, AACR , in all its versions, states that "The collation is the cataloger's description of the physical work and is limited to standard bibliographical terminology" (132A; 1967 texts, 131). 60 Yet, as this examination of the rules for collation indicates, attention is not given to physical details for their own sake but as clues suggestive of the extent or nature of the work contained in the book being catalogued. The descriptive cataloguer's job, as set forth in these rules, has a basically different aim from that of the descriptive bibliographer, and the "standard bibliographical terminology" employed is not that which is standard in the field of descriptive bibliography. 61 What the library cataloguer normally means by "descriptive" is "annotated with certain largely physical details which help to characterize the content of a book." The objection to the cataloguer's practice, as codified in AACR , is not that he gives too much attention to the work and neglects the book: it is entirely proper that he should emphasize the work. The flaw in the AACR is that some of its recommendations for handling physical details reflect a failure to keep this goal firmly in mind and to recognize the relationships between reference and physical bibliography. The result is a lack of decisiveness and singleness of purpose in a number of rules, producing in turn certain data in a form not entirely appropriate to either interest. Descriptive bibliographers should have no quarrel with reference bibliography; but their respect for it is not likely to increase so long as it can appear at times as merely a less precise form of descriptive bibliography. Part II of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules , as a product of great deliberation and a document destined to have wide influence, is disappointing in that it is not able clearly to place its subject in relation to descriptive and reference bibliography and thus to offer rules informed by a well-defined point of view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III How to reconcile the practices of descriptive bibliography and library cataloguing in the area where the two fields overlap is a problem which has exercised many people over the years. If the Anglo-American code reflects little awareness of the issue, there has nevertheless been a succession of librarians who have touched on the matter, generally in connection with the cataloguing of rare books. Whereas one tradition of bibliographical writing, developing through Pollard, Greg, McKerrow, and Bowers, 62 has taken up the problems of description for those concerned with the physical book (and the use of physical evidence in historical and literary studies), another tradition has consisted of librarians writing for other librarians about the physical details appropriate for inclusion in the catalogue entries for certain classes of material. The two traditions intertwine occasionally, and such men as Esdaile, Cowley, Dunkin, Alden, and Bennett, addressing themselves to library cataloguers, are fully aware of the other tradition of writing about the description of books. Their discussions are worth surveying, as significant attempts to bring the two approaches together, even though their attention is primarily directed toward rare books and special collections, not toward the larger problem of general cataloguing. Arundell Esdaile, in A Student's Manual of Bibliography (1931), one of a series originally called "The Library Manuals," does attempt to encompass all kinds of cataloguing and begins his chapter on description with this statement: "Every catalogue-entry is a description of the book catalogued; but according to the purpose of the catalogue is the degree of elaboration of the description" (p. 248). What this pronouncement overlooks is the fact that a given purpose may be served by differing degrees of detail. By stating that "purpose" and "degree of elaboration" fluctuate together, it postulates a situation in which a shift in the aim of an entry entails a quantitative, rather than qualitative, shift in the annotation. Esdaile's four levels of description reflect the difficulties of this position. His "minimum entry" consists of nothing but title and author's name and is thus an entry for a work , even though the work must necessarily be represented in the library being catalogued by a particular copy. The next higher level, called "short-entry" (p. 249), records place and date, but the intention is not so much to identify a book as to specify a text of the work. Esdaile's illustration includes the symbol "12°," though he admits that such notation, as well as a statement of pagination, "serves little purpose here"—except that pagination would "distinguish a pamphlet from a substantial work." And he adds that size notation "seems to be entirely useless." The concern of the entry, in other words, is still with a work ; the increased detail does not stem from a different aim, though of course it allows the aim to be pursued with greater sophistication. The interest, clearly, is not in physical characteristics for their own sake. Esdaile's third level, the "short standard description," represents a "minimum standard" for all entries, since one "cannot be sure what book will become important, or what book will become rare" (p. 250). The entry now contains a quotation of the title with omissions noted and a record of format, signatures, pagination, and plates. Its emphasis is beginning to shift toward the physical and, one should observe, away from the individual copy, for the entry describes "firstly all copies, and secondly, the one copy" (p. 252). The highest level, the "full standard description," requires, among other things, quasi-facsimile transcription of the title page, a pagination statement showing which pages are numbered, information on type, and a detailed record of the contents (p. 253). It is designed to "anticipate as far as possible questions which may be asked about a book's physical and intellectual composition" (p. 250), yet the emphasis is definitely now on the side of the physical. Few people today would defend Esdaile's scheme, 63 largely because his inclusion of signature collation in a minimum entry is not a feasible requirement for routine library cataloguing. But a more basic weakness is theoretical: by shifting his emphasis as he moves to higher levels of detail, he is blurring the distinction between quantity of information (from simple enumeration to great detail) and orientation of approach (toward the work or the book). Nevertheless, he at least is confronting the problem of defining a framework which will embrace both a brief reference entry and an elaborate physical description. 64 Eight years later, J. D. Cowley addressed another book, Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing , to library-school students, setting out specifically to help them "distinguish sufficiently between what is appropriate to cataloguing and what is suitable in a published bibliography" (p. v). In a carefully considered introductory chapter, he segregates, much more successfully than Esdaile, the aims, and resulting methods, of physical and subject bibliography. Recognizing that differing aims dictate the nature of the details to be included in an entry, not their quantity, he says, "Minute description of the physical form of the material is therefore out of place" in a subject listing; "Description of physical features need only be sufficient to secure identification of the work or the edition which is described" (pp. 6-7). That is, the number of physical details can be reduced not because a subject list is a less detailed descriptive bibliography but because it is not concerned with physical books, except as necessary to locate the physical embodiments of works; if annotation is to be provided, it should be of a different kind. 65 Having laid this admirable foundation, Cowley is disappointing in his ensuing recommendations, as they relate to the stated problem of "what is appropriate to cataloguing and what is suitable in a published bibliography." His real interest is in the latter, and virtually his whole work is devoted to detailed descriptive bibliography (it is the most thorough pre-Bowers exposition of the subject). As far as library cataloguing is concerned, he is content to accept uncritically the Anglo-American code then in effect. At the start, he says that for subject bibliography "a simple catalogue entry, constructed according to one of the recognized codes of rules, is the best form of description" (p. 7). And in his chapter on format and collation, after eighteen pages on a method of format designation and a formulary for the recording of pagination and signatures, he appends four lines: "In short entries or entries for subject bibliographies the technical note should be reduced to the form adopted in the Anglo-American code, e.g. viii, 182, [10] p., illus., 10 plates, diagrs., 20 x 15 cm." (p. 106). It is clear that he equates library cataloguing in general with subject bibliography; but why the details for library cataloguing prescribed in the Anglo-American rules are appropriate for subject bibliography as defined in his opening chapter is never explored. Although his work makes a contribution to descriptive bibliography and offers a helpful theoretical distinction between that field and library cataloguing, he leaves the break between the two as ill-defined in practice as he found it. In 1951 Paul S. Dunkin's booklet on How to Catalog a Rare Book was published by the American Library Association. Like Cowley, Dunkin does not attempt to correlate reference and physical bibliography. Routine cataloguing has to do with subject matter: "People want to find an ordinary book because they want to read it. Simplified cataloging serves well enough for such a book because it gives a call number and tells what the book is about" (p. 1). A rare book, on the other hand, is of interest as a physical object: "If people wanted only to read it, a microfilm or reprint would do. The fact that the rare book is valued as a material object must be the keynote of any useful approach to rare book cataloging." The booklet proceeds to offer an introduction to title-page transcription, determination of format, and the recording of signatures and pagination—the "cataloging problems peculiar to rare books" (p. 2)—without further considering what rationale underlies the segregating of certain books for this treatment. 66 Indeed, the cataloguer is not supposed to think about this question: "it is not," he says, "the cataloger's job to decide if a book is rare; that has been decided before the book reached his desk." But someone had to make a decision, for the dividing line between "rare books" and others is not self-evident, nor therefore is the division between books of interest for their content and books of interest as physical objects. Obviously any book can be of interest for either reason; but despite the title of his opening chapter, "Whys and Wherefores," Dunkin does not conceive of his task as involving any examination of such matters. Instead, he concentrates on particulars of form and is at pains to show that the recording of physical details need not be complex, as in his recommendation for "collation by gatherings in simple language" (p. 82). He insists that what he is talking about is "simplified cataloging," not descriptive bibliography of the kind treated in Bowers's Principles . 67 "A cataloger," he adds, "tells only what a rare book looks like; a bibliographer tells how it came to look that way" (p. 1). In taking this position he is creating a false opposition, implying first that the difference between a catalogue and a bibliography lies in the amount of detail and then, rather confusingly, suggesting that the difference results from the presence or absence of analysis. 68 His later writings continue to make these points and show an increasing irritation with the practices of descriptive bibliographers. In the preface to the 1973 revised edition of this booklet he expresses "surprise" at the wide acceptance of Bowers's "highly complicated collation formula" and hopes that "catalogers will never . . . use the Bowers formula in their entries." 69 The new edition "tries to make the Bowers formula easy for catalogers to understand" only because they may have to consult printed bibliographies which employ it. Yet his comparison of Bowers's system and his own "simpler" one (in a section entitled "Collation: Cataloger and Bibliographer," pp. 94-97) succeeds only in demonstrating the superiority of Bowers's formula, not merely in conciseness but in clarity as well, 70 and in showing that the rumors of its difficulty had been greatly exaggerated. 71 More recently, in Bibliography: Tiger or Fat Cat? (1975), he has repeated his attacks on Bowers's system, concluding that "the space saved by shorthand notation is more apparent than real" (p. 28)—as if conciseness were the only reason for it. He also dismisses the descriptive bibliographer's definitions of "issue" and "state" as "jargon," though "harmless" (p. 18)—as if the lack of careful definitions would not lead to sloppy thinking. His resentment emerges in irony at times, as when he labels the cataloguer a "Country Cousin" and says, "In the hierarchy of Bibliography the cataloger stands lowest of the low" (p. 29). It is unfortunate that he chooses to pursue this unconstructive approach, which can do nothing to promote greater understanding and cooperation between cataloguers and bibliographers. In contrast, John E. Alden, in his excellent essay on "Cataloging and Classification" for the Association of College and Research Libraries' Rare Book Collections (1965), 72 stresses the mutually fruitful relationship that can exist between the two groups. He calls rare-book cataloguing "bibliographical cataloging" (p. 68) and sees the cataloguer as a person with "a great opportunity to render a particular, not to say unique, service to the scholar—the opportunity to describe individual books analytically and to achieve significant patterns either by the correlation of these descriptions or, by means of classification, by the correlation of the books themselves" (p. 65). 73 But in order to play this creative role, Alden believes, the cataloguer must also learn from the scholar and keep abreast of developments in analytical bibliography and textual study. To say that the rare-book cataloguer can ignore those developments or that he can follow the standard cataloguing codes is "a counsel of despair": "The more productive view is certainly that the 'new bibliography' is the province not only of the avowed bibliographer but also of the rare book cataloger, who in the course of his day-to-day activity has occasion to contribute to knowledge and to scholarship by his own discoveries or by making possible discoveries at the hands of others" (p. 67). Although Alden does make some specific recommendations, he places his emphasis "on ends rather than on means," feeling that cataloguers have given too little attention to "what purpose cataloging served"; formal matters will be handled imaginatively, in response to a given situation, by the cataloguer who is "a humanist before he is a technician" (p. 73). Alden does not therefore address himself to the evaluation of particular systems for recording details in physical and in reference bibliography; but his view that the card catalogue "is adaptable enough to serve the objectives of both rare book cataloging and general cataloging" (p. 68) presupposes a basic compatibility among entries prepared with different aims in mind. 74 The world of cataloguing which emerges from Alden's pages is far removed from the one Dunkin writes about; it is surely the more rewarding one to inhabit. The approach which Alden describes in general terms is the one which underlies the detailed specifications set forth by Josiah Q. Bennett in his impressive booklet on The Cataloguing Requirements of the Book Division of a Rare Book Library (1969). 75 Bennett's thorough treatment of the form and nature of the elements required in an adequate catalogue entry for a "rare book" is concerned both with upholding scholarly standards and with recognizing practical realities. It is grounded in the belief, first, that library cataloguing of rare books—which necessarily emphasizes physical details—need provide only enough information for identification, not the greater quantity required for true description (e.g., pp. 8, 29); second, that careful initial cataloguing is more economical than the repeated investigation which would otherwise be necessary to answer inquiries or check dealers' catalogues (p. 10); and, third, that standard Library of Congress entries can be converted, with a minimum of adjustment, to serve as informative basic entries for rare books, leaving plenty of space on the cards, in most cases, for the additional required data (e.g., pp. 41-42). His recommendations on particulars, therefore, naturally throw into relief the differences between ordinary LC entries and bibliographical cataloguing. For example, he underscores the absolute necessity of recording the characteristics of the actual copy at hand, not the ideal copy (pp. 19-20); he explains the usefulness of noting format, even for modern books; he rejects the measurement of the spine to the nearest centimeter in favor of measuring the sheets to the nearest millimeter (pp. 21-22); and he denounces the policy of confining "the page collation to the mere recording of the last page number found," which "has absolutely no place in rare book or special collections cataloguing" because it fails to take account of initial and terminal blanks or advertisements (pp. 18-19). Although he is making these criticisms of conventional library practice only in regard to rare-book cataloguing, his comments suggest the further question whether that practice is really appropriate to any cataloguing. A hint of this question comes to the surface when he speaks of "the decision to 'short catalogue,' not in the sense of eliminating detail unnecessary to the service of any particular type of library but in the sense of requiring inaccuracy for a presumed (one wonders if an actual) saving of time, as in 'last numbered page' collation and inaccurate measurement" (p. 45). 76 It is beyond the scope of his essay to pursue the implications of this remark outside the rare-book field—that is, outside the area where interest in the physical book predominates. But his underlying concern with the split between the two ways of looking at books permeates his discussion, and the general problem is treated with understanding and insight in his opening section, on the "Rationale" of rare-book cataloguing, and in his closing section, on "The Indicated Symbiosis." The two groups that must learn to be symbiotic are of course those persons interested in information and text retrieval on the one hand and those interested in "bibliographical data retrieval," as Bennett puts it, on the other. The average library cataloguer holds a belief— fostered by library schools 77 because of the "overwhelming preponderancy and influence of the informational library" (p. 46)—that "the basic purpose of cataloguing is simply the identification of a text in an informational series to the exclusion of all other factors " (p. 44). Bennett realizes that "serial identification" is also part of the task of the rare-book cataloguer, and thus the symbiosis between "serial" and "bibliographical" identification begins with the card entries prepared for the former purpose: while these entries may not be sufficient in depth for bibliographical purposes, they are sufficient to the serial identificational process for rare books if the cataloguer is allowed to develop the entries to the limits of accuracy of which they are reasonably and practically capable. Therefore, let these entries be made in this manner for this specific purpose. Beginning with the note, let the necessary entries for bibliographical identification and physical description be made as efficiently as possible for these specific purposes. The realities of space and time should be considered, and one card made to serve where possible, but the rigors of bibliographical accuracy must be maintained. There is space for both identifications, and such space is essentially provided by the semantic division of the card between serial formula and note. The two identifications can be made on the same card, and are not in any sense exclusive of each other. A symbiosis is not only possible and necessary but also may be achieved without difficulty under the present system. (pp. 45-46) This solution is not simply determined by the exigencies of economics; the basic card entry makes a positive contribution to the final expanded entry. The symbiosis, in practical terms, is feasible; what is more difficult to achieve is mutual understanding among persons with differing habits of thought. As Bennett points out, the rare-book cataloguer must have "a habit of mind flexible enough to approach each book brought before it as an entity in itself" (p. 42), not merely as a unit in a series. The development of this habit of mind is crucial to the symbiosis, and one of the merits of Bennett's treatment is that he recognizes questions of personality as well as of bibliographical theory. 77a It is natural that discussions of the relation between reference and physical bibliography have generally addressed themselves to problems of rare books and special collections. Cataloguing codes from Cutter to AACR have generally included a section on incunabula, 78 thus tacitly admitting to any user of the codes that certain situations demand fuller attention to physical details than the basic rules allow for. But since no clear dividing line separates "rare books" from other books, the thoughtful reader of these codes will be moved to reexamine those basic rules. Bennett has shown what can be done with a minimum of effort to convert a standard entry into a satisfactory entry for a "rare book"—a book, that is, the physical features of which are, or can be anticipated to be, of interest because it falls into a category of books frequently approached in that way. Any book, however, no matter how unlikely the choice, may be studied as a physical object, the product of a certain moment in printing and publishing history. But if the conversion of a typical card entry into one appropriate for physical study entails the addition of several pieces of information, it is obviously unrealistic to ask that all books be catalogued as if they were "rare books." What can be done is to look at the matter from the other direction: instead of examining what needs to be added to a routine entry for the purposes of physical bibliography, one can ask to what extent the elements present in the routine entry are useful to the physical bibliographer. In other words, recognizing that for practical reasons the majority of books will be catalogued with a minimum of elaboration and that some essentially physical details will be included even in catalogue entries primarily intended to serve a reference function, one can ask whether those physical details are presented in a form which seems sensible—or at least is not misleading—to the physical bibliographer. To ask this is to ask whether it is not possible to refer to physical details unambiguously in all entries. I should like to suggest a way of answering this question, taking the statement of pagination as my illustration—both because I concentrated on pagination in my comments on the Anglo-American rules and because the record of pagination is (among the elements included in an LC entry) of particular interest to physical bibliographers. Some of the problems involved in integrating the approaches of reference and physical bibliography toward pagination can be suggested by the practices of two bibliographers, one attempting to incorporate into a descriptive bibliography the pagination formula employed on LC cards and the other trying to devise a formula for brief catalogue entries that would have the precision expected by descriptive bibliographers. Donald Gallup, in his bibliographies of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, gives pagination in a system adapted from the 1949 Library of Congress Rules . He says, "I have modified the system, which ignores blanks and leaves containing only advertisements, in order to account for all leaves, although blank pages are not mentioned." 79 When the preliminary pages add up to the total implied by the first numbered page, they are not specified; but when there would be a discrepancy in the numbering, the preliminaries are specified in leaves, with an indication of which are blank: "1 blank leaf, 3 leaves, 9-29 pp." At the end of a volume, a single blank verso is not mentioned ("29 pp." implies that page 30 is blank), but a single unnumbered verso with printed matter is indicated ("29, [1] pp."). When more leaves follow, the number is recorded, with those blank on both sides being labeled "blank." Thus the notation "29 pp., 1 leaf" means, in Gallup's explanation, that "the text ends on page 29 and that additional material not a continuation of the text appears on a final unnumbered leaf, either recto or verso or both being printed." Because Gallup's system is intended for descriptive bibliography, it properly emphasizes physical details, recognizing that all leaves which form part of the printed gatherings must be recorded. But in two respects, influenced by the LC rules, it does not consistently stress physical form. First, the decision not to indicate which preliminary pages are unnumbered when their total matches the sequence established by the first numbered page means that the physical detail of printed page numbers is regarded as of secondary importance at the front of a book (whereas a notation like "29, [1] pp." suggests that it is primary at the end of a book, since no pagination is inferred there). Second, the distinction between "29 pp." and "29, [1] pp." reflects a concern with the content of a page (since the thirtieth page exists physically in either case), whereas for the later leaves or the preliminaries the only concern is with knowing the number of physical leaves, not which individual pages among those leaves are blank. 80 Gallup's experiment is interesting, but there remains in his formula a conflict between those details of physical and those of reference emphasis. The context is one of physical bibliography, and the intrusion of elements relating more to content than to form lessens the value of the formula as a physical record. Rolf Du Rietz's experiment, in his Bibliotheca Polynesiana , illustrates a somewhat different problem. His goal is to work out a pagination formula for reference bibliography—not, like Gallup, for physical bibliography. Yet he believes, with Gallup, that all leaves must be accounted for; he believes, in other words, that a pagination statement for reference bibliography must be more than an approximate indication of the extent of a work—it must be an accurate representation of the physical book in terms of pagination. "One of the aims of a page formula," he says, "must always be that of making possible references to any pages in the unit described, and to meet this and the other purposes of a page formula, it is absolutely necessary to assume a purely analytical approach to the problem of collational formulas for the purposes and needs of reference bibliography" (p. xli). The formula he proposes (and uses in his catalogue) is made up of two elements: a listing of the total number of pages in each sequence of pagination (inferring page numbers wherever possible), in the form "xii + 268 pp."; and parenthetical indications of which leaves are blank or devoted to advertisements, using a set of abbreviations, such as "BL" for "blank leaf (or leaves)," "FLA" for "first leaf (leaves) advertisements," "LLBA" for "last leaves blank (one or more) and advertisements (one or more)," and so on. A hypothetical collation which Du Rietz offers as an illustration takes this form: "[πIV] (BL) + xii (FLA) + 268 + 369-800 (3 LLB) + 2 32 (FLB, 2 LLA) + 3 98 (3 FLBA, 4 LLBA) + XVI + (8) pp." Of course, most actual books are not likely to be so complicated: entry 168, for instance, reads "xx + 344 (LLB) pp.," and entry 15 reads "280 (2 FLB, LLB) pp." The trouble with this system is that its complications arise from the inclusion of information not directly relevant to the reference function of the entries, yet not really sufficient for physical bibliography either. For reference purposes, the extent of the work is the central fact to be communicated by the pagination statement; therefore Du Rietz's inclusion in the record of all the leaves (except binder's leaves) in the physical book necessitates his insertion of explanatory parentheses to account for those leaves which are not part of the work . 81 But this elaboration of statement does not turn the record into one appropriate for physical bibliography, as Du Rietz recognizes: "a page-collation formula in reference bibliography is normally not concerned with the individual numbering of each page" (it records " sequences of pagination") and "should thus not be confused with pagination statements (or formulas) of the kind given in descriptive bibliography" (p. xliii). One of the principal expressions of his rationale illustrates the essential problem: It seems to me that the very concept of collation implies completeness, and I can see no real reason why a page-collation system should not aim at completeness to exactly the same extent as the analytical system employed by descriptive bibliography. If a page collation serves any real purpose at all (more than that of giving the reader a very rough notion of the bulk of the work described, a purpose which may be achieved by far less expensive and less complicated methods than those commonly employed today), it has to aim at completeness and at being able to serve as the page-collation equivalent of a full analytical formula. This cannot, as a rule, be achieved without basing the collation on some elementary kind of analytical investigation of the unit involved (even though the page formula itself does not necessarily reflect the physical structure of the unit—the actual pagination frequently does not). (p. xl) As this passage reveals, his system falls between two stools: the extent or bulk of a work could be indicated much more simply, and in order to be a "real analytical formula" (p. xliv) still more information would have to be given. 82 Du Rietz is right to observe that the pagination formulas in library catalogue entries frequently do not reflect any clear understanding of the purposes they are to serve. 83 But his own proposal seems to me, both on theoretical and on practical grounds, not to provide the answer. The theoretical problem results from his unwillingness to let the pagination formula in reference bibliography refer solely to the extent of the work. So long as one insists that the formula have a physical orientation, even in a reference context, and yet does not require it to conform to the practices of descriptive bibliography, the purposes of the formula are bound to be somewhat confused. Du Rietz asserts, "Since hardly any of the thousands of page collations for reference bibliographical purposes that are every week constructed all over the world are analytically conceived, it follows that they might as well have been left unwritten and that they mean a tremendous waste of time, labour and money" (p. xl). Then he adds, "I do not say that a page-collation formula in reference bibliography should conform to the standards required for the pagination formulas supplementing the analytical formulas in descriptive bibliography." Why not? Is it not also a waste of time to have people learn an intermediate system, when an unambiguous system already exists for recording pagination from a physical point of view? The theoretical consideration is thus linked to the practical one: any solution to the problem of appropriate pagination formulas must be based on a realistic assessment of the feasibility of its adoption. The farther it departs from standard practices, already widely understood, the less its chances of ready acceptance, unless what it proposes is so obviously necessary that no resistance is conceivable. Du Rietz realizes that his system will require additional "training in analytical and descriptive bibliography" for cataloguers (p. xl), but he regards that fact as an advantage, since such training would help to promote rigorous standards in the field. 84 Of course, bibliographical training is an asset; but requiring an analytical approach to the pagination of every book and a special system (different from that in descriptive bibliography) for recording pagination is bound to work against the acceptability of the system. "I am aware," Du Rietz remarks, "that what has been said above may not be altogether agreeable to many librarians and reference bibliographers, but I assure them that there really is no choice" (p. xli). My belief is that a choice does exist, but Du Rietz's discussion is valuable in raising the issues and in pointing the way toward a more workable solution. 85 Let us postulate a book which would have the following pagination formula in a descriptive bibliography (following Bowers's Principles ): pp. [i-v] vi-viii [ix] x-xi [xii-xiii] xiv-xvii [xviii-xx], [1] 2-275 [276-277] 278-283 [284-288]. 86 If one is interested in a physical record of pagination, it would be hard to improve on this approach. The great advantages of this formula are that it is readily understandable and that its construction does not require subjective or time-consuming decisions. Indeed, there are no special rules to be learned, except for an agreement never to link with a hyphen an inferred and a printed page number. When, in a reference bibliography, one wishes to pay particular attention to physical details, it seems pointless to construct a new system when an established one of such simplicity and clarity exists. This kind of formula may be somewhat longer for most books than the kind traditionally required for library catalogues, but whether its construction in most cases would take much (if any) longer is doubtful. And the reader who wishes to know only the extent of the work can tell from this formula just as readily as from "xvii, 283 p." what the approximate length is. Of course, the formula does not indicate the contents of any page, because in a descriptive bibliography a contents paragraph would follow; if this formula were used in a reference bibliography, the bibliographer might wish sometimes to specify separately the contents of certain pages, as "Checklist, pp. [277-284]; advertisements, pp. [285-286]; blank, pp. [i-ii], [287-288]." 87 Du Rietz's system, which would produce "xx (FLB) + 288 (2 LLBA) pp." is undeniably more concise, but it is far from self-explanatory and much less informative—for (like Gallup's system) it does not specify blank pages but only whole blank leaves, 88 and it does not attempt to show which pages are numbered. If the pagination record is going to be of use to physical bibliographers, the longer formula is so much more straightforward and precise as to outweigh whatever slight saving of time or space an abbreviated formula effects. 89 After all, the reason for complicating the pagination statement in the first place is to provide physical information, and it does not seem worthwhile to introduce complications without going far enough to achieve an unambiguous physical record. I am not suggesting, however, that a full pagination formula of the kind employed in descriptive bibliography is appropriate for the majority of entries in a library catalogue or a checklist at the end of a book or any other bibliographical work emphasizing reference bibliography. 90 My point is that whenever a library cataloguer or reference bibliographer wishes (for whatever reason he finds persuasive) to include information about the physical details of pagination, he would be better advised to adopt the formula of descriptive bibliography than to settle for some intermediate scheme which only partially accomplishes his purpose. But the corollary is that in most instances, when he is concerned solely with reference bibliography, he need not complicate his statement at all with physical details. For the hypothetical book under discussion, why could he not simply say "xvii, 284 pp." (or, adding the two figures, "301 pp.")? 91 According to the Anglo-American rules he would have to say "xvii, 283 [1] p.," including the "[1]" only because the 284th page, containing part of a checklist, would be referred to in a note. Or if the printed matter in the preliminaries extended to page [xix], why should he not say "xix, 284 pp." (or "303 pp.")? If reference bibliography is a legitimate pursuit, as it plainly is, there is no reason to insist that entries devised for reference purposes should satisfy the demands of physical bibliography. Where library cataloguing rules for pagination have generally gone astray is in paying too much attention to the physical details of pagination when the interest of the entry is in the extent of the work. Why should a work be labeled as "283 p." merely because the last page number is "283," when the last page of printed matter is actually the 284th page? If the concern is with the extent of the work, that extent might as well be recorded as accurately as possible, especially since the presence or absence of a printed page number is a detail of typographic design irrelevant in this context. 92 Or why should the work be listed as "283, [1] p.," giving the impression of a fidelity to physical detail which is not only beside the point but in fact not true? I do not see why a descriptive bibliographer should be bothered by an entry in a reference bibliography which simply records the total number of pages occupied by a work in a given embodiment. What is objectionable is a reference entry which appears to be concerned with the physical details of pagination but in fact is not fully committed to recording them and is therefore misleading and inaccurate. Either a pagination statement should aim solely at indicating the extent of a work , ignoring both the typographic form of the pagination and such nontextual features as blank pages, advertisements, and colophons (but not appendixes or indexes); or else it should offer a full and dependable accounting of all the pages in a book , showing exactly which ones are numbered and in what form. A simple convention would serve to distinguish the two: the former would follow the pattern "284 p." or "284 pp.," in which the abbreviation for "pages" follows a numerical total; the latter would take the form "pp. [1] 2-283 [284-288]," in which the abbreviation for "pages" precedes an indication of numerical sequence(s). Both systems are easy for the bibliographer to employ and easy for the user of a catalogue or bibliography to understand; each is appropriate in different situations and is recognizable for what it is. Neither reflects an indecisiveness as to its purpose: each is efficiently constructed in accordance with the aims of one branch of bibliography. It is true, as Du Rietz says, that "One of the most urgent needs of reference bibliography is the working out of adequate rules for page collations" (p. xl). What I have tried to suggest here is that a sensible solution can only flow from a clear understanding of the aims of and relations between reference and physical bibliography. Pagination is not the only problem, and I hope that what I have said offers an approach, a way of thinking, which can be applied to other elements of an entry, such as the recording of dimensions or the quoting of titles. The work of reference and physical bibliographers inevitably overlaps, and fruitful cooperation between them must rest on mutual respect and a recognition that each will need to draw on the expertise of the other. A physical bibliographer, in the aspects of his work which touch reference bibliography (such as establishing headings or classifications, indexing, citing particular libraries, and the like), should be glad to avail himself of the established practices which result from the accumulated experience of workers specializing in that field. Similarly, a reference bibliographer, in the parts of his work which impinge on physical bibliography (such as recording certain basically physical details like pagination), should turn for advice to those who specialize in studying the physical book and who have developed conventions for expressing their findings about physical form. In neither situation is it necessary to import a highly technical approach from the other field if it would be excessive in the context; but whatever is adopted should seem sensible to the specialists in the other field and be compatible with their approach. Library cataloguers, for instance, need not employ the full pagination formulas of descriptive bibliography; but their formulas should then be unambiguously focused on the content of the books, so that no one will mistake them for attempts to record physical facts. And when a need does arise for paying more attention to the physical book, they have the descriptive bibliographer's system to turn to. 93 Much has been made of the difficulty of the formulas and terminology employed in descriptive bibliography and of the fact that a library cataloguer cannot speak to the user of the catalogue through a preface explaining his system. 94 But the standard formulas of descriptive bibliography are not complex, except in the case of complicated books which would be likely to require more complex formulas under any system. An unfamiliar convention often appears to be more difficult than it really is, but the presence of a full descriptive pagination formula on a library card—without explanation—could not possibly prevent anyone unacquainted with the system from extracting the information he wished about the length of the work. To some extent a conflict is unavoidable between what A. Hugh Chaplin calls "tradition" and "principle." 95 The traditional practices of a field may restrict its receptivity to new approaches which are possibly more logical; yet tradition is important in maintaining stability and uniformity. Chaplin urges cataloguers—in their role as reference bibliographers—to be responsive to the requests for information from those who use their entries. He says that revisers of cataloguing codes "must adapt their rules to development and change in the user's tradition, the expectations of people using the catalogue, and where this would be hindered by their own habits, their own tradition, the cataloguer's tradition must be disregarded" (p. 11). But, as he recognizes, "The difficulty is that the expectations of the users of catalogues are inconsistent and variable, while the rules must conform to a system. The solution is to make general rules, which conform to generally prevalent expectations." When physical details are incorporated in a reference entry, the professional approach is to attempt to satisfy the prevalent expectations of physical bibliographers. And in the reverse situation, the physical bibliographer should of course meet the expectations of reference bibliographers. A century ago Charles A. Cutter concisely described the attitude which stands in the way of this kind of cooperation when he said, speaking of the reaction of catalogue-users to schemes of subject classification, "The reader at first glance is frightened by the appearance of a system to be learned and perversely regards it as a hinderance instead of an assistance." 96 All fields probably have some needless jargon; but for precise and efficient communication they must also have technical vocabularies and conventional forms. It is perhaps natural to be apprehensive about unfamiliar systems. But if we can learn to approach fields related to our own in an open-minded and positive spirit, assuming that they have someing to teach us which will be helpful in our own field, we will be well on the way toward achieving the advances which cooperation naturally produces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Library Quarterly , 11 (1941), 393-411. The historical position of this essay is commented upon in some of the works mentioned in note 23 below, especially those by Dunkin. Earlier Osborn had touched on "the very important question in cataloging theory as to the relation between bibliography and cataloging" and called for a "new theory of the dictionary catalog," in "Cataloging Costs and a Changing Conception of Cataloging," Catalogers' and Classifiers' Yearbook , 5 (1936), 45-54 (esp. 48-49). 2 See p. 61 of his "Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices," SB , 22 (1969), 1-75. 3 Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description (1970), p. 26. 4 See, for instance, the papers referred to at the end of note 85 below. 5 See Information on the MARC System (3rd ed., 1973), which includes a checklist of relevant items, pp. 37-44; for the International Standard Bibliographic Description, see note 26 below. 6 They can, for the moment, be called "books"; I shall take up below the significance of calling them that and the question whether they should at times be called something else. 7 Although a list of books available from a publisher is often called a "catalogue," it is not a catalogue in the sense defined here; each entry in a publisher's list refers not to a specific copy but to any or all copies of the item in question. (The same might be said of a new-book dealer's "catalogue" listing books which the dealer can procure on demand but which are not actually in stock.) 8 Rolf Du Rietz has explored this distinction between catalogues and bibliographies in detail in the preface to his Bibliotheca Polynesiana : A Catalogue of Some of the Books in the Polynesiana Collection Formed by the Late Bjarne Kroepelien and Now in the Oslo University Library (1969), pp. xix-xxviii. The principal point I have been making is the one on which his discussion also is based: "the great difference between catalogues and bibliographies in respect of the Platonic 'idea' of the copy behind the description is . . . so obvious, so utterly significant, that it seems the only sound ground upon which to base a definition of the two terms" (p. xxiv). Fredson Bowers makes the same distinction more concisely in "The Function of Bibliography," Library Trends , 7 (1958-59), 497-510 (esp. 500-503). 9 For instance, Edward A. Petherick said in July 1897 that catalogues were becoming so full of details "that it is difficult to say where cataloguing ends and bibilography begins" (p. 148), in "Theoretical and Practical Bibliography," Transactions and Proceedings of the Second International Library Conference (1898), pp. 148-149. A. W. Pollard, writing on "The Relations of Bibliography and Cataloguing" in the same volume, pp. 63-66, said that the librarian's work "necessarily becomes bibliographical" when his library has two editions of the same work, because he is "bound in some way to show how they differ" (p. 65). Georg Schneider, in Theory and History of Bibliography (trans. Ralph R. Shaw, 1934), where "bibliography" is used only in the sense of a reference list, states that "the entries in catalogs must be brief; entries in bibliographies must be accurate and complete, for they serve to supplement the former" (p. 51). See also Frank L. Tolman, "Bibliography and Cataloging: Some Affinities and Contrasts," Public Libraries , 10 (1905), 119-122; and Henry B. Van Hoesen, "Short Cataloguing and Bibliographical Cataloguing," American Library Institute Papers and Proceedings 1921, pp. 15-41. 10 In "Bibliography Revisited," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 89-128, reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography , Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 151-195, Bowers makes the same point: "The fullest description ever compiled would be a mere catalogue entry if based on the examination of only a single copy" (p. 194). When he goes on, however, to say, "It is the matter of standards of examination, quite apart from the differing forms of the entry, that distinguishes descriptive from enumerative bibliography," the issues become less clear, because "enumerative bibliography" is not synonymous with "cataloguing." Indeed, the preceding sentence has made clear that the form of the entry does not distinguish bibliographies and catalogues, and "enumerative bibliography" here must mean a listing with few details. In that case, one can see what Du Rietz objects to in Bowers's statement: "the very form of the entries," Du Rietz says, "is exactly what determines whether the list (bibliography or catalogue) is of the descriptive or of the enumerative (i.e. reference) kind, the standards of examination behind the form indicating solely the degree of quality of the list" ( Bibliotheca Polynesiana , p. lix). Certainly a cataloguer could set for himself as high a standard of examination of copies as a descriptive bibliographer, but the resulting work, containing descriptions of particular copies, would still be a catalogue. It is not the standards themselves which determine the genre of the work produced but the intent of the compiler as to the subject matter of the entries (that is, whether they refer to particular or ideal copies). When Du Rietz proceeds to point out that the "standards of examination are necessarily always more or less poor in entries for descriptive catalogues" and that such entries "must by their very nature always be more or less preliminary," he begins to blur the essential distinction, for it is not in the nature of a catalogue to be preliminary but simply to be a record of specific copies. (Cf. his comments on p. xxi.) If his phrases "necessarily always" and "by their very nature always" were each replaced with "usually" his statement would be a fair generalization about actual practice and would not imply that something in the very concept of a catalogue prevents it from representing more than a certain limited amount of research. (Whether or not Du Rietz should have equated "enumerative" and "reference" bibliography, as he does in the comment quoted earlier, is a separate question; the meaning of "reference" bibliography will be considered below.) In his Principles , Bowers suggests that the term "bibliographical catalogue" be used "when the high requirements of bibliographies have not been completely met either in the number of copies compared or in the method of examination" (p. 5). So long as this term is carefully defined as a technical expression, it can of course serve this purpose. But less confusion would be likely to result if "catalogue" were reserved strictly for works listing specific copies; to employ it in a phrase like "bibliographical catalogue" to designate a work which does not meet the requirements for a descriptive bibliography is to encourage the fallacy that a catalogue is simply an inferior bibliography, rather than a work with basically different aims. Cf. the similar objections raised by Lloyd Hibberd, Library , 5th ser., 20 (1965), 130, n. 5, and Du Rietz, p. xx, n. 3. 11 As he puts it, the modern concept of "bibliographic cataloging" reflects the recognition "that the book (i.e., the material record) and the work (i.e., the intellectual product embodied in it) are not coterminous" (p. 99). For Rolf Du Rietz's extended discussion of the same distinction, see his essay cited in note 15 below and "The Concept of 'Bibliotype,'" Text , 1 (1974), 78-92 (esp. 82-85). Various earlier writers have of course noted this distinction as well: e.g., see J. D. Cowley, Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing (1939), pp. 6-7; Thomas Franklin Currier, "What the Bibliographer Says to the Cataloger," Catalogers' and Classifiers' Yearbook , 9 (1941), 21-37 (p. 26: "In general it is safe to say that the cataloger should be more concerned with the substance and content of the book than with its physical form and make-up"); Pierce Butler, "The Cultural Function of the Library," Library Quarterly , 22 (1952), 79-91 (p. 88: a book as "so much matter" or as a "system of ideas"). 12 A good historical survey of opinion on this question is provided by Raynard Swank in "Subject Catalogs, Classifications, or Bibliographies? A Review of Critical Discussions, 1876-1942," Library Quarterly , 14 (1944), 316-332. 13 From p. 97 of the concluding chapter, "Bibliographic Dimensions in Information Control," pp. 97-113, written in collaboration with Robert M. Hayes; this chapter was also published in American Documentation , 20 (1969), 247-252. 14 "Physical and Reference Bibliography," Library , 5th ser., 20 (1965), 124-134. Hibberd conveniently brings together relevant comments from Fredson Bowers, Verner Clapp, Louise-Noëlle Malclès, and others. 15 "What Is Bibliography?", Text , 1 (1974), 6-40. Although the discussion which follows takes issue with Du Rietz occasionally, my conclusions have much in common with his. Cf. note 21 below. 16 Whether enough information is provided to identify texts is another question. The word "text" can have both a concrete and an abstract meaning: it can refer to the inked type-images in a given copy of a book, or it can signify a particular arrangement of words, abstracted from any particular physical embodiment. Du Rietz calls the first an "actual text" and the second an "ideal text," which can be either a "version" or a "work" (p. 11). What distinguishes a version from a work, however, is a difficult matter; see, for instance, G. T. Tanselle, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," SB , 29 (1976), 167-211. 17 He does not claim that it is necessarily less detailed, for he notes that the results of both kinds of bibliography can be recorded in lists (p. 23); he does, however, imply an ascending order, leading up from "humble" reference checklists to physical bibliography "on the highest level" (p. 26). He defines reference bibliography as "the activity of collecting, selecting, arranging, and sometimes also commenting upon information relating solely to the existence and relevance of such particular books as are united by a least common denominator selected as the basis for the bibliographer's work" (p. 23). But he goes on to say that the least common denominator is usually of a literary kind and that "the ultimate purpose is to list works ." It is difficult to see, therefore, how his definition would operate in practice to keep the focus of reference bibliography on books rather than works. 18 Hibberd makes the sensible suggestion that the word "description" should be reserved for "external description" and that "internal description" should be called "annotation" (see his discussion of these and the related terms "critical" and "analytical" on pp. 131-132). The ambiguous use of "description" in library cataloguing is commented on below. 19 Similarly, both catalogues and bibliographies which lack detail can be called "checklists" or "handlists," but their differing functions remain as before. Indeed, it would seem preferable to use "checklist" or "handlist" in such cases, so as to give the reader an indication of the amount of detail to be expected. But "bibliography" has been so widely used for so many years to signify an enumerative list as well as a detailed one that it seems futile at this late date to attempt to alter the usage. Careful writers, however, will continue to make the distinction. 20 A different sort of diagram, which makes some of the same points, appears in William J. Cameron, Brian J. McMullin, and Joginder K. Sood, The HPB Project : Phase II (1970), p. 3. It, like mine, attempts to show that both reference and physical bibliography can be undertaken at any level of detail, by equating the vertical axis with "elaborateness of description" and the horizontal with "the degree of attention to the physical character of the book on the one hand or to the intellectual content of the book on the other" (p. 2). However, I think that their diagram is somewhat misleading in marking off three levels of detail on the vertical axis, "identification," "description," and "analysis," with "analysis" at the top, because "analysis" is not a parallel concept and does not necessarily represent a greater elaboration of detail. In physical bibliography, analysis is a tool which plays a role in the production of a description; an analytical article may amount to a thorough physical description, or it may be only a partial description, less elaborate than a full-scale description, but in any case the fact that it is in essay form is beside the point. In reference bibliography, a book review—shown in their diagram as the counterpart of bibliographical analysis—is not the only form of content analysis; one-word assessments, such as "important," "disappointing," and "basic," are often attached to the entries in a reference list and are examples of analysis, but they do not make those entries more elaborate than a standard library catalogue entry. Part of the problem, at least on the physical side, comes perhaps from the fact that the Cameron-McMullin-Sood diagram is not concerned with distinguishing between catalogues and bibliographies: it is possible for a physical description based on one copy to result from very little analysis (though some judgment is always involved), but a description of an ideal copy based on many actual copies inevitably results from analysis. Nevertheless, the accompanying discussion, "Principles of Short-Title Cataloguing" (pp. 1-19), offers a thoughtful consideration of certain basic issues, recognizing, for instance, that "bibliographical description pays some attention to the intellectual contents of a book, and descriptive cataloguing [i.e., reference bibliography] often pays attention to some aspects of the physical book" (p. 5). But it is not part of the purpose of the discussion to question the rationale behind present conventions of library cataloguing: "Adequate description of a book from the subject point of view is embodied in library cataloguing" (p. 4). 21 Du Rietz makes a similar point: "What is important . . . is that information science must not be allowed to impose its descriptive standards (or rather, lack of such standards) upon the science of bibliography, or upon current and retrospective national bibliography" (p. 25). Because he believes it to be "quite unreasonable to demand" that information science should deal with books "in a scholarly way and with any pretensions to accuracy," one can understand why he places reference bibliography within the domain of physical bibliography. "The only result," he says, "of separating 'reference' and 'physical' bibliography from each other is that enumerative bibliography will continue to drift away from the only influences that could possibly save its scholarly standards in the long run, namely, the influences of 'physical' bibliography" (p. 22). But this approach only shifts the original problem from "reference bibliography" to "information science"—for one is still left with a field (though it has a different name) in which the overriding concern for works results in an unsatisfactory treatment of books . One can readily applaud Du Rietz's efforts to raise the standards of enumerative bibliography; but incorporating it into physical bibliography leaves one with the question of why inadequate references to books should be tolerated in "information science." Since an interest in works must entail some reference to the books in which they are found, information science (under whatever name) cannot be irresponsible in such references. Du Rietz is right, of course, to point out that essentially physical details form the link between information science and the recording of books; therefore—as both he and I are suggesting in somewhat different ways—those details, when they appear in a context stressing works , should be treated in a manner compatible with (but not necessarily identical with) the way they would be treated in a context stressing books . 22 Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), the culmination of the tradition of descriptive bibliography, does build on the work of several earlier scholars (see note 62 below); but the total number of methodological discussions in this field is relatively small, and the codifications are the products of individual scholars (not of committees and public conferences). 23 Paul S. Dunkin has provided several useful historical surveys of this tradition, emphasizing the quarter-century preceding AACR (1967): "Criticisms of Current Cataloging Practice," Library Quarterly , 26 (1956), 286-302; "Cataloging and CCS [Cataloging and Classification Section of American Library Association]: 1957-1966," Library Resources and Technical Services , 11 (1967), 267-288; Cataloging U.S.A.

All three volumes, particularly the first (pp. 3-19) and third (pp. 1-5), contain some introductory historical material; and the checklists in the second (pp. 161-165) and third (pp. 92-95) provide good coverage of the most important publications of the period 1953-69. See also "The New Rules in Action: A Symposium," ed. C. Donald Cook, Library Resources and Technical Services , 13 (1969), 7-41; and Cataloguing Standards : The Report of the Canadian Task Group on Cataloguing Standards (1972). 26 Changes are also recorded in two series of bulletins: Cataloging Rules : Additions and Changes (for the North American Text) and Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules Amendment Bulletin (for the British Text). The occasion for the publication of a revised North American text of Chapter 6 was the necessity for incorporating into it the newly developed rules for International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), although other changes were made in Chapter 6 at the same time. The purpose of ISBD is to provide standard punctuation in entries (such as an oblique line between the title and the author's name, a colon between the place of publication and the publisher's name, or a period-dash between the title-author statement and the imprint), so that the various elements of an entry can be identified regardless of language and so that the entries are therefore machinereadable. For a good introduction, see C. Sumner Spalding, "ISBD: Its Origin, Rationale, and Implications," Library Journal , 98 (1973), 121-123 (cf. 124-130, 394-395, and 495-496); and George M. Sinkankas, "International Cataloging and International Standard Bibliographic Description," in Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science , ed. Allen Kent et al. , 12 (1974), 278-320. The first edition of the ISBD rules (1971) has now been replaced by a "First Standard Edition": ISBD ( M ): International Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications (1974). Historical background is provided in Dorothy Anderson, "International Standardization of Cataloguing and Bibliographical Records: The Work of the IFLA Committee on Cataloguing," UNESCO Bulletin for Libraries , 27 (1973), 66-71, 107, and in "IFLA Committee on Cataloguing, 1954-1974," International Cataloguing , 3. no. 1 (Jan./March 1974), 5-8. 27 Quoted from the jacket of the British Text by R. O. Linden in the Nottingham Seminar (see note 25 above), p. 45. Gorman has also said that "these rules are undoubtedly correct in their general and in their basic conclusions" (p. 32) in his review in Library Association Record , 70 (1968), 27-32. 28 Except where otherwise indicated, the text cited and quoted here is the 1974 pamphlet version of the North American Text of Chapter 6 (redrafted by Paul W. Winkler). Certain differences between that version and the North American or British texts of 1967 will be commented on in footnotes; but I have made no attempt systematically to cover all the differences, which have been taken up by D. Whitney Coe in "A Cataloger's Guide to AACR Chapter 6, Separately Published Monographs, 1974," Library Resources and Technical Services , 19 (1975), 101-120. A number of discussions of the differences between the 1967 North American and British texts have been published; for Chapter 6 of AACR , see in particular R. O. Linden's analysis in the Nottingham Seminar (see note 25 above), pp. 45-54. 29 The 1967 British Text, in this respect, focuses more directly on content by requiring the last page of a section to be recorded (whether numbered or not) and by not requiring brackets for unnumbered pages: "a sequence consisting of the preface and list of contents on pages numbered i-ix, followed on the next recto by a list of tables extending over four unnumbered pages, is described in the collation as xiv p." (143B1c). 30 The 1967 British Text, again here, is more clearly concerned with content, for it does not make pagination in itself a sign of the importance of a section: it merely says that sequences, numbered or unnumbered, which consist of "inessential matter" are to be "disregarded" (143B1b). 31 The 1967 British Text does not need to say "approximately" because of its requirement of recording the unnumbered pages at the end of a sequence which are clearly a part of the sequence (143B1d; cf. note 29 above). 32 The 1967 North American Text had made the inclusion of the pagination for advertisements in such cases optional: "the pagination may be presented in the following form: 124 p. (p. 119-124 advertisements) to alert the reader to the fact that this work might also be described as 118 p." (144A). 33 Both 1967 texts specify only that "one or more" main sections are to be separately recorded, with a bracketed total for the remaining lesser ones (North American, 142A3; British, 143B3). This rule is somewhat more logical than the 1974 version because it merely differentiates principal from less important sections, rather than setting an arbitrary number of principal sections as the dividing line between two kinds of treatment. 34 The tradition of giving pagination only for books of one volume goes back at least as far as Charles C. Jewett's Smithsonian Report on the Construction of Catalogues of Libraries (1852, 1853). 35 The 1967 British Text handles this point more satisfactorily by simply saying that "separately paged sections of preliminary matter after the first volume may be ignored if not important" (143C3). If they are important, recording them poses no problem because the British Text allows for the recording of separate pagination for each volume ("the pagination of each volume may be given in parentheses after the number of volumes"), offering as an example "2 v. (xxxix, 429 p.; [4], 501 p.)" (143C2). 36 There is further confusion here in the distinction between "bibliographical volumes" and "physical volumes" (141C1). "Bibliographical volumes" are apparently to be regarded as parts or divisions of a work, and they may or may not coincide with the physical volumes in which the sheets containing the work are bound. Thus the rule says to state the "bibliographical volumes" first, as "8 v. in 5"; but actually the physical element is basic in both numbers. A set originally containing eight physical volumes may later be rebound into five volumes, and this sort of notation may be helpful for identification; but if the division into eight means only that the work has eight sections or divisions, there would be no more reason to specify the number of "volumes" than to name the number of chapters. To put the point another way: a single volume may contain a work in which the text is divided into three "Volumes" or "Books"; it may also contain sheets which were printed in such a way as to indicate that they were intended to be bound in three physical volumes. While "3 v. in 1" might be an appropriate way of referring to the latter, it would seem pointless for the former; and this distinction is not conveyed by the concept of "bibliographical volume" in rule 141C1. 37 The same problem is presented by one of the statements in the "Principles of Descriptive Cataloging" at the beginning of Part II of the North American AACR : "An attempt is made to describe a physically complete copy" (p. 189). Such a statement is beside the point if the copy being catalogued happens not to be complete. The British Text at least recognizes this problem and attaches a second sentence: "When possible the description should be that of a perfect copy. Imperfections in a particular copy are indicated" (p. 159). 38 Still other pagination rules raise troublesome questions. The rules for treating folded leaves, double leaves, duplicate paging, and two-way paging (141B4, 5, 6, 8) require the mention of these features, as if certain physical details are of particular interest in their own right. Actually, the first two—folded and double leaves—have a bearing on an indication of the extent of the work, since ten folded leaves can be expected to contain more material than ten ordinary leaves, and ten double leaves will contain only half the material that could ordinarily be printed on the same amount of paper (twenty single leaves). But when the foliation or pagination (printed or inferred) in effect converts such leaves to regular units—as when eighteen double leaves are referred to as "[36] p. (on double leaves)"—the specification of the nature of the leaves is superfluous, except as a physical detail. But in a catalogue entry stressing the work, not the book, what is the rationale for requiring this detail in preference to others in those cases where it does not contribute to an understanding of the extent of the work? The other two features—duplicate and two-way paging—are only special cases of the larger problem of separately numbered sequences. It may be, as with other sequences, that it is easier to list the figures separately than to add them together; but the rules do not suggest that the practice is merely one of expediency, not necessitated by the purposes which the entries are intended to serve. 39 This point is further indicated by the fact that rule 141B1d says, "More than one illustration on a leaf, even if numbered by the printer, does not affect the numeration of the plates as such"—whereas it would obviously affect the numeration of the illustrations. No rule corresponding to 141B1d is present in the 1967 North American Text; the inclusion of this rule in 1974 is an improvement, bringing the North American Text closer to the British, where the distinction between plates and illustrations had been clearer from the beginning. The 1967 British Text defines "plate" as "a page containing illustrative matter" but not forming part of "either the preliminary or main sequence of pages" (143B1b); and it provides for recording the number of plates as part of the pagination statement (143B1b,c, 143B4, 143D1c). The illustration statement is therefore clearly concerned only with the nature of the illustrations, regardless of what pages they appear on, and it is "independent of the statement of pagination" (143D1a). 40 This unsatisfactory note, repeated verbatim from the 1967 North American Text and the 1949 LC Rules , does not appear in the British Text at all. 41 Books may of course be shelved according to their size, but their call numbers or shelf marks—not their dimensions—would serve to locate them. 42 The practice, which has been followed in certain catalogues, of using format designation (like "40" and "80") vaguely to suggest shape is even less defensible than the AACR requirement because it misuses a notation with a long-established meaning in physical bibliography and thereby increases the possibilities for confusion. The Prussian Instructions (trans. Andrew Osborn, 1938) are guilty in this respect, for they recommend that "40," for instance, be used to refer to a height of 25-35 cm. (p. 13). An example of the difficulties which such usage can cause is illustrated by John R. Hetherington in "Signatures and Sizes," TLS , 14 October 1965, p. 928; he summarizes his experiences in one project by saying, "Thus in a field restricted to two titles, books reported to me as sixteenth and seventeenth-century quartos have included folios, octavos, 12mos, and 16mos." A fourth element sometimes required in the collation is taken up in rule 141F: the mention of "accompanying materials," such as a teacher's manual or materials placed in a pocket inside the cover of a book. The logic of attaching this information to the height is not clear, nor is the reason for regarding some items in pockets as illustrations (141D5) and others as "accompanying materials." 43 Another perplexing rule shows that even fidelity to the printed numbers is not an absolute requirement: in the preliminaries, a single numbered recto (but not verso) which does not match the actual count is to be disregarded (271). 44 The "5 l." means that "some or all of the leaves are blank on one side" (272); and the "2 l." at the end may mean two printed rectos (the number of leaves is given "instead of several groups of pages in brackets separated by commas") or else three or four printed pages which do not continue the main text (273). 45 For some reactions to the 1941 rules, see the four papers gathered under the title "Scholarly Libraries and the New Cataloging Rules," College and Research Libraries , 3 (1941-42), 117-138. 46 See, for instance, notes 29, 30, 31, 35, 37, 39, and 40 above. Seymour Lubetzky speaks of the "noxious compromises" in the North American Text, says that the British "could not bring themselves to go along with the more glaringly aberrant compromises," and urges a revision of the North American Text to "heal the fissure"; see "1976 Minus 6 . . . 5 . . . ," Library Journal , 96 (1971), 450-451. Although he is referring principally to the rules for entry and headings, the North American Text is inferior in the rules for description also. 47 Seymour Lubetzky, in Appendix E to the same booklet, criticizes "our elaborate collation statement in which we undertake to give an accounting of every page and detail, whereas its real function is only to give a physical characterization of the work" (p. 43). Henkle had earlier reported on the "Library of Congress Conferences on Cataloging, October 18 - November 19, 1943," in Catalogers' and Classifiers' Yearbook , 11 (1945), 68-84, where he says that "librarians have appeared to be excessively preoccupied with the problems of collation" (p. 73). 48 He explained, "That is to say it sets out to provide a description of a book which can be used as a standard of a perfect copy, by readers far removed from the library." See his The Principles of Cataloguing (1960), p. 133. 49 This concentration on rules for entry is also a reflection of the fact that the library cataloguer is primarily concerned with the contents of books. Lubetzky has called description "the simpler aspect of cataloging" and the rules for entry "the most critical and complex aspect" ( Principles of Cataloging , pp. iv, 18; see also his "Some Observations on the Revision of the Cataloging Code," Library Quarterly , 26 [1966], 362-366). Bakewell asserts, "The collation is certainly the most expendable part of the entry" ( A Manual of Cataloguing Practice , p. 4). 50 "Summary of Proceedings," in The Code and the Cataloguer (see note 25 above), pp. 91-101 (quotation from p. 94). Jack R. Nelson, in his review of the North American AACR , states, "It is this section of the new code, in fact, with which I am least happy. . . . it is very regrettable that in this problem area the new code is so disappointing" ( Australian Library Journal , 16 [1967], 119-123). 51 In his paper on Chapter 6 of AACR in Seminar on the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (see note 25 above), pp. 45-54 (quotation from p. 46). He elaborates on the confusion in this way: "pagination and the statement of the number of volumes is a bibliographic statement, the illustration statement is an evaluative statement, and finally size is a bibliographic statement, but different from pagination" (p. 46). But the first and last, as they are set up, are not really "bibliographic"; they are made to serve an "evaluative" function (to use these terms), so the confusion between the two exists within the individual elements of the collation line. Linden, in some of his other comments, seems to imply that physical description ought to be the goal. Thus he says that the listing of the total of unnumbered plates is "a good move in the direction of a true collation statement" (p. 50), whereas a recording of the number of illustrations would give "a false impression of physical makeup" (p. 51). Similarly he comments, "Size has always been something of a dubious item in cataloguing. Quite often it is not strictly a bibliographical statement at all" (p. 51). 52 Thus the reproduction of an error and its correction in brackets (133A2) is proper—and is not an example of an inappropriate concern for a physical detail— because the meaning of the quoted words is involved. 53 There has been much discussion of this point, resulting—in the 1974 version of Chapter 6—in an "alternative" rule 134D1 presented as a footnote. This new alternative rule says that the author statement may be omitted "unless the form of name in the heading is not recognizably the same as that in the book" or unless certain other conditions obtain—almost the same as the basic rule in the 1967 British Text (there labeled 134A). The 1967 North American Text was somewhat more strict in that the names had to be identical, not just "recognizably the same," before the author statement could be eliminated; but at least provision for eliminating the repetition was a part of the basic rule (134A). By relegating this kind of rule to a footnote and making it an alternative to a more rigid rule, the 1974 version has taken a step backward; the acceptance of the British model is sensible, but the resulting rule should have been incorporated into the main text. 54 In the 1941 proposed code, rule 226 required ellipsis dots to show the omission of words at the head of the title page; and if the omitted material were relevant, it was to be reported in a note, following the body of the entry, beginning with the words "At head of title." Even an author's name appearing at the head of the title in exactly the same form as the one used for the heading of the entry was to be repeated in such a note. This rule clearly shows an exaggerated attention to the form of the title page, since there is no intention of producing an exact transcription in any case. The North American Text of AACR still contains a provision for "At head of title" notes (145 in 1967, 144 in 1974); but the ellipsis dots are not required, and the note is only for relevant information "not transposed to another position in the catalog entry" and thus "not provided for by the general pattern of the catalog entry" (cf. the brief treatment in the 1967 British Text, 145C2). 55 An illustration of the way in which the imprint statement can be regarded from the point of view of reference, rather than physical, bibliography is provided by Henkle, who refers to the "premise that the principal value of the publisher statement is its contribution to the characterization of the quality, authenticity, or bias of the book" ( Studies of Descriptive Cataloging , p. 9). 56 Indeed, the basic rule for "Date" (139A) requires that precedence be given to the "year of publication of the first impression of the edition," even if the year of a later printing appears on the title page (the example given is "1970, t.p. 1973"). It is proper that entries in a library catalogue should indicate the date of the work (or text ); and the rule is in this respect an improvement over the corresponding rule (141A) in the 1967 North American Text, which emphasizes the imprint date and makes no provision for indicating the date of original publication of the edition (the revised rule comes closer to what the British Text recommended from the beginning in its 142A: "The date to be given is the date of the edition, which may be followed by the date of the imprint where the difference is important"). But the date of the impression which the library holds should also invariably be recorded—and not be regarded as an optional item when it does not appear on the title page, to be noted only "if it is important to identify a later impression as such, e.g. because it contains textual variations." (Cf. 135A: "Statements relating to the impression or printing are included only in the case of items having particular bibliographical importance or when the impression or printing has been corrected or otherwise revised.") In most cases one cannot know, without a great deal of work, just what differences may exist between two impressions; therefore, calling attention to the particular impression in a library catalogue entry is appropriate not merely because the business of any catalogue entry is to report on the copy at hand but also because the indication of the impression can always turn out to be important to those who are primarily concerned with the content of the book. For a criticism of the 1967 form of the rule in the North American Text and an argument that library cataloguers should be capable of recognizing a reprint even when not labeled and establishing the date of original publication of the edition, see Robert N. Broadus, "The Problem of Dates in Bibliographic Citations," College and Research Libraries , 29 (1968), 387-392. Ronald Hagler, speaking of the 1967 rule, comments, "I think that, as cataloguers, we continue to suffer from ambivalence about whether we really want to describe the dating of the material or the dating of the particular physical book which we have" ( New Rules for an Old Game [see note 25 above], p. 92). 57 The 1967 North American Text requires brackets around any information within the body of the entry which does not come from the title page (132A1); the alterations in 1974 are a move in the right direction but have not been made consistently. In the British Text, the requirement was never as rigid as that in the North American but does involve inconsistency: the edition statement, the imprint, and the series statement "may be taken from other places in the book without the use of square brackets," but information for the title and author statements may not (132A1). Clearly the title, in this respect, does fall in a different category from the other details, so long as the title is defined (for those books with title pages) as that form of the title which appears on the title page; but the reason for placing the author's name in the same category is not apparent. 58 Seymour Lubetzky said in 1946 that cataloguing "practice represents the result of an effort to preserve the integrity of the title-page and an inability to do so. . . . the aim of the cataloger should be not to point out the differences of the title-pages but the identity of the books under them" (in Appendix E of Henkle, Studies of Descriptive Cataloging , pp. 44-45). 59 In the 1949 Library of Congress Rules , the opening section on the "Definition of Descriptive Cataloging" points out that there is "some ambiguity in the use of the term," because the "determination of the form of the headings" is sometimes regarded as a separate activity from "the description of an item" (as in the 1941 preliminary second edition of the A.L.A. Catalog Rules ), whereas both are "commonly understood" to comprise "descriptive cataloging" (the whole being distinct from subject cataloguing). This ambiguity, involving the way the divisions of a single professional field are labeled, is in addition to the one I am talking about, which results from the use of the same term in two fields with differing aims. 60 Statements of this kind are made repeatedly in writings and textbooks on library cataloguing. Cf. Wyllis E. Wright, "Some Fundamental Principles in Cataloging," Catalogers' and Classifiers' Yearbook , 7 (1938), 26-39: "The collation attempts to give, in brief form, a physical description of the volume" (p. 36). 61 AACR provides a brief glossary (North American, pp. 343-347; British, pp. 266-269), but it does not contain such crucial terms as "edition," "impression," or "issue." For terms not listed, one is referred to the outdated A.L.A. Glossary of Library Terms , ed. Elizabeth H. Thompson (1943), where "edition," for instance, after being defined properly as all impressions from one setting of type, is said to be dependent on format as well. Under "impression," one reads, "If, however, the pages are reimposed to produce a different format, the resultant impression should be considered a different edition." And the confusion is further compounded under "edition": "A facsimile reproduction constitutes a different edition." A catalogue code which assents to such definitions is built on a weak foundation. By "bibliographical terminology" AACR also perhaps means the form for the recording of pagination and size; but to call the recommendations in those areas "standard" is to beg the question, since they do not conform with the practices of those whose principal field of interest is physical description. 62 In such works as A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg, "Some Points in Bibliographical Descriptions," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-8), 31-52; Pollard, "The Objects and Methods of Bibliographical Collations and Descriptions," Library , 2nd ser., 8 (1907), 193-217; R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), pp. 145-163; Greg, "A Formulary of Collation," Library , 4th ser., 14 (1933-34), 365-382; Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), and "Bibliography Revisited," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 89-128. 63 Roy Stokes, in his 1967 revision of Esdaile, abandons "the older tradition of descriptive work" characterized by "distinct stages such as Short description or Short standard description" and says, "The description should be as detailed as the purpose of the listing demands, and no longer" (p. 256). In proceeding to point out that an antiquarian bookseller would be likely to emphasize different facts from a bibliographer preparing a subject list, he touches on an important concept that could profitably have been elaborated. (Cutter's 1876 Rules represent the "older tradition" Stokes refers to, for Cutter sets up requirements for "Short, Medium, and Full" entries [p. 9]. Cf. also the work of Pollard mentioned in note 62 above, and the well-known article of Falconer Madan on "Degressive Bibliography," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 [1906-8], 53-65. Abandoning such precisely defined steps, however, as Stokes realizes, does not mean that the level of detail cannot be varied under differing circumstances.) 64 The integrative direction of his effort is suggested by this expression in his chapter on collation: "The bibliographer, who includes the cataloguing librarian" (p. 215). 65 Cowley goes too far in asserting that these different approaches "must not be mixed" and that they "cannot be combined in one piece of work" (p. 9). But perhaps his extreme position is the effect of a salutary reaction against the much more common error of mixing them indiscriminately and carelessly—without, indeed, realizing that any mixing is taking place. 66 Except for repetition of the initial distinction: on p. 59 the reader is again told that "the prospective user" of "an ordinary book" wants to know "only what it is about and how much there is of it for him to read," so collation of pagination is sufficient; but a rare book is "valuable chiefly, if not only, as a physical entity," and therefore "the description of a rare book must make the book's physical structure perfectly clear." 67 The paragraph which contains this statement and concludes with the sentence I quote next was dropped in his 1973 revision, apparently because the point was largely covered in his new preface; in any case, his later writing shows that his deletion does not mean that he had changed his mind. 68 Dunkin had earlier expressed the view that cataloguers do not interpret evidence (and voiced his dissatisfaction with Bowers's definitions of "issue" and "state") in "The State of the Issue," PBSA , 42 (1948), 239-255. I have commented on his argument in "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 54, n. 41. The 1973 revision of his booklet includes a new section (called "Distinctions: Cataloger and Bibliographer," pp. 14-15) summarizing his position regarding "issue" and "state." (On cataloguers as analysts, see also note 92 below.) 69 And in his checklist, Bowers's Principles is described as an "elaborate and arbitrary codification" (p. 7). In an earlier treatment of some of the same material, "On the Catalog Card for a Rare Book," Library Quarterly , 16 (1946), 50-56, he praises the collation formula of Greg and McKerrow (adding that a catalogue card should use words instead). 70 It is difficult to see, for instance, why Dunkin's "[A] 2 A-Y 4 " is simpler than Bowers's "π 2 A-Y 4 "; but it is clear that Bowers's form gives rise to less ambiguity. 71 The other major addition to the revised edition is a simplified method of title-page transcription, which he calls "calculated-risk transcription," resembling the quotation of titles in routine library cataloguing (pp. 36-40). If this method sometimes fails to identify "an edition or issue," the risk is worth taking because "it is not unlikely that the scholar wanting to use the book would insist on making his own judgment about its edition and issue anyhow." This line of argument, of course, could lead to doing nothing; the real question is not whether a user will uncritically accept the information but whether that information is relevant to the purposes of the entry and also falls within the level of detail established for it. 72 ACRL Monograph No. 27, ed. H. Richard Archer, pp. 65-73. Alden had earlier written the introduction to the 1946-47 Rosenbach Lectures, Standards of Bibliographical Description (1949), pointing out the revolutionary impact of McKerrow's Introduction and the need for agreement on "acceptable minimum standards" for bibliographical description. Although the volume is not primarily concerned with library cataloguing, Lawrence C. Wroth's essay on "Early Americana" does set forth "an intermediate form of entry" (p. 104) more appropriate for a library catalogue than a "full-dress bibliography"; his position is that considerations of time and money demand "brevity and simplicity" in a library catalogue. He is of course principally speaking about degrees of detail in the recording of physical data, but he believes that a full-scale description should also give proportionate attention to the text and its history (p. 106). 73 Or as he puts it in another place, speaking as a rare-book cataloguer: "we can, in the course of describing what we possess in a significant fashion, provide signposts and achieve a high bibliographical standard" (p. 69). 74 Similarly, Andrew Osborn writes, "At its best that process [rare-book cataloguing] is a skilful blending of the general techniques of cataloguing and the insights of critical bibliography. Rare-book cataloguing is thus a borderline discipline; if at any time the cataloguing or the bibliographical insights and skills are absent or weak, the results are bound to leave a great deal to be desired." See pp. 126-127 of "Relation between Cataloguing Principles and Principles Applicable to Other Forms of Bibliographical Work," in the Report (1963) of the 1961 Paris Conference, pp. 125-137. 75 A "revised and corrected" printing appeared in 1972, but the passages quoted below were not affected; however, some of the citations of pages would be slightly different if keyed to the 1972 impression (the references to pp. 41-42, 19-20, 18-19, 46, and 45-46 would become, respectively, 42, 20, 19, 47, and 46). 76 He makes similar criticisms of the size and pagination rules in "Some Thoughts on the Card Catalogue Description of Incunables," Serif , 10, no. 2 (Summer 1973), 10-18. On the LC page collation: "I still think of it in the old New England phrase—neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring. Even its main attraction, brevity, is not always apparent; and when brevity is brought in by the neck, it is often at such a gross expenditure of accuracy that the line might better be left empty" (p. 13). 77 Further comment on the need for more bibliographical training in library schools can be found in Fredson Bowers, Bibliography and Modern Librarianship (1966), reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 75-93. For related comments, see Randolph G. Adams, "Librarians as Enemies of Books," Library Quarterly , 7 (1937), 317-331; Frederick B. Adams, Jr., "Long Live the Bibliophile!", College and Research Libraries , 16 (1955), 344-346; Cecil K. Byrd, "Rare Books in University Libraries," Library Trends , 5 (1956-57), 441-450; Rollo G. Silver, "The Training of Rare Book Librarians," Library Trends , 9 (1960-61), 446-452; Gordon N. Ray, "The Changing World of Rare Books," PBSA , 59 (1965), esp. 117-124; and David C. Weber, "Bibliographical Blessings," PBSA , 61 (1967), 307-314. Roy Stokes is thinking more of deficiencies in bibliographical training than in the cataloguing codes when he says, "In view of the number of years during which we have had cataloging codes, or have been working towards new ones, it is disheartening to think that there are comparatively few libraries which have catalogs of which they might justly be proud"; and he suggests that in certain areas "an acute understanding of bibliography and its problems is essential if anything worth-while is to be accomplished" (p. 585 of "The Teaching of Bibliography," Library Trends , 7 [1958-59], 582-591). 77a More recently Roderick Cave, in his book on Rare Book Librarianship (1976), has included a chapter on "Processing, Cataloguing and Classification" (pp. 67-82), but it does not contain any detailed consideration of the relationship between standard and rare-book cataloguing. Recognizing that the rare-book department is concerned "with the book as artifact and not just as vehicle for the text" (p. 68), Cave generalizes that "the librarian charged with the responsibility of developing catalogues of a special collection needs to approach his material more in the manner of a bibliographer than of the librarian applying the standard techniques and codes of his profession" (pp. 70-71). It is not the purpose of his discussion, however, to examine what this difference of approach consists of or to question the practices of standard cataloguing. He finds "routine cataloguing" appropriate as the basic cataloguing for a rare-book collection, to be supplemented by special catalogues of definable units within it. These catalogues may sometimes require detailed attention to physical features, but, he says, "The rigour of descriptive bibliography will naturally be the exception and employed normally only in those libraries pre-eminent in a particular field and in which the catalogue descriptions serve as a substitute for a formal bibliography" (p. 72). His comments seem designed as an introductory survey of presently accepted practices, not as an inquiry into the rationale for those practices. Yet his chapter does convey, however indirectly, a sense of the awkwardness of the split between "routine cataloguing" and the "rigour of descriptive bibliography." 78 It is interesting that Cutter's rules of 1876 refer to a wider range of rare books than incunabula (p. 80), whereas the 1941 and 1949 codes and AACR have a section specifically restricted to incunabula. 79 Quotations and examples from Gallup are taken from A Bibliography of Ezra Pound (1963), pp. 9-10; but the same discussion can be found in T. S. Eliot : A Bibliography (rev. 1969), pp. 11-12. 80 Of course, the specification of which entire leaves are blank—as in "1 blank leaf, 3 leaves, 9-29 pp."—also shows a concern with content, a concern not carried on into the "3 leaves." 81 The parenthetical abbreviations are supplying some of the information which would be presented in a contents paragraph in a physical description: "reference bibliography, which usually need not give collational lists of contents in the entries, has to add some brief information about the existence of blank leaves and advertisement leaves at the beginning and end of each pagination sequence" (p. xlii). 82 "A page formula," he says, "can never be analytical, and need not be so, but nevertheless has to be based upon some kind of analytical investigation, in order to make it quantitatively equal to a real analytical formula" (p. xliv). 83 At one point he says, more emphatically, that "the collational systems hitherto employed in reference bibliography and library cataloguing do not really serve the purposes they have been supposed to serve," and he doubts whether in some cases "there has been any real awareness of purposes at all" (p. xli). 84 On this point, he says, "It is a truism, that as long as reference bibliographers remain bibliographically ignorant, their bibliographies and catalogues will be bibliographically worthless, and their collations and classifications useless and unreliable" (pp. xl-xli). He also discusses this matter in PBSA , 64 (1970), 242-250. 85 Another recent proposal, not concerned directly with pagination, is relevant here as further illustrating the attempt to work out a scheme for concisely including more physical information in a brief catalogue entry. J. W. Jolliffe, in Computers and Early Books : Report of the LOC Project (1974), describes a method for "fingerprinting" books, devised in connection with Project LOC, a project for "investigating means of compiling a machine-read-able union catalogue of pre-1801 books in Oxford, Cambridge and the British Museum" (to quote the title page of the report). The "fingerprint" consists of the characters which appear at specified positions on several specified pages in a given book (according to the standard proposed on pp. 95-99, it would contain sixteen symbols, being the last two or first two characters—for rectos and versos respectively—in each of the last two lines on four precisely specified pages). It is intended as an identifier (easily constructed by a person without bibliographical training) which would be useful in computer sorting, but its supporters see a broader usefulness for it: "it seems clear that the fingerprint may also be of use, in descriptive cataloguing and other library activities in which it will be established by fully trained professional librarians" (p. 95), and "it is to be hoped that it or something like it will become a part of regular descriptive bibliography" (p. 8). Whether such an identifier offers a practical approach for linking entries in library catalogues and in bibliographies is doubtful. One immediately apparent limitation, admitted by its supporters, is that it cannot by itself distinguish among impressions from a single setting of type or line-for-line resettings. Jolliffe has made further comments on Project LOC and on an eighteenth-century STC in his contribution to Eighteenth-Century English Books Considered by Librarians and Booksellers, Bibliographers and Collectors (1976). For some criticisms of the "fingerprint" system, see Donald D. Eddy's comments in that volume. Another approach to computerized short-title cataloguing, the HPB Project, is described by its director, William J. Cameron, in the same volume (cf. note 20 above). 86 Inferred page numbers may be more conveniently printed in italics than enclosed in brackets. But I have used brackets here, since they are a more widely recognized convention. 87 It would actually appear to be unnecessary in this statement to specify which numbers are inferred, since the pagination formula provides a full record of that information. 88 Whether there were two or three blank pages in the group 285-288—that is, whether there were two pages, or only one page, of advertisements—the notation would remain "2 LLBA," and it would not in any case indicate which of the two leaves contained advertising. 89 One possible exception is the abbreviated version of this descriptive formula which Bowers makes a part of his formulary (p. 462). The system is the same as for the full formula, except that unnumbered pages within a sequence are not noted. Thus the short form for the book postulated earlier would be as follows: pp. [i-v] vi-xvii [xviii-xx], [1] 2-283 [284-288]. Without an accompanying contents note, of course, this form is not entirely unambiguous as a physical record. 90 It must be remembered that citations in footnotes and in lists at the ends of articles, chapters, and books constitute one of the commonest types of reference bibliography, and any realistic proposal about the form which reference entries should take must involve an awareness of what can reasonably be expected in such cases. Of course, reference bibliography can operate on different levels of detail, and a library catalogue entry may sometimes be more, and sometimes less, detailed than an entry in a checklist; but the realities of the various situations in which reference bibliography is employed must be recognized in any attempt to develop a workable approach to the whole field. 91 One could argue that the division into roman and arabic figures is a physical detail which need not be perpetuated in a reference entry; on the other hand, one could say that it reveals more accurately the extent of the main body of the work. 92 The amount of judgment involved in putting down a number other than the last printed one would surely take no more time and be subject to no more errors than is the case in following the present rules. Sometimes the recording of the last printed page numbers has been justified on the grounds that it does not involve the cataloguer's judgment; but, as Henkle points out in his 1945 article (see note 47 above), "It would hardly seem to follow that a principle of book description which requires the least exercise of judgment on the part of catalogers necessarily results in the most intelligible entries" (p. 81). Margaret Mann gives the first chapter of her Introduction to Cataloging and the Classification of Books (2nd ed., 1943) the title "The Cataloger as an Interpreter of Books." 93 A library cataloguer obviously is restricted in the amount of time that can be spent on an entry; but abbreviating the examination of a book and shortening the resulting entry are not synonymous with abandoning careful distinctions or lowering standards of definition. Paul S. Dunkin has repeatedly argued that, because many more books are recorded in catalogues than in descriptive bibliographies, cross-reference between entries for a given book would be facilitated if the definitions employed were "based on easily recognized physical differences" (that is, rather than on an analytical approach). See the practically identical wording in How to Catalog a Rare Book (rev. 1973), p. 15, and Bibliography: Tiger or Fat Cat? , p. 15; see also my comment in PBSA , 69 (1975), 54, n. 41. Of course, the fact that reference bibliographers outnumber descriptive bibliographers in defining a term like "edition" in a given way does not alter the fact that the subject is one in which the descriptive bibliographer is the specialist. 94 Dunkin in particular has emphasized these points: see, for instance, "The State of the Issue" (see note 68 above), pp. 252-255; and Bibliography: Tiger or Fat Cat? , pp. 29-33, ending with the statement, "He [the cataloguer] serves everyman; therefore he must use the tongue of everyman." Cf. Foxon, Thoughts (see note 3 above), pp. 22-23. 95 Tradition and Principle in Library Cataloguing (1966). On tradition in cataloguing, see also Pierce Butler, "The Bibliographical Function of the Library," Journal of Cataloging and Classification , 9 (1953), 3-11. Ann F. Painter says, in Reader in Classification and Descriptive Cataloging (1972), "Probably more than with classification, descriptive cataloging suffers from the secure attitude of 'we've always done it this way and it works'" (p. 155). 96 Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalogue (1876), p. 75.

      <field name="heading_text">A Qualitative Analysis of Compositors C and D in the Shakespeare First Folio by John S. O'Connor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The promise that compositorial analysis has held out for editors of Shakespeare—that it could significantly affect how editors treat accidentals, lineation, and emendations, as well as indirectly reveal the nature of the printer's copy—has not yet been fulfilled because of the incompleteness of our knowledge about the compositors of the Shakespeare First Folio. Compositorial analysis of the First Folio has been primarily concerned with establishing the number of compositors and identifying their shares of the text. 1 These tasks have been the necessary prerequisite for analysis of the amount and kind of textual corruption that the compositors introduced. Now that recent studies of the Comedies section of the Folio have revealed "who set what," 2 we can begin to examine the quality of each compositor's work, in that section at least. The Comedies section is especially important since the most authoritative text for ten of the fourteen plays in this section is the Folio, and five of the six compositors who worked on the Folio set pages in the Comedies. Compositor B was the most important compositor, setting 127 of the 301 pages. Dr. Alice Walker roughly described his habits over twenty years ago, 3 but a thorough analysis should wait until his share in the rest of the Folio is determined. Compositor F was the least important compositor, setting only 22 pages in the first five plays, and dropping out completely after MM. Compositor A began his work in the Folio with WT , and continued through the Histories and Tragedies. Compositor C and D may have worked only in the Comedies, with Compositor C setting 96 pages and Compositor D 41 pages. Although Compositors C and D are not so important as Compositor B, I have chosen to focus on them because we know nothing about the quality of their work; moreover, methods and generalizations developed while working on these more manageable compositors can then be adapted to the others. Also, by working with these two compositors, I can contrast their very different styles and offer a meaningful comparative analysis. For instance, the fact that Compositor D transposes words once in 25 pages becomes more significant when compared with the fact that Compositor C transposes words once every two pages. I have limited this study to substantive changes because this is the most significant compositorial evidence for editors. Both Compositors C and D set a number of pages in the four comedies where extant quartos were their copy ( Ado , LLL , MND , and MV ) as well as pages from Err , MM , AYL , Shr , and AWW . Compositor C also worked in Tmp , TGV , and Wiv. Thus, one can establish qualitative evidence (a list of changes the compositors made from the extant copy which reveals their habits), and apply it to the plays where the Folio is the only or best text. Compositor C was the more careless, in most ways, of the two compositors. In the four plays where his copy is extant, he set 267 corrupt substantives, 4 an average of one in every 21 lines; whereas Compositor D set 93 corrupt substantives, an average of one in every 34 lines (or in other words, Compositor C made one more error per column than Compositor D). These figures suggest that one should examine Compositor C's pages with more care and adopt emendations more readily, but it does not tell an editor what to look for. A mass figure or an average, like the ones above, can be misleading. Hence I have classified the substantive errors according to the traditional categories of substitutions, omissions, interpolations, and transpositions. COMPOSITOR C COMPOSITOR D Ado LLL MND MV Total Ado LLL MND MV total pages 13.5 11 9 8.5 5 6 5 9.5 Transpositions 4 4 3 8 19 0 0 0 1 1 Substitutions 55 58 31 30 174 10 19 15 26 70 Omissions 30 12 6 10 58 1 8 1 3 13 Interpolations 7 3 4 2 16 4 2 0 3 9 total 96 77 44 50 267 15 29 16 33 93 These categories allow us to spot some of the specific habits of each compositor, and thus to perceive more clearly their basic differences in method. TRANSPOSITIONS generally involve two monosyllabic words, and they usually do not change the meaning of a passage because the word order of English is often loose. The transpositions by Compositors C and D are typical: they do not radically alter the meaning, nor do they disrupt the meter in a verse line. Usually transpositions are the result of a memorial error. The compositor who frequently transposes words is probably trying to carry too much copy in his head. The frequency of transpositions in these four comedies reveals most dramatically how Compositors C and D differed in their type-setting techniques. Compositor D transposed words only once in 25-½ pages: shall it for it shall (P1, 803). Compositor C transposed words nineteen times in forty-two pages. TRANSPOSITIONS BY COMPOSITOR C Quarto Folio Ado I4 302 you do doe you 16 v 968 of us us of 986 * make but but make K3 v 1747 are you you are LLL L3 476 * was Sampson Sampson was L4 665 I will would I 674 shall we we shall M3 v 2108 * but vouchsafe vouchsafe but MND N3 v 700 we can can you N5 v 1170 all are are all O1 v 1736 * patcht a a patch'd MV O4 v 219 * is it it is P1 v 946 are you you are P6 v 2223 take then then take 2261 so taken taken so Q1 2318 * shalt thou thou shalt 2321 home with me with me home Q1 v 2477 it in in it Q2 v 2699 even but but ev'n Almost all of Compositor C's changes make sense. Most of his transpositions involved a verb: nine of them are between a modal verb and a pronoun, and four more are about the placement of the adverb before or after the verb. Thirteen of his transpositions are in verse lines but, despite the possible change of emphasis in the line of verse, his transpositions are nearly impossible to detect without referring to his copy. A few of his transpositions are obviously errors, as on O4 v , 219, and P6 v , 2223. Apparently Compositor C would read a line and then set it from memory, thereby occasionally changing the word order while retaining the sense of the line. Compositor D, on the other hand, kept checking his copy and rarely misread the word order. Possibly some of Compositor C's transpositions were not accidental; rather, they may have been conscious attempts to make the line clearer. Some of his changes are smoother than the quarto reading; for example, the change on 16 v makes the line smoother and clearer: "I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of " (968). Similarly on K3 v the Folio version, "Why then you are no maiden" (1747), is more direct. Still, making a line more regular might also be the result of memorial error—the compositor recalls a simpler phrasing. Some of Compositor C's transpositions may have been intentional, but I think they were simple memorial errors. As we will see, Compositor C was clearly prone to similar kinds of memorial errors. SUBSTITUTIONS are the exchange of one or more letters or words. Approximately 20% of the substitutions by Compositors C and D are corrections of obviously corrupt readings in their copy. The rest are corruptions that they introduce. Unintentional substitutions are of two types: the first type is orthographic—the omission or deletion of a single letter or the transposition of two letters (literals), or the confusion of common roots like willingly and willfully . The second type changes the whole word, like can for should , often roughly synonymous with the original. In general the first type results from misreading the copy; whereas the second seems to be memorial. (See the chart in Appendix I.) As with transpositions, Compositor C's substitutions are more frequent and seem to be more often memorial than Compositor D's substitutions, which seem to be more often misreadings of the copy. Compositor C averages a substitution every 32 lines; Compositor D substitutes on an average of once every 48 lines. Occasionally both compositors will substitute a number of words within a few lines (for example, Compositor C on L4 and Compositor D on N5), but generally they do not substitute words in clusters that might suggest illegible copy or compositorial fatigue. Compositor C makes five or more errors of substitution on eighteen of his forty-two pages, while Compositor D makes five or more errors of substitution on only five of his 25-½ pages. The difference does not appear to be patterned (due to the nature of the copy or position in the quire, for instance); rather Compositor C seems to be more erratic. Because of the low number of substitutions, it is difficult to see from the above lists if either compositor is prone to particular kinds of errors. The following chart divides their substitutions into some non-exclusive categories. Compositor C Compositor D number of substitutions 174 68+2 5 literals 89 38 same root 29 14 final s omitted or added 10 14 contraction, elision, or expansion 20 0 nouns and verbs 76 36 proper nouns 11 1 in prose 59 29 There are, of course, other possible categories, but these reveal some of the striking features of Compositor C's and D's substitutions. Over three-fourths of Compositor D's changes are of the orthographical sort. He had a particular fondness for omitting or adding a final s ; nearly 20% of all his substitutions involve a final s . Compositor D consistently misread the word in his copy and composed a word that looks similar but means something different. Line 1415 in MND is a good example: "Whiles I in this affair do thee imply" (Q: apply); or line 509 in MV : "I like not faire teames, and a villaines mind" (Q: terms). This kind of error is easier to spot than are memorial slips and, when we know that Compositor D habitually makes such errors, easier to emend. Compositor C, on the other hand, is more likely to make substitutions due to memorial error. Proportionately he does not have so many orthographical errors or misreadings as Compositor D; instead he more often forgets the exact wording or spelling. For instance, he occasionally does not recall if a word (especially a name) has been contracted or not; thus he makes such substitutions as upon for on (I4 v , 444) and ' Fore for Before (L1, 1012). He also makes another kind of memorial error when he sets a word that he has recently used in a similar context. Compositor C is occasionally influenced by nearby words or phrases; an apparent example of either eye-skip or memorial error is immaculate for maculate (L3, 396), since immaculate appears in line 395 directly above Compositor C's error. A second example of this kind of slip is the mixing of pronouns on M3 v ( you for her , 2083, and you for we , 2122), where Boyet is acting as a go-between for the two sets of lovers. Compositor C cannot match Boyet's ability to change the pronoun as he repeats the speech. 6 As one might expect of memorial slips, Compositor C changes the less significant connectives and qualifiers more often than the nouns and verbs. Some of his changes appear to be deliberate. Many of the changes are roughly synonymous, as looke for see (K3, 546) and doe for use (N3, 589). These changes might be due to spacing or attempts to improve the copy, rather than memorial errors. About a dozen of his substitutions seem to be in response to spacing difficulties. 7 A good example is on crowded I4, where he changes at least to yet : Another example of substitutions as a result of crowding can be found in lines 349 and 358 at the bottom of L2 v . Sometimes Compositor C apparently tries to improve his copy beyond correcting the obvious corruptions. He straightens out proper names in the speech-prefixes (K1, 1256) and in the text (O2, 1957). He 'corrects' at least one malapropism by Dogberry (K3, 1650). Also, he seems more sensitive to meter than Compositor D; he drops (L4, 669) or adds (N2, 253) syllables to regularize iambic pentameter lines. 8 The only comparable sophistication by Compositor D is dombe for dead (K6 v , 2531) for the sake of rhyme. Because Compositor C's substitutions are most often either memorial slips or conscious sophistications which preserve the original meaning, they are harder to detect than Compositor D's. Also, Compositor C's copy is harder to reconstruct since he often fails to leave any orthographical clues. OMISSIONS by both compositors generally seem to be either unconscious errors or attempts to save space, rather than deliberate improvements. As one might expect, Compositor C omits words more frequently than Compositor D. He also is significantly more careless on some of his pages than others; over half of his omissions occur on eight of his forty-two pages. (See chart in Appendix II.) Somewhat surprisingly, omissions occur more frequently in verse than in prose. Usually both compositors are sensitive to meter (though Compositor C has the better ear), and one would expect omissions to consist of extra, less important parts of speech, in prose passages. Both compositors usually omit a single word, often a pronoun or preposition. But only 15% of Compositor D's omissions fall into these two categories, compared with 40% for Compositor C. Once again this discrepancy can be explained according to their differing compositorial styles: memorial errors are likely to involve the less important parts of speech. Thus, Compositor D's omissions are often more significant than Compositor C's: for instance, he is slightly more prone to skip a line than Compositor C. Compositor D misses one or more lines three times in his 25-½ pages. Compositor C misses a line or more six times in his 42 pages, but two of them were probably editorial rather than compositorial. His two-line skip on K1 v may be due to a reference to the Spanish, "and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet"; 9 and the three-line slip on K4 v may be due to the four references to God in one line, "they serve God: and write God first, for God defend but God should goe before such villaines." A minor cause of omitting a line is eye-skip. On two occasions Compositor C omits lines because of eye-skip. I4 in the Folio is a classic example: The second instance is on K3 v , where 'do' is repeated at the end of four clauses in a row. Another minor cause for skipping a line is lack of space. Compositor C clearly skips a line because of lack of space on L1, the last page of Ado . Compositor D might have skipped a line on N6 v because of lack of space, since the whole page is crowded (see line 1378). Yet curiously a space is left where line 1348+1 should be. Lack of space is more frequently a cause for omitting a word, rather than a line. Some omissions in verse lines are clearly due to space problems. On L1, where Compositor C omitted a whole line because of lack of space, he also cut words in lines 2639, 2640, and 2641, rather than have each verse extend onto a second line. Similarly, Compositor D dropped a word on L4 v , where he also had omitted whole lines. If he had included 'maister' in line 779, he would have had to use two lines rather than one. Omissions due to spacing problems are few, however; most omissions by both compositors are simply careless errors. INTERPOLATIONS may be Compositor C's and D's least interesting changes. In most instances they do not add anything significant; rather, they simply make the meaning more explicit by adding an article, preposition, or pronoun. Over a third of Compositor C's interpolations are articles. (See chart in Appendix III.) In contrast to the other kinds of errors, interpolations occur with equal frequency in both compositors' pages. Possibly a compositor prone to memorial errors, like Compositor C, is less likely to interpolate than to substitute or omit. One significant difference in their interpolations is that Compositor D adds words in prose proportionately more often than Compositor C. This difference is probably due to Compositor C's greater sensitivity to meter: only four of Compositor C's additions are in verse lines (M1 v , N3, P4, and P5 v ), and three of them regularize the meter. Two of these verse interpolations emphasize parallel grammatical constructions: 'The sea will ebbe and flow, heaven will show his face' (M1 v ), and 'a husband / Hast thou of me, and she is for a wife' (P5 v ). Compositor C's most significant interpolation is the new speech-prefix on L3 v , 512. He attempts to correct the quarto's reading that gives the whole speech (504-525) to an unannounced, and thereafter silent, Queen. However, as Furness notes, the comma after Boyet is puzzling: 10 Why did Compositor C split the speech between the missing Queen and the Princess, rather than give the whole speech to the Princess? Compositor D inserts several interpolations more important than Compositor C's. Four of Compositor D's six interpolations in verse lines disrupt the regular meter (L5, 988, N4, O5 v , and P1). On the other two occasions, where he keeps the meter regular, he substantially changes the line. On L2 he has changed the quarto, 'Clymbe ore the house to unlocke the little gate' to 'That were to clymbe ore the house to unlocke the gate.' The change seems pointless; neither his interpolation nor his omission is an improvement over the original, nor does there seem to be some circumstantial reason for the change. The addition of passionate on N6 is a similar mystery. Although interpolations are not as important as the other kinds of changes, they provide a neat final example of how these compositors differ: Compositor D adds words in verse more often than in prose and spoils the regular meter; Compositor C adds words in prose more often than in verse and supports a regular meter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II I shall now briefly consider some pages of the other comedies, for which the copy is lost, that were set by Compositors C and D. Since his errors are more obvious, Compositor D's work has been emended more than Compositor C's—even though Compositor C makes more frequent and more serious errors. In the future, editors should examine Compositor C's pages more closely and emend more liberally. Some of the established emendations of Compositor C's work are corrections of his characteristic errors. A simple and obvious change that Compositor C makes is shortening or lengthening a word. A good example is 'hundred psalms' for what should probably be 'hundredth psalm' in line 607 of Wiv . 11 Another example involves upon/on . All recent editors of Err have emended on to upon in line 105, 'We were encountered by a mighty rocke, / Which being violently borne up, / Our helpefull ship was splitted' (104-106). 12 A related emendation is upon us for upon's in 'I'le bring thee to the present businesse / Which now's upon's: without the which, this Story' ( Tmp , 239-240). 13 In this example the verse would not have fitted into one line if Compositor C had not contracted either now's or upon's ; we know that Compositor C will solve his spacing problems through contractions, and upon's (because it is more awkward than now's , though it does appear elsewhere in the Folio) is a likely instance. Knowing that Compositor C is prone to corruptions that involve contractions should help an editor choose between possible emendations. For example, let's alone in 'what doe you mean / To doate thus on such luggage? let's alone / And doe the murther first' ( Tmp , 1905) has been emended to let's along by Theobald, let it alone by Hanmer, let't alone by Rann, and let's all on by Wilson; Rann's emendation has been chosen by recent editors of Tmp . Not only is Rann's emendation more economical, it also emends the part that Compositor C is more likely to have corrupted. When an editor suspects an error of substitution, he should recall that Compositor C tries to carry too much text in his head and is therefore susceptible to having a word or phrase influence other words. For example, a line that Compositor C set, 'To seeke thy helpe by beneficial helpe' ( Err , 154), has been emended by changing the first helpe to something else, usually healthe in recent editions. 14 We know that Compositor C's substitutions were often synonyms that need not be orthographically similar; thus, other emendations, like life (Rowe, accepted by Hardin Craig) or hope (Collier), are possible. Another example may be the repetition of worth in 'To be of worth, and worthy estimation' ( TGV , 706). Though recent editors have not felt the need to emend the line (partly because worth is repeated frequently throughout this scene and the rest of the play), I think Collier's emendation, wealth , should be given stronger consideration now that we know more about the frequency of Compositor C's substitutions. A different kind of error of substitution to which Compositor C is prone is correcting apparent corruptions in his copy, like malapropisms. Slender, referring to a marriage proposal, in Wiv says, 'I hope upon familiarity will grow more content' (229). This sentence follows and precedes malapropisms, and I think Theobald was correct in emending content to contempt . 15 Detailed knowledge of Compositor C may also help us spot likely omissions or interpolations. In MM , 'and have found it' (1828) is the last part of a verse crammed into the top line of G2b (the top half of this column has other signs of crowding). Two recent editors, R. C. Bald and G. Blakemore Evans, have left this line alone, but I think J. W. Lever is right in asserting that a monosyllable has been dropped. 16 Spacing is not the only possible reason for the omission; the Folio line has ten syllables and would satisfy Compositor C's usual desire for a regular line. Unfortunately, our knowledge of Compositor C's habits does not help in this instance to select an emendation. When looking for possible corruptions in Compositor D's pages, an editor should recall Compositor D's habit of misreading words and his particular fondness for adding or dropping a final s. A list of some Folio readings in Err and the emendations adopted by past editors coincide strikingly with Compositor D's habitual corruptions: scoure/score (230), God/God's (258), liberties/libertines (268), stranger/stronger (569), wise/wife (812), sister/sister's (833), bud/bed (836), sweet/sweat (1136), on/one (1143), and ships/ship (1218). 17 Seven of these proposed emendations come from the Second Folio and are merely corrections of literals. A similar list can be made for each of the plays Compositor D worked in. Another possible example of Compositor D's most common error is in the line, 'What knowes the Lawes' ( MM , 473), which has been variously emended to read 'What know the Laws' (Rowe), 'What knowes the Law' (Dyce), and 'Who knows the Laws' (Wilson). Clearly the third emendation is the least apt, given Compositor D's treatment of final s. Recent editors of MM have kept the Folio reading, but this is another reading that I think should be reconsidered. An emendation that replaces a word set by Compositor D should be orthographically similar to the Folio reading, if possible. Line 440 of AYL refers to Celia as 'taller' than Rosalind, but the opposite is true elsewhere. Editors have roughly split between shorter and smaller as emendations. If the inconsistency is due to compositorial error, then it is much more likely that Compositor D should have set smaller than shorter . A similar choice of emendations occurs in MM with 'headstrong weeds' (310), often emended as steeds , wills , deeds , or jades . Lever argues, following Bald, that jades "could have been misread in Shakespeare's handwriting." 18 This is exactly the kind of argument that one can make about Compositor D's work, except steeds seems even more apt than jades . Also in MM , Compositor D is responsible for one of the famous textual cruxes of the First Folio, 'Some rise by sinne, and some by vertue fall / Some run from brakes of Ice, and answere none' (492-493). Numerous emendations have been offered for 'brakes of Ice,' with 'through brakes of Vice' (Rowe) and 'breaks of Ice' (Collier) the two most popular choices. 19 We now know that Compositor D's substituitons rarely involve only the initial letter; his three substitutions of the initial letter are ye to he , you to thou , and Farborough to Tharborough —the last two might even be considered spelling variants. He did not omit the initial letter in any of the words he set from quarto copy. On the other hand, he seems prone to vowel changes, especially when two conjunct vowels are involved; he can either add a vowel, as in bonds to bounds (N5, 1088), or drop one, as in tainted to tanted (P3 v , 1421). 20 Thus, 'breaks of Ice' is the emendation that best accounts for the kind of misreading typical of Compositor D. An insoluble, but interesting, crux set by Compositor D occurs in the passage in AWW , 'Love no god, that would not extend his might onelie, where qualities were level, Queene of Virgins, that would suffer her poor surpris'd without rescue' (V3, 434-437). Theobald's emendation, 'Diana no Queene of Virgins,' has been commonly accepted, and the new information about Compositor D's habits supports the assertion that something has been omitted. We now know that Compositor D's most serious corruptions were omissions. He skips lines or phrases in his quarto copy on four occasions. Though he does not omit a proper name from his quarto copy, he does drop sir twice and Maister once. Unfortunately, we cannot point to an analogous situation in the pages he set from the quartos that could suggest how to emend this passage—or support Theobald's obviously sound choice. I hope that I have suggested some valuable ways the information in this article can be applied. Some of it should be immediately useful. Knowing that Compositor C, and not Compositor D, is willing to tamper with the text to achieve a smoother line or solve spacing problems and that he is susceptible to frequent memorial errors should define new boundaries within which editors practice the art of emendation. Other parts of the essay may be helpful as a standard for further comparisons with the other Folio compositors. As Dr. Walker discovered when comparing Compositors A and B, significant qualitative distinctions can be, and should be, made among the Folio compositors.

      <field name="heading_text">Chetwin, Crooke, and the Jonson Folios by William P. Williams *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of the 1640 folio edition of Ben Jonson's Works is, in the words of Percy Simpson, a "record of muddle, evasion, and dishonesty." 1 Much of the evidence has been set out by Simpson and Greg, 2 but new information and new interpretations of old information which further our knowledge of the history of the Jonson folios, and particularly the folios of 1640-41, have not been assembled in a single presentation before. I intend to describe briefly the history of the publication and ownership of Jonson's works, and in the process to add some additional evidence about the folios and their publishers with the hope of bringing some order out of the "muddle." There is little confusion about the so-called "first volume" of Jonson's works; the plays and poems making up this volume were those which Jonson collected in the folio of 1616 (hereafter I F1). This collection was published by William Stansby, with Richard Meighen having a minor interest in it as bookseller. 3 On 4 March 1639 this body of works was transferred from Stansby to Richard Bishop, the latter having acquired the rights to Every Man Out of His Humour from John Smethwick on 28 April 1638. In 1640 Bishop brought out a reprint of this collection under his imprint (hereafter I F2), with Andrew Crooke designated as the bookseller in the imprint of the general title-page. "Volume I" of the works was not printed again until 1692. The so-called "second volume" presents the greatest confusion. An edition was printed in 1631 by John Beale for Robert Allot (hereafter II F1). The first issue of this edition had no general title-page, the leaf A1 which was later used for this purpose being a blank in the first issue. However, the individual title-pages of the three plays which make up this volume all bear the imprint "I. B. for Robert Allot . . . 1631." (The plays were Bartholomew Fair , The Staple of News , and The Devil is an Ass .) Only The Staple of News had been entered in the Stationers' Register , being transferred from John Waterson to Allot on 7 September 1631, Waterson having entered it originally on 14 April 1626, although he never printed it. Furthermore, Greg is of the opinion that the original intention of Jonson and Allot had been to produce a companion volume for I F1 and that the project failed; therefore, he feels that probably very few copies of II F1 were issued between 1631 and 1640 (III, 1075-76). In any event, Robert Allot died in 1635, his will being dated 18 October and proved on 10 November of that year. 4 Among the provisions of his will was the passing on of all his copies to his wife Mary and a gift of £20 to his "servant" Andrew Crooke on condition that he serve Mary Allot for three more years. It will be recalled that Andrew Crooke was to be a bookseller of I F2 in 1640. Further, Crooke had been Allot's apprentice, being freed on 26 March 1629, 5 but apparently staying on to work for his former master. Within a year Mary Allot was ready to remarry, but her future husband, Philip Chetwin, was a Clothworker, and Mary believed that her marriage outside the Stationers' Company invalidated her rights to retain ownership of her former husband's copyrights. On 7 November 1636 Philip Chetwin appeared before the Stationers' Court to request the transfer of "all" Allot copies to Andrew Crooke and John Legatt, a printer. The transaction was so complete that on the same day at the same court Chetwin paid £6 to clear the ownership rights of Mirror for Martyrs , ostensibly for the benefit of Crooke and Legatt. But in all the transactions of that date, the only specific title mentioned was the Mirror for Martyrs . 6 By the following spring it had been brought to the attention of the Company that the new owners had not yet entered their new property, although they were printing and/or publishing it. On 3 April 1637 the Court of the Company took the following action: Whereas the Copies of M r . Allott deceased by order of this Co rt . the 7 th . of November last were Conferred vpon M r . Legatt and Andrew Crooke and soe to be entered vnto them according to the Custome of this Company in the Register booke of the Entry of Copies. Now forasmuch as notice hath byn giuen them to Enter their Copies but they hitherto haue neglected the same, But since the said grant to them doe print diuers of the said Copies. It is this day ordered. That if the said Legatt and Crooke doe not Enter their Copies betweene this and the next Co rt . leaue shall be giuen for the printing of them for the Companies vse (Jackson, p. 294). The next meeting of the Court was 27 April 1637, but for whatever reasons, Crooke and Legatt did not enter their copies until 1 July 1637. The list of titles they did enter was only sixty-one items long, far short of the number of titles Allot had owned. The missing title of greatest concern to us here is Jonson's The Devil is an Ass , and its omission is even more curious since its two companion plays from II F1, Bartholomew Fair and The Staple of News , are present in the Crooke and Legatt entry. They also failed to enter twenty-nine other titles which Allot had owned by virtue of entry in the Stationers' Register , and forty-three unentered titles of which Allot may have owned all or part. 7 Furthermore, a check of the known publications by Crooke and Legatt during 1636-38, the period complained of at the Stationers' Court on 3 April, shows that only Bayly's Practice of Piety in 1638 (STC 1618a), T. Hooker's Souls Humiliation in 1637 (STC 13728), and Sandys' Relation of a Journey also in 1637 (STC 21730) could be the offending publications. As we shall see, a legal battle eventually raged about the ownership of the immensely popular Practice of Piety , and the action of the Stationers' Court might only have been the first salvo. 8 Another work, Byfield's Marrow , which appeared in 1636 and 1640 (STC 4224 and 4225), had been jointly entered by Allot and Legatt on 3 July 1628 and could not have presented much of a legal problem. Mary Allot Chetwin also continued to publish, for between Robert Allot's death and the end of 1636 she brought out two works, Perkins, Foundation of the Christian Religion (STC 19720) and Crawshey's The Countrymans Instructor (STC 6033). By the end of 1637 Crooke and Legatt legally controlled most of the Allot copyrights, including at least two-thirds of the contents of II F1. However, the remainders of this edition present a problem. As I have noted earlier, Greg believes that very few copies were issued before 1640, and the ensuing publication history indicates a large stock of these remainders must have still existed at Allot's death. Who then had physical control of these copies from 1636 onwards? The answer, until now, has been that Richard Meighen controlled the stock, for he issued all three plays from Allot's remainders in one volume in 1640 (STC 14754) with a general title-page, the formerly blank A1, the imprint of which read simply: " LONDON , | Printed for Richard Meighen, | 1640." (II F2). Greg's opinion is "that Meighen owned the stock of the three plays [because] . . . in 1653 and 1656 his widow and successors were advertising The Devil is an Ass separately" (III, 1077). Meighen had been involved in the publication of I F1 in 1616 and it was not at all improbable that some unknown private arrangement had been worked out with Robert Allot, or Mary Allot, or Philip Chetwin, or Crooke and Legatt, or any combination thereof. However, there was some trouble about the ownership of The Devil is an Ass , the one play which had not been transferred, for on 6 June 1640, John Hansley, the Chaplain of the Bishop of London and a licenser of books, wrote on the last page of a 1631 (II F1) copy of the play: "Let this be entered for Andrew Crooke but not printed till I give further directions." 9 There are at least two possible explanations of this note by Hansley. First, it might simply be that Crooke and Legatt had become aware of the omission of The Devil is an Ass from their transfer entry of Allot's copies and were attempting to assure their claim to the work. This is somewhat unsatisfactory, however, for it would have been easier for them to do this by working within the Stationers' Company rather than by appealing for judgment to someone outside the Company. A second explanation is that Meighen's issue of II F2, in 1640, from the remainders of II F1, might have provoked Crooke and Legatt to press their claims of ownership of the three plays. However, because of their tardiness in entering two of the plays, and their total failure to enter the third, they felt compelled to seek some sort of outside authority to substantiate their claims. Although both of these suppositions seem plausible on the surface, when one digs deeper one comes on an amazing and complex legal tangle which no doubt explains why anyone in any way connected with Philip Chetwin would be seeking to reaffirm his claims to publishable property. From 1637 to at least 1639 Crooke and Legatt had been involved in a court battle with Chetwin. Chancery Bill Chas. I C30/36, Chetwynd vs. Crooke, etc. comprises three lengthy documents. Although the length of these and other Chancery documents cited later is such that it would be impossible to present a full transcription here, a summary and partial transcription of their contents will be of great interest, for they amplify the activities of Crooke, Legatt, and the Chetwins which we have, heretofore, been dealing with only by inference and guess (the formulaic "the defendant" or "this defendant" is rendered with the appropriate surname or pronoun in italic, and occasionally "the or this Complainant" is treated in a similar manner; italic in square brackets indicates conjectural readings where the manuscripts are defective). Chas. I C30/36 Chetwynd vs. Crooke, etc. Document I [1638?] Crooke sets out the details of his relationship with Allot, saying he served him eleven years and that on Allot's deathbed in October of 1635, he asked Crooke to serve Mary Allot for three years after his death. He did promise that "he should remaine with her. But Crooke denyeth that he did promise to the said Robert Allott that he . . . would serve Mary Allot as her servant and shoopkeeper . . . for any other certeyne tyme or that he did vndertake or promise to the said Robert Allott to Convert the stocke of the said Robert Allott into readie money or to" settle his accounts. Crooke goes on to explain that Allot left him a legacy of £20 and he was also to be paid £25 per year as salary. He also says he does not know if Allot's estate was worth £14,000 at his death, but gives his opinion that it may have been half that much. Crooke says he only collected debts at the "appointment" of Mary and that he took no printed books from the stock for his own benefit. In general, Crooke says that he ran the business much as it had been run during his eleven years of service in Robert Allot's lifetime. "And Crooke haueing after the decease of his said late M tr remained in the said service of Mary Allot vntill about August followinge and the Contageon of the Plague then increasinge . . . he went into the Country and whilst he remained in the Cuntry the Comp lte Phillip that had as Crooke was informed become a sutor to the said Mary in the way of Marriadge And before Crooke retoered to London . . . Came to Crooke in the Cuntry . . . and did perswade him to stay two or three yeares with him in case the said Marriadge should take effect then promisinge Crooke if he would there vnto assent . . . that at the end there of Crooke should haue the house and shopp wherein . . . Mary then lived with the wares that should be then therein at a reasonable rate and made many other promises to Crooke . . . pretending to him that he was out of hope the said Marriadge should take effect vnlesse Crooke would vndertake this. Crooke answered that he . . . would be ready to doe any thinge that was fitt soe as he . . . might haue the shoppe and wares and the Coppies of books . . . after three yeares. . . ." Chetwin agreed, Crooke shortly returned to London, and Philip and Mary were to be married. Then Mary learned that according to the rules of the Company of Stationers that "vnlesse the widdowe of a freeman of that Company doe in her widdoehood assigne ouer all her originall Coppies of bookes whereof she had the sole printinge or as printer with any other she should forfeit all Coppies [ if she ] did marry any but a freeman of the same Company of Staconers. But Crooke doth not remember that he did first informe . . . Mary. . . ." Crooke says it is not material since this was the case whether or not he told her [see Chancery Bill Chas. I C48/5, Chetwyn vs. Nevill]. " Crooke saith that Mary Allot therevpon intending as it seemed to have such an assignment made to John Legate, one of the defend ts in the [ bill of complaint ] . . . [Crooke says that he] might say that it was to great a trust for one man and that it would be a disparadgment to the shoppe . . . [but he did] not say or Contend that it would be a disparadgment to the defend et [Crooke] not to be trusted as well as the said John Legate. And Crooke saith it is true that about the tyme in the Chetwins ' bill . . . such a deed of Assignment [illegible] . . . Mary in her widdowehood and a little before her entermarriage with . . . Phillip Chettwinde vnto the said John Legate and Crooke but the certeyne date there of he doth not remember." Crooke says that all the details of the "trust" were set out in the deed of assignment but if any copies of it exist they are in Chetwin's custody. Shortly after the signing and sealing of the deed Philip and Mary married. After the marriage Crooke and Legatt "did become interessed in the estate of the said . . . Mary and of the Coppies soe intrusted in the said John Legate and Crooke . . . and Crooke denyeth that he did refuse to make any accompting . . . concerninge the estate . . . [and Mary] held her selfe satisfied. And Crooke saith that after the said Assignment made and the Comp lts entermarriage he did refuse to serve the Comp lts for the tearme of three yeares as they desired vnlesse that he be [ assured ] he should haue the said house and shoppe and all the stocke of books that should be then remaininge and all the originall coppies and right of printing them as the said Phillip Chetwinde had at first p ro mised. . . . Crooke saith that . . . Phillip Chetwinde and Crooke about the tyme in the Comp lts bill menconed came to an agreement which was set downe in a certeyne booke of Articles. . . . And Crooke further saith that . . . Phillip Chetwynde in and by the said Articles did covenant and agree from tyme to tyme to furnish the said shoppe with [ wares ] from the king's Printing house and from the Company of Staconers and alsoe all other readie money books and other books sufficient to mainteyne the trade. And alsoe that . . . Chetwin whoe was ignorant [ of the trade ] should not either by himselfe or any act of his directly or indirectly sell any booke or bookes by whole sale or by retaile to any of the company of Staconers or to any other man duringe the said time of three yeares without the consent of Crooke but should [ leave all the business to the ] manniaginge of Crooke as in former tyme it was vsed except only in such p ar ticular things as were specially lymitted directed and declared by the said booke of Articles. And Crooke saith there were certeyne other thinges conteyned in the said booke of Articles [ on ] behalfe of Chetwin to haue bin p er formed. . . . [ And ] both p ar ties should enter into two Thousand pound bonds each to other to stand to the Arbitrament and aprisement of fower indiferent men of the trade. . . . Crooke agrees that he . . . should have the whole manageing of the whole shoppe stocke and trade and that the said Chetwin should not sell any books without the privitie of Crooke . . . ." On the morning of Crooke's return to London the Articles were signed and sealed by Crooke, Legatt, and Chetwin and copies were to be made, and Crooke adds that he never himself, or in combination with others, sought to deceive Chetwin. "But Crooke denieth that he was to haue the Mannageinge of the whole shoppe stocke and trade otherwise then he had in the widdowehood of the said Comp lt Mary and as a servant to both the Comp llts . . . . neither had he the estate deliv r ed vnto him or the booke by catologe or ever any chardge but what other servants had the like. . . ." After her marriage to Chetwin Mary still kept "with her one of the servants which shee formerly had in her widdoehood whoe had the keepeinge of the [ accounts ]. . . . And the said Comp lts or one of them had sould or caused to be sould [ some ] books and taken moneys and received debts of which they haue not so much as informed Crooke . . . . Crooke saith that the said Comp lte did not from tyme to tyme furnish the shoppe [ with money and/or wares ] . . . but hath treated with diverse about the sale of the said shoppe and books menconed in the said Articles whereby he thinketh to defeate Crooke of his said bargaine. . . ." Chetwin also sold "Dalton's iustice of pease [Michael Dalton, Country Justice , entered to the Stationers' Company 8 July 1618 and published by them in 1618, 1619, 1622, 1626, and 1635; STC 6205-6208 and 6211; editions were published for the assigns of J. More in 1630 and 1635 (STC 6209-6210) and for Richard Best in 1643 (Wing D143)] which he tooke out of the warehouse without Crooke's consent to the great prejudice of Crooke . . . . Phillip Chetwinde before christmas last past [1637?] did give fourth in speeces that Crooke should not haue his bargaine accordinge to the Articles and that none should sett a value on Crooke . . . ." Crooke then went to the Stationers' Company about the problem and made the same complaint about Chetwin. Chetwin took the "booke of Articles from the said John Legate to the end they might bee transcribed by a scrivenor and an other coppie written verbatim and hath ever since kept the same. . . . Crooke denieth that Chetwin did about christmas one Thousand sixe hundred thirty and sixe or at any other tyme require then Crooke's . . . [ accounts ] . . . or otherwise did the Comp lt require any accompt from Crooke about Christmas one Thousand sixe hundred thirty and seaven. . . ." Crooke concludes by saying he ran the shop as it had always been run and that Chetwin simply does not know how the book trade operates. Document II [1638?] Crooke denies that he has in any way wrongfully kept the accounts of the business, or extended credit except as Chetwin dictated (£20 limit for customers not known to him and no limit for those known to him) and Chetwin, he hears, has not really tried to bring in the debts outstanding. He denies that he "put any of y e Comp lts parte into his private purse or that he did omitt to ent er the receipt thereof into the Comp lts books when he did receive any moneys when the receipt thereof was vsed to be entered into the Comp lts books." He also denies lending money or books which belonged to Chetwin. " Crooke doth Confesse y t he hath deliued out books to Minist rs &amp; others vpon likinge &amp; if disliked then to be retourned as is vsed amonge staconers but they were . . . [ entered on ] a Slate kept for y t purpose or some other noate of remembrance made of them. . . . Crooke denieth y t he hath . . . the shoppe at the next dore or y t he hath any shoppe at all but had formerly put them all off . . . purposolie in hope y t accordinge to the Articles he should haue had the Comp lts Shoppe house goods etc. where he had him an apprentice &amp; [was] best knowne." He denies that he in any way took for himself any of Robert Allot's estate or Chetwin's, except what was rightfully his. Crooke then says that Chetwin owes him money (mostly back wages and his legacy from Allot) of over £200. He denies any connection with Miles Flesher and/or Francis Quarles (also being complained of by Chetwin in Chancery Bill Chas. I C105/28) except to sell them things as Chetwin's agent. He says he also bought paper and books from Thomas Dainty for Chetwin's use and for his own use, but he always distinguished between the two in the accounts (Chetwin is also complaining against Dainty in Chancery Bill Chas. I C28/67). Crooke says that he is informed that while drunk Chetwin said that "he would sinke all his whole estate rather then y t he would be curbed by Crooke in y e diference betweene them. . . ." Crooke also says that Chetwin has said that Crooke spent £600 of Allot's money while he was his apprentice and servant, and that Chetwin will seek his arrest on the grounds of breaking the £2,000 bond entered into with Legatt and Chetwin at the signing of the Articles. Crooke finally asks that the case be dismissed. Document III Crooke says that the warehouse book will show that he did not, as Chetwin has charged in his bill of complaint, "printe or cause to be printed or sould any prohibited or other booke for which Chetwin was questioned before the Lords of his Ma ties hon ble privie Counsell [illegible] the terme of three yeares to vse the Trade of a Staconer, and noe longer as in and by the said bill of Chetwin is vntruelie surmised and pretended. But Crooke saith it is true Chetwin was questioned [ by the ] most hon ble prive Counsle about December one Thousand six hundred thirty seaven for a bold Contempt against the Company of Staconers in serchinge for bibles bonde without Geneologies which Chetwin himselfe bought [ and ] intended to sell againe without any direccōn of Crooke and was therefore fined about twentie shillings towards the reparacōn s of S t Pauls church London which he beleeves is not yet paid. . . . Chetwin received a verie greate fauor from their Lord pps in grantinge him any leave at all to vse the said trade of a Staconer for that there is a Decree in his Ma ties high court of Starr Chamber . . . one Thousand six hundred Thirty seaven that noe man whoe had not served seven yeares a prentice to the Trade of a booke seller should vse that trade at all. . . . Crooke saith that it is true that he did buie quanities of pap er and Chardged the said Comp lte Phillip Chetwinde as debtor for the same . . . [but he] saith that he did not buie any pap er more then what was neccesarie for the trade and spent and disposde to and for the said Comp ltes vse and entered in his bookes . . . and for what vse and at what price and tyme and what quantities. And Crooke saith it is likewise true that he did buie some parts in other shopps in London and Ireland but denieth it was with the Comp lts [ money or that he did ] ffurnish the said shopps or any of them with any of the Comp lts books other then such as the Comp lts had ample satisffaccon for. . . . and Crooke did leaue of one Printer Richard Badger by the direccon of . . . Phillip Chetwinde whoe was then at varience with Badger . . . [ and ] George Miller [Badger's partner] because he was not at leasure (as he affirmed [)] to printe the p ar ts of a booke he had vsed to printe and the worke requiringe haste Crooke did imploy two other printers . . . both which had benie formerlie imployed to printe for the said Shopp and all ways knowne to be verie able workemen and fithfull and honest in theire profession. But Crooke vterlie denieth that he [ employed them ] to any such purpose as in the bill is surmised neither had Crooke any chardge to the Contrary from the Comp lte who knew they were imployed. . . . ever since the said Articles of Agreement were sealed the books did become in . . . Crooke's name for that Chetwin was not capable to have them [ for he was ] not free of the Company of Staconers and for that Crooke had agreed for them as by the said Articles of Agreement more at lardge it doth and may appeare." Crooke and Chetwin agreed together on what to print but only one half of the copies of one book were given to the printer Turner [the title is illegible in the document]. Crooke maintains that Allot had always had such an arrangement with Turner and Huggins [both of Oxford, see Madan, Volume II]. Turner paid £5 to Huggins to have sole rights to print the book and Turner paid £5 to Chetwin and printed the whole book. Crooke denies that he tampered with the working relationships in the trade which Allot had set up during his lifetime. Crooke also says he ordered impressions and disbursed money only for the benefit of Chetwin as was his trust. And regarding a "booke called Gwillimes Display of Heraldry [entered to J. Bloome 27 April 1631 and 1 June 1635; transferred to Crooke 29 May 1655; published in 1632 (STC 12502), Badger for Bloome; 1635 (STC 12503), T. Cotes for Bloome; transferred to R. Bloome 17 May 1671; published 1660 and 1664 (Wing G2219-G2220), T. R. for R. Bloome] Crooke saith it true that hee . . . did buie about fiue hundred &amp; twenty of them and as Crooke beleeveth at fiue shillings . . . [ nor did he put a ] price in a booke cheeper then others were to pay for the like booke. . . . And Crooke denyeth that he did put any higher price vpon the said books . . ." and Chetwin had the accounts to look at anyway. Crooke bought other books to make sure that the business of the shop did not fail. Crooke admits he bought books without Chetwin's consent, but says it was impossible to get it because books were often called for on a demand basis and the customers would have gone to other shops to get them otherwise; Chetwin did not understand the trade anyway. Of the 2,000 copies of Ruefuers' Trimball (?) there was apparently a three-year discount clause on unsold copies, and Crooke says he would have taken them off Chetwin's hands. Crooke denies that he put any "excessive rates" upon any books he bought for Chetwin. And Chetwin refused to barter, trade, or exchange copies. Crooke denies that he bought Norwood's Fortification [entered 12 August 1637 to Crooke; published 1639 (STC 18690), T. Cotes for A. Crooke; next published in 1679; never transferred] for Chetwin. 1,000 were done for Crooke, and Chetwin "beinge ignorant in the trade of a booke seller," Crooke was left to do as he thought fit. Crooke denies that he sold any books which were not his to sell to other stationers in London or to country booksellers. He also denies he took any money for himself from the sale of Chetwin's books. He mentions the printing of a speech before the Star Chamber and says he offered to give a full accounting of all he had done [the remainder of the document is illegible]. All these charges and counter charges make clear the sort of problems which Crooke saw in the business partnership with Chetwin. However, in a bill of complaint filed in Chancery by Chetwin in 1639 we are able to see Chetwin's side of the matter. Chas. I C28/67 Chetwynd (Philip and Mary) vs. Miles Flesher and Thomas Dainty Document I (Chetwin's bill of complaint) [1639] Chetwin begins by stating that Allot had many copies and the wares of a stationer and that Andrew Crooke was his servant. Four years ago Allot died [1635, thus this document is filed in 1639]. Chetwin recounts the deathbed requests made to Crooke [they are essentially those found in the other Chancery documents]. By Allot's will Mary was made sole heir, Crooke got £20 and £25 more annually for three years. Allot told Crooke to buy no new books but to print and sell his copies for Mary's use. On 9 October in the "11th year of his majesty's reign" [1635] the will was made with an estate valued at £14,000. Crooke possessed himself of the estate to manage it for Mary. Sales of books for the first year were over £2,000. When Mary and Chetwin planned to marry, Crooke told her she would forfeit all rights to original copies unless she assigned them to a stationer during her widowhood since she was marrying outside the Company [according to Chancery Bill Chas. I C48/5, Neville told her this]. Mary was going to assign all the copies to John Legatt [he had been a partner with Allot from time to time] because she trusted him, but Crooke said it was too great a trust for one man and besides it made Crooke look bad. A deed was made from Mary Allot to them and on the "ffirst day of November in the Twelveth yeare of his Ma ts raigne [1636] did graunt bargaine and soe assigne and sett over vnto one John Legate . . . and [ Andrew Crooke ] their heires and Assignes all those Coppies of bookes w ch did belong to the said Robt Allott in his life tyme and all the . . . benifitt and advantage w ch might happen . . . by the printing of the same Coppies in trust now the lesse for the benefitt of the said Mary and her then intended husband [Philip Chetwin]. And for the better expressing of the same trust they the said John Legate and Andrewe Crooke by theire Indenture vnder theire hands and seales . . . and Chetwin and the said Mary . . . trusting the deede of graunt and assignment did expresse and declare that for the gaine and benefitt of Chetwin and the said Mary [they] did annexe the said Coppies in a Scedule to the sd Indenture and did there by . . . Agree . . . not to printe any of the said Coppies mencōned in the said scedule, and assigned over as afore said w t hout the Consent of Chetwin first had and . . . that they should giue waye from tyme to tyme for the printinge of such and soe manye of the said Coppies as Chetwin should desire to be printed [and they should] set the same to be printed to what p er son or p er sons they pleased and [ Chetwin ] to haue the full gaine and benefitt by the printinge there of. . . . and that he [Crooke] should not sell or cause to be sould . . . during that tyme of Three yeares directly or indirectly by himselfe or others by word or otherwise to any whole sale Chapman or retayle Customer then vseing to buye . . . [ from ] the said Robt Allott. . . . [and] that the said Andrewe Crooke for the tyme afore said should not directly nor directly [ sic ] make any greate exchanges of bookes, w t hout the Consent of Chetwin . . . ." All disputes were to be arbitrated by indifferent men who were stationers. Chetwin was to view the accounts from time to time and to pay the debts, and Crooke was responsible for all losses due to servants [i.e., thefts and breakage]. Chetwin was to retain the house and shop of Allot until the end of the three-year term and then Crooke could buy it for what Allot had given, the price to be set by an appraisal by four indifferent men of the Stationers' Company, and if they could not agree, by two more [these men also seem to have been intended to appraise and set a price on the stock of books and value of original copies]. Chetwin and Crooke were to enter in £5,000 bonds. Crooke was to make a down payment of £500 and give security against the remainder and to have the entire management of the "shop and trade." The signed and sealed Articles were, by mutual consent, deposited with Legatt. But Crooke tried to defraud the Chetwins by associating himself with Miles Flesher and Francis Quarles to possess Chetwin's estate and profit from it, and Legatt was also implicated. About Christmas 1636 Chetwin asked to see Crooke's accounts for the period of Mary's widowhood but Crooke delayed in presenting them. About Christmas 1637 he asked again and Crooke said it would be very difficult to present them. Chetwin then told Crooke to buy a new set of record books for the use of the shop, but Crooke continued to keep bad, or no, records so that a total of six [ sic : only four years could have elapsed] years eventually were unaccounted for, and Chetwin says he was worried about the business. Crooke also printed, or caused to be printed, books without the consent of, or benefit of, Chetwin. Chetwin says he paid a fine to practice the trade of a stationer for a term of three years, and when he took over the business he found that Crooke and Legatt had printed the works assigned over to them on paper charged to Chetwin. Crooke caused books to be printed in London and Ireland by printers not previously uesd so that Crooke could sell them without Chetwin knowing about it; also the books which were specifically excluded from reprinting were produced in new impressions. Crooke used Chetwin's money to buy books which were "dead Comodityes and not vsually vendible as namely a book Called Gwillmes display of Heraldrye where of the said Andrewe did buy ffive hundred [ copies ] of the booke and in further deceipt of Chetwin did Cause the person of whom he bought the same to . . . [ put the ] prise of sixe shillings vpon Chetwin's Accompt . . . and bought two thousand bookes of an other person Called Rufuers Trimball [?] and did other perches of bookes whout any Consent of Chetwin and att excessiue and fayned rates. . . ." Crooke also sold to chapmen without consent and bought Norwood's Fortification , another "dead Comoditye" and paid out "readye money" for them, and had them put in the warehouse. Crooke pretended that copies bought with Chetwin's money were his own and Chetwin says that "Andrewe contrarye to his said trust did alsoe print or Cause to be printed the Coppies of a booke belonginge to one Badger by reason where of Chetwin was [ found ] gueltie. . . ." Crooke continued to misrepresent the accounts and "concerninge Gerrads hearball [Gerard's Hearball , entered 6 June 1597 by John Norton, transferred to R. Whitaker 26 August 1632, transferred to Adam Islip 13 July 1634; published 1597 by B. and J. Norton (STC 11750), 1633 by Islip, Norton, and Whitaker (STC 11751), 1636 by the same three (STC 11752)] &amp; Perkinsons hearball [probably John Parkinson, Theatrum botanicum . . . or an herball , entered by Richard Cotes 3 March 1635; published in 1640 by T. Cotes (STC 19302), no edition is recorded in Wing] beinge things of grate value, and . . . Crooke did pretend that the same were his true books and did refuse to deli v d them to Chetwin ." Also, Legatt apparently informed Chetwin of thousands of pounds of debts incurred by Allot. Chetwin did not know Crooke, Legatt, Thomas Dainty, Miles Flesher, and Francis Quarles had had improper financial dealings with his stock in the amount of £5,000. Then Crooke set up his own trade at the shop next door and all the customers went there. Crooke had said, when Allot died, that Crooke's estate was worth only about £500 but now it is worth £800. Crooke's associates, with his help, have claimed many debts against Chetwin and they have sued him for payment [Chetwin was apparently judged against but would not pay without specified accounts]. Finally, Chetwin asks that the Equity Decree for debt be nullified by Chancery. Document II (the answers of Miles Flesher and Thomas Dainty to Philip and Mary Chetwin's complaints) [1639] Flesher and Dainty begin their response by denying any knowledge of most of the matters mentioned by Chetwin in his bill against them. However, Flesher says he had sold books to Crooke worth £10, after Allot's death, for which he has been paid, and he believes they were for Chetwin and paid for with Chetwin's money, but he does not know it. Further, Chetwin owes Flesher, his partners, and other stationers £300, and has been asked to pay several times, and is now being sued. Both Flesher and Dainty have knowledge that Chetwin said in public that he would not pay unless sued. Flesher says this proceeding is a reprisal but they have not prosecuted their case. Dainty says he sold Crooke paper, but that it was charged to Crooke's account and Dainty believes he has been paid by Crooke with Crooke's own money. Within the last few months he has sold a large amount of paper to Crooke for Chetwin's use, worth £83, and Chetwin paid for it. Chetwin has refused to pay a later bill of £100. Chetwin said he would pay on a given day but six weeks or two months later, about September, when Dainty asked for it, Chetwin said he could not pay now for "hee was to pay two hundred pounds to the Kings Printer and one hundred pounds to the Company of Staconers. But if Dainty would take Bookes for the said debt of one hundred pounds he . . . would deliver vnto Dainty all the said debt in quarto bibles printed att Cambridge [see Chancery Bill Chas. I C30/36, Document II] at six shillings per Booke and that if hee had not Bibles enough to pay the said debt in that manner That then hee would deliuer to Dainty soe many of Martins Cronicles at six shillings per Booke or the practise of piety or any of the best bookes which the said Comp lte had in his warehouse to make vpp the said full some of one hundred pounds." Dainty said he would rather wait for the money. Three months later [December] Dainty went to Chetwin's house; Chetwin gave him "very faire words" and said he was going to take the whole trade of bookselling into his own hands. Dainty also sold more paper and some books, through Crooke, to Chetwin worth £87, on 18 June. The bill owed Dainty now comes to £188/1/8 d. of which he has received only £14/11/6 d . In Hillary Term last Dainty brought suit for recovery of debt. It seems from all this that Crooke and Legatt, although they claimed to have some sort of legal rights to the plays of Jonson, as part of the Chetwin trust arrangement, were certainly not, in 1640, in a position to assert beyond question their rights to own or control any of the Allot copies, including the 1631 remainder sheets. The complexity and financial difficulties of the agreement(s) between the Chetwins and Crooke and Legatt were such that by 1640 it would have been necessary to proceed very cautiously in any printing or publishing venture. In 1640 Crooke, Legatt, and John Benson were also engaged in a struggle over the control of the rest of Jonson's works, those titles which eventually made up the "third volume" of the works. John Benson had been one of Allot's apprentices too, being freed on 30 June 1631, 10 and would not only have known Crooke well from their days together in Allot's shop, but would also have been around those stationers involved in the production of the various volumes of Jonson's works (Allot, Stansby, Meighen, Bishop, etc.). On 16 December 1639 Benson entered the "Execration against Vulcan" and "Epigrams," on 18 February 1639/40 he entered "the Art of Poetry," and on 29 February 1639/40 he entered "The Masque of the Gypsies." In addition, Andrew or John Crooke and Richard Seirger, Junior, entered "The Masque of Augures," "Time Vindicated," "Neptunes Triumphs," and "Pan's Anniversary, or The Shepherds' Holiday," plus "sundry elegies and other poems by Ben. Johnson," all on 20 March 1639/40. Later in 1640 Benson did bring out a collection of these works, but in 12mo not folio. This was clearly an attempt on the part of Benson, Crooke, and others to get further rights to Jonson's works. However, another stationer, Thomas Walkley, had apparently been privately assured the role of publisher for all the works of Jonson not in print by the time of the poet's death by his literary executor, Sir Kenelm Digby. The plots and counterplots which followed have been well traced and documented by other scholars, 11 and it should suffice here to note that Walkley started litigation on 20 January 1639/40 over the rights to the titles in the "third volume" and this legal action, along with Chetwin's Chancery actions, may have been what prompted Crooke to seek Hansley's authority for The Devil is an Ass , since it was a Jonson title which was not properly entered to him. No matter what the reason for Hansley's note, it is interesting that he prohibited only the printing of The Devil is an Ass by Crooke, not its sale or distribution, and said nothing of the other two 1631 plays. The answer to the question of who controlled the 1631 stock actually lies three years beyond the 1640 publication date. On 4 December 1643 the following item appears in the Court Book of the Stationers' Company: This day Mr Downes and Mr Mead shewed vnto the Co rt the copie of a bill in the Chauncery brought ag t them and others of the Company by Mr Chetwin for seizing of sundry Play Bookes called the Divells an Asse (written by Ben: Johnson) and printed in the life tyme of Mr Allot, which said playes were then by war t seized vpon and kept by the Company yeares and afterwards by war t frō Sr Henry Herbert comaunded to bee delived to the sd Chetwyn and Chetwyn sett his hand for the receipt of them wherevpon the Court ordered that the said suite should bee defended at the cost of the Company and that the Clarke take care to appeare for them and solicite the said business. 12 "Yeares" may not be the most precise term we could wish for, but the time of seizure must have been in 1639 or 1640. Furthermore, the matter clearly concerns the 1631 remainders, "printed in the life tyme of Mr Allot," and is concerned with only one play, the untransferred The Devil is an Ass . We also have discovered a further reason for Crooke's rights in this play being certified by Hansley, to counter a similar document apparently asserting Chetwin's rights from Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels. 13 Finally, we now know where the remainder stock of at least one of the 1631 plays was: first with Chetwin, then with the Stationers' Company, and then, if the Company is to be believed, back to Chetwin. We are also fortunate that some of the documents of the law case mentioned in the Stationers' Court Book on 4 December 1643 survive. Strangely, the accused is not the Company or Downes and Mead, but Abraham Colt, and a summary of the contents of the case follows: Chas. I C19/23 Chetwin vs. Colt etc. Document I (Abraham Colt's answer to Philip and Mary Chetwin's bill) [11 December 1643] Colt was found to be bankrupt in 1638 and Richard Ballard, Maximilian Colt, his father, and Richard Hall were partners and/or kinsmen of Colt, and Colt also had business dealings with Thomas Downes and Robert Meade. Colt and Hall owed Ballard £100, Hall died, and Colt paid the debt to Ballard by assigning and giving to him 2,000 unbound copies of Practice of Piety . Colt insists that he did all this before he was declared to be bankrupt and his estate was registered in the Bankruptcy Commissioners' ledgers. "And after the Custome for the exportacon of these bookes out of England into Holland was paied at the Custome house in London [by Ballard] and alsoe very shortly after security was by bond given at the said Custome house in London that all the said Bookes should within Six Monthes then next followinge be exported into Holland and a Certificate brought from thence of theire beinge there landed the said Comp lt Chetwind did either by himselfe or by the said Thomas Downes and Robert Meade sease and carry away all the aforesaid Bookes and hath ever since most wrongfully and uniustly deteyned them from the def t Richard Ballard to his greate damage. And Colt beleeveth That the def t Richard Ballard did never adresse himselfe vnto the Master and Wardens of the Companie of Staconers for . . . satisfaccon. . . . But Colt doth knowe that . . . Ballard was w th some of the Companie of Statconers to be informed of them where and in whose hands and Custodie the said Twoe Thousand vnbound bookes were remayninge to thend he the said Richard Ballard might take some legall or equitable Course for the recovery of the said Bookes. And Colt denyeth that ever the said Thomas Downes and Robert Meade either by themselves or any others did perswade or advise Colt or . . . Ballard (to the knowledge of Colt [)] to sue the Comp lt Chetwind for the foresaid Twoe Thousand Bookes" or that Downes, Meade, or anyone ever promised to be a witness for Colt and Ballard in such an action against Chetwin. Finally, Colt says that because of the problem just explained, Ballard has never had the £100 debt which Colt owed him settled. Document II (Answer of Robert Meade and Thomas Downes to the bill of Philip and Mary Chetwin) [11 December 1643] " Downes and Meade for pleas and demurer to that p ar t of Chetwin's bill where by he chargeth them these defts or one of them or by some other of the M r and wardens of the Company of Staconers did seaze two thousand bookes called the practize of pietie and of the bookes called the diuell is an asse belonging to Robert Allott late husband of the Comp lt Mary who was and is executrix of the said Robert Allott for as much as the said seuerall charge are full of incertainty and doe not absolutly charge theise defts w th the seizing of the same books" and in Parliament, 19 February, 20 James I [1623/4] the Act of Trespass (the act which is being used in the complaint against them) has a limiting clause of two to three and five to six years and "the Comp lts eyther of them haue not brought any accon against theis defts or any of them w th in the time Lymited by the said Statute." Also there is no request for equity in the bill of complaint and they will answer no further charges. In addition, the Practice of Piety copies seized were printed "beyond the seas" [Crooke's Irish printing?, see Chancery Bill Chas. I C28/67, Document I, or Dutch printing, see Calendar of State Papers Domestic , 1637-1639 , p. 145, where Chetwin claims that the printing was done in Holland] without anyone's consent. Further, the bill does not state the number of copies seized or the date of the seizure. The bill does not state by what law, or Act of Parliament, the owner of the copies has a right to these copies. They make the same demurrer in the complaints against Ballard and Colt over the Practice of Piety (see Document I). "Touching the bookes called the diuell is an asse ther pretended by the Comp lt that theis defts seised &amp; denied the Complt to enter his coppie in the name of . . . Richard Meighen for that there is noe matter of equity conteined in the same charge and noe grounds . . ." they also refuse to answer the charges. Finally, they deny they conspired with anyone against anyone as complained of in the bill. Document III (answer of Richard Ballard to the bill of Philip and Mary Chetwin) [? December 1643] Ballard says he knows nothing of the Chetwins' situation with regard to Allot's copies and knows nothing of Colt's bankruptcy. The debt Colt owed Ballard was £100. He then discusses his financial dealings with Colt and the use of unbound copies of Practice of Piety to settle the debt. Ballard had documents allowing him to export the books to Holland, but then Chetwin seized and carried away all the copies [perhaps Practice of Piety and Devil is an Ass ], and has not paid for them or returned them. Ballard denies that he ever brought Chancery bills against Chetwin for this in combination with the principals or singly, and he denies that he has ever brought it before the Stationers' Company. Chetwin told Ballard he did not have the copies but that the Stationers' Company did, and Ballard went before the Company to see if he could get them back. Chetwin encouraged Ballard to sue the Company but Ballard did not. Ballard hopes the court will have Chetwin pay him for the books. If we are to believe the Company, all the seized copies were returned to Chetwin, and it appears that his suits in Chancery were over shortages in the stock after he had gotten it back from them, a shortage he apparently wishes to have made good by the accusations of trespass in the original seizure. Indeed, we know a shortage did develop in 1641, for in that year a second issue of II F2 appeared with The Staple of News and Bartholomew Fair still being made up of the 1631 remainders, but The Devil is an Ass being a reprint dated 1641. It is clear that in the course of 1641 the stock of The Devil is an Ass must have run out while sufficient copies of the other two plays remained to make it worth while reprinting. Several explanations might be suggested: an original shortage in the printing, and unusually large distribution of separate copies, or an accident to the stock. But none of these is particularly plausible, and there is some reason to suppose that part of the stock was in fact merely mislaid. This might easily have happened in view of the confusion over the rights and stock of the plays, and whereas it is clear that most copies were in Meighen's possession, we know that at least one copy was in the hand of Andrew Crooke since he submitted it for licence in June 1640. . . . That copies of the 1631 impression were available at a much later date appears from the fact that Richard Meighen's widow Mercy . . . advertising the play in 1653 . . . quoted the title of 1631 and not that of 1641. (Greg, III, 1077-78) If when the seized 1631 stock was returned these were mixed with 1641 reprints then most of the problems which Greg indicated vanish. If the available copies of The Devil is an Ass were augmented, first by a reprinting in 1641, and then by the return of a number of seized 1631 copies, then it is not at all strange that so many 1631 copies survived into the 1650s, and the printing of the 1641 edition was necessitated by the Company's seizure and holding of the 1631 copies. That Crooke could have had a copy, or copies, of the 1631 edition to submit for license should not strike us as strange, for Crooke had been first apprenticed to Allot, then employed by Allot, and finally became the manager of the Allot-Chetwin shop, and could easily have gotten many copies of the play. Richard Meighen's part in the venture is a little more doubtful, but it seems fairly clear that he was working in concert with Chetwin (the reference to the Company's refusal of his attempt to enter The Devil is an Ass in Downes' and Meade's Chancery answer shows this: Chas. I C19/23, Document II), who, being prevented from publishing under his own name, may simply have used Meighen as front man. However, by 1653 Chetwin was able to issue works with his name appearing in the imprint and he continued publishing openly until his death. The remainder of Jonson's works which had not been collected in either I F1 or II F1 were published in folio in 1641 (III F1), probably by Thomas Walkley. There is no indication that Walkley was connected with any of the persons responsible for any of the other folios, and there is documentary evidence that he was in direct conflict with the combine of Crooke and Benson. 14 However, Walkley's publication, if indeed it is his, was clearly timed to capitalize on the appearance of I F2 and II F2 in 1640 and 1641. This was so successful that some of the oversupply of copies of The Devil is an Ass found their way, by whatever routes, into copies of III F1 (Greg, III, 1079-81). The omission of The Devil is an Ass from Crooke and Legatt's transfer entry of 1637 had the ultimate effect of dissolving II F2 as a textual unit. By 1658 Walkley had not only successfully asserted his rights to all the works which appeared in III F1 but he had also gotten the rights to The Devil is an Ass , and the total contents of II F2 were now owned by Walkley and Crooke and Legatt, and the former publisher was in an open legal combat with the latter two. Walkley apparently made good his claims, for he entered on 17 September 1658 the entire contents of volume III of Jonson's works and The Devil is an Ass . On 20 November 1658 Walkley sold and transferred all the works he had entered on the preceding 17 September to Humphrey Moseley. Moseley continued to sell off the stock of III F1 during the 1650s and 1660s, and Andrew Crooke continued to sell the remaining stock of I and II F2 (Greg, III, 1082). No matter what the advertisements of these two may seem to imply, no further printing of any of the three volumes of Jonson's works occurred. In 1667 Moseley's widow sold the rights to the third volume to Henry Herringman. Herringman also must have obtained Crooke's rights to volumes I and II, though no evidence of the transfer has been preserved, for in 1692 Herringman published the first complete collected edition of Jonson's works (F3). However, by 1692 II F2 had been totally obliterated for the title-page reads: "THE | WORKS | OF | BEN JONSON, | Which were formerly Printed in Two Volumes, | are now Reprinted in One. | To which is added | A COMEDY, | CALLED THE | NEW INN." It seems clear that the two volumes referred to are the first and third volumes, and the second volume, which had been issued in various states and at various times for almost sixty years, which had been divided in ownership, and of which excess copies of one-third of it had been printed, simply was forgotten by succeeding publishers. Herringman must have thought of Bartholomew Fair and The Staple of News as being part of volume one and The Devil is an Ass as being part of the third ("second") volume. This rather complicated textual history may be displayed graphically as follows: The chart above indicates the peculiar situation of The Devil is an Ass in the textual tradition and further indicates that the texts of the greatest authority are, no matter the confusion, litigation, and peculiarities, just those we would expect, the first folio editions of each "volume." However, the history of the Jonson folios also demonstrates two other principles which, although they are not new to bibliographical study, have seldom been documented to this extent. The first principle is that often behind apparently clear and innocent transfer entries in the Stationers' Register lie complex and uncertain provisos, trust agreements, "Articles," and the like, and that if any difficulties arose concerning these arrangements then there may well be a trail of legal disputes in the records of the Company and in the public records. The second principle is that the Company of Stationers was most vigorous in asserting its rights to govern the operation of the whole book trade. The disputes over the control of "volume II" are almost completely a matter of Crooke and Legatt, the proper stationers, versus Philip Chetwin, the improper Clothworker. It is worthy of note that in the Chancery cases this distinction between stationer and non-stationer is not only brought out over and over, but is used by Crooke and the other defendants almost as a piece of evidence. Philip Chetwin, bellicose and litigious though he might be, was forced eventually to submit and fine for permission to engage in the book trade, and Walkley was very careful to "process" all his Jonson titles through the Register before selling them. As we have seen, even an insider like Crooke was forced into considerable difficulties because of his unfortunate failure properly to enter The Devil is an Ass .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Verses Address'd to the Imitator of Horace : A Skirmish between Pope and Some Persons of Rank and Fortune by Isobel Grundy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pope's imitations of Horace take as grist to their mill the attacks of those writers rash enough to oppose him. Mr. J. V. Guerinot, cataloguing their attempts, considers only one 'a worthy adversary' to Pope, which caught something of his 'own satiric brilliance'. 1 That one, the Verses Address'd to the Imitator of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace , 1733, has been briefly discussed not only by Guerinot but also by Professor Robert Halsband in his lives of its confederate authors, Lord Hervey and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Much, however, remains to be told, particularly about the poem's publishing history. This article will give a short account of Lady Mary's previous attacks on Pope, of her denial of any connection with the Verses and Hervey's silence about them; it will then recount the ascertainable facts about their publication, in two different texts, compare later printed versions of these texts and Hervey's unpublished revisions, analyse the evidence we have about authorship from contemporary and later opinion and from examination of the Verses themselves, and show the part which they later played in shaping some of Pope's own most brilliant attacking lines. Pope published his First Satire of the Second Book of Horace , Imitated , on 15 Feb. 1733. He devoted some attention (lines 81-84) to his former friend Lady Mary, who had already crossed pens with him: Slander or Poyson, dread from Delia 's Rage, Hard Words or Hanging, if your Judge be Page . From furious Sappho scarce a milder Fate, P-x'd by her Love, or libell'd by her Hate. Lord Hervey, who was politically opposed to Pope's friends, but had offered no show of hostility in print, 2 received only a glance of disparagement (lines 5-6): The Lines are weak, another's pleas'd to say, Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a Day. There was, however, a common element in the two attacks, in that each aimed at the victim's activities as a writer. Lady Mary tried nonliterary means to ensure Pope's future silence, first through Lord Peterborough and then through Sir Robert Walpole. 3 Her first attempt met with humiliating failure; while the second was still under discussion she must have turned back to the idea of verse retaliation. Despite its rashness and its liability to the charge from Pope of 'fulfilling the veracity of my prophecy', 4 this idea was not new to Lady Mary. After Pope's thrust in the Dunciad , 1728 (ii. 127-128): (Whence hapless Monsieur much complains at Paris Of wrongs from Duchesses and Lady Mary's), she had begun work on a mock-epic counterblast. Its action takes place before Queen Anne's death: Dullness, aided by Prophanation, Obscœnity and in an early version Cloacina, has settled (anachronistically) in a certain grotto beneath a muddy road: she plots to reverse the national educative process being carried out by Addison; each goddess supports her own candidate for leadership of their forces, and the young Pope is chosen as commander in preference to Swift, Gay, and Arbuthnot. 5 Lady Mary had re-worked the material of Pope's masterpiece and copied his tone with some skill. She had also enlisted her cousin Henry Fielding, at that time a very young writer looking for patronage, as ally. He too, loyally rather than personally indignant, had attacked the Dunciad in Dunciad -like fragments, related to hers, the draft of which he left with her. The subject-matter of this epic story makes it hard to see how either Fielding's or Lady Mary's part could ever have been finished, let alone printed. Any satisfaction which she derived from this counter-attack must have remained private. 6 After Pope's new offensive of 1733, Fielding composed his sympathetic 'Epistle to Mr Lyttleton, occasioned by two Lines in Mr Pope's Paraphrase on the first Satire of the 2d Book of Horace', either at Lady Mary's prompting or on his own initiative. Again he left the manuscript with her; again it remained unpublished. Meanwhile, however, as contemporary opinions about the Verses to the Imitator suggest, Lady Mary struck up the same sort of alliance with Lord Hervey that she had previously had with Fielding. No record of this remains among her letters: the following account comes from other sources than herself. She denied any part in the Verses , saying two years later that they had been written '(without my knowledge) by a Gentleman of great merit, whom I very much esteem, who [Pope] will never guess, and who, if he did know, he durst not attack'. This denial, sent to Arbuthnot the day after the publication of Pope's Epistle to him, can be ignored as a desperate defensive stroke in her mortal combat with Pope. If it is incredible, so are Pope's denials to Peterborough and to Hervey: that he 'never applied that name [Sappho] to her in any verse of mine, public or private; and, I firmly believe, not in any letter or conversation.' 7 Neither of the two enemies could be trusted to speak truth of the other. Lady Mary cannot be proved a liar. As her biographer writes, 'no documentary evidence survives to prove [her] authorship of the Verses '. 8 No copy in her hand is now known, either in the Harrowby Manuscripts Trust with the bulk of her papers, or elsewhere. Her great-grandson and editor, Lord Wharncliffe, claimed that the poem was 'contained in the collection of poems verified by Lady Mary's own hand as written by her'; and this was repeated by a later editor and a biographer. 9 Yet the surviving album verified by Lady Mary in this way, Harrowby MS 256, shows no sign of anything having been removed from it. Either a copy of the Verses was once lodged, though not bound, in the album, and has since vanished; or a whole volume of Lady Mary's manuscripts, also verified by her hand, has similarly disappeared; or Lord Wharncliffe was entirely mistaken. Hervey also says nothing of the poem in his surviving letters (which do not, however, include those he wrote to Lady Mary); but he is linked with it by documentary evidence, which will be discussed in detail later. He made two sets of corrections, differing slightly from each other: to a scribal copy now in the British Museum and to a printed copy now at Ickworth, Suffolk. He also wrote a manuscript preface ' To the Reader ', assuming rather than claiming authorship, now bound inside the Ickworth copy which he called 'corrected by the Author'; it is the closest we have to an assertion of literary ownership. He refrained from asserting the same thing elsewhere. He mentioned The First Satire of the Second Book without annoyance two days after its publication. Early in 1734, à propos his Epistle From a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity , he told Arbuthnot he was sorry 'to enter into a Paper-War' with Pope, apparently not expecting Arbuthnot to reply that he had entered already. 10 In letters he gloried in his severity on Pope, but only the severity of An Epistle , which he disclaimed in the press and discussed at length with his correspondents. 11 Where Lady Mary protests too much, Hervey protests less than might be expected. The Verses ' manner of publication does not cast much light on the question of authorship. Pope thought that Hervey had arranged it ('if I call it yours, my Lord, it is only because, whoever got it, you brought it forth'), and that he had recommended the poem to the perusal of the King and Queen. 12 But the bringing forth of the attack is even more obscure than its begetting. Hervey's preface and alterations indicate a concern with publication, not of any of the existing editions, but of a projected version which was never realised. The versions which were printed may have been authorized by him, by Lady Mary, by both, or by neither. They appeared through the publishers or pamphlet-distributors Anne Dodd and James Roberts respectively. The former edition was advertised as 'This Day' published in The London Evening-Post , 8 March 1733, with the additional selling-points of ' Being the same Size with the Dialogue [Pope's satire]' and 'By a Lady of Quality'. Its title ran: VERSES | Address'd to the | IMITATOR | of the | FIRST SATIRE | of the | Second Book of HORACE. | [rule] | By a Lady. | [rule: ornament] | LONDON: | Printed for A. Dodd, and sold at all the Pamphlet-Shops in Town. | ( Price Six-pence .) 13 The Roberts edition, rarer now than the Dodd one, was also advertised as 'This Day' published on 8 March 1733, in The Whitehall Evening-Post . Its price too was 6d. It made no mention of any author. Its title ran: to the | IMITATOR | of the | SATIRE | of the | Second Book of HORACE . | [ornament] | LONDON: | Printed for J. Roberts, near the Oxford-Arms in Warwick-Lane . | [short rule] | M.dcc.xxxiii. 14 The failure to identify the satire being answered was corrected by Hervey in his copy now at Ickworth. The edition was re-advertised, still as 'This Day' published, in The Daily Post-Boy of 9 March, which is also the date given the poem in The Grub-Street Journal . After this second advertisement hostilities broke out between Dodd, or rather her employer, and Roberts, or his. The Dodd side prosecuted the struggle with greater energy. On 10 March, and again on the 13th and 15th, The London Evening-Post reiterated that her version was 'This Day' published, pointed out that it was not only the same size as but ' very proper to be bound up with ' Pope's poem (the same applied, of course, to the Roberts edition, another folio), and added N.B. The Publick are desired to observe the Verses has the above title; and the Words, By a Lady and printed for A. Dodd, be in the Title Page; for there is a spurious and piratical Edition of these Verses abroad, printed from a very bad Copy. 15 On the 13th the Whitehall Evening-Post responded by reprinting its former advertisement for the Roberts edition, with the additional comment, 'N.B. This being the Genuine and Correct Edition, is in Three Sheets.' On 20 March, the day on which a revised edition was published through Dodd, and on 22 March, her London Evening-Post advertisement was altered to read ' stitch'd ' for ' bound ', and expanded to take in a quotation from Juvenal (' Si Natura negat, facit Indignatio Versus . Juv.') and to conclude: In that spurious Edition in three Sheets (one of which is only the Title) the Motto, and one whole Couplet in Page 5, are omitted; besides many notorious Blunders, and literal Errors. On 27 and 29 March this elaborated advertisement even appeared with its grammar corrected. On 31 March it was dropped from the London Evening-Post but re-appeared in the St. James's Evening Post . For three weeks the Dodd sales campaign had been running strongly. As the Dodd campaign reached its peak there appeared a new but related advertisement, as 'This Day' published, for 'An Elegy to a young Lady: In the Manner of Ovid. By ---- [James Hammond] With an Answer, by a Lady, Author of the Verses to the Imitator of Horace . Printed for J. Roberts . . . .' 16 With the publication through Roberts of these two poems, somebody using his imprint had admitted Lady Mary's authorship and the Dodd form of the title of the Verses to the Imitator . The Dodd edition's claim to superiority began to appear convincing. During this paper skirmish between the employers of the two pamphlet houses, the Dodd version underwent some changes. Its first edition exists in two different states: that already noted, and another in which the first line has a different ornamental 'I'. Resetting has occurred in sheet A and in the outer forme of B (page 8 only), but without verbal change. 17 More substantial changes are found in an edition published through Dodd on 20 March. 18 The collation is unchanged. ' Si Natura negat , facit Indignatio versus . Juvenal.' has been added to the title page (in contrast with the revisions made by Hervey and discussed below: he wrote a title page which invoked Horace instead of Juvenal). An extra couplet appears at lines 38-39 and verbal changes at lines 28, 73-74 and 80. The ornamental 'I' is the same as in the second state of the first edition; the text appears to have been reset only as far as necessary to accommodate the extra couplet. There are one or two changes in punctuation—little enough to form a basis for the fighting words of the expanded advertisement. 19 The Dodd edition must have sold out again before 16 Jan. 1735, when there issued through her shop 'The Fifth Edition Corrected', handsomely advertised in the London Evening-Post (16, 18, 21 and 23 Jan.) as 'by a Lady', as ' Proper to bind with ' Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot and 'other Pieces in Folio', and sold by Dodd, J. Fisher and 'most Pamphlet Shops in Town'. Lord Oxford commented on his copy: This wch is called the fifth edition is not true but a sham of the Booksellers upon Mr Pope's printing his Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot where these verses are mentiond they supposed that some copies would be called for. 20 If Oxford thought that Dodd or her employer was unloading old stock, he was wrong: in the 'Fifth Edition' the tailpiece ornament as well as the title-page one was changed, the same initial 'I' employed as in the original text of 8 March 1733 (not used since the first state), and both sheets were entirely re-set. The collation was unchanged. A variant was introduced in line 77, and line 20 was italicized to go with a footnote, which with another on p. 6 referred to Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot . 21 There is no evidence here of authorial revision. The commanders had remained indistinguishable during the competition between the mercenaries Dodd and Roberts, who were accustomed to serving as screens for the operations of others. Both were 'publishers', to be defined as those who distribute books or pamphlets without other responsibility, not owning the copyright, employing the printer, or even knowing the writer. Their imprint and their names in advertisements provide no evidence of authorship, and indeed were intended to conceal it. 22 Anne Dodd (d. c . 1750) was a friend and associate of the notorious Curll; she sold many of the post- Dunciad attacks on Pope, as well as the First Satire of the Second Book itself, and also the Opposition journal The Craftsman . 23 James Roberts (d. 1754) carried pamphlets mainly for the other side, that of the government. He was in fact Hervey's usual outlet for his anonymous writings in support of Walpole. 24 Lady Mary had had experience of both these pamphlet-sellers: Roberts's name had appeared on the title-page of her Court Poems , pirated by Curll in 1716, and (together with that of Anne Dodd) on her Genuine Copy of a Letter Written From Constantinople by an English Lady , 1719, published through the indiscretion or even greed of her friend the Abbé Conti. On these occasions she did not, like Hervey, use the printing trade, but was used by it. These transactions would not have endeared either Roberts or Dodd to her; but she did employ Roberts on two occasions, one before and one after the publication of the Verses : as an agent in 1727 when advertising for her runaway son, and as distributor in 1737-38 for her anonymous journal in support of Walpole, The Nonsense of Common-Sense . 25 The fact that both the putative authors had links with Roberts diminishes the temptation to link one text of the Verses with each. It also makes more surprising the apparent superiority of the Dodd version—an indisputable superiority in vigour of marketing, reprinting, and revising the text, even though no firm judgement can be made about its original accuracy. The Dodd ascription 'By a Lady' might seem to connect this text with Lady Mary; but this publicity would probably, judging from her usual comments on the horror of appearing in print, have been unwelcome to her. It is possible that the Verses got printed only through the unreliability of someone who saw them in manuscript (as in the case of Lady Mary's involuntary publications of 1716 and 1719). The two original printed texts, apparently published on the same day, 26 are in fact very much alike. Apart from the title there are only four minor variants (line 7, 'view' in Dodd, 'views' in Roberts; line 55, 'He' in Dodd, 'He'd' in Roberts; line 89, 'do' in Dodd, 'then' in Roberts; line 96, 'priz'd' in Dodd, 'prais'd' in Roberts). In each case it is arguable which reading is better, except perhaps the last, where Dodd appears to carry it. From the beginning there were slender grounds for the Dodd advertisements to call the Roberts text ' spurious '. 27 Both versions omit lines 38-39, an unremarkable couplet which was added in the second Dodd edition, 20 March: Nor Dignity nor Innocence is spar'd, Nor Age, nor Sex, nor Thrones, nor Graves rever'd. It resembles one in an unpublished poem by Hervey: Horrid Confusion! Age nor Sex is spared; Nor Royal Heads, nor ev'n their Gods rever'd. 28 The only surviving manuscript of the Verses to lack lines 38-39 is one in the collection begun in childhood at the instigation of her father by the Duchess of Portland, daughter of an old friend of Lady Mary, and headed 'by Ly Ma-y W—ly Describ'd by the Name Sappho'; 29 it could therefore be related to her own holograph (which if so was closer to the Roberts than the Dodd text). Hervey's scribal copy contained the couplet; he inserted it in his printed copy. It probably derived from him and was left out of the first printed texts by oversight. Three other changes made in the Dodd edition of 20 March perhaps stem from Lady Mary since they were not made by Hervey in his copies. In line 28 the substitution of 'to' for 'of' converts 'Abuse' from noun to verb, making it a better rhyme for 'news' and 'Stews'. In lines 73-74 ' Porcupines . . . Backs shoot' becomes ' Porcupine . . . Back shoots', which removes the absurdity of plural porcupines shooting forth a single quill. In line 80 ' little ' becomes ' puny ', a more accurate quotation from Pope, whose Epistle to Burlington is here being turned against himself. These have the air of authorial or at least careful revisions; they seem not to be corrections of printer's slips, for the awkwardnesses which they remove are common to all contemporary manuscripts of the Verses , including Hervey's. The text of 20 March, like those of the 8th, has possible links with each collaborator. 30 The four surviving contemporary manuscripts bear no obvious relation to print. The Duchess of Portland's copy agrees with the Roberts against the Dodd text everywhere except line 96, lacks the extra couplet, and embodies four minor variants which are neither clearly improvements nor clearly corruptions. James West (d. 1772), resident at the Inner Temple when the poem was published, kept a copy titled as by Lady Mary (Bod. MS Eng. misc. c. 399, ff. 76-77), which generally agrees with the first Dodd text, but includes the extra couplet; it omits lines 36-37 and 89-90, and includes seven variants which may well be mere slips. Another copy (BM Add. MS 31152, ff. 25-26) mentions no author's name; it has the extra couplet but otherwise agrees with the first Dodd text, and with Dodd at lines 55 and 96 but with Roberts at lines 7 and 89. It has eight other variants (or slips). These copies show that, brief as was the period between the composition of the Verses and their printing, they circulated before publication or independently of it, in forms which combined features of both published texts (but none of the 20th March Dodd revisions, except sometimes the extra couplet). Hervey's untitled scribal transcript of the Verses (BM Add. MS 35335, a volume of material collected by Horace Walpole, ff. 53-54), in which he made one set of his alterations, agrees with the Roberts edition except at lines 38-39 and line 96. If it derived from his holograph, then that would have been a little nearer to Roberts than to Dodd. It did not, however, reflect his final wishes. He deleted lines 9-10, where the Roberts text demands whether Pope can no better understand That Spirit he pretends to imitate Than heretofore that Greek he did translate? This he replaced with the more explicit Horace than Homer? or was less to seek, In Latin Spirit than in verbal Greek? For this like that thou shoudst have ask'd Broome's Aid, Who writes that Verse for which great Pope is pay'd, Broome would have told thee and have told thee true That whilst the Paths of Horace you pursue . . . He also crossed out lines 40-43: Nor only Justice vainly we demand, But even Benefits can't rein thy Hand. To this or that alike in vain we trust, Nor find thee less ungrateful than unjust. These followed a reference to Pope's supposed attack on James Brydges, Duke of Chandos, in his Epistle to Burlington ; the printed texts carried an explanatory footnote which Hervey's scribal manuscript duplicates. His deletion perhaps reflected unwillingness to stress Chandos's kindness to Pope. He also deleted the echo of the Epistle to Burlington at lines 79-82 of the Verses : Who but must laugh this Bully when he sees A little Insect shiv'ring at a Breeze ? One over-match'd by ev'ry Blast of Wind, Insulting and provoking all Mankind. Yet he did not wish to avoid all specific reference to the Epistle , for the added to the Verses , line 90, a note, 'See Taste and Riches'. These revisions may have been made either before or after publication. They probably but not necessarily preceded Hervey's other set of revisions, made either immediately upon publication, or later. One possible occasion is January 1734, in which month he wrote of making additions and corrections to his Epistle From a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity (published Nov. 1733, also attacking Pope), although he was 'tired of hearing, seeing &amp; talking of these odious verses'. 31 The corrections referred to are probably those surviving in a copy of his Epistle which is now bound up with his revised printed copy of the Verses at Ickworth. He could have revised both together as part of the same anti-Pope campaign. Working with a copy of the Roberts edition which he then called 'corrected by the Author', Hervey gave no hint that he had approved its text; indeed, two of his changes bring it closer to Dodd. His alterations do not correspond exactly with those he made to the scribal copy. He deleted the same lines 9-10, but here he wrote in only the first four lines of his six-line insertion, and proposed moving the succeeding paragraph to follow line 24. Here too he deleted lines 40-43, but in this case only 81-82, not 79-82. Here too he inserted the note at line 90. He brought the Roberts text into conformity with that of Dodd at lines 55 and 96, but did not alter lines 7 and 89 (the change at line 55 was one which he could have made in his manuscript copy, but did not). He also made some entirely different revisions: line 8, 'mean' for 'dull'; line 58, 'that Sentence' for 'the Sentence'; line 102, 'When left forlorn' for 'That leaves Thee thus'; line 105, 'Whilst then' for 'Then whilst'; and lines 99-100, Or thy late Works for Dormitives shall keep, And to thy Taste and Riches nightly sleep for And to thy Books shall ope their Eyes no more, Than to thy Person they wou'd do their Door. Many of his revisions, both to manuscript and printed copy, must be the result of second thoughts (or of disagreement with a co-author), not, like those made in the Dodd second edition, corrections of clumsiness. Hervey's holograph ' To the Reader ', probably but not necessarily composed at the same date as his revisions to the printed copy, survives on a separate sheet of paper now bound into that copy before the title page. It runs thus, with his own footnotes: 32 So hasty and incorrect a Copy of these Verses was first sent into the World, and one so much more imperfect is since printed, that I can not help indulging my Vanity so far, since they are to appear in Publick, as to set them forth in their best Dress. And whilst I endeavour to do poetical Justice to the Composition I must take the same Opportunity to do moral Justice to the Design, especially since the Generality of the World has been so malicious as to insinua[te] that there is any thing in this Performance that carrys a Reflexion on the celebrated Mr. Pope , for whom I have always had the greate[st] and justest Regard. I am less surprised at the Ill-nature shown to me by this Insinuation, as it is so conformable to That practised towards Mr Pope him-self, when the monstrous Injustice of his censorious Readers endeavour'd to fix such names to Characters of his drawing, as I dare swear no more enter'd into his Head on that Occasion, than his did into mine upon this . As I have follow'd Mr Pope's† Example in this publick Profession of my Innocence, I hope I shall also have his good fortune in recieving Absolution; and that He and all Mankind must allow my* Apology to be as good as his, tho not my Verses. †See the Preface to the second Edition of Taste an Epistle. *See the same. This protective irony is designed to lend confusion rather than clarification; it is not inconsistent with a possible desire to conceal a partner. Despite Hervey's explicit reference to the Epistle to Burlington , his remark about Pope's disingenuous response to identification of his characters may glance at Sappho as well as Timon. His account of the publication of the Verses —'So hasty and incorrect a Copy' circulating in 'the World' and followed by a version 'much more imperfect since printed'—is probably a comparison of manuscript copies with one or both of the printed versions, rather than of any printed text with another. In any case Hervey, as he worked on the Verses after their publication, clearly had an eye on the press. In the text he indicated heavy typographical emphasis; on the back of his preface he drafted a title page which he later struck through: A Genuine Copy | Of the Verses adress'd to the Imitator of the first Satire | of the second Book | of Horace. | with a Preface to the Reader. | [double rule] | Publish'd by the Author. | [rule] | —omnes | Vicini oderunt, noti, Pueri, atque Puellæ. | Miraris?—Hor: | [rule] On the printed title page he added the same quotation from Horace, inserted 'first' before 'SATIRE', and below the printer's ornament 'the second Edition corrected | by the Author, with a Preface.' To sum up the testimony of the editions and manuscripts: Hervey treated the Verses as his own property to preface and revise; he gave little sign of knowledge of the Dodd text of 8 March and none of that of 20 March; he disapproved of the Roberts text, though he owned it because it was convenient for him to obtain from his usual agent; he sounded fairly convincingly the familiar note of an author who has been surreptitiously published; and he projected at some unknown date a new edition which came to nothing. Lady Mary on the contrary publicly denied the Verses and left no evidence connecting them with her. Between 8 and 20 March 1733 somebody read the Dodd text carefully enough to notice one omission and three blemishes, and got them altered; nobody bothered to alter these same blemishes, or the more glaringly wrong title page, in the Roberts edition. The Dodd edition probably sold better from the beginning, if the second state represents an intermediate re-printing before the second edition, either because of its advertising or its ascription 'By a Lady' or for some other unknown reason. After publishing history, the next possible source for evidence of authorship is contemporary and later critical opinion. The Verses seem to have been identified as Lady Mary's from the first, and Hervey's contribution recognized only later. Two of the four early transcripts ascribed them to her. On 8 March, the day of publication, Pope wrote to Fortescue of 'that Lady's having taken her own Satisfaction in an avowed Libell'; this sounds more sincere than his later suggestion that he considered the Dodd title-page ascription, 'By a Lady', to be her deliberate confession of authorship. 33 Two days later Theobald told Warburton that Pope had been 'most handsomely depicted in a severe Poem by Lady Mary W. Mountague'. 34 On [18] March Pope again wrote of the 'Libel' as hers alone; he did not link Hervey's name with hers until 2[0] April. Irish opinion also believed the Verses were 'certainly hers'. 35 Her authorship was again assumed three weeks after publication by whoever was responsible for printing the Answer to Hammond's Elegy as 'By a lady, Author of the Verses to the Imitator of Horace.' (Dodsley's Collection , however, reprinting the Answer as Hervey's, thereby implied his authorship of the Verses too.) 36 Hervey himself kept a copy of the Elegy and Answer (now bound with his copy of the Verses at Ickworth), but he made no mark in it as he did in the other pamphlets collected in this volume as his. Hostile squadrons gathering against the Verses had no doubt whom to attack. A Proper Reply to a Lady , 'By a Gentleman' (3 April), began with the question of authorship: What Lust of Malice, what salacious Spite 'Gainst her Alcaeus Sappho moves to write? It must be Sappho .—Who can chuse but guess Whence springs this clam'rous Womanish Address? This 'Gentleman' not only detected feminine ignorance of razors in lines 25-26, but amply hinted at Lady Mary's identity, mentioning her poetry and the scandal over her deranged sister. Another combatant, the 'Gentlewoman' who printed at her own expense her Advice to Sappho (received by Lord Oxford on 12 April), 37 made it clear that her quarry was Lady Mary. On the other side, the anonymous author of 'In Defence of Lady Mary Wortley' described how 'Ingenious Wortley draws her conq'ring Pen.' 38 By 2[0] April Pope had heard more of the complicated story of 'Lady M—'s or Lord H—'s performance. . . . it was labour'd, corrected, præcommended and post-disapprov'd, so far as to be dis-own'd by themselves, after each had highly cry'd it up for the others'. 39 On the first of May Swift wrote of the authors as 'they', not knowing whether 'the production you mention came from the Lady or the Lord'. In any case he was not impressed: I did not imagine that they were at least so bad versifyers, Therefore, facit indignation versum [ sic : he must have seen a copy of the second Dodd edition], is only to be applyed when the indignation is against general vilany, and never operates when a vilian writes to defend himself. I love to hear them reproach you for dulness; Onely I would be satisfied, since you are so dull, why are they so angry? 40 Thereafter, opinions continued uncertain or ambiguous—none more so than Pope's own in his Letter to a Noble Lord , 30 Nov. 1733. Here he began with a clear statement of Lady Mary's responsibility: 'I wonder yet more, how a lady, of great wit, beauty, and fame for her poetry . . . could be prevailed upon to take a part in that proceeding.' Further on he implied that her denial of authorship, brought to him by Lord Peterborough, had caused him to change his mind about her part in the Verses ; but this he almost immediately contradicted, in a passage famous for suggestiveness rather than for precision: Your Lordship indeed said you had it from a lady, and the lady said it was your Lordship's; some thought the beautiful bye-blow had two fathers, or (if one of them will hardly be allowed a man) two mothers; indeed I think both sexes had a share in it, but which was uppermost, I know not. I pretend not to determine the exact method of this witty fornication. 41 Pope never again admitted to believing Lady Mary's disclaimer. He continued to couple her with Hervey as authors of unworthy libels against him, either as ' some Persons of Rank and Fortune ' or by name. 42 By this time Hervey had struck again in his Epistle From a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity ; Pope did not make it clear whether he was blaming Hervey for that alone, or for a share with Lady Mary in the Verses . More than a year after the Verses were published, a third name was added to those of the suspected authors. Lord Oxford wrote on his copy of the first Dodd edition, 'The Authors of this poem are Lady Mary Wortley, Lord Harvey and Mr Windham under Tutor to the Duke of Cumberland and married to my Lady Deloraine'. 43 Since William Windham married Lady Delorain only in April 1734, Oxford's identification was written more than a year after the Verses were published—very likely at the same time that he annotated his copy of the 'Fifth Edition', January 1735. Despite this time-lag Windham is a plausible third collaborator. His courtship of Lady Delorain (the 'Delia' Pope linked with 'Sappho') provided ample grounds for reprisals by him. He might be the esteemed gentleman whom Lady Mary considered Pope would not guess or dare to attack—a description by that time entirely unfitted to Hervey, who had just been trounced as Sporus. A Letter to a Noble Lord mentions 'your friend W----m '. Professor Maynard Mack has argued that Windham's marriage and his part in the Verses are glanced at in the Epistle to Arbuthnot : To please a Mistress , One aspers'd his life; He lash'd him not, but let her be his Wife . 44 Lord Oxford may have been simply following this same reasoning, or he may have had positive information. His wife was a close friend of Lady Mary, and their daughter the Duchess of Portland (whose transcript of the Verses , ascribed to Lady Mary, has already been mentioned) an equally close friend of Lady Mary's daughter. The paragraph in the Verses beginning Not even Youth and Beauty can controul The universal Rancour of thy Soul was taken by W. J. Courthope to be a tribute to Lady Mary, 45 but is more appropriate to Lady Delorain, who was eleven years younger. These lines, if no others in the Verses , may well be Windham's contribution. If he took a larger part, it seems odd that it attracted such slight and tardy notice. Later attributions of the Verses followed one or other contemporary view. In 1768 Isaac Reed, editing Lady Mary's Poetical Works , reprinted them (pp. 46-54) from the Monthly Review , 1767, without suggesting that she was not sole author. James Dallaway, first editor to be allowed by her family to use her papers, mentioned that the poem was 'said to have been the joint performance' of her and Hervey. 46 J. W. Croker, who edited Hervey's Memoirs , decided on the basis of the manuscript evidence that Hervey wrote it—but decided against his own critical judgement, for he found it smoother, keener, and in every way better than any of Lord Hervey's single-handed productions—except (if that be one) the ' Answer ' to Hammond. . . . a marked superiority over Lord Hervey's other works, both in vigour and polish— and especially over An Epistle From a Nobleman . 47 W. J. Courthope found in the poem various characteristics of Hervey (triplets, enjambement, lack of cæsura), but also 'greater vigour than is usually found in Lord Hervey's style, which, when he uses metre, is, as a rule, mean and dull.' 48 A modern critic finds An Epistle 'inferior to the Verses , lacking the crack and sparkle which frequently distinguish' them. 49 Halkett and Laing's Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature ascribes the Verses to Lady Mary (rev. ed., 1926-43). Hervey's most recent editor gives as 'the accepted view' that she wrote them, possibly with Hervey's help. 50 His biographer, wittily elaborating Pope's paradoxes, finds in the poem 'a crude vitality and masculine robustness more characteristic of Lady Mary . . . than it is of Hervey, most of whose verse is monotonously fluent and nerveless', and concludes it to be hers. 51 It still remains to analyse the poem more closely and to compare it in some detail with others by each writer. This analysis will confirm the view of Lady Mary's dominance, but with some qualifications. The opening of the Verses is strongly Herveyesque: antitheses as thick as bees o'er vernal blossoms, and six lines of subordinate clauses (in most of Lady Mary's poems the first main verb occurs in the first or second line). On the other hand the extended climactic image occupying the last paragraph has many parallels among her verse, while Hervey usually prefers to end with a detached, pointed couplet. If genuine collaboration went into the Verses , then the influence of each contributor enabled the other to surpass his or her usual level. They have none of the prolixity which was Hervey's besetting sin, and little of the careless syntax and construction which was Lady Mary's. She seldom uses 'thou' and 'thee' with so few lapses into 'you'. The balance of lines and couplets (especially in the series of antitheses at lines 93-100) is more exactly judged than is usual in any but short passages of her writing. Hervey was certainly no fonder of triplets than she was; but while his generally enclose their sense within the three lines in the approved manner, she treated this device in more cavalier fashion, often making the third line introduce a new idea or lead hurriedly on towards the following couplet, as it does in all the triplets of the Verses except the first. In content the poem reflects sometimes one author, sometimes the other. The sneer at Pope's classicism in the first paragraph expresses an attitude which Hervey (like Fielding) consistently took towards him: that of one who has enjoyed the classical education proper to a gentleman. In his revisions to the Verses and also in later attacks, Hervey accuses Pope of inability to appreciate the ancients; in An Epistle From a Nobleman he laments the increasing rustiness of his own classical learning, with a polite air of deprecating a grace which in fact his correspondent knows him to possess. This poem, like the Verses (line 4), compares Pope to his disadvantage with the 'ancient Sense' which Hervey felt himself better equipped to savour. The Verses's admission (line 96) that many people had formerly prized Pope's work possibly reflects the fact that Lady Mary, who never liked his satires, had once deeply admired his pre- Dunciad poems. By 1728 she had lost her admiration sufficiently to call them 'smooth unmeaning Rhime'; perhaps a contrast with that smoothness is implied in the Verses , line 19: 'none thy crabbed Numbers can endure'. Hervey made no distinctions as to chronology when attacking Pope's work. The reference ( Verses , line 61) to physical weakness as 'The Female Scold's Protection in Offence' would read oddly coming from Lady Mary. So would the gibe at Pope as one who may legitimately be beaten since he 'cannot fight' (line 62), which may imply a contrast with Hervey's surprisingly bold conduct in his duel with Pulteney in 1731. The threat of inflicting punishment is in itself harder to assign; there are innumerable parallels in other people's pamphlet attacks on Pope, and some elsewhere in Hervey's and Lady Mary's writings. Hervey had mentioned late in December 1731, and again in January 1733, the likelihood of physical chastisement for Pope: on the first occasion he seems to have been quoting a phrase of Lady Mary's, as reported by Horace Walpole; on the second he used, like the Verses , line 65, the word 'cudgel'. 52 This passage goes on to depict Pope escaping actual punishment ('Limbs unbroken, Skin without a Stain, | Unwhipt, unblanketed, unkick'd, unslain'), as does the concluding line of Lady Mary's 'P[ope] to Bolingbroke', written after An Essay on Man : 'You scape the Block, and I the Whipping-Post'. 53 The effect in both poems is that of a barely-suppressed rather than a direct threat. The Verses contain no unique accusations, only those repeated elsewhere by Hervey, Lady Mary, Fielding, and others. Yet some distinctions may be drawn. Pope wrote of the Verses : 'Tis a pleasure &amp; a comfort at once to find, that with so much mind, as so much Malice must have to accuse or blacken my character, it can fix upon no one ill or immoral thing in my Life; &amp; must content itself to say my Poetry is dull, &amp; my Person ugly. 54 Insofar as this is accurate, it suggests a contrast with Lady Mary's other verse attacks on him, which fix on a large number of specific if unjust moral charges: superstition, obscenity, profaning religion, unfairness to Addison, Tickell, Lintot, Walpole, and Mme Dacier; toad-eating, cheating subscribers, causing bad blood between husband and wife, boasting of fictitious amatory exploits, and having the clap. 55 From the beginning, and increasingly with time, she points at Pope's personality rather than his writing, abusing his 'Father, Mother, Body, Soul' as well as 'Muse' 56 with more inclusiveness and particularity than Hervey. Oddly, in view of the latter's career, her attacks outside the Verses are more politically angled than his; they present Pope linked with Bolingbroke and others, a poison working in the body of the state, while Hervey presents him as an obscure private lampooner. Hervey also moves away from the literary towards the personal in his attacks, but never becomes so specific in his personalities as Lady Mary. His Epistle From a Nobleman , devoting only part of its space to attacking Pope, singles out poor translation and plagiarism. His prose Letter to Mr. C-b-r , 1742, reproves Cibber for attacking 'nothing but his Morals, which no body defends', and goes on to criticise his poetry. The Difference between Verbal and Practical Virtue , published a few days later, says that Pope should be castigated for 'that worse Deformity, his Mind', mentioning specifically literary faults as well as vindictiveness, lying, and ingratitude. Of the major ideas of the Verses , that of Pope as inhuman is more characteristic of Lady Mary; that of his verse as unintentionally innocuous is more like Hervey. In their plan the Verses differ from Lady Mary's other poetic attacks. Those are all cast in dramatic form, involving more than one character (Dullness, her 'subservient Pow'rs', and the Scriblerians; Swift and a prostitute; Pope and Bolingbroke), 57 whereas Hervey always chooses to argue directly in his own person, like an orator speaking for the prosecution. The Verses come closer to his method, though the fact that they are addressed to Pope, like an epistle, gives them greater immediacy of attack than an address to a third party, and they are not without dramatic characterization. Hervey undoubtedly made use of the Verses' second paragraph, Thine is just such an Image of his Pen, As thou thy self art of the Sons of Men: Where our own Species in Burlesque we trace, A Sign-Post Likeness of the noble Race; That is at once Resemblance and Disgrace, nine years later in The Difference Between Verbal and Practical Virtue : But whilst such Features in his Works we trace, And Gifts like these his happy Genius grace. . . . It seems the Counterpart by Heav'n design'd A Symbol and a Warning to Mankind: As at some Door we find hung out a Sign, Type of the Monster to be found within. But the image of Pope's body as sign and type of his mind weakens the fearsome image of his body as a signpainter's travesty of a man. Later and inferior re-workings are not evidence either for or against authorship; but it is of some interest that Hervey's The Difference re-works many ideas from the Verses and weakens almost all of them. For instance, it reduces to a run-of-the-mill accusation of impotence the force of 'the gross Lust of Hate' ( Verses , line 30) and 'No more for loving made, then to be lov'd' ( Verses , line 49), and in making a statement of the suitability of Pope's mind to his body misses half the point of Verses , lines 50-51: It was the Equity of righteous Heav'n, That such a Soul to such a Form was giv'n. These details add up to a real and important difference between the pictures which the two poems present. The Difference takes the form of a general essay on the failure of poets to practise what they preach: Pope, though likened to a monster, to Domitian, to 'some yelping Mungril', remains recognisably an actual writer, who has faults which Horace, Seneca and others had, only worse. Despite the shrill tone which is de rigueur among Pope's antagonists, it remains a rational argument, as does that part of An Epistle From a Nobleman which deals with Pope. (Hervey points out in An Epistle that Pope has mangled 'what Homer thought', which is a derogatory opinion; Lady Mary in 'P[ope] to Bolingbroke' makes him refer casually to himself as 'The Homer, and the Horace of the Age', which is a dramatization. 58 ) Though the Verses do not, like other works by Lady Mary, present Pope as a developed fictional character, they go further than Hervey's in transforming the raw material which he represents. The first paragraph of the Verses , perhaps Hervey's, is entirely logical if one accepts its premises. Thereafter, non-rational suggestion takes over. The images of the poem cluster round several central ideas: that of Pope as non-human, which the sign-post image introduces; that of his works as instruments of hurt, a whole catalogue of which succeed each other between lines 21 and 37, and 73 and 88; that of unavailing effort in 'Weeds, as they are, they seem produc'd by Toil', 'doubly bent to force a Dart', the lines on beauty, 'rancorous Will', 'stings and dies' and 'try at least t'assassinate' (all of which assert the opposite of Pope's own claim to Horatian ease); and that of oneman warfare against the rest of mankind. This idea dominates the poem, steadily growing in importance and incidentally producing some fine lines ('The Object of thy Spleen is Human Kind', line 33; 'To Thee 'tis Provocation to exist', line 35). As an enemy to mankind (and first of all to women), Pope is linked with Milton's Satan in his later, ignoble stages. Whether snake, porcupine or wasp, he is something the surrounding human beings look at with wonder and contempt. 59 At last he becomes the outcast homicide Cain. One can see how indispensable to the design is the most offensive aspect of the poem, the use it makes (from the second paragraph to the last couplet) of Pope's deformity. 60 Whether or not it is true, as J. V. Guerinot thinks, that 'the experience of years of friendship, possibly of love . . . made it possible for Lady Mary to wound deepest of all', 61 it is true that the Verses inflict some wounds which are almost caressing. There is insulting pity in 'thy poor Corps' (line 91), in 'wretched little Carcass' and 'angry little Monster' (lines 70 and 76), and in lines 81-82 (surely Lady Mary's, since Hervey struck them out in both his copies): One over-match'd by ev'ry Blast of Wind, Insulting and provoking all Mankind. This glimpse of embattled mock-pathos is vivid enough to oppose to self-portraits of the heroic satirist; yet despite hints of pathos or even amusement, the Pope created in the Verses is a creature whom in the end it is appropriate to banish with Old-Testament rigour. The Verses make comparatively little effort to take up points from the First Satire of the Second Book . One might expect Hervey to look for debating points, or Lady Mary to be provoked by its celebration of Pope's friends, 'Chiefs out of war, and statesmen out of place', since they were her habitual targets in polemical verse. But all is subordinated to the substitution of the imaginary pest for the real man or for the modest crusader depicted in the Satire . Where the Verses do allude to specific lines it is always on this point of self-portraiture. Their 'if thou drawst thy Pen to aid the Law' (line 64) refers to the Satire's passage, lines 105ff.: What? arm'd for Virtue when I point the Pen, Brand the bold Front of shameless, guilty Men. . . . The second of these two lines also suggested the image of Pope's deformity as the brand 'Mark'd on thy Back, like Cain , by God's own Hand'. Line 84, ' To make those tremble who escape the Law ', paraphrases Pope's claim in his line 118. Immediately afterwards, lines 85-86, Is this Ridicule to live so long, The deathless Satire , and immortal Song ? refer to Pope's seeing the victim of his satire in his lines 79-80: Sacred to Ridicule! his whole Life long, And the sad Burthen of some merry Song. This distorts Pope's claim by over-stating it and ignoring its irony and humour. Pope surpassed his attackers in turning their weapons back upon themselves. Five years later he took 'But Horace , Sir, was delicate, was nice' 62 from the Verses , line 16: ' Horace can laugh, is delicate, is clear'. He may also have recalled 'none thy crabbed Numbers can endure' (line 19) when he wrote in the Epistle to Arbuthnot that ' Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my Lays' (line 138). But of all his re-workings of the lines of others against him, laying them low with words from their own mouths, the most striking is the Sporus portrait ( Arbuthnot , lines 305-333), which can be seen as virtually a composite portrait of the two collaborators. In the Sporus passage the Verses seem to live a ghastly resurrected life. One of their accusations is re-animated in 'florid Impotence', one of their techniques alluded to in 'vile Antithesis'. Pope used their comparison of himself (line 55) with ' the Snake of Eve ' for 'at the Ear of Eve , familiar Toad'. 'This painted Child of Dirt that stinks and stings' has its source in 'as we're told of Wasps, it stings and dies' ( Verses , line 88). He was already fond of insect-imagery, but his identification of Sporus-Hervey with butterfly and bug acquires an extra force from the Verses ' use of this very image. Indeed, for readers—let alone the writers—of the Verses , an additional layer of meaning informs this passage. No wonder if on the publication of Pope's epistle someone 'supposed that some copies would be called for'. The poem had acquired notoriety as an assault on Pope of which 'Your Lordship indeed said you had it from a lady, and the lady said it was your Lordship's'. Although 'both sexes had a share in it', the lady, more sorely provoked and more poetically inventive, probably had the greater. Yet the lord was taking public acknowledgement and blame. The Sporus portrait, already rich with complex allusions to Hervey's sexual reputation, his influence on Queen Caroline, the behind-the-scenes nature of his court and pamphlet politics, acquires a new level of significance through the unacknowledged place in it of Lady Mary. Like Walpole she speaks through Hervey's mouth, like the Queen she is corrupted by him: as the Prompter breathes, the Puppet squeaks; Or at the Ear of Eve , familiar Toad, Half Froth, half Venom, spits himself abroad. . . . His Wit all see-saw between that and this , Now high, now low, now Master up, now Miss, And he himself one vile Antithesis. Amphibious Thing! that acting either Part . . . Now trips a Lady, and now struts a Lord. Eve 's Tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest, A Cherub's face, a Reptile all the rest. The sexual innuendoes of A Letter to a Noble Lord can be seen as a preliminary draft for this portrait, clumsy in comparison with the finished product. The authors of the Verses had put up a fierce fight, but the champion was not to be worsted. He gave Hervey what is probably the most memorable of all his satirical lashings; he allowed Lady Mary (like her own later imagined version of himself) to escape the public whipping-post. In private she was not exempt. Pope deflected the weighty blow of the Verses ' closing lines by skilful paraphrase: Sapho enrag'd crys out your Back is round, Adonis screams — Ah! Foe to all Mankind! 63 It appears that he was not blind to the element of insulting pity in the poem, for he took up that weapon and with that too proved himself the victor: Thanks, dirty Pair! you teach me what to say, When you attack my Morals, Sense, or Truth, I answer thus—poor Sapho you grow grey, And sweet Adonis—you have lost a Tooth. The annals of poetic warfare can hardly show a finer example of wounding, as the Verses have it (line 26), 'with a Touch, that's scarcely felt or seen.'</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Dating of the Two Hyperions by Leonidas M. Jones</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chief contention of this article, that Keats wrote the Induction to The Fall of Hyperion in September and October of 1817, is not new. Amy Lowell argued warmly and extensively for such a view, 1 and Claude Lee Finney continued to support the same position with arguments based solely on internal evidence. 2 But all recent major biographers of Keats—Hewlett, Bate, Ward, Bush, and Gittings 3 —have rejected that dating in favor of either late summer and fall of 1819 or fall and winter of 1819. It is fair to say that the later dating has been repeated so often from such respected authorities that it has hardened into a kind of conviction which is generally accepted as virtual fact. There are reasons to believe that it is wrong, and the case should be reopened. The Induction to The Fall of Hyperion is distinctly separable from the other version, Hyperion , unlike the remainder of The Fall , which is merely a recasting of passages from Hyperion . The dating of the Induction is vitally important for an understanding of Keats's poetic development because in the last three decades it has come to be regarded as one of Keats's masterpieces, valued comparably with the great odes and Lamia . The difference in the dating of somewhat less than a year which is at issue would probably matter little for poets with lengthy careers like Dryden and Tennyson, but for Keats that time period is almost one-fifth of the scant five years that he had to write, and of those five years the last is by far the most significant. Whether the Induction was the beginning or the culmination of the annus mirabilis is of the first importance. Since my argument for the earlier dating will require the unravelling of a complicated tangle of confusing evidence, it may be helpful at the outset to sketch the basic pattern as a preliminary guide. The Charlotte Reynolds transcript of The Fall of Hyperion furnishes evidence that Keats wrote the Induction in September and October of 1818. I shall contend that he first wrote the opening twenty-one lines of Hyperion before the Scottish tour in the summer of 1818, turned away from that start to begin afresh The Fall of Hyperion in September 1818, recast the first twenty-one lines of Hyperion as ll. 294-326 of The Fall , laid aside The Fall and returned to writing the rest of Hyperion by April 1819, and in the summer of 1819 returned once again to The Fall to expand it from l. 327 to its close. Two obstacles to this view will be removed: Charles Brown's statements that The Fall was a remodeling of Hyperion and Professor Jack Stillinger's conclusion that Charlotte Reynolds copied Woodhouse's transcript of The Fall . Finally, Keats's own report of the poetry written in the summer of 1819 will show the strong probability that he resumed The Fall with l. 327 at that time. The fundamental evidence upon which my argument is based is the transcript of poems by Keats in the Reynolds-Hood Commonplace Book in the Bristol Central Library, 4 which has not been taken into account properly by anyone who has studied the relationship between the two Hyperions . It contains fifteen poems by Keats (counting Extracts from an Opera as one), including The Fall of Hyperion , ll. 1-326. Thirteen of them have been dated with certainty, and they were all written in 1817 or 1818. 5 Though "Stanzas: You Say You Love" is not dated on any transcript, no one recently to the best of my knowledge has dated it later than 1818. 6 Aside from The Fall of Hyperion , ll. 1-326, the last written poem among the transcripts is "Sonnet Translated from Ronsard," 22 September 1818. 7 Why wasn't a single poem included from the prolific and golden year of 1819? The easiest, and therefore most probable, inference is that they were copied into the commonplace book late in 1818. Why wasn't the rest of The Fall included? Again the simplest answer is that it had not been written at the time of the transcribing. Keats's letter to James Rice of 24 November 1818 corroborates the inference that Reynolds received these manuscripts from Keats and had his sister Charlotte copy them into his commonplace book late in 1818. 8 To illustrate how friends can misunderstand each other, Keats wrote: I am everlastingly getting my mind into such like painful trammels—and am even at this moment suffering under them in the case of a friend of ours. I will tell you—Two most unfortunate and paralel slips—it seems downright preintention. A friend says to me 'Keats I shall go and see Severn this Week' 'Ah' says I 'You want him to take your Portrait' and again 'Keats' says a friend 'When will you come to town again' 'I will' says I 'let you have the Mss next week' In both these I appeard to attribute an interested motive to each of my friends' questions—the first made him flush; the second made him look angry—And yet I am innocent—in both cases my Mind leapt over every interval &lt;between&gt; to what I saw was per se a pleasant subject with him. 9 Rollins identifies the friend cautiously, "Perhaps Reynolds. But if Keats refers to two friends, the second may have been Woodhouse" (I, 407n). But the caution is unnecessary, since the weight of the evidence indicates two remarks to one friend. The only ambiguous phrase is "to each of my friends' questions," and the context guides one to understand that Keats misplaced the apostrophe and that he meant "to each of the questions of my friend." Ample evidence supports the identification of Reynolds as the friend. He was a friend of Rice's, and Reynolds was very close to Rice. He planned to visit Severn, and Reynolds visited Severn frequently, having written Keats on 14 October 1818, "when shall I go with you to Severn's" (I, 377). Severn did paint Reynolds' portrait. Reynolds had earlier requested that Keats provide him with copies of his poems: on 14 October 1818 he had written, "You will gratify me much by letting me have, whenever you have leisure, copies of what you write" (I, 377). Surely M. B. Forman's conclusion is warranted, "I think this friend—the two slips clearly belong to one occasion—was Reynolds." 10 There is every reason to believe that Keats performed what he promised by delivering the manuscripts to Reynolds in early December 1818 and that Reynolds had them transcribed, including The Fall of Hyperion , ll. 1-326. The last inference, however, leads to the thorniest problem of all, a problem which has caused me on several earlier occasions to abandon further investigation after being convinced that all the other pieces fit the pattern perfectly. How could ll. 294-326 of The Fall of Hyperion possibly have been written before December 1818? The Induction poses no difficulty, but the last thirty-two lines include a reworking of the first twenty-one lines of Hyperion , and, as Sir Sidney Colvin demonstrated conclusively so long ago as 1887, the passages in The Fall of Hyperion which parallel passages in Hyperion are clearly a revision of Hyperion . 11 Colvin was not aware of the transcription of The Fall in the Reynolds-Hood Commonplace Book, which was not discovered until 1932 and did not become widely known until H. W. Garrod's edition of The Poetical Works of John Keats in 1939, but those 326 lines are reasonably close to the Milnes printed text of 1857, which he knew. 12 Colvin also did not have Keats's autograph of Hyperion , which did not come to light until 1905, 13 but he did have a Woodhouse transcript of Hyperion , which included penciled records of earlier readings from the autograph. His shrewd scrutiny revealed that in every case passages from The Fall were revisions, and he concluded with a thunderclap, "the proof is from all sides absolute; and the 'first version' theory [that The Fall had been written first] must disappear henceforward from editions of and commentaries on our poet" (p. 228). Further evidence unknown to him, however, argues that he was only half right. Beginning his citations immediately after l. 21 of Hyperion and l. 326 of The Fall , Colvin did not prove that ll. 294-326 of The Fall included revisions of ll. 1-21 of Hyperion because he lacked the full evidence of Keats's autograph of Hyperion (Garrod's A). But careful comparison of the autograph and corresponding sections in ll. 294-326 of The Fall shows indisputably that they too are in fact revisions. The clearest and most emphatic example is the famous adjective "realmless" modifying "eyes" in l. 324 of The Fall . The autograph of Hyperion shows that Keats began with "whitebrowd", shifted to "ancient", and canceled that in favor of "realmless" (Garrod, p. 277n.); The Fall includes only the final, masterful "realmless". How then could the version of The Fall copied into the Reynolds-Hood Commonplace Book have been written before Hyperion ? All Keatsian scholars know that Woodhouse wrote at the end of the transcript which he made of Hyperion , "Copied 20 Ap l 1819 from J. K.'s Manuscript written in 1818-19" (Garrod, p. 305n.), and all major recent biographers of Keats have set the time of composition of Hyperion from the fall or winter of 1818 until the spring of 1819. The answer is startling in its simplicity. Everyone for the last twenty-five years since Dorothy Hewlett's biography has been almost right about the time of composition of Hyperion , but not completely so. Keats wrote the first twenty-one lines of Hyperion before the Scottish tour. George knew before he left England on 24 June 1818 that Keats's next major project was the fall of Hyperion (II, 12). The canceled Advertisement for the 1820 printed version of Hyperion reports that Keats "commenced the Poem just before the Publication of his Endymion; and he abandoned the &lt;idea&gt; intention of proceeding with it, in consequence of the reception that work experienced from some of the reviews.—" 14 Endymion was published sometime from about 27 April until 19 May 1818. 15 Heretofore no one has paid much attention to either the canceled Advertisement or the abbreviated and revised version which was printed because Keats wrote opposite the latter in one copy of the Lamia volume, "This is none of my doing—I was ill at the time. This is a lie" (Bush, p. 189). But the relevant part of the printed version reads, "The poem was intended to have been of equal length with Endymion , but the reception given to that work discouraged the author from proceeding" (Lowell, II, 424); it says nothing of Keats's beginning the poem before the publication of Endymion . Keats gave the lie only to the claim that he broke off the poem because of the adverse reviews. There is no reason to doubt that he "commenced," and only barely so, by writing before 19 May at the latest the first twenty-one line passage, which presents of course a magnificently self-contained scene. Keats was at first eager to read aloud to his friends the recently completed Isabella (by 27 April); he wrote Bailey that he longed to read it to him in Scotland (I, 294), and he did read it aloud to Brown on the walking tour (Forman, p. 160n.). He had not, however, made enough progress with what his friends understood to be his next major project to justify either reading aloud the opening passage of Hyperion or mentioning it in his letters, at least not in those which have been preserved. In Keats's day, only Woodhouse would have thought such an apparently small matter important, and it was he who wrote the canceled Advertisement to preserve the truth, unrecognized though it has been for so long. Two obstacles must be overcome if my view that Keats wrote the Induction to The Fall of Hyperion in September and October 1818 is to be accepted. The first is Charles Brown, who reported that at the time Keats was writing The Cap and Bells late in 1819, "In the evenings, at his own desire, he was alone in a separate sitting-room, deeply engaged in remodelling his poem of 'Hyperion' into a 'Vision.' The change in the conduct of the poem has not, in the opinion of his friends, been regarded as an improvement." 16 Brown also endorsed a wrapper enclosing transcripts of poems made by Woodhouse's clerks in 1833, "Hyperion (remodelled) with minor poems" (Stillinger, p. 29). But Brown was far from infallible. Without going to the extreme of Charles Dilke, who noted that Brown's "Life of Keats" was "a dream on the subject," a recent critic has declined to accept his account of the composition of another poem. Robert Gittings has demonstrated that Brown probably confused Ode to a Nightingale with Ode on Indolence in the famous story about recovering the scraps of paper from behind books. 17 Gittings suggests that R. M. Milnes heard of Dilke's skepticism about Brown's account and therefore modified the story in his edition of Keats's poems in 1876. In his statements about The Fall of Hyperion , Brown would be only a little more than half wrong if the present argument should be accepted; 45% of the poem would still be a remodelling of Hyperion . When Milnes first published The Fall in 1857, he said that he did not know which of the two versions was earlier. When he republished it in 1867, something had changed his opinion so that he oversimplified by declaring without reservation that The Fall was the first version. It seems likely that he overstated the case in the later edition, because one of Keats's surviving friends—Dilke, Severn, Charlotte Reynolds, Clarke, or Holmes—told him that much of The Fall had been written before Hyperion . In any event, it is clear that Milnes did not believe Brown in 1867, and we too should be wary of him and open to other possibilities. The second obstacle is much more formidable, Professor Jack Stillinger's conclusion that Charlotte Reynolds copied Woodhouse's transcript of The Fall (W 2 ). Stillinger's massive study of all Keatsian MSS in The Texts of Keats's Poems is one of the greatest contributions to Keatsian scholarship. His overall success, however, creates a problem: whenever he does make an error, the weight of his deserved authority makes it difficult to see. It is necessary to quote Stillinger at considerable length. After having cited evidence that Woodhouse copied a lost holograph of The Fall of Hyperion made from a prior first draft, and after having proved conclusively that Woodhouse copied from the lost holograph, Stillinger continues: Charlotte Reynolds' transcript of I.1-326 differs substantively from W 2 only in 7 ("the" for "they," like several of the other variants a simple copying error), 10 ("chain"), 19 ("were" for "where"), 51 ("wrapt"—W 2 has "wrapt" with the "w" deleted), 69 (the same words as in W 2 but without Woodhouse's transposition marks), 75 (the omission of the line), 147 ("the" for "that"), 165-166 (the omission of two half-lines), 185 (the omission of "love of"), 188 ("in" for "into"), 234 ("painted"), 259 ("I" for "It"), 298 ("what"—W 2 has "was" with a penciled "what?" in the margin), 299 ("on"), and 319 ("footmark"). The two transcripts are strikingly close in minor details—both, for example, omit the opening quotation mark at I.156, and there are substantial passages (e.g., I.155-185, 241-255, 266-279, 307-326) where their punctuation is exactly the same in every particular—and the situation is such that one of them almost surely had to have come from the other. It is not possible that Woodhouse copied Charlotte, since she has only the first 326 lines (and also some omissions within those); the conclusion, then, is that she took her lines from W 2 (see also Section II.5) (pp. 260-261). The essential passages in the cross-reference relating to The Fall of Hyperion would seem to be these: These transcripts [Charlotte's] bear a close relationship to Woodhouse's W 2 copies. They generally have the same headings as those in W 2 , the same dates (when Charlotte includes dates), the same arrangement and indention of lines, and for fragmentary pieces the same dashes and x's at the end to indicate incompleteness. In a total of 673 lines, Charlotte's texts differ substantively from W 2 in only twenty variants, more than half of which are obviously her copying errors. In accidentals, especially in punctuation, her transcripts are again very similar to the W 2 texts. . . . In some poems and passages the punctuation is quite conventional, and it would not be difficult to imagine two writers independently pointing the lines in the same way; but in other places—for example, many long and complicated passages of The Fall of Hyperion —the consistent agreement is quite striking. . . . Woodhouse's known tendency to add punctuation and otherwise alter accidentals in the process of copying—especially in copying Keats's frequently erratic and underpunctuated MSS—makes it very unlikely that he and Charlotte worked independently, even if always from the same sources: it would be a fantastic coincidence for both of them to have arrived at the same minute details in so many lines (pp. 48-49). Before undertaking a detailed analysis of Stillinger's argument, I should note at the outset a basic improbability that lies behind it. It is unlikely that Charlotte would go outside the family to Woodhouse for copies of Keats's poems when it was so much easier to borrow them from members of her family right in the house in Little Britain. All the borrowing that we have any record of was in the reverse direction: Woodhouse borrowed Keatsian material from the Reynoldses, not the Reynoldses from Woodhouse. Stillinger's evidence can be divided into three parts: substantives, apparatus of the MSS, and punctuation. The substantive differences are merely neutral; there are some, but they are compatible either with Charlotte's copying W 2 or with her copying independently the same Keats holograph which Woodhouse copied. If I understand him, Stillinger does not argue that the substantives prove the case one way or another. Stillinger's account of the similarity of apparatus between the MSS is misleading because he cites only the similarities and none of the differences. One difference is perhaps not especially important: she signs at the end all the poems but three ("Blue!—'Tis the Life of Heaven," "Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port," and "Sonnet Translated from Ronsard") "J. Keats" or "J. K." Another difference is possibly significant: Charlotte does not number the lines as Woodhouse does. If she had copied from Woodhouse, it would have been simple and convenient to borrow his numbering of the lines for such a long passage. A final difference is, I think, somewhat significant: Charlotte wrote "Canto 1 st " rather than Woodhouse's "Canto 1." Keats preferred the form of "1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd " etc. In the fair copy of Endymion , he wrote "Book 1st," "Book 2 nd ," "Book 3 rd ," and "Book 4 th ." In the holograph Hyperion , he wrote "Book 1 st " and "Canto 2 nd ," though he did shift to "Canto 3—" for the third. In Otho the Great , he used "Act 1st Scene 1st"; "Act 1st. Scene 2nd"; "Act 1 st Scene 2 nd [ the 2 altered to 3]"; "Act 2 nd —Scene 2 nd "; "Act 2 rd Scene 2 nd " (obviously a slip in the act for 3); for Act V, Scene 3, mistakenly "Scene 2 nd "; and for Act V, Scene 4, mistakenly "Scene 3 rd ". 18 Woodhouse usually preserved Keats's kind of numbering, sometimes in shortened form: in his copy of Hyperion , "Book 1 st ", "Book 2 d ", "and Book 3 d ." and in W 2 of The Fall , "Canto 2 d ", but he deviated for the first canto of The Fall with "Canto 1". The small probability is that Charlotte copied her "Canto 1 st " from the Keats holograph. On balance, though the similarities and differences in apparatus between Charlotte and W 2 come close to canceling each other out, I believe that Charlotte's omission of the line-numbering and her writing "Canto 1 st " argue mildly for her copying from the Keats holograph rather than from W 2 . In his account of the punctuation Stillinger is again misleading with the first example cited: that both "omit the opening quotation mark at I.156." That item is more than negated by Charlotte's including the opening quotation marks at I,148, where Woodhouse omitted them. If, as Stillinger implies, Charlotte had been mindlessly following W 2 and omitted the quotation marks at I,156 because she did not find them there, she would also have omitted them at I,148. But she did not, and the probabilities would seem to be that the Keats holograph included them at I,148 and omitted them carelessly at I,156; that Charlotte copied what she saw, including them at I,148 and omitting them at I,156; and that Woodhouse carelessly omitted them at I,148. Crediting Charlotte with a conscious process of deciding that the quotation marks at I,148 were needed and of supplying them when she did not find them in her source is clearly less probable than supposing that Woodhouse carelessly omitted the marks at I,156. The generalized argument that Charlotte must have copied W 2 because the punctuation is the same in many long passages is difficult to assess. The chain of reasoning is that Keats punctuated erratically, that Woodhouse had a "known tendency to add punctuation and otherwise alter accidentals," that Charlotte's punctuation is very close to Woodhouse's, and that therefore the regularized punctuation could not have come to Charlotte from an erratic Keats, but must have come from Woodhouse. Without any testing of the significance of the evidence, the argument from punctuation might seem so persuasive as to tip the balance. A completely satisfactory testing is not possible, since we have no case where Woodhouse transcribed a holograph fair copy of comparable length without filtering through shorthand. It is important to note that Stillinger decides, and I concur, that the source of W 2 was a copy and not the original draft. It is also important to note that Stillinger has proved on the basis of Keats's preparation of some fair copy for Poems of 1817 that Keats "could punctuate and spell correctly when he wanted to" (p. 64). Fortunately an approximate test of the significance of the similar punctuation is possible, since Woodhouse copied the W 2 transcript of Hyperion directly from the holograph. This test is only approximate because, unlike the source of the W 2 transcript of The Fall , the holograph of Hyperion was the draft and not a fair copy. Though some have doubted that the holograph of Hyperion was the first and only draft of the poem, I agree with Stillinger that we ought to accept Woodhouse's distinct and emphatic assertion that it was. It is not nearly so thoroughly marked up as the original drafts of other long poems, but it does include many cancellations and insertions above the lines, in the margins, and on the facing pages. 19 Comparison of the W 2 transcript of Hyperion with the holograph reveals that Woodhouse was perfectly capable of reproducing "substantial passages" with the punctuation "exactly the same in every particular." I report only the passages of six lines or more where the punctuation is identical: I, 11-16, 23-29, 31-51, 107-119, 220-225, 299-306; II, 4-9, 51-59, 159-165, 310-315; III, 73-78, a line included in the MSS but omitted from 1820 plus 126-130. I have kept this record as strictly as my scrutiny would allow; in some cases the strictness may not give a full impression of the closeness in long passages. For example, if in I,298 the dot of Woodhouse's semicolon in W 2 fell on the crossing of the t as seems very likely from the position, and is therefore indiscernible, then the two MSS would be the same for fourteen lines, I, 293-306. And, except for one faint and almost illegible comma in the holograph at the end of III,131, which Woodhouse may have over-looked, the last twelve lines are the same—III, line deleted from 1820 plus 126-136. But even without the two appended suggestions, there are a twenty-one line passage and a thirteen line passage. The twenty-one line passage is not so long as the thirty-one line passage cited by Stillinger in the MSS of The Fall , and there are considerable differences in the punctuation elsewhere in the MSS of Hyperion , but the differing degrees of similarity must be balanced against the fact that Woodhouse transcribed from a draft and not a copy in Hyperion . The test, I believe, reduces the significance of Stillinger's argument from punctuation to very little. It need not seem especially surprising that Woodhouse and Charlotte could transcribe a Keats holograph independently and preserve the punctuation in unbroken passages for about one-fourth of the document, while they varied somewhat in the rest of it. Unless we consider the small differences in the apparatus of the MSS sufficiently persuasive to indicate a holograph source for Charlotte, we are virtually back where we started, with both possibilities open: that Charlotte copied from the holograph or that she copied from W 2 . There is, however, another set of accidentals not considered by Stillinger which, in my opinion, will solve the problem beyond reasonable doubt—the spelling. A few of Charlotte's spelling variants are of doubtful significance, though they incline slightly toward a Keats holograph. "Pendant" for "pendent" (I,198) sounds a little Keatsian since Keats sometimes misspelled words ending in "dent" like "independent" that way, but so do a great many other careless people. "Ancient" (I,326) agrees with Keats's spelling of the word rather than what looks like Woodhouse's pedantic quaintness in his "antient". A repeated misspelling is of a different order and is definitely significant: Charlotte included "cans't" for Woodhouse's "canst" twice (I,117,167), though she once spelled it correctly without the offending apostrophe (I,108). Keats had a habit of writing "can'st" or "cans't"; one or the other appears in the fair copy of Endymion , II,125 (from which it even slipped into print), in Hyperion , I,338 (very faint), 339, 343, and III,69. In addition, George Keats, who Stillinger assures us was a careful copyist, almost certainly took from a Keats holograph the three examples in his transcript of Grecian Urn , ll. 3, 15, and 17. 20 For a writer in the early nineteenth century, "canst" was not a contraction and needed no apostrophe. According to the O.E.D. , the forms "canest" and "cannest" occurred occasionally in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the dominant form has always been "canst." It seems highly unlikely that Keats ever saw a "canest" in print; if concordances can be trusted, the word does not appear in the King James Bible, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Words-worth, or Coleridge—the word is always "canst" without any apostrophe because no letter was omitted. Either by false analogy with such contractions as "com'st" from "comest" or by loose association with "can't", Keats developed the habit of writing "can'st" or "cans't". Woodhouse was sometimes capable of copying Keats's "can'sts" unthinkingly, as he did in the W 2 Hyperion , I,338, 339, and 343, but he did not include the superfluous apostrophe for any of the "cansts" in the W 2 The Fall of Hyperion . Charlotte could not have seen them there. If she had written "cans't" once, it could possibly be charged to the same process of human carelessness that makes twentieth-century writers who know better and who are contemptuous of the error nevertheless add an apostrophe accidentally to the possessive "its." But hardly twice. The probability is that she was looking at a Keats holograph. A final misspelling is most convincing of all. In my photocopy of Charlotte's transcript at I,287, the word which is written clearly "forlorn" in W 2 is unclear in the space immediately after the "f". To my request for careful scrutiny of the MS, Mr. Geoffrey Langley, County Reference Librarian at the Bristol Central Library, kindly responded as follows: "I have examined the line in question, and find that the difficulty is caused by an alteration of the spelling from the originally written 'folorn' to 'forlorn.' The over-writing of 'or' is in a darker ink, but as far as can be seen from such a limited sample it is in the same hand." Keats's distinctive, even weird misspelling "folorn" has long been known; so early as 1939, H. W. Garrod (p. xvii) reported that Keats wrote "not 'forlorn,' but, as his habit was everywhere, 'folorn.'" Keats wrote "folorn" fourteen different times: I Stood Tiptoe , l. 172; Endymion , I,205; II, 859; III, 689; IV,372,373; Lamia , II,49,282; Isabella , l. 497 (the draft); St. Agnes , l. 333; Nightingale , ll. 70,71; Hyperion , II,35; and Otho , I,2.87. Garrod's "everywhere" involves slight rhetorical license for emphasis, since Keats did write "forlorn" twice. The exception in Endymion , III,227 is easily explained: Reynolds, who revised the first draft (sloppily, if he is responsible for missing the other five misspellings of the word), probably corrected the error and Keats copied the correction. 21 The second exception is the Egerton MS (Garrod's E) of Isabella , l. 497, and again it is noteworthy that this is a fair copy—writing more spontaneously in the draft, he had misspelled it "folorn". 22 The exceptions are small and explainable as such; Keats's misspelling of the word is firmly established. Charlotte could have seen the "folorn" which she copied first nowhere else but in the lost Keats holograph; that she (or possibly someone else) came back later to correct the spelling does not alter the fact that she first set down the Keatsian misspelling. I believe that the probability is so strong that it should be generally accepted that Woodhouse and Charlotte copied the same Keats holograph independently. Before leaving discussion of the MS, I must present one other piece of evidence which supports my central contention that Charlotte copied the first 326 lines of The Fall before Keats had finished writing the rest of the fragment. As Stillinger observes, Charlotte used "for fragmentary pieces . . . dashes and x's at the end to indicate incompleteness" (p. 48). Immediately after I,326, without any break, she included a line of fourteen x's and two dashes, one beneath the other, under the fifth x. These, I submit, are a clear indication of her meaning: "That is all there is; there is no more to copy." By the time Woodhouse secured the same holograph, probably some time after December 1819, Keats had added the rest of the fragment. We may turn now to other sources for evidence bearing upon Keats's composition of the Induction to The Fall . After his return from the Scottish tour on 18 August 1818, Keats probably did not write anything for three weeks because of Tom's illness, his own illness, and his resolve to study and reflect before writing further. On 14 September at the party at Hessey's, he disturbed Woodhouse deeply by declaring that he had stopped writing poetry (I,45). But about 21 September he changed his mind, as he reported to Dilke in a letter of that date (I,369), and sought in poetry relief from his feelings about Jane Cox and from the haunting effects of Tom's fatal illness. Instead of resuming with Hyperion , as most have supposed for the last several decades, I maintain that he put it aside and began an entirely new version, The Fall of Hyperion . Passages in the letters to Dilke and Reynolds have some small significance as a hint pointing toward The Fall rather than Hyperion . He wrote Dilke, "I am obliged to write, and plunge into abstract images" (I,369), and he echoed the word "abstract" with slight variation to Reynolds, "This morning Poetry has conquered—I have relapsed into those abstractions which are my only life. . . . Poor Tom— that woman [Jane Cox]—and Poetry were ringing changes in my senses" (I,370). Ten months later, when he resumed The Fall , he attached the same idea of abstractness to it and associated it with strong feeling for a woman, though a different one. He wrote Fanny Brawne on 25 July 1819, "Forgive me if I wander a little this evening, for I have been all day employ'd in a very abstr[a]ct Poem and I am in deep love with you—two things which must excuse me" (II,132). One must not, however, exaggerate Keats's association of "abstract" with The Fall , since elsewhere he links it generally with beauty and poetry (I,373,403). In the next three weeks Keats probably wrote all of the entirely new Induction, ll. 1-293, and wove passages from Hyperion , ll. 1-21, into the new version as ll. 294-326 of The Fall . I suspect that he did not find congenial the task of reworking old material. When Reynolds called on 13 October and borrowed a copy of Isabella (I,45), he must have learned also of Keats's work on The Fall , and, I would surmise, he may have received some indication that Keats did not intend to proceed with it, at least for a time. On 14 October Reynolds urged Keats to publish Isabella because "its completeness will be a full answer to all the ignorant malevolence of cold lying Scotchmen and stupid Englishmen" (I,376; italics supplied). That word "completeness" deserves consideration which it has never received. The implication is that there was another poem available which was not then suitable for publication because it was incomplete, and that poem was, I contend, The Fall , ll. 1-326. My reason for suspecting that Keats had already decided by 13 October to lay it aside is that otherwise Reynolds might not have been inclined even to consider its publication. Later in October Keats began work again on the Hyperion project, but according to my view instead of continuing with The Fall he returned to the original manuscript of Hyperion and expanded from the first twenty-one lines. On 27 October he wrote Woodhouse of "cogitating on the Characters of saturn and Ops" (I,387). Any mention of sympathetic identification, negative capability, and the egotistical sublime, subjects treated or implied in that letter, is likely to arouse some disagreement because readers have explored these rich and provocative concepts so deeply that different individuals have inevitably assigned differing weights to particular implications, ramifications, and nuances. And yet most will agree, I think, that at least in the obvious surface sense The Fall of Hyperion , which I believe that Keats had just renounced, is the egotistical sublime. An intense effort to achieve the sublime it certainly is, and it is also in a sense egotistical, though the nature and quality of Keats's subjectivity differ of course from Wordsworth's. Just as clearly, the "severe magnificence" of Hyperion is as objective as The Fall was subjective. Keats would have been especially well prepared to develop the critical distinctions in the famous letter if, as I contend, he had just rejected for a time the subjective in favor of the objective. There is no reason to suppose that his progress on Hyperion differed from the conjectural outlines of it provided by Keats's recent biographers. He completed it by 20 April 1819 when Woodhouse copied it. Shortly before 24 November 1818 he told Reynolds that he would let him "have the Mss next week" (I,407). He could lend Reynolds the manuscript of The Fall , along with the other manuscripts, because he was not then working on it and did not plan to work on it any time soon. Reynolds had all the manuscripts transcribed and presumably returned them to Keats as he had Isabella before (I,376-377). One final piece of evidence from the holograph of Hyperion should be introduced at this point to support my position that Keats began Hyperion before 19 May 1818, broke it off before the Scottish tour, and then returned to it once again later. He headed the first section of Hyperion "Book 1 st ." He shifted from "Book" to "Canto 1 st " for the first section of The Fall . When he returned to the Hyperion MS in October, he completed the first section and proceeded to the other two, but, forgetting his initial designation of the first section as "Book 1 st " in Hyperion , he continued there with the headings to which he had shifted for The Fall , "Canto 2 nd " and "Canto 3". The alternating from one version to the other and then back to the first explains an otherwise inexplicable inconsistency. A major difficulty for biographers who have maintained that Keats wrote almost all of The Fall of Hyperion in the summer and fall of 1819 has always been insufficient time. Keats's own statistics reveal that he could have written very little of it from 14 June to 14 August 1819. On the latter date, he wrote Bailey, "Within these two Months I have written 1500 Lines . . . . I have written . . . Lamia—(half finished—I [hav]e a[l]so been writing parts of my Hyperion and [c]ompleted 4 Acts of a Tragedy" (II,139). All recent biographers except Ward infer that by "Hyperion" Keats meant The Fall . The first part of Lamia and the first four acts of Otho the Great include a total of 1,860 lines. Although the "1500 Lines" was clearly just a rough estimate, it seems unlikely that he could have written much of the 468 lines of the first canto of The Fall without rounding off the estimate at a higher figure. He told Fanny Brawne on 25 July that he had spent "all day" (II,132) on The Fall , but it seems doubtful that he could achieve more than half of his old quota of fifty lines of Endymion a day in composing the condensed and mellow poetry of The Fall . Grant for the sake of argument that he wrote thirty on that day and another twenty at times not mentioned. That would leave 424 lines yet to be written by 21 September when he quoted Canto II, 1-4,6 in a letter to Woodhouse (II,171). It strains credibility to believe that with all his travelling and his activities in behalf of George he could have written in the thirty-eight days from 14 August to 21 September Act V of Otho (363 lines), Part II of Lamia (311 lines), and "To Autumn" (33 lines) for a total of 707 lines and still have time to write another 424 lines of The Fall . One senses a strained credibility even in those who have believed that Keats wrote the Induction in the summer and early fall of 1819. W. J. Bate, for example, writes that after subtracting the time for Act V of Otho and other activities, "This leaves little more than three weeks relatively free for other work. During that short time he took off a few days to write the second half of Lamia and tried to go on with the revised Hyperion , possibly writing most of it at this time", and again, "Keats, left to himself, would be able to find some time for the Fall of Hyperion " (pp. 562, 574). On the other hand, Aileen Ward, who decides that it was impossible for Keats to have written by 21 September 1819 all The Fall through Canto II, ll. 1-4,6, which he quotes in the letter to Woodhouse, strains probability just as badly by contending that Keats composed only those passages quoted and perhaps a few others and afterward from late September through December filled in gaps to complete the remainder of the fragment (p. 434). It is unnecessary to do so much squeezing and twisting for time in either way. The alternative proposed here is far simpler and more probable: that in the summer of 1819 Keats began again on The Fall with the 326 lines which he had written the preceding autumn and expanded them by 148 lines as he adapted passages from Hyperion for the other version until he reached Canto II, ll. 1-4,6, which he quoted for Woodhouse on 21 September 1819. First he quoted the new passage, and then he added two passages from the earlier Induction, which he had no reason to think Woodhouse had seen. The tense of the verb in the introductory sentence to the last quoted passage is significant, as Amy Lowell (II, 343) saw long ago, "Here is what I had written for a sort of induction—" (II,172; italics supplied). The past perfect tense separates the Induction from his current writing and refers to an interval of almost a year. Very little remained for Keats to do with the poem. After he had discontinued it on 21 September, Brown reports that he returned in his growing illness in the winter of 1819 to a feeble attempt to adapt additional material from Hyperion , 23 but, as Aileen Ward has remarked (p. 434), he added only five new lines, transferring practically verbatim the remaining fifty lines of the fragment.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Venetian 'Woodcut' Capitals by A. J. Dunston</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many by-ways branch off from the path followed by a classical scholar interested in the Italian Renaissance: if he succumbs to temptation and wanders down any of them, he soon finds himself hopelessly lost in alien fields. For this reason, and because I have now returned to Australia where further research on the subject is virtually impossible because of the paucity of material available, 1 I make no apology for presenting an incomplete piece of research based on a study of only some 170 incunabula , but rather express the hope that someone who has the appropriate facilities available will pursue the problem further and try to answer with more precision the questions which arise. Towards the end of my sabbatical leave in 1974, I had occasion to examine some of the incunabula printed in Florence by Bartolommeo di Libri. The British Library has 116 copies (excluding duplicates). Decorated capitals are first found in a book dated 5 September 1495 (IA 27311, BMC VI 650: C 3 —S262 2 ): they are B and L, 15 x 15 mm., white on black ground. The 18 books which precede IA 27311, dating from 1482 onwards, have capital spaces with guide letters and/or Lombards. Of the 28 dated and 69 undated books which follow, 48 have capital spaces and/or Lombards, 7 have decorated capitals from sets measuring 20 x 22 mm. and 24 x 29 mm., and 42 have one or more decorated capitals from the 15 x 15 mm. set from which the B and L of IA 27311 came. IB 27385 (BMC VI 654, C 3 —B324), dated 20 July 1499, uses all the letters of the alphabet in this set except B. 3 No other Florentine printer appears to use this set save that the T makes a singular appearance on f.G.1.r. of IB 27636 (BMC VI 651 and 675, C 3 — S243). This is a 'composite' volume dated 8 February 1496/7 4 : di Libri appears to have printed gatherings a-t, using 11 of the capitals in the 15 x 15 mm. set, Morgiani printed gatherings A-F, using capitals from an 18 x 16 mm. set, and Bonaccorsi gatherings G-I, in which the capital T is the only one used. Again, all the letters of the alphabet except B E F O R T are used in C 107 g 16, Incomincia il libro delle omelie di sancto Gregorio papa . This volume bears no indication of date or place of printing. Brunet, Manuel du Libraire , 11 (1861), col. 1725, says "les éditions de cette traduction (Pachel and Scinzenzler Milan 1479, BMC VI 746 [IB 26432] C 3 —C423) sont cette de Florence 1502 pet. in-fol. de 92 ff. à 2 col. sans nom d'imprimeur mais qu'on attribue aux Junte. . . ." But perhaps the volume is Venetian (see further n.7). BMC VI 647 says of the decorated capitals used by B. di Libri, "some closely following Venetian models". 5 This prompted a perusal of incunabula produced by printers who either worked in Venice or had Venetian associations, and led to the discovery that no less than 16 of these consistently use what appears to be the same 6 15 x 15 mm. set used in Florence by B. di Libri.

And beyond: for on my return to Australia I found that the 1508 edition of the works of Statius, with the commentary of Domizio Calderini, which I happen to own and which was printed in Venice by Petrus de Quarengis, has all the letters except B M V. The set is not, of course, always used exclusively and printers from time to time used it in conjunction with other sets they possessed. For example, Joannes and Gregorius de Gregoriis used a variety of sets including another but very similar 15 x 15 mm. white on black ground set which is used by itself in IB 21105 (BMC V348, C 3 —A979) and in conjunction with the other in IB 21097 (BMC V 348, C 3 —A965). Plate 1A illustrates the nineteen letters of the set from IB 23272 (BMC V 457-8, C 3 —L315), Lucas de Burgo somma di aritmetica , printed in November 1494 by Jacobus and Hieronymus Paganinus. The C and A may be compared with those in Plate 1B: IA 22745 (BMC V 485, C 3 —C103), Cantalicus Epigrammata , printed on 20 January 1493/4 by Matteo Capcasa. Plate 1C shows the O used by Bartolommeo di Libri, IA 27595 (BMC VI 665, C 3 —S273), Savonarola, Triumphus Crucis , undated. Further comparisons may be made with the set as reproduced (except for O) by F. Ongania in L'arte della stampa nel rinascimento italiano , Venice, n.d., p. 81, and with the S and V reproduced in BMC V Plate XXXIII and BMC VII Plate C respectively. 15 We must now try to define a little more clearly exactly what we are dealing with here. Though borrowings of type and woodcut capitals and borders is well attested, 16 it is quite impossible that we have here a single set of capitals. Quite apart from the intrinsic improbability of such a large number of printers sharing a common set, no wood or metal set could have lasted so long. In any case close examination reveals, as we shall see, differences, minute maybe but still differences, between some printings of the same capital letter and others. A more pertinent question is perhaps, "Of what material were the blocks made anyway? Metal or wood?" BMC I, intro. p. xvii, refers to "relief-blocks, whether wood or metal used for pictorial illustrations and ornaments" and goes on to discuss how both wood and metal blocks can develop faults which will allow a whole series of books to be put into chronological order. BMC V in the sections which preface the descriptions of books produced by each printer consistently uses the term 'Woodcut Capitals': BMC VI uses the term 'Printed Capitals', and BMC VII simply 'Capitals'. Plate 2 shows the left-hand side of f. 109 v. and the right-hand side of f. 110 r. of IB 23272. This makes it clear that Paganinus had at least 7 blocks for decorated capital S. One, on f. 110 r. marked X, is clearly different from the rest. 17 The rest resemble each other in decoration very closely indeed, though one can discern very minute differences here and there. The frame-lines, however, are so chipped or distorted as to allow those on f. 109 v. to be 'paired' with those on f. 110 r. The clearest examples are the last S on f. 109 v. and the top on f. 110 r., where the top of the frameline has a quite distinctive distortion. The rest can be 'paired' as I have indicated in the margins. 18 We have here one printer with 6 near-identical copies of the same block. Taking into consideration the similar duplications that doubtless could be evidenced in the work of this and of other printers, and the whole extent (in time and by so many different printers) of the use of this set, it is clear, I think, that we cannot be dealing with the work of Italian wood-engravers, skilled as they were, but rather with type which has been cast . In reply to a letter written to him making this suggestion, Mr. H. G. Carter of the Oxford University Press very kindly drew my attention to the noun and verb 'dab' in the Oxford English Dictionary: "9. . . . 1889 T. B. Reed ( in letter ), The common process of producing cast ornaments for printing before the introduction of electrotyping was known in English type-foundries as 'dabbing'. 19 The original woodblock is dropped sharply into a bed of molten lead on the point of cooling. A mould or matrix of the design is thus produced. To produce replicas of the design the operator strikes this matrix into lead. The result is a 'cast' or 'dab' in relief, which when mounted can be used to print along with type." Although further research—the examination of more incunabula , and perhaps the enlistment of the aid of optical equipment—is necessary before one can speak with precision about details, it is perhaps already clear that the Venetian typefounders in the last decade of the fifteenth century must have discovered the process of 'dabbing'. This would explain not only the general similarity of the capitals but also the minute differences. It would also explain occurrences such as the following. The normal E of the set has a whorl of leaf and branchwork circling the lower, middle and upper arms of the letter; F has a figure seated in the lower right hand corner. In IB 31189 (BMC VII 982/3, C 3 —S623), printed by Angelus and Jacobus Britannicus on 20 November 1498, is found an E which is in fact the F with a lower arm added to the base of the stem. 20 This same E is also found in IB 21158 (BMC V 352, C 3 —A1416), Joannes and Gregorius de Gregoriis, n.d., and on f. 13 r. of the 1508 Statius mentioned above. It looks as if one cast of the F either accidentally developed a flaw or was deliberately altered so that it took the form of and was used for an E. It has been already noted that the set was not always used exclusively, but often in conjunction with other sets of similar or greater dimensions. Some printers, like Paganinus, had 'duplicates' of individual letters, others had a few alternative blocks which they used co-extensively with those of the set. For example, Joannes Rubeus, in IB 23201 (BMC V 421, C 3 —J487) 23 October 1499, uses an M which is of the same basic design but slightly different, and in IA 23207 (BMC V 422, C 3 —O 79), 10 March 1500, has a second Q. Compare that on f. d 3 r, with that (normal) on f. g 2 r. But the set of initials as illustrated in Plate 1A is the one consistently used. Its predominance among Venetian printers seems to point to a Venetian origin, and there is nothing intrinsically improbable in the suggestion that Bartolommeo di Libri obtained his set (less the O) from that source. Joannes Rubeus and Matteo Capcasa appear to have been the first to use letters from the set: both (see n. 7) seem to have been regularly employed by Luca-Antonio Giunta. Did Luca-Antonio lend a set of capitals to his brother Filippo in Firenze? Was this in fact the 'Florentine connection'? Further research might perhaps examine this possibility.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In 1966, H. G. Kaplan compiled A First Census of Incunabula in Australia and New Zealand (Library of New South Wales, Sydney), containing 503 entries. There have obviously been accessions since that date, but holdings of incunabula are still microscopic compared with those of libraries in Europe and America. 2 I.e., F. R. Goff, Incunabula in American Libraries: a third census (1964). 3 I have followed BMC V and VI and Haebler (in his Typenrepertorium in C. Dziatzko, Sammlung bibliothekswissen-schaftliche Arbeiten 19-40, Halle, 1905-24) in talking of a '15 x 15 mm.' set. In point of fact the width or height of some of the letters is a little smaller: e.g., the A is 14.5 x 14 mm., the B 15 x 14.5 mm., etc. The O used by B. di Libri is 17 x 17 mm. See further note 6. 4 This method of indicating the date is used to indicate that there is doubt whether the normal or the Florentine or Venetian mode of dating (in which the year commences with the Annunciation, March 25) is used. 5 BMC V uses a variety of terms to describe what I hope to establish as a set based on a common origin: these include "white Renaissance ornamentation" (415); "ordinary Venetian design" (453); "the usual style" (479). Haebler ( op. cit. ) uses a similarly varied nomenclature. 6 The O used by the Venetian printers is 15 x 15 mm. and not the 17 x 17 mm. one used by di Libri. 7 BMC V, intro. p. xxxviii, says of J. Rubeus, "the editions which he turned out on his own account are remarkable for not containing a single one of the many woodcut capitals found in his commissioned work and the close affinity of much of his material with that of Capcasa [my italics] suggests that Giunta was the regular employer of both." 8 It was only possible for me to examine about a quarter of the books printed before 1500 by Locatellus, but the sampling was spread evenly over the whole of this period of production. IB 22910 (Cicero, Epistulae ad familiares ) appears to be the only book in which Locatellus uses the 15 x 15 mm. set—if indeed he was the printer: BMC V, intro. p. xi, notes that IB 22910 is one of a group of six books produced for Scotus but not containing the name of Locatellus: this group has other peculiarities too. 9 I was only able to examine one incunabulum printed by Emericus: later ones may well use more of the letters in the set. 10 IB 23666, C 3 —N272 (Nonius Marcellus, de proprietate sermonum ) is a particularly good example of the use of the set (and, indeed, justification of the use of the term 'set'); for some sections, e.g. II, de honestis et noue ueterum dictis de dictionibus ab A etc. littera incipientibus , necessitate the use of all the capitals in alphabetical order. 11 BMC V 505 says of IB 23825, "As both type 81 R and the woodcut capitals used with it appear to be material of Capcasa, this printer perhaps collaborated with de Bonellis in the present book." 12 Dionysius Bertochus printed in a number of North Italian cities: he was in Venice in 1494. IB 34061 was printed in Reggio Emilia. 13 Franciscus de Mazalibus in his Scriptores rei rusticae (IB 34043) clearly uses printing material that Bertochus had used in his edition of the same work (IB 34061). See BMC VII 1088-89. 14 Jacobus Britannicus had numerous printing associations with Venice before moving to Brescia. See BMC VII 972. 15 The page which contains this plate is not, for some reason, to be found in the English-language edition of 1895 ( Early Venetian Printing Illustrated ), but examples of P and H can be found on pages 132 and 142 respectively. I am grateful to the British Library for the provision of the photographs from which the plates were made. 16 A good example is provided by two woodcuts. One measures 56 x 50 mm., is "a peculiar, simply drawn P with the figure of a monk writing and lettered FRA IACOMO DE VORAGINE" (BMC V 338), the other is an E with the figure of a monk writing, measures 32 x 32 mm. and is lettered DV[N] NICOLO MANERBI. (reproduced in O. Jennings, Early Woodcut Initials [1908], pp. 183 and 182 respectively). They can be found in IB 22758 (BMC V 485, C 3 —J180) Matteo Capcasa 3 May 1494; IB 22910 (BMC V 433, C 3 — C531) Bonetus Locatellus 22 September 1494; IB 21111 (BMC V 349, C 3 —A966); and IB 21135 (BMC V 350, C 3 —H160) published by Johannes and Gregorius de Gregoriis on 13 July 1496 and 25 August 1498 respectively. 17 It may prove to have some affinity with a 15 x 15 mm. set used by Locatellus: I noted in IB 22898 (BMC V 442, C 3 —I186) capital A M Q P E V very similar indeed to the 'Venetian' set; also that this same set was used in IB 22900 (BMC V 442, C 3 —P1089), IA 22883 (BMC V 442, C 3 —S802), IB 22906 (BMC V 443, C 3 —H456) and IB 22907 (BMC V 443, C 3 —C609). Unfortunately, though, I recorded an S on f. Z 3 r. in IB 22906. I have no further details of it. 18 It may be no more than a coincidence that the S's on f. 110 r. are used in inverse numerical order to those on f. 109 v. On the other hand it may indicate that the compositor picked the capitals for f. 110 r. from the frame on which f. 109 v. was set up. 19 See also P. Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), pp. 208-209 and n. 10. 20 See f. e ii r, where it is used for F, though the printers had a normal F — cf. f. a 7 v.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Sir John Harington's A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops, to the Yeare 1608 : Composition and Text by R. H. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aside from a few brief accounts over the past three hundred years, there has been no complete history of the composition and promulgation of Sir John Harington's A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops , to the Yeare 1608 . 1 My recent discovery of two additional manuscripts of this most remarkable piece of church history and personal recollection makes the need for an accounting all the more compelling, particularly since one of these manuscripts contains textual material that has not appeared in print to date, and since it represents an earlier version of the text than has hitherto been known. The Supplie was ostensibly in its conception and execution a private work, intended for the use of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of King James I. It was written as a supplement to the first edition of Bishop Francis Godwin's A Catalogue of the Bishops of England (1601), one of the earliest church histories to treat of the lives of the bishops from the beginnings of the English Church to the early years of Elizabeth's reign. Godwin's Catalogue is a valuable history; it was well thought of in its own time and earned him a promotion from Subdean of Exeter Cathedral to Bishop of Llandaff, at that time an impoverished but still prestigious see. The work continued into another English edition, in 1615, and a Latin edition, De praesulibus Angliae commentarius , in 1616, both editions appearing after Harington's death, which occurred in 1612. In the Supplie Harington speaks very highly of Godwin, and Anthony à Wood says of him that he was "a good man, a grave divine, skilful mathematician, excellent philosopher, pure Latinist, and incomparable historian . . ." ( NA3 , II, 220-228; Athenae , II, 555). As a biographical continuation of Godwin's Catalogue , Harington's Supplie contains considerably amplified accounts of the bishops of Godwin's time (and Harington's), accounts which Godwin either chose to omit completely or to include, but in bare, factual prose, devoid of judgments and opinions that might be taken amiss by his own colleagues (see Catalogue [1601], sig. A4r). Harington's intention was to continue Godwin's basic plan but in a much livelier, more open vein, as only Sir John Harington could have done. As a result of Harington's almost conversational, recollective manner, the Supplie becomes a most entertaining and penetrating account of the bishops of the late Tudor-early Stuart period. As an historical document the Supplie is very important, and its insights into the attitudes of one of the most discerning of the Elizabethan courtiers have never been properly valued. 2 Only recently Robert McNulty touched on its worth when he called it "one of the most readable volumes of Church history ever written" (Introduction to Harington's translation of Orlando Furioso , ed. McNulty [1972], p. xxiv). In keeping with the illustriousness of its recipient, Harington prepared a handsome manuscript of the Supplie , including both topical and alphabetical indexes to Godwin's work, as well as to his own, and had the complete manuscript bound in with a copy of the first edition of Godwin's Catalogue , which he then presented to the Prince. 3 This manuscript, described more fully below, is now B.M. Royal MS. 17 B XXII, denoted here by the siglum FC . As nearly as can be ascertained, the work was composed in the latter part of 1607 and early 1608. The last page of the text of the Supplie in FC is dated "18. February. 1607 [OS]," in Harington's hand. In "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand," a postscript appended by Harington to the text of the Supplie , he describes the incident that supposedly inspired the work. A London friend of his had told him of a London preacher who had sermonized on the rhyme, " Henry the 8. pulld down Abbeys and Cells | But Henry the 9. shall pull down Bishops and bells"; and he says that this "Londoner of honest credit" told him of it "about the monthe of August last past," which would have been August 1607. 4 Harington apparently had been incensed enough by the preacher's audacity to complain immediately to someone higher up. In a letter to Sir Thomas Chaloner, Prince Henry's personal attendant and governor, dated 6 September 1607, he refers to the incident, quotes the offending distich, and suggests that the preacher ought to be "bolted" out of the Church immediately (Hist. MSS. Comm., 9 Salisbury XIX, pp. 242-243). Thus by his own testimony Harington places the writing of his sketches between August 1607 and 18 February 1608. His dating seems to be substantially correct, though a letter of his to Prince Henry would seem to indicate that he was at work on the Supplie as early as 1606. In a letter dated 1606 by Thomas Park, in NA3 , I, 363, Harington writes to Prince Henry, "I here sende by my servant such matter as your Highness did covet to see, in regard to Bishop Gardener of Winchester, which I shall sometime more largely treat of and lay at your feet" ( Letters and Epigrams , pp. 127, 405). The rest of the letter is composed almost verbatim of a section of Harington's account of Gardiner in the Supplie ( NA3 , II, 67-68). The letter was first published in Henry Harington's first edition of the Nugae (1769), I, 81, with the date "1609," and Park re-dated it "1606" in his edition, on the assumption that the "9" was a misprint for "6" since, presumably, Henry had already received the Supplie before 1609. To my knowledge no other evidence exists for the dating of this letter. However, a sufficient number of pieces of internal evidence in six of the sections of the Supplie tend to support Harington's dating of his work. In the account of the bishopric of Lincoln, he refers to the wedding of James Hay, first Earl of Carlisle, that took place on 6 January 1607, which would put the writing of that section sometime afterward ( NA3 , II, 113; Cokayne, Complete Peerage , III, 32). Likewise on p. 69 of the manuscript he speaks of "Doctor Willim Chatterton now lyving" ( NA3 , II, 112, does not carry this heading). Chaderton, Bishop of Lincoln, died suddenly on 11 April 1608, just shortly after the date on which Harington states that he completed the Supplie , which would again place the writing of this passage somewhere before early 1608 ( DNB , s.v. William Chaderton). In the section on Salisbury, he talks about having "latelie lookt over my Schola Salerni," which refers to his preparations of that work for publication in 1607 ( FC , p. 77; NA3 , II, 124). It appeared sometime in that year under the title, The Englishman's Doctor, or the School of Salerne ( STC 12605). In the section on Oxford, p. 128, he speaks of that bishopric as having been established "but 66 yeare since . . ." ( NA3 , II, 199). It was created in 1542 by Henry VIII, which again bears out a 1607-1608 dating. In the section on Gloucester, he was sufficiently in the know to include Henry Parry, who had been elected to that see only in June 1607 (John LeNeve, Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae [1854], s.v. Gloucester), though he managed to get Parry's first name wrong (he calls him "Thomas"), and indeed, as he says, makes a "verie short bayt" of his account of this bishop, who was then "skant yet warme in his seat" ( NA3 , II, 204; FC , p. 130). In the section on Durham, he refers to William James as having been bishop "skant a yeare and a day" ( FC , p. 174; NA3 , II, 270). James had succeeded Toby Mathew on 7 September 1606, which again would place the writing in the Fall of 1607 (LeNeve, Fasti , s.v. Durham). In the last section, the "occasion," Adam Newton, tutor to Prince Henry, is referred to as " Deane of Dirham ," a position to which he had been appointed on 27 September 1606, which places the composition of this section at some time thereafter ( FC , p. 184; NA3 , II, 9; LeNeve, Fasti , s.v. Durham). In sum, these references to contemporary events and persons are sufficiently scattered through the Supplie to justify our accepting the conclusion that the bulk of the work was indeed composed in 1607, and in final form for presentation to Henry by mid-February of 1608. The earliest extant text of the Supplie is an incomplete manuscript copy in Harington's secretary hand; it is here designated the A MS., now B.M. Add. MS. 46370. Little is known about it, other than what is revealed by textual evidence. Its existence was not established until its discovery by Ruth Hughey, in 1933, among other manuscripts in the possession of the Harington family. 5 It remained in the family's keeping from the time of its writing until its sale to the British Museum in 1947, by Miss Philippa Harington. 6 It contains no date, although textual evidence indicates that it is the copy from which the fair-copy manuscript, B.M. Royal MS. 17 B XXII, or FC , was made. The manuscript is a quarto volume bound in nineteenth-century quarter-calf with marbled paper boards and vellum corners, containing 68 leaves and measuring 183 x 136 mm. The paper is ruled in red margins throughout, with the first four leaves and the last four leaves of a later, somewhat whiter and heavier paper. The edges have been trimmed and are stained green. The leaves contain folio numbers added in pencil at a later time; for the sake of clarity I have chosen to adopt these later foliations in my comments. The contents are as follows: [i], blank; [ii r ], contains a pasted-down piece with the following notation in a late seventeenth-century cursive hand, "The historye of the | Bisshoppes since the reformation | a supplement to D r Godwyne | written by S r John Harington"; [ii v -iii], blank; 1 r , contains the notation, "Published in Nugae Antiquae," in an eighteenth-century hand; 1 v , text, beginning with the section of Winchester, in a seventeenth-century cursive hand; 2 r -61, text, continued in Harington's secretary hand; 62, text, again in the hand of f. 1 v ; [63-65], blank. Laid in loose at the end are two leaves of miscellaneous theological and historical notes in the hand of Harington's son John, the parliamentarian (1589-1654). The A MS. lacks the following sections of the complete Supplie : Canterbury, London, Bath and Wells, the concluding section following the section on Chester, and "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand," constituting pp. 3-54, 132-165, and 277-278 of the text in NA3 , Vol. II. Parts of the sections of Winchester at the beginning of the manuscript and of Chester at the end were removed, but these sections were restored by the writer of the seventeenth-century cursive script of ff. 1 v and 62. In the middle of the manuscript the whole section of Bath and Wells is missing, together with the last part of Salisbury ( NA3 , II, 131.2-8) and the first few lines of Exeter ( NA3 , II, 166.1-9). This missing section may have been used as setting copy for Henry Harington's 1769 edition of the Nugae , which contains only that part of the Supplie . Young Henry Harington gained a reputation for having mutilated manuscripts in preparing his editions and may have removed the leaves of the Bath and Wells section for that edition. 7 As previously indicated, the manuscript is otherwise in Harington's secretary hand, with some material in italic. The hand shows variations, but they are not unusual and conform to variations in other manuscripts already accepted as autograph, for example, in B.M. Add. MSS. 12049, the Epigrams; 18920, the Orlando; 46368, the Metamorphosis of Ajax. The hand was first identified as Harington's by Ruth Hughey in her article, mentioned in n. 5, p. 402. A is a copy made from an earlier draft, as there are a number of places in the manuscript where Harington mistakenly repeated parts of sentences and then crossed them out or in some cases missed his repetitions and let them stand (ff. 8 r .13; 20 v .1; 22 v .8, 11; 45 r .5-6, 11; 56 r .27). In relation to the other manuscripts, A is the earliest manuscript. Since it was copied from an earlier draft and was the copy used in making FC , it can be dated with some exactness as late 1607-early 1608, between Harington's completion of the first draft version and the final version, FC , which was completed by 18 February 1608. The fair-copy manuscript, FC , now in the Royal Manuscripts Collection in the British Museum, is in Harington's italic hand and is the latest autograph text of the Supplie . As noted previously, it is now catalogued as B.M. Royal MS. 17 B XXII, and carries the date "18. February. 1607 [OS]" in Harington's hand, on p. 178. The manuscript, bound in with a copy of the first edition of Francis Godwin's A Catalogue of the Bishops of England (1601), was presented to Prince Henry sometime after February of 1608. It immediately became a part of Henry's excellent library, and then was taken into the Royal Library on Henry's premature death. 8 It became a part of the British Museum's holdings when the Royal Library was turned over to that institution in the eighteenth century. It is now bound in half brown morocco with linen cloth boards; according to the Museum's records the rebinding was done in 1966. It was originally bound in brown calf for Henry; the portion of the binding containing the arms of the Prince is now preserved on the front free endpaper at the beginning of the volume. 9 The manuscript measures 197 x 145 mm. It is erratically paged 1-45 [46-70], 1-7, 6-111, 114-187 [188-190], and folio numbers have been added in a later hand numbering 280-407, consecutively with Godwin's Catalogue . The printed text of Godwin's Catalogue was also given rubrished margins like those of the manuscript, and Harington added in his own hand corrections of typographical errors in the printed text, and marginal glosses and resumes. These glosses were added after Harington had completed his Supplie , as they contain cross references to it. Contents of the manuscript are as follows: pp. 1-44, topical index to Godwin's Catalogue , arranged by bishoprics; 45-[46], blank; [47-69], "A Table Alphabeticall annexed to the Booke of the Catalogue of Bishops"; [70], blank; 1-[179], "A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops, to the yeare 1608," and on p. 178 the date of the work appears, "18. February. 1607 [OS]"; 180-187, "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand"; [188-190], blank. Thus the manuscript consists of two parts: (1) the two indexes to Godwin's Catalogue and (2) the text of the Supplie . The handwriting is identical to that of the autograph manuscript of his Epigrams in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Fo, MS. V. a. 249, to Cambridge Add. MS. 337, a manuscript version of some epigrams appended to a printed copy of the Orlando Furioso , and to the examples of Harington's italic script within the various manuscripts in his secretary hand, most notably B.M. Add. MSS. 12049, 18920, and 46368. 10 The hand of this particular manuscript is also identified as Harington's by W. W. Greg in English Literary Autographs , Section XLV, p. [2]. The text is in italic script, whereas titles, special quotes, and Latin phrases are in roman script. The fair-copy manuscript is a beautifully prepared manuscript book, showing careful copying and neat calligraphy. Collation shows that FC was copied from A . In FC , p. 165.14-15, Harington, in copying, slipped over a complete single line of A (f. 56 r .10) and omitted it from FC . All corrections of the text in A are consistently incorporated in FC , and readings that are clearly errors in A are corrected in FC . There are 260 substantive variants between the two manuscripts, but none of them is extensive; most reflect the fact that in preparing the fair copy, Harington took the opportunity to polish the text as he copied. FC is textually unique, since it is the autograph fair-copy manuscript, representing Harington's final intentions. None of the other texts can rival its authority. Data on substantive variants between FC and other texts is given in Appendix II. Two manuscripts of obscure origin, neither one holograph, have not as yet been noted in print. B.M. Harl. MS. 1220, ff. 134-248, constitutes a full and unique text of the Supplie , the individual leaves being collected and bound into a large volume of miscellaneous historical material from the seventeenth century. A Catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts in the British Museum (1808), II, 608, is vague as to the origin of this manuscript. C. E. Wright, Fontes Harleiani (1972), pp. 80, 393, traces the manuscript volume no farther than the Harley library at Brampton Bryan, the family residence. The text is in two different hands. The first section, comprising about one-fourth of the text, consists of ff. 134-168, in a mid-seventeenth-century secretary hand, on laid paper, measuring 310 x 200 mm. In the same hand a title-page is given on f. 134 r of this section: "[in roman script] A Supply or an Addition to | the Catalogue of Bishops | to the yeare M. DC. VIIJ." Written directly below the title, in a hand identified in the Catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts as that of Robert Harley himself, is the following note: "By Sr John Harrington | written for the service | of Prince Henry and | Printed in smal octavo | 16[blank]." Ff. 134-168 r include the sections on Canterbury, London, Winchester, and the beginning seven lines on Ely, which are repeated in the opening of the second section. Following f. 168 v , which is blank except for the running title "Martin Heaton," is an unnumbered blank leaf. The second section, ff. 169-248, begins with the section on Ely and contains the remaining three-fourths of the text of the Supplie , complete. Of particular significance, however, are the additional eight pages of the text of "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand," ff. 245-248, which it contains, a passage of text which appears nowhere else. The second section of the manuscript is written on sized linen pages, measuring 330 x 210 mm., in an early seventeenth-century secretary hand. Most likely the manuscript existed complete in this earlier hand at one time. Neither section is carefully copied; both reveal a certain rapidity in the copying, and contain extensive abbreviations and numerous errors. The additional section of the "occasion," ff. 245-248, was undoubtedly part of Harington's original version, which he excised before preparing FC for Prince Henry. In FC , p. 185.7, Harington indicates his intention to continue the "occasion" with a fuller discussion of the matter of episcopacy in an added chapter: ". . . that [the Christian religion] hath beene preserved and continued with Bishops, and that it will fall and decay without Bishops, as in ['the next Chapter' del. ] *some other tretis [ interl. ] I will god willing more speacially prove." As indicated, in FC the phrase "the next Chapter" has been cancelled and the phrase "some other tretis" written above it in Harington's hand. The H MS. carries the original reading, "the next chapter," on f. 243 v . Apparently Harington had plans for a fuller religious treatise than the one he presented to Prince Henry. It is clear from the copyist's note at the end of H , f. 248 v , " desunt reliqua ," that the manuscript from which H was copied must itself have been incomplete. Since the "occasion" is lacking in all other texts but H , FC , and NA3 , it is difficult to know precisely when or how the excision was made or to know how much material may have been excised. The text of this new section is provided in Appendix III. The last manuscript located to date is B.M. Sloane MS. 1675, a quarto volume in an eighteenth-century binding of brown calf with a red spine tooled in gold, measuring 212 x 154 mm. The front and back boards contain the Sloane arms within a gold triple-rule frame. Endpapers are marbled. The pages have been trimmed so that the original manuscript foliations have been cut away from the earlier pages. The manuscript contains two sets of numbers, foliation appearing on rectos in red ink, and pagination on versos in black. At the top of f. 1 r is the title: "A Supplie or an Addition to the | Catalogue of Byshops to the yeare | 1608." The text follows, ff. 1-71, with f. 72 blank. It contains the text of the Supplie proper but lacks "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand." The hand, which is consistent throughout, is mid- to late-seventeenth-century cursive, the writing a bit rough and hurried, with frequent mistakes and numerous misreadings. According to A Catalogue of the Manuscripts Preserved in the British Museum , Hitherto Undescribed . . ., ed. Samuel Ayscough (1782), s.v. Sloane MS. 1675, this manuscript came from the library of Moses Pitt, the seventeenth-century printer, though no information as to its earlier history is given. B.M. Sloane MS. 1674, a catalogue of Pitt's books, contains no record of it, and the more recent Index to the Sloane Manuscripts in the British Museum (1904), pp. 240, 423, gives no additional information about it. Collation of these two manuscripts with the other texts, manuscript and printed, and the existence within H , ff. 245-248, of textual matter not present in any other text, show clearly that they both descend from some manuscript text of a different origin from A . They differ markedly in their readings from the other texts, and though they share a large number of readings, the considerable number of variants between them, 1166 in total, and the absence of the expanded "occasion" from S indicate that the latter, S , is not descended from the earlier, H . On the other hand, their relationship cannot be disputed. FC disagrees with shared substantive readings in H and S in 876 instances; no other combination of texts shares such a high number of variants from FC . It is rivaled only by BV-NA2 , which shares 604 variants from FC . Though H and S are most closely related, S is definitely far removed from all texts, because of its manifold errors, as the data below indicate: Substantive Variants : H, S, and Other Texts H-FC 1453 H-A 1550 H-S 1166 H-BV 1842 H-NA1 * 298 H-NA2 1901 H-NA3 1497 S-FC 1543 S-A 1654 S-H 1166 S-BV 1891 S-NA1 * 274 S-NA2 1943 S-NA3 1600 S is definitely the work of a careless and hasty copyist, but the second section of H (ff. 169-248), dating as early as it does, provides us with a version of the text that must be considered close to Harington's original draft. In any case, both manuscripts represent a version of the text in a form that predates the text of A . At Harington's death in 1612 the Supplie still remained for all purposes a relatively private work, a "courtly" history, seen only by a few. It was not until 1653 that John Chetwind, a presbyterian grandson of Harington's, had the history published in duodecimo under the title, A Briefe View of the State of the Church of England , and consequently gave it its widest audience. 11 It is rather shocking to know that the conservative Harington, an Anglican with Catholic proclivities, would ultimately have his anti-puritan history brought before the public by a presbyterian grandson, and this peculiar circumstance has affected the judgment that has been made of the Supplie ever since. Chetwind was the son of Dr. Edward Chetwind, chaplain to Queen Anne and the Dean of Bristol Cathedral, and of Helena Harington Chetwind, Sir John's eldest daughter. He was born at Banwell, Somerset, on 4 January 1623, was educated at Oxford, and, according to Alsager Vian's account of him in the DNB (s.v. Chetwynd), "threw in his lot with the presbyterians, seemingly at the instigation of his uncle John Harington [Sir John's eldest son]." Harington's namesake had deserted his father's position and turned parliamentarian, in spite of his father's views on monarchy and episcopacy. Perhaps like other Haringtons in the past, especially his own father, he noticed the changing winds. In any case the grandson Chetwind continued a presbyterian and during the Interregnum held the position of joint-pastor of St. Cuthbert's parish in Wells. F. J. Poynton tells us that he preached the funeral sermon of Rev. Samuel Cooke at Wrington Church, Wells, on 12 August 1652, and that his views "inclined to the Puritans." 12 It was during this time, in 1653, that he published the Supplie , at a time in his life when, according to Wood, he was "no friend to the church of England" ( Athenae , IV, 376). Chetwind may have come into possession of a manuscript of the Supplie through his uncle John Harington. 13 Sir John's own death preceded Chetwind's birth by eleven years, so a copy could not have come to him directly. He and his uncle were apparently inclined to similar religious attitudes and got along well together. Their friendship is attested to by John Harington's diary, B.M. Add. MS. 10114, kept by him from 31 March 1646 to about Christmas 1653, in which Harington mentions having Chetwind to dinner on occasion and attending his sermons, though he makes no mention of the Supplie . As far as can be determined, if we can judge from the number of extant copies of the Briefe View (it is more accessible than the eighteenth-century editions of the Nugae Antiquae ), the work was very popular and gained a much undeserved reputation as a good anti-episcopal tract. Anthony à Wood, in his account of Francis Godwin, is the first to comment: "But so it was, that the book coming into the hands of one John Chetwind , (Grandson by a daughter to the author,) a person deeply principled in presbyterian tenants, did, when the Press was open, print it at London 1653 in oct. And no sooner was it published, and came to the hands of many, but t'was exceedingly clamour'd at by the Loyal and orthodox clergy, condemning him much that published it . . . yet it was exceedingly pleasing to the Presbyterians and other Dissenters" ( Athenae , II, 557). The text of this edition lacks the last twelve lines of the conclusion ( NA3 , II, 278.1-12) and "The occasion why the former worke was taken in hand" ( NA3 , II, 3-12). Although the latter section is lacking in BV , its title-page quotes the "offending distich" on Henry VIII and Henry IX from that section of the Supplie (see NA3 , II, 3), which would indicate that Chetwind had access to it and chose not to include it. Chetwind's edition is descended from A ; of all the manuscript texts available, this particular text resembles the printed book most closely. However, it is clear that A did not serve as actual copy for this edition, since A is free of printer's marks, and since BV contains thirty-seven substantive readings found in the other manuscripts but not found in A . The readings appear in the last five sections of the Supplie ; they are minor and are largely corrections of errors in A . For example, at two places in A , lacunae exist (30 v .24-25 and 33 v .8), which are completed in FC and H , the other two manuscripts that predate BV . The perfected readings appear also in BV , which indicates that Chetwind used a text that was close to A but more complete, or that he himself made a transcript of A , which was then corrected through comparison of it with some other text. Two extensive readings in BV have no source in any extant manuscript. At the beginning of the account of John White of Winchester, p. 59, BV reads, "He was born of a worshipfull house, and in the Diocess of Winchester , and became after Warden of Winchester , thence for his great learning and vertuous life prefer'd to the Bishoprick of Lincoln , and after upon the death of Stephen Gardner made Bishop of Winchester; wherefore of him I may say and so would all men say (how contrary soever to him in religion . . ." For the same opening, the manuscripts agree, reading simply, "Of him I may say . . ." In the account of Lancelot Andrewes, BV , p. 141, a lacuna existing in both A and FC is perfected in BV with the insertion, "born in London, and trained up in the School of that famous Mulcaster ." H and S contain neither the lacuna nor the reading. These readings may have been inserted by Chetwind himself, or they may have come from a text available to Chetwind at the time. Of all the printed editions, BV is the one most responsible for substantive textual changes, since it introduces readings that become perpetuated in the Henry Harington editions of the Nugae Antiquae of 1769 and 1779 and the second issue of the latter edition in 1792. Some errors were corrected in the two editions (1769, 1779), but many went uncorrected until Thomas Park's edition of the Nugae in 1804. In 1769 the first volume of the first edition of the Nugae Antiquae was published by Henry Harington, the son of Dr. Henry Harington of Bath. This edition is referred to as NAI . It contains only the section of Bath and Wells, published in the form of a letter from Sir John to Prince Henry, which occupies pp. 5-27 of the first volume of that edition; the second volume did not appear until 1775. Since the section on Bath and Wells is missing from A , it is possible that NAI was set directly from leaves of the manuscript, which were destroyed in the process. Henry Harington, then a boy of fourteen when this volume appeared, may have destroyed a number of manuscripts in preparing this edition (see n. 7). Since the leaves from A are lacking, it is impossible to say with certainty. NAI follows faithfully the readings from BV and may have been set from BV , and the leaves from A may have disappeared in some other manner. In any case, NAI has no textual relation to FC , H , or S . A subsequent edition of the Nugae appeared in 1779, also edited by Henry Harington, in three volumes; it contains the full BV text of the Supplie in Vol. I, pp. 1-246. Text is hereafter cited as NA2 . This edition contains the second complete printed text, and collation shows that it was set from a copy of BV . In addition to containing the errors and omissions of BV , it introduces new readings and new errors, so that of the three printed editions of the complete Supplie it is the least authoritative. Unfortunately, the perpetuation of its faulty text has now been facilitated by a photo-reproduced facsimile issued in 1968 by Georg Olms Verlagsbuch-handlung of Hildesheim, Germany, No. 14 in its Anglistica &amp; Americana series. What has been thought to have been a new edition of the Nugae appeared in 1792, in three volumes, but an examination of the Folger copy of this date and a comparison of it with a copy of the 1779 edition establishes that it is a new issue made up of remainder sheets of the 1779 edition with a cancel title-page bearing the 1792 date. The preliminaries of the first volume of this copy of the 1792 issue are arranged so that the dedication to the Bishop of Bath appears before the account of Sir John Harington, the anecdote on the repairing of the church, and the short poem, whereas in the 1779 edition, it follows them. Otherwise the 1792 issue is identical to the 1779 edition and therefore has no new bearing on the text of the Supplie . The most recent edition of the Nugae appeared in 1804 in two volumes, edited by Thomas Park; it contains the entire Supplie in Volume II, pp. 1-278. Park's edition is textually unique in that, as he states in Vol. I, pp. xx-xxi, his edition was set from FC and is the only printed edition to date to use the fair-copy manuscript as its copy-text. As a result it is more authoritative than any previous printed edition. Park's editorial principles, however, were inconsistent. He abandoned Harington's fairly regular practice of punctuation and spelling and substituted his own, a system that is less consistent, more complicated, and less clear than Harington's. In eighty-six places in the text, he chose to emend FC freely with substantive readings from BV , where those readings seemed better, to his judgment. Marginal notations by Harington were taken over by Park and used as editorial footnotes to the text. Throughout both A and FC there are lacunae in the text which Harington intended to fill but never did, spaces which usually were meant to contain Latin or Greek quotes or factual information that he never supplied. 14 In A they occur at the following points: ff. 30 v .24-25, 34 r .10, 34 v .19-20, 56 v .18-19, and 59 r .19-20. In FC they occur at the following points: pp. 5.5-6, 7.27, 61.20-22, 64.25-26, 91.6, 119.8, 122.4-5, 166.22-23. In some places it is clear from the handwriting that a lacuna was filled at a later time (see FC , pp. 8.25, 16.3-5, 18.10-11, 21.24-25, 24.26). To fill these lacunae in his edition Park turned to BV for his readings, since apparently the other manuscripts were not known to him. At times Park indicates material taken from BV by placing it in square brackets, but he does not do so consistently. And in three instances he ignores the lacunae and closes up lines, even though the resulting readings are meaningless ( NA3 , II, 19.8, 143.15, 258.14). Since Park did not have A to refer to, he was forced to rely on the earliest extant text, BV , in spite of its inaccuracies. However, in comparison to the editions that preceded, Park's is relatively free of error. 15 The publication of Park's edition brings to a close the history of the dissemination of A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops , to the Yeare 1608 . Given the recent discovery of two manuscripts of this work, it is quite possible that others, more secluded, may surface. The prevalence of manuscripts and the survival of a large number of copies of the 1653 Briefe View attest to the popularity of Harington's survey of bishops. Further, the discovery of the eight pages of additional text in H provides us with an important addition to the Harington canon, one that confirms even more explicitly the strong pro-episcopal stance that Harington maintained throughout his life. Unfortunately, the recent re-issue by the AMS Press of Park's inadequate text of the Supplie in NA3 will probably impede the publication of a critical edition of this work in the near future, even though the discovery and examination of the autograph A MS., and of the H MS., now allow us to make some improvements in the text. 16</field>

Fuller, Wood and Strype all criticized and at the same time used it extensively as an historical source. See Fuller, Worthies , p. 500; Wood, Athenae , II, 558; and Strype, Life of Grindal (1821), p. 454. 3 Leila Parsons has discovered a record of a gift to "Sr Johne Harington" of a "ring with 32 dyamants" valued at £100, presented by Prince Henry and recorded in the Prince's privy purse accounts on 1 August 1608 ("Prince Henry [1594-1612] as a Patron of Literature," MLR , 47 [1952], 503-507). If her assumption as to the identity of Sir John Harington is correct, then Henry may have bestowed the gift in gratitude for Harington's presentation of the manuscript of the Supplie . There is, however, the possibility that the gift may have been presented to Henry's close friend and personal companion, then also Sir John Harington, but of Exton, later second Lord Harington of Exton (d. 1614), shortly before his journey to Italy in 1609. See Ian Grimble, The Harington Family (1957), pp. 154-163, for a full account of this contemporary of Sir John's, who is often confused with him. 4 Though Park's edition of the Nugae contains the only widely-available text, in its modern reprinting by the AMS Press of New York (1966), it is not accurate, as I show below. (These and other cross references that follow are to the pages of my typescript.) All direct quotes from the Supplie are taken from FC and cited by page number, and a citation is also provided from Park's more available text in NA3 , to the passage where it appears in his edition, thus: FC , p. 178; NA3 , II, 277. 5 A full account is given in her article, "The Harington Manuscript at Arundel Castle and Related Documents," Library , 4th Ser., 15 (1934), 388-444.

Wood, Athenae , IV, 376, says that the Supplie was also published abroad, a statement I have not been able to confirm. The seriatim signing of the book, A 6 (—A 6 ) B-K 12 , suggests the possibility that Kirton may have been setting from printed copy. On the other hand the excision of leaf A 6 suggests equally that gathering A was reserved for preliminaries, and was set last. 12 Poynton's collection contains extensive material on the Chetwinds. See Memoranda . . . Relating to the Parish of Kelston , in the County of Somerset (1878), Pt. III, 19-20. 13 The most complete account of John Harington the son is given in Grimble, pp. 178 ff. 14 Elizabeth Donno finds the same practice in B.M. Add. MS. 46368, "The Metamorphosis of Ajax," where Harington left lacunae for psalm numbers, and for a line of Latin ( The Metamorphosis of Ajax [1962], pp. 14-15). 15 NA3 is the last complete published text of the Supplie , but excerpts from it were printed in nineteenth-century editions relating to the bishops; they were taken from NA3 , however, not from earlier texts. S. H. Cassan reprinted a full text of the section on Oliver King of Bath and Wells in Lives of the Bishops of Bath and Wells (1829), pp. 317-325. James Bliss, in his edition of Two Answers to Cardinal Perron , and Other Miscellaneous Works of Lancelot Andrewes (1854), XI, xxxv-xxxviii, prints Harington's remembrance of Andrewes, with some explanatory notes. 16 An historical collation of all substantive variants among the texts is available from me at the University of Louisville, on request. * Text of NAI contains only section of Bath and Wells.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Middleburg Psalms by Nicholas Temperley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From time to time, in the seventeenth century, the records of the London Stationers' Company mention 'Middleburg Psalms' (the spelling varies). Thus on 17 February 1623 we find a list of various formats and styles of Sternhold and Hopkins's Whole Book of Psalms , for binding up with George Wither's Hymns and Songs of the Church . Among others the following are listed. 1 sixteene Middleborough sixteene common octavo Middleborough octavo Nonparel octavo common Again, on 7 September 1635 the Court of Assistants of the Company rebuked William Stansby for incompetent printing of an edition of the metrical psalms; the Minute 2 continues: "And whereas the said Mr. Stansby hath the Middleborough Psalmes to print It is ordered he shall not go forward with them." The earliest surviving Stock Books, containing inventories of the books in the Treasurer's Warehouse, begin on 1 March 1663. 3 In them we find 'Middleburg psalms', 8vo and 16mo, included in the annual inventory, each year until the destruction of the entire stock by the Great Fire of September 1666. After that we meet with the term no more. It seems then that Middleburg Psalms were a kind of psalm book, distinguished in some feature from others of the same format. What did the term mean? Middleburg, of course, was the town in Holland from which a great deal of English Puritan literature had been printed and distributed illegally in England and Scotland, notably by Richard Schilders between 1579 and 1616. 4 Schilders did print metrical psalms (see Table 1). But the term cannot mean 'Psalms printed at Middleburg', because it was used for editions printed in London on behalf of the Stationers. Among the products of the Schilders press were several editions of the Scottish psalms. William Jackson therefore conjectured that 'Middleburg Psalms' were Scottish psalms. 5 But that will not quite make sense either. Scottish psalms were normally published in Scotland, invariably so after 1605. They were not carried by the English Stock of the Stationers' Company, and it is most unlikely that they would have been bound up with Wither's Hymns . A possible clue lies in a Court Minute of 7 September 1600: 6 Mr. Hooke declareth unto A Court holden this day: that he Receaved from m r Eldridge A m[er]chant xij books of psalters &amp; psalmes printed At Myddlebourgh by Ric' Skilders. Whereof m r Eldridge Receaved ix. back againe bound and thother iij are brought to the hall. What are 'books of psalters and psalms'? It hardly makes sense in modern idiom. But among booksellers and printers at the time 'psalter' was commonly used for the prose psalms and 'psalms' for those in metre. Mr Hooke was describing books, printed at Middleburg, that combined the two. The following year, for the first time, an edition of the English psalm book appeared 'both in prose and meeter', published in London by 'P[eter] S[hort] for the assignes of W. Seres and R. Day' (STC 2505)—in other words, by the Stationers' Company in all but name. 7 The prose version was that of the Geneva Bible, and it was printed in small type in the margins of the metrical psalms. This was a typically Puritan notion—bringing the word of God home to the singer, so that he might 'sing with understanding'; and it recalled the marginal glosses that had been a popular feature of the Geneva Bible itself. It was also a new way of attacking Anglicans, because the Genevan translation of the psalms was not the one authorised for use in church. More editions 'both in prose and metre' came out in the years that followed, the last in 1649; and it would seem natural enough that they should have been called 'Middleburg Psalms', since the original copy on which they were based had come from there. The three copies brought to Stationers' Hall were doubtless used for printers' copy. The Company had every right to take over an edition that was itself an infringement of the privilege it controlled. The connection between this prose-and-metre style and Middleburg is placed beyond doubt by an entry in the Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, dated 31 July 1599, which is described and quoted by William Cowan. It contains a license granted by the King to John Gibsoun to import a psalm book which he had caused to be printed at Middleburg. The entry bears that 'Iohne Gibsoun his hienes buik binder has upoun his awin grit charges . . . causit imprent within Middilburgh in Flanderis ane new psalme buik in litill volume contening baith the Psalmes in verse as lykwayis the samyn in prose upoun the margine thairof in ane forme nevir practizit nor devisit in any heirtofir.' The name of the actual printer is not given, and no edition has yet been discovered bearing the name of John Gibsoun. 8 Cowan goes on to identify a copy without title page at Aberdeen University 9 as being, in all probability, a copy of this edition. Another, also lacking title page, has been discovered at Dundee Public Library. 10 But it cannot well have been this edition that was brought to the London Stationers' attention in 1600. Such a book would have been called 'Scotch psalms': to the Stationers, plain 'psalms' meant Sternhold and Hopkins, English version. The two national collections, though both tracing their origins back to the psalm book published by the Geneva exiles in 1556, had diverged considerably. They were not interchangeable, nor were their texts subject to casual alteration. 11 A more likely supposition, therefore, is that Schilders printed up the 'English' psalms in the same way, and distributed them through his normal outlets in London; Mr. Eldridge bought twelve copies and sold them to Mr. Hooke, who informed the Company, and gave them three which they quickly made use of. A book of precisely this description has survived: The psalmes of David in meeter, with the prose. For use of the English church in Middelburgh. Middleburgh: R. Schilders, 1599 (STC 2499.5; copies at the British Library and New York Public Library). Like the Scottish book ordered by Gibsoun, it is 'in litill volume'—16mo in 8's. It contains all 150 psalms in the metrical versions in use in the Church of England (but without the six alternative versions customarily included), with, in smaller type, the Geneva Bible prose version alongside. At the end are the 24 additional psalms, hymns, and canticles normally included in the common psalm book, without marginal prose. There are 81 tunes in type, a larger number than any English edition of Sternhold and Hopkins had contained up to that time. The book was obviously used as copy for the 1601 edition by Peter Short, which has the same general appearance and format, identical verbal content in both metre and prose, and very nearly the same layout page by page. The only significant differences are in the tunes; these will be described later. It seems clear that the term 'Middleburg Psalms' referred to any edition of the English version of metrical psalms with prose psalms in the margin: and we may use it in that sense. It is not appropriate for the Scottish psalms. There is no reason to suppose the term was ever current in Scotland. There was no need for it there, since the prose-and-metre format became the normal one in Scotland, and was adopted for the great harmonized edition of 1635. 12 It was copied, also, for several other popular Puritan psalm books, including Henry Ainsworth's (Amsterdam, 1612). In England, only a minority of editions had the prose psalms in the margin, and it was for these that the term 'Middleburg Psalms' came to be used in the printing trade. But before tracing the history of these English editions, we may take a closer look at Schilders's prototypes. As a model for his remarkably popular innovation, Schilders looked to certain editions of the French metrical psalter. As early as 1561 a Paris edition of Marot and de Bèze's version had appeared with marginal prose; the title page explained: nous avons mis a l'opposite de la rime, les vers en prose, de la traduction de feu M. Lois Bude: correspondant l'un a l'autre selon les nombres, verset pour verset. 13 Several later editions appeared 'avec la prose en marge'. Before 1594 Schilders's liturgical books in English had been for the Brownists and other separatists living on the Continent. In 1594 he had printed an edition of metrical psalms for the Scottish church, containing some innovations. Now, in 1599, he tried to penetrate the far more lucrative English market. The two 1599 editions, one for Scotland, the other ostensibly 'for the use of the English church in Middelburgh', are quite similar in appearance, and on closer inspection it emerges that many parts of them are actually identical. Schilders in fact reimposed those parts of the type that could be used for both books. For example the whole of quires A, B and C (excluding the title page from consideration), and the first five leaves of quire D, are the same in both books apart from minor details; there are dozens of other complete pages that are the same, and many others again in which some part of the page has been reimposed. The metrical psalm texts, however, have been very carefully revised in otherwise identical sections of type. Slight textual variants, differences between Scottish and English spelling ( gude/good, quhilk/which and so on) have been preserved, while the English custom of dividing up the longer psalms with subheadings ( The second part , etc.) has been followed in the 'English' edition only. Evidently the versions had become so hallowed by constant use in each country that it would have been fatal to try to change either of them. The prose version, on the other hand, is the same in both books, with 'English' spellings reflecting the popularity of the Geneva Bible in both countries. But it is not always printed from the same typesetting, since the differing lengths of some of the metrical versions necessitated different placing of the prose on the page. Which edition came first? Or were they, from the beginning, planned as a joint production? John Gibsoun claims to have commissioned the 'Scottish' book, and this would tend to indicate primacy for that edition. He might have been merely trying to claim credit for an invention that was not really his own, after paying Schilders to adapt the 'English' edition to Scottish purposes. But there is strong internal evidence that the 'Scottish' edition came first. It is to be found in the selection of tunes. Schilders had already published two editions of the Scottish psalm book, in 1594 and 1596 (STC 16584, 2701); they were substantially copied from early Scottish editions, with the important addition of eight hymns and canticles (besides the two already in use) taken from the English psalm book, and with three psalm tunes not found in earlier Scottish editions. In his 1599 'Scottish' edition, we find the same traditional texts and the same ten hymns; but, presumably as a measure of economy, the number of tunes printed with the psalms is reduced from 121 to 78. All the tunes printed except one are as in the 1594 book. We can say, therefore, that Schilders's 'Scottish' psalm book of 1599 follows the Scottish tradition, in its tunes as well as its metrical texts. The 'English' edition, however, is a very different story. Here we find that although the texts are carefully copied from the standard English psalm book, many of the tunes are foreign to that book. Twenty-eight of the psalm tunes, and all the tunes for the hymns, would be familiar to English singers—but the majority of these belong to the Scottish tradition as well. Thirty-two of the psalm tunes, however, had never appeared in an English edition with the psalms with which they were now printed. In three cases 14 they actually displaced English tunes; in eighteen cases, 15 the tune chosen was the one that appeared with the same psalm in the 'Scottish' edition. Thus Schilders evidently hoped that he could cut his costs by using some of the Scottish tunes in the 'English' edition. Despite the title page we may discount the possibility that the book was designed purely for the English congregation at Middleburg. The Separatists, who were in rebellion against the Established Church, would have had no reason to be fussy about adherence to the exact forms of the metrical psalm texts used in England. Schilders must have had the English market in mind from the first. Comparison of the type in the reimposed sections tends to confirm that the 'Scottish' edition was printed first. When Peter Short, no doubt at the behest of the Stationers' Company, brought out the first edition of the 'Middleburg Psalms' in 1601, he based it very closely on Schilders's prototype in format, layout, and texts. But he cast out all but one of the intruding Scotch tunes, and most of the other new tunes introduced by Schilders. He was naturally better informed than any Dutch printer about current English practice. Thomas East, in his harmonized psalm book of 1592, 16 had set most of the psalms to short tunes of a popular type, not to be found in the standard psalm books; and in the second edition (1594) East had written of the four most common of these tunes: 'The Psalmes are song to these 4 tunes in most churches of this Realme.' Short now substituted these tunes, and others from East's psalter, for the novelties of Schilders, and produced a book which would go into more than a dozen editions during the next forty years. But Schilders made another effort to capture the prose-and-metre market. In 1602 he printed another pair of editions, one for Scottish, the other for English use: 17 and as before, he made them as similar as possible, reimposing sections of type whever he could. Having failed to foist unfamiliar Scottish tunes on English singers, he now attempted the reverse. This time he printed the 'English' edition first, as inspection of the type shows. Taking his cue from Short's edition, he consulted the work of his old master, Thomas East. In the 'English' edition, every one of the 93 tunes was the same that East had allocated to the corresponding psalm. 18 In all other respects the book was very similar to the 1599 edition, but without the hymns. This time he made no pretence that it was for the use of the English church at Middleburg. For the parallel 'Scottish' edition of 1602, the Scottish traditional tune was in 29 cases replaced by the East tune, printed from the same type as in the 'English' edition. In 28 cases the Scottish tune was dropped and no tune substituted. Thus a Scotsman who purchased the book would find that nearly half the familiar tunes were missing. This time Schilders's drastic alterations to the tunes had some effect in both Scotland and England. At least one subsequent edition printed in Scotland was largely based on Schilders's edition of 1602, 19 while in editions that otherwise returned to the standard tunes (STC 2704 [1610], 16592 [1615], two of his tunes from England (Ps. 2, 76) were retained, as well as the marginal prose version, which became a permanent feature. The hymns introduced by Schilders in his 'Scottish' editions of 1594, 1599 and 1602 also remained part of the Scottish psalm book in most editions up to 1633. More significant is the fact that three of the twelve 'common tunes', printed separately for the first time in a Scottish edition of 1615 and destined to play a central role in Scottish psalmody from then until the present, reached the Scottish tradition through Schilders. They were three of the four tunes singled out as most popular by East in 1594, and printed many times over in Schilders's 1602 psalm books. 20 In England the tunes as well as the texts of Schilders's 1602 book were largely adopted for the first octavo edition of 'Middleburgh psalms', published by the Stationers' Company in 1605. Four psalm tunes of traditional English use, and the hymns with their tunes, were added. This edition, like its 16mo companion, was several times reprinted; but the two formats continued to exist independently, without any effort to resolve the very substantial differences in their musical content. The history of the English 'Middleburg Psalms' is relatively uncomplicated. It lasts for about fifty years. Table 2 lists all known editions. Several (perhaps all) of the editions were issued in two forms—one complete with alternative versions, 24 hymns, prayers and index, the other lacking the final gatherings containing these items. In the 16mo from 1613 onwards, all six of the alternative psalm versions from the ordinary psalm book were included. From 1625, a number of the tunes were replaced with new tunes derived from Thomas Ravenscroft's harmonized psalter of 1621. (This was also true of many ordinary editions of Sternhold and Hopkins from 1622 onwards.) Two interesting innovations were made in the later stages. In 1635 an octavo edition appeared in which the prose version was that of the Book of Common Prayer—obviously because of the Laudian influence of the time. A High Church 'Middleburg' psalm book may seem contradictory, but its object must have been quite different from that of the first 'Middleburg' editions. Instead of helping the people to understand the metrical psalms, it was designed to familiarize them with the prose psalms, which had for many years been entirely neglected by parish congregations and left to the dreary alternation of parson and clerk. The church authorities at this time certainly hoped for congregational participation in the liturgy, including the prose psalms, and this was one way to encourage it. At the head of the prose columns was printed 'The i. Day. Morning Prayer', etc. to show the liturgical order of the psalms in Morning and Evening Prayer throughout the month, as in the prayer book. The colon in the middle of each verse was also retained, as an aid to chanting. At the same time the tunes for the metrical psalms were altogether omitted. The 16mo edition of the same year also had the Prayer Book prose version with liturgical headings, but retained the tunes. In 1644 the Book of Common Prayer was outlawed by parliamentary ordinance. The last edition of 'Middleburg' Psalms, published in 1649, effected a compromise by substituting the Authorized Version of 1611 (then known as the 'New Translation'), while the metrical texts remained unchanged. Curiously, the liturgical column headings were retained, but not the colons for chanting. At the Stationers' Company, the English Stock inventory of 1 March 1663 shows 25 octavo 'Middleburg' Psalms in stock and 94 16mo. The latter entry remained unaltered at each stocktaking until 1666, after which it disappeared. Presumably therefore no copies were sold, perhaps because the 16mo edition available still had the now obsolete Geneva Bible translation. The octavo edition, however, was still in demand. Fifty-one copies were sold between March 1663 and March 1666. To keep enough copies in stock, fifty more were brought in by the Treasurer on 11 August 1663 and another fifty on 12 March 1666. Very probably these were reprints of the 1649 edition. After the Fire, however, it was evidently not thought worth while to put an edition together again. The demand was relatively very small: ordinary 12mo psalters were selling at ten or twenty thousand copies a year at this time. 21 The Puritan wing of the clergy had been driven out of the Church by the Act of Uniformity (1662). For the post-Restoration Church, the association of the metrical psalms with the inspired word of God was perhaps less important than the association of Sternhold and Hopkins's translation with the establishment of Church and State. Hence the Middleburg format was no longer apt. As for the dissenters, they had little use for Sternhold and Hopkins; several other translations were available to them. Psalm singing had become a tedious duty, lacking in vitality, no longer embodying the fervent spirit of the early reformers. So it would remain until the rise of the voluntary parish choir at the end of the century. 22</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Marginal Rules as Evidence by Ernest W. Sullivan, II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edwin Eliott Willoughby, in The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1932), first suggested the importance of marginal-rule evidence to group printing sequences (p. 17), to determine the order of sheets (p. 42), and to detect interruptions in the printing process (p. 44). In The Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), Charlton Hinman's detailed analysis of evidence provided by "centre rules" (I, 138-150) and "box-rules" (I,154-171) 1 markedly expanded the usefulness of such evidence beyond Willoughby's original suggestions and remains by far the most thorough treatment of marginal-rule evidence; however, because the Shakespeare Folio rules are a special case, his treatment of marginal-rule evidence should not be generalized without knowledge of its limitations. Furthermore, since his comprehensive description of the Shakespeare Folio printing often utilizes many kinds of significant evidence, it does not emphasize that marginal-rule evidence alone can solve a variety of bibliographical problems or that, in some fairly common circumstances, important problems cannot be solved without such evidence. 2 Using the quarto first edition of John Donne's Biathanatos (1647), I shall discuss some kinds of problems (initial point of composition, priority of different settings of the same sheet, partial-sheet imposition, and order of imposition of preliminaries) which may require analysis of marginal-rule evidence to obtain a valid solution and will develop some guidelines for the general application of such evidence. Marginal-rule evidence occurs in three forms: (1) changes in the individual marginal rules; (2) changes in the marginal-rule skeleton, the pattern of marginal rules on a single page; and (3) changes in the rule skeleton-forme, the marginal-rule skeletons comprising an entire forme. The changes involve either a change of state or a change of arrangement, with changes of state, such as a break in a rule, the introduction of new rules into a skeleton, or of new skeletons into a skeleton-forme, generally providing the more reliable evidence. Each skeleton on every page (except sigs. ¶1-¶2 v ) of the first edition of Biathanatos contains three vertical lines (one edging the text and running list of contents, another edging the other side of the text and running list of contents and separating them from the page number and marginalia, and a third outside the page number and marginalia) plus four horizontal lines (one connecting the tops of the three vertical lines; two 10-12 mm. below this top line: the first, 85-88 mm. long, under the running list of contents and between the two vertical lines edging the text; the second, 17-18 mm. long, underneath the page number and between the two vertical lines which mark the outer edges of the text and marginal material; and one, beneath the signature and connecting the vertical line bottom ends). The compositors had twelve such basic skeletons but nearly always used eight of them in two skeleton-formes. The collation for most copies of the first edition reads: ¶ 4 (*) 2 πA 4 [A2 mis-signed g2], A-Z 4 , Aa-Dd 4 Ee 2 , 120 leaves. 3 The usual arrangement of the contents is: ¶1: [ blank ]. ¶2: Title [ verso blank ]. ¶3: Epistle Dedicatory. (*)1: List of Authors Cited. πA1: Table of Contents. C1: 'THE PREFACE.' D1: 'THE FIRST PART.' K2: ' Second Part .' V1: ' The Third Part .' Dd4: 'Conclusion.' Marginal-rule evidence is ideal for determining where composition began. In the case of Biathanatos , different running-titles on sheets ¶, (*), πA, C, and D make running-title evidence irrelevant, and the different type fonts on sheets ¶, (*), πA, and C eliminate type-face evidence except for a decision between sheets C and D, where the evidence is inconclusive. Furthermore, the assumption that composition from a manuscript would begin with the text would lead to the mistaken inference that composition began at sheet C, where Donne's argument begins with "THE PREFACE Declaring the Reasons, the Purpose, the way, and the end of the AVTHOR ." 4 A change of state in a marginal rule, however, shows that composition began at sheet D with 'THE FIRST PART.' Comparison of the various skeletons on a Hinman collator proves the sig. T1 v skeleton to be identical with that on Compositor B's 5 sig. S1 v except that the top horizontal rule on sig. T1 v has a series of very sharp bends in the first 35 mm. of its left end. Logically, of course, the mere existence of different states does not establish their printing order, and particularly with works possibly composed in a non-alphabetical sequence, great caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions about priority from such evidence; 6 however, in this case, the unbent state of the rule would certainly appear to be the earlier, and it also seems unlikely that composition would begin at sig. T1 v in a work set from manuscript. Thus, all pages (and, because the skeletons show up on each sheet, all sheets) with the sig. T1 v skeleton were printed after Compositor B composed and printed sig. S1 v . 7 Since the sig. T1 v skeleton appears in sheets T-Dd and πA, A-C, sheet C must have been imposed after sheet D, which has the unbent state of the rule (sig. D3 v ). If sheets D-R were printed alphabetically, D is the earliest sheet with the unbent state of the rule and must have been the first sheet imposed. All sheets E to R also have the rule in its unbent state, so none of them could have stood in type simultaneously with sheet D; thus, D must have been imposed before any other sheet was composed, making D the first sheet typeset. Evidence from marginal rules can solve another problem of compositional order such as the priority of variant settings of the same sheet: in Biathanatos , the order of the two settings of sheet S cannot be determined without such evidence. 8 Changes of state in skeletons and skeleton-formes establish that Compositor A reset Compositor B's setting of sheet S and that he did so after beginning, but before finishing, the composition of sheet T. Examining Compositor A's S setting in DLC copy ND 0332947, we find that he set both formes in a single skeleton-forme, 9 only two rules of which had definitely appeared in previous sheets. These two previously used rules, the top horizontal rule (characterized by a bump in the middle and a hook at the right end) on sigs. S1 and S2 and the longer middle horizontal rule (having a broken bump 17 mm. from its right end) on sigs. S1 v and S2 v , both occur on Compositor B's sig. S4 v . Since this sig. S4 v skeleton appears in sheets D-R, it must be the earlier skeleton, and those skeletons on Compositor A's sigs. S1-S2 v must have been created from its rules. Having determined the order of the settings, we can establish when the resetting took place. The fact that the rules on Compositor A's setting of S came from Compositor B's sig. S4 v skeleton implies that Compositor A began his resetting after the sheets having Compositor B's setting had been printed. Sheet T, set by Compositor A in all copies, has the same skeleton-forme as Compositor B's sheet S; 10 hence the skeletons used on all previous sheets by Compositor A as well as on sheet S by Compositor B were available to Compositor A when he began to set sheet T—why did he not use these skeletons or skeletons scavenged from them (in addition to the two rules from Compositor B's sig. S4 v skeleton), and why did he not continue using two skeleton-formes as usual? The answer to both questions is that before he reset sheet S, Compositor A had already begun composing sheet T (but had not finished it, else the rules from Compositor B's sig. S4 v which appear on his sig. T4 v would not have been available for use on his sigs. S1-S2 v ) 11 with the regularly used skeletons; thus, these skeletons (except, of course, that from sig. S4 v ) were full of type for sheet T, leaving Compositor A with fewer rules than usual, perhaps only enough to make part of a single skeleton-forme. The marginal rules, then, on sheets R, S, and T prove that Compositor A's sheet S is the resetting and that he began the resetting after he started composing sheet T and finished the resetting and its printing before he completed composing sheet T. Indeed, since both settings derive from the printer's manuscript, and are therefore not directly related textually, neither the priority of Compositor B's setting nor the time at which Compositor A's resetting occurred could be established without the marginal-rule evidence. Marginal-rule evidence, as well as running-title evidence, 12 can solve problems involving partial-sheet imposition, particularly whether half-sheets were printed together or separately. For example, collation in a normal copy of Biathantos runs ¶ 4 (*) 2 πA 4 , A-Z 4 , Aa-Dd 4 Ee 2 ; leaving the bibliographer to determine whether sigs. Ee1-Ee2 v and (*)1-(*)2 v were printed together on a single sheet or separately as half-sheets. 13 Examination of the skeletons shows that a single quarto skeleton-forme, composed of the skeletons from sigs. Dd4, Dd4 v , Dd1, and Dd1 v , was used for both formes: the outer forme contained Ee(o) and (*)(i), and the inner, Ee(i) and (*)(o). The presence of both half-sheets in each skeleton-forme proves that they were printed together on a quarto sheet. After imposition, the sheet would have been cut in half, each half folded once, and then the folded half-sheets bound in the correct place in the volume. This sequence can be easily verified: if the binder failed to cut and fold a sheet containing the above arrangement of half sheets Ee and (*) but simply folded such a sheet in normal quarto fashion, sigs. (*)1-(*)2 v would appear between sigs. Ee1 v and Ee2, as they in fact do in the copies listed in footnote thirteen. Running-title evidence could not solve this problem: the title on sigs. Dd1 and D1 v is ' Part. 3. Dist. 5. Sect. 7.'; sigs. Dd4, Dd4 v , Ee1-Ee2 v have 'Conclusion'; and sigs. (*)1-(*)2 v have no running-title. Marginal-rule evidence should prove particularly useful in determining the order of composition and printing of preliminary materials: as Hinman says, "Rules, moreover, unlike ornaments and other kinds of typographical materials [excluding type faces] that occasionally provide evidence of order, are ubiquitous" (I, 157); 14 whereas type-font and running-title variation in most preliminaries limit their use in determining order. We have seen that half sheet (*), containing the List of Authors, was printed before the other preliminary matter, so the preliminaries could not have been composed and printed in the order in which they were usually bound. The remaining preliminaries whose order remains to be ascertained include the title page and Epistle Dedicatory (sheet ¶), the Table of Contents (sheets πA, A, B) and 'THE PREFACE' (sheet C). Because these preliminaries do not occupy overlapping sheets, any order of composition would have been possible, and the final determination of order is therefore rather complex, requiring a combined analysis of rules, skeletons, and skeleton-formes. The skeleton-forme of the outer forme of sheet πA also appears on both formes of sheets A and B; hence the break 38 mm. from the left end in the top horizontal rule in the skeleton on sigs. A1, B1, and B2 proves that sheets A and B were printed after sheet πA. This same skeleton appears on sig. C1 (though the rest of the C outer skeleton-forme differs from the outer skeleton-forme on sheets πA, A, and B) with the top horizontal line unbroken, proving that the outer (and presumably, the inner) forme of sheet C was printed before any of sheet A. 15 Since a πA, C, A, B sequence would require the compositor to stop after printing one-third (sheet πA) of the Table of Contents, mix the skeletons from both skeleton-formes of sheet πA to build the sheet C skeleton-formes, set up and print the Preface, rearrange four skeletons from the sheet C skeleton-formes into their previous positions in the sheet πA outer skeleton-forme, and then compose sheet A, we can assume that sheet C was printed after sheet Ee-(*) and before sheet πA. Sheet ¶, containing the title page (sig. ¶2) and Epistle Dedicatory (sigs. ¶3-¶4 v ), has sigs. ¶1, ¶1 v , and ¶2 v blank, sig. ¶2 in a double frame of rules from the skeletons on sigs. πA3 v and πA4, sigs. ¶3 and ¶4 in the sig. g2 (πA2) skeleton, and sigs. ¶3 v and ¶4 v in the sig. πA1 v skeleton; thus, sheet ¶ was set in a single skeleton-forme composed of rules and skeletons from the sheet πA inner skeleton-forme, with sigs. ¶3 and ¶4 v imposed on one side of the quarto sheet, sigs. ¶2, ¶3 v , and ¶4 on the other, and the sheet folded in normal quarto fashion. 16 Having established the C, πA, A, B sequence and that sheet ¶ has rules and skeletons which appear in the πA inner skeleton-forme (available while sheets A and B were being printed in the πA outer skeleton-forme), one can safely conclude that sheet ¶ was composed and printed either while sheets A and B were being composed and printed or shortly thereafter. Marginal-rule evidence, then, proves that the preliminary sheets were composed and printed in the following order: Ee-(*) (List of Authors); C ('THE PREFACE'); πA, A, B (Table of Contents); and ¶ (title page, Epistle Dedicatory). Even when running-title and type-face evidence was made useless by the different running-titles and type fonts in each part of the preliminaries, marginal-rule evidence determined the printing sequence for the preliminaries in Biathanatos . Furthermore, the printing sequence strongly suggests that logic or intuition may generally be insufficient to solve such problems: one would not expect that the first sheet of the body of the text (Preface, sigs. C1-4 v ) would be printed after the last sheet of the body of the text and even after some preliminaries (List of Authors, sigs. (*)1-2 v ) or that the preliminaries listed first in the collation (title page and Epistle Dedicatory, sigs. ¶2-4 v ) would be printed simultaneously with or after the preliminaries listed last (Table of Contents, sigs. πA1-4 v , A1-B4 v ). The previous analyses primarily used evidence from changes of state in rules, skeletons, and skeleton-formes. If one exercises some caution in conjecturing priority from variant marginal-rule states, such evidence can be applied to problems of composition and imposition order in any volume. Evidence from a change in arrangement of marginal rules, skeletons, or skeleton-formes can solve the same problems exactly as evidence from changes in state did, but the less fixed the rules in the skeletons and the skeletons in the skeleton-formes, the less reliable the evidence from changes in arrangement. A rule is "fixed" in its skeleton if essentially undisturbed during the setting-up or distribution of the type; a skeleton, in its skeleton-forme, if basically unaltered during the composition, imposition, and distribution of the forme. 17 Evidence from fixed rules and skeletons can, under certain conditions, identify pages or formes in the same printing sequences: sheets in alphabetical sequence having one rule positioned differently than on other sheets in another alphabetical sequence implies that all sheets having one arrangement were printed before or after all those having the other. If, however, either group of sheets is not in an alphabetically continuous sequence, then evidence from changed arrangement is not conclusive: a given arrangement of marginal rules, "X," for some forme, "A," could become a different arrangement, "Y," for forme "B," and still later randomly recur in the original arrangement, "X," in forme "C," causing the unwary bibliographer to place formes A and C in the same sequence. Hinman recognized this possibility, but dismissed it on the basis of his experience with the Shakespeare Folio: "Almost never, moreover, when rules took up new positions in a given forme did they resume exactly their former positions in some later forme. Hence a given arrangement of rules serves to define a group of formes belonging to the same printing sequence: we may ordinarily [he provides two counter-examples] be quite sure, that is, that all the formes showing exactly the same arrangement of their box rules were printed either before or after all the formes that show a different arrangement" (I, 157). "Almost never" is not "never," however, and even in a work with generally fixed rules like the Shakespeare Folio, 18 evidence from changes in arrangement of rules or skeletons needs corroboration conclusively to identify printing sequences. One should always remember that the more evidence of changed rule and skeleton arrangement found in a work believed to have fixed rules and skeletons, the less reliable that evidence is. Moreover, the rules and skeletons in Biathanatos show that Hinman's affirmation of the reliability of evidence from changes in arrangement should not be generalized to works having partially fixed rules and skeletons. Previous discussion has shown that Compositor B's sheet S, Compositor A's sheet S, and Compositor A's sheet T belong to three separate printing sequences. The fact that the skeleton from Compositor B's sig. S4 v appears on Compositor A's sig. T4 v , then, proves that identical rule arrangements on pages in works with partially fixed rules and skeletons need not imply membership in a single printing sequence. Indeed, the number of rules and steps involved in Compositor A's tearing down Compositor B's sig. S4 v skeleton to construct skeletons for sigs. S1-S2 v and then dismantling them to build his sig. T4 v skeleton make the odds against identical arrangements in the two skeletons high enough that one could speculate that Compositor A deliberately made his sig. T4 v skeleton look like Compositor B's sig. S4 v skeleton. Just as identical arrangements of marginal rules can exist on pages belonging to different printing sequences in a work with partially fixed rules, so can identical arrangements of skeletons in skeleton-formes exist on formes belonging to different printing sequences, as the skeletons on sheets E to S in Biathanatos will show. The skeleton arrangement in the E outer skeleton-forme also appears in the F inner skeleton-forme and that in the E inner skeleton-forme in the outer of F. This skeleton arrangement continues through sheet O, but the skeletons are switched on P, making its arrangement of skeletons and skeleton-formes the same as that in E. The sheet P skeleton rules, however, show extensive deterioration not found in the sheet E rules but traceable in the sheets between E and P; thus E and P cannot belong to the same printing sequence. This sheet P skeleton arrangement continues through R, but when Compositor B began to work on sheet S, he reversed the sheet R skeleton-formes; as a consequence, his setting of S has the same skeleton and skeleton-forme arrangement as sheet O, but, obviously, sheets F-O and Compositor B's sheet S cannot be one printing sequence, and sheets E, P, Q, and R, another. Identical arrangements of rules, skeletons, or skeleton-formes, then, do not conclusively prove that pages, formes, or sheets having the identical arrangements belong to a single printing sequence in works with partially fixed rules, skeletons, and skeleton-formes. Even though it requires certain precautions, evidence from changes in state or arrangement of marginal rules, skeletons, and skeleton-formes can be extremely useful not only because it may prove helpful or even necessary in solving a variety of problems, but also because it is readily available. Frequently, such evidence is immediately obvious to the unaided eye, but even very slight variations can usually be detected with a Hinman collator. If the analysis involves only a single volume or if the bibliographer cannot gain access to physical copies of necessary volumes, xerox copyflow made from microfilm as described in George Guffey's article, "Standardization of Photographic Reproductions for Mechanical Collation," PBSA , 62 (1968), 237-240, and used on a Hinman collator is sufficiently accurate to perform any of the marginal rule analyses in this discussion. 19</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Hinman's terms, "centre rules" (which run vertically down the page center between two columns of text) and "box rules" (surrounding the running-titles and text), derive from James S. Streck's article, "Center Rules in Folio Printing: A New Kind of Bibliographical Evidence," SB , 1 (1948-49), 188-191. Streck proves that the "center lines," unlike the "box rules," are not an integral part of the skeleton-forme in the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio; Hinman proves the same for the Shakespeare Folio. The Streck and Hinman terminology, however, is inappropriate for a general theory of marginal-rule evidence: it describes only a single arrangement of rules in works having some rules occasionally distributed with the type and others usually fixed in the skeleton, and the implication that rules surrounding the text were used differently from those in the body of the text could be seriously misleading—even in the two Folios, any given center rule usually appears with the same box rules, and the box rules are frequently not part of the skeleton-forme. In an effort to develop a more general approach, I shall treat all rules simultaneously and so have named them for their usual function, indicating a margin of some sort. 2 For example, Guy A. Battle, in "The Case of the Altered 'C'—A Bibliographical Problem in the Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio," PBSA , 42 (1948), 66-70, shows that marginal rules may be more reliable than running-titles in tracing skeletons and in "A Bibliographical Note from the Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio," SB , 1 (1948-49), 187-188, that in at least one instance rule evidence could determine the printing order of formes on a sheet. 3 Two issues of the first edition exist differentiated by a cancel title page. Copies with their sheets bound differently are listed in footnote 13. 4 Ordinarily, one would expect material identified as "THE PREFACE" to be part of the preliminaries, and, indeed, the compositor began at sig. D1 (see below) with "THE FIRST PART. OF LAW and Nature ," showing that he initially considered "THE PREFACE" part of the preliminaries. The Table of Contents, however, lists "THE PREFACE" as the first part of the text. Furthermore, the unusual signing of the sheets in the Table of Contents (πA, A, B) and the pagination beginning on the second sheet of the Table of Contents at sig. A1 strongly suggest that the compositor realized that sheet C, containing "THE PREFACE," was not part of the preliminaries before he began setting the Table of Contents: when the compositor signed his first sheet 'D' and numbered its first page '25', he planned to sign and number the pages of three sheets (a perfect calculation for the Table of Contents) as part of the regular sequence of signatures and page numbers, but when he realized that "THE PREFACE" (which happened to fill exactly one sheet, C) began the text, he had to move the Table of Contents back one sheet, designating its first sheet 'A' (signed in italic) and beginning pagination on its ninth page. This initial confusion of the status of "THE PREFACE" also answers the query of Geoffrey Keynes as to why "The pagination begins very oddly on the fifth leaf of the Contents list" ( A Bibliography of Dr. John Donne , 4th ed. [1973], p. 119). 5 Two settings of sheet S exist: Compositor A set all of the sheets in the Library of Congress (DLC) copy ND 0332947 and every sheet except S in all other copies of Biathanatos with which I am familiar; Compositor B set only the S sheet found in all other copies. The available evidence strongly implies that Compositor A, using the printer's manuscript, totally reset Compositor B's setting of sheet S to make the quarto stylistically uniform. Compositor B, perhaps an apprentice, in an apparent attempt to reproduce the literal appearance of the printer's manuscript, failed to indicate its intentions with respect to quotations, punctuation, and capitalization in the manner conventional in printed books with the result that his pages differ greatly in appearance from those set by Compositor A. For a complete analysis of the two settings of sheet S, see pages 136-142 of my dissertation, "A Critical, Old-spelling Edition of John Donne's Biathanatos " (UCLA, 1973), University Microfilms order #73-16,704. 6 Willoughby sounds a further warning about evidence from bent rules: "owing to . . . the ease with which they could be both bent and straightened, rules cannot furnish evidence as conclusive as type" (p. 42). Hinman, on the other hand, is quite confident about inferring priority from the mere existence of two states: "Almost invariably, moreover, it is at once quite clear which is the earlier and which the later of any two states" (I, 155-156). 7 Pages containing the sig. T1 v skeleton actually were imposed even later, after Compositor A reset sheet S; see the discussion of the order of composition of sheets S and T below. 8 Failure to consider marginal-rule evidence probably played a part in Charles Mark's incorrect ordering of these very settings in his dissertation, "John Donne: Biathanatos : A Critical Edition with Introduction and Commentary" (Princeton, 1969), pp. clxxxix-cxc. 9 The following pairs of skeletons are identical: S2 v and S1 v , S3 and S4, and S4 v and S3 v . S1 and S2 have the same rules but not in the same arrangement. 10 The one difference does not affect the validity of the analysis: the sig. S1 bottom horizontal line appears turned end for end and upside down on sig. T1, an arrangement maintained in the rest of the sheets. 11 If Compositor A had finished sheet T before resetting sheet S, these rules would have been available from sig. T4 v however, had he already finished sheet T, Compositor A surely would have used its skeleton-formes rather than introduced a new skeleton-forme with several new rules in addition to the two obtained by partially dismantling the sig. T4 v skeleton, tearing apart the new skeleton-forme after printing sheet S, and exactly rebuilding the sig. T4 v skeleton for use on sig. V4 v . Compositor A could not have returned to reset sheet S after finishing the rest of the sheets: marked deterioration in later sheets of the top horizontal rule used on sigs. S1 and S2 and longer middle horizontal rule on sigs. S1 v and S2 v eliminates any possibility that sheet S was reset after they had been printed. 12 See Fredson Bowers' article, "Running-Title Evidence for Determining Half-Sheet Imposition," SB , 1 (1948), 199-202, reprinted in Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing (1975), pp. 254-257. 13 Geoffrey Keynes's copy preserves stubs proving that sigs. (*)1-(*)2 v and Ee1-Ee2 v were imposed on the same sheet ( A Bibliography of Dr John Donne , 3rd ed. [1958], p. 93), and the following copies retain the quarto sheet intact with signatures running Ee1, Ee1 v , (*)1, (*)1 v , (*)2, (*)2 v , Ee2, Ee2 v : British Museum (George Thomason's copy), Folger Shakespeare Library, Harvard University Library (Augustus Jessopp's copy), and William Andrews Clark Memorial Library. In many cases, however, such evidence may not exist, the available copies may have been rebound, the bibliographer may not know about or have access to the necessary copies, he may have to work from photographic reproductions, or he must forego unbinding the available volumes, leaving him no recourse but marginal-rule evidence. Even in our case, marginal-rule evidence is necessary to reconstruct completely the processing of this sheet. 14 Biathanatos demonstrates this ubiquity: even though its preliminaries do not require skeletons (pagination does not even begin until sig. A1, and the preliminaries lack marginalia), they appear on every printed page except the title page. 15 Since the break does not appear in the top horizontal line on sig. A2, the marginal-rule evidence does not prove that the inner forme of A could not have been printed before sheet C, but this possibility seems rather remote: the compositor would have had to stop in the middle of the Table of Contents, arrange the sheet A skeletons plus four other skeletons into the sheet C skeleton-formes, compose and print the Preface, dismantle the sheet C skeleton-formes, rebuild the skeleton-forme for sheet A, and return to composing the Table of Contents, all for no reason. 16 With ¶1, ¶1 v , and ¶2 v blank and ¶2 unsigned, one might think that the title page was printed on a separate sheet, but the rules prove that it and the Epistle Dedicatory were printed on a single sheet in the first issue of Biathanatos (which has the undated title page—the second issue carries a 1648 date). Significantly, the presence of the rules from sigs. πA3 v and πA4 on the undated title page and the absence of any rules from other pages of Biathanatos on the 1648 title page establishes the priority of the undated title page and the order of the issues. As in the case of the Ee-(*) sheet, proof that the undated title page was printed as a single sheet with the Epistle Dedicatory is simple, given access to appropriate copies, but for a bibliographer working with rebound copies or photographic reproductions, the marginal-rule evidence is essential. 17 Marginal rules tend to become fixed for the same reasons running-titles do: "The convenience of using the same skeleton in different formes for speed and for consistency of register (instead of constructing a new skeleton for each forme of the book) made the running-title in effect a part of the furniture" (Fredson Bowers, "Notes on Running-Titles as Bibliographical Evidence," The Library , 4th ser., 19 [1938], 316). 18 Hinman concludes that the Shakespeare Folio box rules were part of the skeletons (I, 153) and that these skeletons were unaffected by composition and distribution, so that the box rules were fixed: "The components of this skeleton were not only then transferred directly from the old forme to the new but were placed in exactly the same relative positions in the new forme that they had occupied in the old" (I, 156). 19 To insure reliability, the dimensions of the copyflow reproduction should be checked by comparing the reproduction with a physical copy on a Hinman collator.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Texts of Marvell's Satires by A. S. G. Edwards and R. M. Schuler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Debate on the text of Andrew Marvell's political poems seems to have been stilled by the combined labours of Lord and Margoliouth/Legouis, 1 to whom all students owe a fundamental debt. Yet, indispensable though their work is, it falls short of definitiveness in at least one respect. Neither editor seems to have been aware of an important manuscript authority in Princeton University Library, containing hitherto unexamined, indeed unidentified, texts of some of Marvell's political satires from the early 1670's. The following examination, both of the manuscript and of the Marvell texts it contains, suggests that the Princeton manuscript may be of significance in establishing the text of certain of these verse satires. Princeton MS. AM 14401 (henceforward P) is a small (6” x 8”) paper manuscript of 417 pages. It contains (among others) texts of poems by Oldham, Rochester, Crashaw and Sedley as well as the two earliest substantial erotic works in English, the verse play Sodom (in two versions) and a prose translation from the Latin of part of Choirier's Satyra Sotadica . 2 It also includes texts of five of Marvell's political poems: "Britannia and Rawleigh," "[Further] Advice to a Painter," the first part of "Nostradamus' Prophecy," "Bludius et Corona," and part of "The Loyall Scot." There are virtually no clues as to the provenance of this manuscript. The hands of only two scribes appear in it, the second of whom wrote all the Marvell poems. Neither the hands nor the general appearance of the manuscript suggests that it was the product of a professional scriptorium. It seems rather to have been a private compilation assembled piecemeal over a period of some years. From internal evidence it seems probable that the period of compilation was the late 1670's-early 1680's. 3 Nothing further is known about its history until its acquisition by Princeton University Library in April, 1951, from Rosenbach for $525.00. 4 The obvious interest of any new manuscript of this kind lies in the nature of the new readings it reveals. In the notes that follow all substantive variants from Margoliouth/Legouis's standard text of Marvell have been noted and then compared in turn with the full manuscript collations in Lord. i) The Loyall Scott (pp. 362-363): text in Margoliouth/Legouis pp. 184-185, full collations in Lord, p. 458. This extract from The Loyall Scott , comprising ll. 178-185, also appears separately in MSS. Douce 357, B.L. Add. 23722, and Sloane 3413. The full list of variant readings from the standard text follows: 178. to have his rents] his rents to have 181. that Robs] to rob 183. spared] saved None of these variants is recorded in Margoliouth/Legouis or Lord. ii) Bludius et Corona (pp. 361-362): text in Margoliouth/Legouis, p. 178; not included in Lord. This is a Latin version of (i) above. The only variants are 1. ruris] meus 5. ast] ut 7. texisset] sumpsisset iii) [ Further ] Advice to a Painter (pp. 325-332): text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 176-177, full collations in Lord, pp. 456-457. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 3. There] here 3. here] there 5. Roman] Romanes 6. Brittain] Brittaines 7. Whilest] Thus 7. with the work] in ye coach 12. a] the 12.

The omission of ll. 25-26 does occur in a number of other copies (All Souls Codrington 116; Bodleian Don.b.8; B.L. Add. 23722; and Osborn Chest II, nos. 3 and 13). In addition, B.L. Add. 23722 includes the same variants at ll. 29 and 48 (the latter also occurring in Osborn Chest II, no. 13). The only other variant P shares with the recorded manuscripts is at l. 35. There is, therefore, insufficient evidence on the basis of the variant readings to suggest a close relationship between P and any of the other manuscripts. iv) Nostradamus' Prophecy , ll. 1-34 (pp. 367-371): text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 178-179, collations in Lord, p. 459. No other manuscript or printed text appears to contain only the first part of this poem. The full list of variants follows: 3. Fireballs] firebrands 5. the] y t 10. Hir'd] and 11. those] these 14. dores] door 15. parts] part 17. Premier] Prime 21. And] When 24. but] both 30. the] lord 31. will] shall Once again the variants show little significant connection with other manuscripts. Two variants, those at ll. 3 and 17, occur in Osborn Chest II, no. 13. But there is no other agreement with extant manuscripts. v) Britannia and Rawleigh (pp. 279-299): text in Margoliouth/Legouis, pp. 194-199, collations in Lord, pp. 464-465. The full list of variant readings is as follows: 3.

Fortunate] adds &amp; 194. ground] earth More so than with the other Marvell texts under consideration, the P copy of Britannia and Rawleigh shows extensive variation from the standard text, comprising seventy-six substantive variants in the 194 lines. Of these, eight show some agreement with the nine recorded manuscripts, but even here no coherent pattern of relation emerges: in two cases (ll. 68, 92), P's variant appears in all texts, and in two more (ll. 24 'martyrd', 39) P shares a reading with Bodleian Don.b.8, although l. 39 also agrees with Taylor 1, B.L. Harl. 7315, and B.L. Harl. 7317. The latter manuscript then joins two early printed versions (Lord's e and m , printed 1689 and 1697, respectively) in a single agreement with P at l. 113. Other single agreements are found with B.L. Add. 23722 (l. 19) and with Bodleian Eng. Poet. d.49 (l. 76). Finally, in a single instance (l. 10), P agrees with all manuscripts except Douce 357. Even in the few cases in which there is agreement with other texts, then, P shows no consistent connection with any of them. An examination of all seventy-five variants supplied by P makes it possible to draw certain conclusions about the P text, the most important being that in a number of respects, P seems superior to the standard text. At various points, e.g., it improves grammar and rhythm. 5 Other readings seem superior in that they seem more likely to have engendered scribal corruption than to be the product of it. 6 In broader terms, P offers a text of greater satiric force, and one that shows less expurgation or bowdlerization than the standard text. 7 An exhaustive analysis of the variant readings in P would not be appropriate here, but there is sufficient evidence to suggest that any attempt to construct a critical text of Britannia and Rawleigh would have to take serious account of the Princeton version. The interest of the Princeton manuscript extends beyond its variant readings, and other factors increase its potential significance to the student of Marvell's political poetry. It seems probable, as we have noted, that P is a fairly early manuscript, dating from the late 1670's or early 1680's. The likelihood therefore exists that its readings may be, in certain respects, significantly less corrupt than those of other extant manuscripts. This seems especially true of the text of Britannia and Rawleigh , the latest of the political satires included in P; for the poem itself was completed by early 1675 and is therefore chronologically the closest of the Marvell texts in P to the transcription of the manuscript. Moreover, the P text of Britannia and Rawleigh stands out in its extensive variations from the received texts, and some of these variations are, as our selective analysis has shown, superior to readings in the standard text. The textual superiority of P, in certain respects at least, is further supported, in that no other single extant manuscript contains all the Marvell poems in P. This fact, in conjunction with the lack of any significant textual agreement between P and other manuscripts, seems to imply that P is an independently derived collection of Marvell's satires, perhaps in some respects closer in time and relationship to Marvell's original text than many of the other surviving manuscripts. These factors combine to suggest that the Princeton manuscript has a potential importance which will invite the scrutiny of future editors of Marvell's political poems.</field>

The new reading would allow, by virtue of the similarity of its sound to that of Mack , both the meaning offered by Margoliouth/Legouis and Lord (i.e., signifying James II's reliance on Irish soldiers and his pro-Catholic stance) as well as the added contemptuousness of Muck , which meant farmyard manure, or anything filthy or disgusting ( OED ). The scatological reference three lines later ("Fiend Lauderdale, with ordure all defiles") reinforces this reading. Compare also, e.g., the variants at ll. 19, 76, where the changes seem to strengthen the satiric irony: 19. Till atheist Lauderdale shall love [rather than leave ] this Land 76.

      <field name="fulltext">Colley Cibber's comedy The Double Gallant : Or , The Sick Lady's Cure (London, [1707]) had a complicated and confused beginning—both as a play and as a printed text. Made up almost entirely of, to use Cibber's words, "what little was tolerable, in two, or three [other plays] that had no Success," 1 the play was nevertheless presented to the public by the Haymarket Company as a new entertainment. The result, as Barton Booth tells us in a letter to Aaron Hill, was most unpleasant: "as soon as the goodnatur'd Town found him out, they resented his calling [ The Double Gallant ] a new Play, and hounded it in the most outrageous Manner." 2 Cibber, despite his thick skin in matters of this sort, withdrew the play after three nights, permitted it to be revived once more three weeks later and once in February 1708, then removed it from the stage for four years. When the play was performed again in December 1712, its reception was most favorable, and it went on to become a very popular and profitable stock play. In Cibber's lifetime alone, it was performed over 165 times and went through at least seven London editions. 3 Although the play is an extraordinary specimen of the adaptor's art—"its pedigree," observed F. W. Bateson, "is indeed of quite alarming complexity" 4 —it is equally interesting as a printed document, having apparently undergone an unusually involved printing procedure. On the surface, the first edition along with its undated reissue also of 1707 5 appears to be more or less typical of a hastily printed play of the period. The collation follows a normal pattern for a quarto, running A-I 4 with the preliminaries beginning on A2 and the text beginning on the first page of gathering B. The play is divided into the usual five acts, but scene divisions are not consistently used. Stage directions, both major and minor, are usually printed in italics with the personae in the directions usually but not always printed in roman. Major directions are, of course, centered whereas minor directions are placed against the right margin or occasionally at the end of a line and set off with either single or double brackets. Speech prefixes are indented, italicized or at least partially italicized (as in 'Sir Sol. ' for Sir Solomon), and the forms of abbreviation used for the prefixes of some characters vary at times, changing from gathering to gathering and occasionally within a gathering (as 'L. Sad. ', 'La. Sad. ', or ' La. Sad. ' for Lady Sadlife). Little care was taken to enhance the appearance of the text. No ornaments, decorations, or illustrations appear. Finally there are the inevitable errors such as misspellings, wrong fonts, incorrectly attributed speech prefixes, etc. In all of these matters, The Double Gallant could hardly be considered exceptional. Closer examination, however, clearly reveals that it was printed in a surprisingly complicated manner. According to the small memorandum book kept by Bernard Lintot during this period and published in Nichols' Literary Anecdotes , Cibber sold the play to Lintot on October 27. 6 The play was then performed on Saturday, November 1, but not without some formidable competition from the Drury Lane Company. Somehow word of Cibber's plagiarism had gotten around, and on October 31, the eve of The Double Gallant 's first performance, Drury Lane performed Burnaby's The Reform'd Wife , 7 one of the principal sources of Cibber's "new" play. The Reform'd Wife was performed again on Monday, November 3, The Double Gallant's second night, and after Tuesday the Haymarket ended the embarrassing run by dropping the play. Only four days later, November 8, The Double Gallant appeared in print, 8 with a hastily written preface in which Cibber explained that, although he had "only propos'd" to call the play a "Revis'd" one, "some who had Read it were of Opinion, that the Additions in it were of Consequence enough to call it a New one" ("To the Reader," sig. A2). Lintot's haste in publishing a play that had failed so quickly—only twelve days altogether passed between the purchase and the printing of it—is perplexing, unless his intention was to capitalize on the controversy which the exposure of Cibber's plagiarism had touched off. Whatever his reasons, Lintot spared no effort in rushing the play through the presses. In order to insure that the play was published as quickly as possible, he apparently arranged to divide the manuscript into two parts and have each part printed by a different printing house. The first edition of The Double Gallant thus is actually two printed documents. The division of the manuscript for printing by two different houses is evident at the end of gathering G, where a catchword error sets up a serious mistake within the text. The last catchword of G is 'Sir', 9 the shortened speech prefix for the character Sir Solomon Sadlife. But the speech prefix for the first line of gathering H is ' La. Da. ' for the character Lady Dainty. The result of this discrepancy is that two Lady Dainty speeches come together in the text but with different speech prefixes, the last prefix of G being 'L. D. ' with ' L.D. ' also appearing at times in the gathering. The outcome, of course, is a glaring error, but from the point of view of the compositor of gathering H not entirely an illogical one. Apparently when the manuscript was divided, something happened which obscured the speech prefix for the first line of gathering H, so that the compositor of H was forced to guess what it should be. If he had had access to gathering G, he would have seen that the last two speeches of the gathering belong respectively to Sir Solomon and Lady Dainty; that information, along with the catchword 'Sir', would clearly indicate the proper prefix. Without a prefix, however, and without gathering G to help, he would logically conclude that Lady Dainty should be the speaker, since the next two speeches after the one in question belong respectively to Lady Sadlife and Lady Dainty and since the context would easily permit such a reading. In this instance, of course, we can only speculate about what actually took place, but a major error of this sort clearly demonstrates that the compositor of H did not have access to gathering G and that furthermore he was using a different prefix for a major character. For more specific evidence that sections A-G and H-L were printed at different houses, we need only examine a few mechanical details within the sections. Because watermarks are the same in all gatherings, they are of no use in distinguishing one part of the play from the other. Convincing mechanical evidence, however, can be found in the differences between headlines, press figures, and certain fonts of type which appear in the two sections. Although the style of type used in the verso and recto headlines or running titles is the same in both sections, the type is slightly larger in the headlines of H-L. Since headlines were normally reused, the adoption of a new set of headlines halfway through the printing process would obviously result in a needless waste of time in a single printing establishment. As far as press figures are concerned, we find a curious situation. In section A-G press figures appear in every gathering, and in all but gatherings A and G, the same or different figures appear once on both the inner and outer formes. 10 In section H-L, however, we find no figures at all. Again it would be most difficult to account for such a discrepancy if both sections were printed at a single house. As for differences in type, certain fonts for commas, apostrophes, and question marks are unique to section H-L. In gatherings H, I, K, and L, occasional commas and apostrophes are noticeably larger than the fonts normally used in this section or in A-G. A different type of question mark with a curved rather than angular hook (the standard font in A-G and in most of H-L) appears occasionally in gatherings H, I, and L and is the only type used in gathering K. It never appears, however, in any gathering of A-G. Yet another type of evidence can be found in the fact that the abbreviations for speech prefixes used for certain characters are different in the two sections. The characters whose prefixes change after gathering G are Lady Dainty, Lady Sadlife, Clarinda, and Sir Solomon Sadlife. Throughout A-G, Lady Dainty's prefix is either 'L. D. ' or ' L.D. ', but in H-L it is invariably ' La. Da. ' Lady Sadlife's prefix is 'La. Sad. ' in gathering C but either 'L. Sad. ' or ' L. Sad. ' in the rest of A-G; in the second section her prefix is ' La. Sad. ' in every instance. Clarinda's prefix is ' Cla. ' once in C, but in the rest of C and in D it is ' Clar. ' In H-L the prefix is exclusively ' Cla. ' Finally, Sir Solomon Sadlife's prefix is always 'Sir Sol. ' in the first section but becomes ' Sir Sol. ' in gathering H and appears as either 'Sir Sol. ' or ' Sir Sol. ' in K and L. Some variation in the abbreviation of speech prefixes, of course, is not unusual in the printed plays of this period, but the pattern of changes in The Double Gallant unmistakably points to the fact that each section was, in effect, handled independently of the other. The division of the manuscript for printing purposes apparently did not stop with the distribution of the two sections to different houses. Additional evidence in the form of numerous discrepancies in the use of catchwords would seem to indicate that the sections themselves were distributed to multiple compositors within each house. Aside from the catchword error at the end of gathering G which was discussed earlier, four other similar errors occur in the play—three in section A-G and one in H-L. And all but one of these errors occur at the end of a gathering. An examination of these discrepancies suggests the strong probability that several compositors were working simultaneously to hasten the publication of the play. The first catchword error in section A-G occurs in gathering B, within rather than at the end of the gathering. At the bottom of page 7 the catchword is 'Sir,'. But at the top of page 8 the speech prefix is 'Sir Sol. ' for the character Sir Solomon Sadlife. Because of its position within the gathering, the error is difficult to explain adequately. It may, of course, have resulted from a single compositor's oversight, or it could be that the gathering was cast off and some sort of arrangement worked out which permitted more than one compositor to work on the gathering. If the gathering were set by formes rather than serially, the error could easily have occurred, since page 7 would have been the highest numbered page of the inner forme and page 8 would have belonged to the outer forme. There is no firm evidence to prove such an arrangement, however, and the error must remain as one of the many inexplicable peculiarities in the printing of the play. The second catchword error in A-G occurs at the end of gathering C where the catchword is ' Sylv. ', the prefix for the character Sylvia. With the first appearance of this character in the gathering, the prefix is ' Syl. ', but throughout the remainder of the gathering it is ' Sylv. ' The first speech of gathering D, however, has the speech prefix ' Syl. ', which is used all through the gathering and, for that matter, the rest of the play. Another change in speech prefixes involves the character Lady Sadlife, who is identified as 'La. Sad. ' in C but consistently as 'L. Sad. ' in gathering D. A final difference within the gatherings deserves mention. In gathering C we find eight minor stage directions of the type which is placed against the right margin, and of these eight all but two are enclosed within brackets, the other two being separated by a single bracket. In gathering D there are seventeen right margin stage directions, and all but two have only the single bracket. It seems clear, thus, that two different compositors set the gatherings, each with his own preference regarding speech prefixes for Sylvia and Lady Sadlife and each with very nearly opposite preferences in the matter of setting off minor directions. The last discrepancy in the use of catchwords within this section appears at the end of gathering E. The catchword here is 'believe,'. The last line of the gathering reads as follows: ' Care. [i.e. Careless] Why truly Madam, the little Gentleman my Rival, I' and the first line of F continues: 'believe is much in the right on't.' Very probably the compositor of E, whose job was to set the catchword, either found the comma in his manuscript copy or cleverly deduced the need for one. The last sentence of his gathering, plus the knowledge that 'believe' was the next word, would clearly indicate that "I believe" was an interpolated element of the sort that is normally set off by commas in this part of the play. The compositor of F, however, working apart from gathering E (or perhaps setting his gathering at the same time E was being set), could not so easily deduce the need for a comma after just the word 'believe'. If he had found a comma in his manuscript, he would very probably have inserted it, but in the absence of one he would have found no obvious reason to do so. This catchword discrepancy, then, if these assumptions are correct, resulted very simply from the fact that the compositors were working separately or perhaps even simultaneously, each using his best judgment in the absence of a clarifying context. Further evidence that the gatherings may have been set by different compositors can be found by examining the types of dashes which are used in E and F. In gathering E, solid dashes of varying lengths are used throughout. In F, the same types of dashes are prevalent, but on five pages of the gathering (pp. 33, 37-40) they are used along with broken dashes which resemble four (and occasionally three) hyphens closely spaced. Similar broken dashes also appear on five pages of gathering G (pp. 41-43, 45, 48) but do not appear anywhere else in the play. Since gatherings F and G would probably have been the last two gatherings to be composed at this particular house, it may well be that a shortage of solid dashes was developing—a situation most likely to occur when several gatherings are being set simultaneously, since the frequently used dashes could not be redistributed. The compositor of F (and of G too, for that matter) perhaps anticipated a shortage and decided to substitute broken dashes from time to time to conserve the supply. In section H-L, aside from the error at the beginning of H discussed earlier, there is only one discrepancy in the use of catchwords. At the end of gathering H, the cacthword is ' Find. Shall' (' Find. ' being the speech prefix for the character Finder). In the first line of gathering I, the text reads ' Find [period omitted] Shah!' Since ''Shah!' is clearly the correct reading—'Shall' would have made no sense at all in the context—it is highly probable that two different compositors set the gatherings. The only other indication that multiple compositors may have been at work in H-L appears in gathering K where we find the curved question mark discussed earlier used throughout the gathering. The mark does appear, although infrequently, in the other gatherings of this section, but K is the only one where it is used exclusively. Although the evidence is more limited in this section, there seems to be no reason to suppose that H-L was not handled in much the same fashion as section A-G. The printed text of The Double Gallant thus seems clearly to have been patched together from the work of several compositors, and it was perhaps inevitable that the seams would show, especially in the critical areas where the principal sections were linked and also within the sections where certain gatherings were joined. Quite probably much of the work within each section was going on simultaneously, and it is also possible that the sections themselves were being printed at the same time or very nearly so. We need hardly be surprised, therefore, at the number and variety of mechanical discrepancies we find. When we turn our attention from the printing process itself to an examination of the accidentals, however, a remarkable fact emerges. Within the two main sections, the treatment of accidentals is more or less consistent, despite the distribution of the work to several compositors. But when we compare the sections, some significant differences come to light. In the following analysis, I have limited my examination to major differences that can be readily demonstrated. There are, of course, numerous occasional variants in the practices of the two sections which could be significant but which do not appear frequently or systematically enough to permit any sound conclusions. Many, if not most, of these differences might be attributed simply to the individual preferences of various compositors. In two areas, however—the punctuation of vocatives and the capitalization of non-substantive elements—the practices in sections A-G and H-L differ dramatically. The two sections treat vocatives in very nearly opposite ways. Up to the end of gathering G, the prevailing practice is to set off vocatives completely by commas if they come within a sentence and to separate them by a comma if they occur at the beginning or end of a sentence or just before or after a terminal mark of punctuation such as a semicolon or exclamation point. Of around 330 vocatives in A-G, about 300 are set off in these ways. For the purposes of counting, rhetorical effectiveness was not considered. Thus of the 30 or so vocatives not set off or separated, many were no doubt intentionally left alone, especially if they were preceded by an exclamation as in 'Oh my Dears', 'Oh Clerimont', or 'Ay Sir'. In section H-L the practice has been almost exactly reversed. Most vocatives are not set off at all or are only partially set off. Out of some 272 vocatives, only about 27 are punctuated in the manner which prevails in A-G. These differences were largely regularized in the true second edition of 1718 (termed "The Third Edition" on the title page). The printers of this edition, who used the first edition as the copy-text, found it necessary to make only 10 or so changes in the punctuation of vocatives in A-G, but over 225 such changes were necessary to make the practices in H-L resemble those of the first section. To demonstrate the differences in capitalization between the sections is a much more difficult task, for the differences here represent tendencies rather than clearly systematic preferences as in the case of vocatives. In general, of course, nouns are normally capitalized in both sections, and there is also a tendency in both to capitalize emphatic modifiers preceding nouns, although this practice is somewhat more obvious in H-L. In both sections we also find numerous non-substantive elements which are capitalized, but section H-L tends to capitalize such elements much more frequently. Some idea of the degree of greater frequency can be derived from the table below. Patterns of capitalization throughout the play were examined closely, and the grammatical categories listed in the table were those which were found to show significant differences. The table does not show capitalized modifiers preceding nouns, since many of the resulting combinations would have been regarded as compound nouns and thus normally capitalized. Neither does it include capitalized words which were derived from nouns or words which were capitalized because they begin independent clauses or fragmentary utterances. Finally it does not include capitalized elements which occur too infrequently to indicate any trend or minor elements which do not lend themselves to a formal classification. Elements fitting the categories listed were simply counted, and although every effort was made to assure accuracy and consistency, the figures must be regarded as approximates. It should be borne in mind that section A-G is 16 pages longer than H-L. Classification Section A-G Section H-L Adjectival Complements (All types) 11 22 66 Main Verbs 14 65 Infinitive or Participial Elements in Verb Phrases 9 38 Verbals and Verbal Elements in Verbal Phrases 22 62 The scope of the differences might be further illustrated by comparing the changes made in the true second edition which regularized and normalized the capitalization of the sections. Here we find that over 389 capitals were removed from section H-L and 37 new capitals added. In A-G, however, only 64 capitals were removed and 85 new capitals added. Admittedly data of this sort should not be too rigorously interpreted, since a different house style is likely to have its own inconsistencies. But assuming that the style of the second edition was carried out with reasonable thoroughness, the figures do show in a roughly relative way the much higher frequency of capitalized words in H-L. The two sections were apparently printed from Cibber's manuscript; this would have been the normal procedure and it would have saved considerable time. If this be the case, then it would appear that H-L was printed more or less directly from the manuscript with little or no attempt having been made to regularize Cibber's accidentals. There is a sort of undisciplined consistency in the accidentals of section H-L that could very well reflect the practices of an author who was writing at top speed without much conscious concern for consistency in mechanical matters. On the other hand, A-G would appear to be a corrected text of sorts. The compositors, or possibly a corrector employed to mark copy prior to the setting of type, would naturally have followed the house style with the inevitable result that the relatively easy job of spotting and correcting Cibber's improperly set off vocatives would have been carried out much more thoroughly than the difficult and time consuming task of regularizing his eccentric capitalization. 12 Thus the occasional passages in A-G in which capitalization resembles the practices in H-L are probably only partially regularized or overlooked passages from the manuscript itself. As for corrections at press A-G was undoubtedly corrected in at least three instances, but there is no conclusive evidence that H-L was ever corrected in any way. In six of the seven copies of the first edition or its reissue which I have examined, 13 a trivial correction of a typo has been made on page 4. 14 In five of the copies, two spelling errors on page 24 have been corrected. 15 In section H-L three different instances in which type has separated on the line and one instance of a broken font can be found in some copies but not in others. 16 But these instances are probably not evidence of correction in H-L; the lines and the font were very likely correct to begin with and the apparent errors resulted quite simply from wear and stress as the printing progressed. As far as correcting of the text is concerned, thus, both before printing and at the press, section A-G received somewhat more attention than H-L. On the basis of the evidence and of the conclusions I have endeavored to propose, I believe we can speculate with some hope for accuracy on the order of events which ultimately resulted in the curious text of The Double Gallant . First, of course, Lintot must have taken Cibber's manuscript to the house which eventually printed section A-G. There we must suppose the manuscript was at least partially cast off, marked by a corrector, or given to several compositors to compose and correct as they went along. Despite the hurried circumstances, some correction at press took place, as we have seen. Then at some point in the early stages of the preparation of A-G, Lintot decided to hasten the publication of the play by taking section H-L of the manuscript to another house. Perhaps, as I have suggested earlier, the exposure of Cibber's plagiarism and the resulting controversy spurred Lintot to take this step. Since the watermarks are the same throughout the play, it would appear that Lintot supplied the paper for both houses. At the second house the text was again distributed to multiple compositors, but for reasons we cannot now determine, the decision was made to expedite the printing by simply following Cibber's manuscript without bothering to seriously correct it or impose any sort of house style on it. The steps for correction at press seem also to have been omitted. Finally the two sections were bound together and the play offered to the public just four days after it had ended its run. 17 There are, of course, other possible explanations. Something may have happened at the first house which would have seriously delayed the printing, thus forcing Lintot to take the play to the other house. Or perhaps Lintot distributed the manuscript to the two houses from the very beginning. But the point of separation of the manuscript—in the middle of a scene and between speeches—would seem to indicate that the first section had already been cast off to that point. Whatever the case, there can be little doubt that The Double Gallant was printed in piecemeal fashion with many different men working hurriedly to complete it. As a result of this unusual procedure, the text provides us with clear evidence of the remarkably flexible printing practices of the period. And perhaps more importantly, it provides us with a unique opportunity to examine alternative approaches to the printing and especially the correcting of an author's manuscript. For the textual critic, the play poses an unusual challenge—how best to edit a play in which two very different styles are so evident. Since section H-L is probably closest to Cibber's own style, should the style of its accidentals be adopted and section A-G made to conform? This solution obviously would not do, since the style of H-L is too eccentric to admit of being copied and imposed on the other section with any hope of accuracy. For much the same reason it would be impractical to attempt to regularize the accidentals in H-L to the practices of the first section. Another alternative, the selection of the second edition of 1718 as the copy-text, would result in a text more or less consistent in the accidentals, but there is no evidence whatever that Cibber ever had anything to do with that or any other edition of the play in his lifetime. Because both sections of the first edition represent in their own way authoritative texts, each the closest we can come to Cibber's accidentals in spite of the obvious conflicts and inconsistencies, it would appear that the editor has no choice but to edit each section as he finds it. Just as Cibber took a piecemeal approach to the composing and Lintot to the printing of the play, the editor can only endeavor to preserve the pieces in their most accurate form.</field>

Subsequent bibliographies, including Montague Summers' A Bibliography of the Restoration Drama [1935], pp. 37-38, and the CBEL , also list the edition, but these citations may very well have been derived from Nicoll's list. Nicoll's entry indicates that the edition was printed in octavo and was a "2nd" edition, although a "Fourth Edition" (actually the true third edition) had appeared in 1723. Perhaps the entry could be accounted for by a volume in the British Library [643. h. (1.)] in which the undated reissue of the first edition of the play—with "The Second Edition" appearing prominently on the title page—was bound together with a dated 1729 octavo edition of Cibber's Love in a Riddle . Although the British Museum Catalogue describes The Double Gallant part of the volume as an octavo, it is clearly a quarto. 4 " The Double Gallant of Colley Cibber," RES , 1 (1925), 343. 5 The sheets of the first edition were reissued with a title page printed almost entirely from the standing type used for the first edition title page. Down to and including the rule under the words 'Written by Mr. Cibber.', the setting of type is the same for both pages. Beneath the rule the words 'The Second Edition.', in gothic type, were inserted and a new rule was placed beneath them. The imprint of the reissue was also apparently printed from standing type but was shortened by the omission of the bookseller. A period was then substituted for the semicolon which in the first edition followed Lintot's address. 6 Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (1814), VIII, 294. 7 The London Stage, 1700-1729 , ed.

Brief passages with a similar style of capitalization occasionally appear in B-G, however, and the fact that gathering A has a press figure would seem to indicate that A and B-G were printed by the same house.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Skillful merchandising was central to the extending of culture in the eighteenth century. Merchants, especially the merchants of goods which were or had been considered to be luxuries, had to discover ways of accommodating their goods to affluent middle-class buyers. The accommodations, though apparent in the goods themselves, are even more striking in the advertisements for those goods. In order to create a successful advertisement, a merchant must have a very clear idea of the projected buyers of his product. He must be sure that the advertisement will be where his buyers will look for it and that it will appeal to his buyers' motives for wanting the product. One of the most successful merchants of the mid-eighteenth century was John Newbery (1713-1767). His success was founded on the intelligent merchandising of books, periodicals, patent medicines, and cosmetics. Himself the son of a farmer and apprentice to a provincial general merchant, Newbery understood and sympathized with the motives of middle-class buyers. When he appeared, explicitly or implicitly, in his advertisements, he usually made himself out to be a benevolent man who shared the values of prospective buyers, a man who wanted to help them in their quest for worldly success. Newbery's concern to provide literature and nostrums for the middle class did not, of course, preclude his being interested in publications designed for an audience in the mainstream of aristocratic western culture, but his greatest successes, literary and medicinal, were securely middle-class. The frontispiece of The Royal Primer was capped with this verse: "He who ne'er learns his A, B, C, | Forever will a Blockhead be: | But he who to his Books inclin'd, | Will soon a golden treasure find." The "golden treasure" was not merely metaphorical; Newbery's advertisements for his children's books and for his nonjuvenile books of instruction always suggested that the goal of reading was worldly success. The title-page advertisement for Universal Harmony , one of his earliest large successes, declared that the fascicular songbook was "calculated to keep People in good Spirits, good Health, &amp; good Humour, to promote Social Friendship in all Comp ys and Universal Harmony in every Neighborhood." The improvement which even this book claimed to provide was not intangible; it was, in fact, hardly distinguishable from the improvement which a tested medicine confers. What I should like to do is to establish a scale of sophistication in advertisements, a scale ranging from completely matter-of-fact notices that given merchandise was available at Newbery's shop, to the kind of subtlety especially apparent in his advertisements for his juvenile publications. Some of the most subtle were not merely notices for his products but were also advertisements of and for himself. When he was most sucecssful, he made both his products and himself attractive to prospective buyers. Before he came up to London, Newbery published Benjamin Martin's Micrographia Nova (1742), and on each of the illustrations was this note: "These microscopes are Sold by J. NEWBERY Bookseller in Reading Berks." 1 At the end of the third edition of A Pocket Dictionary, Or, A Complete English Expositor (1765) there was a list of "Books printed for, and sold by J. NEWBERY, at the Bible and Sun, in St. Paul's Churchyard." The list included ninety-five items, probably representing almost the whole current stock of his own books. This book list was advertising of even less subtlety than the notices in Martin's book. The apparatus advertised in Micrographia Nova were immediately related to the subject of the work; the books advertised in A Pocket Dictionary were random. A dictionary, even one "Design'd for the Youth of both Sexes, the Ladies and Persons in Business," did not assume a tightly defined audience: the user might have been interested in almost any kind of reading. Since Newbery usually counted on a specific audience to read a given book, the success of most of his advertisements depended on the accuracy with which he had projected the specific interests of a specific audience. Newbery's advertisement in A Familiar Explanation of the Poetical Works of Milton (1762) was still a list, but it was considerably more digested than the random catalogue at the end of the dictionary. In publishing this work, Newbery cooperated with the illustrious Tonsons, whose names preceded his on the title page. One of the main motives for cooperation with other booksellers was the availability of advertising space in the book which they published together; in the many cooperative ventures in which Newbery engaged, notices for his books were usually prominent. Having just brought out a new edition of Milton, the Tonsons obviously intended the Familiar Explanation to capitalize on and even extend the success of that edition. Of the last four pages of the work, however, only one was devoted to their Milton. The other three were occupied by fairly extensive notices for six of Newbery's publications: (1) The Works of Anacreon, Sappho, Bion, Moschus , and Musaeus , translated by Francis Fawkes; (2) The Shrubs of Parnassus , J. Copywell; (3) Newbery's Letters on the Most Common , as well as Important Occasions in Life ; (4) A Pocket Dictionary ; (5) The New Testament . . . Adapted to the Capacities of Children ; (6) The Gentleman and Lady's KEY to Polite Literature . . . particularly adapted to the Use of Latin and French Schools . All these works were closely related to the general subjects treated in or implied by a companion to Milton. A large part of the Explanation was a very pedestrian glossary, and the fourth item in a sense simply extended it. The first two and the sixth were related to the literary aspect of the Explanation . The fifth capitalized on the religious element of Milton's works: in it, as in the sixth, Newbery assumed that parents and teachers would see Milton as part of their children's education in belles lettres . For Newbery the audience of the Explanation extended in two social directions. In one direction, the readers were already relatively cultured and would be interested in classical and contemporary poetry. In the other direction, less sophisticated readers, adult and juvenile alike, were just learning to read Milton and still needed a letter-writing manual. More exclusively defined assumptions about his audience are apparent in some of Newbery's publications of current belles lettres . At the end of Smart's Hilliad (1753) the notices were for Smart's signed poems, all thoroughly genteel and even austere works. 2 In this case the Augustan pretensions of The Hilliad itself dictated the advertisements. The advertisements for three religious poems, a Latin translation of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day , and an expensive collection all served further to dignify the work in which they were found and contributed to the vision of Smart as a moral and intelligent successor of Pope. In the same year as The Hilliad Newbery and three cooperators brought out Richard Rolt's Memoirs of the Life of the Late Right Honourable John Lindesay , a memorial celebration of the popular Scottish military officer. On the last printed page was the following advertisement for some of the same works mentioned in The Hilliad : Just published, Price 10s. 6d. Beautifully printed on Royal Paper, and embellished with curious Sculptures, POEMS on SEVERAL OCCASIONS, in LATIN and ENGLISH. By Christopher Smart, M.A. And Fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the University of CAMBRIDGE. Sold by J. NEWBERY, in St. Paul's Churchyard. Where may be had , Mr. Smart's three [Seaton] Prize-Poems on the Eternity , the Immensity , and the Omniscience of the Supreme Being ; as also, all the other Works of the same Author. Smart and Rolt were close friends; so it was natural that Rolt should want Smart's works mentioned in the Memoirs , but friendship was of secondary importance. Even more than in The Hilliad , the format of the Memoirs was presumptively aristocratic; it was an elaborately illustrated, beautifully printed, expensive (13s sewed, 15s bound) quarto. The subscription list included more national and international luminaries than the list for any of Newbery's other subscription efforts, and the wealth and status of these subscribers account for the book's very impressive format. The procedure of subscription had already established most of the audience, an audience likely to be interested in Smart's poetry, especially when his credentials were so well established in the advertisement. Again, in turn, the advertisement appears to have enhanced the aristocratic qualities of the book in which it was placed. Both The Hilliad and the Memoirs were rather more aristocratic than Newbery's usual productions. Sarah Scott's and Lady Barbara Montagu's anonymously written Millenium Hall (1762) was a kind of mean between those works and the practical books more usual for Newbery. Millenium Hall was prose fiction, but it was more explicitly improving and monitory than most of the novels we remember from the mid-eighteenth century. Women would enjoy the framed tales of other women victimized by but finally triumphant over a male aristocratic society, and parents probably applauded this cautionary fiction, expecially for their daughters. The last two pages of the book were devoted to advertising—the first of the two to another list. Here again there was care in the selection of the four works offered. The first work, The History of Mecklenburgh , was another anonymous production of Sarah Scott. Adorned with a copperplate print of the Queen, it was intended to capitalize on current interest in George III's marriage to Charlotte. The other three, A Familiar Explanation, The Art of Poetry on a New Plan , and The Idler , all suggest readers less cultured than the projected audience of The Hilliad and Rolt's Memoirs of Lindesay . The second page of advertisements is more interesting than the first. It included an extensive proposal for Newbery's Compendium of Biography and a notice for The World Display'd . The description of the Compendium opened with a direct appeal to a young audience: Mr. NEWBERY begs Leave to offer to the Young Gentlemen and Ladies of the Kingdoms, A COMPENDIUM OF BIOGRAPHY: Or. an History of the Lives of those great Personages, both Ancient and Modern, who are most worthy of their Esteem and Imitation, and the most likely to inspire their Minds with the Love of Virtue. The advertisement addressed a juvenile audience, but the beneficial effects the notice assigned to reading biography would have appealed to a parent's sense of moral utility at least as much as to a child's thirst for entertainment. The Compendium was conceived as a monthly publication, the divisions of which, the proposal asserted, would allow the buyer to discontinue subscribing and still have a self-contained whole. The advertisement concluded that the numbers would be published "the first of every month, so that Gentlemen may have them with their Magazines." Advertisements for fascicular publications frequently emphasized, as this one did, that such publications served as a kind of compromise between conventional, ephemeral periodicals and books. Although the appeals were usually limited to publications for men, Newbery did engage briefly in periodical publications for children 3 and had just concluded an experiment in publishing a magazine for women, The Lady's Museum (1760-61). What we have in this advertisement, I suggest, is a projected confluence of all three audiences: adult male, adult female, and juvenile. Newbery's Compendium imitated and would compete with Dilly's British Plutarch , which had already demonstrated the salability of serialized biography. Although the Compendium was not ultimately successful, one can see characteristic features of Newbery's merchandising here. Newbery was content with Dilly's format; the impulse of his advertisement was only to broaden the audience. Male readers, if not, strictly speaking, gentlemen, might well be interested in the work, but the projected readers of Millenium Hall were young people and rather unsophisticated women. It was toward these women and children that Newbery wanted to extend the appeal of his publication. The description of the completed World Display'd 4 emphasized purchasing details to the exclusion of any discussion of content. Because the collection had already proven its popularity, Newbery concentrated on persuading people to finish their sets of the voyages or of the travels or of both while copies of all twenty volumes were available. As in the periodical publication of the Compendium , he was emphasizing the ready accessibility of the work—here, though, without notice of its intrinsic merits. By simply mentioning The World Display'd in Millenium Hall , however, Newbery was taking a significant step. There was nothing essentially juvenile about the collection, and Newbery frequently advertised it as an important addition to any adult library. When, however, the advertisement for it appeared in a book attractive to young people, the collection became associated with Newbery's other efforts for children and young people and with his program of juvenile improvement. The advertising vehicle, in this case Millenium Hall , could modify the substance and direction of an advertisement which appeared in other contexts. 5 So far I have discussed only those advertisements which appeared explicitly as advertisements in Newbery's books. Several facts should be apparent. He obviously took care in most of his books to advertise other works which were related to the book in which they were advertised. Further, he was frequently rather vague about specifying either an adult or a juvenile audience for his publication. A great many of them would have been intellectually accessible to both audiences, and he did not want to miss any opportunity to capitalize on both. Finally, there was the reciprocal effect of the advertisement on the advertising vehicle. The advertisements in Rolt's Memoirs of Lindesay and Smart's Hilliad not only benefited from their contexts, but they also served further to define and dignify those contexts. Because propriety to the advertising vehicle was less important in newspaper advertisements than it was in books, Newbery could indiscriminately include on the same page appeals for his adult books, juvenile books, and patent medicines and cosmetics. His newspaper advertisements for books tended to be for those that were timely or practical. All the Newbery publications mentioned in the London Chronicle , for example, were utilitarian, usually to the absolute exclusion of belletristic features. The advertisements for books were almost always full or partial quotations of title pages. As the advertisements most closely related to books, title pages had been posted in booksellers' shops since the seventeenth century, and newspapers simply extended Lintot's "rubric Post" beyond the confines of his own establishment. Newbery and the five other booksellers involved in publishing The Trial of the Hon. Admiral John Byng (1757) were simply capitalizing on the popular interest in the event, but the advertisement was couched in such a way as to emphasize the book's fidelity to the facts of the case. The account was "taken by Mr. Charles Fearne, Judge Advocate of his Majesty's Fleet. Published by Order of the Right Hon. the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty at the Desire of the Court Martial." 6 The official objectivity suggested by the advertisement was offset by the sensationalism of the subject—the sensationalism on which the booksellers were relying for the success of their publication. Booksellers frequently complained that news drove out books, but they realized that news could also make books: the Trial was such an effort. It was not the sort of work which Newbery and his cooperators could expect to have much appeal after the immediate furor of the event had died down. Timeliness, then, was a restriction within which they had to work; there would be little point in advertising the pamphlet in a book likely to outlive public interest in the event. 7 Even more clearly ephemeral than potboilers were the calendar pocket books. From 1750 until his death Newbery issued yearly editions of The Ladies Compleat Pocket-Book , and his successors continued it until 1789. The advertisement for the Pocket-Book for 1758 declared that it was published "At the Request of several Ladies eminent for their Oeconomy" ( LC , 19-22 November 1757, p. 496), emphasizing first the strictly practical virtues of the book: there was space for keeping an account of money spent and received and for keeping a record of visits and random memoranda. This part appealed to practical women who had a sense of their economic and social responsibilities, but the end of the advertisement was rather less absolutely practical; the Pocket-Book included 2. The favourite new Songs sung last Summer at Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and Mary-le-bone Gardens; and twenty-four new County Dances for 1758. 3. Some Observations upon Industry and Idleness; Bill of Fare for every Month; ready Messes for Supper; Tables of Expenses; Tables for Marketing; and other Particulars very useful for the Pocket of the Fair Sex. Though anxious to emphasize the utilitarian values of the Pocket-Book , Newbery recognized a demand for something more than blank memorandum pages and bills of fare. The songs and dances met the desire of his audience—women who wanted to have some idea of what was happening in the beau monde around London. In this sense, then, Newbery was appealing to the purely social aspirations of the readers for whom he published. His readers wanted to rise in society: one mark of that rise, especially for women, was proficiency in such polite accomplishments as singing and dancing. Whether or not they went to the pleasure gardens, they wanted to know what was happening there. In view of the song-and-dance aspect of the advertisement, the reader may have been surprised by "Some Observations upon Industry and Idleness." In fact, the notice seems to have been appealing to desires for both industry and idleness. Newbery was certainly not at fault here. On the same page of the paper was an advertisement for the Dodsleys' Ladies New Memorandum Book , which was presented in a way almost identical to Newbery's notice. Although the projected readers and users of these works were women who aspired to be people of fashion or who wanted to maintain their standing in the world of fashion, they also valued industry. Whatever singing and dancing they might do, the notice implied, none of it would be at the expense of doing their duties as housewives. So far, I have restricted my discussion to advertisements as advertisements; that is, notices set off in books and newspapers so as to make it apparent that they were advertisements. Newbery did not, however, limit his puffing to clearly distinguished notices. In various ways and with varying degrees of subtlety he incorporated into the bodies of his publications themselves references to his other products and to himself. On approximately the same level of subtlety as the notices for Benjamin Martin's scientific apparatus mentioned in Micrographia Nova was this note at the end of the preface to Charles Thompson's Travels through Turkey in Asia (3rd edition, 1767): N.B. MR. CHARLES THOMPSON'S TRAVELS at large, in Three Volumes Octavo , illustrated with Variety of Maps and Plans properly colour'd, and with a great Number of Copper-Plate Cuts neatly engraved, may be had at Mr. NEWBERY'S in St. Paul's Churchyard . Price bound 15s. 8 In such a notice as this one there was hardly any difference from the type of advertisement I have already described. There was, however, some distinction: the notice was more tightly involved in the text of the book at hand than an advertisement on the last pages. Newbery's motive is clear; he was advertising one of Thompson's books in another. The Travels at Large had not been as successful as Travels through Turkey (there had been only one edition of the former in 1744, and Newbery was still advertising that stock in 1767); the advertisement here was clearly intended to exploit the popularity of the smaller (two volumes) and much less expensive (6s) work. More subtle appeals are evident in some of Newbery's belletristic efforts. In The Babler (1767), for example, Hugh Kelly referred to The Vicar of Wakefield at one point and to The Jealous Wife 9 at another. Although reviews and even mentions of current literary efforts were a very small part of this essay serial, it is interesting that of the few mentions two should have been to works in which Newbery had some interest. The same was true to a much greater extent in The Art of Poetry on a New Plan (1762); whenever possible, the writer of this work made use of Newbery's publications. Recent translations of The Henriade and Jerusalem Liberated received mention and praise, and Smart's poems were prominent as models for imitation. Newbery did not publish very much in the way of belles lettres , but it was natural, in a book of criticism and instruction in the art of writing poetry, that the works mentioned should be, as often as possible, his own. As I said, Smart seems to have been the center of most of the belletristic notices. Newbery's publications of the works of Francis Fawkes and the pseudonymous J. Copywell (William Woty) appeared after Smart had ceased writing for Newbery, but the bookseller still had some of Smart's works and reprinted several of them as late as the early sixties. Because Smart was, in the fifties and early sixties at least, the best-known poet Newbery had employed, references to the poet helped Fawkes and Copywell interest the bookseller in their collections and eventually guaranteed that Smart's works would be remembered for a somewhat longer time. In 1760 Newbery published Copywell's Shrubs of Parnassus . At one point in "The Caxon" the poet referred to an "idea-pot," which was glossed in a footnote: "A philosophical name for the head, communicated by the ingenious and ever-to-be remembered Mrs. Midnight." 10 The reference was to Smart's anonymous writing in The Midwife , one of the most popular of his efforts for Newbery. Two pages later was "On Hearing that the Tragedy of 'Merope' was to be acted for the Benefit of Mr. SMART." Here the poet lamented Smart's untimely mental disturbance and paid particular attention to Smart's religious poetry. At this time Smart had written, in a religious vein, only the Seaton-prize poems, which Newbery continued to sell until the end of his career. Just as Newbery's interest in The Shrubs of Parnassus was probably enhanced by these references to Smart's work, so too he was attracted to Fawkes's Original Poems and Translation (1761). Forty-four of the almost 300 pages of the collection were devoted to translations into English of three of Smart's Latin poems from Poems of Several Occasions , the volume which had been advertised in The Hilliad and Rolt's Memoirs of Lindesay . Fawkes's book had an extensive list of subscribers, including Mrs. Smart (Newbery's step-daughter), the Rev. Mr. William Dodd, David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith, Dr. Robert James (of Fever Powder fame), Samuel Johnson, Smollett, Sterne, Henry Thrale, William Whitehead, Newbery, and hundreds of others. At least part of the interest in this collection was a result of the honor done to Smart in it. Newbery could hardly fail to recognize the prestige which that honor would lend his establishment. His association with the world of fine literature was further strengthened by the Dodsleys' cooperation in the volume. The kind of cross-referring of publications I have been describing is even more apparent in the magazines in which he was involved. The Midwife (1750-53) and The Student (1750-51) contained reference to Newbery's other publications or to the bookseller himself. In The Midwife , for example, excerpts from Newbery's other publications were included and the reader told where he might purchase these works. In the first number is "A Ballad: Compos'd by Miss Nelly Pentweazle, a young Lady of Fifteen; and may with great Propriety be sung at Christenings." 11 The poem is a humorous lament for having lived fifteen years and still been a maid. Nelly Pentweazle was one of Smart's pseudonyms; neither he nor Newbery was willing to pass up an opportunity for puffing their other works, and there is a footnote to the poem: "The Above I borrow'd from the STUDENT, or OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE Monthly Miscellany; a six-penny Pamphlet consisting of Original Pieces only, and published with the Approbation and Assistance of those famous Universities." The same kind of cross-referring was used later with reference to another of Smart's anonymous efforts: As I have often given Specimens of Pieces of Poetry, in which I conceived there was Merit, I am sorry to have so long neglected the Horation Canons of Friendship, publish'd by my good Friend Mr. Newbery, in St. Paul's Churchyard.-----The Reader will find in the subsequent Extract, several good and facetious Rules for making and confirming Friendships, which I heartily recommend to the Perusal of those who chuse to call themselves my Friends. MARY MIDNIGHT ( Midwife , II, No. 4, [1752], 169-170). In both of these cases Smart was doubtless the writer of both the original works and of their advertisements. During the time that Smart was writing for The Midwife , he was also contributing to and probably editing The Student . Both works were conceived as appealing to relatively knowledgeable, sophisticated people, but The Midwife was directed primarily to readers in London. The coherence of that journal had to do with its maintaining a light, almost Scriblerian tone. Although the same light tone was characteristic of much of The Student , considerably more flexibility of subject and tone was possible here. The coherence of The Student had to do with the homogeneity of the intended audience; it was a monthly miscellany of the productions of students at the two universities. That it was largely written by the students guaranteed an audience, and the readers might be expected to be interested in a variety of subjects from humor to elaborate Biblical criticism. Smart assured that his own works would receive notice: there were references to his Horation Canons and to The Midwife . One of the contributions was a humorous autobiography by the Female Student, who concluded her letter by telling the reader, "I am that very same MIDNIGHT, who publishes the Old Woman's Magazine, which makes so much noise in the world." 12 Another of the letters was by a young clergyman, who lamented the present state of the world and told of his patron, a man who had ruined his estate "by that fashionable vice, which is so finely satiriz'd in a poem lately publish'd (and, I am told, by one of your society) call'd NEWMARKET, a Satire" ( Student , II, No. 5 [1751], 182). Thomas Warton the younger had written the poem, which Newbery published in 1751. Newbery himself was also brought to the notice of the readers of The Student : To the LADIES. A GENTLEMAN who would willingly dispose of himself in MARRIAGE, to any YOUNG LADY of BEAUTY, MERIT, and FORTUNE, may be seen and treated with on Thursday the 5th of APRIL at our PUBLISHER's in St. Paul's Church Yard. N.B. He will sit in the middle of the shop with his face toward the door , in order to be looked at; But LADIES who come for a view, are desired not to LAUGH; and those who have no inclination to marry , are desired not to look in ALL THE DAY ( Student , I, No. 3 [1750], 104). Clearly a mock advertisement of this kind was different from references to Newbery's publications, and here it seems almost as though Newbery had joined in a prank. In an essay "On the Learning of Oxford Tradesmen and College Servants," however, Newbery's role was more complex. The humor in this essay lay in the Student's mild contempt for the affectations of tradesmen and servants: A tooth-drawer amongst us denotes his occupation by an excellent poetical distich ; a second with great propriety stiles himself operator for the teeth ; and my printer who sells JAMES's fever powder , GREENOUGH's tinctures , HOOPER's female pills , and the like exhibits to our view in large golden letters over his door the pompous denomination of Medicinal Warehouse ( Student , I, No. 2 [1750], 53-54). Newbery may have been one of the jokers in the advertisement for a wife, but here he was quite obviously the butt of the joke, and it may seem strange that he should have allowed himself to be treated in such a way. The bookseller's appearances in these two references show him as a linear, if very temperate, descendant of the notoriously exhibitionistic Edmund Curll. Newbery did not, however, choose often to appear so frivolous, either as prankster or as butt. The Student also presented him in the fully developed role of the philanthropist. In the fourth number of the magazine (April 1750, I, 132-135) there was "A SCHEME to raise a FUND for the maintenance of the WIDOWS and CHILDREN of the inferior CLERGY." In succeeding numbers there were several pathetic histories of the misfortunes of the families of dead clergymen, and in July appeared a letter "To the CLERGY of GREAT-BRITAIN" in which the writer continued to seek support for the cause: As the SCHEME, which was published in our Fourth Number, for raising a FUND for the maintenance of the WIDOWS of such CLERGYMEN who should die and leave their families in distressed circumstances , cannot be perfected without the consent of the whole body, or at least a great majority, You are all earnestly desired to peruse and consider that design, and send your opinions thereon (post paid) to Mr. NEWBERY at the Bible and Sun in St. Paul's Church-Yard , who will communicate them to a Society of CLERGYMEN who assemble weekly for this purpose ( Student , I, No. 7 [1750], 264). Here, then, was the kind of image-building that was so important to Newbery. He became in this notice the expediter of a benevolent project to remedy a situation which had become a cause célèbre for a number of people. Goldsmith included Newbery in The Vicar of Wakefield as "the philanthropic Bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard," whose assistance to Primrose was only a fictional manifestation of the bookseller's philanthropy. Newbery was a genuinely benevolent man, but my intention here is not to document his benevolence. Rather, I am concerned to demonstrate the rhetorical importance of projecting an image of benevolence and to show the ways in which that image contributed to his success. In the Preface to An Introduction to Physic and Surgery (second edition, 1763) Richard Brookes, emphasizing the utility and cheapness of his work, made particular reference to Newbery: "I must do my Bookseller so much Justice as to declare, that he was not very anxious about his private Advantage, provided he could contribute to the Benefit of the Public." 13 Again the spirit of the reference is clear. Given the image of benevolence which Newbery promoted in these and other publications, I find his interest in patent medicines an eminently coherent feature of his mercantile career. Scattered through the pages of the London Chronicle and most of the metropolitan and provincial newspapers in which Newbery had an interest were scores of advertisements for his medicines and cosmetics, along with the notices for the books. Specific advertisements for specific medicines assumed that the man who sold them was a disinterested promoter of health and welfare. The disinterested philanthropist who appeared in so many of Newbery's advertisements would quite naturally appear to be a reliable source for medicines. The reputation for benevolence, however, was nowhere more important than in his involvement in children's literature. I must emphasize one point before I discuss some of the notices for specific books. Dr. Johnson said about books written for the education and improvement of children, "Remember always . . . that the parents buy the books, and that the children never read them." 14 Although Johnson overstated the case, he touched on the crucial problem of marketing books for children. Newbery's appeals for his juvenile publications had to be at least as much to adults as to the children themselves. For this reason I shall be initially concerned with the advertisements which were placed in publications for adults. In the appeals to adult buyers Newbery almost always emphasized the utilitarian values of the juvenile publications. He advertised Atlas Minimus (1758) as A proper CHRISTMAS-BOX or NEW-YEAR'S-GIFT for young Gentlemen and Ladies . . .: Where may be had, by those who would make the most of their Time and while they are at Play acquire a useful Branch of Knowledge, A Set of GEOGRAPHICAL CARDS: Containing Maps of all the Empires, Kingdoms, and States in the World; and yet so contrived as to be played with as other Cards are. Price 6s a Pack ( LC , 19-21 December 1758, p. 594). With the Atlas Minimus the cards would provide an introduction to geography, and the children might play themselves into knowledge. Even at the end of the collected edition of The Midwife there was an advertisement for The Lilliputian Magazine , "Being an Attempt to mend the World, to render the Society of Man more amiable, and to establish the Plainness, Simplicity, and Wisdom of the Golden Age, so much celebrated by the Poets and Historians ." 15 The notice here, as was often the case, was a quotation of part of the title page, but that notice and the title page itself were clearly designed to appeal more to adults than they were to attract children. I have already discussed some of the advertisements in Millenium Hall , but the most interesting puffing in that volume was not in the form of advertisements per se . At the very beginning of that work Newbery included a notice concerning a passage in the book. 16 Newbery feared that his readers might consider him vain for having included the author's praise of his efforts for children, but he said that the author "is of too much Consequence to be obstinately contradicted; and as the bookseller could not prevail on him to leave out the Compliment above-mentioned, he hopes his publishing of it will not be imputed to any other Motive, but that of his Readiness to obey." 17 The reader's interest would have been provoked by this disclaimer, which directed him to the following passage on the first page: Your constant endeavours have been to inculcate the best principles into youthful minds, the only probable means of mending Mankind; for the foundation of most of our virtues, or our vices, are laid in that season of life when we are most susceptible of impression. . . . The writer continued that he had to defer to Newbery's judgment as to whether his effort would conduce to "your great end of benefitting the world" (p. 2). In Tom Telescope's Newtonian System of Philosophy Adapted to the Capacities of Young Gentlemen and Ladies (3rd edition, 1766), p. 126, Newbery included an address to the parents, guardians, and governesses in Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Colonies, in which he emphasized the same importance of influencing children while they were still young, "to warm their Affections with such little Histories as are capable of giving them Delight, and of impressing on their tender Minds proper Sentiments of Religion, Justice, Honour and Virtue." He concluded his address: "How far Mr. NEWBERRY's [ sic ] little Books may tend to forward this good Work, may be, in some Measure, seen by what are already published, and, it is presumed, will more evidently appear by others which are coming from the Press" (p. 127). These are some examples of the embodiment of Newbery's image; he wanted to be seen as the improver of mankind. In that attempt he was highly successful. However, Newbery had to make his books as attractive to children as to their parents. His earliest attempt 18 was in A Little Pretty Pocket-Book (12th edition?, 1767) which was advertised as "intended for the INSTRUCTION and AMUSEMENT OF LITTLE MASTER TOMMY AND PRETTY MISS POLLY . With Two Letters from JACK the GIANT KILLER; AS ALSO A BALL AND PINCUSHION; The Use of which will infallibly make Tommy a good Boy, and Polly a good Girl." 19 Although the immediate reference of "which" in the last clause was to the ball and pincushion, it referred, I think, to the whole package. Newbery was clearly counting on appealing both to parents' desires for their children to be instructed and improved and to children's desires to be entertained with a pleasant book and toy. Newberry's business was to sell books: the adition of a ball or pincushion might attract a child to one book, but it would not sell other juvenile publications. I have discussed Newbery's use of book lists with reference to more or less adult works, a procedure that he followed in the juveniles. If anything, the book lists were more extensive in the juveniles; he usually included all the children's books he had in stock. One of the most frequently used formats for his books of juvenile instruction was the device of letters from an adult to a child, as in Charles Allen's Polite Lady (second edition, 1769), a series of letters from a mother, Portia, to her daughter, Sophy. At one point Portia says, "I have sent you Newbery's dictionary, to assist you in spelling . . ." (p. 9), and later she discusses the value of history in a child's education and tells her daughter, "I would have you, in the mean time, to read a very judicious and accurate abridgment of English history, written in the form of letters from a nobleman to his son, and printed in two volumes 12mo . . ." (p. 35). The work which she mentioned was Goldsmith's History , published, of course, by Newbery. The cross references in the books for little children are the most entertaining of all. The first rule in all of these works was that reading is a necessary part of being successful and even of being good. Miss Margery Meanwell, better known as Goody Two-Shoes, and Giles Gingerbread were both readers, and it was to their reading and subsequent education that they owed their ultimate success. The corollary of this rule was that the children might have their books of their good friend, Mr. Newbery. In books in which books played an important role, the books which were read were almost always Newbery's. At the end of an anecdote in Fables in Verse for the Improvement of the Young and the Old (1757), Woglog the great giant hit off a bon mot and "step'd into Mr. Leake's to read one of Mr. Newbery's little books." 20 The same technique was used in Goody Two-Shoes (3rd edition, 1766), when one of Margery's students "sung to Cuzz's Chorus (which may be found in the Little Pretty Play Thing , published by Mr. Newbery) and to the same tune to which it is there set." 21 Here there was no attempt to include descriptions of works or to emphasize those works' improving qualities; Newbery merely wanted to make sure that his young readers would be reminded that if they enjoyed the book they were reading, they might find further enjoyment in his other publications. Reading, these notices implied, was a primary source of enjoyment, and Newbery had the books to provide that enjoyment. Newbery was the first publisher to attempt seriously and on a wide scale to appeal to children, and to parents for their children. By examining his advertisements, one sees that Newbery's involvement in children's literature is coherent with his usual marketing practices. His usual emphasis in those advertisements which were not strictly descriptive was on aiding social aspirants. In the advertisements for adults Newbery frequently identified himself implicitly with these people and presented himself as a man who had succeeded and who wanted to help his customers to succeed. In the advertisements for children's books Newbery's appeal was one of a benevolent man who desired to encourage children to do what would be good and delightful for them.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Writing and Printing of Joseph Warton's Essay on Pope by David Fairer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In January 1755 the publisher Robert Dodsley received from his friend Joseph Warton a printed half-sheet as a specimen of a projected Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope . 1 It was the beginning of a commitment which was not finally fulfilled until 1782, but which brought Warton fame (sweetened by respectable notoriety) and the attention of twentieth-century bibliographers. The Essay has long been of interest because of the strange history of its publication. 2 The first volume, with its challenging dedication to the author of Night Thoughts ('What is there very sublime or very Pathetic in Pope?'), was published by Dodsley in April 1756, but because he was nervous at the book's challenging anonymity he preferred to work behind the scenes, and placed on the title-page the name of his agent Mary Cooper rather than his own. Although two revised editions of this volume were published (1762, 1772) its companion second volume remained unexposed until 1782, when it appeared before the world with the statement that the first two hundred pages had been in print for over twenty years. However, interest in these volumes is not confined to their publication; for although published from London, it can now be shown that the Essay was actually printed in Oxford, and under the close supervision of Joseph's brother Thomas Warton, the historian of English poetry. Unpublished correspondence between the brothers reveals something of the evolution of the two volumes, of the active role of Thomas, and of Joseph's attitude to a book which he clearly intended should cause something of a stir in the literary world. Here is a description of the two volumes in their first editions: [Title-page in black and red ] AN | ESSAY | ON THE | WRITINGS | AND | GENIUS | OF | POPE. | [rule 92 mm.] | [motto from Quintilian] | [rule 92 mm.] | LONDON : | Printed for M.

II is clearly expressed in the bibliographical details. The cancels all occur within the first two hundred pages and the press-figures begin at this point: 2C4 is the last cancel and bears the first page (2C4 b = p. 200) with a figure. An analysis of the headlines in vol. II is similarly indicative. Throughout pages 1-199 three distinctive skeletons recur, the salient features of each being: 1. A break in the bottom curve of the 'O' in 'OF' 2. A break in the left bar of the 'N' in 'GENIUS' 3. A nick in the right bar of the 'N' in 'GENIUS' They occur on the rectos of the following leaves: 1. D2 F4 H3 N4 P4 Q3 R3 T4 X3 Z1 2C2 2. D3 F3 H4 K3 N3 P3 Q4 R4 T2 X2 Z2 3. D1 H2 K2 N2 P2 Q1 R1 T1 Z4 2C1 None of these occurs after 2C2 a (p. 195). From sheet 2D onwards (pp. 201 to end) the recto headlines vary in length between 55 and 57 mm. (usually 56 mm.); but throughout the earlier part of the book the length is 54-55 mm. (usually 54 mm.), the only exceptions being the eight cancelled leaves, the recto headlines of which are 58 mm. (B2 a ) and 57 mm. (the remaining seven). Besides illustrating the clear division after page 200, this latter piece of evidence suggests that the cancelling in the early part of the volume was done in 1781-82, while the later part was being printed. (The eight cancels do not bear any of the three skeletons recurrent in the early part). 3 There is therefore convincing bibliographical support for Joseph Warton's statement that pages 1-200 had been in print for over twenty years. However, such complications were far from his mind when, in January 1755, he sent the first specimen half-sheet from the Oxford press to Robert Dodsley in London. Dodsley's reaction to Joseph Warton's specimen was generally favourable, but tinged with uneasiness that his friend would write 'in too peremptory a manner'. On 20 Jan. 1755 he remarked to Thomas Warton: I hope for his own sake that he will allow Pope his just Praise. I like the specimen of Paper &amp; Print, &amp; suppose you will get it done as cheap at Oxford as I should here, and as quick, for the Parliament will rise the very beginning of April. If it be well written, and the Criticisms new and important, I should imagine you might print 750; if otherwise, 500 may be more than enough. 4 During the final stages of the printing of his Vergil in the autumn of 1752 Joseph had been in London to overlook the edition at close quarters, becoming intimate with Johnson, enjoying Dodsley's hospitality and attending plays. 5 This was obviously a luxury he felt unable to allow himself in 1755, and so the decision to print the Essay in Oxford was an excellent idea: there his brother Thomas Warton, fellow of Trinity and soon to be Poetry Professor, could overlook the presses and handle the proofs, making any last minute corrections or adjustments, a kindred spirit and collaborator who could be trusted to deal with any problems which might arise during the printing. But a more important reason is that while Dodsley was handling the specimen Joseph, though he had all the materials, had not yet written the Essay . The extant correspondence with his brother during the year 1755 gives a picture of Joseph working hard to keep the flow of copy going. Though from the beginning of the year he had the matter and the plan, it is an important consideration for the digressive, annotatory character of the work that it was reaching its final form while the presses were working. The printing was under way by 28 February, when in a postscript to an incomplete letter Joseph complained: ' ed in the participles remain ed is not preserved by the printers'. 6 The next surviving letter is from Thomas on 19 April, when his brief reference to the state of the printing gives an interesting glimpse of the 'hand to mouth' progress of the work: 'As soon as possible send us just copy enough for the remains of this half sheet, that what is now composed may be worked off.' 7 The Essay on Pope would seem to be an excellent example of how piecemeal supply of copy necessitated half-sheet imposition on a 'work and turn' basis. 8 By this method only eight pages of text needed to stand in type at any one time, the sheet being worked on one side, turned, then worked on the reverse to produce when halved two completed half-sheets. Evidently the delays in arrival of copy could mean that a half-sheet was left partially composed, waiting for a few further pages of manuscript to arrive. Some idea of the proof-reading methods is given in Joseph's letter of 28 April: Send me the peice of copy that is left that I may correct it right. You have Queried about VoltEire —page 123 at bottom—verse, &amp; whom either the tragedy &amp;c —— instead of where—you did not want this proof did you? 9 It is tempting to believe that Joseph was asking for the return of copy to check the proofs, but his words, though confused, will not bear this interpretation. Apparently Thomas had sent for Joseph's inspection a proof bearing a couple of marginal queries (there would seem to be no doubt that one printing was correct and the other an error). Joseph himself was not reading proof; he therefore assumed that his brother had made the necessary alteration and did not want the half-sheet to be returned. The 'peice of copy' was probably the remainder of his previous delivery of copy, still uncomposed, which Joseph wished to check over and return with his next instalment. During May Joseph was much occupied by a troublesome change of house: the family had to move two miles from Winslade, Hants., to the Rectory at Tunworth, to which Joseph was instituted on 17 July (apparently there were workmen to be 'looked to'). These preoccupations seem to have interfered with Joseph's work, as his brother wrote on 9 May: I will advertise the Printer of your Deferring Copy—You are in the right, if [you] have not time; we will make the best Use of the long Vacation to complete our respective Tasks. 10 And on the 16th Joseph confessed: 'I now speak in time, and greatly fear that I shall not have much copy by the 15th of June'; 11 however on 20 May he was assuring Thomas he was 'not idle with respect to Pope'. 12 By October matters had progressed and Joseph was faced with a decision as to what form the publication should take. The first intention seems to have been a single volume, but writing to Thomas on 18 Oct. he put forward another suggestion: Depend on it the press shall not stop for me—but I beg you to write directly— What You sent me was very well executed—all things considerd perhaps it will be better to bring out a 4s. Volume directly for I am sure of Matter enough for a Second of that Size. . . . P.S. You will receive a Large Packet by Mr. Trist Jervoise on Thursday night. . . . If you have any Copy 13 send it in the inclosed frank for it will amuse me. 14 As the beginning of the letter is missing, it is not possible to establish Joseph's considerations, but it is likely that they were financial ones. Clearly, this is the moment at which he decided on the separate publication of a first volume, the elasticity of his intentions being shown by the statement that he was 'sure of Matter enough for a Second'. The plan of the whole work had not even at this stage distinctly formed in his mind, although his materials (quite possibly in the shape of a heavily-annotated edition of Pope) 15 were to hand. By early November Joseph had received a letter from his friend Edward Young accepting the dedication of the volume, 16 and soon afterwards he wrote to Thomas with more copy: 'This is all I can send, but surely will be full enough—print it all—I think you'l like it very well—'. 17 Joseph was now becoming concerned about the delay and was eager to calculate how much more copy was needed to make up a volume: 'It must be printed off before Xmas—if you have not time, leave the Index . . . — You had seven sheets only to make 312 pages to print off when you wrote —'. 18 Although Joseph Warton has been accused of a certain pusillanimity in his unwillingness to publish his second volume, his attitude to the first shows that he was fully aware of the challenging nature of the Essay and wished if possible to capitalize on it. In the same letter he asked his brother the significant question: 'Shall I produce my Scale of poets in the Dedication to make Stare or not—'. Thomas apparently agreed, for the dedication as it finally stood was certainly provocative enough to 'make stare', with its inclusion of Otway and Lee ('at proper intervals') among the 'sublime and pathetic' writers in the first class, above the station of Dryden and (as readers would have predicted) Pope himself. 19 Joseph Warton relied considerably upon his brother's judgment and initiative, and he expected that Thomas would sometimes take matters into his own hands: Mind the note of Atyss , &amp; the note of a Story . . . . If you think the Story of Thedbald too light &amp; ludicrous, omit it. . . . Weigh the Story which is a good one—I like your making the rape of the Lock a Single Section. Pray do so whenever tis necessary. 20 To accord The Rape of the Lock a section of its own 21 is an excellent though obvious idea: Joseph, it seems, had rather lost sight of such questions as the shape of the Essay and was sending Thomas a series of notes on passages of Pope as he wrote them. Rather like his brother's Observations on the Faerie Queene published the previous year, Joseph's Essay was tending to become 'materials for an edition' of Pope. Reviewing the second volume, Edmund Cartwright complained of the author's 'rambling, desultory manner'; 22 his method of writing for the press can only have encouraged this. By the beginning of March 1756 enough of the Essay had been printed to form a first volume. On 11 March Dodsley wrote to Thomas Warton: I am glad the book is at last finisht and I think no time should be lost in sending it up. The best way will be to let Mr Fletcher keep full as many as he thinks he can use; and send the rest of the Impression up to Mrs Cooper. In her Bale you may tye up a hundred for me . . . As the Work is printed on so good a Paper I should think it might make a 5s book bound. But that may be determin'd when I see it, or do you consult Mr Fletcher. 23 And so in April 1756 the book appeared, at 5s. bound, to a generally favourable reception and a polite review by Dr Johnson. 24 Dodsley's willingness to leave the price decision to Fletcher suggests that the latter had some deeper responsibility for the volume than that of being its Oxford bookseller; but there is no direct evidence to prove that he was a partner with Dodsley over this. It is interesting, however, to discover that in 1759 it was to James Fletcher that Joseph proposed a scheme for a volume of Voltaire, once again to be printed at Oxford with brother Thomas overlooking the presses. This venture was not carried through, but Joseph presented his plan to Fletcher as follows: It is to print a Work entitled—Les Chef D'Oevres [ sic ] de Voltaire. That is six of his most select Tragedies with two of his Dissertations on Tragedy. . . . This book is designed to be a Partner to your Corneille; &amp; Voltaire is so popular a writer &amp; these six peices, lost among other trash of his Works, are so eminently good, that I think this select collection would certainly sell. My Brother will correct the press, &amp; I will select the peices, &amp; He, &amp; myself, &amp; You will undergo joint profit &amp; Loss. I would have it printed on the same Type &amp; Paper with your Corneille &amp; at the Clarendon Press. 25 Obviously Joseph considered that the printing arrangements for the Essay on Pope had been successful and was willing to repeat the procedure. The role of Mary Cooper is less ill-defined. Ralph Straus sums up Dodsley's relationship with her at this time: the publishers with whom he seems to have been on terms of the closest business intimacy were the Coopers, from whose busy house at the Globe in Paternoster Row went forth some thousands of books of all kinds. Nearly every month saw the production of a new book 'Printed for R.Dodsley, and sold by T. [or M.] Cooper.' The exact nature of their agreement does not appear. It would seem indeed, that the Coopers had acted as agents in many cases, merely distributing Dodsley's publications throughout the trade. 26 Being essentially a retail bookseller Dodsley was unable to supply the 'trade' from his Pall Mall shop, and so Mary Cooper, who had a flourishing trade with the country booksellers, was obviously a valuable agent. 27 Informing Joseph Warton of the publication Dodsley added: I gave Mrs. Cooper directions about advertising, and have sent to her this afternoon, to desire she will look after its being inserted in the evening papers. . . . But you have surely not kept your secret . . . many whom I cannot now think on have ask'd for it as yours or your brother's. I have sold many of them in my own shop, and have dispers'd and push'd it as much as I can; and have said more than I could have said if my name had been to it. 28 But there was a more prudential reason for his anonymity: had Dodsley put his name to the volume he would have been exposed to demands for the author's identity from the gentry and literati who were his clients, and he would have risked offending them by a refusal to reveal the name. Dodsley's agent Mary Cooper would in any case have taken a large stock of the book, and placing her name on the title-page can have had no adverse effect on the book's circulation. In an Advertisement to the second volume of the Essay (1782), Joseph Warton stated that 'this volume was printed, as far as the 201st page, above twenty years ago'. It would appear that in 1756 he did not immediately forge ahead with the continuation but delayed until 1759. On 19 April of that year Robert Lowth wrote to him: I was very glad to see that you were fairly engaged in the 2d volume; and hope you will go on with it with alacrity and expedition. The objection to your being further employed in such a work, in your present situation, of which you seemed apprehensive, I dare say will never rise up against you: on the contrary I will venture to answer for it, that it will turn out not only to your own personal credit, but very much for the reputation of the place from whence it comes. 29 It would seem that since the publication of the first volume Joseph had been having doubts as to the propriety of a respected schoolmaster's engaging in literary controversy ('the place from whence it comes' can only mean Winchester School, of which Joseph had become second master in 1755). This reassurance from Lowth, then Archdeacon of Winchester, must have encouraged him to continue, for printing was again under way early the following year. On 8 Feb. 1760 Joseph wrote to Thomas: I received the 2 proofs, which I was glad to receive, as I wanted to see how much more Copy would do. It is 2 books &amp; a half more at furthest. I have gone on. Pray look at the Greek—there are some faults in that from Antoninus. But the whole is well—from Hume 's words is a blunder, distrust instead of disturb . 30 What think you of a small project viz. to put at the end about 6 Leaves called Additional Notes —in which I have some curious things too late now to bring in. 31 Evidently the printing arrangements were those for the first volume. Joseph received the proofs not for proof-reading, but merely to keep him in touch with the work's progress: he does not mention them, and the Hume 'blunder' remained in the printed version (which suggests the half-sheet had been printed off when Thomas received Joseph's letter). Although the second volume of the Essay was now making progress and Joseph Warton was in sight of the end, all work stopped after the printing of p. 200 (this must have happened later in 1760); and when a second edition of the Essay appeared in 1762, it was unaccompanied by the concluding volume. Joseph did not withhold the final part from the press, because none existed. He simply stopped writing it. His pen was not taken up to complete the work until 1781, when he was almost certainly fired into action by Johnson's 'Life of Pope'. 32 It is impossible to be certain of the 'motives of a most delicate and laudable nature' 33 which caused him to cease writing, but the answer could be the simple one already suggested. The date of his proposal to Fletcher (twelve days before Lowth's letter) is perhaps significant: Joseph may at that moment have been considering abandoning the Essay in favour of the Voltaire scheme as one more befitting his position. It must be admitted, however, that the first volume had not aroused any general controversy (it was rather a case of traditional scholarship leading to an original conclusion) and it may be that Joseph's scruples were caused by a particularly influential individual who had been displeased with his adjustment of Pope's reputation. There is no solid evidence to identify this person, but the fact that Joseph probably ceased writing in the Spring or Summer of 1760 gives some support to Dr Pittock's suggestion that he was unwilling to offend his patron Lord Lyttelton, whose Dialogues of the Dead appeared in April-May 1760. 34</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Compositional History of the Biographia Literaria by Daniel Mark Fogel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Introduction We now know that Coleridge wrote most of the Biographia Literaria during the summer of 1815. We are faced, however, with two major, conflicting reconstructions of Coleridge's work from June through September of 1815. The first, developed by J. Shawcross in 1907 and based on the pioneering researches of J. Dykes Campbell, was modified but not fundamentally altered by George Watson in the introduction to his 1956 edition of the Biographia . The Shawcross-Watson reconstruction is that Coleridge had written, by July of 1815, a literary autobiography comprising most of the first half of the Biographia Literaria . Then, Shawcross and Watson conjecture, Coleridge sat down to write a preface to the autobiography. The preface, consisting of the critique of Wordsworth (the chief matter of the second half of the Biographia ), grew so long that it had to be appended to the already existing work. 1 The most recent account of the birth of the Biographia was set forth in 1959 by E. L. Griggs in his introduction and notes to Volumes III and IV of the Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge . Griggs not only clashes with Shawcross and Watson in his description of the project which yielded the Biographia but also reverses the order they have assigned to the composition of the book's major elements. "At no time," says Griggs, "did Coleridge plan a preface to his autobiography." 2 Rather, the Biographia was an extension, in the summer of 1815, of the preface to a projected volume of poems, Sibylline Leaves . By July, Griggs argues, Coleridge had written the critique of Wordsworth. Then, in August and September, he added the "philosophical Part" (the chief matter of the first half of the Biographia ). 3 Griggs's version of the genesis of the Biographia , though based, as we shall see, on better evidence than had been available to Shawcross and Watson, has not put an end to the dispute. Watson allows only that Griggs "has restored to obscurity Coleridge's account of the composition of the Biographia " ( BL -Watson, p. xxi). The controversy is a signal instance of how evidence, though abundant, may not suffice for certainty. Nevertheless, the evidentiary materials, including correspondence about the Biographia by Morgan, Hood, Gutch, and Gale &amp; Fenner at Victoria College, Toronto, Griggs's 1959 volumes of Coleridge's Collected Letters , and Kathleen Coburn's recently published volume of his Notebooks , now make it possible to establish to a high degree of probability the important events in the making of Coleridge's great critical work. The tabular synopsis, below, of the probable evolution of the Biographia , and the "Analytic Narrative" following, aim to identify explicitly the chapters belonging to each stage of the composition of that book. This newly detailed and revised history of the text has important implications for the interpretation of the Biographia and for the solution of some problems raised by the volume— for example, the reasons for the seeming discrepancy in Coleridge's treatment of the imagination in Chapters XIII and XIV, and the practical necessities, given the deadlines, for his wholesale importations from Schelling and others. So far as previous scholarship on the question is concerned, the present essay confirms, for the most part, the validity of Griggs's compact arguments about the evolution of the Biographia from a preface to a book of poems, analogous to Wordsworth's Preface to the Lyrical Ballads of 1800, to an independent "Work per se" ( CL , IV, 585).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. A Tabular Synopsis: Probable Evolution of the Biographia Literaria Note: Abbreviations in parentheses refer to documentary evidence identified in the list following the table. Month Year Probable Events in the Making of the Biographia October 1800 Coleridge (STC) expresses interest in writing "An Essay on the Elements of Poetry." (A) July 1802 STC feels a growing need to define a suspected "radical difference" between himself and Wordsworth. (B,C) September 1803 STC conceives of writing "my metaphysical works as my life &amp; in my life." (D) October &amp; November 1811 STC writes lecture notes on which he will draw in detail, in 1815, for Chapter XIV of the Biographia . (E) March 1815 In desperate financial straits, STC plans a collection of his poems. It will include "a general Preface . . . on the Principles of philosophic and genial criticism relatively to the Fine Arts; but especially to Poetry," and should be "ready for the press by June." (F,G,H) April &amp; May 1815 STC collects his poems. He receives a copy of the 1815 edition of Wordsworth's poems ( CL , III, xlviii). At the end of May he tells Wordsworth that he has "only to finish a preface which I shall have done in two or at farthest three days." (I,J) June &amp; July 1815 STC extends the preface to his poems, making it "an Autobiographia literaria, or Sketches of my literary Life &amp; opinions, as far as Poetry and poetical Criticism is concerned." So extended, the preface consists, by 29 July, of Chapters I through V and XIV through XXII of the Biographia . (K,L,O) August &amp; September 1815 Deluding himself that he will finish rapidly, STC expands ten to twelve manuscript pages of metaphysics throughout most of these two months. On 10 August, Morgan sends Chapters I-III to Bristol, where the work will be printed. STC revises Chapters IV and V and writes Chapters VI through XIII. Perhaps between 10 August and 20 August, certainly by 17 September, STC's conception of his work changes. It is no longer subordinate to the book of poems to which it was to be the preface. It is now the more important work and a book in its own right. He decides to divide it into chapters. STC writes into the third week in September. On 19 September ( CL , III, xlix) he sends "compleat to my printer" the manuscript of the Biographia . (L,M,N,O,Q, R,S,T,U) October 1815 Printing of the Biographia begins ( CL , III, xlix). April &amp; May 1816 Gutch tells Morgan he has discovered that the two volumes, one the Biographia Literaria , the other Sibylline Leaves , will be of unequal size. Morgan consults with John Murray and STC, then advises Gutch to split the Biographia into two volumes, making the three volumes proportionate. (V) Month Year Probable Events in the Making of the Biographia July 1816 STC contracts with Gale &amp; Fenner to publish the Biographia , Sibylline Leaves , and all his future works. Gutch informs STC that there is not enough manuscript to make Volume II of the Biographia equal in size to Volume I and Sibylline Leaves . (W,X) August through December 1816 Relations between Gutch and STC disintegrate. In the fall, Gutch stops the printing of the Biographia at the end of page 144 of Volume II. STC plans to assemble additional materials required by "the printer's blunder." (Y,Z,AA,BB) January through June 1817 Gale &amp; Fenner negotiate with Gutch to obtain the manuscript and the printed sheets of the Biographia . The materials do not arrive in London until April, and the publishers do not finally settle with Gutch until May. (CC, DD, FF, GG, II, JJ, KK, LL) Early in the year, STC considers supplying Zapolya to fill out Volume II of the Biographia . Since the rights to publication of Zapolya have been promised to John Murray, however, STC decides to insert "Satyrane's Letters" and the critique of Bertram instead. STC writes the "Conclusion" of the Biographia and possibly pads the last two-thirds of Chapter XXII. (EE, HH, II, MM, NN) Samuel Curtis completes the printing of the Biographia . July 1817 The Biographia Literaria and Sibylline Leaves are published. 4 (OO) List of Documentary Evidence for Reconstruction of the Composition of the Biographia Literaria A) STC, letter to Humphry Davy, 9 October 1800; B) STC, letter to William Sotheby, 13 July 1802; C) STC, letter to Robert Southey, 29 July 1802; D) STC, notebook entry of September, 1803, #1515; E) STC, notebook entries of 1811-1812, #4111 and #4112; F) STC, letter to Joseph Cottle, 7 March 1815; G) STC, letter to Cottle, 10 March 1815; H) STC, letter to Byron, 30 March 1815; I) STC, letter to Lady Beaumont, 3 April 1815; J) STC, letter to William Wordsworth, 30 May 1815; K) STC, letter to Dr. Brabant, 29 July 1815; L) John Morgan, letter to Thomas Hood, 10 August 1815; M) Morgan, letter to Hood, 14 August 1815; N) Morgan, letter to Hood, 17 August 1815; O) Mary Lamb, letter to Sarah Hutchinson, 20 August 1815; P) STC, notebook entry of August-September 1815, #4265; Q) STC, letter to John Gutch, 17 September 1815; R) STC, letter to John May, 27 September 1815; S) STC, letter to Daniel Stuart, 7 October 1815; T) STC, letter to Byron, 15 October 1815; U) STC, letter to Washington Allston, 25 October 1815; V) Morgan, letter to Gutch, 6 May 1816; W) STC, letter to John Gale, 8 July 1816; X) STC, letter to Morgan, 17 July 1816; Y) STC, letter to Gutch, 6 August 1816; Z) STC, letter to Rest Fenner, 22 September 1816; AA) Hood, letter to STC, 23 October 1816; BB) Gutch, letter with accounts to STC, 18 December 1816; CC) Gale &amp; Fenner, letter to Gutch, 14 January 1817; DD) Gutch, letter to Gale &amp; Fenner, January, 1817; EE) STC, letter to John Murray, 27 February 1817; FF) Gale &amp; Fenner, letter to Gutch, 5 March 1817; GG) Gutch, letter to Gale &amp; Fenner, March, 1817; HH) STC, letter to Thomas Curtis, 14 March 1817; II) STC, letter to Curtis, 29 April 1817; JJ) Gale &amp; Fenner, letter to Gutch, 13 May 1817; KK) Gutch, letter to Gale &amp; Fenner, 14 May 1817; LL) Gale &amp; Fenner, letter to Gutch with accounts, 16 May 1817; MM) STC, letter to Curtis, May 1817; NN) STC, letter to Curtis, 22 May 1817; OO) STC, letter to Thomas Poole, 22 July 1817.

      <field name="fulltext">III. An Analytic Narrative of the Making of the Biographia Literaria The account of the Biographia 's pre-composition, supplied in its essentials by Shawcross, was given its most elegant and thought-provoking examination by George Whalley in 1953 and is summarized most clearly by George Watson in the introduction to his edition of the text ( BL -Watson, pp. ix-xii). 5 The first piece of evidence is a letter of 9 October 1800 to Humphry Davy (A) in which Coleridge says that he is even more interested in writing " An Essay on the Elements of Poetry " than in a long-contemplated work on Lessing. In 1802, Coleridge wrote two letters (B and C) which contain, according to M. H. Abrams, "the most revealing clues to Coleridge's standpoint and intention in his debate with Wordsworth." 6 Writing to Sotheby and Southey in July of 1802, Coleridge stresses in his plans for a work "Concerning Poetry" the discovery of "a radical difference" between himself and Wordsworth. This early plan, intended to make clear Coleridge's growing discomfort with Wordsworth's Preface to the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads (an essay Coleridge calls "half a child of my own Brain"), leads Watson to suggest that the conception of the Preface in the Vale of Grasmere in 1800 is "the first recorded moment in the life" of the Biographia ( BL -Watson, p. ix). In addition, Whalley cites a notebook entry of 1803 (D): "Seem to have made up my mind to write my metaphysical works as my life &amp; in my life—intermixed with all the other events or history of the mind &amp; fortunes of S. T. Coleridge." 7 Thus, in the opening years of the century, Coleridge possessed the main elements of the Biographia , both in its intense concern with speculation arising from his experience of Wordsworth and in its autobiographical intention. Yet between August of 1803 (the date of the notebook entry) and March of 1815, when the story of the Biographia resumes, there is no evidence that Coleridge so much as contemplated a literary autobiography. 8 These were the poet's blackest years, blighted by opium addiction and its attendant woes: financial insecurity, physical deterioration, the paralyzing torment of guilt about his apparent self-destruction, and the erosion of his personal relations. His friendship with Wordsworth was severely tried, and their rupture of 1810 was still fresh in Coleridge's mind when he settled with the family of John Morgan in early 1815. His desire to protect himself from Wordsworth by self-distinction, by drawing a clear line between himself and a man whom he considered the greater poet, must have been sharpened by his reflections on The Excursion , which had been out for just half a year. We should picture Coleridge as he has passed the threshold of middle age, at the end of a decade in which he had consulted no fewer than seven doctors in his struggle to understand and master opium addiction, viewing the productivity of his old comrade against the backdrop of his own inanition, and tormented not least of all because The Excursion had disappointed his high expectations. If we also consider Coleridge's extreme financial anxieties, on his family's as well as on his own behalf, we will gain a further, important insight into his probable state of mind in the early spring of 1815. Suddenly, in March of 1815, three letters indicate that Coleridge has determined to undertake a large project. A letter to Joseph Cottle early in the month (F) is the first signal of the long, remarkable burst of production comprising, among other works, the Biographia , Sibylline Leaves , the revised three-volume Friend , and The Statesman's Manual . The work in hand, which Coleridge offers Cottle as security for an advance of funds, is a volume of "my scattered &amp; my Manuscript Poems." Certain of refusal, he informs Cottle three days later (G) that he has asked Thomas Hood to solicit an advance from a group of friends in Bristol, Mss Poems equal to one volume of 250 to 300 pages being sent to them immediately." Hood complied, and the labor which would culminate in both Sibylline Leaves and the Biographia began. 9 Evidently Coleridge thought the volume of poems could be completed rapidly. At the end of March, he writes Lord Byron (H) and petitions for his good offices in finding a publisher for the collection, now envisaged as two volumes. 10 "A general Preface," he tells Byron, "will be pre-fixed, on the Principles of philosophic and genial criticism relatively to the Fine Arts in general; but especially to Poetry." Both volumes would "be ready for the press by the first week in June." 11 The next two months, April and May, were spent in gathering Coleridge's poems, editing them, and trying (unsuccessfully, despite his attempts to talk a good game) to add new verse to the collection. He is thus engaged when he writes to Lady Beaumont early in April (I), requesting that she send him her manuscript copy of his poem "To William Wordsworth." He explains that he is collecting poems to "be put to press by the middle of June." In May, after receiving a copy of Wordsworth's 1815 edition of his poems, Coleridge had to deal with Wordsworth's written request for an explanation of criticism of The Excursion passed on to him by Lady Beaumont from Coleridge's April letter to her (see CL , IV, 570-571). On 30 May, when Coleridge replies to Wordsworth (J), he is back on the schedule he had announced to Byron, for he has, he tells Wordsworth, "only to finish a Preface which I shall have done in two or at farthest three days." The poems, he must have thought then, were finally ready, and the "general Preface," which he had left till last, was such that it would be short work indeed. At this point we encounter the most tangled problem in the history of the text. For all of June and July—the first two of the four critical months in the composition of the Biographia —we have but one piece of evidence, Coleridge's letter of 29 July to R. H. Brabant (K). To be sure, this letter contains the key to the major questions concerning the birth of the Biographia . But it is a key which opens too many doors, only one of which can be correct. The letter announces the completion of a work which has fully occupied Coleridge for some time, probably steadily throughout June and July. It is undoubtedly the work which became the Biographia , for Coleridge calls it "an Autobiographia literaria" and describes his having given "a full account . . . of Wordsworth's Poems &amp; Theory" and "a disquisition on the powers of association, with the History of the Opinions on this subject from Aristotle to Hartley, and on the generic difference between the faculties of Fancy and Imagination." So much is beyond dispute. What is in contention is the evolution of the work as described in the first sentence of the letter. The letter to Brabant has been in the public domain since 1870, when an inaccurate transcript of the manuscript was printed in the Westminster Review . Because this was the only available text of the letter until 1959, Shawcross in 1907 and Watson in 1956 arrived at nearly identical conclusions about what it says. Shawcross with extreme caution and Watson with the assurance that the evidence is "perfectly explicit" surmise that Coleridge had by July of 1815 completed an autobiography ( BL -Watson, p. xiii). For, conjectures Shawcross, "the original preface was either conceived as a literary autobiography, or very soon took that form" ( BL -Shawcross, I, xc). By this account, Coleridge set out in July to write a preface to his literary life. This got out of hand, for he found himself writing the long critique of Wordsworth as well as at least part of the discussions of association and of fancy and imagination. Since what Coleridge had planned as a preface to "an Autobiographia literaria" had exceeded its limits, it "had to be incorporated," as Shawcross puts it, "into the whole work" ( BL -Shawcross, I, xc-xci). Shawcross believes that the work sent to Gutch in 1815 did not include Chapter XXII, for he follows Dykes Campbell's error in concluding that the Bristol printing ended with page 128, Volume II. Chapter XXII, says Shawcross, was not written until the necessity of padding the Biographia 's second volume arose in 1816. Watson holds that XXII was sent to Gutch in 1815. Since, however, the Bristol printing stopped at the end of page 144 of Volume II, about onethird of the way into Chapter XXII, and since printing did not resume at page 145 until the spring of 1817, Watson suggests that the final two-thirds of Chapter XXII may have been padded later (see BL -Watson, pp. xvixvii). 12 Otherwise, both Shawcross and Watson posit that the critique of Wordsworth, constituting Volume II of the Biographia (excepting only the interpolated matter of 1817 and the Conclusion) and a small portion of Volume I ("some part at least" of the philosophical material, says Shawcross) were the additions of midsummer 1815 to an already complete work comprising the greater part of Volume I. Basically they would have it that the book was built from bottom to top, Volume I preceding Volume II in composition. Yet there are strong grounds for believing the opposite to have been the case. Here is the first sentence of the letter to Brabant as read by Shawcross and by Watson when he wrote his preface in 1956: "The necessity of extending what I first intended as a preface to an Autobiographia Literaria, or Sketches of my literary life and opinions, as far as poetry and poetical criticism are concerned, has confined me to my study from eleven to four and from six to ten, since I last left you." 13 Here is the same sentence, printed in accurate transcript for the first time by Griggs in 1959: "The necessity of extending, what I first intended as a preface, to an Autobiographia literaria, or Sketches of my literary Life &amp; opinions, as far as poetry and poetical Criticism is [are] concerned, has confined me to my Study from 11 to 4, and from 6 to 10, since I last left you" ( CL , IV, 578). All of the differences from the earlier printed text of the letter are important, but the most telling difference is the insertion of commas setting off the words "what I first intended as a preface." Where Shawcross and Watson had read a compound noun, seeing Coleridge as having enlarged a prefaceto-an-Autobiographia, Griggs's text suggests, as he says, that "at no time did Coleridge propose a preface to his autobiography. In his letter of 29 July he refers to a preface to his poems" ( CL , IV, 578n.). For the comma severing "preface" from what Griggs reads as the indirect object of "extending" (so that he understands Coleridge to have extended the preface to the poems into "an Autobiographia literaria") makes the preface-to-an-Autobiographia reading less appealing. One notes too that Griggs's transcript offers nothing with any typographical resemblance to a book title. Coleridge's capitalization is old-fashioned (e.g. "Criticism" and "Study" in the first sentence of the letter to Brabant) and he does not always italicize the titles of books, yet it is rare to find titles in which he has both omitted italics and left the initial letters of key words in lower case. "Autobiographia literaria" is probably not a title to the work but merely a description of its nature: it is probably, though extended, a preface to the poems and not what Coleridge later called "a Work per se," which would have merited, if not italics, at least a capital "L" in "literaria." One might note that even before the Griggs transcription appeared, George Whalley took issue with Watson. Professor Whalley had always read the disputed sentence just as Griggs reads it. 14 Yet, in justice to Watson's reconstruction, it must be admitted that the letter by itself cannot "be interpreted with certainty" ( BL -Watson, p. xxi). That is, Watson may still be right. 15 But tracking the story of the Biographia one step further, we find evidence which swings the balance of probability to Griggs's view. Throughout August, Coleridge worked strenuously. He had two projects on his hands, the final preparation of material for Sibylline Leaves and of that for its extended preface, "an Autobiographia literaria." He was sufficiently preoccupied to leave all of his correspondence to John Morgan. Three letters of August, 1815, from Morgan to Thomas Hood provide evidence for reconstruction of the events of this period. 16 The most important of the three, dated 10 August 1815 (L), accompanied the first dispatch of material to the printer in Bristol, John Gutch. The work at issue is clearly intended for Sibylline Leaves , for Morgan explains that the delay in sending the remainder of the manuscript has been caused by an allegedly minor difficulty in the "prefacing work," an essay already of such length as to astonish Morgan ("you will see how rediculous it wo d be to call it preface"). We may surmise that the "57 sides" sent to Bristol by Morgan in early August included some poems and, as Coleridge's letter to Gutch of 17 September indicates (Q), the first three chapters of the Biographia . "The rest," wrote Morgan, "(full 100 sides) is finished, and not finished— . . . there is a metaphysical part of about 5 or 6 sheets which must be revised or rather re-written." By "5 or 6 sheets" Morgan might have meant ten or twelve sides of manuscript or "5 or 6 sheets" of octavo forms, comprising eighty or ninety-six pages. The first alternative seems the more probable, first because Morgan, a layman, is unlikely to have used "sheets" in its technical printer's sense, second because Morgan, by his own account "no dreamer" ("my facts are not ideas you know"), is unlikely to have trusted the unpredictable Coleridge to rewrite close to a hundred printed pages in only "a few days." 17 The notes in this letter and also in that of 14 August (M) about duplicating the design of Wordsworth's latest Preface are a further indication that Coleridge still intended his "Autobiographia literaria" as a "prefacing work" to Sibylline Leaves in the style of the famous Preface to which he saw himself as responding. Here, as throughout our story, we find reaction to Wordsworth a major shaping force on the Biographia . On 17 August, the date of the third August letter (N), Morgan still expects to post the remaining material for Sibylline Leaves in short order. But mid-September would pass before the work was complete. On 17 September (Q), Coleridge announces to Gutch a radical change in the plan he had more or less held to since March. He freely admits that the August promises of additional material for the press were a consequence of his self-delusion "with the belief, that I should have finished &amp; be able to write myself [i.e., rather than Morgan in his stead] in the course of a few days." Presumably the work which remained to be done on August 10, the revision of "5 or 6 sheets," had led to a further, demanding expansion of the preface to the poems, so much so that it is now, in mid-September, "not a Preface, nor any thing in the Nature of a Preface, but a Work per se: I would fain have it printed in chapters." It has become, moreover, "the main work," for Coleridge has resolved not to print "Poems and a Preface" but instead to issue "Biographical Sketches of my LITER-ARY LIFE, Principles and Opinions, chiefly on the subjects of Poetry and Philosophy, and the Differences at present prevailing concerning them both: by S. T. Coleridge. To which are added , Sibylline Leaves , or a Collection of Poems, by the same Author." 18 The new stress on philosophy suggests that it was the enlargement of the "metaphysical part" of the Sibylline Leaves preface in August and the first half of September of 1815 which changed the piece into "a Work per se." And Coleridge's retraction of the August requests to emulate the design of Wordsworth's Preface encourages the conclusion that his notion of the "Autobiographia literaria" as an analogue to his friend's work had also changed in the intervening weeks. 19 Probably on 19 September, the entire manuscript was sent to Bristol. In letters of 29 September and 7 October (R and S) Coleridge says the work has passed wholly out of his hands and into the printer's. "I have delivered compleat to my printer . . . the Mss of two Volumes octavo," he tells John May. And on 15 October (T), he informs Byron that the two volumes "are now entire in the printer's possession." Although he was not yet done with the project conceived in March of 1815, he thought that he was. Only an unfortunate miscalculation extended his labor beyond the reading of the proofsheets, which began to come to him in October. Printing of the Biographia began in October, 1815, that of Sibylline Leaves a month later ( CL , IV, xlix). Before pursuing the narration, I should like to set down what seems to me, on the basis of the evidence underlying the foregoing account, the most probable reconstruction of the evolution of the Biographia in 1815. In March, Coleridge made a plan to issue his poems in two volumes, with a preface. But the preface, which at the end of May still promised to be a short essay, confined him to his study throughout June and July, when he probably wrote the critique of Wordsworth (Chapters XIV-XXI and certainly the first thirteen pages of Chapter XXII) and at least the first three chapters of Volume I. 20 To the production of June and July we can probably add Chapter IV—which in addition to being a natural antecedent to Chapter XIV introduces the Fancy-Imagination distinction— and Chapter V. It is likely that Chapter V, headed "On the law of association—Its history traced from Aristotle to Hartley," was behind Coleridge's description to Brabant of the philosophical portion of his extension of the preface, "just finished" on 29 July. He must have realized, though, that Chapter V barely scratched the surface of his philosophical concerns, yet for a curiously long time he misled himself as well as Morgan in the belief that the "metaphysical part of 5 and 6 sheets" (probably not much more than the present Chapter V) could be revised in a few days. Accordingly, when Morgan urged him to give the printer manuscript from which he could begin setting type, Coleridge allowed only what became Chapters I-III out of his hands. That he would have held onto Chapter IV in contemplating expansion of Chapter V is understandable, since he did not yet see the "Autobiographia" as "a Work per se" and had therefore failed to divide it into chapters. He would have wanted to keep with him the material immediately preceding what became Chapter V in his anxiety not to send to press manuscript which might require important revision. As it turned out, rewriting the "metaphysical part" entailed so great an enlargement of the intended preface that Coleridge's conception of the work had changed irrevocably by 17 September. He must have written his opening comment about the "miscellaneous reflections" of the Biographia , therefore, before 10 August. But the more pointed "immethodical miscellany" remark occurs at the end of Chapter X and must have been written after Coleridge had transformed the scope of his text. What would have been first drafted in August and September, then, were Chapters VI through XIII, part of Chapter V certainly, and part of Chapter IV in all probability. 21 As we have seen, Coleridge was under fierce pressure from Gutch and Morgan to send the Biographia to press. Surely it was this pressure, as he sped to complete Chapters XII and XIII—the last of the Biographia he produced in 1815—that forced Coleridge to plunder Schelling's Abhandlungen as he did in Chapter XII. The anxiety about having fallen so far behind his deadline may also account, in part at least, for the odd, evasive letter to "C." in Chapter XIII. Since Chapter XII refers to the date "this morning (16 September 1815)" and since Coleridge sent the Biographia manuscript "compleat," as he then thought, "to my printer" on 19 September, we can be sure that Chapters XII and XIII were turned out at white heat. Gutch also must have thought the work complete, for, in a letter of December, 1816 (Z), he threatened to issue the book himself as it had first been sent to him. Printing of the Biographia went on from the fall of 1815 through the early spring of 1816, when it was discovered that the two volumes (the Biographia and Sibylline Leaves ) would be of unequal length. Coleridge later blamed Gutch for "the blunder" of deciding to issue the work in three volumes of equal size (Z). But Morgan's letter of 6 May 1816 indicates that the decision to divide the Biographia into two volumes was collective; Coleridge, who had accurately computed the length of both the poems and the Biographia (in G and U), was no less to blame than Gutch for not realizing that the Biographia manuscript of 1815 would fall considerably short of two volumes of 300 pages each (see also letters X and Y). Coleridge's disgust was extreme. He so exacerbated relations with Gutch that the printing in Bristol came to a halt in the fall of 1816, at the end of page 144 of Volume II. The manuscript, along with the sheets already printed, would have to be sent to Coleridge's London publisher, Gale &amp; Fenner, with whom he had contracted in the summer of 1816 (W). Gale &amp; Fenner could then see the book through to completion. But Gutch refused to send the materials he held until financial accounts were settled. This held up the entire project until the spring of 1817, when Gutch at last surrendered the manuscript and printed sheets. In September of 1816, Coleridge wrote of starting on the extra material needed to fill out Volume II of the Biographia (Z), but he did not complete this task until the spring of 1817 (II, MM). 22 At one point he apparently considered filling out the Biographia with Zapolya , but a prior commitment of the play to John Murray forced him to use "Satyrane's Letters" and the critique of Bertram instead (EE, HH). He would then have had to revise at least the last page of Chapter XXII. Watson's speculation that he padded throughout the latter portion of XXII is at least possible on the basis of what we now know, as is his supposition about the Conclusion, which he says was made up in 1817 of parts of the old ending of Chapter XXII and of new material in response to attacks on Coleridge in the autumn 1816 numbers of the Edinburgh Review ( BL -Watson, pp. xvii-xviii). By 22 July 1817 (KK), Sibylline Leaves and the Biographia Literaria had been published. 23 Coleridge's composition of most of the Biographia in three and a half months in 1815 was an astounding feat of concentration and energy. Doubtless John Morgan, who took dictation from Coleridge, was indispensable to the effort. "Possibly," Kathleen Coburn observes, "the albatross fell off into the sea when John Morgan, acting as amanuensis, extracted the Biographia from Coleridge, almost by force, in 1815." 24 But the extraordinary effort of will and intellect was Coleridge's. It is time that we bury for good the account of the Biographia 's composition as "a story of ludicrous dilatoriness." 25 And such recent statements as M. G. Cooke's that Coleridge "balked" at the end of Chapter XIII, "accidentally turning to Wordsworth and opinions on poetry" and away "from his proper subject of the nature and function of the imagination" 26 ought now, at best, to be taken figuratively; after all, it appears most likely that Coleridge turned from Wordsworth and opinions on poetry to the "subject of the nature and function of the imagination." As George Whalley suggested twenty years ago, the more one reads the Biographia , the more one sees the intimate relation of the "metaphysical part" to the practical criticism of Wordsworth. That Coleridge spent two months adding the metaphysical part to a work which he could have passed off as finished demonstrates that from his standpoint the philosophy of Volume I of the Biographia was an essential foundation for the assessment of Wordsworth's poems, theory, and poetry in Volume II. In dealing with the story of the Biographia , we are forced to go beyond the ambiguities of the evidence into the realm of conjecture. Working with possibilities and probabilities, we cannot claim certainty for our conclusions, and so the role of the textual historian is reduced (or perhaps raised) to advocacy of supposition and conjecture. The future insertion of a single new fact into the array of evidence may alter the matter only slightly or else may force us wholly to revise our estimates of the probabilities and give us new insight into the compositional history of the Biographia . The reconstruction offered here confirms Griggs in his reading of the letter to Dr. Brabant and in his dating of the composition of the greater portion of Volume I after that of Volume II but is considerably more explicit in identifying the particular chapters of the Biographia assignable to each stage of the development of the text. Coleridge's letter of 17 September in particular reinforces my sense of the sequence: it could only have been shortly before writing to Gutch on that date—and not, as Griggs suggests, "not long after writing to Wordsworth" in May ( CL , III, xlvii)—that Coleridge grasped the nature of the changes his work had undergone from preface, to prefacing "Autobiographia literaria," to the Biographia Literaria , a separate title in its own right. It would be illuminating to know the fate of the proofsheets of the Biographia , particularly if, like the proofsheets of Sibylline Leaves , they contain "numerous revisions and corrections" by Coleridge ( CL , IV, 618). We shall be able to distinguish the passages that were dictated to John Morgan from those penned by Coleridge only if someone turns up the missing manuscript of the Biographia . But unless and until new information does turn up, the foregoing reconstruction of the birth of the Biographia would seem the most probable and detailed possible. Coleridge's great critical work emerged from a thicket of tangled designs and intentions. Reviewing the evidence about the making of the text, one recalls William Hazlitt's report that Coleridge liked "to compose in walking over uneven ground, or breaking through the straggling branches of a copsewood." 27 The present account of the composition of the Biographia , based on all the facts now known to me, not only illuminates major problems raised by the text but also constitutes a chapter in the astonishing story of Coleridge's breakthrough into the productive period of his middle years.</field>

The introductory materials of 1965 stand unaltered in Watson's recent (1975) reissue of this edition. The introduction to the latter is a reprint, with minor alterations (see n. 15, below), of Professor Watson's 1956 introduction to the Biographia , to which is added a brief "Note (1965)" in response to the arguments advanced by E. L. Griggs in 1959 (see n. 2, below). 2 Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , ed. Earl Leslie Griggs (1956-1971), IV, 578. Following citations to CL are to this edition. 3 CL , III, xlviii. 4 The name of the publishing firm, Gale &amp; Fenner, had by this time been changed to Rest Fenner. 5 See Whalley's "The Integrity of the Biographia Literaria " in Essays and Studies , 6 (1953), 85-101. 6 "Wordsworth and Coleridge on Diction and Figures," English Institute Essays , 1952, ed. Alan S. Downer (1965), pp. 184-185. 7 "Integrity," p. 92. 8 This is not to say that Coleridge was not often preoccupied, in the intervening years, with the same concerns he expressed in the Biographia . That his speculations developed over a long period is amply attested to in the latest Notebooks and in Professor Coburn's notes. Commenting on an entry of 1808 which attributes to poetry "the production of [the most del. ] as great immediate pleasure in each part, as is compatible with the largest possible Sum of pleasure in the whole," Coburn remarks that "the materials for BL go back a long way, making it what he projected in 1803" ( CN , III, 3286 and 3286n.). She crossreferences this 1808 entry with entries of 1811 (cited as "E" in the tabular synopsis above) that Coleridge clearly transported four years later to Chapter XIV. Indeed, Coburn points out scores of correspondences between passages in the Notebooks and in the Biographia . Some of these contain favorite quotations and aphorisms (e.g. CN , III, 3335 and 4248). In only a few cases, however, when quotations appear in the Biographia with omissions and variations parallel to those Coleridge made in entering the passage in an earlier notebook, are there grounds for supposing that he returned to the notebook entry in composing the Biographia (e.g. CN , 3750 and 3537). Other Notebook entries may be said to foreshadow Coleridge's argument in the Biographia . In an 1813 entry, he opposes "Eisenoplasy or esenoplastic Power" to "Fantasy" ( CN , 4176). In an 1808 entry, he coins the term "psilosophy" ( CN , 3244n.). But, important as such notes are for students of the Biographia , they lie beyond the scope of the present study: here I can deal only with entries in the Notebooks which intentionally adumbrate the Biographia , like the cited note of 1803 (D), or which were almost certainly before Coleridge as he worked on the Biographia in 1815, like the cited notes of 1811 and 1815 (E and P). See notes 20, 21, and 22 below. 9 Hood's account of money advanced to Coleridge in 1815 is among the Victoria College papers transcribed by Professor Whalley. It reads as follows: Mr Hood's Account Cash advanced S. T. Coleridge to be paid by sale of his book 1815 April paid his annuity to J ?P. Hinckley &amp; Co in London 27.5.6 His draft &amp; Cash in Bristol 45.0.0 -------- 72.5.6 Oct Cash note to Calne to enable him to send his son Hartley to Oxford 10.0.0 Dec 9 paid his draft at 2 months dated Calne to relieve him from anxiety regarding some debts &amp; to enable him thus to compleat his Work 25.0.0 ----- £107.5.6 10 Coleridge hoped that he could write new poems to make up a second volume. As he was unable to do so, Sibylline Leaves appeared in one only volume. 11 See CL , IV, 563 for Byron's understanding reply to Coleridge. 12 I wish to express my gratitude to Professor H. Peter Kahn, of the Department of Art History at Cornell University, with whom I examined Professor Abrams's copy of the first edition of the Biographia . I wanted to know if there was evidence beyond the Gutch account and the signature change cited by Griggs which identifies the parts of the book printed in Bristol and London (see CL , IV, 658-59). Professor Kahn pointed out that the font of type used in Bristol is thinner and less vertical than the London font. In addition, the Bristol printer, John Evans, to whom Gutch farmed the work out, used too much oil in his ink and persistently overinked his press. Afterwards, I looked at copies of the 1817 Biographia in the collections at Cornell, Yale, and the New York Public Library. These all confirm that the Bristol printing stopped at the end of signature II, page 144 of Volume II. In all of the copies, furthermore, watermarks first appear early in signature HH, go on into signature II, and continue through the signatures printed in London. The watermark in signatures HH and II has the letters "C &amp; C" above the date "1815." The watermarks from signature KK onwards (the first London signature) show only dates, the numerals of which are larger than the "1815" in signatures HH and II. From signature LL onwards, the watermark date "1815" is replaced by "1816." 13 "Unpublished Letters written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge," Westminster Review , 37 (1870), 361. 14 Whalley's argument on this point appears in the notes he made with his transcripts of the Biographia correspondence at Victoria College. (See my note following the list of documents in Section II above). 15 But surely there is no warrant, in any case, for Watson's version of the sentence. Even in the 1965 revision of his edition, when he inserted the proper commas in his quotation of the first sentence of the letter of 29 July 1815, he regularized the capitalization of what he took to be a title and he placed it in italics: "The necessity of extending, what I first intended as a preface, to an Autobiographia Literaria , or Sketches of my Literary Life and Opinions , as far as . . ." This, on Mr. Watson's part, is wishful typography. 16 Coleridge may, in fact, have dictated these letters in whole or in part. The letters do not seem to me, however, to be in Coleridge's style. Other letters by Morgan, for instance 6 May 1816 to Gutch, contain phrasing which is unmistakably Coleridge's. 17 I would guess that Morgan uses the count of "sides" in order to exaggerate the work completed, the count of "sheets" (half the number of sides) in order to diminish the apparent amount of work still to be done. 18 As indicated in the tabular synopsis of the compositional history of the Biographia , the change in Coleridge's thinking may have occurred between 10 and 20 August. Here is Mary Lamb's phrasing as she quotes Mrs. Morgan's description of Coleridge's work in her letter of 20 August 1815 (O): "The title of it is ' Autobiographia Literaria ' to which are added ' Sibylline Leaves ,' a collection of Poems by the same author." This sentence is so similar to Coleridge's titling of the work in his letter of 17 September that it is evident Coleridge must at least have discussed before 20 August 1815 such a change in the comparative importance of the Biographia and Sibylline Leaves . 19 "The Type and Size of the Preface in the first Volume of Wordsworth's recent collection of his poems pleased my friends here," Coleridge wrote to Gutch on 17 September 1815, "but I think it rather too open and naked for a Book." 20 Coburn has identified Notebook entries of 1811 which Coleridge clearly had open before him in writing Chapter XIV of the Biographia (E). Perhaps Coleridge planned, as he began the "Preface" to Sibylline Leaves , to rely heavily on such borrowings from his own notes. As it turned out, he apparently did not take very much of the Biographia directly from the Notebooks (see, however, notes 8 above and 21 below). Nevertheless, if he at first thought he might do so, then that notion, especially in view of the brevity of the essay he initially planned, might go a long way toward explaining his confident expectation, on 30 May 1815, of finishing in two or three days. 21 In Notebook entry 4265, Professor Coburn has identified the most striking of the three entries which Coleridge almost certainly had before him in composing the Biographia . A series of philosophical propositions, the entry parallels the Theses in Chapter XII. "Coleridge," Coburn says, "probably had this notebook in his hands while dictating to Morgan (and, as argued below, a copy of Schelling's Abhandlungen as well)" ( CN , III, 4265n.). 22 Professor Coburn, to be sure, refers (in CN , III, 4262n.) to "matter added in Sept-October 1816." Coleridge promised to add matter then, but his letters to Curtis of April and May 1817 suggest he did not in fact do so until later on. Coburn in the main seems to follow Griggs's suggestions about the history of the Biographia , so much so that a close connection between a notebook entry of uncertain date and the subject-matter of Chapter IX is evidence for her assigning the entry the probable date August-September 1815 ( CN , III, 4258n.). Interestingly, in a short review of Griggs's 1959 volumes ( Modern Philology 57 [1960], 264-268), she found fault with "the long editorial description of the Biographia Literaria and The Friend (which cannot be fully treated from the letters in any case but require various other documents which must be fully dealt with eventually by editors of these works)." 23 Professor Griggs provides a detailed account of the business dealings involved in production of the Biographia in CL , III, xlvii-li and in IV, 657-660n. 24 The quotation is from Professor Coburn's short review of CL , Modern Language Review , 55 (1960), 596-597. 25 Quoted from Arthur Quiller-Couch's introduction to Biographia Literaria : Chapters I-IV , XIV-XXII , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">Printer's Copy for Part of Volume Seven of the W. B. Yeats Collected Works in Verse and Prose (1908) by J. R. Mulryne</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the papers associated with A. H. Bullen now in the Records Office of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust at Stratford-upon-Avon is an envelope containing unbound sheets from the second edition (1891) of W. B. Yeats's John Sherman and Dhoya . 1 Bullen was involved with Yeats in the publication of Yeats's Collected Works in Verse and Prose (1908), printed at Bullen's Shakespeare Head Press in Stratford. The papers in question relate to that venture, for these sheets, with textual revisions by Yeats, and some annotation by Bullen, served as printer's copy for part of volume seven of the Collected Works . Yeats's revision of his early story, John Sherman , which these pages represent, was scarcely a thoroughgoing one, nor, as I shall indicate below, was it his last revision before the Collected Works were finally published. Yet these sheets and their annotations are of considerable interest in allowing a glimpse of Yeats working on printer's copy for an edition by which he set great store. The envelope contains, in addition to a blank flysheet, pp. i-iv, 1-170 of the 1891 second edition of John Sherman and Dhoya ; 2 that is to say, the pages covering the John Sherman story alone, together with title pages and some preliminary material. The pages relating to the story called Dhoya (pp. 171-196) have not been preserved. A description of the annotations in the papers follows below; all annotations are in ink, unless otherwise stated. I have given page and line references first to the 1891 John Sherman and Dhoya ( JSD ); then, where appropriate, to volume seven of the Collected Works ( CW ); and finally, because neither of these is readily available outside large libraries, to the edition of John Sherman and Dhoya by Richard J. Finneran (1969) ( F ). The first of these unbound sheets is blank ( JSD fly-leaf), with a pencilled '1' on recto and '2' on verso. There follows the half-title page (JOHN SHERMAN | AND | DHOYA; JSD [i]), numbered '3' in pencil, and signed in Yeats's autograph across the top of the page 'W B Yeats November 1891'. 3 The verso page (list of Pseudonym Library books; JSD [ii]) carries pencilled number '4'. The title page (GANCONAGH | [rule] | JOHN SHERMAN | AND | DHOYA | SECOND EDITION | [Publisher's details at foot]; JSD [iii]) carries a pencilled number '5'. Yeats's handwritten 'Two Early Stories' at the top of the page has been roughly cancelled; so too has 'GANCONAGH', and (as part of the same cancellation) the signature 'W B Yeats' immediately below. Faint single inverted commas in ink around 'GANCONAGH' are just discernible. 4 Following 'DHOYA' Bullen has written in a colon, and, immediately below, 'Two Early Stories'. The rest of the page has been roughly cancelled. On the verso of this leaf ( JSD [iv]) is the number '6' in pencil, and in Bullen's hand 'Republished by courteous permission of Mr. T. Fisher Unwin'. The following recto page ( JSD [1]) is numbered '7' in pencil, but the whole page (GANCONAGH'S APOLOGY) is cancelled by a single-line diagonally down the page, with Yeats's (?) delete symbol in the margin. The verso page ( JSD 2) is pencil-numbered '8', but is also cancelled, and again carries Yeats's (?) delete symbol. The fly-title page that follows (PART I. | JOHN SHERMAN LEAVES | BALLAH. ; JSD [3]) has the roman 'I' cancelled and 'First' written-in in Bullen's hand. A further note in Bullen's hand reads 'transfer to top of next page'. The page is numbered '9' in pencil. The verso is blank ( JSD [4]), and is pencil-numbered '10'. (The following pages are numbered, in pencil as throughout, as far as '12' ( JSD 6), after which the numbering ceases.) The notes below record all the corrections to the text of John Sherman ; all are in Yeats's hand, unless otherwise indicated. A few printer's marks (in the form of a rule across the page and in the margin 'slip 4', 'slip 5', 'slip 6', 'slip 13', JSD 21, 27, 32, 76) have been omitted.

Yeats's revisions go in exactly as he directs, with the exception that 'antimacassar' is correctly spelled. Bullen's annotations, too, are respected, except that 'courteous permission' (see JSD [iv]) becomes in the printed text 'kind permission', and 'PART FIRST' ( JSD [3]) becomes 'FIRST PART'—which may indeed have been Bullen's intention. Bullen worked very closely with his printers, and we need not suppose that these slight changes represent any departure from his directions. The pencilled annotations ( JSD 49 and 146) are also respected. The textual revisions in this printer's copy represent a very light re-working of material Yeats had come, by 1906-1908, to regard almost as prentice work. The sub-heading, 'Two Early Stories', presumably offers to deflect adverse criticism, but this is the only sign that the poet felt in any way defensive about the fiction written more than fifteen years before. Such revisions as he makes are normally towards simplifying his tale's vocabulary, and rendering it less self-conscious and showy—in keeping with the trend of Yeats's other work at this period. The most substantial change gets rid of a rather gauche anthropomorphism ( JSD [51]): the clothes-moth who, according to the early version, 'thought that the end of the world had come' before taking to the air, resumes in the Collected Works his animal decorum and, we are told, merely 'fluttered out of an antimacassar'. In a similar if less vivid way, the beetle who in JSD 'crawled out of his hole' ( JSD 25), now 'crawled out of its hole'. The rather showy (and obscure) Gaelic word ' gluggerabunthaun ' (breezily translated by Finneran as 'emptyrattling-arse' 6 ) is deleted, presumably because the expected English readership of the Collected Works would simply not understand it ( JSD 15). The change from 'Inniscrewin' to 'Innisfree' ( JSD 123) lies in the direction of demystifying the tale and giving it a real location; one presumes that the larger change of the same kind, replacing 'Ballah' by 'Sligo', would have required too much cancellation, and would have led to other (and possibly unacceptable) re-naming. If Mrs. Sheelah Kirby is right in identifying the Old Cummen House as the house by which John Sherman walks in the fifth part of the book (Finneran, p. 136), then the change from 'south' to 'west' ( JSD 165) is one of topographical exactness: in keeping perhaps with Yeats's insistence to Katharine Tynan that in this book he worked very closely and exactly with things Irish. 7 The 1891 description of 'unsympathetic' people who 'preserve their characters in an iron safe' ( JSD 151) must have seemed to the later Yeats to suggest an absurd little drama of putting away and locking up; such people keeping their characters in an 'iron bottle' may have appeared a less ludicrous image. The correction 'on' to 'or' ( JSD 130) is a simple correction of a printer's error, already put right in the New York edition of JSD , dated, like the two English editions, 1891. Yeats's other alterations are of little significance, representing merely an editor's tidying-up of the text in front of him. One caveat emerges from a study of these papers. Professor Finneran, comparing printed versions of John Sherman , notes (p. 34) that 'in a few places . . . Yeats attempted [through revision] to produce a tighter sentence structure by eliminating unnecessary words and altering the syntax'. The one example of a genuine tightening of syntax in the present papers ( JSD 49, l. 3) comes in an entry by a hand other than Yeats's (or at least in an unidentified hand). Of course, Yeats may have initiated, authorised or accepted the change. Yet it may be as well to remember, when commenting on apparent Yeats revisions between printed editions, that not all the changes, even of syntax, may in actual fact be his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The Bullen papers we have examined obviously served as printer's copy for the Collected Works , and all the changes there made are incorporated into the published text. Comparison of JSD with the Collected Works establishes, however, that a further revision intervened before the 1908 text of John Sherman reached the public. We can only conjecture how and when this took place. The relationship between Yeats and Bullen during the period when the Collected Works were going through the press was not always a smooth one. Various difficulties presented themselves, exacerbated by Yeats's frequent absences in Ireland and elsewhere, and, it seems, by Bullen's tendency to meddle with the poet's text. Yeats insisted on precise and continuous oversight of his work as it went through the press; Bullen, always in financial straits, had to think in terms of keeping his men employed even if the poet's final word on a particular piece of work had not come through. The tension over this matter reached a high point in the summer of 1907. Writing from Coole Park on July 6 of that year, Yeats says: If this Library Edition is not to be carried through on the ordinary conditions I prefer that it should come to an end immediately. I will not have one word printed that I have not seen and passed. . . . I told you that I would not require to see proofs but after your letter I withdraw that. I must see final proofs of everything, and other proofs if I ask for them. This will be my final text for many years, and I refuse to have any portion of that text settled by any person but myself. 8 Unless we construe this as mere bluster, we may take it that Yeats would see and approve each stage in the printing of volume 7 of the Collected Works , going through the press during the following year, 1908. Among the changes introduced into the text of John Sherman at a stage later than Yeats's preparation of copy for the printer are some that are of significance; it seems very improbable that Yeats would have tolerated their introduction by anyone but himself. We may assume that these changes were in fact made by Yeats as he read the volume in proof. The nature of the changes at proof stage can best be shown by citing a few examples, with some brief commentary on each. The list is not complete, even in the matter of substantive changes, and entirely ignores accidentals. A full collation of the Collected Works printing against the English and American editions of JSD will be found in Professor Finneran's work. JSD 10, ll. 19-20 the last evening gnats, making circles on the water beneath] CW 187 l. 6 has 'evening flies' in place of 'evening gnats' ( F 45, l. 33); Yeats must have felt this change lay in the direction of factual accuracy. JSD 15, ll. 4-5 among the provincial youths he felt recherché ] CW 190, l. 11 has 'distinguished' for ' recherché ' ( F 48, l. 1). Yeats probably felt that the French word might well have misleading connotations for his English readers; though it could mean 'refined', the sense of 'far-fetched' or 'odd' was strong in English usage. JSD 49, ll. 27-29 she would have been more circumspect about revealing her tastes] CW 211, l.18 has 'cautious' for 'circumspect' ( F 62 l. 20). Yeats may have thought the original sentence clumsy and with too many emphatic sibilants. JSD [111], ll. 10-11 She scolded him roundly for having answered] CW 247, l. 15 omits 'roundly', Yeats presumably thinking it redundant, and preferring plainness. JSD [134], ll. 16-17 "I have been reading that sweet 'Imitation of Christ'] CW 261, l. 23 has 'the' in place of 'that sweet'. The ridiculous phrase must have seemed a crude and cheap way of making a character-point by the time Yeats came to revise the CW proofs. These changes may be said broadly to continue the process begun in the original preparation of copy for the printer. Yeats maintains his concern with the details of expression, and works further in the direction of simplifying his vocabulary. Yet here, as one might perhaps expect, he turns his attention also towards such matters as characterisation and accuracy of detail. At no point does the revision look like a comprehensive one, yet it might be thought characteristic of Yeats that the first level of reconsideration is mainly verbal in character, and only then does the poet's mind turn to other matters. Yet even this view would have to be modified in the light of the evidence here presented; the distinction is not a clear one. John Sherman is a minor work, and the revision exemplified by the printer's copy at Stratford is far less extensive and revealing than some of the manuscript and typescript revisions of Yeats material recent scholarship has turned up. Examination of the Stratford papers may, however, be of considerable value in dealing with other bibliographical problems of the Yeats canon that call for a knowledge of Yeats's practice in marking up copy for his printers.</field>

The envelope is headed: 'SHP Projected works. YEATS, W. B. John Sherman and Dhoya. [8. 1906?] 63.' I am grateful to Mr. Robert Bearman, Senior Archivist at the Records Office, for help in locating these papers, and to Dr. Levi Fox, Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, for permission to discuss them. 2 The 'second edition' is a simple reissue of the first, without textual alteration. Wade, Bibliography , quotes A. J. A. Symons, A Bibliography of the First Editions of Books by William Butler Yeats (1924), to the effect that the first edition comprised 1644 copies in paper and 356 in cloth. This issue was, it seems, almost immediately exhausted; Yeats writes with delight to John O'Leary about the financial success of his first venture into prose fiction (see The Letters of W. B. Yeats , ed. Allan Wade [1956], pp. 167, 181.) 3 The date is interesting. Wade, Bibliography , says the first edition appeared in November, 1891. If this is correct, and if Yeats's dating is accurate, the second edition must have been available almost immediately. Finneran, p. 33, notes that review copies of the first edition must have been available 'by at least October of that year'. Possibly Unwins were encouraged to reprint on the strength of favourable review opinion. 4 'Ganconagh' is the pseudonym under which Yeats first published the two stories; he made little attempt, however, to conceal his authorship, regarding the pseudonym as merely a whim of the series of books to which he was contributing. 5 Finneran, p. 102, misses this emendation in collating the first edition against the Collected Works . 6 Finneran, p. 34; for Professor Brendan P.

I am grateful to Mr. Paul Morgan of the Bodleian Library for information, as yet unpublished, on Bullen's conduct of the Shakespeare Head Press.

      <field name="heading_text">Robert Frost's "Kitty Hawk" by Joan St.C. Crane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Robert Frost's Collected Poems (1930) was in work at the Spiral Press in the fall of 1929, Joseph Blumenthal, founder and operator of the press, had the idea to print Frost's poem, 'Christmas Trees' (printed first in Mountain Interval , 1916), as a Christmas keepsake booklet for himself and Frost's publisher, Henry Holt and Company, in an edition of 275 copies. 'Christmas Trees' and subsequent similar printings of Frost poems in the Decembers of 1934 and 1935 were forerunners to an annual custom of Robert Frost Christmas booklets by the Spiral Press which continued from 1937 to 1962 with a hiatus between 1939 and 1944. By 1962, the number of copies of the annual printing had increased to 17,055. Of the twenty-five Spiral booklets issued over a period of thirty-four years, sixteen were poems written expressly for the purpose or, at least, were poems previously unpublished. In 1956, Frost provided 'Kitty Hawk,' a poem written in 1954, to be used as the Christmas poem. Frost wrote three versions of 'Kitty Hawk' over a period of eight years. The first and shortest (128 lines) was used as the 1956 card; the second, much expanded (432 lines), was printed in The Atlantic Monthly (November 1957). A new poem of 64 lines with the title, 'The Great Event is Science. The Great Misgiving, The Fear of God, Is That the Meaning of It Shall Be Lost,' was printed in The Saturday Review (21 March 1959). This poem contained 33 lines excerpted from the second version and 31 new lines. The final version, having 471 lines, was printed in In The Clearing (1962). It incorporates the 64-line poem in its entirety, discards some sections of the second version and contains additional text. In the Frost canon, 'Kitty Hawk' was considered by the poet to be one of his most important later works. The poem is a profession of faith in the spirit of man, in his ultimate spiritual triumph over the phenomena of creation. The effort to understand and interpret the nature of the universe by means of exploration, enterprise, invention and technology, which Frost called 'duffing into the material' at a talk before the Poetry Society in 1958, lies at the heart of this gradually-evolved poem. In the examination of the versions of 'Kitty Hawk' that follows, the designations 1 (1956 Christmas card), 2 ( Atlantic Monthly ), 3 ( Saturday Review ), and 4 ( In The Clearing ) are used. All lines cited from version 1 are keyed to the original text. Lines quoted from the later versions are keyed to the numbered text, deriving from 4, that is printed in Edward Connery Lathem's The Poetry of Robert Frost (Barre, Mass.: The Imprint Society, 1971, pp. 428-443). The themes in the original version were two that fascinated Frost all his life: the phenomenon of flight by man and the belief that the world of men is a place to get away from by any means—love, art, nature, science or religion. As early as 1917, Frost used this conviction as his topic in talks, quoting from 'poems which represented romantic notions of escape from this world by means of scientific inventions and discoveries such as the flying machine of Darius Green. . . .' 1 Frost had met John Townsend Trowbridge at the first meeting of the Poetry Club of New England in 1915 when the author of 'Darius Green and His Flying Machine' 2 was 88. The reasons for Frost's delight in the poem are fairly obvious: it is the tale of an eccentric, visionary, hard-headed Yankee boy whose determination to fly overcomes ridicule, scorn, and a total lack of aerodonetic know-how; who allows, when his flight is accomplished, '"Wal, I like flyin' well enough," / He said; "but the' ain't sich a thunderin' sight / O' fun in 't when ye come to light."' Robert Frost was 29 years old, a farmer in Derry, N.H., when Wilbur and Orville Wright made their historic 59-second flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903. Sometime in the thirties, Frost said to Louis Mertins, 'Anybody who knows even a kindergarten course in my poetry knows that I've been interested in flying ever since Kitty Hawk gave us success under the Wright brothers. . . . I've been trying to do my little stint for the Wrights in deeds and verse a long time. . . . I always remember the die-hards who said nobody could ever fly—there'd be no Darius Green and his flying machine. The newspapers, whose editors always know everything, back at the century's turn said no use to send a man down . . . to Kitty Hawk. You can't cover what can't happen. So, the biggest event of the century, up to then, had nobody to write it up.' Mertins also writes: 'I recall how greatly exercised Frost was over the fact that the encyclopedias were trying to take the honor of the first heavier-than-air flight away from the Wright brothers. "Why," he sputtered, "when all this thing is written, that about Lindburgh and all, there will still remain only the Wright boys, the Columbuses of the air. . . . I wanted to do all I could to help establish them in their rights. So I wrote a poem about our long having wheel rights, wainwrights, and now we've got wingwrights. I want to print it and do what I can to help."' 3 It was this poem, published in A Further Range (1936) with the title, 'The Wrights' Biplane.' His comparison of the Wrights with Columbus goes back to 1906 when Frost was teaching at the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, N.H. The Clifton Waller Barrett Library at the University of Virginia has in its Robert Frost manuscript holdings a notebook that survives from the Derry period. In it are notes, apparently intended for a class lesson, in which Frost postulates the importance of the Wrights' achievement in terms of Columbus's voyage: 'Why is he [Columbus] immortal, then? Can't you tell? Well, because he had the faith that so few people are capable of; the faith of an idea. Not for him to feel his way around Africa to Ind[ia]. He launched out into space with the supreme confidence of reason. Great in his confidence, great in his justification. The nearest him [are] among the aviators and the only ones near him are the Wright brothers.' 4 Frost and Orville Wright met and became friends a few years before the pioneer aviator died in 1948. In the later versions of 'Kitty Hawk' he refers to Orville Wright as 'The Master': 'Once I told the Master, / Later when we met, / I'd been here one night / As a young Alastor / When the scene was set / For some kind of flight / Long before he flew it' [4:50-56]. This reference establishes the milieu of the poem. Frost had been at Kitty Hawk ten years before the historic flight on a personal and emotional 'flight' of his own. Lawrance Thompson ( Early Years , pp. 173-189) gives a vivid account of the runaway excursion to the Dismal Swamp in 1894 after Elinor White discouraged his courtship. He tore up his own copy of Twilight (the booklet of poems he had had printed in an edition of two copies only; one for himself and one for Elinor) and bolted. He ended up at Nags Head, near Kitty Hawk on the Outer Banks of the North Carolina coast with a party of duck hunters from Elizabeth City, N.C. [1:34-61; 4:100-128], from whose unwanted solicitude he escaped by going down alone to the ocean beach late at night [1:68-70; 4:135-138]. Having evaded the hunters, Frost was shortly accosted by an officer of the Life Saving Service patrolling the beach; a man of evangelical bent who told him the story of Aaron Burr's daughter Theodosia [1:72-94; 4: 139-161]. Frost diverted the discussion by remarking the full moon which reminded him of the lines from Tennyson's 'Morte d'Arthur,' 'On one side lay the Ocean, and on one / Lay a great water, and the moon was full.' This he quoted to his companion [1:97-104; 4:164-169], referring in the first version to Tennyson as 'That old laurel-crowned / Lord of a John Bull.' The encounter produced only a banal exchange and twice the poet claims to have been thwarted on the threshold of poetic expression by the well-meant interference of strangers: 'Getting too befriended, / As so often, ended / Any melancholy / Götterdämmerung / That I might have sung' [4:95-99]. He rationalized that the theme he might have chosen would not have been an universal one since his mood at the time inclined him more to lost causes; his own and those specific to the area of the Outer Banks like the Lost Colony of Roanoke [4:85-94]. In 1954, 5 Frost made another visit to Kitty Hawk with Huntington Cairns, the lawyer and author who acted as professional advisor to the National Gallery in Washington from 1943 to 1965. Memories stirred by this second visit sixty years later inspired the original Spiral Press Christmas booklet version of the poem. Shortly after the earlier version was printed, however, Frost was working on a much longer (432 lines), more complex treatment of the same themes, extended to incorporate the philosophical implications of space flight. This thesis is explored in an interview with Frost conducted by John Ciardi on the occasion of the poet's eighty-fifth birthday which was published in The Saturday Review (21 March 1959). In the same issue was the new poem, 'The Great Event is Science. The Great Misgiving, The Fear of God, Is That the Meaning of It Shall be Lost,' later incorporated into the final version of 'Kitty Hawk.' 6 In the interview Frost says: My theme is that the only event in all history is science plunging deeper into matter. We have plunged into the smallness of particles and we are plunging into the hugeness of space—but not without fears that the spirit shall be lost. . . . [In] taking us deeper and deeper into matter, science has left all of us with this great misgiving, this fear that we won't be able to substantiate the spirit. I've said in "Kitty Hawk": "That the supreme merit / Lay in risking spirit / In substantiation." Risk is the point. Someone asked me if I thought God could take a chance. I said it looked to me as if he had—right from the start. But only the Western world has really risked it. The people of the East had the great misgiving, but it arrested them. They drew back from the material because they weren't ready to take the dare of it. We in the West have learned to carry the misgiving—in just about the way you learn to carry liquor. I've been gathering together the poems for the book [ In The Clearing , 1962]. The main one is "Kitty Hawk," which is a longish poem in two parts. Part One is a sort of personal story, an adventure of my boyhood. I was down there once when I was about nineteen. Alone, just wandering. Then I was invited back there sixty years later. That return after so long a time suggested the poem to me. I used my own story of the place to take off into the story of the airplane. I make a figure of speech of it: How I might have taken off from my experience of Kitty Hawk and written an immortal poem, but how, instead, the Wright brothers took off from there to commit an immortality. . . . Part Two goes into the thought of the on-penetration, no more than that. And so one more cause of the misgiving we must all risk. . . . It should be remembered that when this interview was given to Ciardi in 1959, the first earth satellite, Sputnik I, had been successfully placed in orbit by the Russians in October, 1957, matched by the American achievement in January, 1958. The first manned space flights were about to become a reality in 1961. The space programs were innocent of philosophical justification and Frost set about filling the void with his 'emblematic ditty.' Versions 2 and 4 emphasize a competitive spirit that emerges first in the conversation with Orville Wright [4:59-63]. In version 2, Wright does not respond to the question about 'the lie / That he wasn't first?' [4:64-65]. In version 4, Frost was 'glad he laughed' [4:66] and proceeds into a brief historical background of the controversy that raged over the Wrights' claim to the first powered flight against earlier claims such as that of the Frenchman, Clément Ader, in 1890 and 1897. 7 But beyond the spirit of competition, he discerns an historical pattern of Westerners inheriting 'A design for living / Deeper into matter' [4:225-227]. The real event in history is the collective occupation of mankind to venture always deeper into the material, overshadowing the spirit of competition which nevertheless supplies the abrasive element that keeps us striving. This is exemplified by the space race between America and Russia which Frost seems to minimize [4:258-259, 263-269]. Yet, to remind us of our earthbound nature, Frost expostulates that 'Nothing can go up / But it must come down / Earth is still our fate' [4:306-308]; a statement reflecting Darius Green's pained observation on the inevitable conclusion of any flight by man. Nevertheless, regardless of the puniness of our first move against the vastness of the universe, it is a pre-destined beginning: 'Don't discount our powers; / We have made a pass / At the infinite' [4:361-363] and, in doing so, we have made ourselves 'the Capital / Of the universe' [4:376-377] and begin to fulfill the potential of the mens animi . What was called 'a godless adventure' in version 2 and an 'unblessed adventure' in version 3, becomes in the final version 'Our instinctive venture' into what censurious 'pulpiteers' call the material [4:213-216]. If Robert Frost felt that he had missed the flight in 1894, version 4 of the poem aspires to be his 'emblematic ditty'; this time reflecting man's greatest adventure, the momentous flight into space. 'Kitty Hawk' is Frost's affirmation of mankind attempting the infinite and hazarding thereby the death of the spirit. On the occasion of the party to celebrate his last birthday in Washington, D.C., 26 March 1962, Frost responded to the demonstration of respect by quoting these lines from 'Kitty Hawk,' which are imperative to his personally evolved philosophy [4:219-224]: But God's own descent Into flesh was meant As a demonstration That the supreme merit Lay in risking spirit In substantiation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Graham Greene's Second Thoughts: The Text of The Heart fo the Matter by David Leon Higdon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Collected editions offer an author the opportunity for self-congratulation, self-examination, and historical reflection before the volumes "put forth a hasty claim to completeness and . . . a surrender to fate of that field in which all these victories have been won." 1 Many authors, however, surrender the field only after one last skirmish in which they revise the work, either completely rewriting it as did Henry James or extensively revising it as did Joseph Conrad. 2 The collected edition of Graham Greene, now slowly accumulating on the shelves in its handsome dark green heinemann-Bodley Head bindings, presents the reader with major textual and critical problems, for, like James and Conrad, Greene systematically revised several of his novels. After noting his general dissatisfaction with the final sections of The End of the Affair , Greene comments in his "Introduction": "So it is that in this edition I have tried to return nearer to my original intention. Smythe's strawberry mark has given place to a disease of the skin which might have had a nervous origin and be susceptible to faith healing." 3 Thus the miraculous elements so obvious in the 1951 edition simply disappear in the 1974 collected edition since Greene thinks he had cheated himself, his material, and his reader: "every so-called miracle, like the curing of Parkis's boy, ought to have had a completely natural explanation" (p. ix). None of the novels, however, seems to have received more attentive revision than The Heart of the Matter . In several of the introductions to various volumes Greene voices his distress over the audience's reception of Henry Scobie. In introducing The Burnt-Out Case , he notes: "Success is more dangerous than failure . . . and The Heart of the Matter was a success in the great vulgar sense of that term. There must have been something corrupt there, for the book appealed too often to weak elements in its readers. Never have I received so many letters from strangers—perhaps the majority of these from women and priests. At a stroke I found myself regarded as a Catholic author in England, Europe and America—the last title to which I had ever aspired." 4 And in the 1971 "Introduction" to The Heart of the Matter itself, he complains, "It was to prove a book more popular with the public, even with the critics, than the author . . . The character of Scobie was intended to show that pity can be the expression of an almost monstrous pride. But I found the effect on the reader was quite different. To them Scobie was exonerated, Scobie was 'a good man,' he was hunted to his doom by the hardness of his wife." 5 Greene's estimate of audience reaction is not overstated. Anthony Burgess, himself sensitive to Catholic nuances and religious niceties, believes Scobie "is able to achieve a near-divine love" and that the reader "is convinced that Scobie, who chose evil with his eyes open, is more aware of its opposite, good, than the merely lukewarm and conventionally pious." 6 Bernard Bergonzi, too, has perceived a problematic goodness in Scobie and "a striking resmblance to Ashburnham in The Good Soldier ." 7 This discrepancy between authorial intention and audience reaction resulted, Greene believes, from "a technical fault rather than a psychological one" (p. xiii), and it is the technical fault he set out to correct when he revised the text in 1971. Scarcely a page of the novel failed to receive the imprint of Greene's desire to change his audience's reaction to Scobie. There are 23 additions—one of major length involving restoration of a manuscript chapter—, 131 deletions, and 158 changes. This extensively revised 1971 text, containing Greene's second thoughts, offers the reader an excellent opportunity to observe an author clarifying intention, satisfying his own sense of craftsmanship, and remaking his fictive reader, for, as Wayne Booth has argued, the "author creates, in short, an image of himself and another image of his reader; he makes his reader, as he makes his second self, and the most successful reading is one in which the created selves, author and reader, can find complete agreement." 8 The changes—158 in number—show Greene correcting facts, sharpening idiomatic phrasing, transposing order, and refocusing action and motivation. This cannot be claimed uniformly, for a number of changes, probably compositional in origin and overlooked in proofing, result in demonstrably inferior readings or obvious grammatical and logical errors. In the 1948 text, for example, Scobie searches the Portuguese captain's cabin, ending his search by "closing the box of French letters and putting them carefully back in the top drawer of the locker with the handkerchiefs, the gaudy ties, and the little bundle of dirty photographs" (F47.20). In the 1971 text, he puts them back in the same drawer but this time "with the handkerchiefs, the gaudy ties, and the little bundle of dirty handkerchiefs" (C43.3). Thus an emphatic detail of characterization is lost: it makes considerable difference whether the captain keeps "dirty handkerchiefs" or "dirty photographs." Since "hand-" comes at the end of consecutive lines, the compositor's eye may simply have repeated the word for him. Elsewhere, "The centenarian lifted her lip" (F69.26-27) becomes "The centenarian lifted his lip" (C62.31-32), even though the centenarian is Tallit's grandmother. Such errors as this and "Its" (C57.10) for "It's" (F63.18), "whom" (C62.13) for "who" (F69.8), and "a baths" (C64.15) for "a bath" (F71.18) suggest that the text was not proofed with the greatest accuracy. Far more often, Greene does correct his sentences. The 1948 text described "the mammies, their heads tied up in bright cotton clothes" (F183.17) while the 1971 corrected this to "cloths" (C168.19). Such phrases as "Two people's happiness were" (F207.7), "Scotch voice" (F121.1) and "I can't see nothing, sah" (F277.11) became "Two people's happiness was" (C189.4), an obvious grammatical correction, "Scottish voice" (C114.13), the generally preferred usage, and "I can see nothing, sah" (C249.37), the deletion of an awkward double negative but not necessarily an improvement since the original phrasing more accurately captured the native speaker's idiom. Many of the changes are simply indifferent: it is impossible to fathom what motivated Greene to revise "he had left for his exploration only the territory of despair" (F246.1) to "he had only left for his exploration the territory of despair" (C223.11-12), "impracticable" (F301.5) to "difficult" (C269.3), "round" (F83.33) to "around" (C81.11), or "it's" (F90.33) to "it is" (C87.21). Even in revising Yusef's unidiomatic English—"I asked him to keep his eyes—skinned—is that the right word?" (F218.33) to "I asked him to keep his eyes—bare—is that the right word?" (C199.2), Greene gains little since both words are equally inappropriate. The changes in facts are sometimes jarring to one familiar with the 1948 text, but not overly significant. For example, the Ford (F279.27) becomes a Morris (C251.34), "pink gin" (F58.16) becomes "gin-and-bitters" (C52.26), "M.I.5" (F186.24) becomes "S.O.E" (C171.13)—Greene uses both abbreviations in his 1971 "Introduction"—or "books" (F191.21) and a "bar of chocolate" (F188.13) become "bad novels" (C175.36) and a "box of chocolates" (C172.30-31). Most of the changes, by far, possess considerable significance for the novel. Near the end of Book Three, Louise cautions Scobie not to drink after midnight since they plan to attend Mass together. The 1948 Scobie thought "it was November the First—All Saint's Day, and this Allhallow's Eve" (F264.12), but Greene changed "Allhallow's Eve" to "All Soul's Night" (C238.34). Whatever damage this does to the Church calendar— Allhallow's Eve is 31 October, All Soul's Night [Eve] is 1 November—the change was appropriate since All Soul's, a feast day instituted late in the tenth century, is a day of solemn supplication for souls in purgatory, a telling image for Henry Scobie's struggle with his tangled loves for Helen, Louise, and God. Other emendations either change one's understanding of a character's action, readjust facts, or sharpen imagery. It makes considerable difference to a reader whether Ali makes "gentle chuckling sounds" (F38.3) or "gentle clucking sounds" (C34.20) as he treats Scobie's injured hand. The revision, much more consistent with "gentle" and "commiseration," avoids the hint of malevolent satisfaction evident in "chuckling" and quite at odds with the characterization of Ali. Often, revision of a single word felicitously refocuses one's sense of character: when Scobie comments, "It's no good confessing if I don't intend to try . . ." (F232.9), he has a definite sense that he must change if the confession is to have any meaning. When Greene changes this to "It's not much good confessing if I don't intend to try . . ." (C211.22), Scobie's outlook has been effectively sentimentalized. He now hopes there is still some slight good in the act of confession whether he intends to reform or not. Usually such tinkering, similar to Conrad's revisions, sharpens imagery with telling effect. Originally when Scobie looked at Louise in the Club, he recognized her vulnerability and perceived "the malice and snobbery of the world padding up like wolves about her" (F27.26). By changing "about" to "around" (C25.12), Greene intensified the image of danger, because he now implies that Louise is surrounded, trapped, and caught in the inevitability of attack. Too, seeing the Portuguese captain as a "hulk of flesh" (C49.5) rather than as a "bulk of flesh" (F54.15) presents him as not only being large and overweight but also as being clumsy and awkward. Sometimes the revision picks up the imagery in the sentence and heightens its metaphorical quality. Such explains the revision of "ran" (F83.24) to "rang" (C81.20) in the clause, "the figures rang their changes . . . like a peal of bells." Scobie's questioning, "If so-and-so . . . then what follows?" (F174.20) becomes an inevitable causal sequence when revised to "If so-and-so . . . then that follows." (C161.13), and Yusef's relationship with Scobie is much more clearly defined when the phrase "My friendship with you" (F162.1) changes to "My friendship for you" (C150.37). The original phrasing suggests a mutual friendship; the revision suggests that Scobie does not return the friendship and is even more isolated from human contact. Whereas some changes merely tighten phrasing—"said softly aloud" (F197.6) revised to "whispered" (C180.12)—others reflect Greene's rethinking of the theological implications of his novel. By changing "when the moment of Grace comes" (F221.28) to "when the moment of Grace returns" (C201.21), he subtly implies that man once enjoyed a state of innocence in Grace, that he has now lost it, and that it may return. "Comes" hints that it will arrive anew and quite unexpectedly. Less significant thematically but quite important emotionally, Greene has substituted "darling" for "dear" each time Helen speaks to Scobie to stress her emotional involvement (F203.14, 205.9, 230.34, 231.9, 281.10, 17, 29, 282.12/C185.32, 187.16, 210.14, 24, 253.10, 17, 28, 254.7). Conversely, Scobie's and Louise's "darlings" become "dear" or simply "you" or disappear altogether to tone down their relationship and to stress their growing estrangement (F192.17, 281.9, 282.24, 283.11/C176.17, 253.9, 254.18, 255.2). Despite many changes, only four sentences in the novel were completely recast—two of Scobie's and two of Wilson's. Wilson's original evaluation of Louise, "She's wonderful" (F64.22), became "She's too good for him" (C58.23), and his last remark in the book, "I'm straight" (F301.33-34), became "You can trust me" (C269.30-31). Both revisions heighten the comparison of the two men with Wilson praising himself indirectly while condemning Scobie. In the other two sentences, Greene fuzzes Scobie's moral perception. Originally Scobie saw his dilemma with the captain's letter clearly: "he resolved to tell no lie. If the letter were suspicious, he would write" (F53.21-22). He decides not to lie and yet not to report the letter if it is entirely innocent. The sentence becomes "he decided that he would write" (C48.21). Later when Scobie blurts out "To me that means—well, it's the worst thing I can do" (C210.36-37) in explaining to Helen why he cannot simply attend Mass, his sense of loss and potential damnation has become indistinct and almost inarticulate compared with his earlier "To me that means—well, damnation. To take my God in mortal sin" (F321.20-21). However less distinct and emphatic the revisions are, they accomplish Greene's intention of making Scobie less attractive because less comprehending and less anguished. Only one of the 23 additions is important. The other 22 are minor additions of conjunctions, prepositions, and articles, though emending "a safe" (F108.19) to "a safe place" (C103.6) and "tell a lie" (F155.1) to "tell a kind of lie" (C144.29) does change the meanings of the sentences. The major addition, though, concerns Greene's decision to reinstate a six-page manuscript chapter (C70-75). Greene explains his rationale in the "Introduction" thus: "In the original draft of the novel a scene was played between Mrs. Scobie and Wilson on their evening walk along the abandoned railway track below Hill Station . . . This put Mrs. Scobie's character in a more favourable light, but the scene had to be represented through the eyes of Wilson. This scene—so I thought when I was preparing the novel for publication—broke Scobie's point of view prematurely; the drive of the narrative appeared to slacken. By eliminating it I thought I had gained intensity and impetus, but I had sacrificed tone" (p. xiii). The chapter tells us much more about the romantic immaturities of Wilson than the moral shortcomings of Scobie, but we see an entirely different Louise. As long as we see her through Scobie's eyes, she remains a mousy, bland object of pity; through Wilson's eyes, she plays Isolde to his Tristran. Here she becomes a perceptive, slightly hardened wife keenly aware of both Scobie's and Wilson's shortcomings. She tells Wilson that the poetry he reads is "too romantic" (C74.16) and that she does not want him (C74.35-75.3). She knows that Scobie will be happier without her (C72.31) and that his "terrible sense of responsibility" (C75.27-28) is not love. The Louise Henry Scobie sees as so vulnerable deftly crushes Wilson's advances with a curt "Oh, for God's sake, Wilson, . . . don't let's have a petting party" (C74.31-32). The additions and changes pale in significance, however, when one considers the 130 deletions, for it is with these that Greene made his major adjustments in the novel's rhetoric as he deleted words, phrases, sentences, and, at times, even short paragraphs. By muting personal relationships, deleting words of sympathy, compassion, and understanding, and excising religious imagery, Greene made Henry Scobie more bruskly abrupt, less aware of the duplicity of his own actions, and far less imbued with a religious perceptiveness. No longer can one draw comparisons between St. Peter's denial of Christ and Scobie's actions, because Greene deleted the sentence, "Away in the town the cocks began to crow for the false dawn" (F175.12-13/C161.37). No longer can one point to Scobie's awareness of the implications of his actions, since sentences such as "I'm a Catholic. I can't have two wives" (F193.31/C177.27) were excised. In refocusing Scobie's character, Greene removed the terms of endearment Scobie used with Louise and Helen. "My dear" either disappears or becomes simply "dear." The effect is quite noticeable when "My dear, I've got bad news" (F213.34) becomes "I've got bad news" (C194.22), and "It won't work, darling" (F281.34) changes to "It won't work" (C254.33), because the tenderness or even the facade of tenderness begins to ebb from Scobie's relationships. Next, Greene deleted Scobie's evasions and defenses, usually indicated in the 1948 text by modifiers such as "evasively" (F19.5/C17.17), "accusingly" (F60.3/C54.7), "angrily" (F61.1/C54.36), "impatiently" (F192.5/C176.5), "apprehensively" (F191.2/C175.18), "wearily" (F192.32/C176.32, F194.7/C177.36), and phrases such as "with pity" (F116.19-20, 230. 32-33/C110.13, 210.13). Scobie now merely smiles (C186.20); he no longer "smiled to hide the danger" (F204.16). Since his love for Helen and Louise, himself, and God becomes murkily confused in his mind, it is scarcely surprising that Greene also increased Scobie's confusion. The 1971 Scobie no longer thinks frequently and lovingly of his God. Scobie's understanding and verbalization of the relationship weaken when sentences such as "he thought, with love, even God is a failure" (F284.6-7), "I love you, but I've never trusted you" (F290.15), and "I love you and I won't go on insulting you at your own altar" (F290.32) lose their expressions of love (C255.34, 261.7, 261.23), no matter how inadequate the original expressions were. Repeatedly, Scobie's verbalization of his guilt and anguish are softened or deleted entirely. Within twenty lines in a crucial scene in the 1948 text, Scobie admitted "I've been such a failure . . . ." (F194.31/C178.23), "I'm sorry about everything" (F195.3/C178.28), and "He envied her the tears" (F195.14/C179.2), and he continually pondered why he ever wrote "more than God" (F196.18-20, 197.1-4, 260.12/C179.34, 180.10, 235.15) in his letter avowing his love for Helen. Greene deleted these as well as Scobie's moment of decision when he sensed "I would never go back there, to the Nissen hut, if it meant that she were happy and I suffered. But if I were happy and she suffered . . . that was what he could not face" (F195.32-196.1/C179.19). He no longer even denies his own goodness (F172.26-29/C159.30), an important point since denial of goodness, if sincere, increases the reader's awareness of his actual though tainted goodness and signals his worthiness here as in The Power and the Glory . No longer does Scobie bargain with God, asking for death "Before I hurt you again" (F281.28/C253.27), and the night of his suicide, Scobie rejects those "imploring fingers" without achieving his important recognition: "He said to those scrabbling desperate fingers, O God, it's better that a millstone. . . I can't give her pain, or the other pain, and I can't go on giving you pain. O God, if you love me as I know you do, help me to leave you. Dear God, forget me. But the weak fingers kept their feeble pressure. He had never known before so clearly the weakness of God" (F296.5-13/C265.15). Because Greene deleted so much religious imagery and so many overt references to moral and theological terms, one may conclude that he indeed wished his revision to be a reply to those who would make him a "Catholic novelist." In the much revised first chapter of Part Three, Book Two, Greene deleted Scobie's reaction to Helen's arguments. He no longer responds "heavily as though he were accepting a penance" (F194.1/C177.31), nor does he later promise "with a sense of despair, as though he were signing away the whole future" (F203.30-31/C186.10), nor does he refer to his sense of corruption as a coating of his stomach which he "can never void" (F259.6-7/C234.14). Even Helen's comments often lose their religious overtones. Greene deleted "You are a Catholic. I wish you weren't, but even if you weren't you hate not keeping your word" (F216.14-16/C196.30) from Helen's letter to Scobie and also dropped the phrase "if you add just one more?" (F232.12/C211.26) from her question "What difference does it make," asked when she and Scobie are discussing sin and confession. Interestingly, one of the most important comments about human love, one accorded Wilson, was also deleted. As Wilson walks away from Scobie's house nursing his nosebleed, he no longer senses a futility in all acts of love: "He looked out over the landscape of baking earth and bleak iron huts towards the Scobies' house as though he were examining the scene of a battle after the defeat. He wondered how all that dreary scene would have appeared had he been victorious, but in human love there is never such a thing as victory: only a few minor tactical successes before the final defeat of death or indifference" (F241.9-16/C219.8). The many other deletions, like the numerous changes, less affect the presentation of character than they tighten phrasing and correct imagery. 9 Most readers probably regret the deletion of such similes as "with the roguery of an old elephant" (F69.33-34/C63.1), which described Father Rank's manner of speaking to Tallit, "like the too mature remark of a child" (F191.21/C175.36), which characterized Helen's reaction to Scobie's work, and "they lifted discretion between them like a cradle" (F203.23-24/C186.4), but when Greene revised "et cetera and et cetera" (F242.31) to "et cetera, et cetera" (C220.19), he avoided an elementary awkwardness, and when he changed "lay uncoiled and ruffled like an angry snake" (F62.15) to "lay ruffled like an angry snake" (C56.2), he certainly sharpened the image—no angry snake would be uncoiled . Deletion of "selfishness" from the phrase "egotism, selfishness, evil" (F128.16/C121.5) and "dissatisfaction" from "melancholy, dissatisfaction, and disappointment" (F15.21/C14.11) avoids redundancy. In the "Introduction" to the novel, Greene stated that "this edition for the first time presents the novel as I first wrote it, apart from minor revisions, perhaps more numerous than in any other novel in the British Collected Edition" (p. xiii). The two halves of the sentence can scarcely be reconciled. In that Greene restored the manuscript chapter, the novel is indeed closer to what he first wrote. But by the time he completed the other revisions, many of them anything but minor as he claims, the novel had become strikingly new. As Greene wished, few readers will be able to respond to the 1971 Scobie as they did to the 1948 Scobie, for the rhetoric surrounding him is quite different.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Towards a New Chronology for the Dramatic Eclogues of Juan Del Encina by Henry W. Sullivan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of a growing modern interest in the varied artistic achievements of the noted poet, playwright and composer of the Spanish Renaissance, Juan del Encina (1468-1529?), the lopsided picture of his evolution and creative growth established by Don Emilio Cotarelo y Mori has remained the standard, largely unchallenged one for nearly half a century. 1 Increased interest in Encina's multiple talents over the last two decades has taken numerous forms: re-editings of his influential drama in sound, inexpensive volumes, 2 editions of his poetry, 3 musical criticism and performance of his music live or on long-playing records, 4 and new monographic studies in English. 5 Cotarelo's picture of Encina's growth, however, might be summed up by comparing his precocious career to a firework display that had all but guttered out by the poet's twenty-eighth birthday. It will be our modest purpose in this article to question and modify the reasoning by which Cotarelo came to this view of Encina's life and work. In 1496, the year of the first publication of Encina's Cancionero at Salamanca, the vast bulk of the poet's writings, it is true, some sixteen thousand lines of lyric verse, a prose Arte de poesía castellana , an idiosyncratic rendering of Virgil's Bucolics , sundry prologues and the first eight eclogues written for the Duke of Alba's court, had already appeared. Since Cotarelo dated most of the dramas that figured for the first time in subsequent reprints of the Cancionero as works produced by Encina prior to 1497 and published later, it would be possible to come to the conclusion with Don Emilio that the Salamancan's talent had indeed deserted him by the time he passed thirty. Obliged by the evidence of his questionable dating procedures to view Encina's career in two discrete halves, Cotarelo could write in 1928: "Juan del Encina compuso todas sus obras conocidas, menos dos, la Trivagia y la Farsa de Plácida y Victoriano , antes de su primer viaje a Italia y apenas cumplidos los treinta años de edad. Y al considerar que su vida alcanzó la cifra casi normal de sesenta y un años, el hecho nos produce el efecto como de un autor malogrado , tanto más cuanto podemos comprender el número y variedad de sus obras y dada su gran facilidad para componer lo mucho que pudo haber producido en los otros treinta años de su existencia" ( Prólogo , p. 28; my emphasis). As recently as 1972, Anthony van Beysterveldt has repeated Cotarelo's perception of the matter as if that critic's informed opinion were actually an objective fact. In a monograph quite masterful in other respects, the Dutch critic unreservedly states: "Todo lo que se ha conservado de su obra literaria fue escrito antes de cumplir el autor los treinta años descontando la Egloga de Plácida y Victoriano y la ya mencionada Trivagia , obra esta última compuesta cuando ya tenía cumplidos los cincuenta años." 6 Neither critic can then repress the impulse to wag an admonishing finger at Encina across time for having wasted his energies in hedonistic revelry instead of sticking to his writing. 7 Such a picture is not only inaccurate and unjust, it is misleading with regard to Encina's steady maturation and psychological integrity as an artist and, worse still, palpably distorts the story of Spanish secular drama's experimental but lusty beginnings. Cotarelo's widely accepted chronology is very far from definitive and the steps of reasoning employed to sustain it are on occasion so complicated that Cotarelo's virtuosity may easily baffle the reader into silently consenting to positive distortions. To modify this picture, it will be necessary to recapitulate the interesting evidence suggested by J. Caso González for a revised chronology of the early eclogues I-VIII, 8 and advance original arguments building on Crawford's and Kohler's work to revise the order of eclogues IX-XIV forward in time. 9 We also plan to include the controversial Egloga interlocutoria in this series and round out our revision with some closing remarks on Encina's later poetry. This patient sifting of evidence and minutiae will necessarily be set against the background of Encina's professional and intellectual growth and peripatetic shifts of domicile; consequently, problems of dating, bibliography, and biography will assume a dimension of prime importance. From the synthesis of these results, a very different Juan del Encina emerges both as man and artist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Sequence of Eclogues I-VIII The first eight eclogues appeared together in the princeps edition of Encina's Cancionero published under the poet's own supervision at Salamanca in 1496, though they do not follow the sequence of the festivals in the Christian calendar which they celebrate (that is, Christmas, nos. I-II; Easter, nos. III-IV; Carnival and Lent, nos. V-VI). The four pairs of plays also form complementary units as to dramatic sense since the second playlet always acts as a sequel to the first. Taking the traditional date of 1492 for Encina's dramatic beginnings, Cotarelo situated the Christmas eclogues I and II on Christmas Eve, 1492, the Easter pair III and IV in Holy Week of the following Spring, 1493, the Carnival eclogues V and VI in Shrovetide of the next year 1494. Erroneously supposing that Eclogues VII and VIII also celebrated Christmas (there is no mention of anything to do with Christmas in either!), Cotarelo assigned VII to Christmas of 1494 and VIII, said numerous times in the text iself to take place exactly a year later, to Christmas of 1495. The Cancionero left the press on June 20, 1496, according to its colophon. Now this chronology takes two very important things for granted: (1) that 1492 was the date of Encina's first plays, and (2) the sequence in the printed Cancionero is the actual sequence of composition. The traditional date of 1492 for Encina's dramatic début has no documentary basis in fact and derives from the well-known passage in Agustín de Rojas' loa on the origins of the Spanish theater in his Viaje entretenido of 1603. Commenting on the year of the fall of Granada, Rojas wrote: ................................................ y entonces se daba en ella principio a la Inquisición, se le dio a nuestro comedia. Juan de la Encina el primero, aquel insigne poeta, que tanto bien empezó, ................................................ en los días que Colón descubrió la gran riqueza de Indias y Nuevo Mundo, y el Gran Capitán empieza a sujetar aquel reino de Nápoles y su tierra, a descubrirse empezó el uso de la comedia. . . . 10 Now while the Moorish capitulation and Columbus' landfall in America both took place in 1492, the Inquisition had been established already by 1478 and the campaigns of Gonzalo de Córdoba ("el Gran Capitán") against the French in the kingdom of Naples did not begin till after the death of Ferdinand I of Naples in 1494. Kohler, writing on the rather blurry historicism of Rojas and the unreliability of the date 1492 for Encina's début, accurately observed: "Offenbar hat Rojas, wenn er von dem ersten berühmten spanischen Dichter, Juan de la Ençina spricht, der in den Tagen des Columbus und Ferdinands des Katholischen lebt, nicht ein bestimmtes Jahr im Auge, sondern will nur eine Epoche allgemein charakterisieren" ( Sieben Eklogen , p. 20). Menéndez y Pelayo actually took this arbitrary date to "fix" the entry of Encina into Alba's household. He writes: "La más antigua de estas composiciones escénicas, que es una égloga de noche de Navidad representada en 1492, nos permite fijar la fecha en que Juan del Encina entró como familiar en el castillo de Alba de Tormes." 11 This "fact" has been mechanically repeated ever since. As to our second reservation, J. Caso González has adduced convincing historical evidence to suggest that the eight eclogues were actually written within a year of each other and in the sequence of the festivals of the Christian calendar, not in the order printed. Basing his argument primarily on the references in Carnival eclogue V to imminent war with France, Caso González fixed the year of the piece as 1496. Beneyto grieves in the play over the departure of the Duke of Alba ". . . antes mucho de mes muerto, / y que al marzo ha de partir" ( Eglogas completas , V, ll. 39-40). Beneyto is later overjoyed to hear that a cessation of hostilities has been declared (ll. 197-205). Against the suggestion of Crawford and others that the pact referred to in Encina's text was the peaceful transfer of Roussillon and Sardinia to Ferdinand by Charles VIII of France on September 10, 1493, Caso suggests that Encina referred to troop movements under way in the spring of 1496. At that time, Ferdinand the Catholic was engaged in campaigns in the kingdom of Naples, as we have seen above. Towards the end of 1495 and especially in the early months of the following year, Ferdinand built up a diversionary campaign against his adversary attacking France from the frontiers of Roussillon. He instructed the various military Orders and certain grandees of Spain to muster in the war zone by June. Alba may have been among them, but decided to leave somewhat earlier in March (as Bras' words in lines 39-40 would seem to indicate). Charles, however, beleaguered on two fronts, opened convincing overtures of peace at about this time and the Castilians felt confident enough to begin demobilization procedures. Though the French king later proved treacherous, it would have appeared highly probable at Carnival time in 1496 that the risk of open war near Spanish soil had palpably diminished. A closer examination of dates for the year 1496 bears out the plausibility of Caso's contentions. In the year 1496, Easter Sunday fell on April 3 and Carnival was celebrated the customary forty-odd days earlier in mid-February. 12 Precisely speaking, Shrove Tuesday of the leap year 1496 was February 16 and Ash Wednesday, marking the beginning of Lent, fell on February 17. Prior to the Tuesday night of the performance of V, then, it is common knowledge that the Duke of Alba has been summoned to appear in Roussillon by June, but plans to leave earlier, ". . . y que al marzo ha de partir." Early word arrives of a truce and the alarm of the Alba household passes. Commenting on the raids into France of the commander Enrique Enriquez de Guzmán in 1496, the historian Prescott confirms: "The French, who had concentrated a considerable force in the south, retaliated by similar inroads, in one of which they succeeded in surprising the fortified town of Salsas. The works, however, were in so dilapidated a state, that the place was scarcely tenable, and it was abandoned on the approach of the Spanish army. A truce soon followed , which put an end to further operations in that quarter " (my emphasis). 13 Caso fixed the dates of the two Christmas eclogues by a reference ( Eglogas completas , I, ll. 28-31) to the fear in which Alba was supposedly held by France and Portugal. The latter fact, connected with the demise of João II of Portugal on October 25, 1495, and the military support provided by Alba to his successor Prince Don Manuel, suggested the date of I and II, therefore, as December 24, 1495. In the prose preface to the First Eclogue, there also occurs an important reference to the Cancionero of 1496: ". . . prometió que venido el mayo, sacaría la copilación de todas sus obras porque se las usurpavan y corrompían" ( Eglogas completas , p. 69). The "following May" would be only a month short of the precise date on the Cancionero's colophon of June 20. If, as seems unlikely, 1492 were the true year for Eclogue I's composition, then the promised deadline would have been missed by a highly improbable three and a half years. In the Eighth Eclogue, Encina speaking in the guise of Mingo actually does present the promised Cancionero to the Duke and Duchess of Alba. Since Eclogue VIII was necessarily written before it went to press, the presentation scene here must refer to the gift of Encina's collected plays, poems, prologues and so on, written out in fair copy and ready for the printer, not to the handing over of the Cancionero as such. The poems are referred to by Mingo thus: "que trayo para les dar, / agora, por cabo de año, / el esquilmo del rebaño / quanto pude arrebañar" (ll. 53-56). The image of sheep-shearing in late Spring and the reference previously to "este verano" (l. 40) harmonize perfectly with the period May-June under discussion, and the phrase "por cabo de año" (preposterously construed by Cotarelo as a reference to Christmastime) can be viewed, with Caso, as a reference to the end of Encina's first year of service at Alba's court. 14 No critical authority has questioned the relationship, proclaimed numerous times in the text, of Eclogue VIII to Eclogue VII. The latter was performed one year earlier than the former. Hence, if VIII dates from late Spring of 1496, VII must have been written in late Spring of 1495. By process of elimination, the two Holy Week eclogues, III and IV, must fall within the single, twelve-month span during which I-VIII came into being, that is Easter of 1496. In that year Good Friday fell on April 1 and Easter Sunday (the possible day of the performances of both plays) on April 3. Adding these specifics to Caso's proposed new chronology, the following composite picture emerges: (1) Eclogue VII ( en reqüesta de unos amores ), late Spring—early Summer of 1495, (2) the Christmas eclogues I and II, December 24, 1495, (3) the Carnival eclogues V and VI, Shrove Tuesday, February 16, 1496, (4) the Holy Week eclogues III and IV, April 1 and 3, 1496, and (5) Eclogue VIII, a year later than VII, late Spring—early Summer of 1496, but necessarily prior to June 20. Before leaving the issue of Eclogues I-VIII, certain new implications raised by these chronological revisions must be examined. Foremost among these is the obvious gap created in Encina's biography. Where would he have been between roughly 1490, the date his studies at Salamanca terminated at around age twenty-two, and the summer of 1495? Moreover in whose service was he during this period? To fill this gap, José Luis Varela has adduced fascinating new evidence concerning Encina's possible activity as a corregidor and circuit judge in Aguayo (Santander) early in 1495. 15 According to a document in the Simancas archives, one Juan del Enzina was designated by the Catholic Kings to recruit troops for the war brewing with France and had discovered his agent, Alonso de San Pedro, to be guilty of bribery and fraud in receiving pay-offs from men of military age wishing to avoid the draft. The document bears the date March 23, 1495. Since Encina's patron, the Chancellor of Salamanca University Don Gutierre Alvarez de Toledo, was related to the royal family, and since Encina (described in a papal bull of 1500 as "vir dominus Johannes del Enzina clericus Salmantinus Bachelarius in legibus ") had studied law, 16 there is nothing intrinsically improbable in his having worked for Ferdinand and Isabella in a legal capacity early in 1495. A second important consideration revolves around Encina's activity as a musician and composer. According to Mons. Higinio Anglès, Encina's music was composed for Alba's court in the 1490's and transmitted to the royal repertoires in Castile via the regular interchange of minstrels and musicians. 17 Now if in the early 1490's Encina was actually in the service of the Catholic Monarchs, his musical settings may have passed in the other direction, that is from the royal chapels to the Duke's scribes who collected the Cancionero musical de palacio largely from scores in the court of Alba de Tormes. 18 Certain of Encina's sixty-two extant compositions may also have been penned after his appointment as resident dramatist in 1495. In a third consideration, evidence suggests Encina was in the service of the Catholic Kings since before the capitulation of Granada on January 2, 1492. In the prologue to his paraphrase of Virgil's Bucolics addressed to Ferdinand and Isabella, Encina claims that no one can adequately express the greatness of their deeds. Then he adds: "¿Quanto más yo, que aun agora soy nueuo en las armas e muy flaco para nauegar por el gran mar de vuestras alabanças?" 19 The use of armas here could, of course, be merely a trope in such an encomiastic context. The recital of campaign victories on this page and the specific reference to Granada two lines further down, however, heighten the possibilities for its literalness. Did he then serve in the Granada campaign in some capacity? In his Trivagia (1521) Encina compares the sparse and level landscape of Jericho to the Vale of Granada in language suggesting he had visited the Moorish stronghold. He comments: "Que propio semeja, si buen viso tengo, / la vega en España, que vi de Granada." 20 Finally, in one of Encina's finest villancicos , the opening refrain runs: "Levanta Pascual levanta / aballemos a Granada / que se suena ques tomada." 21 Was this poem written at the time and place of the events which its evergreen air of topicality suggests? Marshaling these conjectures in chronological order, Encina's early career might have evolved thus: graduation in law and minor orders from Salamanca in 1490-91; part of the retinue of the Catholic Kings at the fall of Granada, January 2, 1492; a period of artistic activity, chiefly musical, at the royal court, 1492-94; a period as circuit judge for the same monarchs, spring, 1495; entry into the Alba household and promotion to master of ceremonies and resident dramatist in early summer, 1495.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Encina's Professional Troubles. Eclogue IX and the Egloga interlocutoria No doubt whatever exists concerning the date of Encina's so-called Egloga de las grandes lluvias , assigned by López-Morales the number IX. The nickname was conferred on it by the nineteenth-century German hispanist, J. N. Böhl von Faber, and refers to the storms that hit western Castile in the Christmas season of 1498. Encina himself records the fact in a passage where the shepherd Juan talks of ". . . el año noventa y ocho, / entrando en noventa y nueve" (ll. 83-84). In those days, Spaniards still reckoned the New Year from December 25 onward. This eclogue makes the first mention of a crucial incident in Encina's career: the bitter battle for the cantorship of the Cathedral of Salamanca, a vacancy created by the death of Encina's old music teacher, Fernando de Torrijos, late in 1498. In the middle of this Christmas eclogue there occurs a twenty-five line digression on Encina's musical career and his ambitions for the post. In December he still aspired to succeed Torrijos but feared the post would not fall to himself since the appointment was by election and the majority of votes were against him. Encina's main rival for the cantorship was his fellow Salamancan, Lucas Fernández, a man of similar talents. Both he and his uncle, Alonso González de Cantalapiedra, are obliquely referred to in the First Eclogue. Lucas Fernández could count on the support of his uncle, who held the influential post of Archpriest of Alba, as well as on one Francisco de Salamanca, another member of the chapter. Encina enjoyed the backing of the Archdeacon of Camases, Bernadino López de Logroño, who on October 24, 1498, had formulated an opinion urging Encina's candidacy should no external candidate be found to take charge of the contested vacancy. In view of this split vote, the chapter compromised by nominating a committee which, in 1499, gave the position not to one person but to three, one of whom was Lucas Fernández. Incensed at the outcome of the matter, Encina decided to quit the Salamanca region and left for Rome, probably later in 1499, to plot his revenge. 22 Now further light is shed on this incident in the disputed Egloga interlocutoria , to which we have conveniently assigned the arabic numeral 11. This eclogue was first recorded by Salvá in his Catálogo , where he stated that it was bound with four other eclogues of Encina, though unfortunately he did not mention which. 23 Salvá was convinced that the work came from the pen of Encina; and Urban Cronan, who published the text in 1916, also supposed him to be the author. 24 Ralph E. House, writing in the same year, supported Cronan's contention and Cotarelo accepted the Encinian paternity of the eclogue in 1928. 25 S. Griswold Morley rejected these findings in 1925, however, on metrical grounds. He closed his prosodic analysis with the words: "Observe that Encina never used quintillas , nor changed meters within one piece. The strophic evidence points, then, to another authorship." 26 López-Morales does not consider Encina the author ( Eglogas completas , p. 46) and O. T. Myers did not include the work in his study of Encina's language. 27 Despite the current climate of opinion, it is difficult to imagine anyone other than Encina as the play's author. The rubric of the prose preface strongly resembles the wording and style of Encina's other prologues, though in this case its preface does contain inaccuracies of plot summary. The shepherd names Gil, Benito and Pascuala had already been used before; only Pascual (representing the author) is new. We find the Duke and Duchess of Alba sitting in their hall as in previous eclogues and they are the subject of a long eulogy at the end. We also find similarities of phrasing and language with earlier plays. Ralph E. House, commenting on these various parallels, concluded: "The structure of the play, its inclusion of heterogeneous themes, and the development of each theme are identical with Encina's earlier style. Reference has . . . been made to the structural similarity of the first part with Eglogas I and II. In its entirety it may be compared also to Egloga IX. This play shows likewise a distinct tripartite division. The first part is made up largely of references to the personal affairs of Juan, the second is the game of pares y nones , while the concluding scenes treat of the birth of Christ. These are substantially the themes of Egloga IX taken in reverse order." 28 As far as Morley's arguments go concerning the atypical strophic practices in the play, these seem insufficient to us to warrant denying Encina's paternity. Since Encina used a considerable variety of octosyllabic arrangements, including some five-line patterns, there is nothing intrinsically extraordinary in his employing quintillas in most of the Egloga interlocutoria . As far as arte mayor is concerned, Encina employed it throughout the Egloga de los tres pastores in three different rhyme-schemes. As regards changes of meter within one play, contrary to the impression created by Morley, they occur frequently in Plácida y Victoriano . Finally, to deny Encina the paternity of the work in question because he attempted something new in the matter of strophic form seems an extraordinary slap in the face to the very initiator of Spanish drama itself. Certainly it does not appear to us a strong enough argument on its own to outweigh the heavy balance of evidence that favors Encina's authorship. The most important consequences of ascribing 11 to Encina concern his biography and the problem of dating. It is really a deposition in dramatic form that deals another blow in the wrangle over the Salamanca cantorship. Pascual clearly stands for Encina and Benito is Lucas Fernández. Pascual's harsh words to Benito in the opening lines and the references to his uncle (ll. 33-40) leave little doubt about the matter. Pascual's remarks may also furnish us with material on which to base a date for the play's composition. Since the shepherd expressly states that it is "now in the summer" and the winter season is still several months away, this might suggest that Christmas was the pretext for writing the work rather than the occasion. Now since the Fernández affair blew up in the Fall of 1498 and the Salamanca chapter decided to divided the controversial post three ways on January 11, 1499, giving Encina's rival one third, it seems reasonable to suppose that Encina composed the play in the summer of 1499. He would still be seething from the humiliation of his abortive candidacy, hoping desperately for Alba to make more supportive gestures toward him and tempted already perhaps by the prospect of greener pastures in Italy. Kohler, in his discussion of the play's possible date ( Sieben Eklogen , p. 34), noted that Encina probably abandoned Spain shortly after 1498. Further evidence of the polemical nature of this eclogue is furnished by the title, for which no critic has offered any explanation. The term 'interlocutory' is a legal one and still in use in modern times. In law one may still refer to an interlocutory decree, for example. An obvious reflection of Encina's student training as an attorney, the term denotes rulings in cases still in contention which are not definitive, merely intermediate or temporary. The meaning of the title becomes clear if Encina did not regard the cantorship battle as having been definitively decided. And indeed the matter was not settled, since in 1502 Encina succeeded in getting himself nominated to the self-same post through the papal intervention of Alexander VI. This eclogue, then, should be viewed as a dramaticolegal maneuver, an 'interlocutory' statement pending a final ruling. Though Francisco de Madrid had used his primitive Egloga around 1495 to attack the political ambitions of Charles VIII of France, it took the irrepressible Encina to angle the eclogue format to further his own political ends. According to Georges Cirot, there might be a curious postscript to Encina's Salamancan career. He noted in 1941: 'Il n'est pas hors de propos de rappeler ici ce que le duc de Berwick y Alba faisait connaître dans son discours de réception à l'Academia de la Historia: de juin 1498 à juillet 1500, Encina fut pensionné par le duc d'Albe (3,000 maravedis) pour étudier à Salamanque; donc après que ses huit premières pièces ( églogas ou representaciones ) eurent été présentées et même publiées (1496)." 29 What Encina could have wished to study at Salamanca at age thirty is a difficult question to answer. If the plan to seek his fortune in Italy had been brewing in his mind for some time, then he might have undertaken the study of Italian. Some elements in the maturer plays suggest he had a more than common knowledge of Greek. In XII, all three shepherds have names of Greek origin. Fileno's derives from philo , to love, Cardonio's from cardios , the heart, and Zambardo's probably from zampoña (&lt;Gk. symphonia ). In XI, Febea probably derives from phoebe and the old procuress, Eritea, in XIV must get her name from the Greek eritheia meaning 'working for hire.' Encina could well have felt the desire to acquire either or both of these languages before making his move. Whatever the truth of the matter, Encina clearly did not avail himself of the stipend up to July of 1500, since he had established himself in Rome by at least the spring of that year and had most probably arrived in the course of the previous year 1499. We must presume a certain interval of time which even the astute social climber Juan del Encina would have needed to ingratiate himself so fully with the reigning Spanish pope.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Encina's Remove to Italy: Eclogues X and XI-XIV The play nicknamed El triunfo del Amor by Bartolomé José Gallardo and assigned the number X by López-Morales offers no problems as to dating. The 1507 Salamanca printing of Encina's Cancionero contains this eclogue and two separate editions have survived: one at the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid, another at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. But the real date of the play is clear from its context and original title: Representacion ante el muy esclarecido y muy ilustre principe don Juan, nuestro soberano señor . Prince Don Juan, who we must suppose presided at its performance, was married in Burgos on April 2, 1497, to Margarita of Austria, the daughter of Emperor Maximilian. By October 4 of the same year, in Salamanca, the Prince had gone to a tragically early grave. It seems logical that, at the suggestion of the Duke of Alba, Encina composed the work as a festivity to entertain the royal newly-weds. Now the date of this play, 1497, proves crucial in the chronology of Cotarelo which we are attempting to discredit and will be dealt with in due course. Meanwhile it provides the basis for a second point of disagreement. Cotarelo always contended that Encina only saw the princeps edition of his Cancionero (1496) through the press and that all subsequent editions (1501, 1505, 1507, 1509, 1516) were done during Encina's absence in Rome. Dismissing for bibliographical and chronological purposes the validity of any subsequent re-editing, he writes: ". . . no tiene valor ninguno, porque ENCINA estaba fuera de España y no intervino en ninguna de las impresiones de su compilación, que los editores enriquecieron a su gusto" ( Prólogo , p. 25). This is far from certain, however. When Encina's Cancionero was reprinted at Seville in 1501 and at Burgos in 1505, it contained no new additions with respect to dramatic content. But the 1507 Cancionero , printed in Encina's native Salamanca, contained two new additions: IX, the Egloga de las grandes lluvias , and X, El triunfo del Amor . We can only speculate as to how these works were introduced into the 1507 edition, as Encina was indeed in Rome at the time. They date, as we have seen, from 1498 and 1497 respectively. Encina may conceivably have conveyed the manuscripts to one of his brothers (Pedro de Hermosilla perhaps?), since his family frequently acted on his behalf in legal and other business matters. And it is a very different matter with the 1509 edition, also published at Salamanca. Encina had suceeded in winning the favors of Pope Alexander VI shortly after his arrival in Rome late in 1499 or in 1500. Encina's fortunes grew still further under Alexander's successor, Julius II. Probably towards the end of 1508, Pope Julius conferred on Encina the dignity of the archdeaconry of Málaga in southern Spain. Encina ensured that nothing would go wrong with this appointment by obtaining signatures from King Ferdinand himself and an authorization for the papal bull from Don Diego Ramírez de Villaescusa, Bishop of Málaga (1500-1508). Encina's brother, Pedro de Hermosilla, acted as his attorney and presented the documents to the chapter at Málaga on April 11, 1509. Encina could have arrived in person at any time after this date. He signed his first extant capitular act on January 2 of the following year, 1510. There is, therefore, no valid reason to suppose that Encina was not in Spain in the summer of 1509. The colophon of the 1509 Cancionero reads as follows: "Fue esta presente obra empri-/mida por Hans gysser aleman / de Silgenstat en la muy noble / &amp; leal cibdad de Salamanca: la / qual dicha obra se acabo a. vij. / del mes d'agosto del año de mil / &amp; quinientos &amp; nueve años." Between the act of possession by proxy on April 11 and the date of the new edition, August 7, 1509, almost four full months were available to Encina to travel to his native city, consult with Hans Gysser the printer, and leave him the two new eclogues for inclusion in the Cancionero : XI, the Egloga de los tres pastores , and XIII, the Aucto del repelón . He would then have traveled south to take up his post in Málaga as archdeacon. Given that the plausible scenario suggested above is the true one, we must conclude that Encina brought the two new plays with him from Italy and that he almost certainly composed them there. Cotarelo opined differently, insisting that both had been composed in Spain before the year 1497. It is to this difficult and controversial problem that we must now turn. Writing in 1894, 30 and repeating his argument in 1928 to refute Crawford's specific findings concerning the indebtedness of Encina's Egloga de los tres pastores to the Second Eclogue of Antonio Tebaldeo (1463-1537), Cotarelo asserted that a play of Lucas Fernández provided a terminus ad quem of 1497 for most of Encina's undated plays. From Fernández's Farsa o cuasi comedia del soldado published at Salamanca in 1514, Cotarelo adduces the following passage as an overt reference to Pelayo, the hero of Encina's Triunfo del Amor , struck down by an arrow from the bow of Cupid: También me ñembra Pelayo, aquel qu'el amor hyrió , que en aquel suelo quedó tendido con gran desmayo. 31 (Cotarelo's emphasis). Elsewhere in the same play, Cotarelo emphasizes lines 392-393: " éste cuido en la montaña / ogaño a un pastor hirió ." This second reference to Pelayo and the word ogaño (that is, "this year") would fix the date of the Farsa of Fernández and Encina's Triunfo del Amor as one and the same: 1497. Thus, argues Cotarelo, the other overt references to Encinian characters in Fernández's Christmas drama (Gil in Encina's Eclogues VII and VIII, Fileno in XII, Cristino in XI) fix the dates of all Encinian dramas where those characters appear as prior to Christmas of 1497. This ingenious but circular reasoning bases the interrelationship of Encina's works and their dates upon citations from a second author, which require the known date of an Encina play as the starting-point of the argument in the first place. Moreover, all stands or falls by the literal interpretation of the word ogaño to mean 1497. Answering Don Emilio, Kohler ( Sieben Eklogen , 45-46n., 58-61) observed that ogaño might be a rhetorical flourish at best. He also suggested a later date of 1509 for Fernández's Farsa ; one or both of these arguments would suffice to dismantle Cotarelo's shaky scaffold of reasoning. The peril, however, lay in refusing to recognize that Encina almost certainly composed Eclogues XI-XIV after leaving for Rome and that: (1) these dramas belong to a later phase of Encina's creative career, and (2) they all show signs of Italian influence. Against Crawford's manifest textual proof that Encina had successfully plagiarized Tebaldeo in his Egloga de los tres pastores , for example, Cotarelo was forced to argue that it was Tebaldeo who had plagiarized Encina! As Crawford himself later wrote: "Leaving out of the question, for the time being, the internal evidence to determine whether Tebaldeo's eclogue or Encina's play is earlier, how is it possible to believe that Tebaldeo, residing at Bologna or Mantua, should hear of this unpublished play of Encina (which first was printed in 1509), should make a version of it in which every diffuse element should be rigorously excluded and Encina's play of 704 lines should be cut down to 151 lines; and that the Italian version should be printed in the fall of 1498, at least two years before Encina made his first visit to Italy?" 32 Apart from the commonsense arguments of Crawford and the probability, described by us above, that Encina brought the Tres pastores and the Aucto del repelón with him from Italy to Salamanca in summer, 1509, a long eulogy of Oriana in the Tres pastores by Cardonio (ll. 394-412) would seem to be a reminiscence of Montalvo's Amadís , the earliest known edition of which appeared at Zaragoza in 1508. As to the Aucto del repelón , its strange non-standard Spanish and modified Sayagués might point to a style aimed at wider reader comprehension by a mixed Italian-Spanish audience. Such a hypothesis might explain the continual dropping of prosthetic e before the initial group st , certain cases of the retention of initial f , and some vocabulary. It remains to add a word on the dates of XI, the Egloga de Cristino y Febea , and XIV, the Farsa de Plácida y Victoriano . The only extant copy of the former work, preserved in Santander, bears no date or place of publication. Barbieri suggested it might have issued from a press in Salamanca some time after 1509. Eduardo Juliá Martínez has surmised of Cristino y Febea that it reflects a moment of spiritual crisis in the life of the author. 33 The play deals with the sudden and ill-advised intention of a cultured young hedonist to abandon the world and devote himself to the religious life in all its ascetic rigor. He is defeated in this design by Cupid and the beauty of the nymph Febea. Though Encina did commit himself to the cloth in 1519 by taking holy orders, he had ample reason to consider doing so already in 1511. On July 14, 1511, Encina was virtually ousted from the archdeaconry of Málaga by his chapter, discontented at his repeated absences and his lowly status in minor orders as deacon. They decreed that he could only participate and vote in meetings or receive his full stipend if he were to be ordained in sacris . Thus Encina was on the brink of an ultimatum: commit himself unequivocally to the cloth and the vows of celibacy, poverty and obedience, or lose his status in the Church hierarchy. His torment at this dilemma finds a clear expression in Cristino's vacillations and the play would date, then, from some period in the months around or after July, 1511. Plácida y Victoriano was performed in Rome on January 6, 1513, as attested by a letter of Stazio Gadio. L. F. Moratín stated that there was a Roman edition of the work in 1514. Since Encina left his controversial post in Málaga for a second sojourn in Rome some time after May 7, 1512, the composition of Plácida y Victoriano would have occupied him during the latter months of 1512 in Rome, before the New Year period when the play was being rehearsed for performance. Its long and elaborate nature suggests the work was in the gestation stage for a considerable time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Encina's Later Poems When Encina was finally ordained at Rome in spring, 1519, he resolved on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land with the intention of celebrating his first mass there. He has left an account of this journey in his Trivagia o viage a Jerusalem , published after his return in 1521. The poem is composed in two hundred and thirteen coplas de arte mayor and evidently conceived as a major undertaking inviting comparison with the Trescientas of Encina's poetic idol, Juan de Mena. The devout travelogue was a great success and reprinted many times (1521, 1580, 1606, 1608, 1733, 1786). Encina's ambitious poem has, however, received scant attention from critics and the zealously Catholic Menéndez y Pelayo has doubtless done much to deter a proper reading by his scathing remarks about the poem's lack of true religious inspiration. This is a pity, because set beside Cotarelo's picture of Encina, the autor malogrado , Plácida and the Trivagia seem to hang in space like mere appendages, not as parts of a continuously evolving artistic consciousness. Moreover, the poem tells us the following news of yet another edition of the Cancionero , which unfortunately never left the presses: .................... Y porque ya el Pueblo de mí nuevas haya, Viage, sus, anda, tú sé Precursor Del advenimiento de aquella labor, De todas mis obras, que ya están á raya. Labor, que es en Lacio nacida, y en Roma; Por dá cuenta á todos, y á gloria de Dios Que tome vocablos de las lenguas dos, Latin y Romance de su patria toma. . . . 34 It would appear, then, that by 1521 Encina had already begun a new compilation of his works in the region of Rome ("en Lacio nacida") and planned to bring them out shortly ("ya están á raya"). No such Cancionero has survived but we can only surmise that any unpublished works of Encina written in Rome since 1509 were destined to be included. It is certainly regrettable that this final testimony to Encina's later activity, edited with his customary care and thoroughness, is consequently unavailable for scrutiny. The late R. O. Jones has drawn attention to a MS in the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid (no. 17510 of the Gayangos collection), in which we find the Trivagia and a summary in romance of the whole voyage. These were published along with a prose narrative account of the voyage by Enríquez de Rivera, Marquess of Tarifa, in whose company Encina had traveled. In the MS version, there are also a number of villancicos connected with the trip to Jerusalem and a long poem in twenty-eight stanzas of décimas (rhymed ABAAB:CDDCC): Coplas sobre el año de quinientos y veynte y uno de Juan del Encina . The latter describes the droughts, famines, and popular disorders that plagued Seville from 1520 and reached their height in 1521. Some historical corroboration of these events survives in Diego Ortiz de Zúñiga's Annales eclesiásticos y seculares de la muy noble , y muy leal Ciudad de Seville . . . (Madrid: Imprenta Real, 1677). He writes: "Pero no permitiò establecerse bien la tranquilidad de la Ciudad, la terrible carestia, que en ella, y su comarca se padecía, y falta de pan, valiendo una fanega de trigo setecientos marauedis, gran suma para aquel tiempo, con que hambrienta, y necessitada la plebe, por auer tardado granos que se esperavan de fuera del Reyno, a ocho del mes de Mayo , segun algunas memorias, que otras lo refieren mas adelante, se amotinò. . . ." (p. 477; my emphasis). Since Encina's account has an eye-witness quality to it, we must assume that he was present in Spain by the summer of 1521. He had been appointed by Pope Leo X to the priorship of the Cathedral of León as early as 1519. One Antonio de Obregón, acting as attorney, took possession of the prior's post in Encina's name on March 14, 1519. The earliest extant evidence of Encina's presence in León are certain capitular acts that he witnessed on November 20, 1523.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Conclusion The poem of 1521, written almost certainly after May of that year, the publishing of the Trivagia in Rome also in 1521, and the ongoing project for a new edition of his complete works all show that Encina, only six or seven years before his death in 1529, was far from written out. By his own admission on folio ii of his 1496 Cancionero , Encina began writing at age fourteen. He tells of "obras . . . hechas por Juã del enzina desde q̃ huvo catorze años hasta los veynte y cinco primeramente." Since on the best evidence Encina was born on July 12, 1468, his poetic activity began therefore in 1482-83 and extended to at least 1521-22, a period of some forty years. Contrary to the impression created by Cotarelo, this activity was continuous, not violently truncated after the age of thirty. Encina wrote drama steadily after 1496 and miraculously improved his own prototypes. Throughout the 1520's it doubtless remained his intention to leave a complete edition of his works, but old age, palsy and death claimed him first. If all our suggested revisions to the chronology of the Encinian canon proved correct, then, the accompanying table would more accurately portray the writer's career than does Cotarelo's standard account of 1928. We would be forced to assign works such as Fernández's Farsa del soldado a date after 1511, suggesting that Encina was a pioneer in the 1490's, as tradition insists, rather than one of a numerous Castilian "school" (Lucas Fernández, Gil Vicente, Torres Naharro, Garci Sánchez de Badajoz, etc.). We would see him as a man who followed his artistic star resolutely, learning from the Italians and attempting dramas on an ever larger scale. He did not become a mindless orgiast after 1500, but studied avidly, tending the flowers that he himself had planted. Title of Play or Poem No. of López Mor.

Comparative Chronology of Encina's Works</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Cotarelo's admirable contributions to Encina scholarship began in 1894 with an article entitled "Juan del Encina y los orígenes del teatro español," later reprinted in his Estudios literarios de España (Madrid, 1901), 103-181. He expanded much of this material in the Prologue (hereafter Prólogo ) to his Cancionero de Juan del Encina . Primera edición 1496. Publicado en facsímile por la Real Academia Española (Madrid, 1928). All references to the non-dramatic works of Encina are hereafter designated by the folio numbers of this Cancionero . 2 The edition of Manuel Cañete and F. A. Asenjo y Barbieri, Teatro completo de Juan del Encina (Madrid: Real Academia Española, 1893) exists in a modern reprint (New York: Greenwood, 1969). The edition of Humberto López-Morales, Eglogas de Juan del Enzina (New York: Las Américas, 1963) was reprinted with extensive prologues added as Eglogas completas de Juan del Enzina (New York: Las Américas, 1968). All references to the dramatic works of Encina are hereafter designated Eglogas completas and denote the latter edition. 3 Neither the collection of Angel J. Battistessa, Canciones de Juan del Encina (Buenos Aires: Colección Fábula y Canto, 1941) nor that of J. Givanel Mas, Juan del Encina : Poemas (Barcelona, 1940) is complete. A new edition of the Poesías completas , ed. R. O. Jones and H. López-Morales (London: Tamesis Books) is in press at the time of writing. 4 See Gustave Reese, Music in the Renaissance (New York: Norton, 1954), esp. chapter XI, 575-586, and Robert M. Stevenson, Spanish Music in the Age of Columbus (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1960), 253-272. The Collegium Musicum performed some of Encina's music live at Lexington, Kentucky, on the occasion of the Foreign Language Conference, 4.26.1974, and the Ars Antiqua of Paris performed some Encina at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 3.29.1975. His music is also represented in "Agrupación coral de Pamplona de España," Columbia Records; "Canciones españolas," Deutsche Grammaphon Gesellschaft; "Music of the Spanish Renaissance," Turnabout Records; "Secular Vocal Music of the Renaissance from Spain, Italy and France," Dover Records; "Seraphim Guide to Renaissance Music," Seraphim Records; "Spanish Music of the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella," EMS Records; "Spanish Song of the Renaissance," Angel Records; and "Spanish Vocal Music from the Time of Charles V," Musical Heritage Society. 5 Expressive of a renewed interest in Encina in the United States are full-length studies such as Richard J. Andrews, Juan del Encina : Prometheus in Search of Prestige (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1959); Oliver T. Myers, "Phonology, Morphology and Vocabulary in the Language of Juan del Encina," Diss., Columbia University, 1961; James A. Anderson, Encina and Virgil , Romance Monographs Series (Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1974). See also my forthcoming Juan del Encina (New York: Twayne). 6 See Anthony van Beysterveldt, La poesía amatoria del siglo XV y el teatro profano de Juan del Encina (Madrid: Insula, 1972), p. 23. 7 Van Beysterveldt continues (p. 23): "Parece legítima la suposición de que Encina, al dejar reposar su pluma a lo largo de estos veinte años, ha bebido, sin hastiarse, en la copa de la vida cuyas delicias, quizás, en aquel tiempo no eran para ser descritas." This supposition is, in fact, a sheer guess and really quite unfair. 8 See J. Caso González, "Cronología de las primeras obras de Juan del Encina," Archivum (Oviedo), 3 (1953), 362-372. The Roman numerals refer to the numbers assigned to Encina's eclogues by H. López-Morales. Yet another new view of these first eight eclogues is offered in an interesting and sensibly argued article, Juan Carlos Temprano, "Cronología de las ocho primeras églogas de Juan del Encina," Hispanic Review , 43, no. 2 (1975), 141-151. Temprano's argument hinges on an ad quem of 1493 for Eclogue VIII. This he establishes by adding the twenty-five years mentioned by Encina above his table of contents in 1496 to the widely accepted birthdate of 1468. The article does not really deal with Caso's major points, however, and the author admits: "El problema que naturalmente surge de esta afirmación es el explicar cómo as posible que pasasen cerca de dos años y medio entre la composición de la última obra y la aparición del Cancionero " (p. 145). 9 See J. P. Wickersham Crawford, The Spanish Pastoral Drama (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1915); "The Source of Juan del Encina's 'Egloga de Fileno y Zambardo'," Revue Hispanique , 38 (1916), 217-231; "Encina's 'Egloga de Fileno, Zambardo y Cardonio' and Antonio Tebaldeo's Second Eclogue," Hispanic Review , 2 (1934), 327-333; and The Spanish Drama Before Lope de Vega (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1937).

Prescott, History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella (London, 1842), vol. II, p. 306. 14 In the Cancionero , folio lii, there is a poem in twenty stanzas of arte mayor entitled: Juan del enzina despues que el duque y duquesa sus señores le recibieron por suyo . The poem expresses abject gratitude for Encina's new employment and stresses strongly that he feels rescued from a spell of ill fortune. Might he have lost his position at the royal court after events arising out of the bribery scandals in Aguayo in the spring of 1495? This poem might be from the same period as Eclogue VII. 15 See José Luis Varela, "Juan del Encina, juez," in Festschrift für Fritz Schalk , ed. H. Baader and E.

Barbieri y Asenjo (Madrid: Real Academia de las Bellas Artes de San Fernando). 19 Cancionero , folio xxxi. 20 Quoted from Menéndez y Pelayo, Antología , VII, p. xxii. 21 Cancionero , folio xcvii. 22 In his edition of the Cancionero musical de Palacio , Barbieri supposed that the long poem he assigned the number 382 (pp. 196-197) expressed Encina's prior intention of going to Estremoz in nearby Portugal. The angry, disillusioned "shepherd" there is also called Juan. 23 See the Catálogo de la biblioteca de Salvá , 2 vols. (Valencia, 1872), I, p. 434. 24 See Urban Cronan, "Egloga interlocutoria," Revue Hispanique , 36 (1916), 475-488. 25 See Ralph E. House, "A Study of Encina and the 'Egloga interlocutoria'," Romanic Review Quarterly , 7 (1916), 458-469. 26 See S. Griswold Morley, "Strophes in the Spanish Drama before Lope de Vega," in Homenaje ofrecido a Menéndez Pidal (Madrid: Hernando, 1925), vol. I, p. 508. 27 See O. T. Myers, "Phonology, Morphology, . . ." (see n. 5). 28 House, "A Study of Encina . . ." p. 464. 29 Cited by Cirot in "A propos d'Encina. Coup d'oeil sur notre vieux drame religieux," Bulletin Hispanique , 43, no. 2 (1941), 123-153, at p. 132, n. 4. 30 Cotarelo's essay, published in 1894 and 1901, was rewritten on this point to accommodate the new findings of Crawford published in 1915 and 1916. Crawford's article of 1934 is a reply to Cotarelo's Prologue. See notes 1 and 9 above. 31 See Alfredo Hermenegildo, ed., Teatro selecto clásico de Lucas Fernández (Madrid: Escelicer, 1972), p. 160, ll. 171-174. 32 "Encina's 'Egloga de Fileno, Zambardo y Cardonio' and Antonio Tebaldeo's Second Eclogue," Hispanic Review , 2 (1934), 327-333, pp. 331-332. Crawford erroneously gives the date of the first printing of the Egloga de los tres pastores as 1507 in his text. I have taken the liberty of correcting this to 1509 to avoid further confusion. 33 He offers this judgment in his essay "Literatura dramática peninsular en el siglo XV," in Historia general de las literaturas hispánicas , publicada bajo la dirección de G. Díaz-Plaja (Barcelona: Barna, 1956), vol. II, 265. 34 Quoted from the last complete edition of Encina's poem, Viage y peregrinación a Jerusalem (Madrid: Pantaleón, 1786), p. 5.</field>
