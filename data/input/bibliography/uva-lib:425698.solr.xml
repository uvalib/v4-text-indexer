      <field name="heading_text">Publishers and Sinners: The Augustan View by Ian Watt *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One fairly widespread feature of Augustan literature is the idea that the temple of the Muses was being profaned by sinful and arrogant booksellers and that the true wit, therefore, should miss no opportunity of cutting them down to size. Hostility to publishers is not, of course, peculiar to the eighteenth century, but it does seem uniquely powerful and pervasive in the literature of the period from Dryden to Goldsmith; their iniquities seem to meet us everywhere, not only in verse and prose satire, but in fiction and drama, to say nothing of private letters and parliamentary debates. It's usually only a matter of incidental jeers, but there is also something of a special literary tradition in which the bookseller figures as comic villain; in poetry, of course, there's the Dunciad , with Lintot and Curll given leading roles and a dozen or so other booksellers in the cast; there are prose pamphlets like Richard Savage's (and probably in part Pope's) An Author to be Let (1729), plays like Fielding's The Author's Farce (1730) and Samuel Foote's The Author (1757), Archibald Campbell's Lucianic dialogue The Sale of Authors (1767), and a host of novels including, most notably, Amelia and Roderick Random . The period is also characterized by the amount of personal friction between authors and booksellers: David Hume brandishing his sword at Jacob Robinson, Dr. Johnson knocking Thomas Osborne down, Goldsmith trying to do the same to Evans, and Pope, determined to make the punishment fit the crime, choosing the emetic as his weapon and applying it to the bowels of that gross feeder at the table of the Muses, Edmund Curll. Why do the booksellers loom so large on the literary scene? Was their bad eminence peculiar to England? What literary consequences did it have? And to what extent was the hostility which the booksellers provoked—in Pope, for instance—justified? I must preface my necessarily cursory and speculative attempt to indicate answers to these inherently difficult problems with a note of scholarly caution. We must remember that despite the many additions to our picture of the institutional structure of the Augustan literary world since the two main monographs on the subject, Alexandre Beljame's Le Public et les Hommes de Lettres en Angleterre au Dix-huitième Siècle (1881), and A. S. Collins' Authorship in the Days of Johnson (1927), the limits to our knowledge are still numerous and in some respects crippling; nor can much be done about them until the short-title catalogue finally wings its way into the eighteenth century, and until we are then supplied with an Augustan equivalent to Paul Morrison's Index of Printers, Publishers and Booksellers (1955).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I When, in the early seventeenth century, leadership in all the activities connected with the printing press passed from Germany and Italy to France and the Netherlands, England was still very far behind. It produced very little paper, for instance, and all its type was imported or of foreign design. In the next hundred years, however, the picture changed dramatically: in 1686 the many efforts to manufacture good white paper for printing had succeeded sufficiently for the White Paper Makers to be incorporated, and by 1713 two-thirds of the country's requirements were being produced at home; as for type, Caslon set up his foundry in 1720, and from then onwards his ideas, and later Baskerville's, turned England into an exporter of type and a leader in typographical design. 1 We find very similar contrasts when we turn from methods of production to types of publication. In the early seventeenth century, for example, Holland and then France led in the field of the newspaper, but the world's first daily, the Daily Courant , came out in England in 1702. The foundation of the Journal des Savants in 1665 exemplifies France's earlier prominence in another kind of periodical, the learned review; but the foundation of the Tatler and Spectator shows the England of Queen Anne initiating quite a new periodical genre which became very popular abroad; and Cave's Gentlemen's Magazine , founded in 1731, was equally novel and influential. Among the many other signs of England's increasing prominence two other important innovations in the world of letters may be cited: in England the effective development of the circulating library began in 1740, whereas the spread of the cabinet de lecture in France came later, in about 1763; and there is a similar twenty-year priority in the matter of encyclopaedias—that of Diderot published between 1751 and 1776 followed the example set in England by the printer Ephraim Chambers in 1728. I make these contrasts only to underline the fact that the appearance of the Dunciad in 1728 coincides with England's very recently achieved leadership in a great number of publishing activities, activities which set the pattern for future developments both there and elsewhere. The main causes of these developments, I suppose, are the same as those which had brought about England's commercial expansion in general; but one of them seems to be of special importance: the ending of Stuart absolutism, with all its traditional and restrictive social and economic attitudes, by the Glorious and Protestant Revolution of 1688, with its encouragement of free individual enterprise in every field. The importance of this changed commercial and ideological background can be estimated either by looking at how the Stuarts had earlier attempted in innumerable ways to control and restrict the development of printing and bookselling, or at how in France authors, printers, and publishers alike remained subject to every kind of harassment at the hands of autocratic and clerical power until the French Revolution. In the eighteenth century, then, the English book trade in general flourished as never before; it remains to inquire why it was the booksellers rather than the printers who held the dominating position; and, first of all, therefore, to inquire what the division of functions actually was. For, in the present context, the term "bookseller" is itself very confusing; there was no real eighteenth-century equivalent to our booksellers today, men exclusively devoted to the retailing of books; and on the other hand the convenient practice of equating the "bookseller" of the eighteenth century with the "publisher" of today is also misleading, since at that time no one was exclusively engaged in the publishing business either. There are really five main roles in the business of getting a book into the purchaser's hands: first, of course, the writing of it; second, the transfer of the manuscript to the printer; third, the printing itself (in which category I include, as the eighteenth century did not, folding, tying and binding the printed sheets); fourth, the storage and distribution of the finished product; and fifth, the retailing of it to the buyer in a shop or through some other channel. Today, we usually think of the publisher as one who undertakes or controls the middle three of these operations: getting the copy from the author, arranging for the printing, and lastly, storing the book and sending it out to the retail booksellers. From the Elizabethan period until quite late in the nineteenth century, however, almost any permutation or combination of any of the five functions was possible, although the increasingly common practice in the eighteenth century was for the booksellers to perform not only the three functions we now expect of a publisher, but also the final one, that of selling the book to the public. The 1757 edition of Campbell's The London Tradesman makes the position reasonably clear: the bookseller's function is "to purchase original copies from authors, to employ printers to print them, and publish and sell them on their own account, or at auctions, and sell them at an advanced price: but," the writer adds, significantly, "their chief riches and profit is in the property of valuable copies." It is the "property of valuable copies" which occasioned not only the many legal battles of the booksellers in the eighteenth century, but also most of the public attacks against them; and it is this control of copies which I shall have primarily in mind when I refer, as I normally shall, to booksellers or publishers without distinction as far as the eighteenth century is concerned. I should perhaps add that contemporary usage of the term "publisher" was itself confusing: normally, as in Swift and Pope, it refers to whoever is responsible for making a book available to the public, under whatever conditions, but later a more technical sense also appears, confined to the wholesaling, and perhaps the retailing, of the finished book, and specifically excluding responsibility either for printing or for ownership of the copy. The division of labor in the book trade in the eighteenth century, then, had not yet crystallized into its present form, although we must remember that it has not done so universally even today, especially in backward areas: University Presses, for example, often both print and act as publishers. Compared with the earliest days of printing, however, when Caxton had personally written the text, set it up, printed it, and sold it, the division of labor had gone fairly far by the time of Pope; in fact it is not a gross oversimplification to say that the big London booksellers, the Tonsons, the Lintots, Andrew Millar and Robert Dodsley, carried on their business very much as publishers do today, except that they also happened to run bookstores. In the general history of the book trade the crucial separation was that between printer and bookseller, usually said to have begun with Anthony Koberger as early as the end of the fifteenth century. By the end of the sixteenth century the English printers were already loudly complaining that they could hardly make a living because the booksellers, through their complete control of the retail market, were able to dictate their own terms and had forced printing prices down very severely. The main reason for the economic advantage of the bookseller, I suppose, is that by its nature printing requires both a large initial capital outlay, for the press, type and so on, and a considerable regular volume of business to meet costs and wages. Bookselling, on the other hand, needs no staff, and very little in the way of premises or equipment; while in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at least, it was very easy to acquire a stock. John Dunton, one of the Dunces attacked by Swift and Pope, describes in his Life and Errors how, in 1681, he merely "took up with half a shop [and] a warehouse," published one religious work, Thomas Doolittle's The Sufferings of Christ , and then, "exchanging it through the whole trade" of booksellers "furnished my shop with all sorts of books saleable at that time." It was easy, then, to become a bookseller. To trade with any security, however, also involved being a member of the Stationers' Company and this normally required a good deal of capital: the commonest way of becoming free of the Company was by serving a seven-year apprenticeship, and the average premium charged by master printers, for example, during the eighteenth century was about twenty pounds, a very considerable sum in those days. But that was the only hurdle, at least after 1695 when the Licensing Act of 1662 had lapsed, and with it the restrictive powers both of the Stationers' Company and of the "Surveyor of the Imprimery and Printing Presses," a post created by the 1662 Act and long filled by the notorious Sir Roger L'Estrange. The end of licensing had even more important indirect implications for the development of bookselling, since it terminated the many government efforts to hold the number of printers down to the theoretical legal limit of twenty which had been set by the Tudors and reaffirmed by a Star Chamber decree of 1627. By 1724 there were seventy-five printers active in London, and by 1785 the number had risen to 124. Nor does this alone fully indicate the scale of the increase after 1695: the number of presses in an individual printing office, which had previously been limited to two in most cases, was now free to go up, sometimes to as many as nine; and even more important, perhaps, printing in the provinces, which had been forbidden by a Star Chamber decree of 1586, spread rapidly—in 1724 there were already at least twenty-eight provincial printers at work. The development of the provincial market no doubt helped to foster the spread of the reading habit on which the prosperity of eighteenth-century booksellers was partly based; and so did the increase in newspapers which was much stimulated by the ending of effective censorship. Whatever the reasons, there is no doubt that, compared either with their former condition or with that of their French counterparts, the booksellers of the Augustan period were extremely well off. The bookseller Thomas Guy, helped it is true by a variety of speculative enterprises, was the most eminent charitable endower of the time—Guy's Hospital is but one of many benefactions; Jacob Tonson paid over twenty thousand pounds for his country estate, Hazel; and a generation later both Andrew Millar and William Strahan left fortunes of nearly a hundred thousand pounds. They and a good many others, booksellers such as the elder Thomas Osborne, Awnsham Churchill and Bernard Lintot, printer-publishers such as Samuel Buckley, John Barber and Samuel Richardson, were as wealthy as all but the biggest London merchants and financiers. The improved social and economic status of the paper, printing, and bookselling trades in general is further suggested by the fact that the Stationers' Company, which had produced no Lord Mayor of London during its first hundred years, produced no less than five of them during the eighteenth century. 2 The solid prosperity of the bookselling trade in particular is attested by the fact that several publishing houses were founded which continue today—Charles Rivington set up shop, for example, in 1711, Thomas Longman in 1724, and John Murray in 1768; while John Brindley, in 1728, started a bookshop in New Bond Street which still survives, under the name of Ellis's. The contrast with the position in France is striking. The greatest of the booksellers there, Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, made only a very modest fortune—"une honnête aisance"—and that right at the end of the eighteenth century. Until then the chief authorities 3 agree that the very dark picture of French eighteenth-century bookselling painted by Diderot in his Lettre sur le Commerce de la Librairie (1767) is in the main justified. It is true that Paris had always had many more booksellers than London, some 235 in 1600 apparently, a figure which was certainly not equalled in London until the end of the eighteenth century; and also that in the early decades of the seventeenth century publishing flourished, with Scarron earning as much as a thousand livres—some fifty pounds, perhaps—for one book of his Virgile travesti , and with the bookseller Claude Barbin occupying a privileged position among literary men somewhat like Tonson's in England half a century later. But from the time of Louis XIV onward printers, publishers and authors alike were increasingly subject to a crippling interference and persecution from church, state and nobility: most of the great French writers of the eighteenth century knew imprisonment or exile, and many of their works—perhaps the majority—were published abroad, banned, or only issued posthumously. As for the booksellers, they were, for example, forbidden to set up shop anywhere except in two of the quarters of Paris, so that the police could keep their eye on them more easily; further, they needed official approval before any book could be published; and even so the royal imprimatur was always liable to be suddenly revoked—as happened in the famous battle between Diderot and the Jesuits over the Encyclopédie .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II For many reasons, then, French booksellers were neither so free nor so prosperous as their English counterparts in the eighteenth century; and this had many important literary consequences. Most important of all, perhaps, is the fact that in France patronage remained the chief way for writers to earn a living, and this prevented the degree of what one may call the democratization of literature which, for good or evil, occurred in England: both materially and spiritually the home of the French eighteenth-century writer remained the court and the aristocratic salon, whereas in England it was fast becoming the coffee house and the bookseller's backroom—Tom Davies', for example, where Boswell met Johnson. The eventual literary effect of the changed economic and social orientation of the author in England has a close bearing on our answer to the question of whether the widespread hostility of Augustan writers to the booksellers, a hostility which has no genuine parallel in France, was really justified. The mere fact that in England the booksellers were much more prominent and prosperous than they had been before or were elsewhere, would no doubt be enough to explain most of the attacks against them in Pope's time: since it was a new situation in the world of letters it was bound to excite envy. In any case, as far as the Augustan writers were concerned the increasing power and prestige of the booksellers was a particularly striking example of the current changes in the class structure which threatened the hierarchical social tradition which had their ideological allegiance. Quite apart from these historical considerations it also must be remembered that the very nature of the relationship between publisher and author in general tends to breed animosity, like that between landlord and tenant. The letters of Dryden to his publisher, Jacob Tonson, for instance, reveal how rich in possibilities of friction is the situation where the writer is wholly dependent on a man whose ultimate concern is only to get the right kind of copy at the right time for the agreed price, and how this friction is exacerbated by the fact that the writer typically comes to what is essentially an economic transaction with a not wholly material view of his role. So in the end history remembers, not that Dryden got more from Tonson than any poet had got from a bookseller before, but only that Dryden blamed Tonson's meanness for the cursory nature of the annotation to his Virgil; that he sent him a messenger with the ominous triplet: With leering looks, bull-faced and freckled fair, With two left legs, and Judas colour'd hair And frowzy pores that taint the ambient air. And that he accompanied it with the verbal message—"Tell the dog that he who wrote these can write more." It is a pity that he didn't, but of course Tonson wouldn't have paid him for them, and a Dunciad is only possible to a poet who, like Pope, is well beyond the reach of immediate financial necessity. But by an irony he must have relished, Pope himself was only in this fortunate position as a result of the very considerable increase in the scale of payments to authors from the days of Dryden onwards. It was Tonson, apparently, who was mainly responsible for the change: he lured Dryden away from his earlier publisher, Herringman, by offering twenty pounds for his version of Troilus and Cressida , in 1679; for the Fables we have the contract between them for the payment of 250 guineas for 10,000 lines—a shilling a couplet; and according to Pope, Dryden made 1200 pounds for the Virgil . Less than a generation later, however, Pope was able to play Tonson off against his aspiring rivals, notably Bernard Lintot, to much greater effect, so that, partly through the sale of subscription copies given him free, and partly through Lintot's payment of 200 pounds for the copy of each of the six volumes, Pope probably cleared about five thousand pounds for the Iliad , and not much less for the Odyssey . To attempt some assessment of this in terms of income level, it might be fair to say that, since interest rates of 5 and 6 per cent were common, the two works alone could have given Pope an income of 500 pounds a year; an income which was more than that of some of the lesser bishoprics, which was over twice the average income Gregory King assigned to "lesser merchants," and which fell short of Johnson's estimate of "splendour" only by a hundred pounds. Pope, of course, was exceptional, but there are many other indications of the very high prices paid to authors, especially later in the century; sums of a thousand pounds or more for a substantial work, were not uncommon—for Mrs. Carter's Epictetus for example or Fielding's Amelia . Indeed there is perhaps no other period where so many of the acknowledged masterpieces received such immediate and handsome monetary reward—one thinks of 700 pounds for Tom Jones , of over 1000 pounds for The Sentimental Journey , of 6000 pounds for the Decline and Fall , of 500 pounds for the first edition alone of The Wealth of Nations . Johnson's Lives of the Poets , it is true, brought Johnson only 300 guineas, but that was more than the 200 he had asked, and Malone thought that if he had gone as high as 1000 or even 1500 guineas the booksellers would have accepted: similarly, the mere 200 pounds which Swift received for Gulliver's Travels was the figure he had named. One of the two main exceptions to this tendency for increasingly high scales of literary payment by booksellers does a good deal to explain Pope's generally unfavorable attitude: poetry rarely commanded a high price, except for collected editions after the author had made his name. The reason for this relatively low scale of payments for poetry is probably that the booksellers tended to value copy mainly by the two criteria of the known demand for the subject and the probable size, and therefore price, of the book. Any work in several quarto volumes which was either a survey of some important field of knowledge or was of such established literary status that it could be regarded as indispensable to a gentleman's library, constituted a likely investment; and for this reason large works by indifferent writers often received huge rewards—John Hawkesworth, for instance, made 6000 pounds in 1773 for his three-volume Account of Cook's voyages. The usual payment for poetry, on the other hand, was very small: a poem that was less than book length, as most are, averaged from five to twenty pounds: Johnson received ten pounds for London , Pope seven for The Rape of the Lock , and fifteen for the Essay on Criticism ; on longer poems the highest rates of payment seem to have been the 200 pounds which Pope received for a one-year copyright on the Essay on Man , and the 220 guineas which Young received for his very lengthy Night Thoughts . Insofar as the market price of payment influenced what the author wrote, the system, then, discouraged poetry and favored whatever literary genres enabled the author to fill the most sheets the most quickly. This conclusion was in fact drawn by many writers, including Goldsmith. Typically he began with poetry, but having received only twenty guineas for The Traveller , and perhaps not much more for The Deserted Village , despite its five editions in three months, he came to the conclusion that "by pursuing plain prose I can make shift to eat, drink and wear good clothes." The fact is that Griffin, Goldsmith's publisher, could hardly expect to make a great deal out of The Deserted Village at only two shillings a copy. The relative brevity of poetry, combined with the longer time it takes to write, would in general seem to make it peculiarly unsuited to payment by the sheet, and peculiarly suited to a system of patronage, if only because many patrons may be presumed to be even more chary of their time than of their money. The other main exception to the tendency for high scales of literary remuneration occurred when a work proved unexpectedly successful; Robinson Crusoe , for example, is said to have brought Defoe very little, but to have laid the basis of William Taylor's publishing fortune. The reason for this exception is that although the booksellers may in the main have deserved Johnson's praise as generous, liberal-minded men, they still tended to treat literature just like any other market commodity; there had not yet come into being the modern royalty system whereby, jointly though no doubt unequally, author and publisher combine to do as well as possible out of the public. Not that all transactions in the eighteenth century consisted of the outright sale of the copy by the author to the publisher for a lump sum: booksellers occasionally made further payments if a second edition was called for, either ex gratia , as Millar gave Fielding another hundred pounds for Tom Jones , or by contract—such was Tonson's agreement to "pay Mr. Congreve . . . the sum of twenty guineas whenever his volume of poems—which I am now printing—shall come to be reprinted." There were various other approximations to the royalty system: an author might receive a stated proportion of the profits, as Gibbon got two-thirds on those of the third edition of The Decline and Fall , and Johnson a similar share of the proceeds from the publication of The Idler in book form; and there were also many kinds of subscription arrangements, very characteristic of the early decades of the century. The author might, in exchange for the copyright, receive so many volumes to sell for his own benefit, or else he might have the whole edition printed at his own expense, get his friends to sell as many as possible, and turn the rest over to the booksellers: in either case the cost of producing the book was defrayed, at least in part by the subscribers before it was printed. But the commonest arrangement for authors was still that of the outright sale of their copy, and so the writer who had neither capital nor reputation might earn only a pittance which was spent long before the book was published; while for the successful writer the system meant that, in the absence of any continuing regular income from royalties, a Johnson or a Goldsmith would spend most of his literary energies on various kinds of casual labor—proposals, dedications, introductions, epilogues, compilations, translations, and so forth. The negotiating position of the writer with the bookseller was somewhat strengthened by the 1710 "Act for the Encouragement of Learning" which for the first time, apparently, stated that literary compositions in manuscript were the property of their author. Personally I find it difficult to follow some writers who have seen this as the Magna Carta of authorship; but I suppose that some modest jubilation is in order whenever the law is discovered to agree with the expectations of uninstructed reason. Another provision of the Act, limiting copyright to fourteen years and making it renewable only to the author, was probably an indirect step toward the establishment of a royalty system: Pope, for example, sued Henry Lintot on the grounds of this clause, and having thus resumed his rights in The Dunciad , he was able to issue the new and enlarged version in 1743—fourteen years after the old. The 1710 Act, however, was not primarily concerned with the rights of authors; it was, as Pope said, "a bookseller's bill" to make it easier for the trade to take action against piratical printers and publishers; and the need arose partly because of the lapse of the old Licensing Act, and partly because of the intensified competition for copy which came with the increase in the number of booksellers. It is this competition, of course, which is symbolized in the second book of The Dunciad where, parodying the traditional games of epic, the Goddess Dulness makes the booksellers run races and perform other, should one say—feats of skill?—with authors—imaginary or real—as prizes. Pope makes Curll run away with all the trophies—"Still happy impudence obtains the prize"—because he was the most famous of the pirates, and had indeed boldly laid both Swift and Pope under contribution: he wrung from Swift the tribute that "one thorough bookselling rogue is better qualified to vex an author, than all his contemporary scribblers in critic or satire." Curll was only the most prominent of a minority of booksellers who, lacking the capital to attract established authors or to purchase valuable copyrights, employed hacks to turn out various kinds of ephemeral writing which are obvious examples of the literary debasement which ensued from unrestricted competition between publishers for the attention of the public. One of the most conspicuous of these new genres, the one most favored by Curll, and the one most objectionable to Pope, was the scandalous contemporary memoir, biography or secret history, especially that which took the form of the unauthorized publication of private letters. The tremendous vogue of these piracies, and the extent to which they penetrated public awareness, is suggested by a letter from one J.W. (probably Dr. John Woodward) to John Dunton in 1718, which ends: "You'll hear no more from me. . . . There's no writing to a man that prints everything." 4 Dunton, incidentally, well illustrates the influence of the more directly commercial context of literature which was coming to the fore. One day, when walking through St. George's Fields with some bookseller friends, he stopped and exclaimed: "Well, Sirs, I have a thought I will not exchange for fifty guineas." The thought materialized as a weekly question and answer paper called The Athenian Mercury ; and the inanity of some of its contents is representative of the kind of thing Pope was attacking in The Dunciad . One question indeed—"Why a horse with a round fundament emits a square excrement?"—typifies the deluge of scatological and pornographic writing called forth by the itching palms of the less reputable booksellers; Pope's revolting depiction of Curll's fall in Corinna's pool, and of his later submingent prowesses, are a fair satiric comment on this aspect of the literary gutter. (The whole subject, incidentally, of the cloacal image in Augustan polemic cries aloud for the attentions of some curious and intrepid scholar.) A less gamey dullness, however, was much more typical of the commercial kind of writing described by Pope as "daily books and daily bread"; things like Samuel Wesley's "Pindarick Ode on Three Skipps of a Louse," or the endless pamphlet wars on religious, political and literary controversies. To keep these going, it was often alleged, booksellers forced their hacks to write against their own convictions: Fielding, in The Author's Farce , makes his Curll-like—and significantly named—publisher, Bookweight, explain to one of his garret writers that to argue on "the wrong side" of a question is "the properest way to show [his] genius"; and Archibald Campbell develops the theme in his The Sale of Authors . This particular kind of institutionalized subornation and hypocrisy is, of course, the basis of modern journalism, where it goes under the name of conformity to editorial policy: and it is but one of the many examples of how most of the features in the commercial exploitation of the writer today were already beginning to appear in the eighteenth century. It is true that it was the marginal writers and publishers who were then mainly involved; and one could perhaps dismiss Pope's alarm by saying that The Dunciad deals with extreme and trivial cases which only represent, in Chesterfield's phrase, "the licentiousness which is the alloy of liberty." But Pope also introduces some of the big booksellers—Tonson, Lintot, Osborne—into The Dunciad , and thus implies that the booksellers in general bore some responsibility for the spreading empire of Dulness. At the beginning, for example, he couples the booksellers with the theatrical managers as progenitors of the works of Dulness from: . . . the Chaos dark and deep Where nameless somethings in their causes sleep, 'Till genial Jacob, or a warm third-day Call forth each mass, a poem or a play. Actually, it could be argued, genial Jacob Tonson had, in Pope's own case, called forth into print the young poet's first works, and this because, as he flatteringly wrote to Pope, he had seen "a pastoral of yours in Mr. Walsh's and Mr. Congreve's hands, which is extremely fine, and is generally approved of by the best judges in poetry." Here, as in most of his publishing, Tonson was certainly reflecting the best educated taste of his time, and much the same can be claimed, some-what less convincingly, for most of the other well-established booksellers of the time. In any case the main income of the big booksellers like Tonson, Lintot, Longman, Millar, Dodsley, and of the wealthy printer-publishers like Buckley, Tooke, Barber, Richardson, Strahan, came either from copyrights in works of authors now dead (Tonson, for example, claimed an exclusive right to publish Shakespeare and Milton), or from various other monopolies—government printing contracts, or patents giving exclusive rights to publish special kinds of material, educational, legal or religious, for which there was a continual demand. Their primary interest, therefore, was to defend the prices and the copyrights of these valuable properties, and they were not mainly dependent on current writing. To Horace Walpole's charge in 1764 that "our booksellers here at London disgrace literature by the trash they bespeak to be written, and at the same time prevent every-thing else from being sold," they could fairly answer that he naturally tended to reflect the hostility of their envious rivals, the printers, and further that the main things which they in fact bespoke were large and valuable projects like Johnson's Dictionary or Hume's History , works which could not have been produced otherwise. James Ralph—another Dunce, incidentally—pictured in his The Case of Authors by Profession or Trade Stated (1758) how "the sagacious bookseller feels the pulse of the times, and according to the stroke, prescribes not to cure, but flatter the disease"; he gave as his example the novel, and it is no doubt true that fiction, from the time of the seventeenth-century publisher "Novel Bentley" until the days of the mass production of fiction in the late eighteenth century by the Noble brothers and the Minerva Press, was much stimulated by booksellers without noticeable regard for literary value. But here again the main booksellers could claim that though of course they catered to all comers, the dominant tendency of their editorial policy was nevertheless to reflect the solid and traditional tastes of the educated reading public, if only because they were the main purchasers of the substantial volumes on which they made their largest profits. Even so I believe that Pope and the other alarmists were in a sense right: something like Sainte Beuve's "Littérature Industrielle" (1839) was coming into being. In Pope's day it was mainly confined to Grub-Street, but as the century wore on the implications of the new context of literature became more evident. The mere fact that even the greatest authors increasingly had their eye on the reading public as a whole, rather than on their patrons or on their peers in taste and knowledge, must have had incalculable effects on the style and content of what they wrote: not all of these effects, one imagines, were bad, and yet they were almost certainly bad for the kind of matter and manner we find in Pope, for example: much of his perfection of form and compressed intransigence of statement must have been lost on what Shenstone called "the mob in reading." Certainly, any commercial pressure towards haste in composition is particularly disastrous for poetry; as Oldham put it in his imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry , though not, perhaps, without inviting an invidious reflection: But verse alone does of no mean admit; Who'er will please, must please us to the height; He must a Cowley or a Flecknoe be, For there's no second-rate in poetry. On the other hand the new situation was uniquely favorable to the very antithesis of poetry, journalism, which provides the readiest means for printers, publishers and writers alike to engage the attention of the largest number of readers. Goldsmith made the logic of this tendency explicit when he wrote in 1761 that "the effort . . . to please the multitude, since they may be properly considered as the dispensers of rewards," made writers concentrate on bringing "science down to their capacities." "This," he continued, "may account for the number of letters, reviews, magazines, and criticising newspapers, that periodically come from the press." As time went on journalism, by Gresham's law, started to drive out much of the older literary currency; this at least was what Crabbe suggested in his "The Newspaper" (1785), a poem which he considered to be "the only one written on the subject": For these [newspapers] unread the noblest volumes lie; For these, in sheets unsoiled the Muses die; Unbought, unblessed . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III If the more directly commercial context of literature, unintentionally perhaps, but inexorably, favored the most ephemeral literary forms over poetry, traditionally and actually the most perennial, it had equally disastrous results, as the Augustans saw it, on those responsible for the maintenance of the literary tradition. The "Grubean race," as Swift called them, were the result of the same specialization as had led to the rise of the bookseller: and like them they responded to the dictates of economic individualism. People of every class were now flocking to London as never before, in an attempt to find fame and fortune in the profession; but, as many economists, from Petty to Adam Smith, pointed out, all the established professions were vastly overstocked—even teaching. Once in London, the possibility of living by one's pen beckoned, and it had the unique advantage that no special training was required. So Grub-Street pullulated with hackney authors: its miseries were real enough, but they were the result, not so much of the malice or parsimony of the booksellers as of the economic law that a labor surplus brings down wages; the social historian, indeed, may see the legend of Grub-Street primarily as an early and revealingly hostile social definition of a new professional class. Certainly there is evidence that the writers themselves were feeling the need to establish a less unflattering public identity, for the expression "author by profession" began to gain currency in the fifties, when it was used by Ralph, Murphy and others. It is interesting, incidentally, to note that there was an analogous and almost contemporary movement in France, by which the term "homme de lettres" came to apply only to writers and not to the literati , the men of taste in general; and in 1764 Jean-Jacques Garnier wrote his monograph on L'Homme de Lettres . The emergence of the new social group is an important part of the subject of the Dunciad : fitly, for the epic traditionally deals with the birth of a new nation. And if at first its two successive heroes seem incongruous, and we feel like objecting that after all Theobald was not foolish and Cibber was not dull, the context of the new literary professionalism may help us to discover a real kinship between them: both were unauthorized professional intruders into the republic of letters—Theobald, not only an attorney by trade but, like Bentley before him, a pedantic scholar who wouldn't stay where he belonged, and who had the impudence to know better than a man of wit, and even to receive 652 pounds 10 shillings for his edition of Shakespeare; and Cibber, a vagabond player, now presuming from his success on the stage and from the growing social recognition given to the actor's trade that he was entitled to write a book telling the world about his life and opinions. The dates of the Dunciad , from 1728 to 1743, mark an important transitional era in the history of the profession of writing. Under Queen Anne enlightened political patronage had bestowed wealth and power on the greatest writers of the time, on Prior and Addison and Swift; while the most successful of the booksellers, Jacob Tonson, by maintaining close ties with the literary and political leaders of the time, and by publishing only what was consistent with the educated tastes of his circle, had achieved a unique combination of the tradition of literary patronage and the new power of the bookseller. With the advent of the Hanoverians, Tonson's retirement in 1719, and the dissolution of the Kit-Cat Club soon after, there came a decisive change. Bernard Lintot's list 5 had none of the discrimination that is evident in the elder Tonson's; while the outstanding feature of the thirties in respect to patronage was Sir Robert Walpole's massive purchase of journalistic support without any regard to literary merit. William Arnall, for example, is said to have received more for his polemical writings in four years than did Pope for his Homer ; he is, of course, remembered in the Dunciad , which belongs to this last era of patronage, that which took a flagrantly political form, and which was succeeded by the era which saw the final triumph of the booksellers and the professional authors. It was not easy for Pope to define his position in the new situation which the development of bookselling was creating. He could hardly identify himself with the emergent class of professional writers, and yet the same new social and economic conditions as had produced them were fast making literary patronage obsolete. In any case his religion, his politics, his temperament, and above all, perhaps, the pattern of the new individualism, would have made it very difficult for him to adapt himself to the accommodating role that would be expected of him by a patron, if one had been available. In the event, however, he managed, somewhat like Tonson, to make the best of both worlds. Adopting intact from the old literary order Boileau's role of the poet as the legislator of Parnassus, he removed himself far enough above the common throng to be able to voice "la haine d'un sot livre" with the full sacerdotal commitment. At the same time, however, he was able to assert his independence from patronage through the new resources which the booksellers had made available. Boileau, of course, had loftily refused payment for his works from his bookseller, as did Blackmore, and as Gray and Cowper were to do; but Pope set out to beat venal booksellers and hacks alike at their own game. By an extraordinary example of the interpenetration of opposites, which Professor Sherburn's edition of the letters now enables us to trace in fuller detail, Pope turned his aristocratic friends, not into patrons, but into publishers—he set Lady Burlington, the Earls of Orrery, Islay and Granville, and the Viscount Simon Harcourt to soliciting subscriptions, dispatching and storing books, keeping accounts and collecting money, and he also made the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Burlington and Lord Bathurst proprietors of the copyright of The Dunciad . Not content with this, Pope set himself up as a kind of unofficial literary agent, for Swift and others; he inspired the starting of a newspaper, the Grub-Street Journal , to voice his point of view in opposition to that of the booksellers and their Dunces; and he secured support and influence within the trade by setting up one of his protégés, Robert Dodsley, as a bookseller; thus, incidentally, providing the true apostolic succession in Augustan letters for, of course, it was Dr. Johnson who remarked ironically, "Doddy is my patron." Pope's phenomenal success was in one sense prophetic: it showed that potentially the new individualist and capitalist order could, under favorable conditions, make possible a much greater freedom for the writer than ever before, and this without any pandering to the taste of the masses. But Pope's personal and unrepeated triumph did not blind him to the likelihood that the main pressure of events was in a quite opposite direction, and so he declared war on the Dunces. The nineteenth-century critics were inclined to write off the war as motivated by personal spite, and this may be in part because the implications of what Goldsmith called "that fatal revolution whereby . . . booksellers, instead of the great, become the patrons and paymasters of men of genius"—were not yet so clear. Now that we have so much more reason than Dr. Johnson to insist on the distinction between a book as a "subject of commerce" and a book as an "increase of human knowledge," and so much more opportunity to observe what happens when the publishing system turns literature into a marketable commodity, we can better admit the truth of Pope's attribution of the rising flood of bad writing "not so much to malice or servility as to dulness; and not so much to dulness, as to necessity." Pope had the economic necessities of underpaid hacks in mind, but there is another kind of historical necessity, perhaps, behind the Dunces: Dr. George Cheyne, author of The English Malady , diagnosed an even more universal syndrome when he wrote to Richardson that "all booksellers I fear are Curlls by profession": publishers are sinners, we may say, not by choice but by necessity. Today, Pope's own gallant stance in the face of these intricate necessities must be allowed to excuse his malice and to authorize his pride; we know, now, that he was right to warn us against underestimating the power of the Dunces: "Do not gentle reader rest too secure in thy contempt of the Instruments for such a revolution in learning." The instruments and the revolution have now assumed giant proportions; if there was ever any hyperbole in the famous lines about the coming triumph of Dulness time has rendered it almost imperceptible: She comes! she comes! the sable throne behold Of Night primeval, and of Chaos old . . . Lo! thy dread empire, Chaos! is restored, Light dies before thy uncreating word. If the writer's laws the writer's patrons give, and if today the well-patronized publishers of Time, Confidential and the comic books laugh all the way to the bank, can we in the academy, who have inherited the tradition which Pope defended, find any other comfort than the reflection which Lord Chesterfield made, with the professional authors of the time in mind, as he addressed his peers: "Thank God! We, my Lords, have a dependence of another kind"?</field>

      <field name="heading_text">"My Squeamish Public": Some Problems of Victorian Magazine Publishers and Editors by Oscar Maurer *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A publishing house," Anthony West recently remarked, "is a simple business today, and a publisher considers that his first responsibility is not to culture as an abstract idea but to the investors who have provided him with his working capital." 1 Still more recently Arthur Mizener has taken the opposite view: "Publishers are all more or less bad businessmen because they all care to some extent for good books and are forever trying to publish them. It's a mug's game and as businessmen they know it." 2 Both these knowledgeable observers of the twentieth-century literary scene cite striking examples to support their apparently irreconcilable opinions. The question remains open: is a publisher's responsibility primarily to author and public, as his own literary and social conscience may dictate? Or is it primarily to the financial success of his firm—more bluntly, to his own pocket-book? To use a Victorian distinction, is publishing a liberal profession, or a trade? The answer cannot, of course, be drawn out in black and white. Publishers have been called Maecenas and Barabbas, perhaps with equal justice, equal inaccuracy. The answer, so far as it can be arrived at, will come from an understanding of the subtle web of interacting influences which unites author, publisher, and reader—or, if you prefer, producer, distributor, and consumer. As a step toward understanding such influences, consider a chapter in literary history in which they are to be studied with a fair amount of perspective: the fortunes and misfortunes of Victorian magazines and reviews, their publishers, editors, contributors, and readers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I From the beginning to the end of the Victorian period the fact that a successful periodical must be financially profitable, must supply a demand, was realized and accepted or deplored. In the eighteen-thirties Carlyle, then a leading contributor to Fraser's Magazine (which he variously described as a "Dog's-meat Cart," a "Scavenger-cart," a "chaotic, fermenting, dunghill heap of compost," and "one of the main cloacas of Periodical Literature") 3 wrote hopefully to John Stuart Mill: "A question often suggests itself, Whether we shall never have our own Periodical Pulpit, and exclude the Philistine therefrom, above all, keep the Pew-opener (or Bibliopolist) in his place; and so preach nothing but the sound word. 4 He was never to achieve such a pulpit. In 1833 Richard Henry Horne, poet and journalist, published his Exposition of the False Medium and Barriers Excluding Men of Genius from the Public , in which he made explicit the complaint implied by Carlyle: Nearly all the periodicals are strictly commercial in their origin and foundation, which commonly influences, directly or indirectly, all the writers which they engage. . . . Few of the very few who know and wish to say what is right, can afford to do so; neither can they afford to be silent. Hence the periodicals in general, while they seem to lead, only follow public opinion, which is a far more profitable proceeding. 5 At mid-century and after, the success of two magazines edited by their publishers (John Blackwood, who edited his firm's monthly from 1845 to 1879, and George Smith, actual editor of the Cornhill in the sixties) 6 led some observers to believe that such a system was a practical solution to the problem. After his unsuccessful venture as editor of St. Pauls Magazine Anthony Trollope (whose knowledge of the economics of literature was extensive and peculiar) admitted that he had occasionally been too soft to his contributors: I think, upon the whole, that publishers themselves have been the best editors of magazines. . . . The proprietor, at any rate, knows what he wants and what he can afford, and is not so frequently tempted to fall into that worst of literary quicksands, the publishing of matter not for the sake of the readers, but for that of the writer. . . . The object of the proprietor is to produce a periodical that shall satisfy the public . 7 And in a reminiscent tribute to John Blackwood, the Reverend A. K. H. Boyd, a voluminous and popular contributor to mid-Victorian magazines, expressed the same opinion: I am quite sure that a publisher makes the best Editor. He is much less likely than a man of letters to fill a periodical with unreadable papers which echo his own crotchets. He is much more accurate. He is absolutely without jealousy. He knows nothing but the success of his magazine or review. Some editors are like certain unpopular clerics of my youth, who would much rather have their churches empty than filled for them by some better preacher. 8 Both these apologists for success assumed that the publisher's criterion would naturally be commercial, and tacitly approved. Other mid-Victorian observers made the same assumption, but deplored the results. Writing in Bradlaugh's iconoclastic National Reformer on the controversy over Swinburne's Poems and Ballads , James Thomson let out a characteristic growl: Periodicals—newspapers, magazines, reviews—are the Fools' Paradise of the commonplace, the mediocre, the orthodox, the respectable. . . . A periodical to live must be a commercial success; the faintest thrill of new ideas would affect its circulation by shocking off some of its regular readers; it must suit its articles to the size of its customers—a very little hat for a very little head, a very little thought for a very little brain. 9 Thomson, whose militant atheism kept him out of respectable journals, may have been expressing a personal pique. But a more cautious commentator, "Matthew Browne" (William Brighty Rands), an indefatigable contributor to the reviews, echoed his sentiments a few years later—in spite of the efforts of Morley in the Fortnightly and Knowles in the Nineteenth Century to maintain open forums for the expression of all shades of opinion: Since the time when Jeffrey ruled the Edinburgh , and even since the death of Mr. Napier, 'the advertising element' and commercial elements in general have played a great and new part, an increasing part too, in the fortunes, and thus in regulating the quality and tendency, of current literature. One result of this state of things is an ever-inceasing tendency to compromise in the expression of opinion. In spite of the spirit of tolerance of which we hear so much, there was perhaps never a time in which the expression of opinion was so much emasculated in the higher periodical literature, or in which so much trickery of accommodated phraseology was going forward. This will last for a long time yet—as long as perodical literature is a matter of commercial speculation. 10 At the end of the century, when Newnes, Pearson, Harmsworth, and their followers had pushed their mass-circulation periodicals to the half-million mark and beyond, an ambitious and somewhat cold-eyed young journalist then known as Enoch Arnold Bennett commented in the Academy on the "revolution in journalism." (Bennett had served as sub-editor and then as editor of a weekly called Woman , which bore on its cover the motto "Forward! But Not Too Fast"): The old autocrats of Maga and Cornhill may be conceived as saying to their readers: 'This is good for you; in consideration of a just payment we permit you to read it.' And when those august periodicals were issued, the readers approached the perusal of them, certainly with some pleasure, but also with the austere and braced feeling of duty to be performed. The modern editor proceeds upon a different path. He explores the nature of the demand as patiently and thoroughly as a German manufacturer. With a mixture of logic and cynicism he states boldly that what people ought to want is no affair of his, and in ascertaining precisely what they in fact do want he never loses sight of the great philosophical truth that man is a frail creature. He assiduously ministers to human infirmities. 11 Here we are plainly approaching the realm of pre-tested consumer response, if not of the engineering of consent. A few examples may further enlighten some of the problems that had to be faced by publishers, editors, and contributors. John Black-wood, whose magazine was solidly successful in the middle years of the century, once told a young journalist his formula: I don't, he said, engage the regular literary man. He is apt to be too maniéré. I look out for a man who, say a Dean, has gone in for bee culture for an article—never mind the writing, we will see to that, so long as it has facts. . . . So I get the freshness and knowledge which attract and keep readers. 12 In 1869 John Murray (third of the honorable name) co-operated in the establishment of the Academy , a learned monthly to consist of signed articles by experts; its editor, C. E. C. B. Appleton, hoped to model it on such scholarly German reviews as the Literarisches Centralblatt . Murray had doubts from the start: "No exclusively learned periodical in this country has ever survived to become profitable," he told Appleton on seeing a specimen number. But he helped by his prestige and connections to launch the journal, even contributing an unpublished Byron letter from the family archives to the first number— a concession to sensational journalism which embarrassed the scholarly Appleton. Murray was alarmed by the uncompromisingly learned tone of the Academy , especially, it seems, by the reproduction of cuneiform and Syriac characters in some of the articles. His friend Mrs. Grote suggested that it would be easy "to dilute it with a dash of Athenaeum-like twaddle"; Appleton naturally refused; and after a few months Murray bowed out, taking a considerable financial loss by the surrender of his copyright. 13 The Fortnightly Review exemplified another sort of publisher-editor relationship. John Morley (editor, 1867-82) made it a vital journal of "liberalism, free-thinking, and open inquiry," and recruited a distinguished group of contributors, including Mill, Arnold, Huxley, and Leslie Stephen. The publisher, Frederic Chapman of Chapman and Hall, Morley recalled, was "a thorough Philistine, hating all our views"; and yet, since the Fortnightly was making a profit, Chapman refused to sell it to Morley for three times what he had paid for it. 14 Later, during Frank Harris's editorship, Chapman apparently asserted himself and began to censor the contents of the magazine, provoking Harris's rueful reminiscence: I had to be taught that to edit a review in London is not to be a priest in the Temple of the Spirit, but the shopman pander to a childish public with a gigantic appetite for what is conventional and commonplace. 15 Consider also the difficulties of William Ernest Henley during his five-year editorship of Cassell's Magazine of Art . John Cassell, who had begun life as a temperance lecturer, had launched a number of highly successful family magazines; it was a house rule that beer, wine, or spirits could not be mentioned, nor represented pictorially, in a Cassell publication. Henley as art critic submitted to this regulation. But his praise of Corot, Whistler, and Rodin, his disparagement of moral and literary criteria in the judgment of art, were too advanced for Cassell's readers. Circulation dropped, and Henley resigned. 16</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Three sensitive areas—religion, politics and economics, and morals —especially inspired caution in publishers and editors in their role of protecting readers from contributors. The religious controversies of the sixties and seventies were dangerous ground. George Smith's Cornhill is a case in point. Thackeray in his prospectus (1859) set forth the principles which the magazine was to follow: At our social table we shall suppose the ladies and children always present; we shall not set rival politicians by the ears; we shall listen to every guest who has an apt word to say, and I hope induce clergymen of various denominations to say grace in their turn. 17 The result, as Leslie Stephen later remarked, was "an unprecedented shillings-worth . . . limited to the inoffensive." In his desire to avoid offense, Thackeray asked Frederick Locker to change the last line in "My Neighbour Rose" from "God go with her" to "Joy go with her": the mention of the Deity in a light love-poem, he felt, might cause objections. 18 When Stephen became editor in 1871, he replied to a friend's congratulations with a complaint about Smith's policies: "What can one make of a magazine which excludes the only subjects in which reasonable men take any interest: politics and religion?" 19 Already known as an agnostic, he had to warn contributors against possible alienation of readers. When James Sully, for example, proposed an article on pessimism, Stephen warned him not to mention Schopenhauer. "The ordinary parson, who is the general object of my dread, has never heard of Schopenhauer; but he may vaguely scent infidelity in a German name." 20 It was apparently George Smith who intervened to suspend Matthew Arnold's Literature and Dogma , breaking off the series rather awkwardly after the second instalment (October, 1871) as "too explosive" for the Cornhill . 21 He had previously rejected George Meredith's "Martin's Puzzle" for its "free-thinking opinions." While personally admiring the poem, he wrote to Meredith, "it would offend many of his readers." 22 One striking phenomenon of Victorian publishing was the magazine for "Sunday Reading," and the most successful of this kind was Good Words , edited by Norman Macleod and published by Alexander Strahan. It was a remarkable monthly, especially distinguished for its wood engravings and for its eclectic range of articles, verse, and fiction; by the mid-sixties it had a circulation of 110,000—larger, according to Strahan, than that of any other magazine in England or America. Macleod, one of Queen Victoria's chaplains and a well known Glasgow clergyman, had Strahan's support in attempting to improve the literary quality of reading matter acceptable to religious families. But he was soon attacked by the Evangelicals for admitting contributions from such liberal clergymen as Charles Kingsley and Dean Stanley. When he advertised a novel by Anthony Trollope, the Evangelical Record (which perhaps remembered Mr. Slope and Mrs. Proudie) threatened that Good Words should be "crushed." Trollope's Rachel Ray , which Macleod had requested and for which he had agreed to pay £1000, could not appear in Good Words . After a considerable portion had been set up in type it was returned, and Strahan paid a £500 forfeit at Trollope's threat of legal action. Trollope's account of the affair in his Autobiography is perhaps not quite fair to Macleod: There is some dancing in one of the early chapters, described, no doubt, with that approval of the amusement which I have always entertained; and it was to this that my friend demurred. 23 And he wrote to John Millais: Good Words has thrown me over. They write me word that I am too wicked. . . . They have tried to serve God and the devil together, and finding that goodness pays best, have thrown over me and the devil. . . . I am altogether unsuited to the regenerated. 24 Actually Rachel Ray contains an even more unsympathetic picture of Low-Church activities than Barchester Towers . As Macleod wrote to Trollope, "You cast a gloom over Dorcas societies, and a glory over balls lasting until four in the morning . . . enough to keep Good Words and its editor in boiling water until either or both were boiled to death." 25 Granted the legitimacy of Trollope's satire on the Evangelicals, Good Words was obviously not the place to publish it; Macleod, I think, was honest when he denied to Trollope that he "sacrificed you to the vile Record and to the cry it and its followers have raised against you, as well as me." 26 Trollope, at any rate, continued to contribute to Good Words . And yet such concessions to puritanism gave rise to a legend about "Sunday magazines"; here is one form of it: It was the editor of one of these magazines who is said, though I do not vouch for the truth of the story, to have implored the author, who was running a novel through his columns, to shift the date on which he had made his lovers meet from Saturday afternoon to "Sunday after church time," in deference to the susceptibilities of his subscribers. 27 It was not only family magazines like the Cornhill and magazines for Sunday reading like Good Words which had to be careful to avoid offense in religious matters. Huxley's chapter on the critical reception of Darwin's Origin of Species , contributed to the authorized biography of Darwin, shows how far scientific thought was modified in the reviews by what Darwin called odium theologicum . Later, when James Knowles was making Strahan's Contemporary Review into a menagerie of lions, he welcomed Huxley's defense of The Descent of Man . But he drew the line at Francis Galton's "Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer," which had also been refused by George Grove for Macmillan's Magazine . Knowles wrote to Galton: I am afraid that after all my courage is not greater than Grove's. You will think that editors are a "feeble folk," and so perhaps they are, but it is certain that our constituents (who are largely clergymen) must not be tried much further just now by proposals following Tyndall's friend on prayer—and of a similar bold,—or as you yourself say, "audacious character." 28 The essay was finally accepted by Morley for the Fortnightly . After Knowles had left the Contemporary and started the Nineteenth Century —an open forum for the encouragement of the star system, some critics called it—he still felt the need of caution. The controversy between Gladstone and Huxley on the scientific validity of the book of Genesis, in the mid-eighties, was an editor's dream; for an impresario like Knowles nothing could have been better. But he asked Huxley to revise one article as too "pungent," and Huxley replied: "I spent three mortal hours this morning taming my wild cat. He is now castrated; his claws are cut." 29 Knowles had left the Contemporary when Strahan incorporated his firm with the support of Samuel Morley and other prominent Nonconformists in 1877. Strahan had perhaps been disturbed by the furore resulting from the publication of W. K. Clifford's article on "The Ethics of Belief." 30 His break with Knowles was somewhat acrimonious, but he assumed the editorship himself, kept up the standard of the review, and stated his position fairly enough in an article on "The Higher Controversy and Periodical Literature": The business of the editor of a periodical in which the higher controversy finds a place is not to dam out arbitrarily, but to see, as far as he can, that the waters are not poisoned by any influx of bad faith, cynical ethics, or mere folly. 31</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Another danger zone for publishers and editors was the area of political and economic dissent. Partisan and doctrinaire periodicals in which anonymity encouraged the following of a consistent "line" were standard during the first half of the century. An exile in England in 1839, Mazzini attempted to write for a living but found it difficult. "I write for the quarterly reviews," he told an Italian friend, "and for the magazines (monthly reviews),—often uselessly because they refuse all ideas that are too daring, too general, too systematic, too continental as they say." 32 Carlyle's unorthodox views (and style) also caused editorial difficulties. When Sartor was appearing in Fraser's (a strange companion to the rowdy Toryism of Maginn and Lockhart), Poor Fraser [Carlyle later told M. D. Conway] who had courageously undertaken it, found himself in great trouble. The public had no liking whatever for that kind of thing. Letters lay piled mountain high on his table, the burden of them being, "Either stop sending your magazine to me, or stop printing that crazy stuff about clothes." I advised him to hold on a little longer, and asked if there were no voices in a contrary sense. "Just two— a Mr. Emerson, of New England, and a Catholic priest at Cork." These said, "Send me Fraser so long as 'Sartor' continues in it." 33 Even after Carlyle had established his reputation with the French Revolution he found no editor willing to publish "Chartism" (1839) in a reputable review. It was intended, he told Emerson, for the Quarterly Review : The Quarterly Review was not an eligible vehicle, but the eligiblest; of Whigs [i.e. the Edinburgh ], abandoned to Dilettantism and withered sceptical conventionality, there was no hope at all; the London and Westminster Radicals, wedded to their Benthamee Formulas, and tremulous at their own shadows, expressly rejected my proposal many months ago: Tories alone remained. . . . Finally the thing came out, as an Essay on Chartism ; was shown to Lockhart, according to agreement; was praised by him, but was also found unsuitable by him; suitable to explode a whole fleet of Quarterlies into sky-rockets in these times! 34 As Carlyle remarked, "Such an article, equally astonishing to Girondins, Radicals, do-nothing Aristocrats, Conservatives, and unbelieving Dilettante Whigs, can hope for no harbour in any Review." 35 And ten years later John Forster had to cut Carlyle's article on the fall of Louis Philippe and suppress a sequel; their "excessive candour," he said, "might damage the circulation of the Examiner ." 36 Carlyle's friend and disciple James Anthony Froude, as editor of Fraser's in the sixties, agreed with his master in condoning Negro slavery and favoring the South in the American Civil War. It is therefore to his credit that at a time when, as John Mill remarked, there was a "rush of nearly the whole of the middle and upper classes, even those who passed for Liberals, into a furious pro-Southern partisanship," Froude accepted Mill's plea for the Northern cause, "The Contest in America" (January, 1862). 37 In publishing it, however, Froude departed from the usual practice of Fraser's and gave the author's name; he protected himself in the same way when he accepted anti-slavery and pro-Lincoln articles by Moncure Conway, which were signed "By an American Abolitionist." 38 Here Fraser's seemed more enlightened than the Cornhill . Thackeray asked Bayard Taylor for an article stating the case for the North, but George Smith vetoed it as controversial (and unpopular). 39 Froude, however, did refuse to publish an anti-Prussian article by Sarah Austin in 1866, though backed by authentic facts; he was glad, he said, "to see a great Protestant power established in the north of Europe." 40 The Fortnightly under Frank Harris, as we have seen, was a trial to its publishers. A sensational series on Czarist tyranny in Russia by "E. B. Lanin" caused an increase in sales but also, apparently, objections from the Foreign Office (as well as an appeal from Swinburne for tyrannicide). Hence, according to a historian of the Fortnightly , before another editor was appointed, a clause was inserted in his agreement, providing that the proposed table of contents of each number should be submitted four days before going to press to the managing director of Chapman and Hall, who should be entitled to exercise a veto upon any article, poem, or story, which he might not approve. 41 After Harris's departure, it should be added, the custom lapsed: the new editor, W. J. Courtney, was emphatically a safe man. Unorthodox economic and social views were also productive of trouble. John Parker, publisher and editor of Fraser's in the forties, sympathized with the lively Christian radicalism of Charles Kingsley. But Kingsley's chaotic novel, Yeast , and especially some verses on the Game-laws ("There's blood on the game you sell, Squire") infuriated propertied readers and brought complaints and cancellations. At Parker's request, Kingsley brought the serial to an abrupt conclusion. 42 Even unfavorable mention of some unpopular names was forbidden. The Quarterly , in attacking the Co-operative movement, listed (as was the custom) a half-dozen books on the subject at the head of its article. But one of them was George Jacob Holyoake's History of the Rochdale Pioneers ; the editor could not include Holyoake's name, for fear of scandal, and so omitted all the writers' names. "For the first time," Holyoake noted with amusement, "an article in the Quarterly was devoted to six nameless authors." 43 Henry Adams, too, found that some subjects were untouchable in respectable reviews. His article on "The Gold Conspiracy" was rejected by Henry Reeve of the Edinburgh . "One knew," Adams recorded in his Education , "that the power of Erie was almost as great in England as in America, but one was hardly prepared to find it controlling the Quarterlies." And yet, "for fear of Jay Gould and Jim Fisk" Reeve and the Longmans would not risk the publication. 44 Perhaps the most glaring instance of this problem, as involving economics, was the case of John Ruskin, Unto This Last, Munera Pulveris , the Cornhill , and Fraser's . Ruskin, who had contributed at Thackeray's request to early numbers of the Cornhill , in the summer of 1860 sent the manuscript of his first essays attacking the orthodox economic theory to William Smith Williams, George Smith's reader, with this word: I send you some Political Economy, which, if you can venture to use in any way for the Cornhill , stigmatizing it by any notes of reprobation which you may think necessary, I shall be very glad. All I care about is to get it into print, somehow. 45 The articles were accepted, with the stipulation that initials be signed; the editor, according to Ruskin's father, "would not be answerable for opinions so opposed to Malthus and the Times and the City of London." Objections began at once; the Saturday Review was especially bitter, remarking that these were "eruptions of windy hysterics" and that England would refuse to be "preached to death by a mad governess." The result is best told in Ruskin's own words: The editor of the Magazine was my friend, and ventured the insertion of the three first essays; but the outcry against them became then too strong for any editor to endure, and he wrote to me, with great discomfort to himself, and many apologies to me, that the Magazine must only admit one Economical Essay more. 46 The series was accordingly stopped. There was no quarrel between Ruskin and Thackeray or Smith as a result, but Ruskin "sulked," as he said, "all winter." The violent reprobation of his essays in the Cornhill , Ruskin later remarked, made him think more gravely on the subject, and he resolved to make it the central concern of his life. Two years afterward Froude wrote Ruskin saying that he believed there was something in his theories and would risk the admission into Fraser's of what he chose to write on "this dangerous subject." Ruskin thereupon sent four articles which were published as "Essays on Political Economy, Being a Sequel to Papers which appeared in the 'Cornhill Magazine.'" Fraser's was sold by Parker to the Longmans in 1863 (the last of Ruskin's essays appeared in April of that year). Then, as Ruskin explained, "though the Editor had not wholly lost courage, the Publisher indignantly interfered; and the readers of Fraser , as those of the Cornhill , were protected, for that time, from farther disturbance on my part." 47 His articles were later published as Munera Pulveris . In the same year Ruskin was attacked for his views on the gold standard by J. E. Cairnes in Macmillan's Magazine . Froude asked him to reply in Fraser's and Ruskin sent him "Gold: A Dialogue." But this time the elder Ruskin apparently interceded for the suppression of the article, for his son's unconventional views had caused him pain. 48 Ruskin's experience was significant in that a decade or so later he could probably have found a free platform in the Fortnightly or the Contemporary or the Nineteenth Century , to all of which controversy carried on by "big names" was the breath of life. But editorial caution died hard. In 1873 the semi-legendary Delane of The Times shied away from allowing an article on Samuel Butler's Erewhon; it was too dangerous for the "organ of the common, satisfied, well-to-do Englishman," as Matthew Arnold called it. " Erewhon ," Delane told a member of his reviewing staff, "I won't touch. It could not be reviewed as favorably as perhaps it deserves without alarming the goodies—and they are powerful." 49 And at the end of the century the young H. G. Wells found that the new mass magazines were cramping to new or unfamiliar ideas. He wrote to his father (December, 1898): "I'm under a contract to do stories for the Strand Magazine but I don't like the job. It's like talking to fools, you can't let yourself go or they won't understand. If you send them anything a bit novel they are afraid their readers won't understand." 50</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Finally, publishers and editors were concerned to protect their readers from moral shock. 50a Observers at mid-century and later commented frequently on the improvement in the moral tone of the press, looking back to such scurrilous and indecent journals of the twenties and thirties as Theodore Hook's John Bull , Charles Molloy Westmacott's Age , Barnard Gregory's Satirist , and Renton Nicholson's Town . 51 One cause was the wide circulation of "improving" journals aimed at the lower-middle and upper-working-class reader. In 1836 a witness before the Select Committee on Arts and Principles of Design described how his firm, with their steam printing machines, produced the Penny Magazine (published by Charles Knight and sponsored by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge), the Saturday Magazine (published by Parker for the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge), and Chambers's Journal . "And every Saturday," he said, "I have the satisfaction of reflecting that 360,000 of these useful publications are issued to the public, diffusing science and taste and good feeling, without one sentence of an immoral tendency in the whole." 52 Another cause—and symptom—was the success of Punch : Bradbury and Evans, publisher, and Mark Lemon, editor, took pride in the fact that " Punch has blotted out the Age and the Satirist , and other vile publications which, before Punch existed, were the only amusing journals of the day." 53 Thackeray in 1854 commented characteristically on the change. Humor, he said, is a satyr: But we have washed, combed, and taught the rogue good manners. . . . Frolicsome always, he has become gentle and harmless, smitten into shame by the pure presence of our women and the sweet confiding smiles of our children. 54 By the end of the century W. T. Stead could remark approvingly, in a review of the republication of the first fifty years of Punch: The reader may examine every page of these twenty-five volumes without finding a single specimen of the indecent cartoon, or the more or less questionable innuendo. . . . You might read Punch from beginning to end without ever being reminded of the existence of the demi-monde . 55 And a commentator in the Quarterly noted that this moral tone was financially profitable. "If the literary level of the weekly press be low," he wrote, "its morals are irreproachable. Fortunately it has been found that immorality and indecency do not pay. . . . A print such as the Vie Parisienne , the Gil Blas , or the Petit Journal pour Rire would not live for a month in London." 56 One important function of periodicals is of course reviewing and literary criticism, current or retrospective; here the caution of publishers and editors, and the alleged sensitiveness of readers, operated significantly to limit free expression. An essay by William Hale White on "The Morality of Byron's Corsair," for example, was rejected by Strahan for the Contemporary as "a defense of immorality." 57 When Swinburne in the early sixties attempted to hoax Richard Hutton of the Spectator with a review of an imaginary Baudelairean French poet ( Les Abîmes , by Ernest Clouet), Hutton was understandably hesitant. "Les Abîmes are in type," he wrote Swinburne, "but I cannot say I think they will appear. The subject seems to me to deserve no more criticism than a Holywell Street publication, nor could I speak of it in the Spectator without more real disgust than your article inspires. There is a tone of raillery about it which I think one should hardly use to pure obscenity." 58 After his experience with the reviews of Poems and Ballads in 1866, Swinburne replied with a blast at the prudery of the journals: The disease, of course, afflicts the meanest members of the body with most virulence. Nowhere is cant at once so foul-mouthed and so tight-laced as in the penny, twopenny, threepenny, or sixpenny press. . . . The virtue of our critical journals is a dowager of somewhat dubious antecedents; every day that thins and shrivels her cheek thickens and hardens the paint on it. 59 Since John Morley had referred to him in the Saturday Review as "the libidinous laureate of a pack of satyrs," his indignation was perhaps pardonable. Admirers in England of Walt Whitman found it difficult to express their critical admiration for him in reputable periodicals. Edward Dowden had a laudatory article on Whitman turned down by the Cornhill and by Macmillan's ; it was finally accepted by the Contemporary , then (1869) edited by Dean Alford. Strahan approved, and the article was set up (though Dowden admitted that he felt Whitman out of place in such a clerical company as the Contemporary would introduce him to). At the last minute Alford objected: the article was too "dangerous," too "alarming," to appear. It finally came out in the Westminster . In Dowden's first contribution, it should be noted, on "French Aesthetics," Alford had asked him to change the word "nude" ("an indecent, or rather, a nice word"); Dowden substituted "unclothed." 60 Refusal to publish critical opinions if the subject-matter was unacceptable seems to have been the rule rather than the exception. George Moore was not allowed to publish in the Fortnightly a defense of Henry Vizetelly, prosecuted for publishing translations of Zola in England. H. W. Massingham, the distinguished editor of the Daily Chronicle in the nineties, stated his intention of defending the scientific value of Havelock Ellis's Sexual Inversion in his paper. When the book was suppressed as obscene, however, the Daily Chronicle attacked it as morbid and scientifically worthless. "The courts of law and the criticisms of the press," Massingham wrote, "are the responsible organs of public opinion in such matters." 61 It was in the censorship of creative writing—principally of fiction— that the publishers and editors of Victorian magazines found the most pressing need to interfere with their contributors to avoid giving offense to their readers. While serving as editor of Bentley's Miscellany in 1837, Dickens wrote to an unnamed author of a paper which had been delayed in publication: Mr. Bentley considers it too broad, although it does not strike me as so broad, as to render its insertion dangerous. The question is, whether you can so alter it, as to make the doubtful lady a mantua-maker and give the interview more of a "courting" character. 62 In 1880 William Blackwood, who succeeded his uncle John as editor of the family magazine, warned a contributor about a passage in a serial novel. "Parsons," he said, "will tolerate any amount of looseness if you don't point it against themselves, and in a novel of this kind we do not want to provoke the Parsons." 63 Ten years later, in setting up his immensely successful Weekly , Arthur Pearson proclaimed as his motto "To Interest, to Elevate, to Amuse"; he promised a supply of pure fiction as well as the "tit-bits" of curious information which his master, George Newnes, had found so profitable; and he assured his readers that "from title to imprint no word or suggestion will ever appear that is capable of giving offense to the most fastidious." 64 The history of the Cornhill —conducted for forty years under what Leslie Stephen called "the moral code proper to a popular magazine, the first commandment of which is 'Thou shalt not shock a young lady'" 65 furnishes perhaps the best examples of this phase of the problem. Mrs. Browning, contributing at Thackeray's request, sent "Lord Walter's Wife" (1861) and Thackeray rejected it, with apologies: You see that our Magazine is written not only for men and women, but for boys, girls, infants, sucklings almost, and one of the best wives, mothers, women in the world, writes some verses, which I feel certain would be objected to by many of our readers—Not that the writer is not pure, and the moral tone pure chaste and right—but there are things my squeamish public will not hear on Mondays though on Sundays they listen to them without scruple. In your poem you know there is an account of unlawful passion felt by a man for a woman—and though you write pure doctrine and real modesty and pure ethics, I am sure our readers would make an outcry, and so I have not published this poem. 66 When Thackeray turned down Trollope's short story "Mrs. General Talboys" on the ground that allusion is made in it to a man with illegitimate children and to a woman not as pure as she should be, Trollope wrote understandingly: An impartial Editor must do his duty. Pure morals must be supplied. And the owner of the responsible name must be the index of the purity. A writer for a periodical makes himself subject to this judgement by undertaking such work, and a man who allows himself to be irritated because judgement goes against himself is an ass. He defended himself none the less by reference to other novelists, including Thackeray. "You speak of the squeamishness of 'our people,'" he added. "Are you not magnanimous enough to feel that you write urbi et orbi:—for the best and wisest of English readers; and not mainly for the weakest?" 67 Leslie Stephen, editor in the seventies, had to continue such censorship. His troubles with Thomas Hardy will be discussed later; other contributors were also carefully watched. "The fear of Mrs. Grundy was ever before his eyes, and this rendered him inexorable," W. E. Norris recalled. 68 And in the nineties when Reginald Smith, George Smith's son-in-law, became editor, contributors complained of his propriety: he would not permit such words as "stays" or "corsets" to appear in the magazine. 69 A number of Victorian writers, including Trollope, Charles Reade, and Wilkie Collins, were made to undergo bowdlerization by magazine editors. 70 The most striking example of this was Thomas Hardy, who was plagued during his whole career as novelist by problems of this sort. When two instalments of Far from the Madding Crowd had appeared in the Cornhill , Leslie Stephen wrote urging that Fanny's seduction be treated in a gingerly fashion. "I mean," he wrote, "that the thing must be stated, but that the words must be careful." Complaints from readers had been received about a passage of rustic humor already published. When the novel appeared in book form, the Times singled out the very passage for quotation and commendation, and Hardy was triumphant. Stephen replied, "I spoke as editor, not as man. You have no more consciousness of these things than a child." 71 So in The Hand of Ethelberta Stephen asked Hardy to change "amorous" to "sentimental," and to "Remember the country parson's daughters. I have always to remember them!" After reading the opening chapters of The Return of the Native , Stephen feared that the story would develop into something dangerous for a family magazine, and Hardy wrote no more for the Cornhill . 72 In Belgravia , however, where the novel did appear, it had to be substantially softened, especially as to the past actions and future intentions of the tempestuous Eustacia. 73 The Mayor of Casterbridge, A Group of Noble Dames , and Tess all were subjected to similar censorship in the Graphic, The Woodlanders in Macmillan's , and Jude in Harper's (American and English editions simultaneously). Before sending Jude Hardy had promised that it would be "a tale that could not offend the most fastidious maiden"; but the first instalments brought protest from H. M. Alden, editor of Harper's . He wrote, "My objections are based on a purism (not mine, but our readers'), which is undoubtedly more rigid here than in England." Hardy agreed to bowdlerize. He must have known, however, that British standards were if anything stricter than American, for A Group of Noble Dames and parts of Tess had appeared uncensored in Harper's Weekly and Bazar , purified in the Graphic . 74 The changes Hardy made for magazine publication were partly verbal: "lewd," "loose," and "bawdy" in Far from the Madding Crowd , for example, appeared in the Cornhill as "gross," "wicked," and "sinful." 75 More substantial changes, such as the omission of the seduction scene in Tess and the substitution of a mock marriage, were more damaging to the structure and characterization of the novels. 76 Hardy restored and revised for book publication nearly all that the caution of editors had made him modify; but marginal notes on his manuscripts ("deleted against author's wish, by compulsion of Mrs. Grundy," for example) show how he felt. In an article on "Candour in English Fiction," published in the New Review in 1890, he made his views explicit. Magazines and circulating libraries, as media for "household reading," tend to exterminate by monopolizing all literary space the novel "which reflects and reveals life." Not only do they pre-empt the market, but they modify the shape of the product: The opening scenes of the would-be great story may, in a rash moment, have been printed in some popular magazine before the remainder is written; as it advances month by month the situations develop, and the writer asks himself, what will his characters do next? What would probably happen to them, given such beginnings? On his life and conscience, though he had not foreseen the thing, only one event could possibly happen, and that therefore he should narrate, as he calls himself a faithful artist. But, though pointing a fine moral, it is just one of those issues which are not to be mentioned in respectable magazines and select libraries. The dilemma then confronts him, he must either whip and scourge those characters into doing something contrary to their natures, to produce the spurious effect of their being in harmony with social forms and ordinances, or, by leaving them alone to act as they will, he must bring down the thunders of respectability upon his head, not to say ruin his editor, his publisher, and himself. 77 Hardy's conclusion was that as a vehicle for fiction dealing with human feeling on a comprehensive scale the magazine was tottering to its fall, and might as well assume openly the position it already covertly occupied, that of a purveyor of tales for the youth of both sexes. A reply appeared in Macmillan's in the following month, probably by Mowbray Morris, the editor who had warned Hardy about The Woodlanders ("If you can contrive not to bring the fair Miss Suke to too open shame, it would be as well. Let the human frailty be construed mild"). 78 It was no answer, but an appeal to the past in defense of the status quo: He must be a very remarkable novelist who does not think that form of publication good enough for him which has satisfied Thackeray, Dickens, Lytton, Lever, Whyte Melville, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, Anthony Trollope, the Kingsleys, Charles Reade, Wilkie Collins, Miss Braddon, Mr. Blackmore, Mr. Besant, Mr. Meredith and Mr. Thomas Hardy! So we will leave the editors and their magazines alone. 79 One recurrent theme may have been noted in this examination of the problem. Editors and publishers, in warning and censoring contributors, implied a double standard of judgment in protecting the reader. It was "my squeamish public"; it was "a purism not mine but our readers'." "Forgive this shred of concession to popular stupidity," Leslie Stephen wrote to Hardy, "but I am a slave." I think there is no hypocrisy here. Editors and publishers acted in this matter under a complex of influences: economic pressures, literary conscience, social and political and religious influences all played their part. It is doubtless just to say that the reading public got, from publisher and editor, the kind of periodicals it deserved. But public demand — the satisfaction of the reader, as Trollope called it — was considered a legitimate influence. It was a part of the Victorian compromise — a serving of God and Mammon, of which Dickens, with his sensitivity to the circulation of Household Words and All the Year Round , was a conspicuous example. But the compromise is potent today in the affairs of the few gallant survivors ("quality" or "upper-middle-brow") from the great age of periodicals. For, setting aside subsidized specialist journals and little magazines, the publisher must keep his readers or perish. The result is bound to be conservatism in ideas, opinions, and literary forms. The successful editor, however, can adjust the conflicting demands of publisher and contributor without either alienating his readers or (at the other extreme) merely supplying what they are supposed to want. That he must occasionally strain his literary and intellectual conscience in doing so, this glimpse of some Victorian prototypes has demonstrated.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Melville and the Common Reader by William Charvat *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Melville's career in fiction reflects almost all those tensions between the artist and society which sometimes make literature and sometimes mar it. He was, first of all, out of harmony with a predominantly female fiction-reading public. It is a crude but not misleading index to taste in his time that Moby Dick , a thoroughly masculine book which few women have liked, sold only 2,500 copies in its first five years and less than 3,000 in its first twenty, whereas The Scarlet Letter , in identical periods, sold 10,800 and 25,200. Second, Melville's effective career came to an end at an unfortunate moment. Though the fiction-reading audience on the Atlantic coast had begun to stratify in the 1840's, it was a decade before reader-levels in the national market were clearly defined. Melville's proper level was the upper middle class, where, in the 1850's, literary taste was beginning to be interpreted and guided by the editors of national monthly magazines like Harper's and the Atlantic . Central to Melville's problem was the fact that he entered this magazine world only in 1853, when his reputation was already ruined. All his earlier work was published in book form, 1 and was offered to an undifferentiated audience of men, women, and children among whom there was, of course, a fantastic range of sophistication and seriousness. Thus it was possible for a leading critic to label Typee and Omoo as "vendible," "venomous," and "venereous," and for a Cleveland bookseller to advertise the same titles as "Books for Little Folks." I shall be using the term "common reader" glibly, realizing that it refers to mentalities as different as "the superficial skimmer of pages" (Melville's phrase) and what Albert Guérard calls "the alert non-professional reader." In Melville criticism one locates the common reader by ear, as it were. His professional readers are more easily identified. They were not university men for whom, as in our time, literature exists in its own right, but reviewers for newspapers and magazines whose first allegiance was not to art but to the immediate interests of society. In other words, the great majority of Melville's responsible critics functioned precisely as does the Henry Luce reviewing staff today. The difference between his common readers and his critics emerges clearly in their responses to his public personality. From first to last, Melville was known by friend and foe alike as a vibrant, fascinating stylist whose moods, ranging from the gay, fanciful, playful, funny, and impudent, to the sombre and meditative, were those of a living, colorful person. Because it was an intimate style, the common readers took it to be an expression of all that Melville was, and typed him as a free-wheeling bachelor-sailor with a gift for narrative. It was inevitable that they should have tried to exploit his personality ("Typee Melville" and "Mr. Omoo" were common nicknames, to his shame and annoyance), just as Wolfe and Hemingway and Dylan Thomas have been exploited in our own time. The critics, on the other hand, were worried precisely because this intimate style was so palatable to readers who could be corrupted by the subversive thinking which was masked by that style. They need not have worried. All the evidence indicates that common readers skipped or ignored his persistent criticism of institutions, and did not buy those books in which thinking crowded the narrative. Melville's public personality became a debatable issue in the first paragraph of his first book. Typee begins with the words, "Six months at sea! Yes, reader, as I live, six months out of sight of land. . ." This is the cozy, person-to-person style of the journalism of the forties, which Melville was to develop so miraculously in the book beginning "Call me Ishmael." But readers of the first edition might have noticed that, in a sentence he wisely deleted later, he fenced himself off almost at once by belligerently identifying himself with "good-for-nothing tars" who disturb the luxuriating "state-room sailors." British reviewers promptly charged that no common sailor could write so well, and that therefore Melville must be a gentleman-Munchausen fabricating adventures for the mob. American readers, knowing that gentlemen sometimes sailed before the mast, either accepted his adventures as truth, or lovingly dubbed him the "American Defoe." To the end of his life his readers wished him to remain just that. Serious critics, however, suspected his sympathy with a dispossessed class and his hostility to the civilized world, and typed him as a dangerous malcontent. Still worse, not liking his ideas, they were able to attack his morals because in Typee he failed to put a protective distance between himself and his materials. Neglecting even the pseudonymity with which most American travel-writers sheltered themselves, Melville declared himself a Melville on the title page, a Gansevoort in the dedication to his uncle, and a purveyor of the "unvarnished truth" in his preface. Part of the "truth" which the critics seized upon was a drunken sexual orgy of the sailors with a crowd of native girls. Though, authorially, he specifically deplored this corruption of natives by their white "civilizers," nothing in the text suggests that, as sailor, he absented himself from these festivities. In fact, technically, he made the episode disastrously personal by saying of his naked visitors, "What a sight for us poor bachelor sailors! How avoid so dire a temptation?" With similar clumsiness, he alluded in Chapter 20 to half-naked girls dancing in the moonlight, "all over, as it were," in a way that was "almost too much for a quiet sober-minded young man like myself." Deletions in the second edition of Typee corrected some of these errors in point of view; and in Omoo he managed a detailed description of a wildly phallic native dance without seeming to be in the middle of it. 2 Though the Victorian age had begun, common readers seem not to have been offended by the voluptuous dances of his "naked houris," his cohabitation with Fayaway, or his sailor orgies — or perhaps they thought it was all fiction. Margaret Fuller of the New York Tribune spoke as common reader rather than as critic when she recommended Typee for its "pretty and spirited pictures," and declared that the "sewing societies of the country villages [would] find this the very book they wished to . . . read while assembled at their work." But the critics were appalled. Miss Fuller's employer, Horace Greeley, who saw the problem of an unstratified literary market, thought Melville a "born genius," but Typee and Omoo are "dangerous reading for those of immature intellects and unsettled principles. Not that you can put your finger on a passage positively offensive; but [these books] are "diseased in moral tone". Evidently Mr. Greeley had found something offensive to put his finger on by the time of Melville's marriage, for the Tribune reminded the bride of Fayaway in Melville's past. We need not wonder that Melville was excluded, like Poe and Whitman, from the nineteenth century hall of literary fame, to which the academy admitted only those writers who had led blameless lives. There is no evidence that Melville cared that his morals had been impugned except that he did not again, authorially, participate in the romps of sailors. But he at once set about altering the public's conception of him as a common sailor. In Omoo he carefully sets himself up as the only educated man in a crew of "reckless seamen of all nations." Early in Mardi he reports that his mates spotted him as a gentleman by his language, his table manners, and his "unguarded allusions to Belles-Lettes affairs." 3 White Jacket-Melville emphasizes his place among educated writers by referring to "my friend Dana" and "my fine countryman, Nathaniel Hawthorne." And Ishmael-Melville is a seagoing encyclopedia of the humanities, fine arts, and sciences. At the same time, though he retained his tones of journalistic intimacy, he broke through the restrictions of the journalistic vocabulary, and drew more and more freely on philosophical terminology, and on the imagery and diction of the Hebrew, classical, and Renaissance literatures. It is possible, indeed, that Melville became the most richly and learnedly allusive of romantic novelists partly in reaction against the label of "good-for-nothing tar" which he had pinned on himself. For such apostasy he paid the inevitable penalty: the journalistic world said his later work "smelled of the lamp," and called him "pretentious" and "pedantic." But he had escaped from his pigeonhole. Nevertheless, as a professional writer, chronically in debt, he not only desperately needed the common reader, but actually hoped — and for a while, believed — that it was possible "to suit at once the popular and the critical taste." The words are Poe's, and I take the latter phrase to mean, not the taste of critics (Poe knew better), but the taste that is critical — that is, the taste of the writer himself and of the few who understand him. An oft-quoted sentence by Melville seems to contradict this hope: "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." The important word here is not botches — his books may or may not be that — but hash , which asserts that he tried to write both ways at once. In more optimistic moods, he believed that he could do so successfully. It was a hope which he shared with all his great contemporaries, including Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman, and which even Henry James did not relinquish until the turn of the century. If it seems to have flickered out in our time, there are Hemingway, and Faulkner and R. P. Warren to prove its viability. Melville seems to have given it up only in his last novel, The Confidence Man , but even here we cannot be sure, for he seems to have planned a sequel to this, the most baffling of his books, after both his American and his English publishers had abandoned him as a failure. Melville's two ways of writing can be defined by analysis of the three works which he first conceived as popular books (written, that is, "the other way"), and then drastically reconceived so as to include also what he was "most moved to do." These were Mardi, Moby Dick , and Pierre . In the finished forms of all three, the popular materials remain either as a base or a starting point for the more private material which he imposed on them. I pause here to point out the impossibility of reading books so composed in the way many Melville critics try to do — that is, as structurally organic wholes all the parts of which can be schematically related to all the other parts. Melville's gift was not for unity, or integrated structure, but for diversity and digression, and he took advantage of all of what has been called the "novel's liberties and privileges." In the three re-written works, the two that he first conceived as forms of travel, Mardi and Moby Dick , are based on precisely those popular materials which predominate in his four successful travel works — loose, episodic, anecdotal narrative; information; and informal, intimate commentary. These materials the readers liked and the critics praised, even though they rejected the two books as wholes. What he was "most moved to write" he added, to Mardi , in the shape of intellectual allegory; to Moby Dick , in the Ahab drama. And it was the allegory and the drama which the public disliked. The rejection, it appears, was due primarily to Melville's shift from direct commentary to forms of thinking which the public found repulsive. The forms of thought and opinion in fiction have been a major problem for American writers from Charles Brockden Brown to William Faulkner. In writers whose thinking was generated mainly by conflicts between themselves and public beliefs and values, e.g. , Cooper, Howells, and Sinclair Lewis, ideas are usually presented through the dialectic of characters who represent different social classes, occupations, races, regions, or sexes. By and large, this form of thought has been the safest, so far as tensions between writer and reader are concerned, partly because it is so easily skipped by the reader who is anxious to get on with the narrative, partly because it is potentially so deceptive even for the critical watch-dog who seeks to identify what the author thinks with what his characters say. Such writers are most likely to get into trouble when they make direct authorial statements, or indirect ones through thin disguises, like Cooper's Major Effingham or Lewis' Arrowsmith. But if we can judge from the sales records of Cooper's novels, the common reader will stay with the author, no matter what he thinks, as long as narrative, information, and other diverting elements heavily outweigh the thinking. Cooper's readers rejected only those novels in which thought and opinion predominated. Cooper's and Howells' characteristic dialectical thinking offers the reader choices: he can take sides in the argument, or accept it in suspension, or simply ignore it. The same is true of Melville's thinking in his first two books. Moreover, in these, his thinking was chiefly about primitivism. Though some critics resented his attacks on institutions, by the 1840's the subject was being argued more sentimentally than seriously. But when in Mardi Melville began to generate ideas out of contradictions within himself, he shifted to a kind of internal dialectic which gave the reader no choice. He involved him in the very processes of thought, made him collaborate in exploratory, speculative thinking which is concerned not with commitment but with possibility. It is the one kind of thinking that the general reader will not tolerate, and the nineteenth century critic, when he detected it, declared it subversive. 4 Melville began Mardi as "another book of South Sea Adventure (continued from, tho' wholly independent of 'Omoo')," and was so sure that it would be a "hit" (his word) with the general reader that he asked of his London publisher an advance double that he had received for Omoo . His original intention survives, if at all, only in the first forty chapters. This portion differs from the earlier travel works in two respects. First, though the narrative is characteristically episodic, and in the first person, it is somewhat more fictionalized. Second, and more important, there is a new quality in the non-narrative elements. In this part of Mardi he develops what he later perfected in Moby Dick — the popular art of clear and charming exposition of natural and technological fact; and for the first time, he uses fact as a vehicle of meaning. Fact becomes occasion for meditation: the doctrinaire and contentious commentary of Typee becomes deeply personal reflection. This change in his style was widely admired as a way of combining "fact and fancy." After this beginning, however, flesh-and-blood narrative fades into the patently allegorical story of the discovery, the loss, and the search for the maiden Yillah. In terms of the intellectual purpose of the book, that search means little: in long stretches, Yillah is forgotten completely. She is not what the book is about. I suspect that she is the product of one of Melville's miscalculations of the common reader — that he invented her to provide a story-line to carry the reader along with him, and that the pursuit is about equivalent to Cooper's Indian chases, which keep the reader busy while the author interpolates materials which are of primary interest to himself. The substance and the essence of Mardi are in the discourse of the characters — in Melville's dialectic with the world and with himself. He was, of course, deserted by readers as soon as they realized that the Yillah story was bait to lure them into an intellectual jungle. In England, where, to Melville's disgust, Mardi was printed in three volumes for circulating libraries in the format of the novel, defrauded readers were indignant, and the exasperated publisher, who lost money on it, reported that "the first volume was eagerly devoured, the second was read, but the third was so ill-adapted to "the class of readers whom . . . the First Volume . . . gratified" that it virtually "stopped the sale of the book." 5 In the allegory, which was what Melville was "most moved to write," he met head-on — and disastrously — the problems of authorial identity and of dialectical speculation. As long as the narrator in Volume One has a definable personality — that of a lively, learned, meditative adventurer, like White Jacket or Ishmael, Melville's touch is sure. But after Chapter 40, when he is given the name of Taji, the narrator disintegrates. As the pursuer of Yillah he becomes a mere function of the perfunctory plot, takes no part in the discourse, and is often forgotten. The "I" of the first part tends to become "we" in the allegory, and even the "we" often disappears in a fog of authorial omniscience. Sometimes, within a brief space, Taji speaks as "we", is addressed by the author as "you", and is referred to in the third person by his companions as if he were not there. Once, even though Taji is supposed to be in the middle of the Pacific, Melville shoves him aside, and, speaking from his New York house, says, "My cheek blanches while I write . . . while I slave and faint in this cell." Though, in terms of the story, the narrator becomes Taji, in terms of the intellectual content of the book he is displaced by a set of characters who represent the component parts of Melville's new creative personality. The journalist survives as Mohi the chronicler, the purveyor of mere fact, 6 who, though he sometimes spins yarns, is treated with contempt. Yoomy is the poet in the new Melville, a tenderminded believer, impatient of raw fact, "capricious . . . swayed by contrary moods — made up of a thousand contradictions . . . [and] no one in Mardi comprehended him." The dominant character and chief talker in this trio is the philosopher and critic, Babbalanja. He is the seeker after meaning, the believer in "polysensuum", or many meanings, the enemy of the "armed and crested lies" of the world and of Philistinism. In a further fragmentation of personality, Babbalanja, whenever his discourse reaches the limits of intelligibility, is possessed by his demon, Azzageddi, who talks gibberish. In these four entities, from the factual historian to the inarticulate demon, with the poet and the militant philosopher between, we get the full range of Melville's conception of creative self. Mardi was a necessary laboratory job for Melville 7 — an exploration of his mind at precisely the moment that the able journalist was becoming an artist. As a market book, however, it was an impossibility, for it cannot be read as story — it must be studied, and the content is meaningful not for the results of thought but for the process of thinking. The book was declared, all but unanimously, 8 to be unintelligible, and it took Harpers seven years to get rid of 3,000 copies. Melville said bitterly that Mardi was "stabbed," meaning that the critics attacked not the book but the author. He and the critics were both right, for they perceived that the book was the author in a sense that fiction should never be. Moreover, the critics sensed that the book was hostile to them, to the general reader, and to the world. It is sometimes wrongly stated that it was the critical attack on Mardi that caused Melville's increasing hostility to the public. The reverse is true, for the hostility is in the book and antecedent to its failure. Its immediate source was his humiliation that Typee and Omoo , which he had outgrown by the time he finished the latter, should have earned him such cheap notoriety. He had begged his London publisher to omit "by the author of Typee and Omoo " from the title page of Mardi . Babbalanja declares that there is "more likelihood of being over-rated while living than of being under-rated when dead." And when Yoomy sings an immortal but anonymous song, the philosopher says, "This were to be truly immortal; to be perpetuated in our works, and not in our name. Let me, oh Oro! be anonymously known!" He implies that by exploiting the writer as person and trying to keep him down to the level of his poorest work, the world gives him contemporary reputation at the expense of ultimate fame. "Does not all Mardi by its action declare it is far better to be notorious now than famous hereafter? . . . To insure your fame, you must die." It was to be his bitterest pill from now on that Typee and Omoo kept on selling while his better works languished, and he predicted (what was to be true until 1920) that he would go down to posterity as a "man who lived among cannibals," and that Typee would be fed to babies along "with their gingerbread." But the deepest source of his alienation was his sudden 9 discovery of the meaning of genius and his affinity with it, and his belief that the world resents genius until time and death sterilize it. The word was used ambivalently in contemporary criticism. Though it often served as a mere compliment to the individuality of Melville's style, it was more commonly qualified by the word "but," in a context meaning that such individuality as his was not to be trusted socially. And he was all the more distrusted because in Mardi and Pierre he not only identified himself with genius but put it in invidious contrast with the common character. "Men like you and me," he wrote Hawthorne, form "a chain of God's posts round the world," and in the "boundless, trackless, but still glorious wild wilderness" which is the domain of genius, we are attacked by "Indians [who] do sorely abound, as well as [by] the insignificant but still stinging mosquitoes." The mosquitoes sting in Chapter 180 of Mardi , where Babbalanja is the spokesman for Lombardo, a mythical great artist of the past who received "coppers then, and immortal glory now." In a dialogue about Lombardo's masterpiece, the Kostanza, Melville's belief that genius is hated must have been plain to any attentive reader. Abrazza, an arch-philistine, utters stupid and spiteful platitudes about genius that are still current. Babbalanja's attempts to correct him are futile, for it is clear that Abrazza resents not literature but writers: when he has finished attacking the Kostanza, he confesses, "I never read it." Equally obvious is the soaring egotism in the chapter, "Dreams," in which, shaking himself free from all his spokesmen and writing as Melville, he allies himself with the great community of genius of all time: "In me" the great writers "recline and converse." "Blind Milton sings bass to my Petrarchs . . . and laureates crown me with bays." This egotism is capped with romantic self-pity as he speaks of "the Dionysius that rides me," so that he is "less to be envied, than the veriest hind in the land." In a dozen furious reviews of Mardi , the crucial word was "conceit." From Irving and Longfellow to James and beyond, one of the symptoms of friction between the American writer and his public has been his tendency to write about writing — to write poems about poems and fiction about novelists. Though such works vary widely in tone from defensiveness to a guilty deprecation of art itself, they all derive from the sense that the writer is different from people and that people resent him for it. He has often attempted to minimize that difference, as Poe did when he described the writing of "The Raven" as a purely rational process. Just as often he has allied himself with people against writers. It is a sure sense that impells a James Whitcomb Riley to attack poets in his verse and a Herman Wouk to make villains of artists and intellectuals. Melville, like Henry James in his short stories of the nineties, took the offensive, and, particularly in Pierre , made the embattled genius a hero and a martyr. This is the book which shut him off from any further serious consideration by contemporary critics, and the public's rejection of it was conclusive: it took Harpers 35 years to sell 1800 copies. Considering Melville's original intention in writing it, it was an incredibly blundering and perverse performance for a professional writer. His intention is plain: he conceived it as a market novel, based solidly on the formulas which mass fiction had been exploiting since the days of Mrs. Rowson, and which in Melville's time were the chief staple of Robert Bonner's mass story paper, the New York Ledger . Here is the plot: In idyllic country a rich, handsome, charming young squire woos Lucy, a rich, beautiful blonde, with the blessing of the boy's haughty, aristocratic, widowed mother. A melancholy brunette, Isabel, spoils it all by turning out to be the illegitimate daughter of Pierre's revered father. Immolating himself for the sin of his parent, Pierre jilts Lucy and takes Isabel under his protection in the simulated role of husband. Cast off by his mother, he takes Isabel to New York City. Living in abject poverty in a tenement, the pair are joined by Lucy and a ruined servant girl from home. The villain enters in the person of Pierre's rich, effeminate city cousin, Glen, who is to supplant him as heir. In a whirlwind finish, five characters die: Pierre murders his cousin and Lucy's avenging brother, and in prison he and Isabel commit suicide, as Lucy dies of heartbreak. Except for the unhappy ending, this is the stuff of mid-nineteenth century misery fiction and melodrama. Here also is the popular myth of the wholesome country vs. the wicked city, and of the permanent "ruin" suffered by the once-seduced girl. Occasionally Melville even lapses into the language of melodrama: "Her father will not look upon her; her mother she hath cursed her to her face," and Delly is "forever ruined by the cruel arts of Ned." This work he described to a publisher as a "regular romance, with a mysterious plot to it, and stirring passions at work." It would, moreover, be the first of a "new field of productions," which would enrich both him and his publishers. That he wished its popularity not to be damaged by association with his previous works is evident in his request that it be published anonymously. Poverty and debt had forced him into the mass market. But beneath — or above — this intention lay another. He was coming to believe that "the tribe of 'general readers'", (his words) who would not tolerate the unpleasant truth, could be deceived. The artist could be as profound as he wished without being resented if he concealed his profundities under a pleasant or sensational narrative surface through which the reader looking for mere diversion could not penetrate. Thus, greatness could be achieved in the public art of fiction in the nineteenth century, as it had been in Shakespeare's theater. The idea is hinted in Mardi , when Media, warning Babbalanja of the Abrazzas of the world, shuts off the philosopher's undisguised speculations on religion with the words, "Meditate as much as you will, but say little aloud, unless in a merry mythical way." He had practiced the merrily mythical in Moby Dick , with some success, if one may judge by reviews which admired the surface and nothing else. He brooded about how Shakespeare, beneath the surfaces of "popularizing noise and show of broad farce and blood-besmeared tragedy," "craftily" puts into the mouths of dark characters like Hamlet and Timon, "things which we feel to be so terrifically true, that it were all but madness" for any writer "in his own proper character, to utter, or even hint of them," and how this "madness of vital truth" is undetected by the public which burns its "tuns of rancid fat" at Shakespeare's shrine. In the summer of 1850 he discovered in Hawthorne the darkness and the depth of Shakespeare, and was convinced that his neighbor was not only, like Shakespeare, "almost utterly mistaken" by his readers, but that he deliberately courted misunderstanding in order to protect himself. Indeed, this genius "takes great delight in hoodwinking the world," partly by giving his dark stories innocent titles (like "Young Goodman Brown") which are "directly calculated to deceive — egregiously deceive, the superficial skimmer of pages." In 1851, when he was finishing Moby Dick and beginning Pierre , he had long talks of "things of this world and of the next, and books and publishers" with Hawthorne, who, for the first time, was reaching a large public with serious fiction. It was at this point that Melville deserted the adventure narrative and conceived a domestic thriller in which, under a surface of popular formulas, he would dive to greater depths than he had reached in Moby Dick . "Leviathan is not the biggest fish," he wrote as he began Pierre ; "I have heard of Krakens." The result of all this scheming was an out-and-out attempt to invest the sensational love novel with the dignity and profundity of Shakespearian tragedy. Pierre and Lucy are presented as agrarian aristocrats and are put at the top of American social pyramid in order to provide for the classic tragic "fall". The gaudy plot is a vehicle for profound psychological perceptions. The country boy-hero is as intellectual and introspective as Hamlet. The language and dialogue, a combination of Shakespeare and Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth of the Ledger , are elevated right out of the realm of recognizable English speech. And the plot, which a Ledger writer would have twisted into a happy ending at the last moment, is allowed to follow its natural course to a catastrophe which kills off the good and the bad alike. He puts into Pierre's mouth the "vital truth" which it would be "madness" for him to utter "in his own proper character," — but not "craftily" enough. The reviewers promptly identified Pierre with Melville and found him both mad and socially dangerous. Once more, the fault lay partly in Melville's bad handling of speculative commentary and of technical point of view. Much as readers either disliked or ignored the speculation in Moby Dick , he had tried to lead them gently into it — indeed to train them in speculation. In the chapter on "The Whiteness of the Whale", for example, his object was to get the reader to entertain the possibility — not the certainty — that behind the immensities of the universe there is a blank void of nothingness, of No-God, from which emanate terrors beyond our comprehension. Aware that a generation which had been taught to read by the Scotch rhetoricians tended toward stock responses to images, he worked patiently to complicate these responses without destroying them. After a long list of the accepted benign associations of whiteness, he tried to lead the reader, example by example, to the realization that white is also the symbol of terror, and that therefore malignity and benignity are inseparably one. The climactic paragraph, in which the appalling proposition is put, is not assertion but question. The reader is told not that evil is absolute, but that if we grasp imaginatively all the associations of whiteness, then we are in a position to understand a madman's "fiery hunt" for the source of evil. But we are also warned that he who sees nothing but the "colorless, all-color of a-theism" is a "wretched infidel" who "gazes himself blind." Again and again, in this chapter, Melville begs the reader to concentrate and to collaborate with him. "Let us try," he says at one point," for without imagination no man can follow another into these halls." Note the community between writer and reader that is implied or invited by the us and by the use of "another" (man) instead of the divisive pronoun "me." This sense of community is wholly lacking in the speculations in Pierre . No collaboration is invited, and the reader gets no guidance toward possibility. Properly guided, he might, perhaps, have understood that Pierre's progress toward disbelief in virtue (which is the theme of the book) is a necessity of his character not of Melville's; that what was necessity for Pierre was possibility for Melville; that the denouement does not prove that Melville thinks Pierre is right — only that the possibility of a man's thinking like Pierre constitutes the "tragedy of mind." We recall that, in the denouement of Moby Dick , a regenerated, believing Ishmael survives not only ship-wreck but his own speculative thinking. Much of Melville's blundering in Pierre may have been due to his having radically reconceived and rewritten it during the course of composition. On January 8, 1852 he wrote Mrs. Hawthorne, "I shall not again send you a bowl of salt water. The next chalice I shall commend, will be a rural bowl of milk." On Feb. 20 he signed a contract with Harpers for a book of about 360 pages. On April 16 he wrote his English publisher that his book could be about 150 pages longer than the one he had first proposed. In the finished book, the first five-eighths (to Chapter 16) is rural; the rest is urban. Nothing in the rural part prepares us for the revelation in Chapter 17 that the country youth is a popular author deeply involved in the literary commerce of the big city; in fact, Melville belligerently concludes a lame apology for this surprise by saying, "At any rate, I write precisely as I please." This is only one of the many places where Melville is an intrusive nuisance, who talks over his hero's shoulder or patently puts his own thinking, with which his critics had long been familiar, into Pierre's head. In revision, then, Melville added a story of authorship, which ends in defeat, to a tragedy of morals. The denouements of both are artificially — almost comically — synchronized. I conjecture that, finding his initial plot inadequate to motivate the catastrophic change in Pierre's moral thinking — from complete innocence to a knowledge of evil, — Melville arranged for him to find himself and clarify his problem by writing a book. This was a mistake. For not only is the hero a writer, an intellectual, and a full-blown example of the "misunderstood Genius," as cordially detested by the public then as he is now, but the public, as readers and publishers, become villains who crucify the Genius. Even in the rural story Melville as narrator had gone out of his way to excoriate the popular novel and those who read it; to accuse the world of "unforgiveable affronts and insults" to poets like Dante; of missing the "deeper meanings" of Shakespeare. Now, with the sufferings of Pierre as author to spur him on, he accuses his readers of judging literature as they do morals, of praising an author's worst books, or liking his best ones for the wrong reasons; and pictures the publishers who serve them as thievish illiterates. In short, "though the world worship Mediocrity and Commonplace, yet hath it fire and sword for all contemporary Grandeur." And the future will be worse, for authors will be as "scarce as alchymists" and the "mass of humanity reduced to one level of dotage." The world repaid Melville in kind for these compliments, and his reputation never recovered from the attack on Pierre . One would expect this to have been the climax of Melville's quarrel, but it was not. He continued as professional author for seven more years — to 1859 — chiefly as an anonymous magazinist. Ironically enough, it was in magazines that he practiced most successfully the deceptions he had intended in Pierre . In two books and fifteen magazine pieces he did some of the darkest and bitterest writing of his life. But he had learned his lesson, as he explicitly admitted when he submitted Israel Potter for serialization: in apparent capitulation, he promised the editor that it would contain "very little reflective writing; nothing weighty." He continued, in other works, to be reflective and weighty, but his thinking is so solidly embodied in situation, or so well disguised in the dialogue of deceptively cheerful or dull-witted or eccentric characters that it cannot often be imputed to him. Occasionally the old embattled Melville rises to the surface. Even Israel Potter , in its ironical dedication to the Bunker Hill Monument, contains some thinly covered bitterness about fame in America. And in "The Encantadas" he has the enemy in mind when he declares that he omits two crucial episodes from the widow's story because "I will not file this thing for scoffing souls to quote. . . . In nature, as in law, it may be libelous to speak some truths." But on the whole he masks his rejections of public values and slogans so skillfully that, although twelve out of fifteen of his magazine pieces deal essentially and unsentimentally with some kind of loss, poverty, loneliness, or defeat, some of the blackest of these were praised as "quaint," "fanciful," "lifelike," "genial," and "thoroughly magazinish." His most impudent piece of deception was a takeoff on the popular "sunshine-and-shadow" theme. "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo" appeared in Harper's Magazine , which its founder had dedicated to "the plain people . . . not philosophers and poets." The narrator in this story is cured of a case of the "doleful dumps" by the inspirational crowing of a distant rooster. Tracing the bird to a miserable hovel, he finds its owner, his wife, and their three children cheerfully and optimistically dying of sickness and starvation. The rooster then crows itself to death in an ecstasy of "affirmation". Today this piece would not fool even a Life magazine editorial writer, but a contemporary reviewer called it "lively and animated." Yet, if I interpret correctly one of Melville's most enigmatic stories, he had finally come to terms with himself as a writer, in his time, and in America. "The Fiddler" (1853) is a parable about genius, reputation, and fame. In Harper's , where it appeared, it seemed to harmonize comfortably with popular middle-class writings, like G. W. Curtis's Prue and I , which deprecate ambition and celebrate simple contentment. The fiddler, Hautboy, is a former English prodigy, who, at the age of twelve, had received the homage of the crowd on the London stage. For reasons not given, he had resigned from his status as genius, and now, at forty, he is an American who teaches fiddling for a living, walks Broadway "happy as a king" — and "no man knows him." The narrator, Helmstone, is a poet, whose classical tragedy has been attacked by the press. At the circus, watching the crowd's enjoyment of the clowns, he thinks bitterly of the rebuff he would get if he were to read to such people one of his "sublime passages." So far, analogies with Melville's career, past and future, are obvious. His serious work, too, had been attacked, and he also was to resign and to walk Broadway unknown until his death. But we hear a new note when, at the circus, the poet is struck by the genius's innocent delight in the clowns, and his capacity to share simple pleasures with the crowd. Hautboy's "honest cheeriness disdained my disdain. My intolerant pride was rebuked." The fiddler is again at one with the crowd when, at home, he plays "Yankee Doodle" and other common tunes. Yet the listening poet is "transfixed by something miraculously superior in the style," and his "whole splenetic soul capitulated to the magic fiddle," to the "bow of [this] enchanter." And as he plays, the fiddler has a "divine and immortal air, like that of some forever youthful god of Greece." When a third character tells the persecuted poet that "neglected merit, genius ignored, or impotent presumption" are all much the same thing, we come close to the meaning of the story. I take this to be that no writer can know whether his productions are the stuff of immortality, or rubbish. What is durable is not the Epic — the Big Job — in itself; this can fail precisely because it attempts something beyond mortal achievement. But style, which is the expression of character, is immortal. And the real fruit of genius is not the epic it attempts but the character which genius achieves while creating. Hautboy's reward lies in his mature capacity for life itself. His good sense and good humor enable him "intuitively to hit the exact line between enthusiasm and apathy," "to see the world pretty much as it [is]." Yet "he did not theoretically espouse its bright side nor its dark side. Rejecting all solutions, he but acknowledged facts. What was sad in the world he did not superficially gainsay; what was glad in it he did not cynically slur; and all which was to him personally enjoyable, he gratefully took to his heart." Can we say that this version of genius and this truce with the insensitive public was the final settlement of Melville's long quarrel with readers? One never knows with him. "The Fiddler" seems to anticipate the studied resignation in "Billy Budd," which he did not publish. The conclusion of his career in print was logically perfect: two volumes of verse privately printed, in editions of twenty-five copies each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Read before the English Institute on 3 September 1957. 1 That four of his most popular books are slightly fictionalized autobiographical travel rather than novels makes his case the more significant; for it is precisely in this borderland between forms of fact (that is, travel, history, and the literal representation of manners) and forms of fiction, that the American novel became a respectable literary genre (respectable, that is, in the eyes of the cultivated contemporary reader) during the first sixty years of its existence. 2 Chapt. 43. Melville reports this not as a "modest young man," but as an observer with a touristic and anthropological interest in the "heathenish games and dances which still secretly lingered in the valley." He watches from a hiding place, and the girls are guarded by "hideous old crones who might have been duennas." Rather perversely, however, he points up the sexual symbolism of the dance by recording that it was with difficulty that he restrained his companion from "rushing [out of the bushes] and seizing a partner." The dance was at first a part of the manuscript of Typee , from which he excluded it because, possibly, in that context it would have been more personal than in Omoo . Melville to John Murray, Jan. 29, 1847: "You will perceive that there is a chapter in the book which describes a dance in the valley of Tamai. This description has been modified and adapted from a certain chapter which it was thought best to exclude from Typee ." 3 Chapter 3. The whole chapter is an elaborate exposition of his social status and identity in relation to the character of the common sailor. 4 See a representative comment by Melville's friend, E. A. Duyckinck: In Moby Dick (which Duyckinck greatly admired) Melville's "extravagant daring speculation is out of place and uncomfortable," and it violates "the most sacred associations of life." 5 Compare the autobiographical passage in Pierre , where the publishers write the young author, "Sir: — You are a swindler. Upon the pretense of writing a popular novel for us, you have been receiving cash advances from us, while passing through our press the sheets of a blasphemous rhapsody, filched from the vile Atheists, Lucian and Voltaire." Bk. XXVI, Sec. IV. 6 This was now Melville's view of his earlier works. In explaining to John Murray why he changed Mardi from a continuation of Omoo to a work of fancy, he said, "Well: proceeding in my narrative of facts I began to feel an incurable distaste for the same; &amp; . . . felt irked, cramped &amp; fettered by plodding along with dull common places . . ." Mar. 25, 1848. 7 See his comment less than a month after it appeared: ". . . my mood has so changed, that I dread to look into it, &amp; have purposely abstained from so doing since I thanked God it was off my hands." April 5, 1849. If one accepts Pierre's writing of his magnum opus as analogous to the writing of Mardi , the second paragraph of Bk. XXI, Sec. I in Pierre suggests that Melville had some regrets about having loaded Mardi with undigested reading. 8 A unique exception deserves to be remembered: ". . . other parts [of Mardi ] require a wide-awake application, or, as in "Gulliver's Travels," one half the aroma will be lost. . . . the book invites study, and deserves . . . close investigation." The Albion , April 21, 1849. 9 Nothing in Typee and Omoo , and nothing in all the documents printed in Jay Leyda's Melville Log suggests that Melville thought about his writing in terms of genius, or in anything but commercial terms, before Jan. 1, 1848. But in March 25 of the same year he wrote the famous letter to Murray announcing the newly conceived Mardi . Thereafter, the concept of genius pervades his writings and his correspondence with Hawthorne.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Bibliography and the Novelistic Fallacy by Bruce Harkness</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a critic intent upon analysis and interpretation, must be in want of a good text. 1 It is also universally acknowledged that we live in an age of criticism, indeed of "new criticism"—which means that we as critics are dedicated to a very close reading of the text. Sometimes, it is true, that critical principle leads to abuses. The symbol-hunting, the ambiguity-spinning become wonders to behold. As one objector has put it, "nose to nose, the critic confronts writer and, astonished, discovers himself." 2 Nonetheless, the principle of close reading is held central by us all. Immediately that one contemplates novel criticism, however, an oddity appears: the last thing we find in a discussion by a new critic is some analysis of the actual text. The modern critic is apt to be entirely indifferent to the textual problems of a novel. He is all too prone to examine rigorously a faulty text. As Gordon Ray and others have pointed out, even the Great Cham of British Criticism errs in this respect. F. R. Leavis defends the early Henry James in The Great Tradition : "Let me insist, then, at once, . . . that his [James's] 'first attempt at a novel,' Roderick Hudson (1874), in spite of its reputation, is a very distinguished book that deserves permanent currency—much more so than many novels passing as classics." Professor Ray adds that "Mr. Leavis goes on to quote three long paragraphs to illustrate the novel's 'sustained maturity of theme and treatment. . . .' These remarks are amply warranted by the passage that Mr. Leavis cites. But unhappily he has quoted, not the text of the first edition of 1877 [while carefully dating it from the time of composition to make it appear all the more precocious], which is simple enough, but that of the New york edition of 1907, revised in James's intricate later manner. This leaves him," concludes Leavis's critic, "in the position of having proved at length what nobody would think of denying, that James's writing at the age of sixty-four has all the characteristics of maturity." 3 Unhappily, few of us can afford to laugh at the poor new critic. We all know the truth that we must have a good text, but most of us do not act upon it. A commonplace? Yes, and unfortunately, I have only that commonplace to urge; but I claim good company. Jane Austen, with whom I started, recognized that Pride and Prejudice had no profoundly new meaning. She ironically developed upon commonplaces: don't act on first impressions; don't interfere in your best friend's love affair; don't ignore your younger daughters. My point is that, ironically, everyone ignores the bibliographical study of the novel. People who would consider it terribly bad form to slight the textual study of a play or poem—or even doggerel—commit bibliographical nonsense when handed a novel. It seems that the novel just doesn't count. A key error in many studies of the novel is simply this, that the novel is unconsciously considered a different order of thing from poetry—a poem's text must be approached seriously. I shall illustrate by mentioning the sins of editors, reprinters, publishers, scholars, and, alas, bibliographers. Then, after discussing a few of the many reasons for this bibliographical heresy, I shall turn to my main illustration of the need for textual bibliography, The Great Gatsby .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II A list of representative errors, by no means exhaustive, by sound men whom I admire in all other respects will make clear how faulty the texts of novels are, and how little we care. A good editor has put The Nigger of the "Narcissus" in The Portable Conrad , an excellent volume the introductions to which contain some of the best Conrad criticism. But what, one may wonder, is the copy-text for The Nigger ? A search through the book discloses two references, the less vague of which reads as follows: "It is from the editions published and copyrighted by the latter [Doubleday and Company] that the texts reproduced in this volume have been drawn" (p. 758). After a spot of searching the reader can discover for himself that the copy-text for The Nigger of the "Narcissus" is not the collected English edition, which as is well known was Conrad's major concern. The copy-text was an early American publication, which Conrad habitually did not supervize. The new critic immediately asks, does it make any difference? The collected English edition was, as one might suspect with an author who was constantly revising, changed in many ways. This final version cuts down Conrad's intrusive "philosophizing," and corrects Donkin's cockney accent, among other shifts. 4 I yield to no man in my admiration for Conrad, but if he has a fault, it lies in that adjectival "philosophy" which is admired by some, charitably overlooked by others, and condemned by a few as pipe-sucking old seadog-talk. Surely the following, from the early part of Chapter Four, is inappropriate in the mouth of the sailor-narrator: "Through the perfect wisdom of its grace [the sea's] they [seamen] are not permitted to meditate at ease upon the complicated and acrid savour of existence, lest they should remember and, perchance, regret the reward of a cup of inspiring bitterness, tasted so often, and so often withdrawn before their stiffening but reluctant lips. They must without pause justify their lief. . . ." Most of this passage, and much similar sententiousness, were cut by Conrad from the collected English text; but they all stand in The Portable Conrad . As for the class of books known loosely as "reprints," I suppose that no one expects a good text for twenty-five or thirty-five cents. These books I am not concerned with, but the more serious paperbacks, obviously intended for use in colleges, are sometimes faulty. For example, Rinehart Editions' copy of Pride and Prejudice reprints Chapman's excellent text—but suppresses the indication of three volume construction by numbering the chapters serially throughout. 5 Though three volumes are mentioned in the introduction, this misprinting of such a tightly constructed novel can only be regretted, for the effect on the college reader must be odd. What of the publisher of more expensive novels? It can easily be seen that errors are not limited to the paperback field. Consider, for example, the one-volume Scribner edition of James's The Wings of the Dove , dated 1945 or 1946. Here is no scrimping for paperback costs, but the book is not what one would think. It is not a reprint of the famous New York edition; it is another, unacknowledged impression of the 1902 first American edition, dressed up with a new-set New York preface—an odd procedure the reason for which is not apparent. The publisher nowhere tells the reader that this is like some wines—an old text with a new preface. Yet one line of print would have made the matter clear. It is only by his own efforts of collation of the preface and the text itself that the reader knows where he is. 6 To turn to the errors of scholarship, take F. O. Matthiessen's lengthy appreciation of Melville's phrase "soiled fish of the sea" in White Jacket . Melville's narrator says of himself, after he had fallen into the sea, "I wondered whether I was yet dead or still dying. But of a sudden some fashionless form brushed my side—some inert, soiled fish of the sea; the thrill of being alive again tingled. . . ." This section Matthiessen acclaims as being imagery of the "sort that was to become peculiarly Melville's . . . hardly anyone but Melville could have created the shudder that results from calling this frightening vagueness some ' soiled fish of the sea'!" Then follows a discussion of the metaphysical conceit and its moral and psychological implications. As has been pointed out, the genius in this shuddering case of imagery is not Melville, who wrote coiled fish, not soiled fish. "Coiled fish" stands in the first editions of White Jacket , and to an unknown Constable printer should go the laurels for soiling the page with a typographical error. 7 Matthiessen's error does not concern me now, but it does concern me that the scholar who first caught the mistake has a strange but perhaps understandable attitude toward textual matters. Recognizing that such an error "in the proper context" might have promulgated a "false conception," the scholar feels that the slip does not actually matter in Melville's case. Furthermore, he feels that Matthiessen's position is essentially sound — he was merely the victim of "an unlucky error." While sympathizing with common sense and professional etiquette, one may still wonder, however, how many such slips in illustration are allowable. Could the critic, if challenged, produce as many sound illustrations as one would like? Does not Matthiessen, in his categorizing of conceits, virtually admit that this particular kind is rare in White Jacket ? When we look at the texts of novels from the other way, how many good editions of novelists do we have? How do they compare with the poets? We know a good bit about the bibliographies of Scott, Trollope, Meredith, but those of Dickens, Thackeray, Conrad, Hawthorne, and many more are completely out of date. 8 How many collected editions can be put on the same shelf with Chapman's 1923 Jane Austen? "We have virtually no edited texts of Victorian novelists," says Mrs. Tillotson in the introduction of Novels of the Eighteen-Forties (1954). How slowly we move, if at all. Take Hardy for example. In 1946 Carl Weber said that "many scholars have apparently made no attempt to gain access to Hardy's definitive texts." In March, 1957, a scholar can complain that "As late as November 1956, sixty full years after the publication of the book, the only edition of Jude printed in the United States took no account of either of the two revisions which Hardy gave the novel. . . . The New Harper's Modern Classics edition . . . [however] is almost identical with that of the definitive 1912 'Wessex Edition.'" 9 One is hardly surprised that Professor Weber is the editor. Sixty years is a long time, but American literature is no better off. Moby-Dick , our greatest novel, presents no problem of copy-text. Yet more than 100 years went by after publication before we had what a recent scholar called the "first serious reprint," by Hendricks House. Before that, the careful reader did not even know, for example, the punctuation of the famous "Know ye, now, Bulkington?" passage. But how good is this reprint? The same scholar — not the editor — asks us to consider it a definitive edition. His reasons? It contains only 108 compositor's errors and twenty silent emendations. 10 Would anyone make such a claim for a volume of poems? So much for editors, publishers, scholars. The sins of the bibliographer are mainly those of omission. For well-known reasons he tends to slight 19th- and 20th-century books in general, and in consequence most novels. 11 The critic therefore needs convincing that novels should be approached bibliographically. The critic appreciates the sullied-solid-sallied argument about Shakespeare, but not that of 108 typos for Moby-Dick . A false word in a sonnet may change a fifth of its meaning; the punctuation at the end of the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" can be considered crucial to the meaning of the whole poem; but who, the critic argues from bulk, can stand the prospect of collating 700 pages of Dickens to find a few dozen misplaced commas? Like the "soiled fish" reading of White Jacket , a few mistakes seriously damage neither novel nor criticism. They are swallowed up in the vast bulk of the novel, which by and large (and excepting a few well-known oddities such as Tender is the Night in which case one must be sure which text one is attacking) is decently printed and generally trustworthy. The critic feels that a mistake here or there in the text is immaterial. "It doesn't really alter my interpretation," is the standard phrase. This attitude has long since been defeated by bibliographers for all genres except the novel. One wonders indeed, if the critic would be willing to make his plea more logical. Could not the attitude be extended to some formula for trustworthiness versus error? It ought not to be difficult to arrive at a proportion expressing the number of errors per page, exceeding which a novel could be condemned as poorly printed. Amid bad reasoning, there is some truth to the critic's defence against bibliography. The argument can be shifted from the ground of a novel's size and a reader's energy to the aesthetic nature of the novel. The critic is certainly right in maintaining that novels are more loosely constructed, even the best of them, than poems or short stories. The effects of a novel are built through countless small touches, and the loss of one or two — whether by error in text or inattention in reading — is immaterial. Putting aside the counter claim that this truth is damaging to the critical and crucial premise of close reading, surely all is a matter of degree. And what is more, the theory applies mainly to character portrayal. If we fail to recognize Collins as a fawning ass on one page, we will certainly see him aright on another. That much must be granted the critic. In other concerns, however, the novel may not be repetitive. To give just one illustration: F. Scott Fitzgerald's Last Tycoon as published in unfinished form contains a boy whom the reader should compare to the "villain" of the piece, Brady (or Bradogue as he was called in an earlier draft). In Fitzgerald's directions to himself left in his MSS, he says "Dan [the boy] bears, in some form of speech, a faint resemblance to Bradogue. This must be subtly done and not look too much like a parable or moral lesson, still the impression must be conveyed, but be careful to convey it once and not rub it in. If the reader misses it, let it go — don't repeat." 12 My last and painful reason why virtually no one is concerned with the texts of novels is this: most bibliographers are also university teachers and many of them suffer from schizophrenia. I do not refer to that familiar disease which makes us scholars by day and diaper washers by night, but that split in the man between Graduate Seminar number 520 in Bibliography and Freshman "Intro. to Fic.," 109. How many of us make bibliographical truths part of our daily lives or attempt to inspire our graduate students so to do? In this respect many bibliographers are like socialists and Christians: walking arguments for the weakness of the cause. Let me give one or two illustrations from experience. Not very long ago I sat in a staff meeting while we worried over a sentence of Conrad's introduction to Victory in the Modern Library edition. The sentence contained the odd phrase "adaptable cloth," used about mankind. It made no sense until it was finally pointed out that "adap-table" was divided at the end of the line in both American collected edition and reprint — a domestically minded compositor was talking about a table cloth, while Conrad was saying that Man is "wonderfully adaptable both by his power of endurance and in his capacity for detachment." And our silly discussion had gone on despite long teaching, and one's natural suspicion of the cheaper reprints that perforce must be used in college classes. More seriously, consider Dickens' Great Expectations , taught to freshmen at many universities, by staffs composed of men nearly all of whom have been required to "take" bibliography. Yet how many of these teachers have turned to the facts of serial publication to explain the figure of Orlick, extremely puzzling by critical standards alone? One immediately sees that Orlick's attack on Mrs. Joe, which ultimately causes her death, is used by Dickens to pep up a three instalment sequence the main purpose of which is simply to let Pip age. This sequence would have been too dull, too insistent on domestic scenes round the hearth while Pip gradually withdraws from Joe, were it not for the Orlick subplot. 13 The novel apparently had to have thirty-six weekly units, and Dickens therefore could not simply skip this period of Pip's life. The figure of Orlick may not be critically acceptable, but he is at least understandable when one views him in the light of publishing history. I am also indicting myself for not understanding this point; for it was not many months ago that I looked up the weekly issues of All the Year Round and now have far more detail than, as the saying goes, "the short space of this article will permit the discussion of." I was derelict in my duty partly because life is short and bibliography is long, but also partly because I unconsciously resented the editor of my paperback Great Expectations whose job I was having to do. For I am more familiar with the schizophrenia than most people, though mine takes a different form. With critics I am apt to claim to be a bibliographer; among bibliographers, I proclaim myself a critic. The critic, one must recognize, can argue on aesthetic grounds against working on the texts of novels. He can produce the tu quoque argument. And he can say that the bibliographer neglects what he is working on. Of 244 articles on textual bibliography in the Studies in Bibliography list for 1954, only three were related tonovels. 14 "What has the bibliographer been doing?" asks the new critic. It may be that under the aspect of eternity George Sandys' Ovid is more important than Conrad's Nostromo or Melville's Moby-Dick , but it would be hard to convince the novel critic of that.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III For these reasons I have chosen F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby as my main illustration. It brings out nearly all my points: inconsistent editing, an unknown or unidentified text, a publisher who is good but vague, important errors in an important book, schizophrenia in the bibliographer-teacher. Not only is Gatsby a fine novel, but it is taught so often because it contains many of the basic themes of American literature: West versus East; the search for value; the American dream; crime and society; and in young Jim Gatz's "General Resolves," it even reaches back to Ben Franklin and Poor Richard. How many know, however, what they have been teaching? The Great Gatsby exists in print in three main versions: the first edition, beginning in April, 1925; a new edition in the volume with The Last Tycoon and certain stories, beginning in 1941; and a subedition of the latter text in the Modern Standard Authors series ( Three Novels ) together with Tender is the Night and The Last Tycoon , beginning in 1953. 15 Though Gatsby in the Three Novels version is another impression of The Last Tycoon plates I call it a sub-edition because Gatsby's position is different, coming first in the volume, and there are many changes in the text. 16 So far as I know, the only available information about the text of Gatsby is buried in the notes to Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise . Mizener says that Fitzgerald found a misprint in the first edition: the future Nick Carroway speaks of at the end of the novel should be "orgiastic," not "orgastic": 17 It was one of the few proof errors in the book [adds Mizener], perhaps because Scribner's worked harder over Gatsby than over Fitzgerald's earlier books, perhaps because [Ring] Lardner read the final proofs. The only other proof error Fitzgerald found was the reading of "eternal" for "external" on p.58 [of the first edition] . . . . Edmund Wilson's reprint in his edition of The Last Tycoon corrects all it could without access to Fitzgerald's personally corrected copy. 18 Let us couple these comments with Matthew Bruccoli's interesting article on Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise . Bruccoli is surprised that thirty-one errors are corrected in later impressions of the novel. He concludes that "the first printing was an inexcusably sloppy job," although Fitgzerald was himself in part responsible for the difficulty. We might infer two things, therefore: far fewer errors in Gatsby's first edition, and a correction of the word "eternal," in The Last Tycoon . Not so. The correction to "external" is not made in the second impression of the first edition, nor in any impression of Last Tycoon (202.2, TN 38.2). Though there are only four changes from the first to second impression of the first edition, there are no less than twenty-seven changes between First and Last Tycoon . Between First and the 1953 Three Novels , there are more than 125 changes. Of these changes about fifty are quite meaningless. They change "to-morrow" with a hyphen to "tomorrow," for example. Or they change "Beale Street Blues" to Beale Street Blues . This class of change will not be commented upon nor included in statistics, except to add that the publisher was not at all consistent in making such alterations. 19 There are, in other words, 75 changes of moment between the first edition and Three Novels —forty-four more than in This Side of Paradise . Many of them are more important. Of the changes the August, 1925, first edition brought, the most important was the substitution of the word "echolalia" for "chatter" in the phrase "the chatter of the garden" ( First 60 line 16). 20 But we must remember that Last Tycoon and Three Novels are both posthumous, and that of the twenty-seven changes from First to LT, twelve are clearly errors, seven are dubious improvements, and only eight are clearly better readings. Of them all, the word "orgiastic," apparently, alone has the author's authority. What's more, the subedition Three Novels retains all but two of these bad changes. An example of an error begun in LT and continued in TN occurs on page 209.6 of First (296.8 of LT and 132.8 of TN). The sentence of Nick's, "It just shows you." is dropped from the text, thereby making the punctuation wrong and leading the reader to confuse speakers. Between First and Three Novels the changes are of several kinds. In addition to the fifty or so "meaningless" changes, there are (a) fifteen changes of spelling, including six that change the meaning of a word and others that affect dialect; (b) seventeen changes in punctuation, including quotation marks, paragraph indication, and so on; (c) six incorrect omissions of a word or sentence or other details; (d) six proper deletions of a word or more; (e) thirty-one substantive changes —the substitution of a word or the addition of a phrase or sentence. For instance, Gatsby is transferred from the Sixteenth to the Seventh Infantry during the war. (See First 57.17, LT 201.12, TN 37.12.) For when we turn to Three Novels we must move out of the camp of strict bibliography into the field of its important ally, publishing history. Fitzgerald's own copy of the first impression, with pencilled notes in the margins, is now located at the Princeton University Library and was used to make the sub-edition. Of the seventy-five changes between First and TN , thirty-eight are with Fitzgerald's sanction and thirty-seven are without. Most of the thirty-seven changes not recommended by Fitzgerald are "corrections" made by a publisher's staff editor or by Malcom Cowley, who supervized the sub-edition. However, some of this group are clearly errors, many of them having crept into the text by way of the Last Tycoon version. The noteworthy thing is that no reader knows the authority for any of the changes. The sub-edition itself does not even announce that it takes into account Fitzgerald's marginal comments—which, one would have supposed, would have been good business as well as good scholarship. Furthermore, some of the thirty-eight "sanctioned" changes were only queried by Fitzgerald: no actual rewording was directed. An example is the phrase "lyric again in." Fitzgerald questioned "again" and the editor dropped it. But in five instances of Fitzgerald's questioning a word, no change was made—as, for example, Fitzgerald was unhappy to note that he had used the word "turbulent" twice in the first chapter. 21 There is also one instance in which Fitzgerald expressly asked for a change that was not made. At First , 50.1, Fitzgerald corrected "an amusement park" to "amusement parks," but the later version does not record the request (TN 32.32). On the whole, one can say this, therefore: that about sixty of the changes from First to Three Novels are proper. That is, they either have the author's authority or are stylistic or grammatical improvements or are immaterial. I speak just now as a devil's advocate — a critic with a jaundiced eye toward bibliography. He would call the deletion of a comma from a short compound sentence "immaterial," though it was not done by the author. 22 I am trying, in other words, to make the text sound as good as I can. Problems arise, however, from the fact that awkward readings sometimes come from purely typographical errors, sometimes from editor's decision, and sometimes from Fitzgerald's own notes. Everyone would accept such changes as "an Adam study" for "an Adam's study," ( First 110.26, LT 233.30, TN 69.30); but by the same token few critics will be pleased by a Fitzgerald marginal correction reading "common knowledge to the turgid sub or suppressed journalism of 1902," instead of "common property of the turgid journalism of 1902" ( First 120.11, TN 76.5). We are left then with fifteen or sixteen errors begun or continued in Three Novels , errors which I trust even the newest of new critics would accept as having some degree of importance. That degree of course varies. The dedication "Once again, to Zelda," is left off, for example. Dialetical words are falsely made standard English, or half-doctored-up, as in this sentence where the word in First was "appendicitus": "You'd of thought she had my appendicitis out" ( First 37.4, LT 188.37, TN 24.37). Sentences start without a capital 23 or end without a period 24 or are dropped altogether. 25 Quotation marks appear or disappear 26 and awkward readings come from nowhere. To illustrate that last: on page 149.10 of First Nick says that "the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away." The eyes are Myrtle Wilson's but in Three Novels 95.1 (and LT 259.1) the sentence is confused when "the" is added without any reference and "from" and "with peculiar intensity" are dropped: "the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment that the other eyes were regarding us less than twenty feet away" (italics added). Another dubious change is this: a joking slip or drunken mistake by Daisy is corrected — "Biloxi, Tennessee" becomes academically placed in its proper governmental locality. 27 One hardly needs to add that none of these changes have Fitzgerald's sanction. The biggest errors, critically speaking, are ones that also occur in Last Tycoon . The principle of order in The Great Gatsby is a simple one: Nick Carroway, the narrator, tells his story wildly out of chronological order, but in the order that he learned it — with one exception. 28 The first half of the book is concerned with the development of the outsiders' illusions about Jay Gatsby — he is "nephew to Von Hindenburg," and so on (TN 47). The second half is a penetration in depth of Gatsby's illusion itself. The shift in the theme of the book is marked by the one major sequence which Nick gives the reader out of the order in which he himself learned it. I refer to the Dan Cody episode from Gatsby's early days. 29 Now the most important structural unit in the book below the chapter is the intra-chapter break signified by a white space left on the page. 30 In Last Tycoon and Three Novels four of these important indications of structure are suppressed. 31 Oddly enough, it is the one following the Dan Cody story that is the first one missing. The detail that divides the book into its two structural elements is botched. In the Three Novels version of Gatsby , then, we have a book quite well printed — surprisingly so when we look at the galley proofs. They are filled with changes — with page after page added in long hand, with whole galleys deleted or rearranged. (I would estimate that one-fifth of the book was written after the galley stage.) And we have a book that tries to take into account the author's latest stylistic revisions. Unfortunately, it is also a book that has far too many errors. Perhaps this is the place to mention the third Scribner edition of Gatsby , the paperback Student's Edition, which uses TN as copy text. Have matters been improved? Some have, but more errors have been added. There are twelve changes from TN to SE: it makes two distinct improvements, including the replacement of the dedication; but it adds three places in which intra-chapter breaks are suppressed. 32 The other changes are "immaterial" typographical errors such as "turned to be," instead of "turned to me" (SE 71.17 and TN 54.20) and " police ," instead of "pol ice " (SE 27.27 and TN 22.19). I hope it is clear, then, that Three Novels represents the best present text of Gatsby . No doubt it and the Student's Edition will be the ones most used in colleges for some time. It should also be clear that in Three Novels , we have this kind of book: 1. A book which nowhere gives the reader the authority for seventy-five changes, all of them posthumously printed. 2. One which fails to make use of all of Fitzgerald's corrections. 3. One which contains thirty-seven changes which Fitzgerald did not authorize — some of which are of most dubious value. 4. A book which contains at least fifteen quite bad readings, one of which is of the highest structural importance. So, armed with this mixed blessing, or with the worse one of Last Tycoon , or worst of all, with a reprint by another publisher which has none of Fitzgerald's corrections and additions, many students unwittingly face the next semester with their prairie squints. Only a nonexistent, eclectic text, combining the best of the August, 1925 first edition and the Three Novels text of The Great Gatsby would be proper. 33 Could we not as critics pay more attention to Bibliography, and we as Bibliographers to criticism? Can not we somehow insist that editing actually be done — instead of the practice of putting a fancy introduction on a poor text? Can not we have sound texts reproduced and publisher's history stated by the editor? Can not we know what it is we have in our hands? For it is simply a fallacy that the novel does not count.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This article represents an expanded form of a paper read at the Bibliography Section of the 1957 Modern Language Association meetings. 2 Marvin Mudrick, "Conrad and the Terms of Modern Criticism," Hudson Review , VI (1954), 421. 3 Gordon N. Ray, "The Importance of Original Editions," in Nineteenth-Century English Books , by Gordon N. Ray, Carl Weber, and John Carter (1952), p. 22. See also "Henry James Reprints," TLS , Feb. 5, 1949, p. 96. 4 C. S. Evans of the editorial department of Heinemann wrote Conrad on 2 Sept., 1920, about Donkin's inconsistent dialect: "I have queried the spelling of 'Hymposed,'" and so on. (See Life and Letters [London: Heinemann, 1927], II, 247-248, for the exchange with Evans.) J. D. Gordon in Joseph Conrad: The Making of a Novelist (1940), p. 139, et passim, discusses many of the revisions of the text. It might be possible to defend the use of an early text for The Nigger , but no reason is given in The Portable Conrad . 5 Though I cannot pretend to have examined them all, I know of only one independently produced paperback novel with good textual apparatus. This is Rinehart Editions' Lord Jim , which contains a collation of the four main texts. Riverside's Pride and Prejudice has a good text, but again Chapman's edition lies behind it. There must be, I am sure, many more good texts beside Lord Jim in the higher class of paperbacks, and even in the cheaper ones. But what publishers draw them to our attention, and what publisher doesn't (apparently) feel that a properly edited paperback novel will frighten away the common reader by its appearance? 6 Furthermore, it would be difficult to defend the choice of first-edition text, as one might for The Nigger of the "Narcissus ," or Roderick Hudson , since James was writing in his intricate manner by 1902. 7 See J. W. Nichol, "Melville's 'Soiled Fish of the Sea,'" AL , XXI (1949), 338-339. 8 See John Carter, op. cit. , p. 53 et passim; reasons for the lack of bibliographical study are also discussed. 9 Robert C. Slack, "The Text of Hardy's Jude the Obscure ," N-CF , XI (1957), 275. Italics added. 10 William T. Hutchinson, "A Definitive Edition of Moby-Dick ," AL , XXV (1954), 472-478. 11 See Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), p. 356 ff, for a discussion of these reasons on the part of the bibliographer. One should admit, furthermore, that the non-professional bibliographers, the scholarly readers and editors, may have reasons which are indefensible, but are nevertheless reasons . I daresay one would be shocked to know how many trained men feel today that novels aren't really "literature"; or that modern printing is either perfect or too complicated ever to be fathomed. 12 F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Last Tycoon , in Three Novels (1953), p. 157. Italics added. 13 See instalments 8, 9, 10 (Chapters XII and XIII, XIV and XV, XVI and XVII). The Pip-Magwitch strand is early developed as much as can be without giving away the plot. Pip loves Estella early, but is apprenticed back to Joe by the beginning of chapter XIII. The glad tidings of Great Expectations don's come until instalment 11. Without Orlick, more than four chapters would have to deal with domestic bliss and withdrawal. Orlick is introduced and attacks Mrs. Joe, all in the ninth instalment. At the other end of the book a similar situation obtains. The reconciliation with Miss Havisham comes in instalment 30; that with Joe is brief enough not to be needed until after instalment 33. Estella is not brought in until the end. Instalments 31, 32, 33 are needed, therefore, to make the 36 weekly unit structure complete—but they cannot all contain the secret plan to get Magwitch down stream. The reader cannot go boating with Pip, Startop, and Herbert for two entire instalments before the disastrous attempt to get Magwitch out of the country; so instalment 32 is devoted to Orlick's attempt to kill Pip. In other words, serial publication took Dickens to melodrama, but not quite in the crude form that one's unsubstantiated suspicions would indicate. 14 There are, it is encouraging to note, signs of change. In the last year or two, one has the feeling that perhaps six or eight articles appeared on the texts of 19th- or 20th-century novels. For example, see Linton Massey, "Notes on the Unrevised Galleys of Faulkner's Sanctuary ," SB , VIII (1956), 195-208 or Matthew J. Bruccoli, "A Collation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise ," SB , IX (1957), 263-265. The latter article is especially interesting in pointing out changes between impressions of editions. Having mentioned Dickens, I must add that Mrs. Tillotson has followed up her remark ( op. cit. ) that we have no Victorian texts, and "no means, short of doing the work ourselves, of discovering how (and why) the original edition differed from the text we read." I refer of course to John Butt and Kathleen Tillotson, Dickens at Work (1957); on the importance of part publication, it deals mainly with novels other than Great Expectations . While it also illustrates how long it takes for a general appreciation of the importance of bibliographical facts to culminate in a specific study, the book makes my comments on Dickens, so to speak, unspeakable. 15 The first edition has had three impressions: April, 1925, August, 1925, and August, 1942. I have collated three copies of the first impression, including Fitzgerald's personally corrected volume now located at Princeton. The August, 1942 impression I have not examined. I would like to record here my special thanks to Lawrence D. Stewart of Beverly Hills, California, for most kindly checking my collation against his copy of the rare second impression. The second edition of Gatsby is that printed with The Last Tycoon and certain stories, as supervized by Edmund Wilson It uses as copy-text the August, 1925 first edition. I have collated three impressions, 1941, 1945, 1948. The sub-edition of Gatsby , as printed with Tender is the Night and The Last Tycoon , in the Three Novels volume, has been collated in three impressions, 1953, 1956, 1957. The parent company, Scribner's, has permitted several reprints, which I have not examined thoroughly. There is also a recent (1957), third edition of Gatsby , by Scribner's, a paperback, called "Student's Edition." I shall refer to these editions of Gatsby by the short but obvious forms of First, Last Tycoon or LT, Three Novels or TN, Student's Edition or SE. For convenience I shall give the line in a page reference by a simple decimal; as TN 31.30, for Three Novels , p. 31, line 30. 16 My thanks are due to Princeton University Library for permitting me to examine both Fitzgerald's own copy of Gatsby and the surviving manuscripts. Doubtless I should add that since my special concern is the printed texts, I did not rigorously collate the mass of MS, TS, and galleys. I would like also to thank Wallace O. Meyer of Scribner's, Harold Ober, Edmund Wilson, Malcolm Cowley, and Dan C. Piper for their advice and for patiently answering my queries about the changes in the texts. 17 The comment is a trifle misleading, because the reading "orgastic" stands in MS, galleys, and first edition. Perhaps this is another example of Fitzgerald's well-known weakness in matters of spelling, grammar, and so on; at any rate, it can hardly be called a "proof error." 18 Arthur Mizener, The Far Side of Paradise (1951), p. 336, n. 22. Mizener points up the generally sad fate of Fitzgerald's texts by mentioning that the reprints of The Modern Library, New Directions, Bantam (first version), and Grosset and Dunlop all have the word "orgastic." One therefore assumes they reprint the first edition, though at least the Modern Library reprints the second impression. The later Bantam edition and The Portable Fitzgerald both use the faulty Last Tycoon as copy-text. 19 See, for example, the word "today," in LT, p. 280 line 36 and TN, p. 116 line 36; but "to-day" (as in First , p. 184 lines 7 and 10) is kept three lines later—LT p. 281.1, TN p. 117.1. In addition to forty-two such changes, there are six more which are nearly as minor: the word "sombre" is changed to "somber"; "armistice" to "Armistice," as examples. All these, and the change in the spelling of a name (Wolfshiem to Wolfsheim) which was usually but not always wrong in the first edition, are not included in my statistics. 20 See LT 203.4 and TN 39.4. The other changes in the August, 1925 First are as follows: April, 1925 it's driver p.165.16 August 1925 its driver April some distance away p.165.29 August some distance away. April sick in tired p.205. 9 &amp; 10 August sickantired All four are, presumably, authorial. 21 See "lyric again in," First 62.17, LT 204.12. "lyric in," TN 40.12. Cf. "turbulent," First 20.17, LT 178.25, TN 14.25; "turbulence," First 7.28, LT 171.3, TN 7.3 22 See First , 35.21: Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature. . . . LT 188.7 and TN 24.7 remove the comma. 23 First 111.14 and LT 234.5 When I try . . . TN 70.6 when I try . . . 24 First 115.25 generating on the air. So LT 236.33. TN 72.33 generating on the air 25 The sentence "It just shows you," mentioned above as an error begun in LT. 26 First 141.6, LT. 253.38, TN 89.38. Tom Buchanan is speaking and by closing a paragraph with quote marks, LT and TN give the reader the momentary impression that the next sentence and paragraph beginning "Come outside . . ." is by someone else. First 139.26, LT 253.7, TN 89.7 represent the obverse. "The bles-sed pre-cious. . . spoken by Daisy loses the quotation mark in LT and TN. 27 See First 153.8, LT 261.14, TN 97.14. TN alone reads "Biloxi, Mississippi." I realize that the line can be interpreted in other ways, that for example, Fitzgerald wished an obviously fictional town. But I cannot agree that Fitzgerald was so ignorant of Southern geography as to put the city in the wrong state. I am all the more certain that Fitzgerald meant it as a joke because there is other geographical wordplay in the same scene, and it is only four pages earlier that Tom snorts that Gatsby must have been an Oxford man—"Oxford, New Mexico." 28 The statement is not quite accurate: there are one or two other violations of this order, minor ones very late in the book. For example, the giving of Michaelis's testimony, p. 124 of TN is apparently after the scene on pp. 119 ff. 29 The scene was, in the manuscript, at the place where it is referred to in the chapter now numbered VIII, pp. 112 of TN. Fitzgerald then changed it to its present position, ending at TN 76, LT 241, First 121—Chapter VI. 30 Since I have mentioned Conrad so often, it might not be amiss to add Conrad's name to the list of influences mentioned by Cowley in the introduction to Three Novels . (See Fitzgerald's introduction to the Modern Library Gatsby and The Crack-Up for his interest in Conrad.) The time scheme of Gatsby is, of course, Conradian, as well as the narrator. And there are quite a few passages that echo Conrad—the closing section on the old Dutch sailors' feelings in New York might be a twist on parts of "Heart of Darkness." "In the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men," p. 4 of TN's Gatsby , is just one of the verbal echoes of Conrad. More pertinently, the intra-chapter break was a device very much used by the older author. For a detailed examination of this relationship, see R. W. Stallman, "Conrad and The Great Gatsby ," TCL , I (1955), 5-12. 31 See First 121.26, LT 240 foot, TN 76 foot; First 163.26, LT 267 foot, TN 103 foot; First 192.16, LT 285 foot, TN 121 foot; First 214.21, LT 299.21, TN 135.21. In all but the last of these the break in the page comes at the turn-over of the page and, unfortunately, no space was left for it. 32 For the suppressed intra-chapter breaks, see TN 126.31 and SE 167.26; TN 132.24 and SE 175.19; TN 136.24 and SE 181.7. The other improvement is at TN 89.7 and SE 117.3, where SE returns to First to get the quotation marks of "The bles-sed . . ." as spoken by Daisy, correctly once more. SE 175.1 does not restore Nick's sentence "It just shows you." but it does "correct" the quotation marks that were wrong in the preceding sentence in TN 132.9. 33 I should add that the collation of these three editions has of course not been reproduced in full here — and there are several places in the text that call for emendation though there are no changes between editions. For example, Tom brings the car to a dusty spot under Wilson's sign. (So in First 147 and TN 93.23 and SE 123.7). Should it be a dusty stop?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Compositor B's Role in The Merchant of Venice Q2 (1619) by D. F. McKenzie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We can be reasonably certain that Q2 Merchant of Venice (1619) was set from Q1 (1600) by Jaggard's compositor B, 1 so that in this instance, with certain reservations, we know to a large extent what copy B was given to set and what he did with it. We must of course know a lot more of B than his handling of printed copy in 1619, but the following analysis, limited as it is, may be thought to offer some useful intermediate information about his working practices. The total number of variants introduced into Q2 is something like 3,200. Whether all of these are in fact compositorial is not easy to determine. Some apparently new readings may derive from variant forms in the copy of Q1 used by B but no longer extant (IV.i.73 and V.i.300 are sufficient warning of this danger). Similarly, it may even be that a Q2 proof-reader introduced some variants and removed others, although there is no evidence of this. But we meet by far the greatest difficulty in deciding whether any of the new readings are the work of an independent reviser. Clearly no reviser is going to worry much about the accidentals of the copy. Most features of presentation certainly, spellings almost certainly, and punctuation very probably, were the compositor's concern. From an examination of Q2's expansions and contractions of Q1 forms, of elisions and of changes in line-division, I am sure that these too must be attributed to the compositor. A few of the truly substantive alterations may be revisional, but again, apart from changes in stage directions and speech prefix forms, very few of these changes are beyond the compositor; many of them are inexplicable as the deliberate emendations of a reviser. In fact, as we shall see, it is neither difficult nor unreasonable to attribute all the so-called revisions in the text itself to compositor B. I consider first the changes in substantive readings and then the changes in the accidentals of spelling, punctuation, and so on. Substantive alterations: Since they appear to have all the characteristics of planned rather than impromptu editing, I shall assume that substantive changes in stage directions and speech prefix forms were not made by compositor B. For the rest, the variant readings fall easily into several groups: literal errors made or corrected; the omission, addition or substitution of single letters; and the omission, addition, transposition or substitution of words or phrases. Of the 134 changes made under these headings, 11 represent literal errors (foul case and so on) and 7 represent the correction of literal errors in Q1. We are therefore left with 116 effective changes or about one to every 23 lines — and this in the most straightforward copy imaginable. Chambers, Wilson, Greg and Brown have assumed that most of these had already been made in the copy supplied to B. Admittedly this is a remote possibility but on the evidence I believe it to be unlikely. On the other hand this group of changes does for the most part show the same combination of misdirected ingenuity, deliberate tampering and plain carelessness which Miss Walker has elsewhere found in the work of B. To establish the probability that most of these changes were B's would require examination of every one in context. For reasons of space alone this is obviously impossible and I hope instead by selective quotation to suggest both the kinds of changes made and the likelihood that they were compositorial. Changes considered later as simple contractions or expansions are not duplicated in this section. It seems fairly certain that B took upon himself the minor job of deleting, adding or changing a single letter, especially final - s , when he thought it might improve the grammar or the sense. To take some examples: (a) Omissions: 1. I.iii.70 Me-thought (s) you said, you neither lend nor borrow 2. IV.i.65 I am not bound to please thee with my answere (s) 3. V.i.114 We haue bin praying for our husband (s) health (b) Additions: 4. III.i.6 if my gossip (s) report be an honest woman of her word 5. III.iv.50 render this / Into my Cosin (s) hands 6. IV.i.349 If it be proued against an (y) alien 7. V.i.32 For happy wedlock (es) houres (c) Substitutions: 8. I.i.95 O my Anthonio , I do know of those [Q1 these] 9. II.v.30 And the vile squeaking of the wry-neckt Fife [Q1 squealing] 10. II.vi.58 [to Gratiano and Salarino] on gentlemen, away [Q1 gentleman] 11. II.viii.39 Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio [Q1 slumber] The variants under these headings actually number 27, made up of 11 omissions, 12 additions and 4 substitutions. Only 5 of these changes are accepted by the editor of the New Arden edition, and all 5 could easily have been compositorial. We certainly cannot assume that Slubber , for example, because it is not now in current use, would not present itself to B in 1619 as a most elementary correction. Many of the changes, although they might be considered conscious corrections, may in fact be memorial errors or just slips of the eye (this could be the explanation for I.ii.47 and III.i.40 below) but many others I believe do show an often wrong-headed emendation for grammar and a weak sort of sense. When we ask, as we must, why any reviser should have made most of the changes in the next group — words omitted, added or transposed — we again find ourselves at a loss for any reasonable explanation. These changes number 49, made up of 20 omissions (including one whole line), 16 additions and 13 transpositions. Again, taking omissions and additions first, some examples will best show what B was about: (a) Omissions: Prose 1. I.ii.35 J but one who (you) shall rightly loue 2. I.ii.47 J that he can shoo (him) himselfe 3. III.i.40 I say my daughter is my flesh and (my) blood Verse 4. III.ii.82 Some (marke) of vertue on his outward parts 5. IV.i.400 To bring thee to the gallowes, not (to) the Font 6. V.i.305 That I were couching with the (Doctors) Clarke (b) Additions: Prose 7. I.ii.140 J with so good (a) heart 8. II.v.9 J was wont to tell me, (that) I could 9. III.i.92 J (O) / would shee were hearst 10. III.i.113 J (in) one / night Verse 11. II.ii.186 I haue (a) sute to you. / You haue obtain'd it 12. IV.i.346 Ile stay no longer (heere in) question. / Tarry Iew 13. IV.i.423 Not as (a) fee: grant me two things I pray you The first two examples betray elementary confusions of which only a very careless reviser would have been guilty, and 3, like 5, 7 and 11, shows the sort of unconscious normalisation which it is reasonable to expect of a compositor. It is very likely that 9 and 10 illustrate the way in which B might alter the copy for his own ends. In each of these lines the word added comes at or near the end and in neither case could the first word of the next line be fitted in or conveniently broken: it would seem that B was here justifying his line by addition. Again then we have the familiar mixture of accidental changes (4 and 6), probably unconscious normalisations and deliberate emendations. The New Arden editor accepts 2 of Q2's omissions and 2 of the additions — 4 changes out of 36 — but none needs a reviser's hand. Excluding one that occurs in a stage direction, there are 4 instances of transpositions in prose and 9 of transpositions in verse. There is little point in quoting the prose examples. Two of them, one also involving an omission, quite obviously must be attributed to a momentary mental blindness on B's part, and the other two, although they give a slightly more natural reading, are more likely to represent unconscious normalisation than deliberate emendation either by B or a reviser. The 9 verse transpositions also point strongly to corruption, probably unconscious, by B. I quote four to illustrate: 1. I.i.24 Q2 What harme a winde too great at sea, might do Q1 what harme a winde too great might doe at sea 2. IV.i.434 Q2 There's more then this depends vpon the valew Q1 There's more depends on this then on the valew 3. V.i.65 Q2 Doth grossely close in it, we cannot heare it Q1 dooth grosly close it in, we cannot heare it 4. V.i.213 Q2 And suffer'd him to go away displeased Q1 and sufferd him to goe displeased away None of Q1's readings is at all awkward either in expression or sense and again it is difficult to imagine a reviser changing them. Two of the transpositions moreover completely destroy the meaning (2 and 3). Of the 40 remaining substantive changes, 36 represent the substitution of single words and 4 of phrases. Some of them are clearly compositorial: for and if (twice) for and, a for of, of (twice) and on for a , and equall for egall. Others, being obviously wrong, are most unlikely to be those of a reviser regularising the text: Hath for Haue (in "virgins of our clime / Hath. . ." at II.i.11) and That for till (at V.i.305). Others again are less clearly but certainly wrong, and since they are unnecessary and stylistically bad they are not easily explained as the wilful alterations of a reviser: although for albeit , the for this (twice), and foole for food . Others are more difficult to attribute. Eight could reasonably be compositorial: com-/mand for commaundement at II.ii.32 is not unusual and the business of justification would have come in the middle of setting the word; range (III.ii.113) may be a variant of reigne or reine and Q1's ambiguous raine ; it may be doubted whether roofe for rough (III.ii.206) is merely a spelling variant, but in any case it is an obvious correction; the for her (I.i.33), one for man (I.i.78), his for the (III.iii.29), presently for instantly (IV.i.281) and And for hee (IV.i.339) are hardly beyond the compositor and could even be accounted for as memorial errors; ill for well (II.ii.21 J), conclusions for confusions (II.ii.39) and their for the (II.ix.81) introduce difficulties which even a reasonably intelligent reviser would have wished to avoid. Even out-stare for ore-stare (II.i.27), while it may be revisional, could also be a variety of foul-case error. There are 5 readings which, it could be maintained, may be truly revisional: incarnall for incarnation (II.ii.27 J); fledg'd for flidge (III.i.31 J); To view for I view (III.ii.62); then for it (III.v.82); tis for as (IV.i.100). However, the very smallness of the group seems a strong argument against a reviser, and in any case it is a little uncharitable to give a reviser credit for these few near-misses and blame B for the obvious wides. But these changes at least, even if misguided, may be thought sufficiently important and plausible to justify a reviser's hand. Finally among the single words altered there is a small group of substitutions which are difficult to account for as deliberate alterations but which could be unconscious changes: misery for cruelty may have been suggested by the abundance of words at that point containing an s (III.iv.21); cutst for tak'st (IV.i.326) is probably a recollection since cut occurs in the preceding line; health for welfare (in "We haue bin praying for our husband health" — V.i.114) makes the line run a little more easily and could represent revision; apparreld for accoutered (III.iv.63) and far'st for cherst (III.v.75) remain inexplicable unless we treat them simply as unconscious changes. The four instances of phrase substitution are: are you resolu'd for is hee yet possest (I.iii.65) and he would haue for ye would (I.iii.66) which, since they occur together and are out of character with most other compositorial changes, may suggest an attempt, altogether unnecessary, to clear up the sense; at the length for in the ende (II.ii.83 J — although justification in this case could not have been a factor); and did vphold for had held vp (V.i.214). This tinker-tailor fashion of allocating changes to B and the inevitable uncertainty about the presence of a reviser make it difficult to be authoritative about B's accuracy. Still it is even harder to be authoritative about his work in a text where the underlying copy remains largely subject for speculation, and it may be taken as an indication of the value of Miss Walker's work that her general conclusions about B are substantially confirmed by this examination of Q2 Merchant of Venice . If most of the changes discussed are B's then it is indeed a matter for grave concern that a compositor who was responsible for setting so much of the First Folio should have some significant error every 23 lines. Over all his work, B's average may not be so high as this, though with heavier copy the number of outright mistakes and of easy solutions to difficult readings might well be expected to rise. Some of B's readings may of course be accepted as desirable and so correct, but the main point is not whether one reading in 11 or 12 happened to be acceptable, but whether it was B's intention faithfully to follow his copy or deliberately to depart from it in order to give what he considered to be a better reading. The evidence from Q2 Merchant suggests more strongly than ever that he was not only subject to numerous lapses even when trying to follow copy but that he might also correct it on no one's authority but his own. Alterations in accidentals: In what follows I shall, with one or two minor exceptions, consider only the changes made by B against his copy. There is of course an obvious objection to this procedure, namely that important preferences happening to coincide with the copy itself might be overlooked, but it is the only safe way of isolating copy influence and so of arriving at what are therefore perhaps B's more positive preferences. As will be seen, the changes made cover a wide range and while some are naturally more significant than others, all are to a greater or less degree relevant to discussion of the nature of the copy used for F1 plays and to the question of B's consistency and accuracy. Here then I want to consider B's handling of spelling, punctuation, capitalization, stage directions, speech prefixes, typographical abbreviations and proper nouns, his use of italics, and his attitudes to justification, line division, syncope and elision, expansions and contractions and to versification generally. The spelling changes introduced into Q2 by compositor B offer the most important evidence for his identification in other plays. Some changes are regularly made, many betray great inconsistency, but in either case of course the changes are significant. Besides knowing those spellings habitually used by B against his copy we must also know those to which he was apparently indifferent. One of the most important features of Q2 is the mixture of A and B preference spellings. It is clear that compositor A could not have been working on this text and yet there are in fact 64 A spellings (17.3 per cent of the total) of words normally used to test B's presence in the Folio. To take some of the more significant spellings: do 103 to doe 11; go 41 to goe 16; heere 62 to here 15; yong 12 to young 13. These figures give us some idea of the measure of inconsistency we might expect in the earlier work of B. Even more significant as an indication of the instability of B's preferences are the A spellings which he gave against the B forms of Q1. There are 13 A forms which could not have derived from the copy and which are most unlikely to have been affected by justification. These are goe 1, chuse 2, deare 3, and here 7. Compositor B then might once in 10 or 11 times put doe under copy influence or to justify a line, but he never once set it against his copy; his preference for go must be considered much less stable than that for do , and he might even occasionally set goe against his copy; chuse and deare are perhaps not so significant as the numbers involved are not large; here however B gave 7 times in unjustified lines and against his copy, so that this word might not be an altogether reliable test for B's presence. Young is also worth mention, for although B never goes against his copy to give an A spelling (unless justification intervenes) he actually set the A form on 13 of the 25 occasions on which the word occurs. Some other comments on B's spelling are worth making. He seemed to prefer, for example, to hyphenate words like bed-fellow, me-thinks (and me-thought ), selfe-same and under-valewed rather than not, and in fact hyphenated such words 25 times whereas he deleted the hyphen in only 9 words. On 15 occasions words divided in Q1 were given by B as one word, and on 10 occasions he made the reverse change. It is quite clear from the changes made that many a Prethee of Shakespeare's is in fact compositor B's, for he 6 times substituted this word for Q1's Pray thee . The evidence of these changes taken together with that of hyphenation suggests a tendency on B's part to contract word forms. Although sometimes the alterations are unimportant the preference for contracted or compound forms can upset verse lines and may possibly and even more seriously provide us with a non-Shakespearian element in low comedy scenes where the temptation to use them would be greater. Another fairly pronounced characteristic of B's spelling is his substitution of medial - i - for medial - y -, although this change is not consistently made. We find forfeitures and forfeyture, said and sayes on the same pages together with similar variants retained from Q1. However B had a three to one preference for the - i - form; he substituted it for - y - 94 times and made the reverse change only 30 times. Moreover many of the changes to - y - concern the same words: lye 5, dye 2, gyrle 3, fayle 2, sayle 2. A far more consistent alteration was that of au or ou plus nasal to a or o , although almost half the changes relate to the one word Lancelet and although he sometimes followed Q1's au or ou (cf. young ). However this change was made 96 times in all. Justification may have been a factor on 32 occasions, but the complete absence of any change to au or ou suggests that B's preference was fairly well established. The use of final - y for - ie is almost though not quite absolute. B gave - ie for - y 12 times (4 times in verie and 4 times in the not quite comparable monies ) but he gave - y for - ie 110 times. Among the words most frequently changed are deny, Lady, twenty, mercy . Again, however, B often kept Q1's - ie forms, giving a mixture of forms not only on the same pages but within the same lines. Only 2 of the - ie substitutions occur in justified lines. Far less significant is B's use of single for double consonants or vice versa . He chose to set double consonants 80 times and single 77, the number of possibly justified spellings in each group being 21. Most of the variants are insignificant but B did prefer the - esse ending to Q1's frequent - es in nouns ( happinesse, heauinesse, businesse , etc) and he also seemed to prefer a single consonant in the third person singular present indicative of verbs ending in - l ( tels, cals, fals and, perhaps by analogy, wals ). Compositor B contracted Q1's double vowels to single vowels 104 times and extended them 56 times, but except in a few words ( too , given 10 times against copy, lose 7, doing 3, bene 9), the changes were usually haphazard. Again justification probably dictated many (23 words given double vowels and 40 given single ones occur in full prose lines), but the proportion of words affected is about the same in each group. B's treatment of the pronouns he, she, we, me was variable but he preferred the shorter forms (47 as against 19). Although generally speaking B also preferred to drop the final - e from many words (he did this 368 times) he also added it to a large number (215), and again we frequently find the same word treated in different ways. Some words however are far more often given without the - e than with it and vice versa . There are of course do and go , but also anon, Iew, indeed, forfet, need, wee'l ; with the single exception of goe a final - e is not once added to these words against the copy. Words to which it was fairly frequently added are backe, finde, olde, quicke, thanke, thicke, thinke, trickes, waste, wilde and winde ; however beside the 7 occurrences of thinke we have to place one think , given against the copy but in a justified line, and beside the 6 occurrences of thanke we must place one thank , given against the copy in an unjustified line. Apart from these few words there seems to be little governing principle behind B's choices. Although he made 583 changes of this kind, his frequent inconsistency shows that he was quite indifferent to the spelling of many of the words he altered. The last major group of spelling variants is that composed of words which do not fall within any of the preceding categories. While some of these words may suggest broader preferences (for example, the substitution of - cke for - que ), most of them recur too infrequently to justify further classification. There are 301 variants in this group, the words which appear most frequently being diuell 11, heart 22, master 30, mistris 5, musicke 15, shew-shewes-shewing 10, then (for Q1's than ) 8. Many of these preferences were no doubt shared by compositors A and E so that their significance as test words may be slight. Nevertheless we still need to know with some certainty the sort of things B was doing to his copy even when we have determined his presence. In the long run of course it is the only reason for determining his presence at all. A short note is all that is possible about B's changes to the punctuation of Q1. Many of them are haphazard but a large number show deliberate normalisation. There are some 715 changes altogether. The addition of 347 commas makes up by far the largest single group. By contrast, only 23 commas were deleted. Some of the more important classes of additions are those which occur with the vocative and exclamations, with relative clauses, participial clauses, various kinds of adverbial clauses, prepositional phrases, parenthetical statements and phrases, and between the protasis and apodosis of conditional sentences. These are places in which we might expect to find commas, but there are other classes important enough to justify comment. For example, B frequently marked off the subject, either a noun or a noun equivalent, with a comma ("If to do, were as easie as to know what were good to do. . ." at I.ii.13). He would also often add a comma before an infinitive although many of these occur at the end of verse lines and may simply mark the end of line pause ("And these assume but valours excrement,/ To render them redoubted. . ." at III.ii.87-8). And a comma is frequently inserted before a noun clause or to mark the ellipsis of that after verbs of saying or wishing. Of the commas added to verse lines, 113 come within the line and 186 at the end. There are of course many other changes in punctuation. As we should expect, most of them give heavier pointing but there are numerous exceptions. The figures may be of interest: a comma was replaced by a semicolon 34 times, by a colon 28, by a full point 32, by a question mark 29, by an exclamation mark once; a semicolon was replaced by a comma 10 times, by a colon 9, by a full point 15; a colon was replaced by a comma 14 times, by a semicolon 28, by a full point 30, by a question mark 5; a full point was never reduced to a semicolon but it was replaced by a comma 8 times, by a colon 6, by a question mark 19, by an exclamation mark once (two full points were accidentally omitted at the ends of speeches and two necessary ones inserted); a question mark was replaced by a comma 5 times, by a semicolon once, by a colon 3 times, and by a full point 53 (one question mark was added and another deleted). B capitalized the word following a mid-line colon 5 times when it was not capitalized in Q1 and he reduced such capitals in Q1 4 times, although some of these changes were doubtless independent of punctuation. A capital follows a comma twice, a semicolon 3 times, and a question mark 7 where Q1 gives lower-case letters. Finally, B added parentheses 6 times, omitted them once, and correctly repositioned a misplaced bracket. Of all the relevant changes, 102 resulted in lighter punctuation and 538 in heavier. Such an analysis of punctuation changes shows the need for much freer treatment of Folio punctuation generally (did compositor A set many other commas like that in Macbeth II.ii.64 — "Making the Greene one, Red."?) It may eventually be possible to see some system in B's capitalization, but any attempt to impose a classification on the limited number of examples provided by Q2 is predestined to failure — there are too many exceptions. Of the 253 changes made (apart from those required by repunctuation or the substitution of upper- for lower-case letters at the beginning of verse lines), 193 represent words capitalized and 60 represent words reduced to lower case. Words capitalized by B against his copy more than twice are: Casket 10, Conscience 3, Ducats 3, Gentlemen 3, Grace 5, Iudge 3, Law 8, Letter 10, Loue 3, Mistresse 3, Mother 3, Moone 4, Musicke 4, Ring 26, and State 3. Yet we must beware of concluding that B's preference for some of these forms was necessarily a very strong one, for he also gave iudge 5, and mistris 1. A similar inconsistency is seen with ile 3 and Ile 2. More significant perhaps are father 10, although Father also occurs once, master 11, sonne (i.e. son ) 3, and summer 2 together with winter 1. It has been claimed that B, in the Folio at least, regularly centred his entry directions. However of the 46 entries in Q2, only 29 are centred with some care and the remainder are roughly centred. There are moreover 4 pages on which one entry is carefully centred and another not. These figures, and in particular the variant positioning of entries on the same pages, would seem to indicate a measure of indifference on B's part. Compositor B apparently also had a preference, though again not a hard and fast one, for setting exit directions full out to the right-hand margin. Of the 41 exits in Q2, 35 are set in this manner and only 6 are indented. Again in two cases indented and non-indented forms appear on the same page. Apart from entries and exits there are only 5 other directions in Q2. The first of these is set full out ( Hee reads . — not in Q1); the second is indented ( He opens the Letter . — Q1 open the letter . indented); and the third is carefully centred ( Musicke playes . — Q1 play Musique . set to right). Of the 2 remaining directions, one ( Iessica aboue . — really an entrance — after II.vi.25) is carefully centred, as in Q1, and the other (after III.ii.62) is centred to the page, again as in Q1, but not to the verse measure. With regard to speech prefixes there are two main points to be considered: whether compositor B abbreviated or expanded the speech prefixes of his copy and whether in either case his changes were made for the sake of uniformity. I assume that substantive changes in these forms may be revisional. Excluding omissions and insertions, B altered the speech prefixes of his copy 230 times (48 times in justified lines). Of these changes, 17 were confined to spelling only and did not affect the length of the prefix. Of the remaining 213 changes, however, 162 resulted in abbreviation of the copy-text form and 51 in expansion of it. Compositor B must therefore be considered to have had a pronounced preference for the shorter forms. The preference is in fact stronger than would appear for the Salanio and Salarino prefixes had to be expanded to at least the fifth letter, Solanio being deleted altogether from Q2. Other expansions, like that of An. to Ant. , Bas. to Bass. , Ies. to Iess. , Clo. and Clown. to Clown. , seem to have been made from a desire for some degree of uniformity. Compositor B's practice in expanding or abbreviating and, Master , Lord and so on was, as we might expect, variable. He abbreviated and to &amp; 8 times and expanded &amp; to and 6 times and to If once. In 9 of these changes justification could have been a factor. He twice abbreviated Maister to M. and twice expanded L. to Lord . The evidence is insufficient to justify generalisation. Compositor B invariably italicised all entries, exits and directions, even though 25 of Q1's directions were partly in roman. Usually, though far from invariably, he also italicised mythological names. He changed Q1's roman to italics 4 times and Q1's italics to roman 3. The use of italics for countries, towns or their inhabitants, and adjectives derived from them, suggests a more fixed preference. In 3 instances B went against Q1 to set such forms in italics, and although he sometimes followed Q1's roman he never departed from Q1's italics. Characters' names when they appear in the text were normally italicised by B although he did twice put such names in roman against Q1's italics. Similar words italicised against his copy are Mounsier, Abram, Daniel, Barrabas and Faucenbridge . Finally, B consistently italicised quotations, letters and so on. There is little point in discussing the spelling changes introduced by B into the characters' names, but there are several other proper nouns whose spelling differs from that of Q1. Cressed becomes Cressada against both Q1 and the metre (F1 keeps Cressed , but the form in Troilus is usually Cressida or Cressid ), Caribdis becomes Charibdis (but Cholchos is altered to Colchos ), Daniel is 6 times spelt with a single - l , Fauconbridge is changed to Faucenbridge, Franckford to Frankford, Fraunce of course is normalised to France, Genowa on 3 occasions becomes Genoway, Germanie is altered to Germany, Italie to Italy, Nazarit to Nazarite, Neopolitane to Neapolitane, Palentine to Palatine, Romaine to Romane and Venecian to Venetian . Although we really have no means of telling when words were altered to justify a line, I have throughout treated full prose lines as if they had in fact been deliberately justified by spelling. To treat all full lines as suspect is the only way of isolating possibly justified words. On this basis, I have counted the spelling changes and other alterations in a number of groups where justification could have been a factor. Omitting instances which overlap, we find that shorter forms are given 269 times and longer (including the insertion of apostrophes in elided words) 96 times. That is to say, B normally justified by deletion, in keeping with his general preference for shorter word forms. Four of B's additions to the text and 5 of his omissions occur in justified lines. Q1's verse lineation was changed 10 times in Q2. One of these changes (at I.i.6) is insignificant since the division is in effect only a turn-under. More significant is the fact that this particular line ("I am to learne: &amp; such a want-wit sadnes makes/of me,") is really a line and a half, but the extra half-line goes unnoticed and apart from breaking it at "makes" instead of "sadnes" Q2 keeps Q1's arrangement. Twice Q1's division is corrected (at II.v.53 and II.vi.45) but in the remaining 7 instances it is wrongly changed. Q1's lineation is indicated by the bar: 1. II.vi.1-2 This is the pent-house vnder which Lorenzo / desir'd vs to make stand. 2. II.vi.45-7 So are you sweete, Euen in the louely garnish of a boy, But come at once,/for the close night Doth play the run-away, 3. III.v.87-9 for the poore rude world Hath not her fellow. Lor. Euen such a husband / hast thou of me, As she is for wife. 4. IV.i.6-9 I haue heard, Your Grace hath tane great paines To qualifie / his rigorous course: But since he stands obdurate, 5. V.i.1 The Moone shines bright. In such a night as this, / 6. V.i.112-13 He knowes me as the blinde man knowes The Cucko, / by the bad voyce. There seems to be little reason for the incorrect division in 1 (the verse measure would have taken Lorenzo ) except that our analysis of punctuation changes shows that B preferred a pronounced pause at the end of a line, and the pause in this instance may have seemed to him more natural at which than at Lorenzo . In 2, B correctly divided line 45, but failed to recognise the half-line in 46 and so misdivided 47. The greater attraction of hast to husband than of As to me , combined with B's preference for a pause at the end of the line (given by his new arrangement), is probably responsible for the change in 3, and a similar explanation may apply to the incorrect division found in 4. The analysis of punctuation changes showed that B frequently inserted a comma before an infinitive, so that possibly here he divided line 7 to achieve the same effect, and this of course affected the division of line 8. In 5 the division would appear to have been made simply to give uniformity with the arrangement of Jessica's and Lorenzo's succeeding speeches which for metrical reasons had to be set as in Q1. The most likely explanation for the final change is that the Cucko would not fit B's verse measure, and since he could not end the line on the he carried both words over. Had he mistaken the verse for prose, as the New Shakespeare editors suggest, it is unlikely that he would have capitalized The. Disregarding I.i.6 then, B redivided the verse lines of his copy 9 times, twice correctly but 7 times wrongly. The explanations for these 7 errors are necessarily conjectural but it would seem that two influences could have been at work —B's desire for uniformity and his preference for a reasonably strong pause at the end of a line. There has in the past been a great deal of discussion about the extent to which elisions found in Folio texts were Shakespearian or compositorial, and the uncertainty led to further disputation about the quality of elided vowels. It is safe to say however that compositor B, at least in Q2 Merchant , did sometimes elide and sometimes expand the forms in his copy, and that the marking of elisions by an apostrophe had nothing to do with pronunciation. For the most part B's treatment of elision in past participles or the third person singular present indicative simply amounted to the insertion of an apostrophe. Altogether he altered Q1's forms 101 times, but only 17 of the changes represent expansion of Q1 elisions, and of the 84 contracted forms only 20 involve actual changes in the spelling (apart from those where the whole word is altered). Among the participles, B substituted -' d for Q1's - d 58 times; for - t or-' t 4 times; for - ed twice. He replaced - ed by -' de once and by - d 3 times. He only once gave - t for -' d. He also gave entred for enterd, engendered for engendred and, by mistake no doubt, ser'ud for serud . On the other hand, B expanded Q1's -' d or - d to - ed 10 times and to - de 5 times. Among the remaining verb forms, B once gave - st for -' st , but made the reverse change 4 times; and he once expanded - st to - est but twice elided- est to -' st . He also altered call'dst to cald'st and threatenst to threatnest . Compositor B's effective contractions of other words (the contractions that is which reduce the number of syllables) total 25 (19 of them occurring in verse lines), and his expansions 18 (9 occurring in verse lines). A further 56 changes simply involve the insertion or omission of an apostrophe. Where B altered Q1's youle or weele , he usually put you'l and wee'l ; normally he set an apostrophe in here's, that's and there's ; on the other hand, he twice omitted an apostrophe given in Q1 to mark the elision of e in a superlative. Some words however B actually altered and these are much more serious. I have already mentioned prethee which was 6 times substituted for pray thee , but we also find ifaith for in faith, farwell or farewell for far(e) you well, ist for is it, on't for of it, Let's for Let vs, ha for haue, Ime for I am, my for mine before a consonant, to for vnto and y'are for you are . Among the expansions are in the for ith, say it for say't, vnto for to and uppon for on . Nowhere did B use the forms to'th, to'th', by'th', they'are and so on against his copy, although he did insert an apostrophe in th'interiour, t'intrap and th'afternoone . Finally, B's handling of verse requires special attention, the main point being whether he tried deliberately to improve the metre. First, as we have just remarked, one of the most significant things about B's punctuation was his insertion of 186 commas at the end of verse lines and of 113 within verse lines, indicating a preference for a strong pause at the end of a line. Some though by no means all of his mid-line insertions coincide with the caesura, but there is little to suggest a special attempt to alter the metrical structure. Second, with regard to verse re-lined by B, we should remember that his alteration of Q1's verse lineation resulted in only 2 corrections but 7 errors. But more important than either his new punctuation or line-division is his addition or deletion of syllables in verse lines. In brief, B lengthened the verse lines of his copy 22 times and shortened them 33. Of these changes, one resulted in a line of 8 syllables, 18 in lines of 9, 13 in lines of 10, 16 in lines of 11, and 7 in lines of 12. Only 4 changes could possibly be considered corrections. It is certain that none of B's changes was made with an eye to, or rather an ear for, the metre. The detailed study of compositors' working practices, bleak by-way though it seemed at first, has now become one of the main highways to Shakespeare's text. But the journey is far from over yet. We also need to know a great deal more about their social and educational background as well as their apprenticeship training. Naturally, the less certain we are of the nature of the copy-text for any play, the less able we are accurately to assess the compositor's role in giving us the printed version. That is why the patient analysis of reprints, where the compositor or compositors can be positively identified and the copy is not seriously disputed, offers the surest method of determining the nature of compositorial corruption. What holds for printed copy may not hold for manuscript, and a compositor's preferences might change. These however are suppositions which I hope others will demonstrate from similar and comparative analyses of other plays.

      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (IV) by Cyrus Hoy *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fletcher's collaborations with Field, together with two of his unaided plays that have undergone revision, will be dealt with in this section of the present study. The collaborations with Field are four in number. The series of Four Plays, or Moral Representations, in One is the joint work of the two dramatists. The Knight of Malta and The Queen of Corinth represent a tripartite collaboration between Fletcher, Field, and Massinger. In The Honest Man's Fortune we have, I think, a play that is basically Field's own work, but in which he was assisted in individual scenes of single acts by Massinger and Fletcher. Fletcher's comedy of The Night Walker was, as we know from the Office-Book of Sir Henry Herbert, revised by James Shirley in the 1630's; this external evidence for Shirley's revision is corroborated, as will be seen, by the internal linguistic evidence which the first quarto text of the play affords. The comedy of Wit Without Money would seem to furnish a parallel case of non-authorial revision of a Fletcherian original. Here, however, there is no external evidence for revision, and the internal evidence can only be supplied negatively, as it were, from the well-nigh complete absence of the Fletcherian ye from the substantive quarto edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I It will be necessary at the outset to examine the linguistic forms that are present in Field's two unaided plays: A Woman is a Weathercocke (published in quarto in 1612) and its companion piece, Amends for Ladies (quarto 1618). 1 's ye y' d'ee t'ee w'ee hath doth 'em them i'th' o'th' his ha' WW 22 1 14 1 2 11 18 27 18 7 2 * 1 9 AL 15 1 11 2 30 11 24 26 4 5 2 The linguistic pattern that emerges from these plays contrasts in a number of ways with the patterns of linguistic usage that have been found to be representative of the unaided work of Fletcher and Massinger. In neither of Field's plays does the occurrence of ye approach the Fletcherian usage; at the same time, his fairly steady though never frequent use of the form stands in contrast to the practice of Massinger, who tends to avoid the use of ye altogether. The very steadiness of its occurrence in the plays of Field contrasts with what we have observed of the practice of Beaumont. 2 Whereas there is nothing to distinguish Field's use of hath from its occurrence in the unaided plays of Massinger, his practice contrasts sufficiently well with that of Fletcher, who employs it no more than 6 times in a single play. Field's use of doth contrasts sharply with the practice of both his principal collaborators; as has been previously shown, the form occurs but thrice in a single one of the unaided plays of Fletcher, and its occurrence is almost equally negligible in the unaided work of Massinger, where it is found but 5 times in three plays. 3 Field's use of the contractions 'em, i'th', o'th' , and 's for his is indistinguishable from Fletcher's; but since, as has been shown, these are forms that Massinger rarely or never employs at the period of his collaborations with Fletcher and others, the practice of Field, like that of Fletcher, contrasts with the Massingerian one on this score. 4 The contraction ha' for have has been previously encountered chiefly in the work of Beaumont; 5 it does not occur in the unaided plays of Massinger, and is found but four times in three of Fletcher's unaided plays. 6 The contraction 'ee never occurs in isolation in Field's work, but always appears in combination with the preceding auxiliary do (contracted to d' ), or the preceding prepositions to and with (contracted to t' and w' respectively). The form is clearly a feature of Field's linguistic pattern, and it is unfortunate for its worth as authorial evidence for his work that it is a feature of a number of other linguistic patterns as well. The contractions d'ee and w'ee occur in Shirley, as will be seen elsewhere in this section of the present study; and in a later section of this study, both forms together with t'ee will be found to occur frequently in the plays of Ford. Contractions in 'ee are found in three of the plays associated with Beaumont: in the 1613 quarto text of The Knight of the Burning Pestle (where it occurs once as d'ee , thrice as t'ee ); in the 1647 folio text of The Noble Gentleman (once, as d'ee ); and in the Lambarde manuscript text of Beggars' Bush (once as to'ee , once as keep'ee , once as ask'ee ). And while the contraction does not occur in any form in the unaided plays of either Fletcher or Massinger, it appears in a number of Fletcher-Massinger collaborations: in the 1647 folio text of The Custom of the Country (5 times as d'ee ); in the 1637 quarto text of The Elder Brother (once as would 'ee , once as t'ee ); in the 1647 folio text of The Sea Voyage (5 times as d'ee , twice as t'ee ); in the 1647 folio text of The Spanish Curate (once, as undertake 'ee ). These sporadic occurrences of the 'ee contraction in the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations are with one exception (the would 'ee of The Elder Brother ) found in scenes marked with the Fletcherian ye . There are some equally sporadic occurrences of the form (or variants of it, for it appears to have undergone sundry mutations in the folio texts) in The Knight of Malta, The Queen of Corinth, Four Plays in One, and The Honest Man's Fortune . To regard certain at least of these occurrences of 'ee as evidence of Field's work is permissible only if one is willing to grant significance to the fact that with one possible exception (V, 4 of The Honest Man's Fortune ), the form occurs, not in the scenes where ye is found flourishing in full Fletcherian abundance, but in those scenes in which the use of ye approximates the moderate practice of Field in his two unaided comedies. This serves to point up the truth that there is no single linguistic form that can in itself be regarded as distinctive of Field's work; such evidence as is available for his share in a collaborated play must be based on the prevalence of the total linguistic pattern that characterizes his unaided work as we know it, and not on the single language forms of which the pattern is comprised. The totality of Field's language preferences, considered as a linguistic pattern, contrasts on the whole successfully enough with the patterns that have been established for Fletcher and Massinger, and it is possible to draw some reasonably clear conclusions regarding their respective shares in a play of divided authorship. It is doubtful that the pattern of Field can be very satisfactorily distinguished from the linguistic pattern of Beaumont; Beaumont's sparing use of ye as opposed to its more regular occurrence in the work of Field provides what is perhaps the most notable point of contrast in the practice of the two dramatists. The extent to which Field's work can be distinguished from Massinger's is evident from an examination of the linguistic forms present in The Fatal Dowry , a play on which they are known to have collaborated. Published in quarto in 1632, with a title-page ascription to "P. M. and N. F.," the play makes it possible to examine the linguistic preferences of the two dramatists in a work of their joint-authorship, and it is gratifying to see that their preferences are as readily distinguishable as here at least they appear to be. In his edition of the play, Mr. C. L. Lockert attributes the shares of the two dramatists as follows: to Massinger: I; III, lines 1-343; IV, 2, 3, 4; V; to Field: II; III, lines 344 to the end; IV, 1. 7 The linguistic evidence bears this out. The following table sets forth the occurrence in the play of those language forms that possess any value as authorial evidence. (I have distinguished scenes within an act only in cases where Lockert's attribution indicates dual authorship.) 's ye y' d'ee t'ee w'ee hath doth 'em them i'th' o'th' his ha' I: 4 1 3 9 II: 6 1 5 7 1 6 3 1 III (1-343): 3 1 3 --- (344-end): 1 3 1 2 1 IV, i: 1 4 1 1 2 5 1 2 1 --, ii-iv: 2 3 5 V: 6 12 As is to be expected, the evidence of hath is of no use in distinguishing the work of Massinger and Field, and doth , which Field might be expected to employ, does not appear in his share of the play. But Field's use of ye and y' , particularly in the second act, is striking; and he seems to be responsible for the single use of ye in Act III. The occurrence of d'ee, t'ee , and w'ee in IV, 1 is conspicuous. Massinger displays his normal preference for them to the contracted 'em ; this is particularly apparent in the fourth act, where Field's scene one employs only 'em 's, while the remainder of the act, for which Massinger is responsible, employs only them 's. We note as well Massinger's tendency to avoid such contractions as i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his . Field seems to be wholly responsible for the occurrence of these forms in The Fatal Dowry . The use of the contraction ha' in Act II, near the end of Act III, and in IV, 1, seems clearly to be his, as well. Even on this small scale it can be seen that the language preferences displayed in Field's unaided plays are evident in a play of which he was a joint author—and evident in such a way as to enable one to distinguish in some measure his work from that of his collaborator. Since The Fatal Dowry does not exhibit his customary use of doth , it does not present a completely accurate picture of his linguistic pattern, but on the evidence which it affords, and from what we know of his language preferences from his unaided work, we can form a reasonably accurate notion of what Field's linguistic practices will be. They will tend together to form a linguistic pattern marked by the occasional use of ye and y' , a fairly regular use of hath and doth , and a tendency to employ such contractions as ha' and combinations with 'ee which, although present in certain of the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations, are not found in their unaided work. The texts of the four plays in which Field's work is present in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon preserve the linguistic patterns of the collaborating dramatists in what is, on the whole, a remarkably faithful degree. Two of the texts appear to have been set from Crane transcripts, and Crane's care in preserving the linguistic forms of his authors has been noted. 8 It is clear from the linguistic evidence available that the hand which wrote the first two of the Four Plays in One could not have written the last two. The linguistic criteria that emerge from The Knight of Malta and The Queen of Corinth make it evident beyond any doubt that there are three distinct patterns of language preferences present in both. And The Honest Man's Fortune exhibits linguistic features which guide one at least in evaluating the claims of some of the suggested collaborators. Four Plays in One Field : Induction, The Triumph of Honour, The Triumph of Love. Fletcher : The Triumph of Death, The Triumph of Time. The induction and the first two plays with the connecting link between them seem clearly to be the work of a single dramatist. The last two plays are just as clearly the work of a second dramatist, who beyond any doubt is Fletcher. The linguistic pattern that emerges from the induction and the first two Triumphs I regard as Field's. Here ye is found 27 times, in the presence of 20 occurrences of hath , and 17 of doth . The contraction d' for do appears here 3 times, always in the combination d'ye , a form which may represent a compositorial alteration of Field's d'ee . Similarily, the single occurrence of the combination wi'you may be an expansion of Field's contraction w'ee . There is a single use of ha' for have . In contrast to this linguistic pattern is the typically Fletcherian one of the last two Triumphs, with its 60 ye's , and the absence in it of a single occurrence of hath or doth . As has been pointed out, there is nothing to distinguish Field's use of 'em , i'th' , o'th' , or 's for his from Fletcher's. The language of the first two of the Four Plays in One is studded with grammatical inversions that generally accomplish the purpose of relegating some form of the verb to the end of the sentence or clause. This feature of syntax is not particularly notable in the more realistic dialogue of Field's unaided comedies, though it does occur in both; an example is such a sentence as "wit's a disease, that fit employment wants," from A Woman is a Weather-cocke (IV, 1); or, from Amends for Ladies : "this same horrid newes which me assaults" (I, 1), and "no one, her foot steps euer more should meete" (II, 3). One might note as well: "he knows himself in poverty lost," and "that his dear father might internment have," both from Field's II, 1 of The Fatal Dowry . In accordance with the higher moral purpose of the first two Triumphs of the Four Plays in One , verse thus embroidered with poetic diction was evidently deemed the appropriate medium of speech. The result is such phrases as the following, from "The Triumph of Honour": "Athens shall stand, / and all her priviledges augmented be" (27a); 9 "O make him such a Captive as thy self / unto another wouldst, great Captain, be" (27a); "let not soft nature so transformed be" (27b); "if your strange secret do no lower lie" (29b); "though thou stronger be" (30a); "ere I so impious prove" (30a); "when . . . we to speak do come" (32a). And similarly, from "The Triumph of Love": "I'll rather silent die" (33a); "heavens goodnesse shall prevented be" (33a); "my fraught of health my sicknesse is" (34a); "my heart a plague hath caught" (35b); "to some remote place move" (35b); "I no joy shall finde" (35b); "I joy they all so happily are pleas'd" (39a). Such stylistic mannerisms as these are to be found in Field's share of each of the following three plays. They do not constitute linguistic criteria of the sort upon which the present study is based, but I have drawn attention to them for whatever corroborative value they might have for substantiating Field's claim to those shares in the plays of the canon that I have singled out as his. I draw attention as well to another non-linguistic characteristic of Field's which, evaluated with the other criteria here considered, has I think a certain value as authorial evidence. This is Field's fondness for having characters speak in unison. I count 18 instances of speeches headed Omnes in A Woman is a Weather-cocke , and 13 in Amends for Ladies . There are three such speeches in the folio text of the Four Plays in One (here they are headed All ). One occurs at the end of "The Triumph of Honour" (31b), the other two near the end of "The Triumph of Love" (38b and 39a); both Triumphs I attribute to Field. The folio text abounds with proper names, forms of address, and nouns used in the vocative. Thus, for example, we have: "I protest (my deer Don)" [25b]; "ask mercie? (Roman)" [27a]; "Can't not be done ( Valerius )" [28a]; "For thy blest sake / (O thou infinitie of excellence)" [32a]; "is Rinaldo (brother) / . . ., heard of living?" [35a]; "how oft (forgetfull Lord)" [39b]; "so strict command (Sir)" [43a]; "Thou hast forgot ( Desire )" [46a]; "By this we note (sweet heart)" [48b]. This, together with the manner in which the Fletcherian ye is so carefully preserved, leads me to believe that the manuscript behind the folio text was the work of the scribe Ralph Crane, despite the fact that, unlike the usual text derived from a Crane transcript, this one is not divided into scenes. The Knight of Malta Field : I; V. Fletcher : II; III, 1, 4; IV, 2. Massinger : III, 2-3; IV, 1, 3-4. Three distinct linguistic patterns are present in the play. Those respectively of Fletcher and Massinger can be distinguished readily enough by the presence and the absence of ye , and by Fletcher's preference for 'em to them , as opposed to Massinger's preference for the expanded to the contracted form. The third pattern is one which makes use of a scattering of ye' s, and employs the third person singular verb forms hath and doth to an extent that is unknown in the work of either Fletcher or Massinger. I identify it as the pattern of Field. The linguistic forms present in Fletcher's share are what one would expect: 179 ye' s, no occurrence of hath , a single use of doth . For 25 occurrences of em' there are but 4 of them . As for other contractions in the Fletcherian portion of the play: there are 6 instances of i'th' , 6 of o'th' , 2 of h'as . In Massinger's portion of the play there is a single occurrence of ye , 6 of hath , none of doth , none of 'em , 7 of them . H'as is found a single time, but i'th' and o'th' do not occur. In the two acts which comprise the share of Field, ye appears 11 times, hath 16 times, doth 13 times, 'em 16 times, them 5 times. Here the contractions i'th ' and h'as occur once each, o'th' twice. The play's single instance of the contraction w'ee (here spelled 'we ) appears in V, 1, a Field scene. It is probably significant that the character who is first brought on the stage (I, 1) with the direction "Enter Zanthia alias Abdella" is referred to as "Zanthia" in speech headings and subsequent stage directions throughout Field's first act, but is designated in speech headings and stage directions as Abdella through the remainder of the play, including Field's Act V. On the evidence of such stage directions as "Oriana ready above" (I, 2), "The Scaffold set out and the staires" (II, 5), "A Table out, two stooles" (III, 4), and "Altar ready, Tapers &amp; booke" (V, 1), the first folio text clearly derives from a prompt-copy, but one in which a rather confusing duplication of names for a single character was allowed to stand in speech headings and stage directions. To judge from the frequent use of parentheses with the vocative in the folio text, the prompt-book was the work of Ralph Crane. 10 The division of the text into scenes, together with the careful manner in which the evidence of ye is preserved, point as well to Crane's work. The Field scenes in The Knight of Malta have their share of grammatical inversions of the sort that have been singled out in connection with Field's contribution to the Four Plays in One . Thus in I, 1 of The Knight of Malta is found, among others: "this one smile, from Oriana sent" (71a); "thy brands that glow thus in my veines, / I will with blood extinguish" (72a); "are you for this great solemnity / This morne intended?" (72a); "Six fresh Gallies / I . . . / This morne discride" (72a); "I have this answer fram'd" (73a). In I, 3 there is: "If any therefore can their manners tax" (73b); in V, 1: "I would not . . ., this fraile Bark, / . . . no better steeres-man had" (92b), and "my minde doth thy mind kisse" (93a); and in V, 2: "Whilst I obscurely in some corner vanish" (94a), and " 'bout thy stiff neck, we this halter hang" (95a). The manner in which the characters tend to speak in unison in the Field scenes of the play, but seldom elsewhere, is worth noting. There are 5 speeches headed All in Field's Act I, and an equal number in his Act V. On only one other occasion in the play do we find such a choral response: in Fletcher's II, 5. The Queen of Corinth Field : III; IV. Fletcher : II. Massinger : I; V. That the play is the work of three dramatists is evident from the three distinct linguistic patterns which emerge. There is no difficulty at all in identifying two of these. That which prevails throughout the first and fifth acts, and that which is evident throughout the second, represent respectively the patterns of Massinger and Fletcher. The third pattern—one which simultaneously employs ye, hath , and doth — is to be traced through Acts III and IV, and can, I think, be identified as that of Field. The linguistic forms which comprise the three patterns have been carefully preserved in the extant text of the play; on the basis of linguistic criteria alone, the distinction between the shares of Fletcher and Massinger is as sharply drawn as one could desire. In Fletcher's second act there are 66 occurrences of ye , none of hath , 6 of 'em , a single instance of them , 5 of i'th , 2 of o'th '. Massinger's portion of the play contains no ye 's. Hath appears 12 times, 'em once, them 26 times. There are no occurrences of the contractions i'th' or o'th '. Ye is found a total of 17 times in the two acts ascribed to Field. Hath occurs 11 times. Doth , which does not appear in the Fletcher or Massinger portions, is used 3 times. The two occurrences of wi' for with , both of which appear in the combination wi'ye (IV, 1) may represent compositorial expansions of Field's contraction w'ee . Regarding the Field scenes of The Queen of Corinth , a number of points are worth mentioning that serve to link them with his work elsewhere. There are grammatical inversions of the sort that have been noted in the Four Plays in One and The Knight of Malta . Thus, in III, 1: "your Mother / Did from a private state your Father raise" (10b); "Conons forfeit state / . . . he / Hath from your Mother got restor'd to him" (11a); "what ere he be / Can with unthankfulnesse assoile me" (12a). And in IV, 3: "Our Mother was a Spartan Princesse borne" (16b). The fairly uncommon verb "exquire" ("to search out, seek for") which occurs in this same scene ("How she came by it, yet is not exquir'd"), occurs as well in I, 1 of A Woman is a Weather-cocke ("but first exquire the Truth"). Of the play's four instances of speeches headed All, three are found in scenes by Field (III, 1 and IV, 1). Finally, a passage from Field's IV, 3 of The Queen of Corinth echoes, in a fairly tantalizing way that may or may not point to a single author, similar passages from scenes that I regard as his in the Four Plays in One and The Knight of Malta . The idea set forth in each is the commonplace one that bad deeds blot out good ones. Each conveys this notion in an identical figure of speech: a reader, perusing the records of an individual life, will view with pleasure all that is worthy, but stop in disgust at the account of a single opprobrious act, with the result that any subsequent good will go unknown and unapproved. Here is the passage from The Queen of Corinth : when Posterity Shall read your Volumes fill'd with vertuous acts, And shall arrive at this black bloody leafe, Noting your foolish barbarisme, and my wrong, (As time shall make it plaine) what followes this Disciphering any noble deed of yours Shall be quite lost, for men will read no more. In Field's V, 1 of The Knight of Malta occurs the following: Think on the legend which we two shall breed Continuing as we are, for chastest dames And boldest Souldiers to peruse and read, I and read thorough, free from any act To cause the modest cast the booke away, And the most honour'd Captaine fold it up. Beside both these passages should be set this from "The Triumph of Honour," the first of the Four Plays in One : When men shall read the records of thy valour, thy hitherto-brave vertue, and approach (highly content yet) to this foul assault included in this leaf, this ominous leaf, they shall throw down the Book, and read no more, though the best deeds ensue, . . . . Parallel passages are, of course, notoriously untrustworthy aids to determining authorship. I draw attention to these simply because, so far as I know, they have not been previously noted; and as we have seen, the sections of the three plays in which each occurs are, linguistically at least, of a piece. The Honest Man's Fortune Field : I; II; III, 1b (from the entrance of Montague to the end), 2; IV. Field and Fletcher : V, 1, 4. Field and Massinger : III, 3. Fletcher : V, 2-3. Massinger : III, la (to the entrance of Montague). The play is extant in two texts: that of the 1647 folio, and a scribal transcript preserved as MS. Dyce 9 in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The manuscript is the work of the scribe Edward Knight, book-keeper of the King's Company; at the end of the text is the license of Sir Henry Herbert, to the effect that the play, "being an olde one, and the Originall lost was reallow'd by mee this 8 Febru. 1624. Att the intreaty of Mr. [Taylor]." The manuscript title-page states that The Honest Man's Fortune was "Plaide in the yeare 1613," and the list of actors given for the play in the 1679 folio seems to bear this out. Chambers suggests ( The Elizabethan Stage , III, 227) that the original performers were Lady Elizabeth's men; but by 1625, the play had passed into the hands of the King's Company, a leading member of which, Joseph Taylor, was soliciting Herbert to re-license it. Herbert's entry in his Office-Book confirms his license at the end of the manuscript: "For the king's company. An olde play called The Honest Man's Fortune , the originall being lost, was re-allowed by mee at Mr. Taylor's intreaty, and on condition to give mee a booke [ The Arcadia ], this 8 Februa. 1624" ( Herbert , p. 30). The manuscript omits one scene (V, 3) present in the folio text, and supplies a different ending in place of the folio's rather indelicate one. The relation of the two texts has been fully discussed by Dr. Johan Gerritsen in his edition of the manuscript. 11 Since the original prompt-book was missing in 1625, the supposition would be that Knight's transcript was made from foul papers; since, however, the manuscript displays a number of theatrical cuts, Dr. Gerritsen considers the copy to have been "foul papers prepared for the stage before the original prompt-book was made" ( Gerritsen , p. xlvi). The copy for the folio text he assumes to have been "either the same foul papers or the original prompt-book." The linguistic evidence to be derived from each text is very much of a piece, a fact which further supports Dr. Gerritsen's belief that both versions of the play "immediately derive from the same manuscript" ( Gerritsen , p. ix). The folio displays 32 occurrences of ye ; there are 33 in the manuscript. Hath occurs 18 and 20 times respectively in the folio and manuscript texts; doth is found 13 times in each. I'th' occurs 8 and 5 times respectively in folio and manuscript; the folio's three additional instances of the form all appear in V, 3, a scene which the manuscript text omits. The folio's 3 occurrences of h'as are found in this scene as well. The folio's 9 instances of ha' have been reduced to 3 in the manuscript; but apart from this, the chief variation in linguistic practice which the two texts display concerns the use of 'em and them , and this chiefly in the second act. Act II of the folio shows a rather decided preference for the expanded form, with 4 'em 's as opposed to 14 them' 's. In Act II of the manuscript, the preference has all but disappeared as 'em occurs 8 times, them 10 times. Of the folio's three contractions in 'ee , only one appears in the manuscript. Each text displays but a single occurrence of 's for his , and in each case it is the same one ( for's , in I, 1). The play presents one of the most complex authorial problems in the canon. It has been generally supposed to be the work of at least four, and possibly five, dramatists; the candidates for authorship most usually brought forward are Fletcher, Massinger, Field, Tourneur, and Webster. 12 In an attempt to evaluate Tourneur's claim to a share in the authorship of The Honest Man's Fortune , I have examined The Atheist's Tragedy , the one play that is regarded as unquestionably his. The linguistic evidence which it displays is as follows: 13 's ye y' hath doth 'em them i'th' i'the o'th' o'the h'as his ha' 1 17 14 10 18 12 7 15 5 14 7 8 37 Since none of these forms occurs in any marked degree in The Atheist's Tragedy , the evidence they afford is slight at best; in the case of The Honest Man's Fortune , where Tourneur's work is present, if at all, in no more than some five scenes, it is altogether worthless. That such forms as doth and o'th' , which Tourneur uses in The Atheist's Tragedy , do not occur in Act I of The Honest Man's Fortune (the section of the play that has been most often claimed for him), means nothing, for there are single acts in The Atheist's Tragedy in which neither form occurs. On the other hand, the accidence of The Atheist's Tragedy exhibits several rather striking linguistic forms, and if any one of these were found to be at all prominent in either the folio or the manuscript text of The Honest Man's Fortune , the case for Tourneur's presence in the play would be considerably strengthened. In The Atheist's Tragedy one finds, for example, 4 occurrences of the second person singular verb form shat (for shalt ); a single use of sha'not (for shall not ); 3 instances of the second person singular verb form wut (for wilt ). In the folio text of The Honest Man's Fortune (II, 2), there is a single occurrence of wot ( wilt in the manuscript). Neither of the other forms is found in either text of the play. The evidence is so slight as to make any pronouncement a necessarily indeterminate one; but such as it is, I see nothing that points positively in the direction of Tourneur's presence in the play. In the case of Webster, there are three unaided plays to provide a source of authorial evidence: The White Devil (published in quarto in 1612), The Duchess of Malfi (quarto 1623), and The Devil's Law Case (quarto 1623). The linguistic evidence which these present is as follows: 14 's ye y' hath doth 'em them i'th' o'th' a'th' h'as his ha' WD 1 42 17 71 32 11 8 * 2 19 DM 2 55 28 3 80 31 20 ** 1 15 DLC 2 5 1 2 55 46 11 11 20 1 The discrepancy between the high rate of occurrence of hath and doth in the two tragedies, and the negligible use of the forms in the tragicomedy of The Devil's Law Case , is notable. Apart from this, however, the linguistic practices that are evident in each play, taken together, comprise a pattern of language preferences that is an extremely consistent one. Here the preferences are pronounced; the contracted forms that Webster favors occur in each of these plays with well-nigh equal frequency; forms that appear only in a negligible degree in one play, appear, if at all, in a negligible degree in the others. Thus we find Webster making hardly any use of ye , of the contraction h'as and—most surprisingly of all, perhaps—of the contraction 'em . On the other hand, his use of i'th', o'th' (which often occurs in his work as a'th' ), and 's for his in each of his three unaided plays far exceeds the occurrence of these forms in any single play of such other dramatists whose unaided work I have examined as Fletcher, Massinger, Field, and Ford. A linguistic pattern in which the contractions i'th', o'th' , and 's for his loom so large, in which so little use is made of ye , and which displays such an overwhelming preference for them to the contracted 'em should stand forth as a reasonably distinguishable one. Later, in examining what I believe to be Webster's share in another play of the canon, The Fair Maid of the Inn , I will show the extent to which the pattern of linguistic usages characteristic of his work can in fact be singled out from the other patterns present in a collaborated play. Examining the linguistic evidence available in the two texts of The Honest Man's Fortune , however, one finds nothing that approximates very nearly the linguistic pattern of Webster as we know it. At best, in the folio text, i'th' occurs but 8 times in the entire play, and five of these occurrences are in the essentially Fletcherian fifth act. There are but 3 occurrences of o'th' in the whole play, and two of these are presumably Fletcher's. Both texts of the play exhibit only a single use of 's for his , and this appears in each case in I, 1, where 'em occurs to the un-Websterian total of 8 times. In no single scene of the play do we find the decided preference for them to 'em that is evident in all of Webster's unaided plays. The evidence of the one scene in the play—the folio version of II, 2—in which them 's markedly outnumber 'em 's seems less impressive in the light of the manuscript text, where 4 'em 's and 7 them 's replace the single 'em and 10 them 's of the folio. Nor does the occurrence of hath and doth in The Honest Man's Fortune accord well with such evidence as is available regarding Webster's use of the forms; for all the fact that the forms are not notably present in a late play like The Devil's Law Case , they occur frequently in The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi , plays that are usually dated between 1609-14, and so presumably reflect more clearly Webster's practice at the period when The Honest Man's Fortune was written and "plaide" (1613). Dr. Gerritsen, discussing the authorship of the play (pp. xlviii ff.), finds no satisfactory evidence of Webster's work on the basis of metrical tests and considerations of a more generally literary nature. On the basis of the available linguistic criteria, I find no evidence at all of Webster's work, and the claims to a share in the play's authorship that have been put forward on his behalf can, I think, be safely dismissed. Although one should, of course, be properly hesitant about oversimplifying a problem so fraught with difficulties as the authorship of The Honest Man's Fortune , it is hard to avoid the opinion that the subject has been needlessly complicated. I am quite certain that there are not five authors present in the play; I am not even sure that there are four. I suspect that there are only three: Fletcher, Massinger, and Field. Nearly everyone who has studied the play is willing to give Field the fourth act. I would give him a good deal more: all of acts one and two, and most of act three. I believe, indeed, that the play is very largely his, though there is no doubt at all that he received assistance from his sometime collaborators: from Massinger in Act III, from Fletcher in Act V. The linguistic evidence for the sections of the play that I would assign to him are what we would expect from his unaided work, and his work in collaboration elsewhere: a fairly regular but never considerable use of ye , the simultaneous use of hath and doth . The play's single instance of the contraction w'ee , which we have noted in Field's unaided work, occurs in his IV, 1. The fact that the parallel forms d'ee and t'ee appear respectively in V, 1 and V, 4 points I think—together with sundry other shreds of evidence—in a direction: namely, that Fletcher is not solely responsible for the fifth act. For one thing, the occurrence of ye is too low; when the form occurs only 16 times in a single scene, as opposed to 65 occurrences of you (in V, 4), or twice, as opposed to 26 occurrences of you (in V, 1), we can be fairly sure that we are not dealing with unaided Fletcher. Then one notes the cluster of speeches headed Omnes ; there are five of these in the play's final scene (V, 4). The folio ending of the play, altered in the manuscript, wherein the courtier Laverdine is disabused of his notion that the page Veramour, whom he has been pursuing, is a girl in disguise, has usually been written off as a typically Fletcherian lapse in taste. I doubt that he is responsible for the scene. In addition to the linguistic evidence and the evidence of the speech headings that have been noted, all of which point away from Fletcher in the direction of Field, I think that, judged on purely literary grounds, the scene has a decidedly Fieldian ring. It amounts, in effect, to putting on the stage the sort of situation described by Bould to Well-tri'd in IV, 2 of Amends for Ladies (lines 23 ff. of Dr. Peery's edition). The whole treatment of Veramour is characteristic of Field; when the faithful page declares to his impoverished master, "Ile run (fast as I can) by your horse side" (IV, 1), one is reminded of the Maid's cry to her lover, "Seruant see your mistresse / Turn'd to thy seruant running by thy Horse," in Amends for Ladies (IV, 4). The reference to Bevis' sword "Morglay" (spelled in the folio "morglachs") in I, 1 is paralleled in IV, 3 of A Woman is a Weather-cocke . There are several instances of grammatical inversions to be noted. Thus, in what I regard as the Field portion of III, 1: "Provided I might still this burthen bear" (160b); and in IV, 1: "I have seen you with a trencher waite," and "When like a servant I 'mong servants sit" (164a). Massinger's share in the play has been much debated. That his work is present here has been denied, as Dr. Gerritsen (p. lxix) points out, by Cruickshank, Chelli, and McIlwraith; and he himself (p. xci) is no more convinced of Massinger's share in the play than of Webster's. To Boyle's collection of Massinger parallels, Dr. Gerritsen (p. xciii) adds several more passages from Act III of The Honest Man's Fortune that approximate in some degree the phrasing of passages from Massinger's unaided work, with the comment that that "is the whole extent of the parallels, . . . ." It is not quite. Two such Massinger phrases as "shipwrack'd on the rocke of war" ( The Picture , II, 1) and "sings Encomiums to my virtues" ( The City Madam , II, 2) might appear to have come together in this passage from what I regard as the Massinger portion of III, 1 of The Honest Man's Fortune : "It is strange . . . / . . . you, that have made shipwracke / Of all delight upon this Rock cal'd marriage, / Should sing Encomions o[f]'t." The reference to "viandes, / Nourishing not provoking" in the same scene is of a piece with that to "Viands, that prouoke" in The Bondman (II, 1). The line in III, 3: "when I am your wife, / Which as it seems is frequent in the City" uses "frequent" in the sense of "widely current," just as Massinger does in The Roman Actor (I, 1): "'Tis frequent in the Citie, he hath subdued / The Catti, and the Daci." And in the same scene the expression "one that transcends / . . . / A million of such things as you" employs a verb which Massinger uses repeatedly (e.g., in The Duke of Milan , V, 1; Believe as you List , III, 3 [twice]; The Emperor of the East , I, 1; The Renegado , III, 5 and IV, 2; The City Madam , III, 3 and V, 3; The Bondman , I, 3 and II, 3; The Picture , I, 2 [twice]; The Roman Actor , I, 3; The Unnatural Combat , II, 3 and III, 3; The Parliament of Love , III, 2). For our purposes, however, the chief point in favor of Massinger's share in The Honest Man's Fortune is the linguistic evidence; it is, I think, no accident that the contracted forms that are sprinkled so generally throughout the play as a whole—forms which we know Massinger rarely employs—should all be completely absent from the first half of III, 1. This, together with the verbal evidence of parallel phrasings of the sort that I have noted, establishes his presence in the play. A final point is worth noting in connection with the play's complex authorial problem. On the evidence of purely verbal similarities of phrasing, there is I think reason to believe that the author of I, 1 is present as well in II, 3 and III, 2. In I, 1, the honest Montague cuts short his follower Longueville's well-intentioned efforts to rid him of his creditors thus: what one example since the time That first you put your hat off to me, have You noted in me to encourage you To this presumption? In II, 3, Amiens says to the same Longueville, who has taken up his cause in a public brawl: what weaknesse have you ever seen in me to prompt your selfe, that I could need your helpe, . . . In III, 2, Longueville has occasion to say to Amiens, who has implied doubt of his devotion: what have you seen in me or my behavior since your favours so plentifully showe[r]d upon my wants, that may beget distrust of my performance? I doubt that three different authors are responsible for these three speeches. Previous attributions have assigned them, respectively, to Tourneur, Webster, and Massinger. If so, the authors have managed to preserve a single tone to a truly remarkable degree in a collaborated play. Fletcher, it might be observed, employs the same type of rhetorical question in A Wife for a Month (IV, 5), when the heroine asks her lover why he has lied to save her life: "what weaknesse, Sir, / Or dissability do you see in me, / . . . to defraud me / Of Such an opportunity?" To summarize: I regard the play as primarily Field's, and consider him to be essentially responsible for the whole of Acts I, II, and IV. I think Massinger, who is certainly present in the play, responsible for the first 159 lines of III, 1; and I think that Massinger is present again, to an extent that I would not attempt to determine, in III, 3. As Massinger assisted the author in the third act, Fletcher assisted him in the composition of the fifth. I would regard scenes two and three of Act V as the work of Fletcher alone; scenes one and four contain, I think, the work of both dramatists. This, obviously, is collaboration of a more closely integrated sort than the division by act and scene that we have witnessed in The Knight of Malta and The Queen of Corinth ; but this should not make the collaboration the less credible. The joint work of Beaumont and Fletcher is generally more closely interwoven, as we have seen, than the joint work of Fletcher and Massinger tends to be. In the case of The Honest Man's Fortune , we are dealing, I think, with a play that Field had undertaken alone, which was running into the sands by the end of the fourth act—Dr. Gerritsen (p. ciii) speaks of the "sense of anticlimax in the fifth act"—and which was brought to a conclusion with the aid of Fletcher, working alone in V, 2 and 3, and in fairly close conjunction with the original author in V, 1 and 4. The two scenes that Fletcher alone contributed are the sheerest comic padding; V, 3 was omitted from the manuscript text, and so presumably from the revival of 1625. Why the services of Massinger should have been enlisted in Act III is harder to know, and fruitless to conjecture. Whether either dramatist was called in elsewhere is, of course, possible, but beyond proof. There is nothing in the play beyond the powers of Fletcher, Massinger, and Field; and only the Baconian sort of scholar should feel the need to attribute portions of the play to additional dramatists. In this respect, the purely literary arguments for Tourneur's authorship of the early scenes seem particularly dubious. As a matter of fact, to argue in purely literary terms, the early part of the play—the treatment of Montague, his encounter with the law, his high-placed and relentless enemy, his faithful friends and his heartless creditors, and the eminent personage who takes up his cause—reminds one of nothing so much as Massinger and Field's The Fatal Dowry . Dr. Gerritsen (pp. lxx-lxxi) would argue against a single author for Acts II and IV because the character Lapoop is a sea captain in IV, 1 and a land captain in II, 2. I doubt that we should be too straitly guided by such nice details of dramatic consistency in positing the number of authors present in an Elizabethan or Jacobean play. There is always the example of the Duchess of Malfi's eldest son, to say nothing of the children—or the lack of them—of Lady Macbeth. The Night Walker Fletcher : I, 7-8; II, 1. Fletcher and Shirley : I, 1-6; II, 2-4; III-V. In his Office-Book for 11 May 1633, Herbert records the receipt of two pounds for licensing "a play of Fletchers corrected by Sherley called The Night Walkers " ( Herbert , p. 34). There can be hardly any doubt that the play was originally a work of Fletcher's sole authorship, but it is equally beyond doubt that the manuscript behind the only substantive edition—the 1640 quarto—represented, not the Fletcherian original, but Shirley's revision. The texture of the linguistic pattern that is evident in the quarto text of the play is, in most respects, sufficiently Fletcherian with one important exception: the sharp reduction that seems clearly to have taken place in the occurrence of ye . The form occurs but 37 times in the entire play. There are 8 occurrences of hath (somewhat high for Fletcher) but, as is so often the case in his work, there are no occurrences of doth . The Fletcherian preference for the contracted ' em to the full pronominal form them is here as marked as ever: for 37 instances of ' em , there are but 7 of them . As for the other contractions that habitually appear in Fletcher, they are present here at their usual rate: i'th' (24 times), o'th' (14 times), h'as (3 times), 's for his (4 times). But in addition to such linguistic forms as these, there are present in The Night Walker a group of others of a distinctly un-Fletcherian nature. The most significant of these are the second person singular auxiliary verb forms shat and wot (used with or without the subject "thou" for, respectively, shalt and wilt ), and the third person singular auxiliaries, used almost always in the negative, shannot and wonnot (for shall not and will not ). Single instances of all these forms are to be found sporadically in the work of Beaumont. 15 In Fletcher's unaided work, I record no instances of shannot and wonnot , and but a single occurrence each of shat (in The Island Princess ) and wot (in The Mad Lover ). 16 The other non-Fletcherian forms which appear in The Night Walker are d'ee and w'ee , which we have formerly encountered chiefly in the work of Beaumont and Field. Finally, the play presents a rather considerable use of the contraction ha' (43 times), again a form that has been previously associated with Beaumont and Field. The contraction is not unknown in Fletcher, but its occurrence in his unaided plays is certainly limited. In the fifteen plays of his sole authorship, ha' appears 4 times (twice in The Loyal Subject , once each in Monsieur Thomas and The Island Princess ). As has been observed (above, footnote 6), ha' occurs rather more often in the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations. An examination of four plays by Shirley, the theoretical reviser of The Night Walker , makes it clear that all of these un-Fletcherian forms occur with some regularity in his unaided work. The figures for Shirley's plays and for The Night Walker , based on the original quarto editions, are as follows: shat shannot wot wonnot ha' d'ee w'ee The Bird in a Cage -- Q 1633 6 1 8 52 9 2 The Coronation -- Q 1640 1 4 3 3 5 4 The Duke's Mistress -- Q 1638 4 11 4 9 18 9 The Example -- Q 1637 4 1 12 15 6 The Night Walker -- Q 1640 5 1 5 9 43 8 1 I have considered the occurrence of any one of these forms in any scene of The Night Walker to afford evidence of Shirley's revising hand. The manner in which they are to be found throughout the extant text, together with the consistently low occurrence of ye , makes it clear that Shirley's revision extended over the whole play, and was not confined to single acts and scenes. It is evident from the four plays of his that I have examined that Shirley had no great regard for pronominal ye , though he occasionally employed forms in y' . Hath , on the other hand, he tended to use with some frequency—more frequently, at any rate, than Fletcher—as the following figures show. ye y' hath The Bird in a Cage 16 9 3 The Coronation 1 18 The Duke's Mistress 2 8 12 The Example 1 8 18 There is nothing to distinguish Shirley's use of such contractions as 'em , i'th' , and o'th' from Fletcher's. The occurrence in The Night Walker of language forms which can be shown to point to a distinct linguistic preference that was not shared by the two dramatists affords a remarkably valid index to precisely where and how Shirley altered Fletcher's original work. That his revision went beyond stylistic details is, however, certain. He is evidently responsible for changing the hero's name from "Wildgoose" to "Wildbrain." And the reference to Prynne's Histriomastix (III, 4) must be his. It cannot be Fletcher's, for Prynne's attack on the stage was not published until 1632, seven years after Fletcher's death, and the year before Shirley's revision of the play. Wit Without Money Fletcher plus an unidentified reviser : I-V. All previous studies of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon have included Wit Without Money among Fletcher's unaided plays. It bears all the features of his unaided work except what is, from the point of view of the present study, the most important one: the occurrence of ye . The form is used only a single time in the play, and while I have no real doubt that the comedy is primarily of Fletcher's authorship, I also have no doubt that the final form of the extant substantive edition (the 1639 quarto) is the work of a non-Fletcherian hand. If one is to regard the appearance of ye as a regularly recurring feature of Fletcher's linguistic usage (and all the available evidence indicates that it is), then the absence of the form from such a play as Wit Without Money cannot but be regarded as an indication that, in this respect at least, the linguistic practice that is displayed is not truly Fletcherian. In every other respect, the linguistic pattern of Wit Without Money is as typically Fletcherian as is to be found. As against 12 occurrences of them , there is overwhelming preference for the contracted form, which appears throughout the play as 'um and is used 63 times. The contractions usually associated with Fletcher are present: i'th' (11 times), o'th' (16 times), h'as (5 times), 's for his (twice). There are but 3 instances of hath , and doth does not appear. I should like to regard the play as a Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration of the sort represented by The Coxcomb , in which the occurrence of ye falls far below Fletcher's normal usage despite the fact that his share of the authorship is the major one. Though Fletcher seems to be responsible for thirteen scenes of The Coxcomb to Beaumont's eight, ye appears but 7 times ( SB , XI, 89); despite his relatively small share of the authorship, Beaumont has evidently given the final form to the finished play nonetheless. It is tempting to speculate that that is what has happened here, but there is nothing in Wit Without Money — neither a scene nor a portion thereof—that I can confidently regard as Beaumont's work. The fact that the pronominal contraction 'um appears throughout the play suggests a possible connection with Fletcher's work elsewhere in the canon. 17 If the play cannot be regarded as a Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration, I can only assume it to have been originally a work of Fletcher's sole authorship that came later, like The Night Walker , to be revised by another dramatist. But where, in The Night Walker , there are present certain definite linguistic forms which clearly betray Shirley's revising hand, there is nothing of the sort in Wit Without Money . The stage history of the two plays is, however, linked together. Chambers ( The Elizabethan Stage , III, 229) suggests that Wit Without Money was written for the Lady Elizabeth's Company. The Night Walker would seem to have been written either for the Lady Elizabeth's or the Queen's Revels ( Chambers , III, 231). Both plays passed into the repertory of Queen Henrietta's Company, and were performed at the Cockpit. The Night Walker was revived in 1633; it was acted at Court by Queen Henrietta's men on 30 January 1634 ( Chambers , III, 231); at the time of its revival it was revised by Shirley, as we have seen. Wit Without Money was revived a few years later; there are records of performances on 10 June 1635 and, at Court, where it was acted by Beeston's Boys, on 14 February 1637 ( Herbert , p. 58). By 10 August 1639, both plays were the property of Beeston's Boys. 18 One might speculate that, when it was re-staged, it too was revised, to the loss of the Fletcherian ye . That the revision, if any was indeed made, was not extensive is testified (1) by the typically Fletcherian linguistic pattern —apart from the absence of ye —that emerges from the extant text, (2) by the absence of any trace of a second dramatist's work, and (3) by the fact that, unlike the revised version of The Night Walker , it was not deemed necessary to submit the play to Herbert for re-licensing.

      <field name="heading_text">Some Folger Academic Drama Manuscripts by R. H. Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following notes are designed to provide students of the Jacobean drama with fuller information than has hither-to been available about the fair copies of the academic plays contained in two seventeenth-century manuscript miscellanies housed in the Folger Shakespeare Library and catalogued as MS. J.a.1 and MS. J.a.2 respectively. Hence this article may be taken to supplement the standard enumerative bibliography on the Oxford and Cambridge academic drama in CBEL I, 654-663, wherein no recording of these Folger plays was made. However, with a few exceptions, they were listed by title alone in Alfred Harbage's Annals of English Drama: 975-1700 (1940). A number of these plays, cast in the typical academic modes easiest for young persons to write—allegory and satire—are still unpublished; several of them, as I have indicated below, merit publication, if not on the basis of intrinsic literary excellence then at least on the merit of their cultural interest. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Folger MS. J.a.1 An early seventeenth-century manuscript collection of poems, plays, and prose tracts in different hands on different paper, originally separate items but bound in one volume in the eighteenth century. Paper, 200 ff. (20 x 15 cm.), xviii century calf. The volume contains the bookplate of a Marquess of Cholmondeley, presumably the second, George Horatio (1792-1870), and hence once formed a part of the library at Cholmondeley Castle, near Nantwich, Cheshire. This manuscript was not described by Seymour De Ricci when he catalogued the Folger holdings ( Census of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada [1935], I,ii), since the volume in question was obtained by the Folger Library in 1933 from Maggs (Cat. 569, item 204). (fol. 1 r-v blank: all folios unaccounted for below are blank) (1) fol. 2 r -5 r A fair copy of a Latin polemical poem entitled Pro Supplici Evangelicorum Ministrorum in Anglia . . . Authore A.M. (A bookdealer's or former owner's pencil notation identifies the author as Andrew McBille, and suggests a date of c 1604, without giving any evidence for the attribution). (2) fol. 7 r -17 v A fair copy of thirty-four Latin epigrams on theological and anti-papist topics e.g. No. 30: De Lupa Lustri Vaticam . Initial dedication to Iacobo, Fidei Defensori . The copy appears to be in the same hand as the previous item; and is probably by the same author. (3) Boot and Spurre fol. 19 r -23 r An anonymous prose dialogue or entertainment in English wherein characters such as Spurre, Slipper, Pumpe, Shoe, and Boote appear at an unspecified country inn. Boote and Shoe, claiming to be seasoned travellers, discourse of Mandeville, Ulysses, Coryat (whose Crudities first appeared in 1611 and hence set a terminus ab quo for the piece), Drake and Cavendish; see R. R. Cawley, The Voyagers and Elizabethan Drama (1938), for similar allusions. Interpolated are repartees of a scatological nature between Pumpe and Shootie, page to Shoe; as well as numerous word-plays on the shoemaker's trade. A useful discussion of the genre is contained in James H. Hanford, "The Debate Element in the Elizabethan Drama," in Kittredge Anniversary Papers (1913), pp. 445-456. This work has apparently not been printed. (4) Risus Anglicanus fol. 24 r -44 v c 1616-1620 This anonymous Latin comedy (or "daemonopoiia," to borrow Samuel Harsnet's coinage for devils' doings in A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures . . . of 1604 [ STC 12881], sig. V3 r ) of a fictitious, semi-historical nature, relates the alleged tribulations and failures at Rome of the leading Jesuit publicists to counteract the, to them, dangerous implications of the Oath of Allegiance of 1606 (as a result of the Gunpowder Plot crisis of 1605), and the important theoretical justifications thereof put forth by James I. This controversy, addressed to the crowned heads of Europe, fomented a savage duel between the rival doctrines of the divine right of kings and the divine right of the papacy, raged from 1606 until 1620, produced scores of acrid pamphlets and weighty tomes on both sides, and engaged the talented pens of the leading Catholic controversalists of the day : Suárez, Coquaeus, Pacenius, Becan, Scioppius, Eudaemon, and the most talented of this whole group, Bellarmine, all of whom appear as characters in this play (Bellarmine as Matthaeus Tortus, the pseudonym he employed in a tract of 1608). There is a full account of this controversy in the introduction to Charles H. McIlwain's edition of The Political Works of James I (1918), written from the point of view of a political scientist; supplementing McIlwain regarding the editorial aid which James recruited is an important article by David H. Willson, "James I and his Literary Assistants," Huntington Library Quarterly , VIII (1944-45), 35-58. A general account may be found in Etheldred L. Taunton, The History of the Jesuits in England: 1580-1773 (1901). Because of the satirical and sarcastic tone of the play, and the representation of Pope Paul V as in league with Lucifer, we must assume that the anonymous author was a loyal Anglican or Puritan. The action starts in Rome with a conclave between Ignatius Loyola, Lucifer, and Pope Paul V who complains that England is causing his domain the most trouble: "Omnem simul paraturum nobis excussit Anglia"; and a version of the Breve of September, 1608, against James I forbidding Catholics to take the Oath of Allegiance is given. This initial dramatic situation is reminiscent of the fictitious diabolic league entered into by Pope Alexander VI described in Barnabe Barnes' play The Devil's Charter of 1607 (ed. McKerrow, 1902), a play probably written to take advantage of the excitement in London about the Gunpowder Plot too. For a discussion of devils on the Elizabethan stage, see Robert H. West, The Invisible World (1939). The first three acts of Risus Anglicanus describe the resolves of the Jesuit publicists to counter the propaganda of James I, aided and abetted by their diabolic familiars, the daemunculi. In II, ii, Bellarmine (Tortus) announces that: "libellum scilicet ego hodie paro cum Torti nomine" [i.e., Responsio Matthaei Torti . . . ad librum inscriptum Triplici nodo triplex cuneus , Romae, 1608]. In III, i, Eudaemon chides Becanus and Scioppius for being drunk. In III, v, Coquaeus offers to out-do the work of the moderate French Dominican, Nicholas Coeffeteau, whose Responce à l'advertissement addressé par . . . Jacques I er à tous les princes et potentats de la chrestienté had appeared at Rouen in 1610: De Episcopatu scilicet Breui vacaturo, quem frustra Coeffetoeus sperat sibi, Quemque Ego facilè mihi indipiscar praemio, Anglorum Regi si scripto obsistam obviam: id monuit. By act IV, the fortunes of the Jesuit writers have suddenly waned (there is no clear chronology in the play); hence Ignatius tells Lucifer that the main concern is sustaining the morale of the now dashed writers: "Nunc itaque scriptores isti ne animus despondeant,/ Frustrationem qui repere cum infortunio,/ Ea primum cura est" (IV,iv). The daemunculi are now dispirited because they are convinced that they have none left to inspire; one of their number, Delerium, announces that : "Hominem neminem habemus uterque quem ductemus" (IV,v). In V, iv, the historical fact of the burning of Suárez's De Defensione Fidei Catholicae adversus Anglicanae Sectae Errores (Coimbra, 1613) by the Parlement of Paris in 1614 because of its implied attack on regal supremacy, is stated. His efforts foiled, the fictitious Suárez contemplates returning to the academic calm of his teaching post at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. By now Ignatius is thoroughly depressed and concedes (with an echo of the proverbial: sero sapiunt Phryges): "Phryges sumus, sero sapimus magno tandem edocti malo" (V,v). Finally the English Jesuit, Thomas Fitzherbert, (for whose career, see DNB ), is introduced speaking English, too ignorant to comprehend Latin, along with Robert Parsons (who is called manes parsoniani in the play since Parsons had died at Rome in 1610). The alleged failure of Fitzherbert's contribution to the controversy: An adioynder to the supplement of Father Robert Persons discussion of M. Doctor Barlowes Ansvvere (St. Omer, 1613: Folger, STC 11022) is mentioned and discussed; and the play ends with the apprehensive Fitzherbert being led off to a solemn examination by his superiors. The play lacks a secure sense of dramatic structure, and the dialogue is often wooden, but it surely deserves to be published because of its great historical interest. Despite "poetic license" and a somewhat fantastic introduction of devils, the text shows the author to be well versed in the great European logomachia of his day as he tries valiantly to produce satire of importance. A contemporary English audience would have relished the play's content: some anonymous doggerel verses of c 1620 reflect a general sentiment: "To play at bopeepe our Catholiques striue/ Who late with the deuill a Bargaine did driue . . ." (Folger MS.4760, fol. 1 r ). (5) fol. 45 r -46 r A fair copy of the Latin funeral eulogy of Sir Thomas White (d. 12 Feb., 1566/7), founder of St. John's College, Oxford, attributed by the DNB to Edmund Campion (1540-1581), the Jesuit martyr, who proceeded B. A. at St. John's in 1561. The title runs as follows: Funebris Oratio in Obitum Thomae White/ Militis Praetoris quondam Londinensis/ Fundatoris Collegii Di Ioannis/ Praecursoris Oxoniensi, habita per/ Edmundum Campianum in/ Artibus Magistrorum Eiusdem Collegii/ Alumnum. (6) fol. 47 r -63 r dated in MS. 20 Nov., 1605 A fair copy of an English prose treatise on dreams, by the physician Richard Haydocke of New College, Oxford, who proceeded B. A. on 16 Jan., 1592. The title runs: Oneirologia: or A briefe discourse of the nature of Dreames . . . (7) fol. 71 r -81 r dated in MS. 1617 A fair copy of an English prose tract, attributed in the MS. in a different hand to Dr. Willet (presumably Andrew Willett, the controversial divine, rector of Barley; see DNB ). The title runs: Reasons and motiues to induce/ the Spiritualitye and Temporaltie of/ this Kingdome to graunt vnto/ the Kinges most excellent Ma: tie / a large Subsidie and Contribution. (8) Iter Boreale fol. 84 r -92 r A fair copy of the Latin travel poem, modeled on Horace's trip to Brundisism ( Sat. , I, v), written c 1584 by Richard Eedes (1555-1604), of Christ's Church, Oxford, B.A. 1574, later Dean of Worcester. Other copies exist in British Museum Add. MS. 30352; Rawlinson Ms. B 223. (9) Secundum iter Boreale fol. 94 r -100 v A fair copy of the English travel poem Iter Boreale , of the same genre as the previous item, by Richard Corbet (1582-1635). For modern edition, see The Poetical Works of Richard Corbet , ed. J. A. W. Bennett &amp; H. R. Trevor-Roper (1955), pp. 31-49. (10) A Christmas Messe fol. 105 r -115 v dated in MS 1619 An anonymous English verse entertainment of some 600 lines. The action concerns the insatiable hunger of Belly ("My gutts within my bulke doe rumble"), which is temporarily excruciating since King Beef and King Brawn, along with their respective cohorts, are struggling for precedence and have eluded the province (and cleaver) of Cook for the time being. Finally Cook puts an abrupt stop to their wrangling, takes them in charge, and proudly promises to prepare the best Christmas feast ever for Belly. Interspersed are dialogues between Trencher and Tablecloth; Bread and Salt; Vinegar, Pepper and Mustard. Cf. Thomas Flatman, "A Character of a Belly-God," in Poems &amp; Songs (4th ed., London, 1686, pp. 152-156). This play, while slight, is amusing and hence could bear publication. (11) Heteroclitanomalonomia fol. 119 r -133 r dated in MS 1613 An anonymous English verse adaptation of the Latin prose tract Bellum Grammaticale by the Italian humanist Andrea Guarna, which was first printed at Cremona in 1511 and went through some 103 editions between 1511 and 1739 in Europe. It was translated into English prose in 1569 by W. Hayward (rptd in Lord Somers' Tracts , 2nd ed., London 1809, I, 523-554; for references to the Bellum Grammaticale in England, see CHEL VI, 482-483); made into a Latin play by Leonard Hutton c 1583 that was not printed until 1635 (see W.W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English printed drama to the Restoration [1951], II, 945, No. L-13; synopsis in Shakespeare Jahrbuch , XXXIV [1898], 273-275; comment in F.S. Boas, University Drama in the Tudor Age [1914], pp. 256-267). The Folger play differs considerably from Hutton's while retaining the central theme of explaining linguistic irregularities as stemming from the faction and rivalry of the two powerful kings in the realm of Syntax: Noun (Poeta) and Verb (Amo) with their respective followers, both of whom are attempting to control Oratio (rhetoric). It should not be amiss to note that while Guarna was primarily concerned, as a good humanist schoolmaster, with devising a fable or "talking picture" as a pedagogical means of teaching students Latin, he was also involved in accounting for the influence of the dynamic or spoken aspect of language on the static or written: the current quarrel in American university circles between the descriptive linguist and the prescriptive grammarian continues another aspect of the age-old problem of what and how to teach the young. The structure of the Folger play derives ultimately from the Psychomachia and hence is similar to other English allegorical plays of the period such as Lingua, Pathomachia, Technogamia , and Microcosmus : see H. K. Russell, "Tudor and Stuart Dramatizations of Natural and Moral Philosophy," Studies in Philology , XXXI (1934), 1-15. Some differences between Hutton's play and the Folger play run as follows: the Folger play starts with Priscian holding his traditionally battered head and bewailing the riot in the kingdom: Hutton's play starts with a long speech by Poeta's parasite Ille; the arbiters who terminate the broil and dole out justice are Lily, Priscian, and Thomas Robinson (the Dean of Durham, fl. 1520-1561, who added the section on heteroclites to Lily's Latin Grammar ): while Hutton's arbiters are Linacre, Lily, Priscian, and Despanterius (the Belgian grammarian). The title of the Folger play may be construed as "the baneful effects of the irregular parts of speech." A useful check-list of the early editions of Lily's Grammar may be found in the introduction to Vincent J. Flynn's edition for the Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints series (1945). Heteroclitanomalonomia strikes me as a poorly written play which would hardly repay the effort of transcription and editing; but it is certainly a typical academic product, and schoolmasters' shop-talk. (12) Periander fol. 134 r -157 v A later fair copy of the verse tragedy in English by John Sansbury (or Sandsbury; see DNB ) which was acted at St. John's College, Oxford, at a Christmas entertainment in 1607. This play was edited in 1923 for The Malone Society by F. S. Boas as a section of The Christmas Prince volume; on pp. xvi-xviii, Boas provided a synopsis of this tragedy of a tyrant of Corinth who rashly slew his innocent wife Melissa on false accusations. Alfred Harbage's comparison of the Folger copy to Boas's edition appeared in Modern Language Notes , L (1935), 501-505, and may be supplemented as follows: the Folger copy may be based on St. John's MS a.52 (the basis of the Boas text) since it silently incorporates the marginal emendation (in another hand) of discourse for this course (Boas l. 8635); also it contains numerous substantive variants such as dare not for cannot (Boas, l. 8911), locks his gates for lost his gates (Boas, l. 8908), which may be regarded as justifiable textual "improvements." (13) fol. 161 r -165 v A fair copy of an unsigned English prose tract entitled on fol. 162 r : Especiall Notes concerning her Ma: ties Nauie and Sea-seruice . . . (which suggests a composition date prior to 1603). An alternate and misleading title, inserted in another hand on fol. 161 r , runs as follows: A Tract Concerninge the shippinge of England. For similar tracts urging reform in the administration of the British navy, see Conyers Read, Bibliography of British History, Tudor Period, 1485-1603 (1933), No. 2517. (14) Christmas his Showe fol. 169 r -174 r dated 1615 in MS. A fair copy of a masque by Ben Jonson, which is considerably earlier than the version which first appeared in the 1640 Folio under the title of Christmas his Masque . See Ben Jonson , ed. Herford &amp; Simpson (1925-1952), VII, 433-434, for full discussion. (15) fol. 175 r -182 v dated in MS. 1611 A fair copy in mixed secretary and Italian script of Sir Walter Raleigh's English prose tract: A Discourse touching a Marriage betweene Prince Henry of England and a Daughter of Savoye. See The Works of Sir Walter Raleigh (1829), VIII, 236-252. For discussion, see E. C. Wilson, Prince Henry &amp; English Literature (1946), pp. 55, 97 ff. (16 a) Conviviam Philosophicum fol. 183 r-v A Latin text of the well-known "Mitre" poem proposing a festive London gathering of court wits of John Donne's circle, c September, 1611; and celebrating in particular Thomas Coryate (1564?-1615), the privileged buffoon of the court of James I. The title runs as follows: Conviviam Philosophicum tentum in clauso terminj Michaelis in crastino festi S. Egidij in campis authore— Doctore Rodolpho Colfabio Enaeacensi. As in a roman á clef , celebrities such as Christopher Brooke appear under thinly veiled pseudonyms as "torrens"; all of these names except that of the author (whose pseudonym is still unkeyed: see F. B. Williams Jr., "Renaissance Names in Masquerade," PMLA , LXIX [1954], 318) were unkeyed by Andrew Clark in his edition of this poem in his standard edition of John Aubrey's Brief Lives (1898), II, 50-53. The Folger copy has some substantive variants from Clark's text: e.g., on l.35, F reads pererrabit ; Clark reads peragrabit . Clark's text was reprinted in 1937 as part of the Hoskyns canon by Miss Louise B. Osborn in her dissertation John Hoskyns, 1566-1638 (Yale Studies in English, LXXXVII, 1937, pp. 196-199; 288-291), on the slender basis of one manuscript ascription. For a careful study of the poem, see I. A. Shapiro, "The 'Mermaid Club'," MLR , XLV (1950), 6-17. (16 b) fol. 184 r-v A somewhat expanded English version of the preceding poem, attributed to John Reynolds, Fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1600, by Andrew Clark (ed. cit.) II, 53, but unsigned in the Folger copy. (17) fol. 185 r-v A short Latin gazetteer of Italian cities entitled: Vrbium Italicarum Descriptio Thomas Edwardi Angli (e.g.,: Padua. Extollit Paduam Iuris studium et medicina). There were several Oxford men named Thomas Edwards in the opening decades of the 17th century who might have compiled this listing, such as the one who obtained his B. A. at Exeter in 1616. (18) Gigantomachia, or Work for Jupiter fol. 186 r -200 r An anonymous English verse play of some 600 lines wherein Bounce-bigge, leader of the giants, challenges Jupiter and the gods who have dethroned Saturn on the charge of alleged cannibalism, and have disposed power in a triumvirate of Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto. The giants, whose ranks include such fantastic personages as Huge-high, Rumble, the giantess Rouncival, Thunderthwart, Bumcracke, and their allies, the Hills, after rejecting with noisy indignation an offer of peace and amity, are dispersed with fatality by Thunder the terrible agent of Jupiter. The giant Thumpapace alludes to Lily's Latin Grammar on fol. 198 r : "Come Rounciuall, we're lag, but weel' not hammer / Wee'le chuse those hills, that lie besides the Grammer / Heteroclits that are in mappe of Lillie." A cancellans pasted on fol. 199 r in what appears to be the same hand, provides a dozen lines or so in which the giants are killed outright by Thunder. The theme of a battle between the giants and the gods was a Renaissance favorite: see De Witt T. Starnes and E. W. Talbert, Classical Myth and Legend in Renaissance Dictionaries (1955), pp. 74-75; for a fused Christian-pagan interpretation of gigantes , see Alexander Ross, Mel Heliconium , 1642, s.v. The term gigantomachia was used in 1659 to describe the late struggle between Charles I and the Scots: Gigantomachia hvivs saecvli, sive, De rebellione scotia contra regem carolum . . . Londini, 1659 (Library of Congress, 942.06 / P 42 n); see also Wing G-698. A genuine mock-heroic, Scarron's Typhon, ou la Gigantomachia (1644), was translated anonymously into English in 1665; see Albert H. West, L'influence Française dans la poésie burlesque en Angleterre entre 1600 et 1700 (Paris, 1931, pp. 45-52). There is but slight resemblance between the Folger play and Thomas Heywood's The Golden Age (c 1610), which is mainly concerned with the philandering of Jupiter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Folger MS. J.a.2 An early seventeenth-century miscellany of manuscript poems, plays, and prose tracts on the same paper throughout in several hands. Paper, 88 ff. (20 x 15 cm.), bound in original calf. Five leaves at the end, on the stubs of which writing is visible, have been cut out; likewise an initial flyleaf (conjugate with fol. A4) has been cut out. The name Fra: Corbet is inscribed on the extant flyleaf, perhaps indicating the original compiler, or a later owner. A Fra: Corbet matriculated as pensioner at St. John's College, Cambridge, in the Easter term of 1619 (John Venn &amp; J. A. Venn, The Book of Matriculations and Degrees [1913], p. 176). This manuscript was not catalogued by De Ricci (loc. cit.), since the volume in question was obtained by the Folger Library in 1933 from Maggs (Cat. 572, item 266). (1) fol. 1 r -2 r A fair copy of an anonymous English contemptus mundi poem of 102 ll., entitled: A Conflicte between death &amp; youth . The poem, which has an abrupt or imperfect ending, is cast in debate form; the incipit, spoken as a complaint by Youth, reads: "O spightfull death presumtious in thy wage/" (2) fol. 2 v An astrological figure on the lower half of the page indicating the influence of the planets on the different hours of the day, with an anonymous short comment in English, beginning: The Planet of w ch the day is named always ruleth the first howre . . . (3) Melanthe fol. 3 r -24 v MS. copy after 1615 This Latin pastoral play was written by Samuel Brooke of Trinity College, Cambridge, and acted before James I on 10 March 16 14/5. It was printed the following year (Greg, No. L-7). The play was carefully edited by J. S. G. Bolton for the Yale Studies in English , LXXIX (1928), from an exemplar of the 1615 edition then in possession of Professor Tucker Brooke. Bolton was in error in stating on p. 10 that "There are no manuscript copies of this play, the single printed edition having sufficiently supplanted them"; but the Folger MS. copy appears to have no independent textual value since it follows the same tradition as the Folger exemplar of the 1615 ( STC 17800) text, with numerous accidental variants such as the spelling and placing of the vernacular interjections in I,iii (Bolton's ll. 49-72). On fol. 3 r , the Folger MS. has a dramatis personae and cast of Trinity actors which tallies with the actors listed by Bolton (pp. 202-205, from British Museum Add. MS. 6211, p. 33, and the list in G. C. Moore Smith, College Plays , p. 78, from an insertion in the Bodleian copy of the 1615 printed text). The Folger MS. (fol. 3 v ) also confirms Bolton's dating of the play (p.10), as 10 March 1614/5. (4) Ruff, Band, and Cuff fol. 25 r -25 v This fair copy of the well known Jacobean dramatic dialogue follows more closely the second printed edition of 1615 (Folger exemplar of STC 1356) than the text printed by Park for the Harleian Miscellany X (1813), 200-203, from an unidentified copy (Park's text was rptd by C. Hindley in The Old Book Collector's Miscellany [1871], II). For instance, Cuff's last speech in Park starts: Then go before me to the next town] Folger Q: Then goe before to the next Tauern] Folger MS.: Then goe before me to the next Tauerne. Ruff, Band, and Cuff is a companion piece to the academic Work for Cutlers (1615), likewise printed by Park and Hindley in their anthologies cited above; and to the anonymous dialogue Wine, Beere, Ale, and Tobacco , printed in 1629 and 1630 ( STC 11541-11542), and reprinted by J.O. Halliwell in The Literature of the Sixteenth &amp; Seventeenth Century (1851), pp. 175-204. (5) Cancer fol. 26 r -47 r An anonymous Latin comedy adapted from the Italian comedy Il Granchio by Leonardo Salviati (Florence, 1566; 2nd ed. 1606; M. de Soleinne, Bibliothèque Dramatique , Paris, 1844, No. 4276; brief comment in Ireno Sanesi, La Commedia , Milan, 1954, I, 352-353. The Italian comedy, laid in Florence, tells how one Fortunio, who is ardently in love with Clarice (who never appears!), is denied her hand by her wealthy bourgeois step-father Vanni, in whose house the complicated action takes place. Fortunio consequently enlists the aid of his counsellor Granchio, her nurse Balia, and others, to join his beloved, at night, by forcing an entry into Vanni's house. Meanwhile a cowardly thief called Carpigna, aware of the stratagem, tries to take advantage of the situation and ply his trade, but he is apprehended almost immediately. Eventually, prodded by his steward Tofano, Vanni forgives the young lovers (Fortunio has turned out to be his long-lost son), and agrees to their union. They had inadvertently locked themselves in a vestibule, which necessitated the summoning of a locksmith called Magnano. (As Balia proclaimed [III, v]: "La Clarice s' è chiusa con Fortunio / Disauedamente nella camera / Della saracinesca, della quale / Solamente il padrone tien la chiaue.") This slight story provides occasion for a good deal of humor, especially in the saucy street-talk of the page-boy Fanticchio in his exchanges with the timid, sentimental nurse Balia: e.g. "Moccicone! Boccellone! Maccherone! Mestolone! che cose stempiate!" The Latin play Cancer was printed in 1648 along with the anonymous Cambridge academic Latin plays Paria, Loiola , and Stoicus Vapulans (see G.C. Moore Smith, College Plays performed in the University of Cambridge [1923], p. 99; Greg No. L-21). The printed text has a variant epilogue; and numerous minor differences. The play itself augments the text of the Italian original considerably, adding new characters such as the widow Ursilia and the monk Albertus that clutter the scene and retard the action. Also the anonymous author has little sense of colloquial speech, so needed in comedy: the easy Italian speech, natural, concrete, and evocative, say, of the cowardly thief Carpigna: "S'io veggo vn'ombra, io tremo / Com' vna foglia . . ." becomes in adaptation the abstract or "eloquent": "Mirum aedipol nos sumus genus hominum, quibus / Timor et audacia, suspitia et confidentia, semper comites" (III,iv). The author of Cancer evidently knew his Plautus: characteristic plautine terms of abuse such as furcifer, crux, verbero , appear; but he has not gone to the plautine school of colloquial speech with profit as did many renaissance writers (see Carl von Reinhardstoettner, Plautus: Spätere Bearbeitungen plautinisher Lustspiele , Leipzig, 1886), who understood that the vitality of comedy resides in immediate appeal to local and topical responses, which is one reason, no doubt, why it has always been so difficult to translate comedy with any degree of success. An interesting feature of the Folger MS. is the actor-list, written in darker ink by a contemporary hand after the dramatis personae, of the Trinity College, Cambridge, men who gave a performance of this play, the date of which, unfortunately, was not recorded. As indicated below a number of these men also acted in the plays of Samuel Brooke, whose Adelphe was produced in 1612, and whose Scyros in 1613 (see item No. 3 above). I subjoin tentative identifications of the Trinity men who acted in Cancer after the cast: asterisks are placed before the actors who also took part in one of Brooke's plays (see Bolton's ed. of Melanthe, op. cit. , pp. 202-205). Identifications are based on J. &amp; J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses (1922):- (1) Rodericus. senex. S r Faulcon. (2) Lucilius. Adolescens. M r Coote. (3) Corbus. seruus.

(1) * Faucon, Robert. m 1607; Fellow of Trinity, 1612-1621. (2) * Coote, Thomas m 1602, MA 1609; or William Coote m 1608, MA 1612 (this actor probably doubled as Albertus the monk; see No. 13 below). (3) * Goldfinch, Thomas, BA 1610, MA 1614. (4) * Chappell, John. Trinity scholar 1605, BA 1607, MA 1611. See Donald L.

AB 1605; Librarian of Trinity, 1609-1612. (15) * Wilson. A John Wilson, a George Wilson, a Timothy Wilson, m in 1609, 1608, and 1607 respectively. (16) Filmore. A Robert Filmore m 1604; an Edward Filmore m 1606. (A possible performance date of c 1610-1612 seems likely, negated only by the tentative identification of No. 5 above). (6) Preist the Barber fol. 47 v -48 r An anonymous (Cambridge?) dialogue or entertainment, between Preist, a barber and quack doctor, and his "little shaueling" apprentice appropriately named Sweetball (i.e., a pomander worn to ward off infection). N.b., Margaret G. Davies, The Enforcement of English Apprenticeship : 1563-1642 (1956). The barber, who stridently claims to have studied at the Sorbonne "in France," boasts at length of his rare skill in such matters as setting the broken bones of frolicsome undergraduates, curing a woman distended with the "collick" with "neatsfoot oyle," while giving his apprentice careful instructions as to how to provide therapy for future patients. This skit exploits the durable comic figure of the quack doctor, and, by obvious implication, the gulls who patronize him. Sweetball speaks the following epilogue to the audience: Yee had a Bason, y ett there's no man washt, Wee gaue no water least wee should bee dasht: Yett water for yo r hands wee'le nott denie They beeing wett, wee hope you'le clapp them drye. This piece is reasonably amusing, and could bear publication. (7) Gowne, Hood, and Capp fol. 43 v -49 r An anonmous English dialogue or entertainment wherein Capp, who has been off playing football, agrees, with mixed feelings, to serve as moderator in an ensuing debate for precedence between Hood and Gowne. For Cambridge regulations as to proper academic attire, see J. B. Mullinger, The University of Cambridge from the Royal Injunctions of 1535 to the Accession of Charles the First (1884), esp., pp. 389-390. See also John Cleveland, "The Ballad of the Caps," in F. W. Fairholt, Satirical Songs &amp; Poems on Costume , Percy Society Publications, XXVII (1849), 115-121. Capp speaks the following epilogue: Our Author bids mee say for's Gowne, and Hood, It is the Taylours fault, they are not good But howso'ere for feare of wors mishapp Hee lowly craues a Pardon w th his Capp. This piece is of the same genre as Ruff, Band, and Cuff , mentioned previously; and is considerably duller. It is not worth publishing. (8) fol. 50 v -79 v A Latin version of Spenser's Shepherdes Calendar entitled: Kalendarium Pastorale, seu Spenceri Pastor, Romano indutus centenculo. Authorship attributed in the MS. to Magister Batters (i.e., Theodore Bathurst, Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, 1608; see DNB ). This Folger copy was apparently not known to Leicester Bradner when he wrote, "The Latin Translations of Spenser's Shepherdes Calendar ," MP , XXXIII (1935), 21-26. Bathurst's translation was published posthumously in 1653: for an analysis of this text, see F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser (1933), pp. 8-10. Sir Egerton Brydges in 1815 reprinted short extracts from the 1653 text in his Censura Literaria , III, 179-193. (9) fol. 80 r-v Latin comments on the quodlibets: Vnum peccatum potest remittj sine altero; Quae fuerunt voluntatis in Christo (Humana an Diuina). MS. marginal attribution of authors (or speakers): Dr. Dauenett, Mr. Brittaine, Bac. Theol.; possibly John Davenaunt, B.D. 1606, and President of Queens' College, Cambridge, from 1614-1621; and Lawrence Bretton, also of Queens', B.D. 1615. (10) The Parliament Fart fol. 81 r -82 r The Folger fair copy of this popular anonymous anti-puritan doggerel poem of 68 ll., differs considerably from the text printed in Musarum Deliciae (1655: Wing M-1710), and in the 1662 edition of Rump (see A. R. Case, A Bibliography of English Poetical Miscellanies [1935], No. 128 [c]), a collection of largely anonymous pro-royalist political verse written between 1620-1650. The last 14 lines in the Folger copy are written in a different hand after an excised page (conjugate with fol. 79). (11) fol. 82 r An unsigned anti-French political couplet, with a probable jibe at Pierre Cotton (1564-1626), Jesuit confessor to Henri IV: Voulez vou scauoir qui a trouble la France[?] La Plume, &amp; la cere, La Cotton, &amp; L'Amore. (12) fol. 82 v -84 r An anonymous Latin topical outline of a Christian scheme of creation and ordering of the physical and moral universe, entitled Synopsis Physicae Christianae , with such subdivisions as: III, iii,i,2: De øιλανθρα i ια diuina erga nos. (13) fol. 84 v -85 r dated 1617 in MS. A fair copy of fifty charges made against Roger Brierly (1586-1637), presumably when he was curate of Grindleton Chapel, in the parish of Mitton in Craven (see DNB ), which served as the basis for his condemnation for lack of orthodoxy by the Bishop of York in 1628 (hence the MS. dating must be in error). E.g., No. 26: That a sanctified minister can preach no errour. The title runs: Certayne erronjous proceedings, gathered from y e mouth of Mr. Brierly, &amp; some of his hearers. (14) fol. 85 v Latin comments on the quodlibet: Ignorantia non excusat peccatum, attributed in the MS. to Dr. Dauenett (see No. 9 above). (15) fol. 86 r A short Latin theological treatise entitled De Meritis , attributed likewise in the MS. to Dr. Dauenett. There was considerable interest in the various and competing doctrines of divine grace in the seventeenth century; see L. Billot, De Gratia Christi , (Rome, 1928), pp. 224 ff.; J. Schwane, Dogmengeschichte der Neueren Zeit (Freiburg i. B., 1890), pp. 230 ff. (16 a) fol. 86 v -87 r A fair copy of Sir Walter Raleigh's last letter to his wife; see The Works of Sir Walter Raleigh (1829), VIII, 648-650. (16 b) fol. 87 r A fair copy of Raleigh's poem: "Euen such is Time w ch takes in trust/," which has the following substantive variants from the version printed as No. 40 by Miss Agnes M.C. Latham in her new edition of Raleigh's poems (1951), p. 72: 1.2, L reads our Ioyes; F reads &amp; life; 1.3, L reads And payes vs butt with age and dust:/ F reads And payes vs nought butt, age and dust,/ 1.6, L reads the storye; F reads y e Period. In her discussion of this poem, Miss Latham (p. 154) does not refer to this particular Folger text, although she does mention other Folger texts which she has consulted. (17) fol. 87 r An unsigned Latin epigram which reads as follows: Conde iura coquus, quid ni ? condire peritus Jura coquus, sed non condere iura coquus. Construe: "Draw up laws, cook, why not ? A cook is skilled In seasoning sauces, not in drawing up laws." (Properly, the first instance of coquus should be in the vocative case. Since I hesitate to call this epigram anonymous, I have made a cursory examination of at least a dozen collections of epigrams, such as Wits Recreations of 1640 which contains 902 items, but to date I have failed to establish authorship.) (18) fol. 87 v dated 1626 in MS. An order of Pennance enioyned to Mathew Hodson of Hitchin: &amp; by him to bee perfourmed as followeth . . . Signed by one "Ja. Rolfe," and dated at Whethamsted, 3 August, 1626. (19) fol. 88 r-v Anonymous Latin theological comments and scribblings.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Scottish Printers and Booksellers 1668-1775: A Supplement by Robert Hay Carnie and Ronald Paterson Doig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In their excellent Dictionaries of the British book trade from 1668 to 1775 H. R. Plomer and G. H. Bushnell have provided reliable reference books for all students. Such sturdy foundations can be built upon, however, by the use of sources of information not previously examined or considered relevant. This was abundantly proved by John Alden in his article 'Pills and Publishing: Some Notes on the English Book Trade, 1660-1715'. 1 The new sources of information which he used were the advertisements for medicines and nostrums which once formed an important part of booksellers' wares. The present article provides information about Scottish printers and booksellers from 1668 to 1775, supplemental to that in the Dictionaries. Four sources of new material were utilised: the business papers of a prominent Edinburgh bookseller; an account-book of a University library; the local collection formed by a 19th-century bibliophile, and the much read books of a public library of a small Scottish town. Any synthesis into a single list of information derived from such diverse sources obviously requires some preliminary account of their nature and scope. The first source was the papers of Thomas Ruddiman (1674-1757), printer, controversialist and Keeper of the Advocates' Library. 2 One volume (MS 762) contains a number of inventories of the wealth and possessions of Ruddiman. Amongst the assets are lists of debts owing to Ruddiman which contain the names of a large number of booksellers who bought books from him — alongside customers who were not engaged in the trade. We quote one of these lists as a specimen: List of Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman Keeper of the Advocates Library contain'd in his Leger for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736.

After 1739 Ruddiman ceased to list debts for books as these were marked in his ledger (note on MS p. 21). The Inventories continue down to 1750, however, and there are one or two further references to booksellers in connection with bonds, and 'bills and tickets'. A second Ruddiman volume (MS 763) has provided less information for the present study, but would be of very considerable interest to a student of Ruddiman as a printer. It is a ledger book containing, on the left-hand pages, weekly lists of printing expenses and other disbursements from 1712 onwards. These detail the printing tasks on which Ruddiman was engaged. In the case of large works, the signatures of the sections printed in the week in question are usually given. The right-hand pages contain notes of receipts but many are blank. One such page is filled with 'Debts for Books sold by Thomas Ruddiman this 19 May 1736'. This duplicates in the main the list already given but there are some discrepancies. 3 Also in this volume are statements of agreements between Thomas Ruddiman, his brother Walter and Robert Fleming in 1723, (fol. 132) and between Thomas Ruddiman and Robert Freebairn in 1736 (fol. 72). They reveal that Ruddiman's business associations were more complex than has hitherto been recorded. The General Book of Disbursements of Edinburgh University Library was the second source used. It was started in 1693 but unfortunately continues only until 1719. A MS of 43 pages, it contains detailed statements of accounts paid for books and MSS for binding, for freight, for postage and for shelving, along with some miscellaneous purchases of pictures and other objects. Such items as drink-money for servants and the cost of new scales and weights to guard against light money are all faithfully recorded as having been disbursed. Perhaps the most mysterious entry of all is one in the year 1696 where fourpence was expended 'for carying over a Greenland Boat' (MS p. 7). In the first three or four years the Disbursements book was also used as a receipt book and booksellers appended their signatures to paid accounts. But this practice is not continued. An example of a set of more typical entries follows: (MS p. 21). 13 July 1703 pd then to Mr David freebairn Bookseller for Lamy his concordantia del harmonia Evangelica 4to.Tit. 15 00- 0 to Geo. Mosman for Kennets lives of ye greek poets 8vo 03-00 -0 to John Vallange for Tillotsons posthumous sermons 9. 10. 11. 12 14-00 -0 The Disbursement book reveals that the library bought books from private individuals as well as from the booksellers and that various people were commissioned to buy books on its behalf at auctions. There are also records of purchases from London and from Holland. This valuable record was not restarted until 1762 and in the later lists no booksellers' names are given. 4 The third source is of a different nature altogether. It deals specifically with the printing and publishing activities of Dundee, the Scottish seaport city, and consists both of books and of secondary MS material. A. C. Lamb, a Dundee bibliophile, gifted his large collection of books of local interest to the city library. The collection was used by a Dundee journalist, T. Y. Miller, in his investigations of Dundee printers and booksellers and he in turn gave to the library his MS papers dealing with the subject. Two points should be noticed about the Lamb collection and the T. Y. Miller MSS. They carry our knowledge of Dundee publishing up to the end of the 19th Century and thus the bulk of the material they contain is untouched here. Secondly, Miller published two short journalistic accounts of Dundee printing and bookselling. 5 Neither of these is comparable to his MS papers either for completeness or accuracy. The writers of this paper felt that it would be valuable if the material derived from the above three sources could be supplemented — and in some cases corroborated—from the imprints and colophons of actual copies of books published within their period. They decided to examine a small collection from this point of view. It seemed unwise to comb the collections of a big University Library, for it would be almost inevitable that much of the work would merely repeat Plomer and Bushnell. Accordingly the fourth source of information chosen was the collection of books formerly belonging to the now defunct McIntosh Public Library of Dunkeld in Perthshire. 6 Its inaccessibility made it unlikely that it had ever been systematically examined by any historian of the book trade. The books numbered roughly 2000 and belonged to the period 1680 to 1830. A large proportion of them, including a rather impressive collection of early 18th Century pamphlets printed in London, lay outside the scope of this investigation. But the residue was significant and it is noteworthy that although the MS sources used were of very considerable interest they provided much less material than the McIntosh collection. The McIntosh Library had its origin in a collection of books donated in 1811 by the Rev. Donald McIntosh, a priest of the Scottish Episcopal Church and one of the last of the non-jurant clergymen. 7 The third and fourth of these sources were by far the easier to handle and presented no great problems of interpretation. But the two primary manuscript sources had to be used with considerable care in view of the aims of the investigation, which were :- 1. To record the names, place of business and limits of activity of booksellers and printers NOT previously recorded by Bushnell and Plomer. Such additional entries followed the pattern of a normal Dictionary entry. Forty new names were found and listed. 8 2. To supplement existing entries in the Dictionaries and to correct any errors noted. Such supplementation was confined to detail normally found in a Dictionary entry, and can be summarised as follows. (a) Extension of known dates of activity. (b) Extension of previous knowledge of type of activity. If, for example, a man was previously known as a bookseller, evidence that he was also a bookbinder was noted. (c) Addresses and places of business previously unrecorded. (d) Evidence of partnerships and contracts with other booksellers and publishers. Where new names are included from the two primary MS sources it has been done only where the person concerned is described as a bookseller, stationer etc. Occasionally there is confirmation from another source that a person not so described was in fact a bookseller. For example, George Paton of Linlithgow appears in Ruddiman's lists without any indication of his profession, but we know he was, from the imprint of an examined book. It would be tempting in many cases to assume that a person who owed Ruddiman money or who sold books to Edinburgh University Library was a professional bookseller, but never safe to do so. "Alexdr Mc Ulloch, Archbedel of St. Andrews", in the Ruddiman list quoted is a case in point. One of his successors in the post of Archbeadle to the University, Patrick Bower, is known to have also been bookseller to the University. 9 And we know there was a Wm McCulloch, Archbeadle of St. Andrews, who acted in 1738 as the agent appointed by the University to receive on their behalf the copyright books to which it was entitled from the Keeper of Stationers Hall. 10 Ruddiman himself was a University agent for the receipt of copyright books. But the evidence is not conclusive. The University disbursement book material has the added difficulty that the city in which the bookseller operated is not given. Edinburgh would be the natural place and this can be confirmed for many of the names. But in the case of one or two it has been assumed. The assumption is indicated in the lists. Some additional material from other sources has been added and in these cases the locus of the book or MS examined has been given in the actual entry. There are 70 entries supplying supplementary material which added to the 40 new entries give a total of 110.</field>

Was printing in 1716, one year earlier than recorded by Plomer. In 1719 he was at the Sign of the Printing Press in the North-West Corner of the Parliament Close, an intermediate address between the two given by Plomer. He was still printing in 1729, which extends the limits of his activities by four years. Canons and Constitutions Ecclesiastical. Gathered and put in Form, for the Government of the Church of Scotland . . . Aberdeen Printed in the Year 1636: Reprinted at Edinburgh by William Adams Junior, Anno 1716. and Sold at the Printing-House opposite to the Trone Church .

(Reprinted in Maitland, Scotish Elegiac Verses , p. 255). *ANGUS (DAVID), bookbinder (or bookseller?) in Aberdeen (no entry in Bushnell). Entry in "Note of Debts due to Mr Thomas Ruddiman for School Books sold since 1st January 1739 to 15 Decr sd year"; "Dav. Angus Bookr Aberdeen 4 17 10" (N.L.S. MS 762). Possibly related to Alexander and Andrew Angus (Bushnell p. 279). *ARMSTRONG (ARTHUR), bookseller in Kelso (no entry in Bushnell). His name appears in the "List of Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736" (N.L.S. MS 762). ARMSTRONG (MOSTYN JOHN), (?) publisher in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 280, where Christian names wrongly given as MARTYN JOHN, following Kay's Portraits ). Armstrong published a "Scots Atlas" which was dismissed as worthless by Gough, British Topography , London, 1780, vol. II, p. 588. Gough's criticism was based on information supplied by George Paton (q.v. below), and both Gough and Paton received angry letters from Armstrong on the subject. These are printed in Letters from Joseph Ritson, Esq. to Mr George Paton . . . , Edinburgh, 1829, pp. viii-xi. Armstrong is perhaps more properly regarded as an English publisher. (He is not included in the English section of the Dictionary of The Printers and Booksellers . . . 1726 to 1775 .) He published An Actual Survey of the Great Post-Roads between London and Edinburgh, By Mostyn John Armstrong, Geor. London Printed for, and Sold by the Author and the Booksellers . . . Published according to Act of Parliament 1st of June 1776 . (Dedication to Thomas Pennant, dated 1st August 1776. Copy in N.L.S., press-mark L.C. 951.) BAIN, BAINE (JOHN) type-founder in St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dublin, and Philadelphia, U.S.A., 1742-90 (?) (Bushnell p. 371). For evidence that he was in business in Edinburgh in 1780, and that BAIN (JOHN), type-founder in Edinburgh, 1773-4, (Bushnell p. 281) was probably the same man and not his son, see R. P. Doig, "A Note on John Baine", Transactions of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , III, pt. 3, (1956), 222. BALFOUR (JOHN), bookseller and printer in Edinburgh, c. 1745-95 (Bushnell p. 281). Was in partnership in 1777 with a Drummond, possibly William Drummond (Bushnell p. 302). An Answer to a late Inquiry into the Powers of Ecclesiastics, &amp;c. . . . London: Sold by T. Cadell, in the Strand: Balfour and Drummond, Edinburgh: and by Angus and Sons, and A. Thomson, Aberdeen. MDCCLXXVII . (McIntosh) BARRY (JOHN), bookseller and publisher in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 282). Bought books to the value of £4 from Thomas Ruddiman between 1st January and 20th May 1736. This indicates that he was in business as a bookseller eight years earlier than previously recorded. His name appears again in "Note of Debts due to Mr Thomas Ruddiman for School Books sold since 1st January 1739 to 15 Decr sd year". (N.L.S. MS 762) Presumably the Barry mentioned on the title-page of Patrick's Consolatory Discourses , quoted below under GORDON (WILLIAM). BAXTER (DANIEL), bookseller in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 282). Was in business in 1752, two years later than hitherto recorded, and his address was "in the Saltmercat". The Free-Holder, or, Political Essays. By . . . Joseph Addison, Esq. The Eighth Edition. Glasgow: Printed by J. Bryce, and D. Paterson, For D. Baxter, Bookseller, in the Saltmercat. MDCCLII (McIntosh). BECK (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Perth (Bushnell p. 282). As his name appears in "List of Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceding 1 Janry 1736", was in business at least three years earlier than previously recorded, and was definitely a bookseller, and not just a 'glazier and stationer' (N.L.S. MS 762). BELL (JOHN), bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh, c. 1760-1806 (Bushnell pp. 282-3). Bushnell gives his addresses as Addison's Head, 1773; Writer's Court, 1773-4. The following title-page suggests that he had both premises simultaneously. [C.] MacLaurin, Arguments and Decisions. . . Before the High Court of Justiciary, . . . in Scotland. Edinburgh: Printed for J. Bell, at Addison's Head, Edinburgh. And E. &amp; C. Dilly, in the Poultry, London. MDCCLXXIV McIntosh). BISSET (JOHN), bookseller in Perth, 1772-94 (Bushnell p. 284). His name appears in the following title-page of a book printed at Perth, which is of some interest as Bushnell records his name in the title-page of a book printed at Edinburgh. The Rudiments of the English Tongue: or a Plain and easy Introduction to English Grammar . . . Perth: Printed for the Author, by G. Johnston; and sold by Messrs. J. Bisset, and R. Morison, Booksellers MDCCLXXII (S.P.L.). *BLAIR (MRS. ), possibly bookseller in Edinburgh (no entry in Plomer). On 28th July 1711, John Goodall, Professor of Hebrew, bought books for Edinburgh University Library from Mrs. Blair, widow. There is an earlier note to the effect that some books were bound by Mr. Blair's widow's servant (D. Book). BRIGGS or BRIDGES (JOHN), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 285). Was in business in 1726, a year earlier than previously recorded. Gospel Sonnets: or, Spiritual Songs. In Six Parts. Edinburgh, Printed for John Briggs. 1726 (Copy in N.L.S. Cf. S.L.C.). BROWN (JAMES), bookseller and printer in Glasgow (Bushnell pp. 286-7, entries under BROWN (JAMES) and BROWN (JOHN) ). His name appears in "List of Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736" (N.L.S. MS 762). This is worth recording on account of the complicated business connections of John and James Brown. BROWN (WILLIAM), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh (Plomer p. 54). Was in business sixteen years earlier than previously recorded. The following entry occurs in E.U.L. D. Book for 21st July 1698; "To Wm Broun Stationer for Rawleigh's Hist abridged". There are further references to Brown in 1699 and 1700. His name appears on the following title-page of 1705; Collections concerning the Scottish history . . . By Sir James Dalrymple, Bar. Edinburgh, Printed by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer to the Queen's most Excellent Majesty; And are to be sold by William Brown Bookseller, M.DCC.V (McIntosh). BRYCE (JOHN), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, c. 1750-1786 (Bushnell pp. 287-8). In partnership with David Paterson in 1752, three years earlier than previously recorded. See title-page of Addison's Free-Holder , quoted above, under BAXTER (DANIEL). *BUCHANAN (GEORGE), bookbinder in Edinburgh (no entry in Bushnell). Bought school-books from Ruddiman between 1st January and 15th December 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). CANT (JAMES), bookseller and publisher in Dunkeld (Bushnell p. 289). There is a manuscript letter (Q.C.L. Rorie Collection) from the Glassite Church at Perth signed by four elders including Robert Morison, bookseller, agreeing that James Cant should be transferred to Dunkeld at the call of the Glassite elders there. Cant in the letter agrees to go. It therefore seems unlikely that he would be in business there before the date of this letter which is 26th April 1779. (Bushnell gives c. 1770.) CARRUTHERS (THOMAS), bookseller in Edinburgh (Plomer p. 65). The entry "paid To Caruthers Bookseller ye Accompts" occurs in E.U.L. D. Book for 1704. Assuming that this is Thomas Carruthers, it extends his period of activity by four years. *CHALMERS (LAURENCE), printer and bookseller in Dundee (no entry in Bushnell). In business in the Kirk Wynd from 1770 to 1775 at least. Said to have joined the staff of the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury , and to have remained on it thiry years (T.Y.M. MSS). See also under OGILVIE (DAVID) below. A Practical Essay on the Lord's Prayer by John Handasyde. Dundee: Printed by Lawrence Chalmers. 1770 . (A.C. Lamb Collection D.P.L.)

Memoirs concerning The ancient Alliance between The French and Scots . . . Edinburgh, Printed by W. Cheyne, and sold by W. Gordon, and other Booksellers in Town. MDCCLI (McIntosh). COLVILLE (THOMAS), printer and publisher in Dundee, c. 1770-1819 (Bushnell pp. 294-5). According to T. Y. Miller's Account of The Printing Art in Dundee published in 1896 as a private pamphlet by W. Kidd &amp; Sons, Colville's premises were in (1) Church Lane (2) Bisset's Close, Overgate (3) King's Close, off Nethergate. The first should presumably be Kirk Wynd. Cf. T.Y.M. MSS and the following title-page: Rev. Dr. Hastings, The Crown and Glory of Christianity . . . Dundee: Printed and sold in the Kirk Wynd. 1783 (A.C. Lamb collection D.P.L.). *COSH (CHARLES), bookbinder in Edinburgh (no entry in Plomer). In 1717 Edinburgh University library "pd more to charles cosh for making two large leathern covers for caesars comentaries printed be Tonson &amp; Dr Hamands Annotations on ye New Testament. to [i.e. ditto] for binding two Quarto's . . ." (D. Book). CRAWFORD, CRAWFURD (GIDEON), bookbinder and bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 295). May have been in business at least till 1750, one year later than suggested by Bushnell. "Two Bills of Gideon Crawford Bookseller" amounting to £68.4.6, are entered in Ruddiman's "Inventary 15th May 1750" (N.L.S. MS 762). DARLING (WILLIAM), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh, 1767-82 (Bushnell p. 297). In 1771 was in partnership as printer and publisher with Willison, presumably David Willison (Bushnell p. 366). Remained at Bridge Street address at least until 1776, two years later than hitherto recorded. The History and Adventures of Gil Blas of Santillane. In Four Volumes. Volume IV. Edinburgh: Printed for and by Willison &amp; Darling. MDCCLXXI (McIntosh). The Evidence of the Christian Religion. by Joseph Addison. A New Edition. Printed for William Darling, Bridgestreet. MDCCLXXVI (McIntosh). DAVIDSON (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1720-34 (Bushnell p. 297). Had a shop in Parliament-House as early as 1721 (Bushnell gives 1734). Another address given for him in 1724 is "at Virgil's Head, a little below the Cross, South-side of the Street". May have been in partnership with John Trail in 1736. See below under TRAILL (JOHN). On the Death of Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, Bart. Edinburgh; Printed and sold by Alexander Davidson, at his shop in Parliament-House. 1721 (Maidment, Scotish Elegiac Verses , p. 231). An Habbyac on the Death of Allan Ramsay. Edinburgh Printed for Alexander Davidson at Virgil's Head, a little below the Cross, South-side of the Street (n.d. McIntosh copy dated 1724 in MS). DEANS (HUGH), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 298). Bought books from Ruddiman between 1st January and 20th May 1736 (N.L.S. MS 762). This gives a period of activity of at least ten years after his apprenticeship to William Brown, recorded by Bushnell. *DRUMMOND (MRS ), bookseller in Edinburgh (no entry in Bushnell). Possibly widow of Alexander Drummond (Bushnell p. 301) or William Drummond (Bushnell p. 302). At Ossian's Head, 1776-9. Although just outside our period, this entry has been included because of possible connection with Alexander or William Drummond. A Dialogue Between Philalethes and Benevolus . . . By Dr. Abernethy-Drummond. Edinburgh: Printed in the Year M, DCC,LXXVI. And Sold by J. Balfour; Drummond at Ossian's head; and other Booksellers (B.D.L. A ii 5).

Anderson Stirling . . . MDCCLXXIX (B.D.L.P. viii 2). DRUMMOND (GAVIN), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1728-48 (Bushnell p. 301). "Gavin Drummond Teacher of Book-keeping Edr" who on 20th May 1736 was due Ruddiman £6, a debt incurred on 2nd February 1734, may be the same as the bookseller (N.L.S. MS 762). See also under MONRO (WILLIAM) below. DRUMMOND (WILLIAM), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 302). See under BALFOUR (JOHN), DRUMMOND (MRS ), MONRO (WILLIAM). DUNCAN (JAMES), senior, printer in Glasgow, 1717-c.1754 (Plomer p. 108, Bushnell p. 303). Was a bookseller as well as printer. The Cherrie and the Slae. Compyled into Meeter, By Captain Alexander Montgomery. Glasgow, Printed by James Duncan, and are to be sold at his Shop in the Salt-mercat, near Gibson's-Wynd. 1725 (B.D.L. P viii 17). DUNCAN (WILLIAM), printer in Glasgow, 1717-65 (Plomer p. 108, Bushnell p. 303). Like James Duncan, referred to above, was a bookseller as well as printer. He bought books worth £1.19.6 from Ruddiman between 1st January and 20th May 1736 (N.L.S. MS 762). *DUNCAN (W.), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1766 (no entry in Bushnell). The History of Scotland, from The earliest Accounts of that Nation, to the Reign of King James VI. Translated from the Latin of George Buchanan. In Two Volumes . . . The Sixth Edition. Edinburgh: Printed for W. Duncan, and R. Clark, Booksellers. MDCCLXVI (Q.C.L. U 941 B 918). DUNING, DUNNING (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 303). Entries in Ruddiman's mss extend Duning's period of activity by thirteen years, to 1739. On 2nd May 1735 he incurred a debt of £2.1.3, recorded as unpaid on 20th May 1736. It remained unpaid in October 1739, when Ruddiman added 8/3 for "4 years &amp;c.mmat; rent [annual rent, i.e. interest] thereof". Duning bought school books to the value of £1.6.6 from Ruddiman between 1st January and 15th December 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). ELLIOT (CHARLES), bookseller and publisher, Edinburgh and London, 1770-90 (Bushnell p. 304). His Edinburgh shop was in Parliament Square for the period 1776-86 at least (recorded by Bushnell only for 1777). The unpublished correspondence of George Paton (q.v. below) and Richard Gough (N.L.S. Adv. MSS 29.5.6-7 4 vols.) indicates that the long-awaited opening of Elliot's London shop was in April 1787, and not "in or about 1784". James Mackenzie, a young man described as Elliot's partner, was sent from Edinburgh to open the London shop. Early in 1788 Mackenzie left Elliot, having quarrelled with Elliot's other partner, T. Kay (Elliot's brother-in-law?), and obtained a post as clerk with John Murray, bookseller, 32 Fleet Street. The Orator.

Due Ruddiman £1.6.7 on 19th May 1736 for books purchased (N.L.S. MS 763). FLEMING (ROBERT), printer in Edinburgh (Plomer p. 118, Bushnell p. 306). N.L.S. MS 763 contains a record of the dissolution of partnership between Fleming, and Thomas and Walter Ruddiman, as follows: " 23 May 1723. The said day cleared all Accompts betwixt Robert Fleming &amp; me, with Respect to the Copartnery betwixt him, my Brother Walter &amp; me (which expired at Whitsunday last) . . .

His name appears in the imprint of two books published in 1712, as noted below. The following entry is in Ruddiman's printing account book (N.L.S. MS 763) for week ending 26th June 1714: "Letter B &amp; C of Mr Dav Freebairn's Catalogue press 300 copies [£]1 8[s]". There are similar entries for letters D &amp; E (3rd July 1714) and F (10th July 1714). May have been related to Robert Freebairn (q.v. below). Tippermalluch's Receits . . . John Moncreif. Edinburgh printed: and sold by Henry Knox, David Freebairn and James Simpson. 1712 (S.L.C. p. 152. Copy in G.U.L.). A Genealogical and Historical Account of The Illustrious Name of Stuart . . . David Symson. Edinburgh, Printed for Mr. David Freebairn and Mr. Henry Knox. MDCCXII (McIntosh). FREEBAIRN (ROBERT), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh (Plomer pp. 121-2, Bushnell p. 308). Was in business as bookseller in 1701, four years earlier than hitherto recorded. On 29th October 1701 Edinburgh University Library "pd to Mr Ro. freebairn Merchant the sume of ten pounds sterling &amp; 6 shillings &amp; 8 pence viz. for these books. . ." (D. Book). There are confirmatory entries for 31st December 1701, 9th February 1702, 28th April 1702 and 28th February 1704. For a period prior to 1736 he was in partnership with Thomas Ruddiman. N.L.S. MS 763 contains a "State of Affairs 'twixt Mr Robert Freebairn &amp; Mr Thomas Ruddiman". There is a list of amounts due to them and of books in their possession, and it is stated that "The one half of all which Books and Debts Belongs to the Said Mr Freebairn". *GAINES (DANIEL), printer in Dundee (no entry in Plomer). In the Parochial Records of Foulis Easter for Sabbath April 18th, 1703: "Given out to Daniel Gaines to help him in setting up the art of printing in Dundee, by the Presbytery's recommendation £1.4/-" (Cf. James Thomson, History of Dundee (1846), pp. 249-252; T.Y.M. p. 305). No books printed by Gaines have come to notice. GALBRAITH (HENRY), printer and publisher in Dundee and Edinburgh (Bushnell pp. 308-9). T.Y.M. (p. 306) states that about 1772 Galbraith had an office at the Bull's Close, opposite the Tron Church, Edinburgh. This is confirmed by the entry in the Edinburgh Directory for 1773-4 quoted by Bushnell. It is not certain whether it was a branch office or whether the business had been transferred from Dundee. An earlier Dundee address is given in the following title-page: A Brief Account of some Lent and other Extraordinary Processions . . . by George Whitefield . Dundee, reprinted by H. Galbraith &amp; Co. and sold at their Printing House, near to the Main Guard . (A. C. Lamb collection D.P.L.) *GEDDES (JOHN), bookseller in Edinburgh (?) (no entry in Plomer). On 10th October 1699 Edinburgh University Library sold a book "to Jo: Geddes Bookseller viz. Xenophon in Greek &amp; Lat. qc had been borrowed by Mr. Cuningham &amp; lost &amp; ye Library mark battered up &amp; defaced" (D. Book). *GILLIES (JOHN), bookseller and bookbinder in Perth, 1774-1786 (no entry in Bushnell). The Life, surprising adventures and heroic Actions of Sir William Wallace . . . a new edition . Printed for John Gillies Bookbinder, High Street, Perth 1774 (S.P.L.). Chronicon Manniae, or a Chronicle of the Kings of Man . . . Perth: Printed for John Gillies, MDCCLXXXIV (S.P.L.) Allan Ramsay, The Gentle Shepherd . . . Printed by and for R. Morison and Son, Booksellers . Also for J. Gillies Perth; W. Coke Leith and G. Milne Dundee 1786 (B.M.). GLASS (THOMAS), bookseller in Dundee (Bushnell p. 311). In business in 1749, one year earlier than previously recorded, when he sold Christian Songs (for the use of Glasite congregations) . (A. C. Lamb Collection D.P.L. See A. H. Miller, Glimpses of Old and New Dundee , (1925.) GORDON (WILLIAM), bookseller in Edinburgh, c. 1743-94 (Bushnell, p. 312). Apparently in partnership with Alexander Symmer (q.v. below) in 1744. But it should be noted that this inference depends on the punctuation of the imprint in the following title-page: Symon Patrick, D.D. late lord Bishop of Ely; Four Consolatory Discourses . . . (9th edition. Edinburgh, Printed for A. Symmer and W. Gordon, and W. Drummond; sold by them and other Booksellers there; by Messrs Strahan, Hitch, Innys and Manby, J. and P. Knapton, Ward, Longman, Astley, Wicksteed, Oswald, Davidson, Rivington and Beecroft at London; J. Smith, Dublin; Brysson, Newcastle, and Barry at Glasgow . M.DCC.XLIV (McIntosh). GRAY (WILLIAM), bookbinder in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 314). His name appears in the "List of Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736". This places him at least four years earlier than previously recorded. The debt remained unpaid in 1739, and in that year he also bought school books from Ruddiman (N.L.S. MS 762). GRAY (WILLIAM), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 315). Was also a printer, and was in business in 1748, one year earlier than hitherto recorded. A Memorial for the Reformation (chiefly in England) by Benjamin Bennet . Edinburgh: Printed by William Gray and sold at his House, at Magdalene's Chappel, within the Cowgate Head; and by John Barrie, Bookseller in Glasgoe, and the Booksellers in Edinburgh and Perth . 1748 (McIntosh). *HALL (JOHN), printer in Glasgow (no entry in Bushnell).

HAMILTON (WILLIAM), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell pp. 317-8). Still in business in 1739. Bought books from Ruddiman between 1st January and 20th May 1736, and school books between 1st January and 15th December 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). HERIOT (THOMAS), bookseller in Edinburgh 1724-40 (?) (Bushnell p. 318). Had shop in Parliament Close in 1726, two years earlier than previously recorded. The Index, or Abridgment of such Acts of the British Parliament . . . by Alexander Bruce Advocate .

Johnston, for James Ironside . M,DCC,LXXIV (S.P.L.). KNOX (JAMES), bookseller in Glasgow (Cf. entry KNOX ( ), printer in Glasgow, 1752 - Bushnell p. 323). The following title-page gives Bushnell's Knox a first name, if the same man, shows him to be a bookseller as well as printer, and extends his period of activity to 1767. Dialogorum Sacrorum libri quattuor Auctore Sebast . Castilione . Glasguae: Prostant apud Jacobum Knox Bibliopolam . M, DCC,LXVII (McIntosh). LESLIE ( ), bookseller in Edinburgh (?) (Cf. entries LESLIE (HENRY) and LESLY (GEORGE) - Plomer p. 188). "18 March [1698] pd to Mr Leslie for J. Evelyn's Discourse of Medals in folio Lond 97 ten pounds Scots" (E.U.L. D. Book). If this is either Henry Leslie or George Lesly, it extends the period of activity by twenty years. *LYON (GEORGE), bookseller in Dundee (no entry in Plomer or Bushnell). Said to have been admitted a burgess in 1717 (T.Y.M. MSS). Still in business in 1729. The Testimony of the King of Martyrs concerning his Kingdom . John Glas. Edinburgh, Printed; and sold by Mr. George Lyon, Bookseller in Dundee, and Others . 1729 (A. C. Lamb Collection. D.P.L.) *McALPIN (WALTER), bookbinder in Greenock (no entry in Bushnell). Bought schoolbooks from Ruddiman in 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). Perhaps related to William McAlpine, printer in Greenock (Bushnell p. 326). M'CALLUM (JOHN), printer in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 326). The following title gives M'Callum's Christian name, and extends the period of his activities by one year. An Example of Plain Catechising upon the Assembly's Shorter Catechism . . . by the Rev. John Willison, Minister of the Gospel at Dundee . Glasgow: Printed by John M'Callum, for John Orr Bookseller Saltmercat . 1752 (A. C. Lamb Collection D.P.L.). M'CASLAN (ALEXANDER), printer, bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 326). Was printing in 1769, two years earlier than hitherto recorded.

MDCCLXIX (McIntosh). MACKIE (JOHN), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1691-1722 (?) (Plomer p. 194). Also a bookbinder. Entry in E.U.L. D. Book for February 1695 -- "paid to John Mackye stationer for binding according to his Receipt'. *MACLEAN (MRS. ), bookseller (?) in Glasgow, 1736-9 (no entry in Bushnell). Her name appears several times in Ruddiman's accounts, and it is highly probable that she was a bookseller. Unfortunately, however, she is nowhere clearly described as such. In one place (N.L.S. MS 762 p. 20) "Mistriss Maclean Ibid" follows "And. Stalker Bookseller in Glasgow". This is inconclusive, since it is not clear whether 'ibid' refers to 'bookseller' or merely to 'in Glasgow', and further because the next entry is 'Baillie Gavin Hamilton Ibid.' which is a mistake as Hamilton was a bookseller in Edinburgh. *McMAIN (JOHN), publisher in Edinburgh (no entry in Plomer). Schoolmaster at foot of Liberton's Wynd, 1724. The Life and Death of that eminently Pious, Free and Faithful Minister and Martyr of Jesus Christ, Mr James Renwick: with a Vindication of the Heads of his Dying Testimony .

MDCCXXIV (Q.C.L. U922). MARSCHAL, MARSHALL (WILLIAM), bookseller in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 330). Was still in business in 1762, twelve years later than the end-date suggested by Bushnell. His shop was then in the Salt Market. The Balm of Gilead . By John Willison M.A. The Sixth Edition . Glasgow: Printed for William Marshall, Bookseller in the Saltmercat . MDCCLXII (A. C. Lamb Collection D.P.L.) MARTIN (ANDREW), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 330). Bought school books from Ruddiman in 1739, one year later than the last date recorded by Bushnell (N.L.S. MS 762). MARTIN (GILBERT), printer and publisher in Edinburgh, c. 1750-86. (Bushnell p. 330 -- see also under WOTHERSPOON (JOHN), Bushnell p. 369.) The Apollo Press, originally Martin and Wotherspoon, was by 1784 run by a partnership of two or more Martins. The Poetical Works of Samuel Butler in three Volumes . . . Bell's second edition . Vol. III. Edinburg : At the Apollo Press, by the Martins, Anno 1784 (McIntosh). *MARTIN (JOHN), bookseller in Melrose, 1769 (no entry in Bushnell). See title-page quoted above under M'CASLAN (ALEXANDER). MATHIE, MATTHIE (PATRICK), printer and publisher in Edinburgh, 1732-60(?) (Bushnell p. 331). In 1738 Mathie's printing-house was opposite the Tolbooth. Grave Dialogues Betwixt Three Free-Thinkers . . . Edinburgh, Printed by P. Matthie, sold at his printing-house opposite to the Tolbooth, North side of the street, and by most booksellers in town . MDCCXXXVIII (Q.C.L.

Lond. 1684 this 9 of february 1695 by me R. Merchistone" -- Receipt in E.U.L. D. Book. MEUROS (JAMES), bookseller in Kilmarnock (Bushnell p. 332). Was still in business in 1779, one year later than previously recorded. He is listed as a selling bookseller in the proposals at the end of Poems on the British Authors and Other Persons, eminent in their various professions . Glasgow: Printed by William Smith, for the Author; and sold by Booksellers in Town . 1779 (McIntosh). MILLAR, MILLER (WILLIAM), bookseller in Edinburgh 1730-74(?) (Bushnell p. 333). Bought books from Ruddiman 1736-9 (N.L.S. MS 762). His address in 1736 was "a little above the Cross". The Usefulness of Catechisms considered in a letter to a friend [John Glass] Edinburgh, printed in the year 1736 . And sold by W. Miller at his shop a little above the Cross, North side of the street (Q.C.L. Rorie Collection). *MITCHEL (ALEXANDER), bookbinder (or bookseller ?) in Perth (no entry in Bushnell). "Alexr Mitchel Bookr in Perth" is listed as owing £2.12.3 in "Debts for Books sold by Mr Thomas Ruddiman this 19 May 1736". (N.L.S. MS 763) *MONRO (WILLIAM), bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh 1733-9 (no entry in Bushnell). Ruddiman printed five volumes of Medical Essays for him in 1733-4, as noted below. Listed as owing £1.3.6 in "Debts owing to Mr Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736". By 1739 he was possibly in partnership with Gavin Drummond (q.v. above) or William Drummond (Bushnell p. 302). "Messrs Monro &amp; Drummond" appear in list of debtors to Ruddiman for books bought before 1st January 1739; and "Mess. Monro &amp; Drummond Ibid. [i.e. booksellers, Edinburgh]" bought school books from Ruddiman in 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). Medical Essays and Observations revised and published by a Society in Edinburgh . (Vols. I-V only published.) Edinburgh Printed by T. and W. Ruddiman for W. Monro . (1733-4). (Journal of the first Edinburgh Medical Society. Copy in G.U.L. Cf. S.L.C. p. 155.) *MORE (JAMES), bookseller in Dundee 1765-86 (no entry in Bushnell; but possibly the same as the Edinburgh bookseller of that name, Bushnell p. 335). According to T.Y.M. MSS, his name was entered on the Burgess Roll in 1765. Also in Dundee Register for 1783. The New Calculator, or Merchant and Weaver's Complete Assistant . Dundee. Printed, and sold by J. More and G. Milln Booksellers (1786) (D.P.L.). MOSMAN (GEORGE), bookseller and printer in Edinburgh (Plomer p. 212). Plomer suggests possible identity of George Mosman, merchant , and this George Mosman. But George Mosman, merchant , was a witness at the baptism on 10th July 1683 of Margaret, daughter of George Mosman, stationer (i.e. this George Mosman) (Edinburgh Register of Baptisms. H. M. Register House). Margaret Mosman married John Paton (q.v. below) who succeeded to the shop in Parliament Close, but not, apparently, to the printing side of the business (Edinburgh Marriage Register. H. M. Register House). George Mosman was a half-brother of Hugh Mosman (q.v. below). George Mosman's name appears frequently in E.U.L. D. Book, and it is there indicated that he was also a bookbinder. For example, with reference to books from Holland given in by Mr Cuninghame of Blooke, it is stated: "Most of ym were bound by George Mosman". *MOSMAN (HUGH), bookbinder in Edinburgh (no entry in Plomer or Bushnell). Witnessed baptism on 25th July 1721 of George Paton (q.v. below), son of John Paton (q.v. below) and Margaret Mosman (Edinburgh Register of Baptisms H.M. Register House). Bought school books from Ruddiman in 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). A letter from George Paton to James Cummyng, 13th July 1786 (E.U.L. Laing MSS II 81) states that he was the half-brother of George Mosman (q.v. above). George Mosman was the son of Hugh Mosman, Cooper and Wine Merchant, Leith, by his first wife, Barbara Murray. By his second wife, Betsey Balfour, Hugh the wine merchant had two sons, John (possibly the printer — see Plomer p. 212 and Bushnell p. 338) and Hugh the bookbinder. MURRAY (ALEXANDER), printer in Edinburgh 1734-81 (?) (Bushnell p. 339). The firm of Sands, Murray and Cochran lasted at least until 1753, one year later than noted by Bushnell. Bushnell states that possibly Murray was succeeded in the firm of Murray and Cochran by a son. This son might conceivably be James Murray, the printer of the second book noted below. An Essay to Prove That the feast of the Nativity of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, commonly called Christmas-Day, was known and observed in the primitive church . . . Edinburgh: Printed by Sands, Murray, and Cochran. Sold by W. Gordon, and other Booksellers. 1753 . (McIntosh) An Account of the Chapel of Roslin . . . A New Edition. Edinburgh: Printed by James Murray, Parliament-Square . M.DCC.LXXVIII (McIntosh). *NICOLL (ROBERT), bookseller in Dundee (no entry in Bushnell). In business in 1767 (T.Y.M. MSS). Appears in Dundee Register 1782-3 as bookseller along with James More (q.v. above), George Milne and James Stark (q.v. below). No evidence has been found as to when Milne commenced business, but the other three were all in business before 1775. Nicoll was the first to found an extensive circulating library in the city. There is a catalogue dated 1780. *OGILVIE (DAVID), printer and bookseller in Dundee (no entry in Bushnell, unless he is the same as the bookbinder in Edinburgh, 1763 — p. 342.) In partnership with Laurence Chalmers (q.v. above) in 1770. It seems probable that Chalmers took over from Ogilvie in that year after a short period of working together. (Cf. entry on Chalmers above.) A manuscript note on the first of the two books listed below states; "David Ogilvy while in London was a church member — he became unfortunate either there or in Dundee. He possessed that shop No 1 east from the Town House". Christian Songs (for the use of Glasite Congregations) . The Fourth Edition . Dundee: Printed by David Ogilvie, Bookseller . 1770 (T.Y.M. MSS. Copy in A. C. Lamb Collection D.P.L.). The Psalms of David in Metre . Dundee: Printed by D. Ogilvie &amp; L. Chalmers . 1770 (D.P.L.). *OGSTON (ALEXANDER), junior, bookseller in Edinburgh (no entry in Plomer). Son of Alexander Ogston, senior, (Plomer pp. 222-3) and Martha Ogston, afterwards Stevenson (Plomer p. 223). Apparently in partnership with his mother. "The 4th day of March 1707 Tuesday pd out to Alexander Ogstoun Bookseller son to Mrs Ogstoun the sume ninety-four pound three shillings &amp; ½ penny in payment of his account untill the nineteenth day of Aprile" (E.U.L. D. Book). There is another account for "Widow Ogston" paid to her son in the same year, and one in 1708. One is paid to Alexander Ogston in 1709. On 3rd March 1710 there is the entry: "full payment of all books bought from Mistress Ogstoun or her son Alexr the sum of seventy pounds Scots". On 18th June 1712 an account was paid to Mrs Ogston, which may indicate that her son was no longer in the business. *OGSTON (HUGH), bookseller in Edinburgh (?) (no entry in Plomer). Sold books to Edinburgh University Library in 1718. 4th April; "pd to H. Ogston for St Cyprians works . . . [etc.]"; "24 July 1718. Received fm Hugh Ogston the fifth &amp; sixt volumes of Souths Sermons . . ."; "Decr 25 1718 fra Hugh Ogstoun Annalls of King George the 4th volume . . ." (D. Book). OGSTON (MARTHA), see under OGSTON (ALEXANDER). PATERSON (DAVID), printer and bookseller in Glasgow 1755-9, and in Edinburgh 1760-c.1780 (Bushnell p. 343). In partnership with John Bryce in 1752, three years earlier than previously recorded. See title-page of Addison's Free-Holder , quoted above under BAXTER (DANIEL). PATON (GEORGE), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell pp. 343-4). Born 23rd June 1721 (Edinburgh Register of Baptisms, H. M. Register House). On 21st February 1762, he married Rosina, daughter of Rev. James Paton, minister of Primrose ( Edinburgh Marriage Register, 1751-1800 . Scottish Record Society). Died 6th March 1807, buried at Greyfriars Churchyard on 9th March (Record of Interments; Greyfriars, H. M. Register House. Date confirmed by Customs Records, also in Register House). Had no business connection with the bookselling, publishing or printing trades after he took up a clerkship in the Custom-house about 1760; but he retained an interest in bibliographical matters. See R. P. Doig, "George Paton's Contributions to Herbert's Typographical Antiquities", Transactions of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , III, pt. 3, (1956), 215-219. *PATON (GEORGE), bookseller in Linlithgow, 1736-41 (no entry in Bushnell; but cf. his entries PATON (GEORGE), printer in Glasgow, 1741-72 (?) and PATON (GEORGE), bookbinder in Edinburgh, 1753-74 — p. 344). "George Paton in Linlithgow" bought books value 3/10 from Ruddiman prior to 1st January 1736, while "Geo Paton in Lithgow [sic]" was due Ruddiman 8/6 for school books purchased in 1739. A Collection of several Remarkable and Valuable Sermons, Speeches and Exhortations, At Renewing and Subscribing the National Covenant of Scotland . . . Glasgow: Printed for George Paton, and are to be Sold at his Shop in Linlithgow, and other Booksellers in Town and Country . MDCCXLI (Q.C.L. U252). PATON (JOHN), bookseller and bookbinder in Edinburgh (Plomer p. 233, Bushnell p. 344). Probably the John Paton who was baptised on 4th February 1677, son of Baillie William Paton and Janet Reid (Edinburgh Register of Baptisms, H. M. Register House). Married the daughter of George Mosman (q.v. above). Died May 1765, although his will was not registered till 1781 (Record of Interments; Greyfriars. H. M. Register House). *PETER (W.), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1756-7 (no entry in Bushnell). A View of the Edinburgh Review pointing out the Spirit and Tendency of that Paper . Edinburgh: Printed in the year MDCCLVI . Sold by W. Sands, Gray and Peter, and other Booksellers (McIntosh). Douglas: A Tragedy . As it was acted at the Theatre-Royal in the Covent-Garden .

Written by the late Reverend and Learned Dr. Alexander Monro . Edinburgh: Printed for John Ramsay, and are to sold [sic] at his House, within the Foot of the College-Wynd . 1719 (McIntosh P.V. 4). RANDIE (DAVID), bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 345). Ruddiman's mss extend his period of activity to 1736 at least, a period of six years, and indicate that between 1736 and 1739 he became a merchant at Haddington. In the "List of Debts owing to Mr. Thomas Ruddiman . . . for Books sold by him preceeding 1 Janry 1736" Randie is listed as owing "about £8". On 20th May 1736 he was still owing Ruddiman £5.14/-, a debt incurred on 22nd September 1731. This last mentioned debt remained unpaid in October 1739, when Randie is described as "now Mert in Haddington" (N.L.S. MS 762). REID (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, c. 1758-75 (?) (Bushnell p. 346). His printing house was at Baillie Fyfe's Close in 1770, three years earlier than previously recorded. The Theatre licentious and perverted . Or a Sermon on the Reformation of Manners . . . By James Baine A.M. Edinburgh: Printed by J. Reid; and sold at his printing house in Bailie Fyfe's close, and by W. Gray, Front of the Exchange . 1770 (Q.C.L. Rorie Collection). *RICHARDSON (J.), printer in Edinburgh (no entry in Bushnell). In partnership with Walter Ruddiman, junior (Bushnell pp. 349-50), in 1765. Could possibly be the same as J. Richardson, bookseller and publisher in Paternoster Row, 1753-63 (Plomer, Dictionary 1726-75 p. 210). A Specimen of a Book intituled Ane Compendious Booke, of Godly and Spiritual Sangs . . . Edinburgh: Printed by W. Ruddiman, J. Richardson and Company . 1765 (S.P.L.). ROBERTSON (ALEXANDER), printer in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 347). An Alex. Robertson who was printing at Leith in 1766 is probably the same man. Was also a bookseller, his address in 1768 being Morison's Close. The same address is given in an undated book, the third of those given below. See also under WILSON (JOHN). The Lawfulness and Expediency of Set Forms and Prayer maintained . . . By the Rev. Mr Robert Calder . Leith: Printed by Alex Robertson . MDCCLXVI (McIntosh). A Letter to A Lady . Wherein the Nature and Necessity, of worshipping God in the Unity of the Church . . . is set forth . . . adapted to the meanest capacities . Edinburgh .

Robertson in Morison's Close; where Subscribers may call for their Copie (McIntosh). *ROBERTSON (JAMES), bookseller in Edinburgh (no entry in Bushnell). "Mr James Robertson Bookseller now Minir [i.e. minister] in Edr" appears in "Debts for Books sold by Mr Thomas Ruddiman this 19 May 1736" (N.L.S. MS 763). In MS 762 (quoted in the introduction above) he appears simply as "Mr James Robertson Minister in Edr". He was not, apparently, a minister of the Church of Scotland, as he cannot be traced in the Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae . ROBERTSON (JOHN), junior, bookseller and bookbinder in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 347). Bushnell gives no definite reference to him as a bookseller, but he is described as such in Ruddiman's lists of debts for books bought between 1st January and 20th May 1736, and for school books bought between 1st January and 15th December 1739 (N.L.S. MS 762). ROBERTSON (JOHN), senior, printer and bookseller in Glasgow (Bushnell p. 348 ?). In the Salt-Market, 1763. The first part of the edition of The Pilgrim's Progress cited below was printed by John Hall (q.v. above), so that Robertson was probably his successor. This Robertson can hardly be the John Robertson, senior, stationer in Glasgow, 1697-1728 (Bushnell p. 347). He is more likely to be the bookseller and printer, c 1730-(?) (Bushnell p. 348); but possibly he is neither. The Pilgrim's Progress . The Twentieth and First Edition . Part second . Glasgow: Printed by John Robertson, Senior, and sold at his Shop, Saltmercat. M,DCC,LXII (McIntosh). ROBERTSON (JOHN), printer and publisher in Edinburgh, c. 1760-90 (Bushnell p. 348). As Bushnell points out, he purchased the Ruddiman's printing-house and materials in 1772. The following imprint, in which he describes himself as their successor, as printer and bookseller, is interesting as supplementing this. See also under WILSON (JOHN). Alexander Pope: The Odyssey of Homer. Edinburgh: Printed and sold by J. Robertson, Successor to Tho. and Wal. Ruddiman.

There is a further account "begun January 1714 &amp; continued to 3d May 1715" (D. Book). In Ruddiman's ledger for Saturday 19th February 1715 "David Scot Bookseller" appears on page opposite "Orphan a Tragedy 2 sheets long Primar Case" (N.L.S. MS 763).

Miller, Glimpses of Old and New Dundee , he came to Dundee about 1740, having been a servant to Allan Ramsay in Edinburgh. This would give him a period of activity of twenty-six years. T.Y.M. MSS states that in 1751 he sold A Funeral Poem on the death of the Rev. James Johnston, late minister in the Associate Congregation of Dundee .

John Traill bought school books from Ruddiman in 1739, and in "Bills and Tickets owing to Mr Tho Ruddiman wt the Interest of some of them 13 Oct 1746" he is listed as owing £4 (N.L.S. MS 762). *TURNBULL (WILLIAM), bookseller (?) in Edinburgh (?) (no entry in Plomer). On 27th August 1694 Edinburgh University Library 'payed for these Books following to Wm Turnbull'.

The title-page of Josephus Redivivus , quoted above under VALLANGE (JOHN), shows Wilson was also a bookseller. WILSON (JOHN), bookseller in Edinburgh (Bushnell p. 368). Was in business in 1767, a year earlier than recorded hitherto, and the same book gives a date six years earlier for his Exchange premises. Bushnell (pp. 359, 366) refers to a firm of Wilson and Tenant (or Tennent). The second title-page quoted below gives Wilson, Robertson and Tennent. From the date, 1770, it would seem that the most likely partners are this John Wilson, Alexander Robertson (q.v. above) or John Robertson of Edinburgh (q.v. above), and John Tennent (Bushnell p. 359).

      <field name="heading_text">Blake's Engravings and his Friendship with Flaxman by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An ill-wisher once wrote that the "public reputation" of William Blake was largely "the reputation of eccentricity". 1 The libel had just enough truth in it to make it sting. Blake's professional success as an engraver depended on his securing the interest of the public or the enthusiasm of a publisher, and both tasks were conspicuously beyond his own unaided powers. His most ambitious undertakings, the illustrations to Young's Night Thoughts , Job and Dante, involving hundreds of drawings and engravings, were commercial failures. As a consequence, Blake depended very heavily upon his friends for his spiritual and physical well-being; from them he derived sporadic admiration and a relatively steady stream of commissions. Among the earliest of Blake's friends, and perhaps the most valuable, was John Flaxman, one of the greatest sculptors England has produced. For half a lifetime Flaxman found praise and patrons for his fiery friend, during the years when all Blake's greatest mature poetry was being written, from the Songs of Innocence to Jerusalem . Flaxman's bread-and-butter friendship was responsible for much of that margin of financial security Blake occasionally achieved, and for endless workaday commissions. Blake's gratitude for such practical help was shown in spiritual praise. In 1800 he wrote: You, O Dear Flaxman, are a Sublime Archangel, My Friend &amp; Companion from Eternity; in the Divine bosom in our Dwelling place. I look back into the regions of Reminiscence &amp; behold our ancient days before this Earth appear'd in its vegetated mortality to my mortal vegetated Eyes. I see our houses of Eternity, which can never be separated, tho' our Mortal vehicles should stand at the remotest corners of heaven from each other. 2 The friendship which inspired this enthusiasm was clearly a focal point in Blake's life; the record of that friendship is largely to be found in Flaxman's letters soliciting work for the engraver, and explaining his peculiarities to perplexed patrons. It is my purpose here to examine such records as have survived of the extent and effect of the relationship between William Blake and John Flaxman. Soon after his apprenticeship ended in 1779, Blake met Flaxman 3 and immediately struck up a friendship with the young man who was just two years his senior. Flaxman soon showed the quality of his friendship by introducing Blake to an early patroness of his, Mrs. Mathew, a blue-stocking of thoroughly Gothic inclinations. Mrs. Mathew moved with a group of what Blake called "the Cunning-sures &amp; the aim-at-yours", 4 and she encouraged ambitious young artists to come and perform at her literary evenings. Almost nothing is known of Mr. and Mrs. Mathew, but there can be no doubt that they had, in some respects, excellent taste and perception; in spite of Blake's continued indifference to the project, they with Flaxman introduced the poet to the public by printing his Poetical Sketches in 1783. 5 Though these scarcely made an impression for fifty years, they were, as Swinburne said, "not simply better than any man could do then; [but] better than all except the greatest have done since: better too than some still ranked among the greatest ever managed to do." 6 Few Cunning-sures have performed a greater service to literature. Flaxman remained on close terms with Mrs. Mathew and her husband for the rest of his life, and his letters are full of his gratitude to them. Within a year or two of the publication of his Poetical Sketches Blake became alienated from Mrs. Mathew's cosy conversaziones. The pattern thus established was to repeat itself over and over; Flaxman introduced Blake to people of taste and liberality, and the poet could not suppress his opinions or temper sufficiently to keep his hard won patrons. It seems likely that Blake's marriage may have influenced his disagreement with the Mathews. Flaxman had been courting a girl named Nancy Denman in the early 1780s, but Miss Denman's father had opposed her marriage to a penniless sculptor of obscure prospects; clearly he felt that Miss Denman would be marrying beneath her. However, with the help of Mrs. Mathew, Flaxman's courtship prospered, and on June 23rd 1782 he and Miss Denman were married. During these same years Blake was courting the illiterate daughter of a market gardner named Catherine Boucher, and a legend has survived that Blake's father was opposed to the match, perhaps on the ground that Blake would be marrying beneath him. Just eleven weeks after the Flaxman's marriage, on August 18th 1782 Blake and Catherine Boucher were married, the bride signing her name with an X. It seems reasonable to suppose that Catherine Blake would have made a most anomalous figure in the sophisticated, highly literary gatherings of Mrs. Mathew. During these years Flaxman and Blake were struggling for success in the creative arts while supporting themselves by the most tedious journeyman labor, Flaxman by designing pottery for the Wedgwood firm and Blake by engraving for the booksellers after the designs of more successful artists. The great thing both of them wanted was commissions to display their creative talents for profit. Flaxman's genius was thoroughly adapted to the spirit of the times, and his tepid pseudoclassical designs were acclaimed by a steadily widening range of patrons. Blake's genius was more independent and perverse, and wealthy patrons tended to fight shy of him. Most of his life his patrons seem to have been motivated as much by friendship and pity as by their conviction of his transcendant genius, and Blake was a difficult man to be friends with. Many of his earliest commissions came to him, not because his reputation for ability had spread abroad, but because his friends assiduously introduced him to prospective customers. Flaxman probably did more in the way of finding engraving work than any other man in the dark days when Blake took his works to the desolate market and none came to buy. Flaxman was at ease with the chisel, not the pen, and his syntax is often as perplexing as Blake's punctuation. However, he worked quietly and determinedly in Blake's interests for over thirty years, and in the letters that survive we can get occasional glimpses of the success of his efforts. The earliest reference to Blake is on June 18th 1783 when Flaxman reported to his bride Nancy that a young gentleman of their own age, Mr. Hawkins paid me a visit &amp; at my desire has employed Blake to make him a capital drawing for whose advantage in consideration of his great talents he seems desirous to employ his utmost interest[.] 7 And on June 20th Nancy replied: "I rejoice for Blake." 8 The consequences of this were pleasant, and might have been far-reaching. On April 26th [1784] Flaxman wrote to "William Haley" (whose name he could not yet spell), I have left a Pamphlet of Poems with Mr Long which he will transmit to Eartham, they are the writings of a Mr: Blake you have heard me mention, his education will plead sufficient excuse to your liberal mind for the defects of his work &amp; there are few so able to distinguish &amp; set a right value on the beauties as yourself, I have beforementioned that Mr: Romney thinks his historical drawings rank with those of Ml: Angelo; he is at present employed as an engraver, in which his encouragement is not extraordinary— Mr: Hawkins a Cornish Gentleman has shewn his taste &amp; liberality in ordering Blake to make several drawings for him, &amp; is so convinced of his uncommon talents that he is now endeavouring to raise a subscription to send him to finish studies in Rome if this can be done at all it will be determined on before the 10th of May next at which time Mr: Hawkins is going out of England—his generosity is such he would bear the whole charge of Blakes travels—but he is only a younger brother, &amp; can therefore only bear a large portion of the expence[.] 9 Though this subscription never bore its intended fruit, Hawkins did many minor services for Blake, and years later Blake was still writing of "Our good and kind friend Hawkins" and "his former kindness to me". 10 In 1787 Flaxman went to Italy to study classical statuary, a step which he said was "absolutely necessary to [his] improvement". 11 During the seven years he was abroad he probably wrote to Blake now and then, but Blake was never a reliable correspondent. On November 21st 1791 Nancy wrote to Mary Flaxman: "pray call on Mr Blake &amp; beg of him to answer your Brothers Letter directly" [F.P., I, 56]. Evidently even this produced no satisfactory results, for on November 20th 1793 Nancy was still asking Mary Flaxman, "know you anything of Stothard or Blake?" 12 At this time Flaxman was becoming more and more absorbed in the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg. He was probably responsible for Blake's early interest in Swedenborg, and indirectly for Blake's presence at the meeting to organize the New Church in April 1789. 13 This is particularly significant, because it is the only religious group to which Blake is known to have belonged. Flaxman believed firmly in Swedenborg's ideas to the end of his life, though he was not a member of the church; Blake was disillusioned within a year of his joining. Flaxman's mind was pious and conventional, and the differences between the two men are well illustrated by a story Blake's friends were fond of telling. Flaxman : "How do you get on with Fuseli? I can't stand his foul-mouthed swearing. Does he swear at you?" Blake : "He does." Flaxman : "And what do you do?" Blake : "What do I do? Why—I swear again! and he says astonished, ' Vy, Blake, you are svaring !'—but he leaves off himself!" 14 Flaxman probably would not have approved of Blake's bitter couplet: An Answer to the Parson "Why of the sheep do you not learn peace?" "Because I don't want you to shear my fleece." 15 Soon after he returned from Rome in 1794, Flaxman began ascending the heights of popularity, and his commissions were reckoned in thousands of pounds. About this time Blake found himself a modest and reliable patron in Thomas Butts, 16 but during the last six years of the century he is not known to have made illustrations for more than a dozen or so books, and commissions were always welcome. He was particularly in need of work after his enormous undertaking for Edwards' edition of Young's Night Thoughts had failed in 1797 and 1798. 17 During these years Flaxman's old patron William Hayley was composing a poetic Essay on Sculpture , with a great display of classical erudition tending to prove that Phydias and Praxiteles had found a fitting successor in John Flaxman. By the end of 1799 the work was finished, and on December 21st Hayley sought Flaxman's advice, as he usually did, about engravings and engravers: For my first Edition I wish to have only the two following Decorations , if you approve them.—a Frontispiece &amp; a vignette at the close—the 1st from poor Toms outline of Demosthenes at the Base of Neptunes Statue (a scene described expressly for this purpose in the poem) &amp; a neat small Head, as a closing vignette, from your Medallion of the dear disciple, whose character I have sketch'd in the closing Epistle—You I know will have the Goodness to retouch for Him his Demosthenes in such a manner, that it may form an engrav'd outline, &amp; yet still remain very fairly his own design—&amp; you will have the goodness to desire our Friend Howard to make for me such a drawing from your Medallion of the dear disciple, as may furnish us with a proper siz'd ornament for a quarto page to appear under the closing Lines of the Poem—[H.C., IX] Flaxman recommended Blake, and more or less undertook to supervise the progress of the engravings. On January 29th 1800 he reported: I have delivered the Drawing of Demosthenes to Mr: Blake with the right orthography of the Dedication to Neptune, I have also consulted Mr. Howard concerning the portrait of Friend Thomas for the Vignette, he prefers the Medallion to the Picture . . . . 18 There was a particular urgency about this medallion engraving, because Hayley's illegitimate son Thomas, who had been apprenticed informally to Flaxman, was dying. On February 18th Hayley wrote: "I am vexed by a delay of our Friend Howards in regard to his medallion", and asked Samuel Rose to do what he could to hurry the drawing. 19 On February 25th he told Rose that the engraving of Demosthenes had arrived "&amp; the sight of it has been a real Gratification to his [Tom's] affectionate Spirit— . . . —I yet hope the dear departing angel will see his own engraved portrait arrive before his own departure". 20 On March 7th Hayley wrote to Rose suggesting that his friend Davies enlarge his work by a volume on Greek poets, illustrated "by works of Grecian &amp; Etruscan art" for which Tom could make outlines: it is a subject that deserves mature deliberation : with the aid of Flaxman, Howard, &amp; that worthy ingenious Engraver Blake (who has done the outline of dear Toms Demothenes delightfully) we might produce a Book that would do Credit to our Country— 21 On March 14th Hayley wrote again to Rose: My beloved Cripple is sinking gradually in all probability . . . —no news yet of the Medallion —I hope He will yet see it engraved[.] By the 23rd he was getting quite anxious: What can have happen'd to our Friend Howard—Here is the last sheet of the poem, &amp; no Medallion, &amp; no Tidings of it[.] 22 He complained gently to Flaxman about the delay, and on March 26th Flaxman replied: It is equally Surprizing &amp; unaccountable that you have had no farther news of the Engravings, for Mr: Howard finished a beautiful drawing from the Medallion of my Friend Thomas I think four weeks ago, since which time it has been in the hands of Mr: Blake &amp; the copper plate from it is most likely done by this time, as well as that of the head of Pericles but perhaps You are not acquainted with Mr: Blake's direction? it is No: 13 Hercules Buildings near the Asylum, Surry Side of Westminster Bridge[.] 23 Flaxman evidently urged Blake along, 24 and on April 2nd Hayley reported to Samuel Rose: Here is the long-expected medallion arrived today from the Engraver Blake—&amp; I must endeavour to be a Hero . . . &amp; bear a most mortifying disappointment with serenity for mortifying you will allow it to be when I tell you the portrait instead of representing the dear juvenile pleasant Face of yr Friend exhibits a heavy sullen sulky Head which I can never present to the public Eye as the Image of a Being so tenderly &amp; so justly beloved. I believe I must have a fresh outline &amp; a mere outline instead of it— 25 Nothing could be done for some time, because Thomas and Hayley's friend Cowper died within a week of each other in April and May, and Hayley devoted his time to writing midnight epitaphs and planning biographies of his two great friends. After his son's funeral Hayley came to London, and while there, perhaps moved by Blake's eloquent letter of consolation, he seems to have invited the engraver to come to Felpham in July to work on his portrait of Tom. This casual invitation was to change profoundly Blake's subsequent life, perhaps to stifle the lyric impulse in him, but Flaxman (like Blake and Hayley) was for the moment concerned only with very ordinary matters; on July 5th he wrote to Hayley: when Mr. Hawkins left town he desired me to send You a Bas-relief of Paris &amp; Helen framed, which I had no opportunity of doing without making the packing &amp; carriage expensive, untill Mr. Blake's departure who is so kind as to take charge of it together with a Roll (I believe of prints) which Mr: Townley sent for You: 26 On July 16th, after Blake had been at Felpham some time, Hayley replied: My very dear Flaxman as I find our good enthusiastic Friend Blake will (in his Zeal to render the Portraits of our beloved scholar more worthy of Him) extend the time of his Residence in the south a little longer than we at first proposed, I shall not wait to transmit my Thanks to you for a Letter of infinite Kindness by the worthy Engraver on his Return.— . . . The good Blake is taking great pains to render all the Justice in his Power to Romneys exquisite Portrait of Him, &amp; I hope the two next prints will atone for all the defects of the engraved Medallion— It will please you to hear that, as a Tribute to the Genius of our poor disabled Romney, we have preserv'd, &amp; I think improv'd, in a Copy of considerable size, the Miltonic design of our old Friend, that you remember on the Boards of Demogorgons Hall, as we us'd to call his p[ainting] apartment—But I [shall le]ave the good Blake to [carry] on with a History of what He h[as] done in the South on his Return, &amp; only add at present his kind Remembrance to you &amp; yr dear Nancy with the cordial Benediction of yr ever affectionate &amp; afflicted Hermit The Turret July 16 1800 pray assure Nancy with my Love to her, that such a little Book as she desires shall travel to Her by the Favor of Blake—I was highly gratified by the Kind presents from Messieurs Hawkins &amp; Townley which you were so good as to send me under his friendly Care—adieu— 27 Blake's visit evidently changed Hayley's early bad impression, for during that July he gave Blake his son's copy of The Triumphs of Temper with a dedicatory poem, the first draft of which read: From Thomas Hayley to Wm Blake Accept, most[?] visionary Blake, Sublimely fanciful &amp; kindly mild, And favorably[?] guard[?] for friendships sake This favored vision my poetic Child. To give it more Grace than Fancy ever won To thy most tender mind this Book will be, The Book belonged to my departed Son; Thus from an Angel it descends to Thee. 28 Sublimely fanciful and kindly mild! Hayley seems to have been as mistaken about Blake as Blake was about Hayley. In the beginning of August Hayley finally made up his mind to write the biography of Cowper which he had been considering for several months, and he invited Blake to come live in Felpham and work under his patronage, on engravings for the Cowper biography to begin with. With the approval of his friends in London, Blake arranged to move out in September. On August 19th Flaxman wrote to Hayley: You may naturally suppose that I am highly pleased with the exertion of Your usual Benevolence in favour of my friend Blake &amp; as such an occasion offers you will perhaps be more satisfied in having the portraits under your own eye, than at a distance, indeed I hope that Blake's residence at Felpham will be a Mutual Comfort to you &amp; him, &amp; I see no reason why he should not make as good a livelihood there as in London, if he engraves &amp; teaches drawing, by which he may gain considerably as also by making neat drawings of different kinds but if he places any dependence on painting large pictures, for which he is not qualified, either by habit or study, he will be miserably decieved— 29 We may assume that this letter did not come to the attention of Blake, for it seems carefully calculated to rasp on his most delicate nerves, and there was no noteworthy explosion at this time. Flaxman's advice was well-meaning and most bitterly true—eighteenth-century taste would only tolerate Blake as a journeyman engraver—but Blake would not have appreciated having his ambitions blasted in this way. As time went by his friends tended more and more to discourage his bright visions of eternity and stress the bread-winning motif, and Blake became increasingly bitter and prickly. At this time, however, things seemed to be going well for him, and he was profusely grateful to Flaxman and everyone else. On September 12th 1800 he wrote to Flaxman: My dearest Friend, It is to you I owe All my present Happiness. It is to you I owe perhaps the Principal Happiness of my life. Flaxman continued to turn patrons toward Blake, but his own tone became noticeably patronizing, the tone of a competent and successful middle-aged man addressing an impoverished friend from his aspiring youth. On October 7th 1801 Flaxman wrote on the back of his letter to Hayley: Dear Blake I rejoice in Your happiness &amp; contentment under the kind &amp; affectionate auspices of our Friend, Mrs: Flaxman &amp; myself would feel no small gratification in a visit of participation in the domestic Innocence &amp; satisfaction of your rural retreat; but the same Providence that has given retirement to You, has placed me in a great City where my employments continually exact an attention neither to be remitted or delayed, &amp; thus the All besto[wing] Hand deals out happiness to his creatures when they are sensible of His Goodness; the little commissions I troubled you with in my last are such as one friend offers unwillingly to another on account of the Scanty recompence, but I know you relieve yourself from more tedious labours by Composition &amp; Design, when they are done let me have them &amp; I will take care to get the money for you, My Wife unites in love to you &amp; Mrs: Blake. with your affectionate J Flaxman 30 On October 18th Hayley replied to Flaxman's letter: My very dear Flaxman It affords a lively Gratification to your two warm-hearted Friends, the Hermit &amp; the artist of Felpham, to find, that you remember us both so Kindly, in the midst of your grand Occupations.— Be assured, we both take a most friendly Interest in the happy Progress of all your noble Works!—we are both following your excellent Example in point of Industry; &amp; shall rejoice, if we make any near approaches to you in the Merit, &amp; Felicity of our Labours.—With all of these you will in Time be made acquainted, since however deficient they may be, they will not fail to interest, in some Measure, a Friend, whose Feelings are so benevolently warm.—it is with great delight I assure you, that our good Blake grows more &amp; more attach'd to this pleasant marine village, &amp; seems to gain in it a perpetual Increase of improving Talents, &amp; settled Comfort.—. . . [Hayley encloses an epitaph on his wife:] If lovely Features, &amp; a lofty Mind, Tender as Charity, as Bounty Kind, If these were Blessings, that to Life could give a Lot, which makes it Happiness to live; Thou, fair Eliza! had'st been blest on Earth: But Seraphs in Compassion wept thy Birth; For thy deep nervous Woes, of wondrous Weight, Love could not heal, nor Sympathy relate: Yet Pity trusts, with hallow'd Truth serene, Thy God o'er-pays them in a purer Scene. Peace to thy Ashes! to thy Memory, Love! and to thy spirit, in the Realms above, all, that from blameless sufferings below Mortality can hope, or Angels Know! If this should happen to strike you, as it does Blake &amp; me, I shall wish, at your Leisure , to have a most simple small marble monument . . . . adio! carissimo Principe dei Scolptori!—I leave the next page for Blake to fill—with Kind remembrance to Nancy &amp; our united Benediction to you both ever your most sincere &amp; affectionate Hermit 31 And in his letter on the next page Blake identified the latest patron whom Flaxman had sent to him: Mr Thomas, your friend to whom you was so kind as to make honourable mention of me, has been at Felpham &amp; did me the favor to call on me. I have promis'd him to send my designs for Comus when I have done with them, directed to you. 32 For his life of Cowper, Hayley wanted to use a portrait of Cowper by Romney, but he was deterred by Lady Hesketh's intense dislike of the picture, and Lady Hesketh had to be conciliated because she had many of the letters and poems upon which Hayley depended. To confirm himself in his opinion, therefore, Hayley asked Flaxman's advice; on January 18th 1802 he wrote in a postscript: our worthy Friend Blake joins me in every kind wish to you &amp; yr dear Nancy. He allows me to inclose one of his unfinish'd Engravings, that we think you may wish to see for the purpose of forming a Medallion—Be kind enough to keep it in friendly privacy &amp; tell us your frank opinion of it, in its present unfinish'd state : we shall both thank you heartily for any suggestions that may improve it [.] 33 On the 25th Flaxman replied most satisfactorily: In the engraving of Cowper I think my friend Blake has kept the spirit of the likeness most perfectly the eyes are exceedingly well, &amp; in the finishing I presume the extremities of the nose &amp; mouth will be softened which at present appear rather harsh, with kindest wishes &amp; remembrance from Mrs: Flaxman to Yourself &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs: Blake I have the honour to remain [etc.] [F.H.] [.] Upon such authoritative confirmation, Blake and Hayley went ahead confidently with the engraving, and at the end of his January 31st letter to Flaxman Hayley wrote: Here I will only add, that the zealous indefatigable Blake desires to join in every good wish to you &amp; Nancy with your sincere &amp; affectionate Hermit [H.C., IX] In his next letters Hayley's interest had turned to the problem of a monument to Cowper which he wanted Flaxman to make. However, he himself had made a design for the monument, and on February 25th he explained that "our Friend Blake was so Kind as to make me some neat Copies of my design", which he enclosed. 34 On the same day Flaxman replied that "having therefore examined Mr: Blake's drawing for the Monument, repeatedly, I am of opinion, that altho' the emblems are very proper . . .", the design might with propriety be alterred, and he ended his letter "with love to Mr: Mrs: Blake in which Nancy unites to them &amp; yourself". 35 As a consequence of this difference of opinion poor Blake was kept busy copying sketches to get support for Hayley's point of view. On March 24th Hayley again wrote to Flaxman: "I hope Blake's drawing express'd my Idea"; and at the end of his letter he added that "The Kind industrious Blake by my side unites in this Benediction &amp; in every good wish to you &amp; Nancy" [H.C., IX]. During most of the rest of the spring Blake's and Hayley's energies were expended on a series of Ballads about Animals which Hayley wrote and gave to Blake to illustrate and sell, one at a time, for his own profit. 36 Hayley peddled the Ballads indefatigably among his friends, but though everyone liked the Ballads themselves, there were some elementary criticisms of the engravings: that the babies weren't pretty enough, that the ladies lacked feminine grace. Hayley sent a heavy consignment of Ballads for Flaxman to market in London, at the same time asking for encouragement about the quality of the engravings. Flaxman's reply of June 27th was most encouraging; not only had he sold more copies than most of Hayley's Ballad-mongers, but he praised Blake's work as well: Mr: Hawkins has taken two copies, Mr: Long one, Mr: Rogers one, I enclose my subscription for the whole of my copy which I must beg of you to give to my friend Blake, &amp; do me the favor to tell him that I will send the other Subscriptions as soon as I get them—I think the Etchings have Spirit &amp; Sentiment, &amp; calling the attention of man to the virtues &amp; value of the brute creation &amp; making this the vehicle of Service to the worthy artist &amp; printer at the same time, is a part of that tissue of Benevolence which forms the Good Bard's character . . . with Love to Mr &amp; Mrs: Blake in which Mrs: Flaxman unites as well as to the Bard I have the honour to remain [etc.] 37 As 1802 wore on Hayley began to discover that he knew what was good for Blake better than Blake did, and the realization began to obsess Blake that Hayley was an interfering busybody. Relations between the two men became strained, and Hayley's references to Blake in his letters became perfunctory or disappeared completely. Flaxman was unaffected, however, and on August 14th, just before he left for Paris, he sent "love to Mr: Mrs: Blake &amp; Yourself in which Mrs: F unites" [F.H.]. He added a postscript to his letter to Hayley of November 2nd: "Pray give our love to Mr. &amp; Mrs: Blake" [B.M., 37,538, f 4]; and in her letter of December 10th Nancy asked Hayley to "give our Love to the good Cottagers—" 38 On December 16th, Hayley added a P.S. to his letter to Nancy: "poor Mrs Blake has suffer'd most severely from Rheumatism but she is reviving—They return yr good wishes—" [H.C., IX]. On March 21st 1803 Flaxman wrote to say, "I hope you &amp; your Household with Mr: &amp; Mrs: Blake have escaped the Influenza". 39 By January 1803 Blake had had his fill of Hayley. On the 30th of that month he wrote to his brother James: My Wife has had Agues &amp; Rheumatisms almost ever since she has been here, but our time is almost out that we took the Cottage for. . . . we have lately made [a decision] . . . To leave This Place, because I am now certain of what I have long doubted, Viz that H. is jealous as Stothard was &amp; will be no further My friend than he is compell'd by circumstances. It was probably not until some time later that Blake made his feelings clear to his friends and to Hayley, but on April 25th he asked his patron Butts to "Congratulate me on my return to London, with the full approbation of Mr Hayley &amp; with Promise—". Hayley evidently wrote to Flaxman about these complaints, for on May 28th Flaxman replied: "your account of Mr: &amp; Mrs: Blake's having suffered so much from a damp Situation concerns me, I earnestly hope what they propose is for the best, you have allways acted with the same bounty &amp; Kindness by them as you do by all." 40 Gradually the breach between Hayley and Blake widened; Blake began to demand rights Hayley had never heard of, and Hayley did not know how to react. He continued to do his best for Blake, however. On August 7th 1803 he wrote to Flaxman about the drawings Flaxman's sister-in-law, Maria Denman, had made for Hayley's depressing poem entitled Triumphs of Temper : the Engravings were made from the drawings in the State I found them except the omission of one Figure (the tall Minerva ) that Blake &amp; I thought it would be better to omit[?]—I am sorry to say that the Ladies (&amp; it is a Ladys Book) find Fault with the engravings—our poor industrious Blake has received sixty Guineas for them from my Bookseller &amp; I believe both the artist &amp; the paymaster are dissatisfied on the occasion—The Engravings of Cowper have been also heavily censur'd but I think in the Portrait from Lawrence very unjustly for Blake was certainly more faithful than Bartolozzi in the original drawing—I wish our Friend may be more fortunate in the engravings that He is now beginning to decorate a Life of our lost Romney— . . . Blake has made two excellent drawings of Romney one from his own large picture the other from our dear disciples Medallion—I thought of having both engraved for a single quarto volume of his Life—but Blake surprised me a little in saying (after we had settled the price of 30 Guineas for the first the price which He had for the Cowper) that Romneys head would require much Labor &amp; he must have 40 for it—startled as I was I replied I will not stint you in behalf of Romney—you shall have 40—but soon after while we were looking at the smaller &amp; slighter drawing of the Medallion He astonished me by saying I must have 30 for this—I then replied—of this I must consider because you will observe Romneys life can hardly circulate like Cowpers &amp; I shall perhaps print it entirely at my own risk—So the matter rests between us at present—yet I certainly wish to have both the portraits engraved— 41 On August 24th Flaxman replied: a word or two concerning the prints both for the Triumphs of Temper &amp; the projected life of Romney. there certainly was a drawing of Serena veiwing herself in the Glass when dressed for the Masquerade whilst her Maid adjusts her train, &amp; this was by far the prettiest of the set, it was so great a favorite with us that Nancy &amp; myself prevailed on my Sister to make its fellow for our private Collection, you will therefore naturally imagine we were surprized when we greedily examined our Friend's present, to find that our favorite had either been overlooked, or discarded from the Suite of decorations I have not Yet shewn the kind passage in Your letter on this occasion to my Sister, because I feel some uneasiness for all parties concerned but I shall communicate what you have written as soon as I can have a little conversation with her alone—I hope You will excuse my partiality when I say the Sentiment of my Sister's drawings allways appeared to me, just &amp; delicate, altho I must acknowledge there is room for amendment in the effects &amp; drawing of her figures, these corrections might be done in the engraving but I confess the prints for Serena seem in these respects to be worse than the drawings. I am sorry for it because now there is no remedy; since I wrote so far, my Sister has told that the drawing in question was sent to You, but returned for some reason &amp; is the same now in Mrs: Flaxman's folio, but as we are on the Subject of engraving, permit me to offer an opinion concerning the medallion, you may remember how much you was disappointed in the engraving from our Dear Thomas's portrait, &amp; consider whether there is not a possibility that You may be as little pleased with the prints from Romney's Medallion? if this should be the case you will pay an additional sum to make the Your book less acceptable . . . . I am heartily grieved for Blake's irritability, &amp; your consequent trouble[.] 42 This curious letter seems almost designed to influence Hayley against Blake. In particular, the comments on Blake's ability to engrave after Romney may have encouraged Hayley to give most of the plates for this biography to other engravers. It took a treason trial to restore good relations between the two men. Hayley does not seem to have told Flaxman that about two weeks before the date of the last letter Blake had removed an objectionable soldier from his garden, and had been promptly charged with treason and sedition. In the subsequent disagreeable proceedings Hayley stood by Blake nobly, went bail for him, testified as to his loyal character, and paid his lawyer. Thereafter Blake remembered pretty consistently that, however silly Hayley's ideas and poems were, there could be no doubt that he meant well. To show his gratitude, Blake did a great deal of research for Hayley's biography of Romney during the next few years, largely under the direction, or with the advice, of Flaxman. On January 2nd 1804, shortly before Blake's trial, Flaxman wrote to Hayley: Dear and Kind Friend Mr: Blake's opinion that the drawing sent from Norfolk may be advantageously engraved for the ensuing volume of Cowper's life as an agreable perspective of the Situation, seems very just, whilst the Monument itself may be represented on a larger Scale in a Vignette, and for the materials on this subject he will be at no loss—I sincerely wish with You that the Tryal was over, that our poor friend's peace of mind might be restored, altho' I have no doubt from what I have heard of the Soldier's character and the merits of the case that the bill will at least be thrown out by the Court as groundless &amp; vexatious—Blake's irritability as well as the Association &amp; arrangement of his ideas do not seem likely to be Soothed or more advantageously disposed by any power inferior to That by which man is originally endowed with his faculties—I wish all our defects were fewer, certainly my own among the rest—but if we really are desirous this should come to pass, we are told to Whom &amp; by what means we should apply. I wonder my Good Friend as You admired the Genius of Romney so much that You do not remember the whole Catalogue of his Chalk Cartoons . . . . I hope they exist in a perfect State, &amp; if they do, they are well worth etching in a bold manner which I think Blake is likely to do with great success &amp; perhaps at an expence that will not be burthensome—but at any rate give him one to do first for a tryal . . . . I have troubled You by Mr. Blake with a Short tract written for Dr: Rees's Cyclopedia, on Basso Relievo, with one of the prints [by Parker] referred to at the end of the article, the rest are not yet engraven . . . . A happy release from his afflictions to poor Blake, &amp; to you my Dear Friend many happy years unclouded by misfortune or Sorrow[.] 43 Flaxman remained faithful to Blake's interests, and continued to look for work for him, while Blake continued to cause difficulty by his casual approach to business. On January 4th Prince Hoare wrote to Flaxman: Dear Sir, Being disappointed of a proper copy of my pamphlet [of Academic Correspondence , 1803] &amp; proof of Mr Blake's Etching which I hoped to have sent you today, I will not longer delay thanking you for your dissertation on Bas relief, which I have read with very great admiration. 44 Of all the occasions of Blake's tardiness, however, this delay is perhaps most understandable, for it was in the very next week that his trial for treason took place in Chichester. Blake was acquitted amid the cheers of the crowded courtroom, and Hayley had a celebratory banquet afterwards. On his return to London, Blake wrote immediately, on January 14th, to thank Hayley for all his kindness; and he continued: I have seen Flaxman already as I took to him early this morning your present to his Scholar; he &amp; his are all well &amp; in high spirits &amp; welcom'd Me with kind affection &amp; generous exultation in my escape from the arrows of darkness. On May 1st Flaxman expressed his gratitude for all Hayley had done: you will readily beleive how much I was delighted with your friendship equally generous &amp; magnanimous to poor Blake when under the most threatening circumstances, &amp; indeed I rejoiced no less in the event— . . . [In reply to your query you may like to know that] Mr. Blake is to have from 5 to 6 Guineas each from Messrs. Longman &amp; Rees for the plates of the Homer [after Flaxman's designs] according to the labor, but what the proper recompence for more finished engraving might be I cannot tell, but this might be learned from the Booksellers, Mr: Davis is better qualified than almost any one to inform you of the current prices; it might perhaps be advantageous to Romney's life, to adorn the book with two or three bold etchings shadowed, on a small scale, in which Blake has succeeded admirably sometimes &amp; to engrave some of the other compositions in outline only for head &amp; tail pieces to the Chapters or divisions of the work . . . . 45 Evidently Blake and Hayley were still haggling over money. Blake, as we have seen, had been promised the engravings to Hayley's biography of Romney, but Hayley began to think it would be better to have someone else do them, and he suggested to Flaxman that Caroline Watson might be a good choice. Flaxman was obviously distressed at this change, and made it clear to Hayley that he wanted no part of the new arrangement. June 8th 1804 Dear &amp; Kind Friend The drawing you sent arrived safe &amp; I think is very prettily concieved &amp; delicately executed, however before I spoke to Caroline Watson concerning the engraving I was willing to know the probable expence by consulting a friend who is a very great Artist in that way [Stothard?], he told me that the abovementioned lady engraves in the dotted manner only, which is not fit for the decoration of Books, &amp; that the lowest expence of such a plate will be 35 Guineas, you will decide on the price &amp; manner, then let me know your determination— . . . I beg you will countermand your desire that Blake should buy the additional plates to the Homer when published for I shall send them to beg your acceptance sufficiently ashamed that they are no return for the many presents you have sent to me of a kind so much more valuable— 46 Hayley must have replied promptly, for on June 16th Flaxman wrote again: Notwithstanding Your apparent determination &amp; reasons given for having the drawing engraved by the Lady you have mentioned I cannot communicate that commission until I have given my reasons for delay, I, like You, delight in paying a large portion of respect &amp; preference to Female Talent but if I am to execute a commission for a Friend it ought to be done faithfully with a view to his satisfaction &amp; advantage, at least not to his hurt, &amp; really I have seen two children's heads with the abovementioned lady's name lately copied from pictures by Sr. Wm Beechey, but so miserably executed that similar engraving instead of being a decoration, would be a blemish in your Book I am very sure the fault could not be in the pictures, for the Painter is a man of great merit if after this information you still continue in the same resolution as at first I will deliver Your Commission but there my interference must cease &amp; all further communication must be between the Engraver &amp; Yourself, because I foresee that the conclusion of such an engagement must be unsatisfactory to all parties concerned[!] 47 Hayley replied immediately: June 18th 1804 My very Dear Flaxman If I interpreted literally an expression in a Letter of our so lively Friend Blake, who says "London among authors &amp; artists of every kind is a city of assassinations, where every thing is reckoned fair in destroying those we happen to dislike". I should apprehend, that even my Dear magnanimous sculpter had struck with a Barberous stiletto, the Reputation of Caroline The Engraver but as I hold it to be an utter impossibility, that you can act or speak unjustly on so tender a point as that of professional merit, I must suppose that the Eyes or Hand of that ingenious Woman have been injur'd by Time or chance, &amp; no longer possess the Talent for which I gave her full Credit.—at all Events I held it my duty to Romney's Pupil (who generously declines all pecuniary reward for his drawing) to our Dear Painter Himself, to sacrifice my predilection for the female Engraver, &amp; confide the execution of the plate from this very delicate &amp; pathetic Drawing to your kind care &amp; direction.—I will only add therefore it is my wish to have it executed with all possible perfection &amp; I shall think the sum you mentioned 25 Guineas a very reasonable price—I should like to employ your Friend Cromak on the Shipwreck you mention, but as I learn by a letter from Saunders which arriv'd with your last, that Blake has just got in his own appartments the three designs of Romney; given to me by his Son, I should be sorry to risque wounding the Feelings of our quick-spirited Friend by sending the oil sketch from his possession to the House of any other Engraver[.] 48 Obviously both Flaxman and Hayley had learned to treat Blake with some delicacy. On August 2nd Flaxman replied tardily: with respect to Blake's remark upon "Assassinations" I suppose he may have been acquainted with wretches capable of such practices, but I desire it may be understood that I am not one of them, &amp; 'tho I do not deal in "barbarous Stilettos" myself I am willing to acknowledge the benevolence &amp; soundness of Blake's general observation as well as the point &amp; keenness with which it was applied; but this was only a poetic jeu d'esprit which neither did nor intended harm[.] 49 This pious protestation of innocence is particularly interesting in view of Flaxman's sponsorship of Cromek, who later cheated Blake so brazenly. In his letter of November 7th 1804 Flaxman endeavored to soothe Hayley's ruffled feelings while still standing clear of the fray himself. You can have little need to dwell on your friend [Rose]'s illness as an apology for not having been liberal to the artists employed in Romney's life, because in truth your bounty exceeds the expectations &amp; frequently the wishes of all those who do anything for you; as to Mr. Sharpe's leisure to engage in this work, I can say nothing certain about it, for his pursuits &amp; mine for some years past have been so different that we never meet notwithstanding I shall always respect him as a great artist &amp; a benevolent man, I have understood that there is great difficulty in prevailing on him to finish his works, but if you choose to write to him the direction is No. 50 Upper Litchfield Street Oxford Market London, there is another Engraver of distinguished merit who is a punctual honest Man Mr. Parker a fellow Student of Blake, by whom You have a beautiful small print of David playing on the harp before Saul, he lives at, Spring Place Kentish Town, near London, You may besides see specimens of the best Engravers of the present time in Bowyer's History of England &amp; other popular works now or lately published, which will enable you to select the Man[?] that pleases you most with more satisfaction than can arise from any interference of mine as I have no intimacy among them &amp; have no knowledge whatever of their several prices &amp; conditions of undertaking work[.] 50 That Flaxman regarded Blake highly in this period is shown in the repetition of such encomia as that "Blake was the greatest man in the country, and that there would come a time when his works would be invaluable." 51 He continued to solicit work for Blake, and on August 12th 1805 he wrote to Hayley: concerning the Edward the first, I have seen two or three noble Sketches by Blake which might be drawn in outline by him in a manner highly creditable to your book &amp; I would overlook them so far as to see that they should be Suitable to the other designs— . . . the day after I received your last letter, Blake brought a present of two Copies of the Songs [Ballads, surely], it is a beautiful work, Nancy and I are equally thankful for this present and equally delighted with your bounty to the Poet-Artist[.] 52 And one Sunday in September Nancy wrote to her husband that a "Mr T" had been near death, but is now slowly recovering wishes much to see us at Epsom expresses a great &amp; sincere regard for us both &amp; wishes as a great favor the loan of Blake's [illustrations to] Gray to amuse himself with promising that it shall not go from his chamber or be wantonly shewn to anybody he wishes to make a few copies from it—to keep with his Youngs Nights Thoughts &amp; some other works he has of Blakes he wishes to collect all B— has done, &amp; I have a little commission to give to Blake for him—respecting the Loan, I shall take [care] to consider of it[.] 53 With the aid of all this friendly assistance Blake should have been flourishing. Flaxman wrote to Hayley on October 18th that Mr. Cromak has employed Blake to make a set of 40 drawings from Blair's poem of the Grave 20 of which he proposes have engraved by the Designer and to publish them with the hope of rendering Service to the Artist, several members of the Royal Academy have been highly pleased with the specimens and mean to encourage the work, I have seen several compositions, the most Striking are, the Gambols of Ghosts according with their affections previous to the final Judgment—A widow embracing the turf which covers her husband's grave—Wicked Strong man dying—the good old man's Soul recieved by Angels— 54 It is interesting to note that this information (particularly the pious purpose) seems to come from Cromek, and that Blake is clearly to be the engraver. Four weeks later, on November 14th, Flaxman told Hayley: you will be glad to hear that Blake has his hands full of work for a considerable time to come and if he will only condescend to give that attention to his worldly concerns which every one does that prefers living to Starving, he is now in a way to do well[.] 55 On December 1st Flaxman reported to Hayley that Blake is going on gallantly with his drawings from the Grave, which are patronized by a formidable list of R.A's. and other distinguished persons—I mentioned before that he has [all deleted ] good employment besides, but still I very much fear his abstracted habits are so much at variance with the usual modes of human life, that he will not derive all the advantage to be wished from the present favourable appearances— [F.P., I, 92] Perhaps Flaxman mentioned to Blake the disadvantages of his abstracted habits and his eccentricity. Whatever the cause, a noticeable cooling in Flaxman's references to Blake took place about this time. In his letter to Hayley of two weeks later, on December 17th, Flaxman made an extraordinary request: When You have occasion to write to Mr. Blake pray inquire if he has sufficient time to spare from his present undertaking to engrave, my drawings of Hero &amp; Leander, &amp; the orphan family, if he has not I shall look out for another engraver, I would rather this question should be proposed by you than me because I would not have either his good nature or convenience strained to work after my designs[.] 56 It must have been a considerable breach that prevented Flaxman from just walking round to see Blake, instead of using such a devious method. This quarrel seems to have followed the pattern of most of Blake's breaches with his friends. It probably began with the friend advising Blake that his temporal and financial interests would be served if he would conform a bit more, as in Flaxman's letter to Hayley above. This, of course, Blake deeply resented, and vented his anger in violent words and bitter epigrams. Usually he decided that his critics were both stupid and jealous. Of Flaxman he wrote: I mock thee not, tho' I by thee am Mocked. Thou call'st me Madman, but I call thee Blockhead. 57 and You call me Mad: 'tis Folly to do so— To seek to turn a Madman to a Foe. If you think as you speak, you are an Ass, If you do not, you are but what you was. 57 On Nancy he wrote: How can I help thy Husband's copying Me? Should that make difference 'twixt me &amp; Thee? 57 And on Flaxman and Stothard: I found them blind: I taught them how to see; And now they know neither themselves nor me[.] 57 Though Blake's denunciations are a trifle shrill, it is likely that Fuseli was not the only one who found Blake "damned good to steal from". Partly because of this breach, Hayley and Flaxman turned to other engravers when they knew of work for which Blake might have been qualified. However, they liked to help him when they could. On March 11th 1808 Flaxman wrote to Hayley: yesterday Mr. Raimbach left proofs from the plates for my opinion . . . . concerning the price I cannot pretend to judge, this must depend on the value Mr. R. sets on his time or the agreement he made, I can tell You as I did him that Mr. Longman paid 5 Guineas each one with another to Messrs. Blake, Parker &amp;c for the plates they engraved for the Homer and with which those Artists were highly contented—[F.L., no. 33] And on May 4th he reported further concerning the engraving Mr. Raimbach thought very modestly that Mr. Blake would execute the outlines better than himself but it was not possible to take the commission from the person that brought it to town, besides at present I have no intercourse with Mr Blake— 58 It is likely that part of Blake's bitterness was due to the fact that Flaxman seems to have taken the part of Stothard and Cromek in the acrid dispute over the Chaucer painting. Flaxman did not stop working in Blake's interests, however. On August 19th 1814 he replied to John Bischoff's enquiry about having an engraving made from one of Flaxman's monuments for Dr. T.H. Whitaker's history of Leeds (published as Loides and Elmete in 1816): If the Revd Doctor should be satisfied with an outline of the Monument, such as those published of Homer's Iliad &amp; Odyssey, as well as some in Cowper's translations of Milton's Latin poems, which is now a favorite style of decoration in books, I can make the outline myself &amp; will request the Editor's acceptance of it—the engraving including the Copper plate will cost 6 Guineas if done by Mr. Blake the best engraver of outlines— 59 Blake did not get this commission. The last reference from these letters exhibits the relationship of Blake and Flaxman in perhaps its most characteristic light. In July 1816 Nancy wrote to her husband: I have had some discourse with our Friend [Tulk?] about Blakes book &amp; the little drawings —It is true he did not give him anything for he thought It would be wrong so to do after what pass'd between them for as I understand B— was very violent Indeed beyond all credence only that he has served you his best friend the same trick [some] time back as you must well remember—but he bought a drawing of him, I have nothing to say in this affair It is too tickilish, only I know what has happened both to yourself &amp; me, &amp; other people are not oblig'd to put up with B s odd humours —but let that pass[.] 60 Nothing further is known of this quarrel, but it was obviously just one of many that littered the history of Blake's friendships. Evidently, however, the Flaxmans continued to put up with Blake's odd humors, for in an uncolored copy of the Songs of Innocence is the inscription "Mrs Flaxman April 1817". 61 This is the last evidence of personal contact between Blake and the Flaxmans, but we may assume that the relationship continued in its old uneven channel until Flaxman's death, eight months before Blake's, in 1826. Blake was a passionate intense little man, and, as this correspondence shows, it was not easy to be friends with him. In a moment of anger and bitterness Blake once wrote: O God, protect me from my friends, that they have not power over me. Thou hast giv'n me power to protect myself from my bitterest enemies. 62 It is likely that during the forty-six years he knew Blake Flaxman would have felt the justice of this with great vividness. Blake also wrote: Great things are done when Men &amp; Mountains meet; This is not done by Jostling in the Street. 63 Blake's friends probably lamented that it was so often necessary to persuade Blake to come down from his far mountains to jostle in the street.</field>

Symons, William Blake (1907), p. 358. 4 Poetry and Prose of William Blake , ed. G. Keynes (1948), p. 660. 5 Cf. "A. S. Mathew, Patron of Flaxman and Blake", N&amp;Q , CCIII (1958), 168-178. In reference to A. Cunningham's statement ( The Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects [1830], III, 277) that the Rev. Mathew "aided Flaxman in befriending Blake", Maria Denman, Flaxman's sister-in-law, wrote: "Mr. Flaxman befriended Blake, as well as many others, but without being assisted by any one, besides recommending him to many of his friends." It seems equally clear that Cunningham was referring directly to the Poetical Sketches , and that Miss Denman was not. Unfortunately Miss Denman did not comment on Cunningham's even clearer statement (Symons, p. 393), that Flaxman "not only counselled their [the Sketches ] publication, but joined with a gentleman of the name of Matthews in the expense, and presented the printed sheets to the artist to dispose of for his own advantage." (Miss Denman's statement was made in one of a series of notes on Cunningham's Lives , which she sent to the author, and which his son, Peter, published in The Builder , XXI [1863], 37-38, 60, as "New Materials for the Life of John Flaxman, R.A." An examination of a microfilm of these notes, which are now in the National Library of Scotland, reveals that Peter Cunningham was a very faithful transcriber, making only the most minor spelling and punctuation rectifications, and omitting only two exceedingly minor items.) J.T. Smith (Symons, p. 358) is probably the source of A. Cunningham's information. 6 A.C. Swinburne, William Blake (1925), p. 8. 7 Quoted from volume I (f 29) of the Flaxman Papers in the British Museum (39,780); hereafter these letters will be cited as F.P., with volume and page . There is no year on this letter, but someone (quite possibly John Flaxman) added the date in pencil, as he has to many letters, particularly those of Nancy. John and Nancy were married at the time of this letter; their marriage took place on June 3rd 1782, and since they were surely not separated within two weeks of marriage, the earliest (and most likely) date for this letter is 1783, which agrees with the pencil date. In this article, all superior letters, as in Mr. and 10th, have been lowered, but otherwise minutiae are reproduced as accurately as type will permit. Other abbreviations used in this article are: M.L.: Morgan Library (New York) MS quoted from a microfilm. H.C.: Hayley Correspondence in the Fitzwilliam Museum , Cambridge, England. These references are given with the volume number, but the manuscripts are not carefully enough organized to warrant page citations. F.L.: Flaxman Letters, a group of fifty-six letters in a green book in the Fitzwilliam Museum , cited by number. F.H.: Flaxman-Hayley letters, a group of letters loose in a folder in the Fitzwilliam Museum . B.M.: British Museum , followed by the MS reference number. I am grateful to Professor Arthur Friedman, and to my mother and wife, for indispensable help in verifying quotations from the MSS. 8 F.P., I, 157; this letter is dated in pencil June 20th 1783. It clearly answers the foregoing letter, because in it Nancy refers to their recent marriage, and says she is "charm'd with your noble account of Miss Younge" which John had sent two days before in the other letter. 9 M.L. This letter is dated simply April 26th, but it begins: "Sir I return many thanks for the present of your last publication &amp; I have the pleasure to inform you (exclusive of the satisfaction I felt in perusing such genuine &amp; new productions of genius) I have conversed with many persons of considerable abilities, who with one consent praise the Noble purity &amp; Pathos of the Tragedies, &amp; the novelty, Wit, &amp; originality of the Comedies—" The work referred to is clearly Hayley's Plays of Three Acts (1784), which was so recent as to make any favorable criticism desirable. This letter is also quoted in The Letters of William Blake , ed. A.G.B. Russell (1906), pp. 51-52 and T. Wright, The Life of William Blake (1929), I, 12. (I shall cite published sources only when they seem to have direct reference to the MS.) The "Copies of Eleven Letters to Mr Hawkins from John Flaxman Kindly lent by John Heywood Hawkins—To Maria Denman April 18, 1843" (F.P., XI), dated 1820 to 1824 (except for one of November 14th 1803), have no reference to Blake. 10 Letter to Hayley of October 23rd 1804. D.V. Erdman ( Blake Prophet Against Empire [1954], p. 99 ff) argues that about this time (1784) Blake put Flaxman into his satiric Island in the Moon as "Steelyard the Lawgiver". His most telling piece of evidence is that Steelyard is concerned in very minor parish business, and Flaxman "eked out his small income by serving as a parish rate collector." However, Flaxman's sister-in-law, Maria Denman, wrote firmly (P. Cunningham, p. 60): "Mr. Flaxman never was a collector of water-rates,—at least, I never heard it; but I do know that he scrupulously avoided all parish business throughout his life." 11 S. Smiles, Josiah Wedgewood, F.R.S. (1895), p. 245. 12 F.P., I, 61. There is no date on the MS, but another hand (John's?) has written in November 20th 1793; this date seems possible, for the death of John's mother (who died early in 1793) may be inferred from the letter. 13 D.V. Erdman ("Blake's Early Swedenborgianism: A Twentieth Century Legend", Comparative Literature , V [1953], 247-257) effectively demolished the evidence that Blake's parents were Swedenborgians. However, in demonstrating that Flaxman could not (because he was in Italy) have been Blake's direct contact with the 1789 meeting, Erdman overstated his case. Flaxman had been among the earliest of those interested in Swedenborg; on February 10th 1784, after a visit to Hayley at Eartham, Flaxman wrote to his host: "Pray when you have a favorable opportunity let me have Swedenborg, which reminds me of the Hedg-hogg who is very well &amp; we have a tender regard for him on the givers account" (F. P., I, 33; cf. M. Bishop, Blake's Hayley [1951], p. 78). On January 26th [1790?] Flaxman enclosed a note to Mr. Sanders with his letter to his parents (F.P., I, 48) in which he said: "I am fully sensible of the present changes in Europe being necessary to the present Season of the Church, at the same time that they testify the truth of E:S:'s mission[.]" This radical enthusiasm is particularly interesting when coupled with the fact that in this letter Flaxman sent love to William Sharp, about whom he wrote to his father a few years later, on July 22nd 1794 (F.P., I, 63): "The newspapers have informed us that our friend Mr: Sharp the Engraver has been examined on suspicion [of treason], but from what I know of him I think his character so excellent that I cannot believe anything will be found against him." Sharp and Flaxman were among the early members of "The Theosophical Society, instituted for the Purpose of promoting the Heavenly Doctrines of the New Jerusalem by translating, printing, and publishing the Theological Writings of the Honourable Emmanuel Swedenborg" (R. Hindmarsh, Rise and Progress of the New Jerusalem Church in England, and America, and other Parts , ed. E. Madeley [1861], p. 23). It seems quite possible, as Erdman suggests, that Sharp was Blake's direct contact with the New Church group, though he himself was not there—or at least did not sign their unanimous resolutions ( Minutes of the First Seven Sessions of the General Conference of the New Church , reprinted from the original editions, 1885). 14 A.M.W. Stirling, The Richmond Papers (1926), p. 8; cf. A.H. Palmer, The Life and Letters of Samuel Palmer (1892), p. 24. 15 Poetry and Prose , p. 100. 16 Cf. "Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas", PMLA , LXXI (1956), 1055. 17 It seems likely that Flaxman bought the edition of Young's Night Thoughts for which Blake made engravings in 1796 and 1797. In Flaxman's account books ("Study account for 1796", F.P., V [H], 13 and 29), under date of July [24th?] 1796, is "Blake 5 5 -", and between May 6th and 13th 1797 is "Blakes book, binding", three shillings. The Night Thoughts were advertized to appear "Early in JUNE" 1797 (G. Keynes, Blake Studies [1949], p. 61), priced at five guineas (to subscribers) for the entire work. Normally, of course, the work was sold bound, but Flaxman may have taken an early copy (the latest date on the engravings, presumably postdated, is June 1, 1797) with some of the illustrations still in proof state. In these same accounts (I, 6) is a record of payment of two guineas to Blake in October 1797; the price for the first section of the Night Thoughts (the others were never issued) was two guineas. This last payment could have been for coloring the engravings, as was done in several copies; or, alternatively, one or more of these entries could refer to Blake's illustrations to Gray (cf. fn 53). In the Haverford College Library is a receipt, signed by Blake and dated Dec 14th 1799, for £9.0.8 from Flaxman for engraving the plates for Flaxman's Letter to the Committee for Raising the Naval Pillar . 18 F.L., no. 18; cf. E.J. Ellis, The Real Blake (1907), p. 187; M. Wilson, The Life of William Blake (1948), p. 131 and The Letters of William Blake (1956), p. 40 fn. According to J.T. Smith (Symons, pp. 364-365), "For his marginal illustrations of 'Young's Night Thoughts,' . . . [Blake] received so despicably low a price, that Flaxman . . . determined to serve him whenever an opportunity offered itself; and with his usual voice of sympathy, introduced him to his friend Hayley". 19 H.C., III; all the letters to Rose cited below are from this volume . On this same day Blake sent Hayley a proof of Demosthenes which "has been approved by Mr Flaxman". 20 In this letter he also thanks Rose for expediting the Demosthenes engraving, and explained that the delay with the medallion drawing was due to the inflammation of Howard's eyes. Hayley's language about his dying son was often stilted; but his emotion was clearly profound—in this letter he told Rose, "at times . . . I can only weep". 21 Hayley's better spirits were based on his hopes from Tom's imminent operation. Two days later, on March 12th, in his letter to Rose, Hayley predicted of Tom: "He will yet prove an Artist of astonishing powers—"; he also said that "Davies approved our Suggestion for his intended Book—". It is possible that this was Edward Davies, the Welsh antiquary and British Israelite. 22 Part of this and the next letter to Rose are quoted in Wright, I, 96. 23 F.L., no. 19; cf. Ellis, p. 187, Wilson, p 131, The Letters of William Blake (1956), p. 40 fn, and W. Hayley, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq , ed. J. Johnson (1823), II, 495 (omitting the reference to Blake). 24 Blake to Hayley, April 1st 1800: "With all possible Expedition I send you a proof of my attempt to Express your &amp; our Much Beloved's Countenance. Mr. Flaxman has seen it &amp; approved of my now sending it to you for your remarks." 25 Cf. Wilson, p. 131. 26 Quoted from a microfilm of the MS in the Library of The Historical Society of Pennsylvania. In a postscript Nancy asked "for a Pocket volume from the dear Boy's Library—as a Keep Sake—for Remembrancer I need none". 27 H.C. IX; the breaks in the text are caused by a hole made when the seal was removed. Cf. Wright, I, 98, and Wilson, pp. 132-133. This letter is important evidence that Blake's later stay at Felpham had not been planned before this time, and that the arrangement was more or less impromptu, based on mutual friendship. 28 Quoted from a photostat of the MS in the Allan R. Brown William Blake Collection in the library of Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. This draft was written in great haste; the reading of many words, particularly those later deleted, is in doubt, and I have supplied all punctuation. In line 1 of this draft, "most" was changed to "my gentle"; above the first three words of line 3 is written, "Accept and fondly call keep"; in line 5, "To give it" has been altered to "Rich in"; in line 7 "The Book" was changed to "For it"; and in the last line "So" was substituted for "Thus". The final version of the poem, with the date, was given by J.T. Smith (cf. Symons, p. 367). 29 F.L., no. 21; cf. Ellis, pp. 187-188, Wilson, pp. 133-134; Wright, I, 100, and M.R. Lowery, Windows of the Morning (1940), p. 48. The first "not" is inserted over a caret. This letter suggests that Blake's engraving work was not the primary purpose of his move to Felpham, at least as expressed to Flaxman. This letter is in curious contrast to that of April 26th 1784. 30 Quoted from another group of Flaxman-Hayley letters, in an orange folder, in the Fitzwilliam Museum; the letters between brackets were lost when the page was torn. After the signature of his letter, Flaxman added: "I shall beg your permission to address the other Side to Mr: Blake". Cf. Wright, II, 184 (with the letter to Hayley); A.N.L. Munby, "Letters of British Artists of the XVIIIth and XIXth Centuries — Part I", The Connoisseur , CXVIII (1946), 26-28 (with a facsimile); and The Letters of William Blake , ed. G. Keynes, who says (p. 218) that it was also printed in the catalogues of Sotheby (November 8th 1927) and Maggs (no. 544, June 1930). Blake was evidently aware of Flaxman's attitude as expressed in this and the August 19th 1800 letter, for on November 22nd 1802 he asked, why "Must Flaxman look upon me as wild"? 31 H.C., IX; part of the letter is quoted in Wilson, p. 139; and the poem appears as no. 47 in "A Collection of brief devotional Poems composed on the Pillow before the Dawn of Day 1801" in the Cornell University Library. The Blake letter on the next page has been torn off, and is now in Colorado Springs. In a postscript to Blake's letter, Hayley wrote: "Weller says it would soothe &amp; comfort the good sister of the upright Mr. D. to see a little sketch from yr Hand." Keynes ( The Letters of William Blake , p. 67 fn) surmises that this may be a "Mr Dally"; but in his letter to Hayley of October 7th 1801 Flaxman suggests a design for his monument to "Mr Dear". 32 "Mr Thomas" was almost certainly the "Rev. Joseph Thomas, Rector of Epsom" who subscribed to the edition of Blair's Grave with Blake's designs published in 1808; cf. p. 184. According to A. Gilchrist ( Life of William Blake , ed. R. Todd [1942], p. 104), "Flaxman recommended more than one friend to take copies [of the Songs of Innocence and Experience ], a Mr Thomas among them, who, wishing to give the artist a present, made the price ten guineas [instead of about a guinea]. For such a sum Blake could hardly do enough, finishing the plates like miniatures." Thomas also owned an extra-illustrated edition of Shakespeare for which Blake made six illustrations (now in the British Museum), but there is no record that he possessed anything else by Blake. The artist completed two sets of Comus watercolors, but it is not known which, if either, belonged to Thomas. 33 H.C., IX; cf. Wilson, p. 367. In this letter Hayley says further: "if my affection for his [Cowper's] Memory does not deceive me, his Letters are the most admirable &amp; delightful Letters that were ever imparted to the World.—" This may be compared with Blake's letter of September 11th 1801, in which he says Hayley's biography "will contain Letters of Cowper to his friends, Perhaps, or rather Certainly, the very best letters that ever were published." 34 H.C., IX. Hayley had also sent a copy to Lady Hesketh, and another to Flaxman, which he feared had gone astray; both of them were presumably sketched by Blake. 35 Quoted from a microfilm of the MS in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library; cf. the catalogue no. 24 (March 1929) of Elkin Mathews Ltd, 33 Conduit Street, London W.1. 36 Cf. "William Blake as a Private Publisher", Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 61 (1957), 539-560. 37 F.H. The written year is 1801, but the postmark is clearly June 28, 1802. Flaxman's praise was badly needed about this time; on July 15th Hayley replied to Lady Hesketh's criticisms ("Blake, Hayley, and Lady Hesketh", R.E.S. , N.S., VII [1956], 277-278): "I allow [your critical friend] . . . to be as severe as He pleases, as we happily counteract his Censure with the applause of a more competent , but also a nameless Judge , who has said, I think with more Truth , that there is great spirit &amp; sentiment in the engravings of my Friend.—" On January 30th 1803 Blake sent "5 Copies of N4 of the Ballads for Mrs Flaxman." 38 Quoted from the MS in the Chicago Art Institute; there is no year in the written date, but the letter refers to "our late Excursion to France", which took place during the brief peace, in September 1802. 39 B.M., 37,538, f 6. The beginning of this sentence is "—I am sorry for Mr: Spilsbury's illness I hope he is better". On June 28th 1802 Charlotte Collins in Midhurst had written to Hayley about her success in selling the Ballads, and reported that one of her customers "by the name of Spilsbury " wanted Blake to engrave some animals he had drawn (cf. "William Blake as a Private Publisher", p. 544). Hayley evidently later came to know this Spilsbury; at least "E.G." refers to him familiarly in a rhymed epistle to Hayley on November 6th 1802, describing a visit to Midhurst: Here our well-belov'd artist (and oh may queen Fame Trumpet forth in our streets Mr Spilsbury's name) Receiv'd me and welcom'd me home: where I sat And devour'd a short meal and enjoy'd a short chat[.] The letter concludes with a Postscript You'll let the Meyers and Mr Blake My kind remembrances partake[.] (Quoted from a microfilm of the MS in Harvard University Library.) This Spilsbury does not seem to be the professional artist whom Blake (and presumably Hayley) knew—cf. Blake's letter of September 28th 1804. 40 Quoted from a microfilm of the MS in the Yale University Library. 41 Quoted from the MS in the possession of Sir Geoffrey Keynes. 42 M.L. Blake made an engraving from a medallion after Romney for Hayley's biography of Cowper, but the present medallion seems to be connected with the biography of Romney. 43 M.L.; cf. The Letters of William Blake (1906), pp. 133-137. Blake seems to have gone to Felpham several days before his trial with this letter. Parker's engraving is dated Jan 2, 1804, two others by Bond are dated Dec 1, 1807, and the fourth plate illustrating Flaxman's article is by Blake, dated Nov 11, 1818. Rees's Cyclopedia was finally published in 1820. 44 F.P., II, 41. On February 23rd Blake sent "the Academical Correspondence of Mr Hoare" to Hayley. 45 B.M., 36,540, f 50. Blake made a number of engravings after designs by Flaxman, notably for Flaxman's Letter to the Committee for Raising the Naval Pillar , 1799, his Illiad of Homer , 1805, and Compositions from the Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod , 1817. Gilchrist (p. 96) asserted that the original engravings to Homer were lost en route to England, and that Blake provided substitutes (with the name of the original engraver, Piroli), but he gave no evidence; Wilson (p. 77) therefore doubted the whole episode, and Todd (Gilchrist, p. 375) reaffirmed Gilchrist's account, but still without producing evidence. It may therefore be useful to record Hayley's statement (B.M., 30,803 B, f 110, n.d., probably early 1803) that Flaxman's Odyssy is rare: "I believe there are hardly 3 copies of it in England for the main body of these delightful Engravings was seized by the French — I am not sure that Flaxman himself has a copy". The existing copies were those that Flaxman had sent individually to friends from Italy. On the other hand, Flaxman's account books (F.P., V [F]) record payments to Piroli but none to Blake. The Bodleian has the plates to Flaxman's Homer. It has been noticed that Blake made a much more conscientious attempt to reproduce the living lines of Flaxman's drawings than the other engravers who copied the sculptor's sketches. 46 Quoted from the MS in the Library of Congress. Hayley wrote ( The Life of George Romney, Esq. [1809], p. 195): "The praise, which my friend [Romney] bestowed on that interesting print, engraved by Caroline Watson, induced me to engage this very delicate artist in decorating the present volume." 47 F.L., no. 22; cf. Ellis, p. 251, and Wilson, p. 372. Flaxman concludes his letter by recommending "Cromak" who had made the best engravings ever done after Stothard, for the engravings of the Romney biography. "Mr. Cromak is a man of independent Spirit &amp; is very handsomely employed as he well deserves—". 48 Quoted from the MS in the possession of Sir Geoffrey Keynes. Hayley concludes by asking Flaxman to pick out pictures by Romney "for your favourite Engraver" Cromek to engrave for the biography. The Blake letter quoted (very imprecisely) at the beginning of this letter is dated May 28th 1804. The Flaxman letters of this time are full of references to Cromek (see especially Mary Ann Flaxman's letters of 1804 and 1805, F.P., IV). 49 F.L., no. 23; cf. Ellis, p. 260, Wilson, p. 190, and Wright, I, 165. In this letter Flaxman reiterates that Cromek "is abundantly employed &amp; sought after". 50 M.L. On October 1st (M.L.) Flaxman told Hayley that Cromek was too busy to undertake the Romney engravings. 51 Tatham, quoted in The Letters of William Blake (1906), p. 40; cf. also J.T. Smith (Symons, pp. 373, 388); S. Palmer (in Gilchrist, p. 303—and pp. 1, 101); Literary Gazette (August 18th 1827, p. 540). 52 F.L., no. 26; cf. Ellis, p. 267; Lowery, pp. 47-49; Wilson, p. 194; and Wright, II, 11. In 1805 Hayley's Ballads, with Blake's engravings, had been published by more conventional methods by Phillips, and Hayley had again resigned his share in the profits to Blake. 53 F.P., I, 263; the "[care]" was covered by the seal. "Mr T" is almost certainly the "Rev. Joseph Thomas, Rector of Epsom"; cf. fn 32. M.L. Lowery ("Blake and the Flaxmans", The Age of Johnson [1949], p. 285) seems to suggest that the Blake illustrations were made at the time of the Flaxmans' marriage; however, the edition of Gray inset into the pages is dated 1790, and the Flaxmans were married in 1782. Blake wrote a poem "To Mrs Anna Flaxman" to accompany the illustrations. The most likely and commonly accepted date for the illustrations is 1800, when Blake was particularly grateful to Flaxman for his introduction to Hayley. I have found no further reference to these illustrations to Gray (but cf. fn 17). Fuseli exhibited "The Bard", "The Descent of Odin" and "The Fatal Sisters" (all of which Blake treated) at the Royal Academy in 1800. Nancy evidently collected poetry; on April 10th 1813 (B.M., 30,805, f 44) she wrote: "My Poetic Chest goes on charmingly . . . Especially a Poem accompanied by half a Dozen charming drawings—"; and in her collection was Blake's "dedication to the Grave" "To the Queen" (F.P., IX, 89). It is curious that the only one of Blake's works in "Illuminated Printing" which the Flaxmans are known to have owned was the Songs of Innocence and Experience (G. Keynes and E. Wolf 2nd, William Blake's Illuminated Books [1953], p. 261). 54 M.L.; cf. The Letters of William Blake (1906), pp. 185-186, and Wright, II, 12. Only the last two drawings were engraved. 55 M.L.; cf. The Letters of William Blake (1906), pp. 186-187. Flaxman's resolution not to interfere seems to have been wavering, for in this letter he says "I called on Miss Watson" and they discussed the problems involved in engraving after Romney. 56 F.P., I, 94-95; cf. Bishop, p. 306. In his letter of October 18th 1805 Flaxman had written, "we have read your Hero and Leander and are much pleased with the beauty and elegance of the Translation". I know nothing further of this work. 57 Poetry and Prose , pp. 654, 655, 656. 58 F.L., no. 34; cf. Wright, II, 28; Wilson, pp. 207, 375; and M.R. Lowery, Windows of the Morning (1940), p. 50. 59 Quoted from a microfilm of the MS in the Library of The Historical Society of Pennsylvania; cf. J. Sandell, Memoranda of Art and Artists (1871), p. 31. Flaxman bought one, and perhaps two, copies of Blake's engravings to Job ; there is evidence that Blake received three guineas for "one copy plain" about October 1823 (E. Wolf 2nd, "The Blake-Linnell Accounts in the Library of Yale University", The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XXXVII [1943], 2), and that Flaxman paid for "Blake's Job £3.3" in September 1825 (F.P., XII, 142). According to Tatham, "Mr Flaxman introduced Blake to Mr Wedgwood" and procured him engraving work not long before this time (Keynes, Blake Studies , p. 70, citing a note on a proof plate of the Wedgwood catalogue now in the possession of Mrs. Robert D. Chellis, 9 Pembroke Rd, Weston 93, Mass). 60 F.P., I, 364; there are numerous references to the Tulks in Flaxman's letters about this time which are preserved in the Fitzwilliam (along with a portrait apiece by Flaxman of Mrs. Tulk and her two children, dated 1816) and in F.P., especially vol. II. The Tulks owned copies of Blake's Poetical Sketches, Songs of Innocence and Experience and "No Natural Religion" (Keynes and Wolf, pp. 6, 59). 61 Keynes and Wolf, p. 61. 62 Poetry and Prose , p. 384. This is cited by Scott as a Spanish proverb in The Letters of Sir Walter Scott 1819-1821 [vol. VI], ed. H.J.C. Grierson (1934), 418, and in Redgauntlet , chapter XXI. 63 Poetry and Prose , p. 661.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Recurrent Printing by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For many eighteenth-century books the printer supplied only enough copies to meet immediate needs and then, whenever he could hold the type, reimpressed as often as a continuing sale might require. Work in moderate demand might proceed through several printings, each issued at a certain interval and readily identified by differences in paper, text, typography, or press figures. Work achieving sudden notoriety, on the other hand, might run through numerous impressions, all issued, perhaps, only a day or so apart and bearing very few marks of identification. Occasionally, indeed, as with Erskine's View of the Present War with France (1797), the interval is so close as to be non-existent and the variation so slight as to be detected only in the changing 'edition' label on the title. The View , published 8 A.M. Saturday, 11 February, went through nine 'editions' by the end of the following week, fifteen by the end of the month, twenty-five by the end of March, and thirty-five shortly thereafter. Whether this tract actually comprised so many 'editions' was then and is now a matter of some concern. In his Letter to Erskine John Gifford remarks that he was unable to peruse a copy "until it had been deemed expedient to imprint ' The Ninth Edition ' in the title-page," and somewhat later plaintively inquires: Sir, permit me to ask you, whether the artifices which have been employed to provoke a forced circulation of your work, are such as are consistent with the dignity of your public character? As if determined to prove the justice of my suspicion, that you wrote for the populace , and not for the people , a cheap edition has been announced, men have been hired to hawk it about at the coffee-houses, and in the streets, and not a retailer of seditious publications in the populous suburbs of the metropolis but proclaims the amplitude of his stock by a bill at his door, calculated, by its enormous size, to catch the eye of the passenger.—In short, the very same manoeuvres have been exerted to extend the sale of your production as were used to circulate the treasonable tracts of your client—that infamous incendiary Thomas Paine . To this Gifford appends a revealing note: The public will be less surprized at the number of editions through which your work has so rapidly passed, when they are informed, that each edition consisted only of a fourth part of the number which it is usual to print; so that the fourteen editions of Mr. Burke's pamphlet 1 would be equal to fifty-six of your own. The public taste, therefore, in this instance, is not so depraved as it appears to be.—The press, too, has been kept standing, in order that any number of editions might be printed, without any additional expence to the publisher. 2 Printing from standing type, the procedure Gifford regards as exceptional, was, of course, by this time a common device, evident not only in the 35 'editions' of Erskine, but in the 14 of Burke and, as a matter of fact, in the 11 of Gifford's own Letter . Whatever the number printed, the total count is thus, for each of these, equally suspect. Among these sixty only six may be correctly described as editions; all others are of lesser significance and uncertain denomination, ranging, so far as one may judge by appearances, from a completely differentiated impression to a single alteration at press—the 'edition' label. When it comes to defining these and other doubtful specimens even the most scrupulous bibliographer is soon reduced to an expedient no less reprehensible than the one Gifford deplores. Since in these instances he is usually unable either to distinguish separate from continuous printing or to determine the relationship among points confined to one or extending to several 'editions', the bibliographer must designate all such curiosities by the most inclusive and least exact term at his disposal. 'Issue,' always implying a certain interval of time, cannot apply to these uncertainties. 'State,' often implying an alteration at press, is likewise inapplicable, contrary to the explicit declaration on the title and inappropriate for variations which, though unseen, may yet be as real as those existing in stereotype. 'Impression,' however, being much less restrictive, offers the bibliographer a way around the difficulties already mentioned, allows the printer every right to his claim ('impression' being, for him, equivalent to 'edition'), and imposes upon the reader the task of proving otherwise. In this context all that the bibliographer implies is recurrent printing, a somewhat indefinable condition affecting an indeterminate number of pages and extending over an immeasurable period of time. Unfortunately, if the bibliographer assumes even this much, some inquisitive reader may discover a point apparently limiting the condition to the title and thus degrade the supposed impression to a variant state. Such evidence probably will be found, not in the defects earlier printers endeavored to remedy—in mispagination, omitted signatures, false catchwords, errata lists, and the like—all of which are now generally left unattended, but rather in slight alterations of the text. If these occur either as cancels persisting through several 'editions' or as readings mixed in various sheets obviously the gatherings so affected derive from stock available upon original issue. But again, the evidence, though disallowing 'impression' as proper reference for the entire work, is itself so qualified that 'state' may not everywhere apply. A hybrid of this sort appears in specimen C5. Amid all these uncertainties I now present various examples of what, for want of a better word, may be described as recurrent impressions. As these progress, often within the same book, through several gradations subject to more precise definition, they are listed most conveniently by author and the variant identified by one of the six letters cited below. After each letter I indicate the significance of the term as employed in these circumstances. (a) Edition . All or an appreciable portion reset. Since resetting may extend from 1 to 99 per cent of the type, 'edition' here refers to any book reset in two or more consecutive gatherings, an apparent indication that earlier distribution was intentional and later composition an undertaking not previously contemplated. (b) Issue . A much-abused word, but useful in this analysis for anything less than an edition but more than an impression. 2a (c) Impression . A reprint, with or without revisions, issued possibly with other printings, but separately prepared and distinguished by a full array of press figures or other series of points. (d) Recurrent impression . Certainly in part and perhaps in whole a separate printing; without the usual sequence of points, but exhibiting at least one other than title. (e) Recurrent impression ( assumed ). Differing it would seem only in title, but presumed to vary consistently in other respects. A provisional designation for variants which, in the absence of other evidence, cannot be classified as d or f . (f) State . Variant occurring within an impression. When these criteria are applied to the twenty books listed below and the results posted in the accompanying Table it is apparent that, even upon the most liberal construction of the term 'edition', the 158 so described by the printer actually comprise only 28, and that of the 130 remaining no less than 82 fall into limbo e , beyond definition. Yet these imponderables are not to be disregarded, even in a bibliography limited to 'the first edition', for by definition of that term all are essential to it.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes on Variants In the following survey the number of copies examined, while adequate for illustration, is quite inadequate for bibliographical purposes. Very likely if, as intended, this review prompts further inquiry, other impressions (or whatever one chooses to call them) will be found intervening between those now identified and, among those described, some few may be designated by a term other than the one here assigned.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Gifford seems to have confused Burke's Two Letters on the Proposals for Peace (12 editions), an occasion for the Erskine tract, with the Letter on His Pension (14 editions), a piece irrelevant to the View . Both, however, are proper subjects for this review of suspect impressions. 2 First quotation presumably entered in 1st edition, p. 2, second and note in 2d edition, pp. 179-180. The earliest edition I have seen is the third, one which, in comparison with others, allows the charge that follows but not, as yet, a full substantiation. 2a On reissue , a term consistently used in a recent bibliography of Hannah Cowley, see my commentary in the 1958 Winter number of the Book Collector . 3 Since of each book the first impression (c) must also be regarded as the initial printing of an edition, and each succeeding edition (a) as the first of one or more impressions, both variants of this order are given a double entry to balance accounts. 4 Six later 'editions' assigned to e category. 5 Eight 12mo.

      <field name="heading_text">THE COMPOSITION OF The Insatiate Countess , Q2 by Robert K. Turner, Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recently George Walton Williams showed, by means of type-shortage evidence, that certain Elizabethan dramatic quartos were set by formes rather than seriatim as was commonly supposed and that this method of composition could be employed by two compositors working simultaneously as well as by a compositor working alone. 1 To the plays cited by Mr. Williams I shall add another, the second edition of Marston's The Insatiate Countess , largely a two-compositor book which seems to have been set by formes within the stints of the respective workmen. The Insatiate Countess Q2 (which collates A-I 4 ) was printed in the shop of Nicholas Okes in 1616. It was "apparently set up, more economically, from the 1613 edition and used a slightly wider type page — an advantage in the prose passages — and one line of print more to a page . . . . There is no lavish spacing; superfluous [lines] are avoided . . . and the stage directions are contracted and inset." 2 In many respects Q2 is a typical reprint; many of the textual inconsistencies and errors which abound in Q1 were transferred without change to the later edition. Among the typographical features adopted by Q2 from Q1 was the use of italics, indented, for speech prefixes; and, as I shall point out later, certain of these italics are the source of information about the order of composition. Spelling evidence shows clearly that in sheets A through H two compositors were at work, setting the following type pages: Compositor X: A1-A2 v B3-C2 v D3 v -E2 v Compositor Y: A3-B2 v C3-D3 E3-H4 v This pattern is a variation of that found in Okes' The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke (1609) and The Duchess of Malfi (1623). 3 Sheet I, however, was evidently set by formes. I1 v , I2, and I4 contain enough of Compositor Y's preferred spellings to make assignment to him almost certain, and on I2 the use of an italic capital in the signature links this page with D2 and F1 where Y, unlike X, used italic capitals for the same purpose. I cannot be sure of his presence on I3 v , but, since he set the rest of the forme, I think it likely that he set that type page also. 4 Sigs. I1, I2 v , and I3, on the other hand, contain a total of seven examples of a distinctive change of the copy spelling to Ile , a form which is characteristic of neither X nor Y. I believe, therefore, that these three type pages, and probably I4 v (which contains few significant spellings in its nineteen lines), were composed by a third workman, Compositor Z. The nature of the collaboration between Compositors X and Y enforces the inference that they were setting simultaneously: generally one composed one-half of the type pages in a sheet while the other composed the other half of the same sheet. The interesting point is that within their respective shares of a particular sheet they seem to have set by formes rather than seriatim. Although the evidence is not conclusive, the pattern of type shortages suggests that this method was chosen by both compositors; indeed, there would be no point in one compositor's setting by formes unless his collaborator adopted the same procedure. The only letter that seems consistently to have run low during the composition of the book was the italic capital A, which was needed frequently to set the speech prefixes and the names of the characters Anna, Arsena, and Abigal, and both workmen made this deficiency good by substituting the roman capital A. That this substitution was more-or-less systematic is indicated by the clean breaks on certain pages between the appearance of the italic letter and the substituted roman letter, 5 and, as Mr. Williams has shown, where the depletion of one letter is remedied by the systematic substitution of a letter from a different font, the resultant pattern can be very useful as evidence of the order of the setting of the type pages. In The Insatiate Countess Q2 the clearest pattern can be seen in sheet C, where the probable order of setting seems to be as shown in the following chart, in which the numbers to the left of the slash represent A 's and the numbers to the right are roman A's substituted for italic: B C 4 v 1 v 2 1 2 v Compositor X 2/0 2/8 0/7 0/2 0/1 2 v 3 v 4 3 4 v Compositor Y 1/0 5/1 1/4 0/5 0/5 Here what happened seems to be clear enough. Both compositors had enough italic letter to finish setting sheet B (I shall show later that B2 v and B4 v were probably the last type pages of the sheet to be composed). But both ran short in sheet C, began to substitute the roman letter (X on C1 v and Y on C3 v and C4), and finished out the sheet with roman letter exclusively. The implications of this arrangement are clear also; while X was setting two pages of the inner forme of C, Y was setting the other two pages, and thus the inner forme was completed and imposed before work was started on the outer forme. At this point we can look to the running-title evidence to establish the order of composition of the remaining formes, working on the assumption that the first formes through the press were also the first composed. The book was machined with two skeleton formes: skeleton I imposed A(o), B(o), C(o), D(o), E(o), G(o), H(o), and I(i), and skeleton II imposed A(i), B(i), C(i), D(i), E(i), F(o), F(i), G(i), H(i), and I(o). As we know from type-shortage evidence that C(i) was composed before C(o), it follows that the order of composition of the formes of the first five sheets was probably A(i), A(o), B(i), B(o), C(i), C(o), D(i), D(o), E(i), and E(o). The type-shortage pattern in these formes is as follows, where once again the left-hand numbers represent italic types and the right-hand roman for italic: 6 A B 1 v 2 1 2 v 3 v 4 3 4 v Compositor X - 1/0 - 1/1 6/0 3/0 2/0 2/0 4 3 v 4 v 3 2 1 v 1 2 v Compositor Y 5/0 0/1 3/1 0/1 1/1 0/2 5/0 1/0 D E 3 v 4 4 v 1 v 2 1 2 v Compositor X 1/0 - - 1/0 3/0 - - 1 v 2 1 2 v 3 3 v 4 3 4 v Compositor Y - - 5/0 - - 3/3 0/5 - 2/3 It is impossible to be sure that these pages were composed in just the order indicated in the chart, and the patterns are not clear enough to permit much more than a guess at the procedure that was adopted. Nevertheless, I suspect that some such circumstances as the following attended the composition of the early formes. The fact that A 's were in short supply suggests that some type was standing when the setting of The Insatiate Countess Q2 was begun; hence, it is not surprising to find that both compositors were forced to substitute roman for italic in order to finish out sheet A. Some of this standing type seems to have been distributed by Compositor Y after the setting of A3 v , since he secured from some source three A 's for use on A4 v . Compositor X also seems to have obtained enough of this letter to last through the setting of his part of sheet B and the first few lines of C1 v . That certain type pages were set out of order ( e.g. , A4 before A3 v ) seems quite possible since the book was set up from printed copy which could have been cast off with great accuracy. A(i) and A(o) probably came from the press and were distributed during the setting of sheet B (possibly the six italic pieces obtained by Compositor Y for use on B1 and B2 v came from A[i]), but the evidence is by no means as clear as one could wish it. It is fairly sure, however, that no distribution was made during the composition of sheet C, and I suspect that D3 was set by Y rather than X because the latter had stopped composing in order to distribute the type which had been used to set B(o) and B(i). C(i), distributed by Y after the composition of C4 v and before the composition of D1, may have been the source of the eight italic types consumed in the setting of D1 and the first part of E3 v , but it is impossible even to speculate about the time of distribution of C(o) since that forme contained no pieces of the italic letter. The spelling evidence indicates that after he had set his part of sheet E Compositor X was called off the job, and the running-title evidence suggests that his removal caused Compositor Y to fall behind the press. The use of skeleton II to impose both formes of sheet F probably means that at the time of the completion of the last forme of that sheet to be set both I and II were off the press and available for use. In order to effect the minimum press delay, the formes of sheet E and F would have had to go through the press in the following order: Skeleton: II I II II Forme: E(i) - E(o) - F(i) - F(o) If E(o) had preceded E(i) through the press, the compositor doubtless would have used skeleton I rather than skeleton II to impose one of the formes of sheet F. Since he did not, I think it likely that this order is correct and that Compositor Y continued to set by formes after Compositor X left the job. Had Y set sheet F seriatim, three type-pages of F(o) would have been on the stone at the time F(i) was imposed. It seems improbable, then, that he could not have set F4 v , thus making F(o) ready for the press, before F(i) was machined and skeleton II released. In sheet G, however, the typographical evidence indicates that the compositor began to set seriatim. The following pattern is found: G 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v Compositor Y 1/2 1/0 7/0 1/2 - - 2/0 5/1 On both G1 and G2 v the substituted roman types appear after the italic types, but on G4 v the one roman type is preceded by one italic and followed by four, probably an accidental rather than a deliberate substitution. I judge that distribution took place between the setting of G1 and G1 v and between G2 v and G4, although in neither case is it possible to be certain of the forme that was distributed. The workman's reason for changing his method of composition is not apparent. It is true that he was no longer setting in collaboration with Compositor X, but, since he was unable to keep pace with the press during the composition of sheet F, it is strange that he would have chosen to set sheet G in such a way that he had to compose three additional type-pages before a forme was ready for the press Nevertheless, he seems to have done so, and we can infer that another press delay occurred between the machining of F(o) and G(i). There is no type shortage in sheet H. In sheets G, H, and I there is some rearrangement of the running-titles within their skeleton formes, for which haste may have been responsible. It is interesting to note that skeleton II retains in I(o) the same form it had in G(i), which leads one to think that I(o) was machined before H(i). Apparently Compositor Z started work on I(o) while Compositor Y was still engaged in the setting of sheet H, and, one judges, he probably came on the job to prevent another press delay. Thus it appears that the order through the press of the last few formes was as follows: Selection: II IIa Ia IIa Ib IIb Ic Forme: F(o) - G(i) - G(o) - I(o) - H(o) - H(i) - I(i) From this analysis it is possible to draw two conclusions. First, with regard to the play itself, it may be inferred that the edition was smaller than usual since two compositors were needed to match the pace of the press and since a delay appears to have occurred when one of them withdrew from the job. Secondly, this analysis tends to support Mr. Williams' thesis that setting by formes in quarto printing was a more common practice than it has been thought to be, and it further indicates the value of type-shortage evidence in bibliographical investigation. Moreover, by comparing Q2 with Q1 it should be possible to make some estimate of the accuracy of three of Okes' compositors when they were setting from good copy. The Insatiate Countess Q2 should be a particularly valuable control on the work of the man I have called Compositor Y, since it is possible to see him operating under different conditions of composition — at a fairly moderate pace in the first part of the book and in considerable haste in some sections of the last part.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">'Oh! Sophonisba! Sophonisba! Oh!' by D. F. Foxon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James Thomson's Sophonisba received its first performance at Drury Lane on February 28th, 1730; it had a great success, running for ten nights, out of which Thomson received three benefits. Millar paid 130 guineas for the publishing rights. The printing was the work of W. Bowyer, and from the evidence of his paper ledger (which is discussed in more detail below) 1 the first paper for the play arrived on the 27th, but printing apparently cannot have commenced before March 4th. On Monday March 9th the Daily Post announced: On Wednesday next will be publish'd, Sophonisba. A tragedy. As it is now acting at the Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane. By Mr. Thomson. Printed for A. Millar . . . N.B. A small number is printed in 4to on large paper, for the curious. [Later advertisements add:] Price in 4to. 2s. 6d. in 8vo. 1s. 6d. On Wednesday March 11th the date of publication had been postponed —the Daily Post reads 'To-morrow morning will be publish'd' and on the Thursday announces 'This day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, will be publish'd'. The Daily Journal gives the time as 'This afternoon at five'. The statutory nine copies were deposited at Stationer's Hall on March 11th, and those that survive contain no cancel; it therefore seems possible that the day's delay was caused by the need for cancellation discussed below. Copies of both the quartos and octavos collate A-L 4 , with A2 a cancel in the first impressions; the octavos are printed by half-sheet imposition. It is clear that the quartos are a separate and earlier impression; Mr. Iolo Williams pointed out 2 that they have a list of five errata on L4 as opposed to three in the octavos, and this will serve for the moment. The type pages had to be reimposed for half sheet imposition and to adjust the margin before the octavos could be printed; the independence of the two impressions is also attested by the completely different press figures. Though I have seen no uncut copies of the quartos it is clear from Bowyer's ledger that the ordinary quartos were printed on Crown paper which usually has small initials GF as watermark; the fine paper copies are on Writing Demy with a fleur-de-lys watermark. There was no need to make adjustments to the type between printing the two, and one cannot assign priority between them; any attempt runs against contradictory evidence: 1. On G1 v , p. 42, a headband with a winged cherub as its centre appears in all Demy copies, but only some Crowns; in others it is replaced by a block with a rudimentary fleur-de-lys, which is also used in the octavos. The cherub block re-appears at the head of A3 in all copies, showing four nail heads; it apparently came loose from its mounting while the Crown paper was being printed and had to be replaced. This confirms that the octavos were printed after the quartos; shows that the preliminaries were as usual printed last; and that in this forme the Demys were printed first. 2. At the head of L2 v there is a row of type ornaments. In all the Crown copies I know of, this is composed of 11 blocks; in the Demy copies one block has apparently dropped out; and in the octavos it has been replaced by its mirror-twin which does not properly complete the design. This evidence suggests that in this forme the Crowns were printed first. This discrepancy of evidence need not disturb us. The use of the same press-figures throughout 3 shows that the printing of quartos was continuous irrespective of paper. It is perhaps rash speculation, but observing that one piece of evidence is in the inner and one in the outer forme, we could argue that the contradiction is explained by a logical printing sequence such as one in which the outer formes of Crowns were printed first, followed by the Demys; then the Demys preceded the Crowns in perfection with the inner forme. 4 For my part, neat as this explanation is, I would just as soon put the discrepancy down to the varying practice of pressmen. Before discussing the different impressions in octavo it is as well to deal with the cancellation of A2 in the quartos and the first octavo impression. A2 carries Thomson's dedication to the Queen, and a comparison of the text as found uncancelled in a few quartos with that in the cancels reveals a number of textual changes. The original dedication 5 read: [A2 r ] MADAM, / THE notice, Your MAJESTY has condescended to take of the following Tragedy , emboldens me to lay it, in the humblest manner, at Your MAJESTY's Feet. And to whom can this illustrious Carthaginian so properly fly for protection, as to the QUEEN of a People , more powerful at sea than Carthage ? more flourishing in commerce than those first Merchants ? more invincible to conquest? [A2 v ] and, under a Monarchy , more free than a Common-wealth itself? But I dare not here attempt a Character, where both the great and the amiable Qualities shine forth in full perfection. All words are faint to speak what is universally felt, and acknowledged by a happy people. Permit me therefore only to subscribe myself, with the truest zeal, and veneration, May it please Your MAJESTY, / Your Majesty's / Most devoted Subject, / and Servant , / JAMES THOMSON. The revised setting 6 has the following variants: as to a QUEEN, who commands the hearts of a People , . . . more secure against conquest? and, under a[A2 v ] Monarchy , . . . I dare not, nor indeed need I, here attempt . . . MADAM, / Your MAJESTY's / Most humble, / Most dutiful, / And most devoted / Servant , / JAMES THOMSON. As Dr. Todd points out to me, these changes are not only stylistic; the first change also gives a less ambiguous expression to Thomson's republican views. In spite of the fact that Thomson is a classic example of a man with second thoughts, 7 it is unlikely that the cancel would have been made had it not been for an ill-advised attempt to make these changes by stop-press correction while the octavos were printing. In printing by half-sheets the recto and verso of the half-sheet are locked up side by side in one chase and printed together; when the sheets have been perfected from the same type the sheet is divided and two perfect half-sheets are the product. It appears that when the preliminaries of the octavo had been printed on one side, Thomson wished to revise the text of the dedication. If the type is changed at this stage the inevitable result is that the revised recto and verso will perfect the unrevised verso and recto, and if one leaf is revised the half-sheets will each contain one revised and one unrevised page. This would be unsatisfactory but not disastrous; what caused chaos in the case of Sophonisba was that the corrections involved moving the three words 'and, under a' back from verso to recto; the final result was that half the copies had these three words repeated on the turn of the page, and the other half omitted them completely. One example of each case survives uncancelled, 8 and each in a copy which contains sheets of the second impression; these copies may have been put together after the main batch of the first impression had been sent for cancellation. There is no evidence that the corrections were made precisely at the end of the first run through the press; if corrections were made before the first run was complete, some copies would be printed with the full corrected text; if the corrections were made after perfection had begun, some copies would have the full unrevised text. 9 I have not located any copies of the first impression where both recto and verso are in the same state, but they may survive unnoticed. However that may be, it is clear that the dedication [state a] had to be cancelled when recto and verso did not fit. In addition to the corrected text [state b1] already standing in type, the dedication was set up three more times [b2-4] so that four cancels could be printed at once (presumably still by half-sheet imposition). Thus there are four different settings of the cancel, of which one preserved the heading, factotum, and first seven lines of text of the original; and this setting [b1] was reimposed with the other preliminaries for use in later impressions. It was not absolutely necessary to print cancels for the quartos which had already been correctly printed, though with the unrevised text; but presumably with the type at hand either Thomson or Bowyer decided to carry the improvements through by printing the cancels in quarto as well; all four settings are found in Crown copies, and they were probably also used for the Demys, though in these only two of the settings have so far been noticed. It should perhaps be noted here that from the evidence of Bowyer's paper ledger all the copies which required cancellation (both quarto and octavo) were handed over to an unidentified Harris on March 9th and a small new impression of 750 copies was delivered direct to Millar (the publisher) on the 12th, the day of publication. If Harris was responsible for the task of cancellation (and perhaps for stabbing the pamphlets), it is possible that the copies delivered direct to Millar were those first issued, though of a later printing. With the octavos we come to more difficult ground; the general outline is clear, the details obscure. With the help of twenty copies lent by Messrs. Pickering and Chatto (and one in the British Museum) which could be collated side by side, it was not difficult to sort out variants; it soon became clear that some copies were mixtures of sheets from different printings. But out of twenty-one copies, sixteen fell into four groups of mutually consistent copies; each of the remaining five was a unique mixture. It seemed clear therefore that even though there were occasional sheets apparently common to two groups, each group had some sort of independent existence; and this view was encouraged by Nichols' mention of four 'editions' 10 (confirmed in general by Bowyer's paper ledger). I here refer to the four groups as four impressions. The reliability of my sample is statistically doubtful — for example it included four examples of one cancel and three of another, but none of the other two, though all four should be equally common. Details of the groups and mixtures appear in Table 2 below; Table 3 attempts to show the distinctions in each signature of each group. Examples of each of the four impressions have been collated on the Hinman collating machine. In many sheets this reveals throughout a slight movement of the type such as would be compatible with tied up type-pages being reimposed with different furniture and often with new running titles; this is represented in Table 3 by a vertical rule between impressions of a sheet. In a number of cases the type is apparently undisturbed except for some small detail — a printer's flower damaged, a press-figure inserted or a slight change in spacing; these are indicated by a broken vertical rule and probably represent formes which have been kept locked up in their chases between impressions. In a few other cases there is no noticeable difference between states, and while there is no reason why locked up formes should not have been reimpressed as they stood, it is possible that overprinting of the sheet at an earlier time made reimpression unnecessary. The behaviour of press-figures is far from helpful. Thus in sheet H the figure 7 on p. 56 appears in only some copies of the first and third impressions (and very likely in some copies of the second not seen by me); this is caused by frisket-bite, the figure being below the direction line — some copies show the figure half obscured. But in sheet E the same figure 1 appears clearly in all the first three states; there is a good deal of movement of the type between impressions 1 and 2 which makes reimpression certain despite the remaining press-figure; there is no movement between impressions 2 and 3, but in the circumstances the presence of the same press-figure is not a reliable indication of continuous impression. The same is true of impressions 3 and 4 of sheet K which are linked by a common press-figure. There was considerable interchange of headpieces as the printing went on, though not sufficient to give a clear picture of the order in which sheets went to press. In the first impression ornaments used in B and C were used again in G H I and L, which suggests normal progressive printing. The same ornaments are found in the second printing of the sheets G to L but that from K was later used to fill the gap left in B during the first printing. The gaps in C were filled by printers' flowers and the headpiece from E — which was itself replaced from I. Thus in the second impression some at least of the later sheets were printed before the earlier; and of the earlier C was printed before E. The only rearrangement in the later impressions 11 was that the gaps left in I and K by the changes in the second printing were both filled by the same set of printers' flowers which were apparently used in I and then K in the third impression, while in the fourth they remained in K and were then moved back to I. The only detailed evidence for the history of Sophonisba's publication is found in Bowyer's paper ledger now in the Bodleian, though this raises almost as many problems as it solves: As mentioned above, the first 30 reams of Demy paper for the octavos were delivered before the first night, February 28th; the Writing Demy for the fine quartos on the other hand did not arrive until March 4th. Since the quartos were printed first, the printing must have started after this and have been completed by March 9th when the first copies were delivered to Harris and advertisements inserted in the press. The first problem arises in considering the simplest entry, the Writing Demy quartos. 1 ream of paper (500 sheets) is not sufficient to produce the 50 copies delivered, for Sophonisba runs to eleven sheets in quarto. A hypothesis which fits certain other facts is that the original paper order was made on the basis that the book would only run to ten sheets; in that case one ream would have sufficed. But how the figures have been made to balance in the ledger must be pure guesswork. The Crown quartos are much more of a problem. It appears from the ledger that 34½ reams were delivered; this should have produced 1570 copies rather than the 689 actual or 700 nominal in the ledger. If we could read the March 2nd entry as 6 half-reams the figures would be more reasonable. The half-reams would presumably be left-over oddments; the preliminaries are found with at least two watermarks, both different from those in the body of the book, which offers some confirmation. We could then assume that the original order for 28 reams was based on the estimate of ten sheets, and the six half-reams the additional paper for the additional sheet. We then have the more simple relationship of a supply of paper for 1400 copies and only 700 copies accounted for. Whether only half this number were printed or whether 700 copies were put on one side is still an unsolved problem. However, Thomson's Works in octavo, 1738, vol. 1. contained the 1730 sheets of Sophonisba with the title removed, a half-title being printed on T4 of the newly printed body of the volume. 1000 copies were printed as against 1500 of vol. 2, 12 and both octavos and Crown quartos (brutally cut down on all four edges and oversewn) were used to make up the volume. This suggests either that sales of the quarto were very bad (in which case a decision to halve the printing order would have shown foresight) or else that the missing 700 copies were held back with a reissue in a quarto volume of Works in mind. Sophonisba did indeed appear in vol. 2 of the quarto Works published in 1736, but this was a quarto of too large a size for the sheets to have been of use. The thirty reams of Demy were probably first intended to produce 3000 copies; when it became clear that eleven half-sheets would be needed, an additional three reams were ordered. These did not arrive until March 9th, the date when the first copies were delivered, and the original printing appears to have been 2250 copies. This would have taken 25 reams, leaving five to add to the three delivered on March 9th. These eight would then suffice to produce the second impression (here 'second edition') of 750 copies delivered to Millar — the three days, March 9th - 12th, would have been a reasonable time to print these. The chief problem is the deliveries to Massey and Mrs. Dodd, totalling a thousand copies. These must correspond to the 11 reams received on March 11th, but the deliveries are not dated. It is not impossible that this thousand copies, the third impression, was completed between Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon. If it were so, it is not surprising that sheets of the three impressions printed in a week sometimes got intermingled. The final order of paper arrived after publication day and the thousand copies resulting apparently lingered until November — indeed there was little demand for them thereafter, since they could still be reissued with a cancel title as 'The Second Edition' in 1735 (announced in the Grub Street Journal of April 3rd 1735 at 4d.) and again in vol. 1 of Thomson's Works , 1738. It is no doubt their poor sale which accounts for the fact (noted by the D.N.B. ) that it was not until after 1738 that Thomson revised the offending line, 'Oh! Sophonisba! Sophonisba! oh!'</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Supplementary Notes on Samuel Richardson as a Printer by Alan D. McKillop</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The list of books printed by Richardson given in Professor Sale's Samuel Richardson : Master Printer (Ithaca, 1950) is so comprehensive that random and incidental additions would be of little use. The following title, however, deserves special consideration: The / Matchless Rogue: / Or, An / Account / of the / Contrivances, Cheats, Stratagems and Amours / of / Tom Merryman, / commonly called / Newgate Tom: / Who Stiled Himself, / Baron of Bridewell, Viscount of New-Prison, / Earl of Holborn-Hill, Marquiss of Newgate, / And Duke of Tyburn. / With / A particular Detail of his Life and Actions, both / Comical and Tragical, from the Time of his / Birth in Newgate, to the Hour of his Unhap-/py Exit at Tyburn. / [Rule] / [Motto] / [Rule] / London: / Printed for A. Moore, near St. Paul's. MDCCXXV. / [Price 1 s. 6 d. ] The presence of Sale's ornaments 20, 29, and 65, with identifying defects, shows that this fictionalized criminal biography is from Richardson's press. The name of the pamphletshop proprietor A. Moore appears in the imprint of a few other early pieces of Richardson's printing. I have examined copies of The Matchless Rogue in the Newberry Library and the British Museum, but it is not listed by Arundell Esdaile. Before Pamela , Richardson seems to have printed very few works that can be classified as prose fiction. Sale's findings give us, besides Ramsay's Travels of Cyrus and an abridgement of Gulliver , only Defoe's New Family Instructor , and, in part, the New Voyage Round the World and Religious Courtship . The eighty-seven pages of The Matchless Rogue carry Tom through a series of varied and disconnected adventures to his final condemnation. The Preface emphasizes the intention to convey a moral with every incident, whether related in "a Serious, Ludicrous, Tragical, or Comical Manner." For example, "The unhappy tale of the Mercer's Daughter, ought to caution all young Women from giving Credit to the Promises; nay, even to the Oaths of deluding Men" (p. v). A passage on the importance of paying heed to dreams as warnings sent by Providence (pp. 52-53) may be imitative of Defoe. Nine years later Richardson in his Apprentice's Vade Mecum expressed his disapproval of Newgate characters on the stage. 1 Despite the professed didactic intention of The Matchless Rogue , there is nothing here that he could not have got elsewhere and little of which he could have approved, but the existence of this ignoble little story helps us to realize that his work as a printer gave him an enforced familiarity with the popular fiction of the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Existing correspondence between the Rev. James Hervey and Richardson and other references in their letters give fairly full information about Richardson's printing of Hervey's Meditations among the Tombs, Reflections on a Flower-Garden , and later the collected Meditations and Contemplations . The evidence is gathered by Sale, pp. 174-175, and the present note includes only additional details gathered from a few other letters. The earliest surviving reference to the project seems to be in a letter of May 25, 1745, dated from Thomas Hervey's, Basinghall Street, from James Hervey to an unnamed correspondent, possibly a printer associated with Richardson: Your last two favours I received together. I thank you for the specimen of types. I hope better paper is intended to be used, than that whereon the types were printed; which I think coarse and slovenly. I am most inclined to send abroad the pieces in a matrimonial state: I mean, not in separate pamphlets, but united in a volume. They seem to be a contrast to each other, and may, perhaps, mutually recommend one another. Probably the 'Meditations among the Tombs' may carry too doleful an aspect; and, if not enlivened a little with the brighter scenes of 'The Garden,' may terrify the reader, and create disgust. I shall take an opportunity of talking with Mr. Richardson on this affair; and shall, if he take the trouble of perusing it, put one of the letters into his hands: though it must be the mourning piece, because I have no copy of the gayer essay, but what is in shorthand. What you hint at, with regard to the largeness of the character, that old and enfeebled eyes may be able to read it, is perfectly right. I shall desire that this suggestion may be observed. 2 On June 28, 1746, Hervey wrote to the Rev. Mr. Thompson of St. Ginnys: "My little piece, entitled 'Meditations among the Tombs' and 'Reflections on a Flower Garden,' has been published a considerable time. . . . Mr. Richardson, the author of 'Pamela,' is my printer. Seven hundred and fifty copies are struck off; the printer and writer are joint adventurers with regard to pecuniary advantages, if any such should accrue from the sale." 3 Though the Meditations and the Reflections have separate titlepages, collation, and pagination, they were simultaneously published as a single piece; the Dedication and the Preface, printed as pp. i-viii of the Meditations , are designed for and refer to both parts. Richardson also brought out the second edition, and took so long about it that Hervey had time to add contemplations on night and on the "Starry Heavens." On August 22, 1747, he wrote to Dr. Stonhouse asking to borrow a copy of Andrew Baxter's Matho for use in completing the latter piece: "If your Matho is not lent out of Town, I wish you woud be so good as to send for it, &amp; favour me with a Sight of it by the Bearer. The Reason of my requesting this, is, that M r . Richardson informs me by my Brother, if He has not this last Piece by the middle of next Week, his Press must stand still. And, methinks, I w d gladly peruse Matho, before I suffer my last Essay to depart." 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Dr. Thomas Birch, a close acquaintance of Richardson during the whole of his literary career, gives us from time to time in his letters some interesting details of the printer's business: The Business of Printing has of late met with great Interruption from a Rebellion of the Compositors against their Masters upon a Demand of a Shilling a Sheet to be added to their Pay: which the latter have refus'd, &amp; are resolv'd to stand still for the present, &amp; starve the Seceders into Submission, who have no Pretence for Complaint, a Compositor of common Skill &amp; Industry being able to earn 30 s. a Week: &amp; I am told, that Bettenham, when he was a Journeyman, us'd constantly to get near 50 s. Richardson has kept the Masters firm to their Interests, &amp; drawn his Pen (which, you know, is a very ready &amp; copious one) upon the Subject, &amp; wrote a Circular Letter to his Brethren. 5 Birch gives us the fullest account we have of the fire of 1752 in Richardson's printing house: The Element of Fire has this Year shown a peculiar Enmity to the Interests of Learning; of which the irreparable Calamity at your Brother's Chambers is one Instance, &amp; Mr. Richardson' [ sic ] the printer's whole House &amp; Magazines narrowly escap'd being another on Thursday sennight. I knew nothing of the Accident when I last wrote to you, my first Intelligence of it being from the Bishop of Oxford in a Visit on Sunday Afternoon. It was occasion'd by the Negligence of a Boy, who in a back Room full of paper printed or unprinted, on the Ground floor, was folding of Sheets, which caught fire from his Candle about seven at night, fortunately before the Men had left their Work, &amp; while Mr. Richardson himself was at home; who felt the Heat in the Floor of the room where he was, so intense, that it was scarce tolerable, for the Boy had not given the Alarm till after his own fruitless Efforts to suppress the Flame, which however was restrain'd from spreading beyond the room, where it began, tho' the Mischief done there by Water as well as Fire is computed at 600 £. The Destruction fell chiefly on the Journals of the House of Commons &amp; Chambers's Encylopaedia. But the Transactions , of which between thirty &amp; forty sheets are printed off, escap'd unhurt. 6 Mr. Sam: Richardson is reputed to have died worth fifteen thousand Pounds; in which Sum is probably included 3000 £. given to his eldest Daughter married to a Surgeon at Bath. His Widow, besides an Annuity of 40 £ during her Widowhood from the Stationers Company is, according to the Custom of the City, intitled to a third of his fortune. He had form'd a Plan for carrying on his Busines after his Death for the benefit of his Family: but they have no Inclination to continue it, &amp; seem resolv'd to part with his spacious &amp; well furnish'd Printing House as soon as a proper Offer shall be made them. 7 Birch, though a friend and admirer of Richardson, remarked unsympathetically some weeks later: "Sam. Richardson's Will is a real Curiosity, as I am inform'd by all, that have seen it, being an odd Compound of Vanity and Spleen." 8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV One of the oddest contemporary references to Richardson appears in an obscure tale of low life in London, The Life and Imaginations of Sally Paul , which bears the imprint, "London: Printed for S. Hooper, at Caesar's-Head, near the New Church, in the Strand. 1760." The caption-title is "The History of Sarah Paul." I do not find this title recorded in any bibliography, but there is a copy in the Fondren Library, The Rice Institute. Sally, a prostitute, lives with an old man, and the wretched couple are trying to eke out an existence in the City. She is disguised as a boy. The winter preceding, and while we were on the London side of the water, we were in the same manner distressed for work, he then applied to Mr. Richardson, the parliament printer, in Fleet-street, and worked for him at the Press a considerable time, in a business quite new to him, while I had the honour to attend the same press in the capacity of a devil, and I do assure you executed my part with as much dexterity as any imp in those black regions could pretend to. 9 The reference to parliamentary printing and the location of the press 'in Fleet-street' (really in White Lion Court, running from Fleet Street to Salisbury Square) identify the printing house of the novelist, who thus makes an appearance in a work of which he would have heartily disapproved.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Msgazine and Other Contributions by Mary Russell Mitford and Thomas Noon Talfourd by William A. Coles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the course of his long friendship with Mary Russell Mitford, Thomas Noon Talfourd acted at times as an unofficial (and unpaid) literary agent for the struggling, hard-pressed authoress, and he was always her close confidant on literary matters. Accordingly, the unpublished correspondence between the two adds much new information to the publication history of Miss Mitford and many new items to the bibliographies of both. The following information derives from letters written during the first five years of their correspondence. 1 In March, 1821, soon after Miss Mitford had begun her professional career as a writer, Talfourd suggested that she contribute prose and poetry to periodicals. Thereafter he transmitted sonnets which she sent him to the New Monthly Magazine . The following is a list of sonnets by her that I have been able to identify in that magazine: "Sonnet. Written in a Blank Paper Book Given to the Author by a Friend," I (1821), 387. "Sonnet. On a Landscape by Mr. Hofland" (published in Dramatic Scenes 2 as "On Leaving a Favourite Picture"), I (1821), 392. "Sonnet on Visiting Donnington Castle . . . ," I (1821), 532. "To a Friend on Her Birth-Day," II (1821), 369. "On an Intended Removal from a Favourite Residence," IV (1822), 81. "Sonnet" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "On a Beautiful Woman"), IV (1822), 192. All were later printed in the Museum (see below) and are in Dramatic Scenes . As the lists below demonstrate, Miss Mitford was somewhat extravagantly given to reprinting in magazines and annuals poetry already printed in other magazines and later still to be gathered in a volume. Talfourd also sold four of Miss Mitford's prose articles to the New Monthly in 1821: "Field Flowers," I, 648-650. "Richmond," II, 56-59. "On the Comedies of Thomas May," II, 70-75. "On Letters and Letter-Writers," II, 142-146. These were the only articles published by her in that magazine until 1824, when two of her prose sketches, "The Touchy Lady" (XI, 348-351), and "Rosedale and Its Tenants" (XI, 521-528), were printed there. The former was later reprinted in Our Village , second series (1826), and the latter was revised and reprinted as "Rosedale" in Our Village , fourth series (1830). Talfourd also submitted Miss Mitford's dramatic sketches to the London Magazine , though his success in that quarter was slighter. Two, however, were accepted: "Emily, A Dramatic Sketch" (III [May, 1821], 499-505), and "Theodore and Bertha, a Dramatic Sketch" (IV [September, 1821], 256-265). Both were later reprinted in Dramatic Scenes , though the title of the latter was changed to "The Fawn," and the name of the character Theodore was changed to Leopold . Mr. Elmer Brooks, in an unpublished Harvard University thesis, "Studies in the London Magazine" (1954), p. 406, incorrectly ascribes to Miss Mitford "Count Julius, A Dramatic Sketch," printed in the June, 1821, issue of the magazine (pp. 622-627), and signed "φορμιο." But from Miss Mitford's letter to Talfourd of June 21, 1821 ( R ), it is clear that Talfourd has told her, in answer to her inquiry in a letter of June 8 ( H ), that the author of the piece was George Croly. On April 27, 1822, appeared the first issue of a new weekly, the Museum , which was printed by Abraham John Valpy, the son of Dr. Richard Valpy, headmaster of Reading School and a close friend of the Mitfords. Miss Mitford was asked to contribute, and she did so, though reluctantly, because the pay that John Valpy offered was very low. On March 31 she writes to Talfourd: "those papers which nobody else will take he shall have—which is serving him pretty much in his own style" ( H ). But even this "style" of publication eventually tried her patience, for in a letter of April 13 [?], 1823, she writes to Talfourd that she has given "warning" to the Museum , since she has only received ten pounds for nearly all the poetry she ever published there, or, as she puts it, "about the rate of sixpence a sonnet ( H )." The following is a list of her works which I have been able to identify in the Museum : *"Bridal Song" [from "Fiesco"], I (May 25, 1822), 73. "The Masque of the Seasons. From 'Fiesco,' an Unpublished Tragedy," I (June 8, 1822), 106. "The Bridal Eve: A Dramatic Scene," I (June 29, 1822), 155-156. "Englefield House, The Seat of R. Benyon de Beauvoir, Esq.," I (July 13, 1822), 188. *"Ode to St. Valentine," the same. "Agnes: A Dramatic Scene" (published in Dramatic Scenes and Forget Me Not [1825] as "Alice. A Dramatic Scene"), I (July 20, 1822), 204-205. *"Young Greyhounds Playing in the Snow.—A Winter Scene," I (August 10, 1822), 251. "Independence," the same, pp. 251-252. *"Stanzas" ["O take these tell-tale eyes away"], I (August 31, 1822), 301. *"Sonnet on Reading a Ballad of Wordsworth," the same. *"The Star of Evening," the same. "Song" ["Sweet is the balmy evening hour"], the same. "Sonnet.—To Miss J.," I (September 21, 1822), 348-349. "Song" ["Evening's richest colors glowing"], I (October 19, 1822), 412. *"Sonnet: Written after Reading Dr. Currie's Life of Burns," the same. "Sonnet" ["Within my little garden is a flower"] (in Dramatic Scenes it is dated 1825), I (November 2, 1822), 442. *"On the Death of a Friend [Mrs. James Perry]," I (December 7, 1822), 522. *"Lines, Written after Reciting the Foregoing Poem to Some Young Ladies, Who had recently Lost Their Mother," the same. "Sonnet Written in a Blank Paper Book, Given to the Author by a Friend," I (December 14, 1822), 538. "On Visiting Donnington Castle, Said to Have Been the Latest Residence of Chaucer, and Famous for Its Resistance to the Parliamentary Army during the Civil Wars," the same. "The Fishing Seat: White-knights," I (December 21, 1822), 556. "On a 'Study from Nature,' by Mr. Haydon," the same. "On Leaving a Favourite Landscape" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "On Leaving a Favourite Picture"), the same. "On an Intended Removal from a Favourite Residence," II (January 4, 1823), 13. "To a Friend:—on Her Birth-day," the same. "Sonnet" ["Look where she sits in languid loveliness"] (published in Dramatic Scenes as "On a Beautiful Woman"), II (January 11, 1823), 27. "Sonnet" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "To My Mother Sleeping"), II (January 18, 1823), 43. "New Year's Eve. To a Friend" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "New Year's Day, 1819. To Mrs. Dickinson"), II (February 1, 1823), 74. *"To a Beautiful Boy on His Birthday; with a Garland of Woodbine," II (March 8, 1823), 155. "Sonnet" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "Written after a Visit from Some Friends"), II (March 22, 1823), 186. "Weston Grove. A Descriptive Poem," II (March 29, 1823), 203-205. "Independence" and "Sweet is the balmy evening hour" were first published in the Poetical Register for 1810-1811 , pp. 241-243 and p. 184, respectively. All the poems, except those starred, were reprinted in Dramatic Scenes , and some reappeared later in annuals too. Miss Vera Watson, in her biography, Mary Russell Mitford (1949), p. 109, says that "Weston Grove," the last poem listed, was published in 1812, but was "written previously." However, the poem, which is in praise of the estate of William Chamberlayne, M.P., near Southampton, was probably written in 1812, soon after Miss Mitford's visit there. In a letter to Sir William Elford, dated September 3, 1812, she says that she has just returned from Southampton, and in another letter to him on October 27, 1812, she refers to her description of Netley Abbey in the poem. 3 The poem was sent to Chamberlayne, who acknowledged receiving it "some weeks since" in a letter dated November 7, 1812. 4 It was probably, then, written in September or early October at the latest. I can also find no evidence of its publication in 1812. Indeed, when Miss Mitford first sent it to Talfourd, together with other poetry supposedly destined for the New Monthly , in a letter of March 9, 1821, she told him that she had written it so long before that she had utterly forgotten it until she found "the manuscript" in searching for some sonnets ( H ). In May, 1822, the Lady's Magazine changed hands, and the following month Talfourd started to contribute reviews and critical articles there. In September he arranged for Miss Mitford to publish there regularly too, and it was in this magazine, of course, that her Our Village sketches first began to appear. The following is a list of her works which I have been able to identify in the magazine: "Claudia's Dream; A Dramatic Sketch" (published in Dramatic Scenes as "The Siege"), III (September 30, 1822), 462-466. "Lucy," the same, pp. 478-483. "Boarding School Recollections. No. I. The French Teacher," III (October 31, 1822), 545-551. "Boarding School Recollections. No. II. My School-fellows," III (November 30, 1822), 600-605. "Our Village," III (December 31, 1822), 645-650. "Boarding School Recollections. No. III. The English Teacher," the same, pp. 672-677. "The Talking Lady," IV (January 31, 1823), 16-19. "Hannah," the same, pp. 25-28. "Walks in the Country, No. I [Frost and Thaw]," IV (February 28, 1823), 92-94.

All the dramatic scenes and "Antigone" were reprinted in Dramatic Scenes , and the prose sketches were all reprinted in the Our Village series. In a note to the "Ode to Genius" Miss Mitford says that the poem is published for the first time, but it had previously been printed in the Poetical Register for 1810-1811 , pp. 116-121. At the end of 1825, after the successful appearance of the first collected volume of Our Village sketches during the preceding year, Miss Mitford again began to contribute her work to various publications. I have been able to find the following works by her in the New Year annuals of that season: "Alice. A Dramatic Scene," Forget Me Not; A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1826 , pp. 5-17 (previously printed in the Museum as "Agnes"). "A Village Sketch [Jack Hatch]," the same, pp. 304-315. "The Vicar's Maid; a Village Story," The Amulet (1826), pp. 130-146. "Sonnet on Mr. Hofland's Picture of Jerusalem at the Time of the Crucifixion," the same, p. 329. "My Godfather," Literary Souvenir (1826), pp. 393-406. "The Lady of Beechgrove. A Sketch," Friendship's Offering . A Literary Album (1826), pp. 91-101 (later reprinted as "The Tenants of Beechgrove"). The sonnet was later reprinted in Dramatic Scenes , and all the sketches were reprinted in Our Village , second series (1826). She also contributed to John Thelwall's new magazine, the Panoramic Miscellany , which began on January 31, 1826. I can give no account of her work in this magazine, however, since there is no copy of it in this country. Its career was short-lived though, for in a letter to Barbara Hofland, dated September 20, 1826, 5 Miss Mitford writes that Thelwall's magazine has stopped, and that he owes her between seven and eight pounds. Thelwall had apparently founded the Panoramic in opposition to Cox and Baylis' Monthly Magazine , to which Miss Mitford also became a regular contributor. I have been able to identify the following sketches by her in the magazine: "An Old Gipsy: A Village Sketch," I (January, 1826), 13-17. "The Young Gipsy: A Village Sketch. No. II," I (February, 1826), 129-134. "Old Neighbors Sketches. No. I. An Admiral on Shore," I (April, 1826), 377-385. "Village Sketches. No. III. The Seventh Son of a Seventh Son," I (June, 1826), 575-580. (largely rewritten and reprinted as "Lost and Found"). "Old Neighbors Sketches. No. II. A Quiet Gentlewoman," II (September, 1826), 274-279. "Village Sketches. No. IV. A New Married Couple," II (December, 1826), 584-587. "Village Sketches. No. V. A Christmas Party," III (January, 1827), 46-51. "Village Sketches. No. VI. The Two Valentines," III (March, 1827), 263-266. "Country Rambles. No. I. Wheat-Hoeing," III (May, 1827), 484-488. "Village Sketches. No. VII. Whitsun-Eve," IV (July, 1827), 46-48. "Village Sketches. No. VIII. Our Maying," IV (August, 1827), 155-159. "Village Sketches. No. IX. The Bird-Catcher," V (February, 1828), 130-134. "Village Sketches. No. X. The Mole Catcher," V (April, 1828), 365-368. "Village Sketches. No. XI. The Shaw," VI (October, 1828), 387-390. "Village Sketches. No. XII. Hannah Bint," VI (December, 1828), 572-576. All were eventually reprinted in the Our Village series. Because of their friendship with Dr. Valpy, Miss Mitford and Talfourd did some helpful "puffing" for the biennial production of Greek plays held at the Reading School. Miss Mitford was asked to review the performance of Orestes and the last three acts of King John , and her article appears in the Reading Mercury of October 22, 1821. She accepted the task, not knowing that Talfourd was writing an account of the plays for the Champion . His account appears in the October 28, 1821, issue of that paper (pp. 678-679). It is followed by his "Epilogue to the Orestes of Euripides," later reprinted in Poems, Odes, Prologues, and Epilogues, spoken on public occasions at Reading School , ed. Richard Valpy (London, 1826), pp. 189-191. To atone for seeming to intrude on his prerogative (Talfourd had attended Reading School and was always deeply attached to it), Miss Mitford had the Champion article reprinted in the Reading Mercury on November 5. Talfourd also seems to have written another account (or reprinted the one in the Champion ) in a Windsor paper, presumably the Windsor and Eton Express ; but this I have not seen. Later, in 1824, Miss Mitford was much charmed by Henry Richardson's performance of Admetus in the school's production of Alcestis , and wrote a sonnet to him. It appears in the Reading Mercury of October 25, and was later reprinted in Dramatic Scenes , pp. 296-297. Talfourd's connection with the Reading School was no doubt responsible for his publication in the Pamphleteer , which was printed by Abraham John Valpy. Robert Newdick, Talfourd's most complete bibliographer, lists six articles by him in that periodical from 1813 to 1815. 6 However, Miss Mitford identifies as his another unsigned Pamphleteer article, "A Reply to the Most Popular Objections to Public Schools, with Particular Reference to the Tyrocinium of Cowper" (III [August, 1814], 103-130). Newdick also did not know of Talfourd's association with the Lady's Magazine , which he kept a closely guarded secret. Furthermore, following Newdick, Professor William S. Ward has said that Talfourd's career as a critic of poetry was virtually at an end in 1820. 7 Actually Talfourd published some of his most interesting criticism of contemporary poetry in the Lady's Magazine , for which during the space of about a year he wrote almost exclusively, except for dramatic reviews and non-literary work published elsewhere. There follows a list of articles probably by Talfourd in that magazine: A review of Sir Walter Scott, The Fortunes of Nigel , III (June 30, 1822), 281-290. A review of the Rev. H. H. Milman, Belshazzar; a Dramatic Poem , the same, 323-326. "On the Genius and Writings of Moore," III (July 31, 1822), 337-339; concluded, III (August 31, 1822), 427-431. A review of Sir Walter Scott, Halidon Hill; a Dramatic Sketch from Scottish History , III (July 31, 1822), 382-386. A review of The Poetical Works of Barry Cornwall , III (September 30, 1822), 449-456. A review of Harry Stoe Van Dyk, Theatrical Portraits, with Other Poems , the same, pp. 488-492. "Bernard Barton's Poetry," III (October 31, 1822), 513-519. A review of The Liberal. Verse and Prose from the South , the same, pp. 565-569. "Works Attributed to a Lady of Fashion," a review of The Magic Lantern; or Sketches of Scenes in the Metropolis, Sketches and Fragments , and Journal of a Tour through the Netherlands to Paris , III (November 30, 1822), 577-581. A review of Richard Dagley and the Rev. George Croly, Gems, principally from the Antique, . . . with Illustrations in Verse , the same, pp. 618-621. A review of Lord Byron, Werner; a Tragedy , III (December 31, 1822), 662-668. "The Living Poets. No. I. Lord Byron," IV (January 31, 1823), 3-10; concluded, IV (April 30, 1823), 198-203. A review of Lord Byron, "Heaven and Earth, A Mystery," in The Liberal , No. II, and Thomas Moore, The Loves of the Angels, a Poem , IV (January 31, 1823), 19-23. A review of German Popular Stories, Translated from the Kinder-und-Haus Marchen, collected by MM. Grimm , the same, pp. 28-31. A review of The Entail, or the Lairds of Grippy , the same, pp. 44-46. A review of W. F. Deacon, The Innkeeper's Album , IV (February 28, 1823), 84-85. A review of Sir Walter Scott, Peveril of the Peak , the same, pp. 85-91. "Biographical and Critical Sketch of the Late Mr. Kemble," IV (March 31, 1823), 170-177. A review of Mary Russell Mitford, Julian, a Tragedy , the same, pp. 178-180. A review of George Burges, The Son of Erin, or the Cause of the Greeks , IV (April 30, 1823), 221-223. In addition to the articles on Byron in the Lady's Magazine , Talfourd also wrote a review of Sardanapalus, The Two Foscari , and Cain in the London Magazine (V [January, 1822], 66-71), which has not hitherto been credited to him. During the years of their close friendship Talfourd often tried to help Miss Mitford by giving her kind notice in print. Indeed sometimes she seemed to think that praise could flow from no other pen, and she erroneously attributed flattering reviews to him. In a letter of June 22, 1823 ( H ), she thanks Talfourd for writing a biographical sketch which follows her engraved portrait in the June, 1823, edition of the magazine La Belle Assemblée (the portrait is on p. 238, and the sketch on pp. 239-240). As the ascription is not contradicted in later letters, it is probably correct.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Publication of Leigh Hunt's Imagination and Fancy by David Bonnell Green</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the pleasantest minor incidents in the history of nineteenth-century publishing is that connected with Leigh Hunt's critical anthology Imagination and Fancy . George Smith, telling the often-quoted story in his delightful reminiscences, recollects that as a young publisher he encountered the manuscript of the work lying on the table of his friend Thomas Powell, who declared, "I advanced £40 to Leigh Hunt on the security of that manuscript and I shall never see my money again'"; that he nevertheless took it home and read it, offering £40 to Powell for the manuscript; that he obtained it, took it to Hunt and paid him "an additional £60" for the copyright, whereupon Hunt, enchanted with his generosity, exclaimed rapturously, "'You young prince!'" 1 There is no reason to doubt the truth of Smith's account, but he tells the story from his own side of the affair, and not surprisingly an element of distortion has crept in, with Hunt playing his familiar role, light-hearted, gay—and rather inept. An impractical man. But Smith was prepared to see Hunt in this way because he knew Hunt's reputation. 2 The following letter from Hunt to Charles Ollier, previously unpublished, shows that in reality the situation was very different. Since Hunt needed money he took pains to make his manuscript acceptable, but he clearly recognized its value and was prepared to ask a fair price for it. Ollier, to whom Hunt entrusted the work, had, after a career as publisher, become a journalist, publisher's reader, and literary agent. Although his relationship with Hunt had not always been smooth, at least from 1830 onwards the two men were close friends; 3 it is to Ollier in his capacity of literary agent that Hunt writes here. 4 Kensington March 5. 1843 My dear Ollier, I enclose, for your benignity, the papers necessary for Mr. Longman, 5 to whom I wrote as agreed on. " Preface " has a dull, uninviting sound; so I have divided what I intended for one into two parts, the first explaining the Object &amp; Plan of the Work (which is a thing that readers like to understand) and the second answering a question as to the nature &amp; peculiar properties of Poetry, (which are things also, I should think, that most people would be glad to know, &amp; not many actually do). In the conclusion of this latter article I have taken care to identify it justly with the work, so as not to seem a thing isolated, or arbitrarily put in; and I trust that 6 the perusal thereof will not displease you, since (modesty apart) it has pleased myself. The rest are list of General Contents;—the Spenser extracts , preceded by a careful criticism &amp; a biographical sketch (written however, I assure you, with great pains of condensation, &amp; not without particulars of my own) and the Coleridge extracts , with a much shorter biographical notice (for reasons which you will see, &amp; which I think both you &amp; Mr. Longman will approve) but a not very short criticism, the musical parts of which I recommend to the relish of your Fluteship; 7 and am, my dear Ollier, Your very thankful &amp; faithful friend, Leigh Hunt. P. S. An un smoky room shall be ready &amp; warm for your reception tomorrow evening, or any future evening on which you may come, should it not suit you to go out to-morrow. Also divers anticipative &amp; amazing luxuries of flesh-meats, should it suit you to carnosify with your tea; especially as I hope you will be early to tea, in order that we may have a proper chatty &amp; book-loving interval before supper. And so Heaven prosper all our undertakings, &amp; enable us to compare notes of comfort twenty years hence under the trellice of our respective suburban elegancies on evenings in May, in the hearing of nightingales. Pray let Mr. Longman understand that the selections from modern poets will not be so great as to tread upon the irritable toes of property &amp; that there will be none from living poets, unless he should particularly desire it. What do you think on that point? Do not trouble yourself to answer this question by a letter. I am ashamed to give you the trouble I do,—no, not ashamed, considering your friendship; but still, the friendlier you are, the more I must consider your time. If the extracts from Spenser are too long, they can be shortened; but it is to be recollected what a large &lt;witer&gt; writer, he was, &amp; that few poets will demand extracts so long. I shall not give such large abstracts from the beginning of Milton as I spoke to you, but the finest passages from all his poem[s]. I send Coleridge with Spenser, in order that Mr. Longman may see specimens of both &lt;as he&gt; ancient &amp; modern poets, &amp; observe how careful I am in managing points connected with religious controversy &amp; politics. I told Mr. L. in my letter, that I could be ready to go to press in a month from this time, if he liked it.— You will not mention money of course, till all else is agreed on; &amp; then you can postpone it, if you please, to one meeting more , should that not be too much for you. But pray use your own judgment in this as in all other matters. In fact, the more I want money, the more I am ashamed to speak of it. God send I may need no such shame by &amp; by. My biographies &amp; introductory criticisms are written in a good large hand enough; but I fear many of the notes are in handwriting so small, as to trouble a reader. However, Longman may probable [ sic ] not care to read beyond a certain taste of the thing.— The notes are at the back of the pages. Longman presumably refused Imagination and Fancy , for he did not publish it. Perhaps Hunt asked for too much money; perhaps the prospects of success with it appeared to be dim. In any case, after Longman's refusal Hunt apparently entrusted it to another friend, Thomas Powell, who also acted now and then as literary agent. Powell may deliberately have left the volume on the table for Smith to see, or perhaps he invented the story of the £40 debt to play on Smith's sympathy; he could be unscrupulous if he chose. 8 Be that as it may, he was able to manage the arrangements with regard to Imagination and Fancy to Hunt's satisfaction. But his later dealings with Smith on Hunt's behalf were a failure. 9 Powell may have been a shrewd negotiator, but he could not drive as hard a bargain as Hunt wished him to in the case of Wit and Humour , the second volume of the projected series of critical anthologies. Hunt was without doubt genuinely pleased at the terms Smith offered him for Imagination and Fancy , but he can hardly have been surprised or overjoyed. Underneath his apparent flightiness and gaiety was a hard core. He was not an impractical man, and the new letter, although it does not contradict Smith's account, does provide a more accurate picture of Hunt's part in the events preceding the publication of Imagination and Fancy .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Howells Bibliography: A "Find" and a Clarification by Edwin H. Cady</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before the publication of A Bibliography of William Dean Howells by William M. Gibson and George Arms, with its clear and impressively accurate record of "about 200 books wholly or in part by Howells and 1200 periodical pieces," Howells bibliography was a tangled morass. Now one may depend confidently on a reliable map for the exploration of Howells—and may take a sporting pleasure in poking into the few odd corners left. Among the six "highly desirable" items "not found" by Gibson and Arms are two Italian publications, 1 a piece of sheet-music, Don't Wake the Children , and a History of the Western Reserve . The purpose of this note is to remove these last two items from the "not found" list, leaving only "the MacDowell lyrics . . . and the 1916 edition of Garland's They of the High Trails " 2 to be searched for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Don't Wake the Children turned up in the piano-seat of the home in Jefferson, Ohio, of a lady who said she had once played and sung it for Howells himself. 3 The bibliographical description, following the method of Gibson and Arms, would be: [Ornament] Don't wake | the | children [ Ornament ] 40 cts | [ Ornament ] Words by | William Dean Howells | Music by Clarence Wilber Bowers | [Ornament] Published by | J. A. Howells &amp; Co. | Jefferson O. | Designed by | Franklin H. White | Copyright 1895. J. A. Howells &amp; Co. Collation : p. [8], 14 x 11 inches: [1] title-page; [2] blank; [3] first page of words and music; [4-6] numbered 3-5; [7-8] missing from my copy, though obviously there originally as back half of title page sheet. Title-page extremely florid: purple ink; words separated by complex, leafy ornaments; title in heavy ruled box which becomes simulated scrolls at right edge; this enclosed in box simulating massive vines, with flowers and iris-like leaves at bottom; in upper left-hand corner this balloons to include vignette of husband and wife in evening clothes bending over sleeping boy and girl. Howells' poem, not elsewhere printed, was a product of the reflowering of his impulse to verse in the late '80's and early '90's. The reference to the death of his daughter Winifred, which had profound effects on his psyche and his art, dates it as after March 3, 1889. Perhaps the poem was a reject from the gathering of his new poetic output published in October 1895 as Stops of Various Quills . 4 DON'T WAKE THE CHILDREN 5 When we used to come home late at night, (Happy young father and mother!) From the concert or party, or play, Do you mind, dear, how under the light, Turned low in the hall, we would stay, To whisper and caution each other, 6 Don't wake the children! Then softly we climed [ sic ] the long stair, (Happy young father and mother!) And on thro' the darkness we crept To the door of the dim chamber where, Together the little ones slept; And we kissed them and whispered each other 6 Don't wake the children! They grew up long ago and are gone, (Lonely old father and mother!) In the wide world of women and men, All the sweet little dreamers save one, Who has never ceased dreaming since then, And we never need whisper each other, Don't wake the children. 6 But still, when we come home at night, (Foolish old father and mother!) From concert, or party, or play, I falter, and under the light, I wait, as if still we must stay To whisper and caution each other Don't wake the children. 6 For they cannot go out of our love, (Always their father and mother!) They are children there yet to this day, Beneath the earth's breast or above, Wherever they rest or they stray, Just as then when we whispered each other, We kissed them and whispered each other, Don't wake the children! Howells was not a major poet, though he sometimes was a sound and moving minor one. This verse, however, is far from his best, strengthening the suspicion that it was a cull from the Stops of Various Quills collection. Clarence Wilber Bowers' music for it is, unfortunately, inferior to the verse. Bowers, an "organist, conductor, composer, teacher," may have made contact with Howells either through Ohio relationships, for he was born in Norwalk, Ohio, or through New England, where he studied at the New England Conservatory and taught at Andover Theological Seminary before beginning a complex westward trek of teaching stints in small colleges which seems to have ended in San Diego. 7 In any case, he wrote a rather catchy tune in the tradition of "She's Only a Bird In a Gilded Cage" which is sadly out of key with Howells' poem in spite of musical directions such as " Con moto e patetico " and " Con dolore ." Without poetic distinction, "Don't Wake the Children" does have a certain biographical significance to underscore its bibliographical rarity. In the mode of domestic sentimentality popular in the nineteenth century, it seeks to arouse in its audience emotions of a quality and an excess upon which Howells would normally have turned his back. Perhaps his lapse into sentimentality shows him trying to heal the wounds to his wife and himself—and to the united psyche of their marriage—caused by the protracted illness and shocking death of their lovely daughter and first child. From that point of view there is a pathos Howells could not have intended in the sight of the old realist and ironist seeking refuge in sentimentality from fate's triumph over him—and perhaps the pathos is deepened by the fact that somehow he was persuaded that such an instrument of autotherapy would make a successful popular song. The publisher, "J. A. Howells &amp; Co.," was of course Howells' elder brother, Joseph Alexander Howells, who had continued the family newspaper and printing business in Jefferson, Ohio. With his usual familial conscientiousness Howells threw advantages in the way of J. A. Howells &amp; Co. whenever he could. It may be speculated that Joe, who had once made good money publishing songs, recruited the composer and Will acquiesced in permitting them to use a poem he did not wish to include in his latest volume for whatever the venture would bring. At any rate, the venture appears to have been a thorough failure. With an inferior poem, worse music, and J. A. Howells &amp; Co.'s handicaps in promoting and publishing it, perhaps that failure was foregone. In any event, it seems to have been so thorough that, to the best of my knowledge, my crumbling copy of "Don't Wake the Children" is the only one extant.</field>

Thus p. 64 corrects the impression left by p. 7 that Howells wrote a lost history of the Western Reserve, and a potential ghost is laid. Gibson and Arms' item #10-E might better read: History of | the Western Reserve | by | Harriet Taylor Upton | H. G. Cutler | Editor of the Lewis Publishing Company | And a staff of leading citizens collaborated on | The counties and biographies. | Illustrated | Volume I | 1910 | The Lewis Publishing Company | Chicago | New York. Collation : three volumes continuously paginated, vol. I to p. 709, II to p. 1270, III to p. 1874. 7½ x 10⅜ inches: etc. Since Howells' letter forms a very brief part of the volume, and other volumes with Howells letters at least as long are not included by Gibson and Arms, there is reason to doubt that #10-E should appear at all. The only other thing the student of Howells should know is that there is not much reason for him to refer to Mrs. Upton's book. Her other materials and views upon Howells are of little worth. She edited his quite valuable letter to her of March 9, 1910, leaving out comments of some real biographical interest concerning his mother. The full text, that is, the holograph letter itself, is readily available to students at the Library of the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For light on these see E. H. Cady, "William Dean Howells in Italy: Some Bibliographical Notes," Symposium , VII (1953), 147-153. 2 W. M. Gibson and G. Arms, A Bibliography of William Dean Howells (1948), p. 7. 3 This information, as well as the sheet-music itself, came through Mr. Chet Lampson, editor of The Jefferson Gazette (successor to the Howells family newspaper, The Ashtabula Sentinel ) and expert Western Reserve historian, collector, and book-hunter. 4 Gibson and Arms, p. 45. 5 One cannot be sure, reconstructing it from its sheet-music divisions, that Howells' verses or even lines were precisely those given here. 6 These lines were repeated in the sheet-music, for purpose of the song-writer, not the poet, I think. 7 See International Who's Who in Music and Musical Gazetteer , ed. César Saerchinger (1918), p. 44.</field>
