      <field name="heading_text">Indexing the Periodical Literature of Anglo-American Bibliography by B. J. McMullin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his article 'The Periodical Literature of English and American Bibliography', 1 G. Thomas Tanselle provided a valuable service to bibliographers in identifying the major English-language periodicals 'containing material of bibliographical interest', both defunct and current, and in tabulating the years during which these periodicals have been 'covered' in nine indexing services. It was not Tanselle's purpose to describe the nature of the coverage, but it has seemed to me worth while to take his study that step further. What follows is a series of linked observations on the indexing of bibliographical periodicals designed to show how much is being indexed and how appropriately the indexing is being done. Because at the time of writing the latest volume of MHRA available covers the publications of 1974, in specifics the observations are in the main concerned with periodicals bearing a 1974 cover date. And they are confined to the four major bibliographical periodicals: The Book Collector , The Library , Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , and Studies in Bibliography , referred to as BC , Library , PBSA , and SB . I have confined myself to these four since, because they are the most widely indexed, they allow the greatest number of comparisons to be made; and because they are the major bibliographical periodicals they might be expected to show the indexing services at their best. Other abbreviations used are: ABHB ABHB . Annual Bibliography of the History of the Printed Book and Libraries BI Bibliographic Index BHI British Humanities Index EGLI Essay and General Literature Index HI Humanities Index IBZ Internationale Bibliographie der Zeitschriften-literatur aus allen Gebieten des Wissens LL Library Literature MHRA MHRA Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature MLA MLA International Bibliography</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I For publications of the years 1949 to 1972 bibliographers had the Selective Check List of Bibliographical Scholarship published annually in SB . For most of those years it was the only international index which took bibliography as its sole concern, though it was limited to indexing comprehensively the major periodicals (chiefly Anglo-American), supplemented by a leavening of entries that had come to the compilers' attention. The degree of selectivity involved may be gauged by a comparison with ABHB : with a similar scope (see next section) ABHB has always indexed at least three times the number of items each year, even before United States publications were included. In terms of subject access the utility of the SB lists was reduced by the method of arrangement: by scholar under five broad headings. The closest that SB ever came to providing subject access to the items indexed was in the 'Index to Bibliographical Scholarship' produced for the collections of reprints, covering the years 1949-55 and 1956-62. But even then a 'somewhat despotic method of entry was decided on since reading all of the articles to determine their true or complete subjects was beyond the power of the index compilers', so that the subject entries in the index are those 'revealed in the title .' (1949-55, p. iii). The decision to abandon the SB lists was taken in order to avoid 'the duplication that would result with the proposals in the Annual Bibliography of the History of the Printed Book and Libraries to expand its coverage with the fourth volume, of 1973' ( SB , 28 [1975], 332) to include publications of the United States. The decision was justified on the grounds both of scope, 2 and of performance. A comparison of the indexing of BC and Library for 1972 (the last year covered by SB ) reveals different emphases in items selected for indexing— SB towards English and American literature, ABHB towards book production—but the overlap is considerable. The only qualification about accepting ABHB might have been its tendency to eschew anything with a taint of manuscript (see further below). It is pertinent to ask how well ABHB has performed since it has had the field to itself; one answer can be got by comparing its performance for the period 1970-1972 with that for the period 1973-1975. Over the six years the scope of ABHB has not changed. But as the number of countries covered has increased the number of periodicals indexed (or at least considered for indexing) has risen: 802(1970), 972 (1971), 1132(1972), 1390(1973—United States publications now included), 1531(1974), 1527(1975). The last two figures are arrived at by counting the list of periodicals; in both years the Introduction claims a figure of 4000, which would imply a productivity of about one entry per title every two years. In the same period the numbers of entries (taking the final entry number and disregarding additions and deletions within the sequence) have been: 2489(1970), 2541(1971), 2858(1972), 3407(1973), 2733(1974), 2486(1975). The first three might be compared with the corresponding SB figures: 480(1970), 503(1971), 613(1972). The figures for entries are misleading in that in 1970 and 1971 multiple entries were liberally provided when items might lend themselves to indexing under various heads, whereas from 1972 they are fewer, alternative points of access being provided—woefully inadequate though it is—by a second index, Geographical and Personal Names. I estimate the number of discrete items indexed each year to be, therefore: 1500 - (1970), 1500 - (1971), 2500(1972), 3000 + (1973), 2500 + (1974), 2200 + (1975). In terms of the average number of discrete items indexed for each periodical title, productivity has fluctuated: 1.8(1970), 1.6(1971), 2.2(1972), 2.1(1973), 1.7(1974), 1.5(1975). (These figures are slightly inflated since no account has been taken of the fact that by no means all entries in ABHB are for periodical articles.) Summary of ABHB figures 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 Number of periodicals in ABHB list 802 972 1132 1390 1531 1527 Average productivity of periodicals indexed in ABHB 1.8 1.6 2.2 2.1 1.7 1.5 Number of entries in ABHB 2489 2541 2858 3407 2733 2486 Estimate of number of discrete items indexed in ABHB 1500 - 1500 - 2500 3000 + 2500 + 2200 + The change in the relationship between entries and discrete items can be gauged from the following figures for Library : 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 estimate of articles eligible for inclusion in ABHB 28 20 32 27 29 24 entries in ABHB 56 29 25 14 21 0 eligible articles omitted 0 2 7 15 8 24 In explanation of the figures for 1975 it should be added that there are no entries for BC either, so that there may be a mechanical reason for the two periodicals not being indexed. It may be that the 1975 issues will be indexed in ABHB for 1976, though experience should not make us sanguine. Part 4 of Library of 1974 was published late, 3 and was not indexed in ABHB for 1974; there are no entries for it in ABHB for 1975 either. The same issue of Library was missed by MLA for 1974, and only three of the four notes (and none of the three articles) were indexed in the volume for 1975. MHRA for 1974 includes only one note, and that entry comes latest in MHRA , suggesting that it was the only one able to be incorporated at a late stage—perhaps the volume for 1975 will catch the remaining items. It might be appropriate to observe here that retrospective entries are commonplace, not just in ABHB , which has a stated policy of including missed items in future issues: for example in SB for 1972 there are 29 entries for PBSA of 1968 and 21 for PBSA of 1970. Even with corrected figures for the periodicals lists it is clear that ABHB includes a large number of titles of low productivity. Nonetheless, it is of some comfort to know that unlikely periodicals (even Anglo-American) have been considered, since relevant articles therein would not generally have been caught by SB , e.g. from such periodicals as Scottish Labour History Society Journal , School Librarian , Ulster Folk-life , Transactions of the Anglesey Antiquarian Society and Field Club , and so on. Despite the consistency of the policy statement the practice of ABHB has in fact changed. To take the indexing of Library as an illustration: it is clear that from exhaustive indexing of articles within scope in its first two years ABHB has become more selective, and indeed erratic, as can be seen from the table above. The position for 1975 and part 4 of 1974 may still be retrieved in the volume for 1976, but for 1973 these are among the omissions: 'King James's Book of Bounty: from manuscript to print' 'Christopher Smart's 'Chaucerian' poems' 'Lewis Carroll's 1887 corrections to Alice ' 'Rowe's Shakespeare: an experiment of 1708' 'An Emendation to Johnson's Life of Pope ' In recent years there appears to have been an unstated decision to exclude textual studies, despite the statement in the introduction: 'Bibliography of the . . . analytical variety, i.e. . . . the use of inference based on book-production practice to throw light on textual history, falls naturally within the scope of this bibliography'. (6 [for 1975], p. viii) And it is obvious that the rule on manuscript studies is being applied mercilessly, so that relevant articles which happen to include questions of manuscript transmission or emendation are generally excluded. For coverage of material in PBSA and SB the abdication of SB in favour of ABHB has been calamitous. SB always did index itself exhaustively even when the occasional article was outside scope, and the articles and notes in PBSA were, with a few obvious exceptions, also indexed exhaustively. The change is exemplified by the bald figures for items indexed in ABHB for 1974: PBSA , 4 of 14 articles, 8 of 41 notes; SB 3 of 6 articles, 4 of 11 notes. (The comparable figures for BC are 22 of 28 and 6 of 13; for Library 18 of 24 and 3 of 7, all from parts 1-3.) Perhaps the figures are indicative of the literary bias of PBSA and SB , and a consequence of the rigid application of selection criteria rather than of the waywardness of the selection process. On the other hand perhaps the apparent difference in comprehensiveness of indexing between the British and American periodicals reflects rather the application of the criteria by the respective national committees—note, though, that the United States is represented by two former SB compilers. It must be allowed that ABHB still does contain a substantial number of entries (particularly for non-English-language materials); that it does scan an impressive range of titles; and that it does have a classification scheme (supplemented by indexes) which makes specific searches possible. On the other hand it is noticeably prone to error, and above all it simply does not index a large enough proportion of the contents of periodicals of central importance. I would venture to suggest that ABHB has declined in recent years to the point that it might reasonably be claimed that there is no longer a satisfactory index which takes bibliography as its sole concern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II As Tanselle notes, indexes devoted to bibliography are not the only sources: Of course, persons interested primarily in a particular author will find bibliographical articles gathered together with other material about that author in each year's issue of the MLA International Bibliography and the MHRA Annual Bibliography and in other guides to literary scholarship (p. 172). It is true that bibliographical articles will be found under author headings in indexes of literature such as MLA and MHRA , along with articles devoted to biography, criticism, etc. And one might wonder whether this is not as it should be: whether most articles have an author focus, and whether most users of indexes have an author interest. But both indexes have sections devoted to bibliographical topics which have no author focus: MLA : General Literature and Related Topics: V. Bibliographical MHRA : Bibliography (including sub-divisions Binding; Book Design and Illustration; Book Production, Printing, and Textual Studies; Collecting and the Library). MHRA in fact goes one better in providing a second entry in the Bibliography section for articles also entered in the author sequence; e.g. 'A Problem of textual transmission in the typescripts of Women in Love ' appears both under Twentieth Century—Authors—D. H. Lawrence and under Bibliography—Book Production, Printing, and Textual Studies. This facility—being able to search an index from an author point of view and a bibliographical point of view—constitutes a marked advantage over other indexes. Among the five comprehensive indexing services (see Summary Table at the end of this article) MLA and MHRA differ very little in their coverage of Library , PBSA and SB. MHRA indexes slightly fewer articles because of its careful application—perhaps too careful—of the 'English' criterion: the one item excluded from SB is 'English editions of French Contes de fées attributed to Mme D'Aulnoy'. Where the two indexes differ is in their coverage of BC : whereas MHRA applies the same criteria as it applies to the other three, MLA indexes only the most obvious of the articles and omits manifestly eligible notes, like 'Swinburne's Notes on Poems and Reviews (1866)'. MLA also indexes nothing from Part 4, though it was not published particularly late ( BHI was able to index it in issue 4 of 1974); and MLA for 1975 repairs none of the omissions. Tanselle underestimates MHRA when he writes 'A selection of English and American items can be located in the "Bibliography" section' (p. 169): even at the time of his writing it provided something more than a 'selection', and today it constitutes the best coverage for Anglo-American bibliography. MHRA has the advantage over MLA in its greater coverage and its dual entries. It has the incidental advantage, too, in being much more pleasant to use, being better laid out, in larger type, on more substantial paper and better printed. But one great advantage that MLA has is that in recent years it has appeared as much as two years ahead of MHRA . (It is reported that additional resources are to be devoted to the compilation of MHRA , so that delays for future volumes may be reduced.) In the long run MLA will also presumably have the edge in that its file is machine-readable and therefore capable of cumulation and manipulation for individual purposes. Nonetheless, the fact is that taken individually either MLA or MHRA is superior to any of the other three indexes which cover all four of the major Anglo-American bibliographical periodicals. (Whether the continued existence of both is justified is a question outside my brief.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Tanselle's comment on MLA and MHRA is followed by an observation about the desirability of indexing by bibliographical technique: But the fact that bibliographical articles do get listed in this way does not mean that a listing devoted exclusively to bibliographical articles is superfluous—an article on a particular writer, for example, may employ an unfamiliar bibliographical technique, and the bibliographical importance of the article may not be as readily recognized if it is not recorded in a bibliographical context. There is simply no substitute for a serial listing which takes bibliography as its field of knowledge (p. 172). Bibliographers would no doubt agree. But is there an index which provides access by bibliographical technique? The headings employed by MHRA and MLA have been noted above; the other comprehensive indexes offer little or no advance on them: ABHB is some advance in that it uses the much finer classification scheme adopted from Bibliography in Britain . But it still indexes by materials, author, or other definable 'subject', not by technique. LL (see below) offers no advance on the others: since physical bibliography is a peripheral subject for LL the relevant headings are particularly broad. IBZ (see below) similarly uses only the broadest of subject headings (alongside specific headings for persons etc.), such as Bibliographie (in its various significations), Typographie etc. In fact, the only index I am aware of which indexes by technique is the annual index to Library , and obviously its utility is confined to that title. (Note that the annual indexes to BC and PBSA are confined to proper names.) The nature of the different indexes may be judged by the entries assigned one article, for convenience taken from Library 30 (1975), part 1, 'Punctuation and the compositors of Shakespeare's Sonnets , 1609': Library : Bibliographic method : compositors' stints distinguished by punctuation and spacing habits, 1-24 Bodleian Library , Oxford, Shakespeare quartos watermarks, 11 Composition : Shakespeare Sonnets (1609), 1-24 English studies : W. Shakespeare, 1-24 Jackson , MacD. P. 'Punctuation and the compositors of Shakespeare's Sonnets , 1609', 1-24 Poetry : W. Shakespeare, 1-24 Punctuation : MacD. P. Jackson, 'Punctuation and the compositors of Shakespeare's Sonnets , 1609', 1-24 Shakespeare , William, Sonnets (1609), compositors' stints distinguished by punctuation and spacing, 1-24 Skeletons (in press work): W. Shakespeare Sonnets (1609), 2-3 Spelling : evidence for compositors' stints concurs with punctuation habits, 1-24 Watermarks : Shakespeare Sonnets (1609), 11n. (+ references to 26 authors referred to or quoted from) LL : Criticism, Textual Printing. History MLA : English Literature VI. Renaissance and Elizabethan. Shakespeare. Sonnets IBZ : Shakespeare, William [ MHRA ]: Bibliography. Book Production, Printing, and Textual Studies Sixteenth Century. William Shakespeare. Separate Works. The Sonnets If bibliography as a field of knowledge and indexing by technique were to be combined the resulting index would need to be akin to the annual indexes to Library . Whether it would be practicable to apply that level of indexing to a number of discrete items even as small as a thousand or so is perhaps a moot point. National ventures would be an appealing avenue, though the much-delayed Bibliography in Britain does not offer an encouraging example. An alternative avenue would be the indexing of a fixed list: perhaps the yet-to-be-published Bodleian Index to Certain Bibliographical Journals [of 1933-1965] could provide the basis for an on-going index. In the meantime MHRA must be regarded as the most satisfactory index to Anglo-American bibliography, supplemented—for the most recent two years—by MLA .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The profession of librarianship is fortunate in having its specialised indexing service, Library Literature (Tanselle, pp. 181-184), but its utility for bibliographers is severely limited. In the first place the list of periodicals indexed contains many which in fact are indexed only selectively. There is no published policy statement, and I am indebted to Mr. George F. Heise, Associate Director of Indexing Services, the H. W. Wilson Company, for supplying information about policy as it affects BC , Library , PBSA and SB. Policy is 'to index completely the periodicals listed', but there are so many exceptions that a user of LL simply has no means of knowing whether a particular issue of a particular title has been fully indexed, selectively indexed, or indexed not at all. The following notes are based on the information supplied by Mr. Heise: BC : All articles indexed; 'English bookbindings' given a blanket entry once a year; 'News and Comment' indexed selectively; Notes and Queries omitted. Library : All articles indexed; bibliographical notes indexed selectively; correspondence concerning articles or bibliographical notes which were indexed previously also indexed. PBSA : All articles indexed; notes indexed selectively: 'News, Notes, and Queries' indexed selectively. SB : Indexed selectively. Some indication of the degree of selectivity can be gauged from the Summary Table. The explanation for the disparity in treatment between the British publications on the one hand (fairly fully indexed) and the American on the other (sparsely indexed) may lie in the fact that other H. W. Wilson indexes cover the American ones comprehensively: HI indexes PBSA , and EGLI indexes SB . It would be easy to dismiss LL as contributing nothing to the indexing done by MLA and MHRA , but six items are indexed by LL and not by the other two: BC : 'Contemporary Collectors XLVII: Bibliotheca Franciscana' 'The Golden Compasses' (editorial) 'The Art of Writing' (editorial) Library : 'Some notes on the legibility of texts for the partially sighted' PBSA : 'The White House Transcripts' a letter from Fredson Bowers The selection for PBSA is probably to be explained by what appears to be a disposition towards big names, both as authors (here W. B. Todd and Fredson Bowers) and as subjects (Shakespeare and Milton are admitted from PBSA ). And LL is the only index to have caught up with the belated part 4 of Library —in August 1975: all three articles and two of the four notes are indexed, but not the letter. Where, in principle, LL stands to supplement the other indexes is in the inclusion of bibliographical articles from librarianship periodicals, for it is a feature of LL that it indexes comprehensively a number of 'mainstream' librarianship periodicals, even when occasionally the articles are outside scope. The major concerns of LL are librarianship, information science and publishing, and within these areas detailed subject headings are provided. For peripheral subjects—of which bibliography is one—only broad subject headings are provided. Consequently many of the articles of bibliographical interest included in LL are to be found under Criticism, Textual (often quite wrongly included there) and Printing. History. Since LL appears six times a year there may be virtue in such broad headings in that they can be used for current awareness purposes, but there would seem to be no other virtue. Indeed, one might ask why LL worries about BC , Library , PBSA and SB at all, or indeed about the whole area of bibliography.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Tanselle uses BC , 'the principal book-collecting journal in English at present', to illustrate the point that the journals associated with book-collecting and with bibliographical societies constitute the central core of general journals in the field of bibliography, 'for its editorials, bibliographical descriptions, notes and queries, and reviews maintain a high scholarly standard.' (p. 176) He goes on to say that 'because it began in 1952—that is, after the start of the SB checklists—there is no problem about its indexing.' To say that Tanselle overstates the case that 'there is no problem about its indexing' is not, however, to underestimate the difficulties that BC presents for indexers: (i) the editorials are unconventional in that they are usually indistinguishable from articles or review articles (e.g. of Voet's The Golden Compasses ), but—presumably because they are editorials and because they are generally unsigned—they are infrequently indexed. (ii) The 'News and Comment' section is a lengthy editorial piece comprising a continuous narrative on a series of topics. Some are regular pieces (on recent book auctions, booksellers' catalogues, and exhibitions), others items of news or notes on recent publications. Presumably because analysis of the section would be needed, material that might otherwise be indexed is in fact seldom indexed. (iii) Items in the Queries section may amount to no more than a request for information about the location of a lost manuscript or for assistance in identifying an anonymous work. But others are indistinguishable from Notes except that they end with a question of the kind 'Does anyone know of other examples?' Yet others are in fact answers to Queries and therefore absolutely indistinguishable from Notes. I.e. Queries may be of three kinds, but they are generally disregarded by the indexes, as if they were all of the first kind. In addition to the formal difficulties just outlined there are difficulties caused by the coverage of BC : its interest in manuscript studies places some articles outside the scope of ABHB , while the bibliophilic nature of others causes problems for MLA . But despite the difficulties it poses BC is covered by more indexes than the more centrally bibliographic Library . The over-all results are tabulated in the Summary Table, but some comments on particular indexes are offered here: ABHB : The fullest indexing of BC for 1974 is in ABHB , but because of its variability from year to year it may not be consistently the fullest. The exclusions are generally literary, though not all are to be explained on that score. Where ABHB stands out is in noticing the News and Comment section: besides the two blanket entries, Notes on recent book auctions and Notes on recent booksellers' catalogues, there are entries for the comment on Paul Morgan's Oxford Libraries outside the Bodleian and for the note on the Clover Hill private press—though at the same time it must be admitted that the section might have generated another 20 justifiable entries. MLA : BC constitutes a blind spot as far as MLA is concerned (see above). The five articles indexed are the most obviously literary of parts 1-3. MHRA : By comparison with MLA , MHRA performs particularly well (see above), and in its coverage of articles and notes is even fuller than ABHB . The omission of certain notes from part 4 (e.g. 'Beer at York Minster Library', which supplements an indexed article from part 2) suggests a decline in indexing efficiency. LL : There is no obvious pattern in the five exclusions. No items are indexed from News and Comment. (See further above.) IBZ : IBZ is discussed separately below. Suffice it to say here that for an index which seems to imply comprehensive coverage of the periodicals listed its showing is dismal. The selection defies explanation. BHI : BHI differs from ABHB , MLA and MHRA in indexing a fixed list of periodicals exhaustively, though for BC only the articles are covered. It does index several other bibliographical periodicals (e.g. Bodleian Library Record and the Transactions of the Cambridge and Edinburgh Bibliographical Societies), but not Library , so that its utility for British publications is to that extent limited. And in any case so much of BHI is devoted to economics, social sciences and weekly papers that even with Library bibliography would not constitute a very large element. There would be little argument with Tanselle's view of BC , that its 'editorials, bibliographical descriptions, notes and queries . . . maintain a high scholarly standard', but the 'problem about its indexing' remains. Except for the articles little of the material is indexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI Latterly the coverage of IBZ has declined from about 13,000 periodicals (Tanselle, p. 171) to 8105 (pars 2 of 1977), a few of which are in fact Festschriften or other works of composite authorship, such as Studies in the book trade in honour of Graham Pollard and Essays in the history of publishing in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the house of Longman, 1724-1974 . There are some qualifications to be made to Tanselle's list, 4 but the important thing to observe is that despite the general reduction even more bibliographical periodicals have been added in the past few years, including Bibliotheck , American Book Collector and Scholarly Publishing . Most importantly for the purposes of comparison, since pars 2 of 1974 PBSA has also been indexed. It is difficult to understand the objectives of IBZ , largely because it contains no policy statement. Though all fields of knowledge are supposed to be within its scope, in fact most medical periodicals were recently dropped, since the indexing of medical literature was already covered by specialized indexes. 5 Nor is there any statement about the basis for selecting items for indexing: the subtitle of IBZ ('covering all fields of knowledge') suggests that there is no basis in subject matter, and an innocent user might infer from the 'List of periodicals indexed' that those periodicals are fully indexed. But if bibliography is typical, in fact the indexing is highly selective: as the Summary Table shows, only a third of the articles from BC , Library , PBSA and SB of 1974 were indexed, and practically nothing from the notes etc. The selection of items simply defies explanation, at least as far as the outsider is concerned. The unpredictability of IBZ can be observed from a few comparisons: (i) from SB 'Press-variants and proofreading in the First Quarto of Othello (1622)' is indexed, but 'Justification and spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B' not. (ii) from Library 18 articles are not indexed, but one letter—on 'An Emendation to Johnson's Life of Pope '—is indexed. None of the other indexes includes this letter, but there is a second letter in the same issue on the same topic, and it is not indexed. (iii) from PBSA 'Proofreading in the shop of Valentine Simmes' is indexed, 'James Roberts' compositors in 1598' not. IBZ differs from ABHB , MLA and MHRA in that it does not index the publications of a particular time-span: each pars, which appears half-yearly, apparently includes whatever entries have been received from the copyists scattered throughout Germany. Broadwin's description of the indexing process is instructive: not only is the transcribing of entries done outside the editorial office, but the assignment of subject headings is done from the titles alone, and 'should a title prove to be totally nondescriptive or insufficient information be found in the reference works to determine exactly the subject matter of an article, it is temporarily laid aside.' The decentralisation of effort and what appears to be a casualness of attitude help to explain the characteristics of IBZ . First, there can be no guarantee that the indexed items from any one issue of a periodical will appear in the same pars, or that issues of a periodical will be indexed in the order that they were published: (i) items from parts 3 and 4 of BC are indexed partly in pars 2 of 1976, partly in pars 1 of 1977. (ii) the indexed items from the four parts of PBSA appear in IBZ in the order pars 1 of 1975, pars 1 of 1976, pars 1 of 1976 and pars 2 of 1975. Then there is the nature of the subject headings, which are very general unless a proper name is appropriate. Lack of subject limitation, combined with unpredictability in selection, means that several items from BC and Library not indexed by ABHB , MLA or MHRA are in fact indexed by IBZ : BC : 'Another Arrighi Manuscript: Douce 29' (article). Library : 'An Emendation to Johnson's Life of Pope ' (letter); 'The Journal of Sir Frederic Madden, 1852' (article); 'The Order and dating of the '1613' editions of Bacon's Essays ' (note). (The item from BC is also indexed by BHI ; the article and note from the belated part 4 of Library are also indexed by LL .) IBZ may index articles of bibliographical interest published in unlikely host periodicals, but its erratic treatment of known material puts it completely out of contention as a competitor with ABHB , MLA and MHRA .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII Several other indexes exist which are relevant to bibliographers, including three which—within certain limitations—index a fixed list of periodicals. In 1974 the Social Sciences and Humanities Index was replaced by Social Sciences Index and Humanities Index . The latter indexes one bibliographical periodical, PBSA , and for 1974 indexed all articles and notes (as did MLA ). 6 PBSA is also indexed by another H. W. Wilson index, LL , but selectively (it is particularly light on notes). The two differ also in the nature of their subject headings: whereas LL uses general headings for bibliographical topics HI is more specific, allowing proper names as subjects. The difference in indexing can be gauged from the treatment of 'David Hall and the Townshend Acts'; both have an author entry, and thereafter they index under these headings: Library Literature , June 1974 Printing. History Publishers and publishing. History Publishers and publishing. Newspapers Humanities Index , December 1974 Business and politics. United States Hall, David Journalism and politics Philadelphia. History. Colonial period Townshend acts, 1767 (All LL 's headings are accepted HI headings; indeed, in the same issues HI indexes 'The Editions of Malory in the early nineteenth century' under Publishers and publishing. Great Britain. History, and Bibliography. Editions, LL under Editions, Printing. History, and Printing. Great Britain. Additionally, the two indexes differ in their sub-arrangement: LL by author, HI by title.) SB also is indexed by a second Wilson index, EGLI , whose subtitle reads 'An Index to 4,010 essays and articles in 292 volumes of collections of essays and miscellaneous works'. 7 SB falls into neither category, but is included in EGLI , along with a number of other annuals like Shakespeare Survey , by the silly application of the definition of a periodical as a serial appearing more frequently than annually. HI is restricted to indexing periodical articles; SB is not a periodical; ergo SB is not eligible for indexing in HI , where it obviously belongs. EGLI bears the same relationship to LL in indexing SB as HI bears to LL in indexing PBSA : EGLI indexes SB exhaustively, and employs more specific headings, including proper names, but not the same headings as HI . BC is also indexed by BHI , which indexes the articles exhaustively but excludes everything else (see above). As a system BHI has many virtues. In the first place it indexes its periodicals more quickly than any of the other current indexes, and not only because it deals with the publications of a single country (the Wilson indexes do not consistently index American publications as quickly). And BHI is a subject index: unlike the Wilson indexes it does not waste space by providing author entries, but relegates authors to an index in the annual cumulation. (Are the Wilson indexes influenced by the arrangement of the dictionary-style library card-catalogue?) The logic of the indexing is much clearer, and the liberal provision of references to related headings allows specific searches to be undertaken, along with more general ones— e.g. 'English bookbindings XCI: binding perhaps by William Nott, c. 1680' is entered under Bookbindings, English and under Nott, William, and there is a reference to Nott from the heading Bookbinders. The only index comparable with BHI in specificity in this instance is ABHB , which enters under Bookbinding. Great Britain. XVIIth century, and provides a reference from Nott in the Geographical and Personal Names Index. ABHB , MLA and MHRA are all annuals, and all appear at least a year after the event, so that there is an argument for a current index to provide interim access to the literature of bibliography. The only current index which already indexes BC , Library , PBSA and SB is LL , but, as has been suggested above, it does not perform the task at all well; the basic problem is that LL is not really hospitable to bibliography. BHI is limited to British publications; but with the addition of Library it would provide good coverage of British bibliographical periodicals, even if embedded in an index which, despite its title, is more oriented to the social sciences. HI is not confined to American publications, and would be more hospitable to bibliography than LL : when it comes to convenience in indexing I assume that bibliography has greater affinities with literary research than with librarianship. At the very least SB ought to be transferred to HI from EGLI and LL . Of BI , which is published three times a year, little need be said: it is concerned with enumerative bibliography, and to be recorded a bibliography must contain fifty or more citations. Thus none of the frequent addenda to author bibliographies contained in PBSA for 1974 are included, nor, from BC part 4, such things as the check-lists of Harry Buxton Forman's Shelley reprints and of editions of Arthur Hugh Clough and Mrs. Cowley's The Belle's Stratagem . The only entries for 1974 from the four major bibliographical periodicals, both under the heading Bibliography, are for the SB Check List and the Library 'Recent books and periodicals'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII The discontinuation of the SB check lists has left ABHB as the only annual index which takes bibliography as its sole concern. Though SB was limited, in coverage and organization, it was at least predictable; ABHB is quite unpredictable, and is declining in performance. The best annual indexes are in fact MLA and MHRA , with the latter superior in all but speed of production. Of the current indexes IBZ can be dismissed completely. LL is unsatisfactory because of its limited coverage, its selectivity and its indexing under broad headings. BHI is limited by its British coverage, but offers the best indexing of any service. HI has deficiences, but would offer the greatest hospitality to bibliography. The only indexing at the level of bibliographical technique is done by Library in its annual index. The commonest indexing is either by broad subject or by author (i.e. of the literary etc. work). The more 'difficult' parts of the bibliographical periodicals are being indexed very rarely. The fixed-list indexes demonstrate the efficacy of such schemes in providing both complete coverage (within certain limits) and superior indexing. If indexing at the level of technique is desirable, a new fixed-list index of Anglo-American bibliographical periodicals will be called for, embracing the extant titles from at least Tanselle's categories 1 (Bibliographical Society Journals) and 2 (Book-Collecting Journals), supplemented by titles selected from 3 (Printing and Typographical Journals), 4 (Book-Trade and Paper-Trade Journals) and 5 (Library Journals).

      <field name="heading_text">The Concept of Ideal Copy by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whenever physical objects are produced in groups of supposedly identical exemplars, close scrutiny will inevitably disclose differences among them. Whether such differences are of any significance is a relative matter, depending on the degree of precision required for a given purpose. Some objects are made with such precision that elaborate equipment is required to detect differences, whereas other objects can serve their function well and be considered "identical" even if certain differences among them are easily visible to the naked eye. Copies of books that publishers present to the public as identical may actually vary from one another in a variety of ways, and a basic task of the analytical bibliographer is to determine what level of difference is of potential significance in a particular instance. Imperfections in the weave of the binding cloth or differences in the amount of inking of the type pages may prove to be insignificant, but the presence on some copies of a completely different cloth or the appearance in them of a difference in what is printed at a given point would deserve to be reported and analyzed by the bibliographer. A central truth that affects everything a bibliographer does is the fact that books are not meant to be unique items and are normally printed in runs of what purport to be duplicate copies. Manuscripts are by their nature unique, and anyone analyzing the physical details of a manuscript has only the one object to examine. 1 But anyone wishing to discuss the physical features of a particular edition or printing can never be content with a single copy, because one cannot know whether it corresponds with other copies. The totality of the evidence consists of all the copies; although one must frequently make generalizations without seeing every copy, such generalizations will be subject to revision as further copies are examined. In one way or another, all bibliographical analysis has to contend with the fact that a group may not be adequately represented by any one of its members. This point has of course long been recognized, at least since the time when the nineteenth-century incunabulists inaugurated the serious physical analysis of printed books. And it was repeatedly discussed just after the turn of the century by Pollard, Greg, and McKerrow in their pioneer work linking analytical bibliography and textual study. Pollard, for example, writing in 1907 on descriptive bibliography, recognized that one object of a description is to provide information that "may be used to ascertain whether other copies are complete and perfect." 2 At about the same time, he and Greg, in another basic article on descriptive bibliography, noted, "one of the first things that the bibliographical beginner learns is that the individuals which constitute an edition are frequently not identical," 3 and they went on to explain how various combinations of corrected and uncorrected formes can turn up in copies of Elizabethan books. Greg, in his Malone Society Reprints (1907-35), and McKerrow, in his edition of Nashe (1904-10), reported some of the differences among copies of individual editions, and McKerrow devoted a whole section to discussing this problem in his influential "Notes on Bibliographical Evidence" of 1913, 4 which was expanded as An Introduction to Bibliography (1927). Although the term ideal copy was not introduced into these discussions as a way of defining the object of a bibliographical description, it is clear that the distinction between a description of a single copy and a standard description of an edition, based on the examination of multiple copies, was well understood. As early as 1934 Greg spoke of the "ideally perfect copy," 5 and his work over the decades leading to the completion of his great Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939-59) shows his practice in describing "ideal" copies, even though it was not until 1959 that his introduction appeared with the formal statement that each of his descriptions represents "a standard or ideal copy" (IV, cxlviii). Meanwhile Fredson Bowers had brought these ideas to a focus in the first sustained analysis of the concept of ideal copy , in a 1947 article 6 and then in his Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949). In this as in other respects, Bowers's book clarified principles and procedures that had been evolving over the previous fifty years or more; the concept of ideal copy was not new, but he provided a workable formulation of it that has been standard ever since. That bibliographical descriptions must attempt to establish what the ideal copy in each case consists of would seem, at this late date, to be so widely accepted as to entail no further debate. And it would also seem to go without saying that the concept is equally crucial for the scholarly editor: if a descriptive bibliography of the work to be edited does not already exist, the editor must in effect produce one in order to be prepared for the job of editing. Yet, strangely, some bibliographies still appear that are based on the examination of only one or two copies of each item (in some cases following the erroneous assumption that more extensive investigation is unnecessary for twentieth-century books). And, similarly, some scholars still try to produce texts without engaging in much, if any, collation between copies of the same edition. The term ideal copy probably lends itself to misinterpretation, since it is not meant necessarily to imply a copy that is free from all error; but failure to comprehend the concept cannot be excused because of the infelicity of the term used to label it. Perhaps the most flagrant recent misunderstanding of the concept occurs in an article by Lorene Pouncey, who is misled by the word "ideal" into thinking that ideal copy represents an unattainable goal, which must continue to elude us as our conceptions of the ideal go on evolving; she reaches the extraordinary conclusion that ideal copy is "an absurd notion of analytical bibliographers . . . recognizable as part of the human 'habit of perfection.'" 7 Although the extent of her confusion is obviously not shared by the bibliographical world at large, there do seem to be some aspects of the concept that genuinely require clarification. What I shall say here should be regarded as a footnote to the basic discussion in Bowers's Principles (pp. 113-123, 404-406). But because Bowers treats the subject largely in the context of descriptive bibliography, there is some point in making more explicit its relevance to editing. Indeed, there is no better way of understanding the interdependence of descriptive bibliography and editing than by thinking about ideal copy . Whether we use that term is not important; but defining the concept and thinking through its implications are essential, because it goes to the heart of bibliographical scholarship. A renewed examination of this matter may also be opportune because of its bearing on the vexed question of the relation between library cataloguing and descriptive bibliography—a question that is now receiving considerable attention as a result of the work on the eighteenth-century short-title catalogue and the efforts to improve the standards for the machine-readable cataloguing of antiquarian books and special collections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The concept of ideal copy is central to descriptive bibliography, because it is the element that distinguishes bibliographical description from cataloguing: whereas a catalogue entry, regardless of its level of detail, exists to record a particular copy, a bibliographical description aims to provide a standard against which individual copies can be measured. 8 Thus the catalogue entry is tied to the physical features of a given copy, even if some of the features are actually post-publication imperfections of that copy. The bibliographical description, on the other hand, must be purged of such deficiencies of individual copies; it must be based on an examination of as much of the evidence as possible (that is, as many copies as possible), since there is no way to tell from the scrutiny of one or two or three copies how they compare to the edition as a whole without checking a considerably larger sample of that edition. Sometimes a thorough catalogue of a collection does make reference to additional copies outside the collection, but in doing so it is going beyond the function of a catalogue; and such a catalogue is particularly useful, for the very reason that a descriptive bibliography—being based on more evidence than a single collection can provide—has a broader usefulness than a catalogue. The bibliographical description rises above the limitations of a single copy by reporting what emerges as standard after an examination of multiple copies. This much is widely understood and indeed seems elementary. The difficulty arises in attempting to define more precisely the rationale for making decisions about what is abnormal or defective in a given copy and what is not. Some defects seem obvious, as when a leaf present in many copies is missing from another copy. But rarely are such matters as obvious as they may seem at first. Is it possible that the leaf was supposed to be canceled and that the presence of the leaf in some copies results from an oversight? Is it possible that the leaf was to be replaced with a cancel leaf, not present in the copies thus far examined? The answers to such questions can in some instances be deduced from the content of the text on this leaf and the adjacent leaves. But the principal evidence, of course, must come from still more copies. And if no other copies are extant, conclusive answers may not be possible. As is always the case with inductive investigation, what may seem clear at one stage may be shown to be incorrect when more instances are observed. Furthermore, when there are numerous differences among copies, no single surviving copy may be free of what the bibliographer concludes are deficiencies. Thus the ideal copy presented in the bibliographer's description may be an abstraction, for no such actual copy may be known to exist. The description is a historical reconstruction, based on the evidence of the extant copies; as such it is a hypothesis dependent on the bibliographer's judgment. But to say that raises more questions than it settles, questions that must be thought about if one is to understand what one is doing in setting up a bibliographical description. The best point of departure is the matter of intention, which the concept of ideal copy is generally thought to entail: deciding that certain copies are anomalous is equated with deciding that they do not conform to what the producer of the edition intended. Greg, defining the aim of the descriptions in his Bibliography , says, "what I have in view is not any particular copy of a book, which may have its own imperfections or abnormalities, but a standard or ideal copy as it was designed and intended by its producer" (IV, cxlviii). 9 If only an imperfect copy is known, he adds, "I give the register of such a book in the fullest form that can be inferred from the existing evidence, with due warning of course of its possibly hypothetical character." 10 That the goal is the intended form of the book is reinforced by his explanation that his collation formulas represent "issue-registers" (the arrangement of the leaves as published) rather than "printing-registers" (the arrangement as printed). He had been even more explicit in "A Formulary of Collation," where he equates "issue-formula" with the register of signatures defining "the make-up of the book . . . as it was meant to be issued" (p. 371). Thus when a printer uses the last leaf of the last gathering for the title, with the intention that the leaf will be placed first in the book as published, the bibliographer is to record the leaf in its intended place. 11 (Of course, for books that were sold in sheets and later bound to individual order, "binding-register" would sometimes be a more appropriate term than "issue-register.") Even if all copies examined by the bibliographer retain the leaf in its original position at the end, Greg was saying, the description would still place it at the beginning, for that is clearly its intended location, and the copies examined happen to have been anomalies. 12 Bowers, in the standard definition of ideal copy , similarly makes the printer's intention the determining factor: an ideal copy is a book which is complete in all its leaves as it ultimately left the printer's shop in perfect condition and in the complete state that he considered to represent the final and most perfect state of the book. ( Principles , p. 113) 13 In the elaboration of the definition that follows, the producer's intention is again cited: An ideal copy contains not only all the blank leaves intended to be issued as integral parts of its gatherings but also all excisions and all cancellans leaves or insertions which represent the most perfect state of the book as the printer or publisher finally intended to issue it in the issue described. The emphasis here is on the physical form of the book, on the order and completeness of the leaves 14 and not of their content. As Bowers points out, ideal copy does not imply "freedom from textual errors, misprints, variant uncorrected formes" and does not refer to "the quality of the text in any way as a criticism of the printer's final result." Nevertheless, textual considerations are not entirely irrelevant. A textual correction that results in a cancel leaf of course affects the physical structure of the book; but textual differences may exist that are not locatable through an alteration of the structure of the gatherings. Stop-press corrections may produce (and during the first two and a half centuries of printing routinely did produce) sheets containing various combinations of corrected and uncorrected formes, and books may be made up of various combinations of such sheets; no physical anomaly would call attention to the differences in text, which would be discoverable only through textual collation. Yet corrections or revisions of this kind are also encompassed in the concept of ideal copy . According to Bowers, while " ideal copy in its true sense of physical makeup is not affected," one would nevertheless "certainly choose the details of the corrected form to transcribe or note in one's description as the 'ideal' form, listing the other as a variant" (p. 114); the standards for ideal copy apply not only to the collation formula but also to the contents paragraph, "which should contain the contents in their most perfect state," including the correct form of variant catchwords, and the like. What Bowers is saying, in other words, is that the correctness of the text is an aspect of ideal copy to the extent that corrections were actually made within a given issue; 15 but errors that were not corrected do not prevent copies containing them from being ideal copies. A principal difficulty in defining ideal copy therefore has to do with intention, for it is unreasonable to think that a printer's or publisher's intention is to produce errors, and yet the presence of errors—not corrected at any stage in the production of an issue of a book—is compatible with the concept of ideal copy . An analogy with editing—where another kind of intention figures—is instructive. Bowers, like Greg, points out that ideal copy may be "a purely hypothetical reconstruction" (p. 117). 16 One might therefore see a similarity between the descriptive bibliographer's usual concept of an ideal copy—a copy more nearly resembling the publisher's intention than any single extant copy may happen to do—and the scholarly editor's concept of a critical text—a text more accurately reflecting the author's intentions than any single extant text may happen to do. There is an important difference, however. The critical editor's aim is to rectify errors in a text, whether or not they have ever been corrected in any previous edition; the editor's material is texts, which are arrangements of words and punctuation that happen to be given concrete embodiments in the form of printed editions. But the descriptive bibliographer's goal is to report the historical facts about an edition and not to perfect it or alter it beyond the latest point reached by those responsible for producing it; the bibliographer's material is the concrete embodiment of texts, not the texts themselves. Thus if all copies of an edition contain an obvious textual error, that error is a part of the ideal copy; but if some copies do not contain the error—either because a stop-press alteration rectified it during the course of printing or because the leaf or sheet containing the error was canceled and replaced with a corrected substitute after printing was completed—the description of the ideal copy would have to indicate the fact that the correction had taken place. The critical editor, on the other hand, is not limited by the fact that an error has not been corrected in documentary form, if its status as an error can be otherwise established. Both the bibliographer and the editor produce historical reconstructions; but the subject of the bibliographer's attention is a physical object, whereas the focus of the critical editor's attention is an abstraction. Critical editors must take the physical evidence into account, but it is of concern to them for what it reveals about the authority of particular readings, not for its own sake. 17 One can see, therefore, that the introduction of the idea of intention into the definition of ideal copy is not without its difficulties. How it came about is easy enough to understand: when a leaf is missing, or a plate is inserted at the wrong point, or a canceled leaf remains alongside the cancel, the natural reaction is to say that these results were not intended—and that they are thus characteristics of aberrant or defective copies. But the recognition that something is unintended clearly provides no basis for saying that the intended form also exists (or once existed). If a given page in one copy of a book contains an obviously garbled text, one would not be inclined to jump to the conclusion that a corrected text exists in other copies, and one might even say that the matter is totally irrelevant to the determination of the ideal copy. But if another copy is located with the garbled text rectified by means of cancellation, ideal copy is certainly affected, because the description of the ideal copy would have to make reference to the cancel. Furthermore, it is difficult to see how the situation would be any different if the correction had been made during the press run, though there would then be no cancel to draw one's attention to the textual alteration. In either case there is a physical difference among copies of a single issue: in one, the difference is of inked type-impressions only; in the other, it is that plus a change in the physical structure of a gathering. To make only one of these situations a factor in the determination of ideal copy, and the other one not, would be to insist on an artificial distinction and thus to trivialize the concept of ideal copy . As Bowers's discussion recognizes, stop-press alterations do affect ideal copy ; defining "ideal" so as not to imply freedom from textual error does not mean that textual matters are to be ignored. If a printer corrects one error—either during the press run or by cancel—but in the process overlooks another on the same page, that remaining error is of course a part of the ideal copy; but where the alteration is in fact made, the altered form must be taken into account in thinking about the characteristics of the ideal copy. It is true that textual correctness is not relevant to ideal copy; but when textual differences actually exist between copies of an issue, determining which readings were the replacements (whether or not they were "corrections") is a necessary activity in describing the ideal copy for that issue. Authorial intention is beside the point; the question is not whether the printer's alteration brought the text into greater conformity with what the author intended but simply the determination of which reading the printer intended as the replacement. Intention is involved in ideal copy , then, only to the extent that alternatives to choose among exist in physical form in the issue as a whole. Which of two forms a printer intended as a replacement for the other is the bibliographer's business to ponder; but when only a single form was produced, the question of intention does not come up, even though some of the features of that form are not in fact what the printer intended. If some of the differences among copies were created by the activity of individual owners or were caused in some other way after the time when the copies involved had left the hands of their producer, one could say that such differences were not intended by the producer. It could well happen, however, that some of these differences might actually be a fulfillment of the producer's intentions. Obviously if a leaf is lost from a book through rough treatment over the years, this loss is not a cancellation intended by the printer; but if some owner has a misplaced leaf moved to its correct location, this action carries out what the printer intended. Yet it is equally irrelevant to the bibliographer's concerns, for it is not a part of the production history of the book. Intention of the printer or publisher is therefore not really the most satisfactory way of approaching the question of ideal copy . The crucial point—at least the first crucial point—is to distinguish those differences among copies attributable to the producer of the book from those not so attributable. The fundamental purpose of establishing such a concept as ideal copy , after all, is to segregate characteristics of a book that occurred during its production from those that occurred at some later time. There are further considerations that the concept leads to, but its basic function is to enable one to identify which features of a given copy of a book were present when the book was released or put on sale and which ones originated after that point. The intention of the printer or publisher of a book has nothing to do with the matter: unintended features may be present in copies as they are released, and intended features may be brought about later. 18 But the bibliographer, as a historian of the production of the book, must be interested in the former and is not concerned with the latter. 19 What the bibliographer must decide, to put it another way, is which differences among copies constitute states and which result from the history of individual copies following their release from the publisher or printer. 20 In bibliographical terminology, a state refers to any part of a copy of a book that differs, at the time of such release, from the corresponding part of other copies, within the same issue or impression, as a result of an error or the correction of an error, or for any other reason that causes the publisher not to call attention to the difference as a discrete publishing effort. 21 A state is one of the forms of a sheet or a casing available to a purchaser at the time of the release of individual copies; but it is by no means necessarily an intended form. States do often, it is true, originate in a printer's or a publisher's effort to correct an error discovered in previously printed, but not yet released, copies, and such corrected states are indeed intentional. But states can equally well derive from errors that occur during the process of production, making the later states less correct than the earlier. An omitted or a duplicated gathering, or a page with severe type damage along one margin, is clearly not an intended feature of a book; but a copy that reached the market in this condition could not be dismissed by the bibliographer, because this feature is a part of the production history of the copy. The number of copies involved cannot be the test, any more than intention can. Even if only one copy lacks a given gathering when put on sale, or shows type damage, that is still one of the states in which the book emerged from production; and if twenty copies of a book have by coincidence had identical leaves removed from them after their release, that curious situation has nothing to do with the production of the book, and those copies would not represent a state. Of course, the evidence of a single copy (or a very small number) is often difficult to interpret, and one might conclude on such evidence that a particular feature was not present when the copy was released, and yet might conclude differently if more copies exhibiting this feature were located; if, however, the nature of the evidence allows one to know, even from a single copy, that a feature was indeed present at the time the copy was released, one must take it into account somehow, even if one wishes to stress its insignificance. 22 The point is that the number of copies exhibiting a particular feature cannot by itself determine whether that feature qualifies for inclusion in a standard description. The primary decision for the bibliographer, therefore, is whether or not a given feature of a book is a product of its printing and publishing history. The decision is not a simple one: because intention and statistics are not determining factors, an obviously unintended feature observed in a single copy cannot automatically be ruled out as not constituting a state. The concept of the ideal copy of an issue—though the term is usually expressed in the singular—must accommodate all the states of the issue. A single copy cannot be expected to contain all states, of course, but all the states must be a part of the description of an issue. The notion that a description of an ideal copy must be set up as a description of a single copy no doubt results from what is perceived as the practical necessity of choosing certain features—a particular title page, collation formula, list of contents, and so forth—for primary representation in the description. The only real necessity, however, when two versions of the same thing exist, is to describe one first, and there is no reason why the one presented first need be thought of as "primary" in any qualitative sense. In fact, the historical purpose of the description is best served by reporting—for any given feature that exists in two states—the first state first, followed by the second. 23 It is true that in some cases this arrangement would mean that the less correct state would be reported first—but not always, for a first state is not always less "correct" than a second, since a state can result from accident as well as intention. And in any event, the presence of a less correct state of a given sheet in a copy of a book does not make that copy any less "ideal," because the copy still represents one of the forms in which the book was offered to the public. A state by definition relates only to one part of a book, such as a sheet, and not to a book as a whole; when several sheets are produced in variant states, it is possible for a particular copy of a book to have earlier states of some sheets and later states of others. Thus the description of variant states must be a part of a description of an issue or impression, and the "ideal" being described encompasses certain sets of alternatives. Although alterations to title pages often produce new issues because they identify a discrete publishing effort, some variations in title pages may produce only states; in such cases a description would have to provide two title-page descriptions, one labeled "first state" and one "second state." When variant states affect the collation formula or the contents paragraph, alternative accounts of the affected element can be reported; or when stop-press alterations result in variant formes, the various possibilities can be outlined. The important point to recognize is that the standard description, or ideal copy , of an issue must allow for the variations identified as states. 24 A different issue will be represented by a different ideal copy; but for any given issue, ideal copy is likely to embrace a set of alternatives. 25 The most difficult problem, therefore, is not the mechanical one of setting up a description so as to accommodate different states but the prior question of how to decide which variations are in fact states and which are alterations resulting from the vicissitudes that a copy has endured after the time of its release. The latter must of course be recorded in the section of the description identifying the individual copies examined; that section constitutes the primary documentation on which the description is based, and peculiarities of particular copies must be mentioned there, so that readers can know what evidence the bibliographer surveyed. But the variations that can be classified as states—those occurring during the process of production—become part of the body of the description itself. Indeed, the purpose of the concept of ideal copy is to cause the bibliographer to think about this distinction; to put the matter concisely, ideal copy is concerned with those differences within an issue that can be regarded as states . It follows, to repeat two points not widely understood, that textual differences are to be included among the physical variations with which ideal copy is concerned; and that the producer's intention is relevant only when variations actually existed among the copies as they were issued, and then only to the extent that it may be of use in thinking about the order of those variations. All these points inevitably lead to the central question: how one can possess the requisite physical evidence for knowing whether differences exist among copies of an issue, and then for deciding which of them occurred during the production of those copies and which occurred at later times in their histories. Naturally, one begins by looking at numerous copies, when they exist. Even though the number of copies exhibiting a given characteristic is not necessarily a criterion for classifying it as a state, one can in fact frequently decide that a certain characteristic appears too many times to be attributed to the independent action of individual owners. And of course, the inspection of multiple copies is necessary simply to locate what the points of variation are. But the process raises difficult questions. How can one know when all variations have been discovered? How many copies constitute a sufficient sample? May it not happen that all surviving copies, even when there are many of them, do not form a large enough proportion of the total edition to serve as a reliable sample? If it is not feasible to see every copy of an issue (and generally it is not, either because they do not all survive or because the issue was too large to make tracking them all down a practicable undertaking), can the attempt to generalize about the issue as a whole be justified? 26 The first answer is to say that these questions can be asked about any inductive investigation; that, as one becomes expert through the process of investigation, one is in a position to make an informed judgment about the extent of the evidence required or the sufficiency of the obtainable evidence; and that careful generalization, based on cautious and responsible use of the located evidence, is valuable, even if it is later shown to be erroneous in certain respects. These points do of course apply to bibliographical research; but because descriptive bibliography is not always recognized as the branch of historical scholarship that it is, some further comment on these questions may help to clarify the nature of bibliographical descriptions. Suppose, for instance, that one has examined four copies of a book, all of which have a dedication leaf at the end of the last gathering, presumably intended to be cut out and inserted among the other preliminaries in the first gathering. Does the seeming obviousness of the intention justify constructing a collation formula for the ideal copy indicating the insertion of this leaf into the first gathering? How could one be certain where in the gathering to indicate its insertion? If the leaf bore a special signature or a page number or some other guide to its intended location, would the case for placing it in the preliminaries be strengthened? If one looked at twenty-five, or fifty, copies of the book and still found all to have the dedication leaf at the end, would the question be affected? Would one's thinking about the matter be different depending on whether the book was issued in a publisher's casing or whether it was from an earlier period and was bound according to the wishes of individual owners? These questions illustrate why one has to consider whether the purposes of bibliographical description ever require that a printer's or publisher's intention take precedence over the historical fact of what actually happened. If (for the sake of argument) this hypothetical book was from the period of publisher's binding and if the entire issue was bound with the dedication leaf at the end, the bibliographer would have no justification for altering its position in describing the ideal copy, even if in fact this position was not the intended one. If the book was from the period before publisher's binding (or from a later period but issued in sheets), one might more relevantly raise the question of intention, because the producer of the sheets would not necessarily have had control over the binding of any copies. Even so, if all copies were bound with the dedication leaf at the end, there would be little reason for presenting a standard description that differed from them—unless clear evidence existed to show that all the binders had disregarded the printer's binding specifications. In practice, of course, one can scarcely ever be in this omniscient position with regard to the issue as a whole. But the value of thinking about an extreme situation is that it may make clearer the framework within which more realistic situations need to be viewed. A standard description of a book is a historical generalization, rising above the idiosyncrasies of individual copies but resisting the temptation to substitute what should have been for what was. Perhaps there would be less need to make this point if "ideal" had not been the adjective in the generally accepted term. In actual situations, much of the difficulty in distinguishing what the producer was responsible for from what later owners were responsible for arises from the fact that one does not have access to all the evidence. Even if one examines all surviving copies of a book, the portion of the original issue that one has not seen may still be sizable; making generalizations about the issue as a whole can therefore be an uncertain business. Acts of historical reconstruction must very often be based on something less than the full evidence and are thus dependent on the judgment of the historian in weighing such evidence as there is. Different historians may of course come to different conclusions, and more than one account may legitimately exist at the same time. Descriptive bibliographers must make numerous decisions in the process of interpreting the evidence of individual copies and constructing from it a generalized account. There are a great many variables that they must consider, such as the printing, binding, and publishing customs of the period, any external evidence bearing on the situation, and the number and nature of the surviving copies. So much inevitably depends on the learning and judgment of the bibliographer that it would be futile to attempt to set up detailed rules regarding ideal copy . What is important, instead, is to have a clear idea of the rationale that should underlie specific decisions. Surely such a rationale must start from the premise that, while the production of a standard description is a creative activity, none of the points that go into it can be invented. Everything else follows from that. If a leaf is obviously missing, or an obvious typographical error is present, in all examined (or known) copies, one cannot invent a corrected state. But if tangible evidence exists, one may then be legitimately faced with alternatives. It is then that one begins to weigh the various characteristics of the specific instance—the printing practice of the time, the number of copies seen, and so on. If a dedication leaf consistently appears at the end of the known copies of a book, one may still decide to note it in the description at the conventional location, if one has reason to believe that all the known copies are idiosyncratic—if few exist, for example, and if they were bound by individual owners. Under different circumstances, one might decide that the standard description should show the leaf in its position at the end—if, for example, a great many copies, all in publisher's binding, have been seen. In neither case is one inventing evidence: the dedication leaf exists. And in the first case one is not falsifying the evidence, for a standard description does not purport to be identical with any given copy; by noting the dedication leaf at its conventional place, one is expressing an informed and reasoned opinion that the evidence supports the choice of this position as the place where the dedication leaf would have appeared if the printer had had control over the binding. Printer's intention thus can play a role for books not issued in a binding or casing, but only when compelling evidence exists that the order of the leaves as bound is not the printer's intended order. Even so, it is important to have the description show the order as printed as well as the intended order of issue. And in other respects the printer's intention is irrelevant, for intention does not necessarily coincide with performance. Projecting what was true for the issue as a whole is not the same as projecting what was intended; both activities are of interest, but the bibliographer must keep the distinction clear and understand which governs the description of a so-called "ideal" copy. (In making this distinction one must remember, in other words, that leaves intentionally printed at one point for insertion at a different point constitute a special case: in books issued unbound their presence at the original location at the time of issue is not an error, as it would be in books issued in publisher's casing, and thus a bibliographer's decision to record both the proper position as well as the original position of such leaves is not an instance of correcting an error but simply a way of clarifying the nature of the issue.) There are times, of course, when intention and actuality coincide; but if bibliographers are to have a firm understanding of what they are about, they must be prepared to deal with situations where the two do not coincide. All decisions regarding ideal copy must be reasoned ones; none can be automatic or mechanical. Less misunderstanding about ideal copy would probably have arisen if the status of descriptive bibliography as history had been better understood. Once one leaves the security of describing individual copies and attempts to produce a standard description that will accommodate not only all examined copies but those not examined as well, one is engaging in the creative scholarship of historical interpretation. Responsible historical accounts do not depart from the facts, but they are more than assemblages of discrete facts; they bring the facts together in such a way as to reveal a meaning or order in them—not the meaning and order, because the facts may well, and probably will, support other interpretations. Such an account is thus necessarily hypothetical, but for all its lack of certainty it marks an important advance in understanding; even several conflicting (but responsible) accounts are more informative than the undigested facts. A description of a standard or ideal copy of a book, in other words, is "truer" than the description of any one copy, even though it rests to a greater degree on subjective judgment. Good descriptive bibliographies are normally more useful than catalogues because they are based on a qualified individual's reasoned assessment of the evidence relating to the edition or issue as an entity. When one focuses on the fact that a bibliographical description is a piece of historical scholarship, one can readily see that the standard copy or copies it describes cannot necessarily be equated with a copy that fulfills its producer's—much less its author's—intentions. A standard description reports the "ideal" only in the sense that it records the features (or variations in them) thought to characterize individual copies as they emerged from the printer or publisher. Any other construction of the word, or of the concept of ideal copy , would conflict with the historical aims that "description" suggests and would confuse rather than clarify the orderly delineation of past events.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Ideal copy , as this account of it is intended to make clear, cannot be divorced from textual considerations. The fact that descriptive bibliography is concerned with physical details has caused some misunderstanding on this point and has led some people to think that ideal copy is unrelated to textual matters and therefore to editing. Ideal copy does, of course, refer to physical features of a book, but the inked type-impressions that transmit the text are physical features, and textual differences among copies are physical differences. Textual correctness is obviously something else, and descriptive bibliography is not concerned with it; but textual differences among copies cannot be ignored in descriptive bibliography, or in the concept of ideal copy . The idea that analytical bibliography—which underlies both descriptive bibliography and editing—does not require a knowledge of the meaning of the texts printed in the books under analysis has frequently been held in exaggerated form, largely as the result of some overstatements on Greg's part (made in the course of trying to explain the aims of what was then a relatively new field). 27 It is true, of course, that the analytical bibliographer is not concerned with the meaning of texts in the way that an editor is; but a knowledge of the language of the texts is always helpful to an analytical bibliographer, and sometimes essential (as in recognizing variant spellings in compositor analysis). Analytical and descriptive bibliographers would often leave their work undone if they did not take note of textual differences in their accounts of physical differences among copies. The relation of the textual interests of descriptive bibliographers and those of editors can be somewhat clarified by considering the use that editors of both critical and noncritical editions might make of bibliographical descriptions. Noncritical editions provide the more obvious starting point, because a noncritical edition is one that aims to reproduce exactly a particular manuscript or printed text—without, that is, calling upon the editor's critical judgment to provide emendations. For a noncritical edition of a manuscript, there is no question about what copy to follow, since a manuscript is unique; there may of course be a question about which of the various manuscripts of a given work is to be reproduced, but once a particular manuscript is settled upon as worthy of reproduction, there is no further choice to be made among copies. But with printed material the situation is different. Even after one has decided which edition—or impression or issue—of a work is the one to be reproduced, one still must face the problem of which copy should be used, since one obviously cannot assume—for books of any period—that all copies are the same. Whether the noncritical edition is to be a photographic reproduction or a new setting of type, it will contain that form of the text present in the copy selected, since no emendations are to be made, and the copy should therefore be chosen carefully. Of course, the copy used must be specified in the noncritical edition, and some editors may argue that the choice of copy is not crucial, so long as readers know exactly where they stand—so long as they are told that the noncritical edition follows the text of a particular copy and that it is thus limited to the documentary evidence present in that copy. But surely in most cases it would be foolish to reproduce a copy that had been altered over the years if another copy existed that was closer to the form (or one of the forms) in which the book originally appeared. Comparison of extant copies, then, is a necessity even for editors of noncritical editions, so that they will be in a position to determine what features of particular copies have resulted from alteration occurring since the time of the publisher's release of those copies. In addition, they may find that copies of a given issue differ among themselves in containing variant states of the text, and they have the problem of choosing—even among copies that have not been altered by individual owners—the copy that is most desirable from a textual point of view. Some editors of noncritical editions have long recognized the usefulness of pointing out textual differences between the copy reproduced and other copies. Even when an editor feels that it is not feasible to provide a full list of variants, some statement is called for—beyond the identification of the particular copy—generalizing about the issue as a whole and what relation the reproduced copy bears to it. Just because editors of noncritical editions do not have to make critical choices among individual variant readings does not absolve them of the responsibility for knowing what variants exist within the edition they are concerned with; choosing a copy for reproduction is itself a critical choice, and it should be as informed a choice as possible. When a descriptive bibliography has sorted out the various states comprising the ideal copy (or, it might be better to say, the ideal copies) of an issue, the editor of a noncritical edition can use this information with great profit. But when that bibliographical work has not been performed, the responsible editor of a noncritical edition has no alternative but to undertake the task. Editing, even of noncritical editions, cannot be divorced from descriptive bibliography and from the concept of ideal copy . Charlton Hinman's Norton Facsimile (1968) of the Shakespeare First Folio provides the natural focus for a discussion of this point. The Folger collection of eighty copies of the Folio made feasible Hinman's detailed study of the printing of the volume 28 and put him in possession of a thorough knowledge of the various mixtures of corrected and uncorrected formes present in different copies. Because each of the copies contains a mixture of earlier and later states of the text of those pages known to exist in variant states, a photographic reproduction of any one copy—though it would be useful in showing one of the forms in which the book appeared—would be limited to the chance combination of sheets present in that copy. What Hinman conceived was the idea of photographing the latest state of the text of each page, from whatever copies these states were found in, and bringing these photographs together; the resulting facsimile is not a facsimile of any extant copy but a collection of facsimiles of individual pages. In the end Hinman found it necessary to utilize thirty copies as the sources for photographs, and he carefully records the copy used for each page. The Norton Facsimile is a noncritical edition because Hinman does not introduce editorial emendations into the text as it appears in the Folio; but because there is no such thing as the text of the Folio, he has clearly exercised his informed editorial judgment in deciding which of the Folio texts of each page is to appear in his facsimile. This approach is the logical result of a search for the most appropriate copy to reproduce. Whether or not the result should be thought of as representing the ideal copy is a question that has engendered some disagreement. Hinman himself, after describing the basis for his choice of pages, calls it the first facsimile that undertakes to reproduce "such an 'ideal' copy of the First Folio" (p. xxiv). Those who object to this application of the term are apparently under the misapprehension that the concept of ideal copy has nothing to do with textual variants. Actually, the basis for possible criticism of the statement lies elsewhere. In the first place, if this collection of pages were claimed to be the ideal copy, one could object that the book appeared with various combinations of sheets and that the bibliographical concept of ideal copy must accommodate the divergent forms that in fact appeared; this combination of pages might indeed be an ideal copy, or one of the forms of ideal copy, but cannot be the ideal copy. Second, whether it is an ideal copy depends on whether it would have been a physically possible form for the printer to have issued. Obviously in preparing a facsimile text one cannot pick and choose among readings on the same page, combining a reading from one copy of the page with a reading found only in a different copy at another point on the page, if there is no evidence that these two readings ever existed simultaneously on the same page. But as long as it was physically possible for sheets printed with first formes in the latest state of alteration to be perfected with second formes in the latest state and for successive sheets in such a state to be assembled into individual copies of the completed book, one can legitimately posit that combination of "corrected" formes as falling within the range of copies encompassed by ideal copy . The fact that such a copy does not actually exist is not in itself a deterrent to the classification, since the extant copies are a random assemblage, and the combinations of sheets in them are also produced by chance. But the degree of likelihood that such a copy ever existed, if one is in a position to weigh that likelihood, may indeed be a deterrent. If one had been able to see every copy as issued, and none contained all the corrected formes, one could not think of such a copy as an ideal copy, even though it was technically possible, for ideal copy is a historical concept applicable to the copies of a book as issued. But when one has access to less than the full evidence, what is possible becomes less easy to rule out. In any case, the question whether the Norton Facsimile can be considered to represent an ideal copy is of more use as an exercise in thinking about the implications of the concept than for any practical purpose it might serve. A thorough bibliographical description, after all, would record the various states of each forme (and, in the documentation, the combinations present in examined copies), but it would not endorse particular combinations of those states, except where there is evidence that certain states are linked together. And Hinman's facsimile—though it may indeed, as he claims, be a "reproduction of what the printers of the original edition would themselves have considered an ideal copy" (p. xxii)—need not be labeled an "ideal copy" except to the extent that it presents one of the possibilities that ideal copy for this book apparently embraces. What it does, to be more precise, is to single out from the various forms in which the book appeared or conceivably appeared the one that makes most sense, in Hinman's view, to reproduce for purposes of textual study. The historical question of whether a copy could have appeared, or did appear, in this form is of less moment for such purposes than the value for reference of having this particular assemblage of material. One should not forget, however, that editors and other students of the text cannot limit themselves to "corrected" formes, which are often less correct—at least as far as accidentals are concerned—than "uncorrected" formes. 29 They must be fully apprised of all variant states of the text and must therefore consult, or prepare for themselves, the information that a bibliographical description provides. What Hinman did with photographs, some collectors have done with originals: to insert material from one copy into another copy. Of course, Hinman could move single pages, whereas those who are recombining originals cannot move less than a single leaf (containing a type page from an inner and from an outer forme). The practice of "making up" copies by inserting leaves to replace those that are missing has been variously discussed, and with considerable feeling. One prominent instance concerns the Scheide copy of the Gutenberg Bible, in which several missing leaves were replaced after it came into the Scheide collection. Writing about this copy in The Scheide Library (1947), Julian Boyd says that there are two schools of thought on the matter. Some would hold that the copy should have remained in exactly the form in which it was received; others, he believes, would take the point of view that there was no imprescriptible and inviolable order in which the leaves of a given book were assembled by the printer and book-binder. Indeed, with the aid of simple equations involving the law of chance, they could prove mathematically the virtual impossibility that a given book would be made up throughout of printed sheets always in the same order of impression that they came from the press. If a printer, or more particularly, if a book-binder could substitute a new leaf for one that had been damaged or torn or was missing at the time the book passed through his hands on the way to posterity and if he could have his right to "alteration of the condition" of the book accepted unquestioningly by all, why could not a collector do the same? At what point, that is, did trusteeship begin in the history of a book? . . . What did the invention of printing from movable types mean if not the interchangeability of one leaf for another, excepting only the unique illuminations which did not properly belong to printing at all but were a carry-over from the copyist's art? (pp. 85-86) This passage, apparently meant to defend the practice of making-up, does not give it as good a defense as might be constructed and in the process exhibits a number of confusions—confusions that a careful consideration of the concept of ideal copy would have set straight. It is true of course that a great many variables determine the particular combination of sheets brought together for each copy of a book and that individual copies cannot be expected to consist throughout of sheets that were first off the press, or second off the press, or third off the press, and so on. (In any case, the order "off the press" can refer only to the printing of second formes; the order in which the white paper was printed is likely to be very different from the order of perfecting.) But this fact cannot be taken to suggest that all mixing of sheets has the same status regardless of the point in the history of a copy when it takes place. The point where the "trusteeship" of a copy begins, to put the question in those terms, is the moment when the copy is released from the control of its producer. Even though the sheets of that copy may be mixed (or even deficient), the combination and arrangement of sheets present in it are evidence of one form in which the book emerged from the process of its production; any physical alteration made in the copy after that point, even if it brings the copy nearer to the form intended by the printer, violates the integrity of the historical evidence. To say that the "alteration of the condition" of a book by binders is accepted "unquestioningly" is to confuse the issue in several ways. First of all, it is one thing for a binder, in the process of binding a book that was not published in an edition casing, to rearrange certain leaves within a copy, as specifically called for by the printer (e.g., moving a half-title from the end to the beginning). It is quite another for that binder to undertake to remedy what are presumed to be defects in the copy by inserting leaves that were not originally part of the copy. If binders have often thought of this latter procedure as a routine part of their business, and if their clients have sometimes accepted the practice "unquestioningly," these attitudes do not justify the practice or provide grounds for later owners to continue it. Making up copies, whether by early binders or by later collectors, remains a tampering with the evidence. Furthermore, the situation is not simply one of continuing to mix sheets in the way that they were originally mixed; what is inserted later is hardly ever a sheet (a whole piece of paper as folded according to the format) but a leaf , thus mixing together a leaf from one sheet with the remaining leaf or leaves from another sheet. Students of the text naturally need to ascertain the order of any stop-press alterations and must therefore work out just what was on the press at any one time; but one can never know whether the text of inserted leaves is identical to that of the missing leaves, and inserted leaves obviously cannot stand as satisfactory substitutes for the originals. Of course, one should normally be able to tell that such leaves are disjunct, and one would then look at them with particular skepticism; but still one needs to know whether they are true cancels or later insertions, both for textual purposes and as a general matter of understanding the nature of the preserved evidence. Finally, there is the point about the "interchangeability" of leaves printed from movable type. The invention of movable type clearly has nothing to do with the matter, since other ways of preparing printing surfaces (such as that used for block books) were also intended to result in identical copies. The important point, however, is that the intention to produce identical copies cannot be accepted by the historian as equivalent to the deed; one cannot assume that all copies of a leaf were in fact identical and that missing evidence can simply be replaced by its supposed duplicate. For all these reasons bibliographers and editors always try to be alert to the possibility of alterations made during the process of binding or other alterations made by individual owners. Books not issued in publishers' bindings or casings, as well as rebound or recased copies of those so issued, must always be examined with unusual severity; and in some cases one remains so unsatisfied as to rule such copies out completely as sources of evidence. Certainly one should have no faith in rebound copies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books if copies in publishers' casings are plentiful (though one should still examine them on the chance that they might contain otherwise unknown textual variants). There is no way of rationalizing the making up of copies to give them the same status as books that have not been tampered with. A much better, and far simpler, defense of the Scheide Bible would have been to say that, since certain leaves were missing from it, no further damage was being done to the copy by replacing those leaves, so long as the known facts about each inserted leaf were clearly indicated in order to prevent any misinterpretation of the evidence. This may not be a very strong defense, but at least it says that the insertion of leaves, if done properly, causes no serious harm, even if it provides no great benefits, either. In making such a point, one of course assumes that the leaves used for replacement are already disjunct and that another copy of the book, however imperfect, is not being destroyed to provide a supply of leaves. The loss of evidence that may result from dismembering even an imperfect copy is not offset by any important gain when leaves from it are made to serve a cosmetic function in another copy. John Carter, discussing made-up copies in his ABC for Book Collectors (5th ed., corr., 1974), warns his readers against copies containing leaves from wholly different editions (resulting, he says, from "faking-up"). But whereas such "bibliographical felony," as he describes it, is naïve and easily detectable, the subtler activity of inserting leaves from the same edition is no less a felony and is equally productive of fakes. The argument made for the Scheide Bible is by no means unique, but it provides a convenient occasion for showing why editors of noncritical editions must be concerned with the concept of ideal copy and why their work and that of descriptive bibliographers are inseparable. What is true of editors of noncritical editions is also true of editors of critical editions; and it is worth considering briefly why this is so, since one might at first think that establishing the forms of ideal copy would be less important to the critical editor, whose aim is not to produce a facsimile or an exact rendering of a single documentary text. The goal of the critical editor is to construct a text that conforms as closely as possible with some particular standard—normally, in scholarly editing, the author's intention. It may be that none of the documentary texts meets this standard, and the critical text constructed by the editor may be different from any that has gone before. Critical editors are not limited, in other words, to readings that have appeared in print in a given edition; 30 they may combine readings from different editions and make corrections on their own authority (corrections that had not previously been made in any edition), so long as in their informed judgment the available evidence justifies such emendations as bringing a text more into line with its author's intention. In order to be in a position to use this editorial freedom responsibly, they must have a thorough knowledge of all relevant evidence, the primary part of which is the physical evidence. 31 Even when they are certain that a particular reading requires to be corrected in a given way, their thinking must still be grounded on the firm base of knowing all the readings that have appeared at that point in authorized editions. If they do not make a search among copies of the same impression or issue—with or without the benefit of a descriptive bibliography—they will not know whether the correction they are proposing was in fact already present in one state of one of the sheets of the book. The difference between the descriptive bibliographer and the critical editor can be illustrated by a situation in which a printer makes a stop-press correction but through a mischance simultaneously creates an error in the following line. The editor will choose the two correct readings, one from each state; the bibliographer will record the two states as alternative forms for ideal copy but cannot contemplate the two correct readings together, since there is no physical evidence that the two ever existed together on the same page. Despite their differences in the use of the information, both editor and bibliographer must make the same search for evidence: both must in effect define ideal copy , because both must be aware of all states of an issue. That states result from inadvertent as well as intended alterations and that later states are not always more correct than earlier ones is demonstrated over and over in editorial work. For example, progressive deterioration of type or variations in inking during the course of an impression may create what appear to be textual errors in books of all periods. Many editors of The Tempest have printed one line as "So rare a wondred Father, and a wise," believing—even after checking a number of copies of the Folio—that the last word is indeed "wise" (printed of course with a long s ). Jeanne Addison Roberts, however, after examining many more copies of the Folio, has discovered that the word originally read "wife" and that the crossbar of the f shows various stages of progressive damage in most copies, making it look like a long s . 32 The lesson for editors is clear. Similarly, there are many instances in the original printings of Melville's work where letters or marks of punctuation failed to print; the spaces for them are present, but nothing appears in the spaces in any copies thus far examined. In "The Piazza," no punctuation follows the phrase "this weariness and wakefulness together," and the following word, "Brother," appears to start a new sentence; presumably a period is missing, though conceivably the mark was an exclamation point (the passage is in direct discourse). In Moby-Dick there is an unusually large space following the word "almanack" at the end of the first clause of a sentence in Chapter 99; an editor will probably insert a semicolon there because the English edition (set from proofs of the American) has a semicolon. But a comma would also be appropriate, and there is no way of knowing what mark the compositor set unless a copy turns up with the mark printed. Even when there is no question what is missing—as when, in Mardi , the phrase "crossing his wooden eg" appears—the editor who has located no copy containing the missing letter will have to list the correct form as an emendation. In the English edition of White-Jacket the word "very" in the phrase "very industriously" (in Chapter 54) is not present, though there is a space for it. Since the American edition is the copy-text, an editor does not of course need to report "very" as an emendation, but its absence in the English edition must be recorded in the list of variants between the two editions. If, however, a copy could be found in which "very" prints—and that is certainly possible, since the book was printed from type, not plates—the situation would be reported differently. 33 These few examples are enough to suggest the way in which the editor of a critical edition is dependent on the facts uncovered in a search for the range of states that define ideal copy for a given issue. Critical editors can in any case make the emendations they consider necessary, but their range of options may be altered by the states located in an extensive examination of multiple copies—and what is regarded as an emendation or a variant may also be affected. There is no escaping the conclusion that the concept of ideal copy is as vital to the editor as to the bibliographer. Even though the concerns of editors are with texts as intellectual constructions, they must recognize that as full a knowledge as possible of the vehicles that physically convey those texts is essential to their work. Whether differences among copies of an issue are the result of accident or design, whether they improve or worsen the product, they qualify—so long as they were present in copies at the time of issue—for recording as states by the bibliographer and for examination as relevant textual evidence by the editor. Bibliographers, and theorists of descriptive bibliography as well, have been reluctant in the past to insist on the presentation of textual evidence in descriptive bibliographies; 34 it is tempting to say that an edition is the place for such information and to argue that further deterrents should not be brought forward to interfere with the production of descriptive bibliographies. But it is equally difficult not to agree with the view that textual differences are physical differences and that states of an issue or impression cannot be satisfactorily sorted out without taking textual variants into account. The notion that descriptive bibliographies should limit themselves to details necessary for identification, instead of providing fuller historical records, has now been discredited; but in any case, it is impossible to know what is necessary for identification—indeed, how many states there may be for identification—without being as fully acquainted as possible with all the differences among copies, including textual differences. A number of bibliographies during the last generation have incorporated the results of textual collation. 35 But where the interdependence of description and textual study has been particularly felt is in the large series of editions published in connection with, or following the guidelines of, the Center for Editions of American Authors and its successor, the Center for Scholarly Editions. 36 Bibliographies of varying quality existed for the authors that have been edited, but none was really satisfactory in providing the kind of history of publication that editors need. These editors therefore undertook much of the work that goes into producing a descriptive bibliography as part of their editorial research, and as a result the editorial matter in most of these editions now amounts to the most thorough bibliographical treatment we have of the works in question. Formal bibliographies have been planned in some cases to accompany these editions in due course, and such an arrangement—a bibliography and an edition emerging from the same research—is the best one imaginable. An edition must, in any case, establish the detailed printing and publishing history of a work and must in the process distinguish among impressions, issues, and states. And it should be likewise recognized that a descriptive bibliography cannot adequately record the printing and publishing history of a work without utilizing information secured through textual collation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III These considerations can perhaps best be summarized in the form of a new definition: The Standard or "ideal" copy, which is the subject of a bibliographical description, is a historical reconstruction of the form or forms of the copies of an impression or issue as they were released to the public by their producer . Such a reconstruction thus encompasses all states of an impression or issue, whether they result from design or from accident; and it excludes alterations that have occurred in individual copies after the time when those copies ceased to be under the control of the printer or publisher . A further statement can make more explicit the relation of binding to ideal copy, though what is said here is implied in the foregoing definition: When sheets of a book are released to the public unbound, the binding of individual copies is not part of the production history of the book but instead of the history of particular copies, and ideal copy excludes any binder's alterations not specifically called for by the evidence of the sheets themselves . When, on the other hand, the binding or casing of sheets is arranged for by the printer or publisher before publication, the process of binding or casing becomes a part of the production history of that book; and ideal copy embraces any alterations to the sheets made during this process, and embraces as well the binding or casing itself . This approach to ideal copy is somewhat different from the views of it that have been expressed previously, though I think it is in line with the spirit of the best of those earlier discussions. In particular, this approach departs from the usual concept of an ideal copy (in the singular) by suggesting that the standard to be described is not a single preferred form but a range of alternatives that encompasses all the states of each sheet as they were issued. It does not seem logical to distinguish those differences that affect the physical structure of the folded sheets (and thus the collation formula) from those differences that affect only the text printed on the sheets, and then to limit the concept of ideal copy to one of those categories. Both kinds of differences are physical, and both may result either from conscious intention or from accident—or from both at once, as when new errors are created in the process of making corrections. And it does not therefore seem reasonable to limit ideal copy to a single state or single collection of states: there is no reason to elevate either a first state or a second state to a position as a basic standard, since neither is necessarily closer to the "intended" standard of the producer. What a bibliography can more valuably concern itself with is constructing an accurate historical account of the various forms of an issue that were put on the market; the fact that one form of an issue may happen to be more "correct," either in the arrangement of its leaves or in the quality of its text, does not make it the standard for the issue, since copies exhibiting other states may also be authentic exemplars of the issue as a whole. The editor of a facsimile edition must select a single state of any given page to appear in the body of the facsimile (and may well choose the "uncorrected" state in many cases as being closer to the author's wishes); but the bibliographer has no such necessity for choice and indeed may offer a misleading historical picture if certain states are subordinated to a single "ideal copy." The bibliographer's task requires careful judgment and historical scholarship, just as the editor's does. But that judgment and scholarship must first of all be directed toward distinguishing between what has happened to copies of books since their release and what happened to them before that time. This essentially simple view of ideal copy —or whatever we choose to call the concept—emphasizes the distinction that must be basic to the historical study of books. And while the concept may be simple, the decisions to be made in determining the status of certain features of individual copies of books are frequently far from simple. Thinking about ideal copy as a concept inevitably leads one to consider the nature of library cataloguing and its relation to descriptive bibliography. The fact that there is sometimes a confusion in cataloguing as to the aim of the process—whether works (intellectual constructions) or books (physical objects) are being recorded—has previously been commented upon. 37 Insofar as catalogue entries are taken to concern physical books, a related confusion concerns whether each entry applies to a particular copy of a book or more generally to the issue or impression of which that copy is a part. Ostensibly, of course, a catalogue records the copies in a given collection and does not pretend to be a bibliography (which draws on evidence from many copies to present a generalized account). But matters are often not so clear-cut. There are instances in which a cataloguer consults some sources external to the book being catalogued (other copies of the book in the same collection, perhaps, or catalogues of other collections, or a standard reference work) but does not undertake the extensive research that underlies a bibliographical description. This situation causes no problem so long as the specific copy is accurately recorded, in whatever level of detail has been established, and any observations on the relation of that copy to others are labeled for what they are and documented. Where the trouble occurs is when a cataloguer blurs the distinction between the individual copy and the so-called ideal copy, blending details from both and not keeping either approach clearly in focus. It would seem that the Library of Congress has unwittingly been the culprit in fostering this confused view. The public distribution of LC printed catalogue cards, which began in 1901, has had its effect both on cataloguers at LC and on some cataloguers elsewhere: it has caused the former to subordinate the presumed defects of LC copies and the latter to believe, following the example set by the widely circulated LC cards, that the function of catalogue cards is to describe ideal copies. LC cards, it is true, mention what are taken to be imperfections in LC copies, but frequently in the form of notes to the basic entries, thus reversing the proper emphasis and placing in primary position entries that do not in fact correspond exactly to the copies they represent. Some people have argued that this approach does little harm in connection with twentieth-century books—and it is largely for twentieth-century books that LC cards have served other libraries' cataloguing needs. But it is a mistake to assume that differences are uncommon among copies of twentieth-century books: they are in fact quite common. Contrary to what many people still seem to believe, machine-printed books demand just as close scrutiny as hand-printed books and often present more perplexing problems. In any case, the distinction between a description based on a single copy and one that draws conclusions based on the evidence from many copies is essential and must apply to books of all periods. The emphasis in discussions of library cataloguing has of course now moved from card catalogues to computers, but this blurred distinction between individual and ideal copy, inherited from card-catalogue days, is still with us, and in an insidious form. Those who talk about computer-assisted national bibliographic networks often refer to, or at least assume the future existence of, a data base containing entries that can be regarded somehow as standard, without considering how entries supplied by individual libraries become converted into a more authoritative statement utilizing the evidence from the various copies reported. The networks that presently exist, like OCLC and RLIN, 38 are used to a large extent by their subscribing libraries as a means for producing catalogue cards: the libraries check to see whether a given item has already been entered into the system; if it has, they make any alterations they wish in the entry and then indicate that they are ordering cards, and if it has not been previously entered, they enter it and order the cards. The real importance of the system has nothing to do with cards, and the central bibliographical problem will remain even when cards are no longer a part of the thinking of those who consult the record. Even though individual libraries can change the recorded entries for their own purposes—or to fit their own copies—the question of what description is to appear on the screen of the terminal is still a matter of considerable importance. Is it simply the first copy to be entered in the system? Or is the network to offer in some way what it regards as the "best" entry for a given item? Can any library or individual that calls up an entry infer that what appears on the screen represents a standard against which any given copy is to be measured? At present OCLC generally provides only a single entry for an item, whereas RLIN allows users to see multiple entries when they exist. The latter approach is the only one that is defensible from a scholarly point of view, and in the long run it is the approach that will have to be made available in a consolidated international network. When entries are based on individual copies—if, that is, they really are, as they purport to be—there is no mechanical or easy way of selecting from them a single "basic" or "standard" entry. Nor is there any reason why we should expect, or desire, a single entry to be chosen for us. It would be unfortunate if, in the early stages of a new medium, we were to allow the confusions previously nourished by LC printed cards to dominate our thinking. Entries, regardless of their level of detail, that refer to an issue or impression as a whole can only be the result of an act of historical scholarship—which involves judgment and interpretation—and cannot be based on the examination of a single copy or on a superficial choice among the reports of several copies. Individuals or institutions (i.e., individuals representing institutions) may wish to construct such historical accounts, and there is nothing wrong with their entering the results into a data base, so long as what they enter is clearly labeled. Indeed, such scholarship should be encouraged and welcomed, just as printed bibliographies are welcomed when they mark an advance in knowledge through the play of an informed intelligence over the assembled pieces of evidence. This kind of description should have the same status whether it appears on a cathode ray tube or on a printed page; it is an act of integration, and it can be well done or badly done, and it may stand as the authority for a considerable time or be superseded in short order by superior work. The quality of particular pieces of research cannot be legislated, nor can scholarly authority be upheld by decree or administrative fiat. Thus any attempt to construct an electronic bibliographic network in which one description is elevated over others is ill-conceived; and there is similarly no legitimate way to admit into the system only a single attempt to describe ideal copy , any more than one can limit the number of printed bibliographies of a writer or subject, since each involves the interpretation of evidence, and more than one responsible interpretation may exist. The most satisfactory way of handling the situation is to require that every entry placed in the system be labeled as to whether it is an attempt to record a particular copy or an attempt at a more generalized description based on the examination of multiple copies; it goes without saying that the source of each entry should also be indicated. Then if one wishes, in consulting the system, to see what entries for the socalled ideal copy of a given book exist, one can call up those entries; or if one prefers to begin with, or place principal reliance on, the entry supplied for its copy by a particular library, one can proceed in that fashion. The user would be free to exercise judgment in selecting among the entries offered. In some cases one might wish to see the entry prepared by the library specializing in a given field (for an eighteenth-century American imprint one would want to see how the American Antiquarian Society had handled it); in other cases one might decide to look over all the entries for specific copies in the system, or perhaps only at those entries that attempt to generalize, depending on how reliable one judges them and their stated sources to be. The crucial point is that users (to say nothing of cataloguers) will know where they stand when every entry is labeled according to what it sets out to do (that is, whether it refers to one copy or to a whole issue) and when all such entries are available for inspection. As the system grows in this way, it will increasingly be able to demonstrate the advantages that computer assistance can offer to bibliographers. Provision will have to be made, of course, for recording many categories of physical data about books, 39 and there will have to be a general understanding that interest in books as physical objects is not limited to early or "rare" books but embraces all books. 40 The ways in which physical data can then be manipulated—to learn the printing characteristics of a particular period, place, or printer, for example—will be far superior to what has been possible in the past. But this vast structure of information will be meaningless if it does not rest on the scrupulous recording of details exactly as they appear in particular copies, with any more generalized descriptions clearly labeled as such. The same points naturally apply also to work on union catalogues or so-called short-title catalogues, which are the counterparts in printed or card form of the new computer networks. Such works contain entries for specific copies, but they also frequently contain consolidated entries that are meant to stand for a number of supposedly identical entries. The latter kind of entry comprises somewhat more evidence than an entry based on a single copy, but the extent to which it can be regarded as an entry for an issue as a whole depends on the depth and breadth of the research undertaken. In using the National Union Catalog: Pre-1956 Imprints , for example, one is bound to wish, in certain instances, that the individual entries supplied by different libraries for a given book had been retained, rather than grouping the symbols for those libraries under a single entry. Supposedly, of course, this kind of consolidation was not undertaken except where there were no significant differences among the individual cards; but in some cases one would like to see just how the consolidated entry was arrived at and what the individual entries consisted of. Katharine Pantzer's exemplary revision of the Pollard and Redgrave STC relies at some points on considerably more detailed bibliographical investigation, with the result that discriminations among copies carry much greater authority. Yet the number of titles involved precludes equally detailed treatment of all entries; and the copies grouped together under certain entries might not be so grouped in a full-scale descriptive bibliography based on the textual collation of all known copies. No one expects a short-title catalogue, even one with the high standards Miss Pantzer sets, to be a substitute for descriptive bibliographies of individual writers or books. What one recognizes is that a union catalogue or a short-title catalogue (of the kind that goes beyond the confines of a single collection) occupies a middle ground between a catalogue of single copies and a true bibliography. Falling thus in between two relatively well-defined types of work, it must be careful to define its exact position: the standards for deciding when two copies are to be accorded two separate entries rather than a single entry must be made clear if the user is to know how to interpret a given entry. The eighteenth-century short-title catalogue now in progress faces such an enormous task that the quantity of detail examined for each item cannot be as great as might be feasible for a smaller project. Short-title catalogues can operate—and serve an important function—at various levels of bibliographical detail. But the level at which a given catalogue is to be pitched is a central decision in establishing the catalogue and a central fact to be announced in it. In confronting an entry, the user needs to know what level of discrimination has produced it: one needs to know, in other words, what kinds of differences among copies have not been taken into account, and what kinds therefore may exist among the copies cited within a single entry. One cannot generally think of the entries in such catalogues as ideal copies, because frequently insufficient detail is provided to distinguish among states; on the other hand, the entries often represent more than one copy and rise above what are deemed to be the peculiarities of those copies. They are ideal copies of a kind, then, but not up to the standard implied by ideal copy in descriptive bibliography. As an intermediate category, they help to show up the problems with the phrase "ideal copy," because it is awkward to try to conceive of a quasi-ideal or a semi-ideal. A convenient term used in discussions of library cataloguing to refer to features of particular copies is "copy-specific"; when one generalizes on the basis of copy-specific details to produce a description that encompasses the individual copies, the result should logically be something on the order of "issue-specific" rather than "copy-ideal." Such descriptions are in fact generalizations or conclusions about the issue as a whole, based on the evidence of specific details. And the differences among short-title-catalogue entries and bibliographical descriptions rest on two variables that affect the nature of the generalization attempted in a given instance: the level of detail examined in each copy, and the number of copies surveyed. Short-title-catalogue entries by definition are limited in detail, and they may or may not be limited in the number of copies examined; but their function is not, as with bibliographical descriptions, to provide detailed printing and publishing histories. Nevertheless, they are like bibliographical descriptions in going beyond the evidence of single copies: the difference between them is of degree rather than kind. Whether the generic term for what they contain is "generalized description," "standard description," "issue description," or "ideal-copy description" is not of paramount concern. What is important is maintaining a clear distinction between that kind of description and "single-copy" or "specific-copy" description. The distinction between the single unit and the group of which it is a part is basic to all bibliographical and textual research; it must inevitably be pervasive in any endeavor concerned with the physical aspects of books.</field>

This paper has been succinctly criticized (as one "which will no doubt cause considerable harm and confusion" by Rolf E. DuRietz in "'The Fallacy of the Ideal Copy,'" Text , 2, no. 1 (1978), 31-34. In his comments DuRietz hopes that I will publish a "refutation of all this nonsense as soon as possible." The present essay was written before DuRietz's remarks appeared and was not conceived of as a reply to Miss Pouncey. Insofar as her remarks will be taken seriously enough to require a reply, DuRietz's comments serve the purpose very well. And although my own essay is not organized as a systematic examination of the points Miss Pouncey makes, I believe that it does contain the arguments required to reply to those points. 8 See G. T. Tanselle, "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing," SB , 30 (1977), 1-56. 9 In his important earlier article, "A Formulary of Collation" (see note 5 above), he refers to "the ideally perfect copy" as the subject of the collation, without at that point mentioning intention. But that intention is involved the context makes clear: cf. my further quotation from this piece in the discussion to follow. 10 Its character is certainly hypothetical; what differs from instance to instance is its likelihood of being true. 11 Although its original place as printed may also, when known, be made clear in the collation formula—as in "π1 (=M8)." 12 That is, they may be defined as anomalies on the basis of the evidence they present. Whether or not they are anomalies in a statistical sense cannot be known, since the evidence in the copies now lost cannot be recovered. 13 In his 1947 article (see note 6 above), he had defined it as "that form of the book which the printer or publisher wished to represent the most perfect and complete form to leave his shop" (p. 290). James G. McManaway used similar language in his contribution to the 1946-47 series of Rosenbach Fellowship lectures, where he defined ideal copy as "the book in the precise state in which the publisher intended it to be put on sale as complete and perfect" ( Standards of Bibliographical Description [1949], pp. 70-71). 14 At a later point Bowers succinctly says, "the intention of the printer should take precedence over what happened to be the practice of various binders" (p. 122). 15 An issue , because it is a consciously planned publishing unit, can be thought of as having an ideal copy (or perhaps more than one); an issue or impression may in turn consist of states , but because they do not represent discrete publishing efforts, they are not given separate descriptions as distinct ideal copies. States are subdivisions of an issue, produced by the effort to make corrections or additions that are not to be called to the public's attention; they are not intended as identifiable publishing units. Cf. G. T. Tanselle, "The Bibliographical Concepts of Issue and State ," PBSA , 69 (1975), 17-66. 16 One in which, as he says, "Nothing is invented. . . . Instead, all the evidence to be gained from the examination of numbers of copies is analyzed on the basis of the printing history of the edition, so far as it can be determined, in order to discover what was the actual most perfect form of the book achieved by the printer within an issue" (p. 113). The point is that this "form" is a composite of details from various copies and does not necessarily agree with any single actual copy. 17 The editor of a noncritical edition offers a closer parallel with the descriptive bibliographer; this point is discussed more fully below, in Part II. 18 This point is ironically demonstrated by the number of Rolf DuRietz's Text in which he comments on the Pouncey article (see note 7 above). At the center are two folds (eight pages) that are not counted in the pagination; they are blank except for the recto of the second leaf and the verso of the third. On the former of these is an announcement beginning, "These two inmost folds outside the pagination do not belong to the ideal copy of a complete bound volume 2 of TEXT. They are intended, most unbibliographically, to be removed and cancelled by the binder." DuRietz goes on to explain three functions that they serve (protecting the "inmost regular text fold" from the staples that hold the number together, protecting copying-machine glass from the staples, and providing space for listing errata) and adds information about the quality of the staples and the paper. The errata list, on the other printed page of these eight, is to be "reprinted on a regular page in a forthcoming issue of TEXT." However, despite the announced intention that these four leaves are to be excised and not to be considered a part of the ideal copy, history cannot be undone: the journal was in fact published with these leaves, which do contain text, and they are a part of the publication, whether its editor wishes them to be or not. In the future, copies lacking these leaves, far from being considered "ideal," will have to be regarded as defective. 19 Except to the extent that the present characteristics of individual copies must be recorded as documentation. 20 One cannot say simply "post-publication history of individual copies": if publication is taken to mean the time when the first copies are put on sale, then some post-publication changes can certainly be part of the production history of the book, in cases where the printer or publisher orders changes to be made in the copies not yet released. The distinction being made here relates to individual copies: what happened to each one before the time of its release as opposed to what happened to each one after that time. 21 When the publisher does call attention to a particular group of copies, as through a new title leaf or special binding, the result is a new issue of the book, which then has its own ideal copy. For more detailed discussion, see note 15 above and the article cited there. 22 Duplicated leaves are commonly regarded simply as a redundancy rather than a state. Yet if they become a feature of a copy during production rather than later, it is hard to see how logically they can be considered anything other than a state. Of course, one can always decide in certain cases that this one class of states will be relegated to the notes on individual copies and not be reported in the body of the description. Although this arrangement may seem best at times, in many instances it is bound to seem somewhat arbitrary and to raise more problems than it settles. If a substantial number of copies were found to contain the duplicated leaves, they would no doubt be regarded by most bibliographers as deserving of more attention. But when one is dealing with less than the full evidence, it is always difficult to say what relation a single copy with certain features bears to the whole issue. And in any case, if a feature is worthy of being recorded when it exists in large numbers, how can it be ruled out, when it is known only in a single copy, as not exemplifying one of the states in which the book was issued? The number of copies involved is likely to have an effect on one's thinking, but it cannot logically be allowed to determine what is reported as a state, if state is to be a term of historical classification, referring to what in fact took place. A cautionary example, involving what may be a cancel, is furnished by Jane Austen's Emma (1816). A copy was recently discovered in which M11 of volume 3 is a disjunct leaf pasted to a stub. Since this leaf corresponds exactly—textually and typographically—with the usual copies of M11, which are integral, one might be led to conclude that this copy is "made up"—that a missing M11 has been replaced by the corresponding leaf from another copy. However, a brief search has now turned up two more copies in which M11 is disjunct; the existence of three such copies makes one think that this supplied leaf may after all be a product of something that happened during the production of the book. The matter remains a puzzle: could the supplied leaf really be a cancel for a state of the text not yet located? The situation nevertheless illustrates that what may seem obvious when only one copy is known should not be confidently taken to be the correct explanation. 23 Something close to this point is implied by Philip Gaskell in his discussion of ideal copy in A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972). He says that a description of an ideal copy would note all leaves "which belonged to the most perfect copy of the work as originally completed by its printer and first put on sale by its publisher. This is the basic ideal form; and the description of ideal copy is completed by the addition of notes of any subsequent changes made by the printer or publisher . . . and of any unintentional alterations to its form" (p. 315). Despite the reference to a "basic ideal form," Gaskell seems in this passage to be moving toward the view I am setting forth here, suggesting that the description of idcal copy contains within it in chronological order the various states that historically existed. If, however, intended and unintended differences in copies put on sale later than the time when the first ones were put on sale are to be recorded, it is difficult to see why the "most perfect copy" as "first put on sale" should be the starting point, since there may have been other less "perfect" copies also offered for sale at that initial time and thus also deserving of a place in the historical record. When Gaskell repeats his definition of ideal copy a few pages later (p. 321), he introduces a significant difference: "It will be recalled," he says, "that the basic form of ideal copy is the most perfect state of a work as originally intended by its printer or publisher following the completion of all intentional changes." Of course, he had earlier, and more appropriately, used the phrase "as originally completed" instead of "as originally intended." 24 Bowers agrees that the "complete bibliographical description . . . apprises the reader of all variant states in which the described issue of the book is found" (p. 123). Where my approach is somewhat different from his is in suggesting that these states may be presented chronologically at the appropriate points in the main description, rather than that some of them be appended to a description of a single ideal copy. The information set forth is the same either way; but the rather arbitrary choices sometimes required to construct a single ideal copy may occasionally produce a misleading effect, one that can be avoided by treating the various states at the points where the elements they concern come up within the framework of the description. 25 In addition to the alternatives occasioned by the correction or the occurrence of error, there are of course planned differences among copies (as when copies are issued in various colors of casing cloth) and differences resulting from the nature of the publication plan (as when different original prints or other illustrations are tipped in to different copies). There are also those publications that allow for the rearrangement of their parts (such as boxes containing loose pieces, as in Marcel Duchamp's 1934 publication of facsimiles of 93 examples of his notes); in these cases there may or may not be any one arrangement of the pieces that can be described as standard or "ideal." Allan Stevenson, in his long introduction to the second volume of the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt (1961), is bothered by such variability among copies: finding that the positions of the plates in different copies of botanical books vary greatly, he calls ideal copy for these books a "will-o'-the-wisp" (p. clxxii). Yet ideal copy , by definition, must exist, regardless of the number of variations. If the publisher is responsible for the binding of copies, and thus for the insertion of the plates, then all the variations originally present become part of the description of ideal copy ; if the plates were inserted by binders employed by individual owners of copies, then the variations are of little significance compared to any binders' directions that were issued or any indications on the plates themselves announcing their intended locations. 26 For a discussion of the probabilities involved in drawing conclusions from a limited number of copies of an issue, see David Shaw, "A Sampling Theory for Bibliographical Research," Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 310-319. The problems of interpreting bibliographical evidence, including that arising from the existence of variant formes, are thoroughly analyzed by Fredson Bowers in Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). 27 An example from Greg's "Bibliography—An Apologia," Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932-33), 113-143: "what the bibliographer is concerned with is pieces of paper or parchment covered with certain written or printed signs. With these signs he is concerned merely as arbitrary marks; their meaning is no business of his" (pp. 121-122). Reprinted in his Collected Papers (see note 5 above), pp. 239-266 (p. 247). 28 This study is of course most fully set forth in The Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963). 29 For this reason, Bowers recommends the choice of uncorrected formes generally for facsimile editions (and they are the formes that would normally supply copy-text for critical editors). This point and related matters regarding press variants are carefully explored in his "The Problem of the Variant Forme in a Facsimile Edition," Library , 5th ser., 7 (1952), 262-272. He describes "the ideal photographic facsimile" as "a collection of formes from any number of copies, these formes being chosen first according to the principle of their textual state, and second according to clarity and fidelity of the inking" (p. 263). 30 Or to those in a given manuscript text; but the focus here, in the context of ideal copy, is of course on printed texts. 31 Miss Pouncey asks, "Can any Anglo-American analytical bibliographer be persuaded that the literary works which are the content of printed books are the products of the creative imagination, and that the creative imagination disallows mechanistic studies of its productions?" (p. 115). This question obviously confuses the works themselves with their means of transmission. The workings of the creative imagination are not mechanical; but so long as the resulting creations are transmitted by physical means, a "mechanistic" study of those means is clearly necessary for an informed approach to the content of the works thus transmitted. She had earlier asked, in similar vein, "to what avail is knowledge of the printing process when the editor must make a choice based on intuition?" (p. 109). But a detailed knowledge of the printing history of a book may settle some textual points conclusively and is thus necessary for establishing the limits within which editorial judgment (or "intuition") can operate. No matter how far editors may finally move beyond the physical evidence in their attempt to define the products of creative imagination, they must begin with that evidence and cannot in their speculations contradict it. 32 "'Wife' or 'wise'— The Tempest 1. 1786," SB , 31 (1978), 203-208. 33 The latter two examples are recorded in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Mardi (1970), p. 706, and White-Jacket (1970), p. 484; the former two will be reported in the forthcoming editions of The Piazza Tales and Moby-Dick . 34 For example, Fredson Bowers, in "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 1-22, says, "I do not see how, ordinarily, a descriptive bibliographer can be responsible for collating the texts" (p. 15), though he adds that the bibliographer should be able to "guarantee that every page of every listed copy is in the same setting and imposition unless specific exceptions have been made" (p. 16). Reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [1975], pp. 111-134 (pp. 127, 128). And I have myself said that "collations are theoretically part of the necessary background for every descriptive bibliography, whereas from a practical point of view it is unreasonable to demand them"—"The Use of Type Damage as Evidence in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), 328-351 (p. 351). 35 A recent example is James L. W. West III, William Styron: A Descriptive Bibliography (1977), which includes tables of variant readings. 36 A convenient list of these editions appears in the Modern Language Association's The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement (1977), pp. 5-6; this Statement is also printed in PMLA , 92 (1977), 586-597. 37 As in G. T. Tanselle, "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing" (see note 8 above). 38 These and other networks are identified, among other places, in an extremely useful introductory discussion of some of the issues that bibliographers should be aware of in relation to computer cataloguing: Terry Belanger and Stephen P. Davis, "Rare Book Cataloguing &amp; Computers," AB Bookman's Weekly , 63 (5 February 1979), 955-966. 39 The Independent Research Libraries Association has established a committee (which first met in Washington on 13-14 March 1979), under the chairmanship of Marcus A. McCorison, to consider ways of supplementing AACR2 (the second edition of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules ) and ISBD(A) (see the following note) to accommodate the interests of those concerned with the physical aspects of books. No library can be required to include extensive records of physical details in its cataloguing; but it is important to reserve spaces now that will allow for the recording of such details and to provide a standard framework for them so that any libraries wishing to note certain details will be doing it in the same way. It would be a mistake not to plan in this fashion for the future orderly accumulation of bibliographical details in a system that can make them easily retrievable. 40 The 1978 draft of ISBD(A)—that is, the International Standard Bibliographic Description designed to be a counterpart, for antiquarian (A) books, of ISBD(M), which is primarily concerned with current monographs (M)—states specifically that it deals with the special problems of "older books." Its scope is defined as "requirements for the description and identification of non-serial printed items issued before the year 1801, as well as for later works when the items are produced by hand or by methods continuing the tradition of the hand-produced book" (0.1.1.). Machine-produced books, however, are also of interest as artifacts, and recognition should be given to the fact that details about their production can be equally valuable to have on record. Thus when the introduction to ISBD(A) says, "for older books all leaves are important, even blanks," the opening prepositional phrase is actually superfluous and imposes an unnecessary limitation. The particular approach to books which ISBD(A) attempts to accommodate is in fact not limited to hand-produced books: what distinguishes that approach is a focus on books as physical objects, a focus which obviously is relevant to any books of any period.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">An Application of Semiotics to the Definition of Bibliography by Ross Atkinson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Bibliography, as Greg remarked in 1914, "suffers from its name." 1 The problem is not, however, that the word can no longer be precisely defined on the basis of its etymologically derived parts. Some of its current uses, as will be noted later, do in fact correspond quite closely to the combination of βιβλιον and γραøω, but even if this were not so, verbal meaning does after all vary with time and place, and it is neither unusual nor any cause for concern if our usage of the word does not coincide with that of Dr. Johnson or Lucian. The problem today in English lies rather in the multiplicity of meanings assigned to the name "bibliography," as well as in the relationship between them, for bibliography "is not 'a subject' but a related group of subjects that happen to be commonly referred to by the same term." 2 It is through the application of a variety of descriptive adjectives to the term "bibliography" that its various "subjects" are usually differentiated. These adjectives, like so much other fundamental terminology in the field, have gained acceptance as a result of the persistent efforts of Professor Bowers to provide bibliography with a theoretical basis. Robert Heilbroner, in a recent article on Karl Marx, has maintained that the reason "why Marx asserts and reasserts his intellectual thrall" in the social sciences is "not because he is infallible," but rather "because he is unavoidable." 3 The same may be said of the "intellectual thrall" Anglo-American bibliography finds in the work of Fredson Bowers, and while we obviously cannot claim, as Heilbroner does for Marx, that Professor Bowers created "a whole new mode of inquiry," we can nevertheless say that Bowers has essentially created the basis upon which the whole "mode of inquiry" known as bibliography views itself and defines its various activities. Any discussion of the general nature of bibliography must, therefore, be founded upon the fundamental pronouncements of Professor Bowers, according to whom there are four—or sometimes five—distinct but related branches of bibliography: enumerative, analytical, descriptive, textual, and—sometimes—historical. 4 In the area of descriptive bibliography there was a call not long ago to replace the work of the "splitters" with that of the "groupers," in other words to cease expending so much energy on the description of minute details of individual documents and to begin to concentrate on the assemblage of broader bibliographic data of more demonstrable value to critics and collectors. 5 A similar tendency to replace splitting with grouping is already apparent in some current efforts to categorize and define the various branches of bibliography. Paul Dunkin, for example, has recently seen fit to define all bibliography as simply that field of study designed "to locate books." 6 Most grouping efforts, however, have attempted to split bibliography into two broad categories. Probably the clearest and best received of these has been Lloyd Hibberd's suggestion that the subject be divided into "physical bibliography" and "reference bibliography," 7 about which distinction more will be said later. Another of the most recent attempts to accomplish a general grouping may be found in the current Encyclopaedia Britannica article on "Bibliography" by Sir Frank Francis, who conservatively divides the entire field into "descriptive bibliography" and "critical bibliography." 8 Aside from Francis' surprising choice of the old and ambiguous term "critical bibliography" 9 to describe "the study of books as material objects," the most remarkable part of his article is his apparent combination of descriptive bibliography in the sense of Bowers with enumerative bibliography. 10 The suggestion that descriptive bibliography replace its "splitters" with "groupers" was understood by its originator to be "a call back to the past" (Liebert, p. 10), and it may appear that recent grouping efforts in the area of general definition are similar attempts to return to a pre-Bowers state of innocence. This would be, however, an incorrect assumption, for Professor Bowers, unlike Greg, has in fact never denied that bibliography is divisable into two broad categories. On the contrary, he actually adopted this perspective in his own Encyclopaedia Britannica article: . . . in modern times the word bibliography is ordinarily associated with two sets of activities: (1) enumerative (or systematic) bibliography, the listing according to some system or reference scheme of books that have a formal relationship; and (2) analytical (or critical) bibliography, the examination of books as tangible objects with a view to the recovery of the details of the physical process of their manufacture. . . . The application of such information [obtained through analytical bibliography] . . . usually takes the form of (a) descriptive bibliography or (b) textual bibliography. (p. 588) The next question we must ask, then, is whether such a bifocal view of the word "bibliography" is justified, especially since the second meaning—the study of books as material objects—appears to be limited to English usage. According to Rudolf Blum, who has made a thorough study of the history of the use of the term in French and German speaking countries, many influential continental bibliographers included at one time the physical history of printed matter as part of the subject of bibliography. One of the first of these was the Viennese scholar Michael Denis, whose widely used Einleitung in die Bücherkunde (Vienna: Trattner, 1777-78) was divided into two parts: "Bibliographie" and "Literargeschicht." While the second part has an enumerative function, listing the main literature of various disciplines, the first part, "Bibliographie," is devoted to such matters today referred to in English as historical bibliography. 11 Blum maintains (col. 1112), furthermore, that it was Denis who probably provided the basis for the distinction made by Jean François Née de la Rochelle between "literary bibliography" and "typographical bibliography": La Science Bibliographique se divise en deux branches, dont l'une tient à la Littérature, &amp; l'autre au mécanisme de l'Art Typographique; celle-ci sert à déterminer la forme, &amp; l'autre à juger du fonds. 12 As a result primarily of the categorical formulations of J. S. Ersch and C. G. Schütz, the term in German was already restricted to its enumerative meaning by the late eighteenth century. Historical bibliography was given the separate designation "Geschichte des Buchwesens," which it still has today (Blum, cols. 1149-1153). In France, however, the state's sudden acquisition of rare and valuable books confiscated from private libraries during the Revolution brought about a requirement for extensive research into historical bibliography. 13 Enumerative and historical bibliography were thus necessarily fused in French bibliography throughout much of the nineteenth century, and it was not until 1934, according to Malclès (p. 7), that bibliographie in France was officially restricted to its enumerative sense. English usage apparently never abandoned the double view of the term. The 1830 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana still includes both meanings in its definition: bibliography "is, therefore, divided into two branches, the first of which has reference to the contents of books, and may be called for want of a better phrase, intellectual bibliography ; the second treats of their external character, the history of particular copies, etc., and may be termed material bibliography ." 14 In his 1892 inaugural address, Copinger was still making use of the same terminology. 15 Professor Bowers' division of bibliography into two general categories is, consequently, the latest stage in this process. Yet here must be injected a word of caution, for between Copinger and Bowers something happened which is usually referred to as the New Bibliography. It is not to be assumed that the uniquely Anglo-American New Bibliography simply carried forward the old meaning of material bibliography. On the contrary: we might even go so far as to say that the New Bibliography actually eliminated material bibliography as an independent subject and squeezed aspects of it into the other side of the field in a way not unlike that which occurred in France and Germany in the previous two centuries. Copinger's idea of material bibliography was "for example, Brunet's Manuel ; Ebert, &amp;c." (p. 31), names which today are primarily associated with enumerative, or at most proto-descriptive bibliography. Professor Stokes clouds the issue somewhat when he suggests that Hibberd's divisions are similar to the old divisions (p. 21), for material bibliography—as it was understood when the term was in current use—is quite a different thing from Hibberd's "physical bibliography" or Lancour's "Book as Physical Entity," 16 since it knew practically nothing of the recovery of the mechanical processes of individual book production. Indeed, what was essentially new about the New Bibliography was that it did not so much augment nineteenth-century material bibliography as replace it with something different which today goes under the name of analytical bibliography. There is, therefore, no such established term as analytical bibliography in French or German because there is to no great extent any such thing . 17 Any objections to the continued use of the designation "analytical bibliography" on grounds that it is either antiquated or that it does not coincide with the meaning of the term "bibliography" in other Western European languages are consequently unfounded. 18 It may be accepted, then, as an established condition, that the subject of bibliography in English is divisible into two broad categories or divisions—one primarily concerned with the listing of documents, the other with the study of documents as material objects—and that other branches of bibliography may be arrayed as subdivisions beneath these two divisions. What has not yet been sufficiently established, however, is a precise definition of these divisions and subdivisions in relation to each other . Professor Stokes, who has written an entire book on the categories of bibliography, provides a thoughtful and useful exposition of the characteristics of Bowers' five distinctive categories, yet although Stokes' purpose is "to bind up the parts and create a mutual awareness of interdependency" (p. 9), he does not believe in strict categorization. His book, therefore, is mainly descriptive: it contains no final conclusion and the reader is consequently left "to bind up the parts" for himself on the basis of the preceding descriptions. Hibberd's laudable effort to divide bibliography into two generic categories acceptable to all bibliographers is weakened somewhat by his preference for subdividing these two categories into a set of phases rather than into distinct disciplines or activities. Also, it is incorrect to believe, as many bibliographers seem to, that Hibberd's "reference bibliography" is "the term suggested for what has been called 'enumerative' or 'systematic' bibliography." 19 The fact is that Hibberd (p. 128) includes all five of Bowers' branches, including enumerative bibliography, under the category of "physical bibliography." Enumerative bibliography is, in Hibberd's scheme, the first phase of both physical and reference bibliography (p. 130). 20 It should, of course, be noted at once that Hibberd's aim—like that of Stokes—is not to posit hair-splitting definitions but rather apparently to throw light on the characteristics or processes of his two categories with the ultimate goal of showing that they are "not antagonistic but complementary" (p. 133). This is hardly surprising since both Hibberd and Stokes have relied heavily—as one must—on Professor Bowers' definitions which are themselves to a very great extent based on principles of reciprocal applicability . That is indeed the current trend which Professor Bowers has established in the definition of bibliography. His distinctions have always been immensely practical and are based less upon what a thing is than on what it does or rather how it can be used. Professor Stokes' rejection of abstract definition in favor of a description of applications (the "only valid definition of an orange is to eat one" [p. 10]) is indicative of this trend. But bibliography not only does, it also is. Thanks especially to the work of Professor Bowers the field is fairly well established as a legitimate discipline, and we who have inherited this legacy need no longer feel constrained to provide pragmatic justifications for its every activity. It is now possible—and necessary—to view bibliography and its various branches as entities unto themselves and to define them no longer from the standpoint of their applicability to each other or to allied disciplines, but rather on the basis of their own characteristics, which is only to say on the basis of how as activities they relate to their objects of study . This is important: for if we intend to establish exactly how the various branches relate to each other, we must first define them on the basis of their separate relationships to their objects. And what is, generally speaking, bibliography's object of study? In all cases it is the same: material media designed and used for the transmission of information. Since information is essentially immaterial, 21 it must be encrypted into a material sign system by some "emitter" (as an author) in order to be transmitted to some receiver (e.g. the reader) and subsequently decrypted . The objects of study of bibliography are material sign systems. It is therefore reasonable to make use of some of the elementary concepts of semiotics—the science of signs—in order to determine the relationships of the various branches of bibliography to their objects and ultimately to each other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Semiotics (sometimes called semiology) originated at about the same time as the New Bibliography, in the early years of the present century. Its places of origination were Switzerland and the United States. The reason for this dual citizenship of semiotics is that the field was created at about the same time by two scholars working independently in different disciplines: the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913), the founder of structural linguistics, and the American philosopher C. S. Peirce (1839-1914), usually credited with the foundation of American pragmatism. 22 Since most of the work of both men was published posthumously, it is not possible to say precisely when semiotics came into being. Neither Peirce nor Saussure had apparently any knowledge of the work of the other. Their separate systems, therefore—Saussure's linguistically based semiotics and Peirce's logically based semiotics—seldom overlap, so that combining the two into one great system would be a very complex task. Most work in semiotics is consequently accomplished through the application of either one system or the other. It is to Peirce's logical semiotics that we should now direct our attention, or rather to one small aspect of it, namely the Second Trichotomy of Signs. While the Second Trichotomy may have attained some notoriety among philosophers because it is "Peirce's most important division of signs," 23 the popularity it has achieved outside of philosophy is probably more a result of the fact that it is, at least on the surface, one of the easiest of Peirce's many sets of definitions to understand. Even so, it should be well noted that what follows in no way presumes to be anything like a complete exposition of Peirce's Second Trichotomy, for Peirce's philosophy was systematic, 24 and to discuss any single part without reference to the whole is open to justifiable charges of misrepresentation. Our subject is bibliography, however, not philosophy, and if we end up ignoring the full philosophical implications of Peirce's categories—which we will—it is because the full implications are not essential to our subject. We are concerned here not with what Peirce ultimately meant, but rather with the application to our own subject of an isolated segment of what he said. Peirce was of the opinion that logic is basically semiotics, the "quasi-necessary, formal, doctrine of signs" (II,134). A sign is simply "something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity" (II,135). Words, for instance, are signs, most of which stand for specific objects or actions. All such semiotic relationships consequently consist of three parts: there is the sign (Peirce's word is "representamen"), there is the entity for which the sign stands (its "Object"), and there is one's mental image (the "interpretant") of the object triggered by one's encounter with the sign. Semiotics—or logic—consists, according to Peirce, of three parts: speculative grammar, critical logic, and speculative rhetoric. Speculative grammar, "the first and most fundamental of Peirce's three main divisions" is primarily concerned with "the meaning of signs and symbols" (Feibleman, p. 89). A central aspect of speculative grammar is the idea that all signs are divisible into three trichotomies. 25 The second and most famous of these divides signs into three categories from the standpoint of their relationships to their Objects. Peirce named these three categories of signs "icons," "indexes," and "symbols." An icon is a "sign which refers to the Object that it denotes merely by virtue of characteristics of its own . . ." (II,143). It is linked to its object by virtue of similarity . A portrait of someone, for example, is an icon. An index is a "sign which refers to the Object that it denotes by virtue of being really affected by that Object" (II,143). It is linked to its object by virtue of causality . The symptoms of a disease are indexes to that disease. A symbol is a "sign which refers to the Object that it denotes by virtue of a law . . ." (II,143). Peirce's concept of the symbol is often accepted as being very similar to Saussure's definition of the linguistic sign. Most linguistic signs are arbitrary, or rather the connection between the sign and its Object (the "signifier" and the "signified" to use the English equivalents of Saussure's own terms) is an arbitrary one. There is no reason, for example, why the sounds which make up the word "tree" should refer to a large plant with branches. They do so only on the basis of convention , or as Peirce would have it, by virtue of a "law." A word, then, in Peirce's terms, is a symbol. Before proceeding to apply these categories to the field of bibliography, we must first make one terminological adjustment. While Peirce uses the word "Object" to denote that entity for which the sign stands, we shall instead use the word referent . Thus the word "tree" is a sign and its referent is a large plant with branches. We will continue to use the word "Object" in a non-semiotic sense specifically to denote the object of study of a particular discipline. Thus the Object of all bibliography, as we have already noted, is a document or any material medium (i.e. sign system) designed and used for the transmission of information.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The decryption of written or printed signs (graphemes) on the basis of linguistic convention is a definition for the process of reading. The signs fall under the Peircean category of symbol. A thorough analysis of the meaning and significance of such signs in certain kinds of documents (especially those which convey imaginary information) is the primary activity of the professional reader or literary critic. Sign decryption in the field of analytical bibliography, on the other hand, is quite different since, to begin with, it is not accomplished on the basis of linguistic convention. Criticism cannot avoid treating these inked shapes [impressed on leaves of paper] as meaningful symbols with literary values. Bibliographical analysis, at least at the start, tries to treat them as significant in the order and manner of their shapes but indifferent in symbolic meaning. 26 Although it is unlikely that Professor Bowers had in mind the Peircean concept of "symbolic meaning," his explanation nevertheless coincides neatly with the semiotic distinctions outlined above. It is not that the inked shapes on the page have no meaning in analytical bibliography, but rather that they indeed have no symbolic, i.e. verbal meaning. They do, however, constitute a sign system—or at least part of one—and they do consequently transmit meaning for the analytical bibliographer (otherwise there would be little point in his study of them). Both the bibliographer and the reader, therefore, assign separate referents, i.e. separate meanings, to essentially the same set of signs. 27 If the reader, then, accomplishes sign decryption on the basis of linguistic convention, how is essentially the same set of signs decrypted by the analytical bibliographer? "Analytical bibliography concentrates on the examination of books as tangible objects in order to recover the details of the physical process of their manufacture." 28 In other words, the purpose of analytical bibliography is to establish, through intensive examination and with the assistance of previously gathered information on techniques of book production (historical bibliography), how a particular document (or set of documents) came physically to be the way it is. That is the essential function of analytical bibliography. 29 The relationship between the sign and its referent is for the analytical bibliographer causal . Thus signs which from the standpoint of the reader are symbolic, must be understood by the analytical bibliographer to be indexical. Let us now turn to enumerative bibliography. The enumerative bibliographer is traditionally concerned with the intellectual content of publications. 30 Yet again: our purpose here is to establish the precise relationship of enumerative bibliography to a sign system constituting a document. We must do this in order to obtain an exact definition, for to define enumerative bibliography as, for example, "primarily concerned with the ideas in books and their circulation among men" 31 is to fail to note those characteristics which render its activities unique and distinct from all others. Does the enumerative bibliographer, then, like the reader, indeed view a text as a set of symbolic signs, the decryption of which depends upon linguistic convention? Yes and no. Clearly the enumerative bibliographer must understand the verbal content of the text, yet while this is the essential function of reading, it is only a means to accomplish the essential function of enumerative bibliography, namely the production of "a list of books arranged according to some permanent principle." 32 It is therefore reasonable to maintain that ultimately the enumerative bibliographer does not view the document as a sign system but rather as a set of referents to which a sign system of his own generation, i.e. his bibliography, is to refer. This is admittedly a difficult point, but it is valid. The reader is concerned about what the verbal signs in the text signify. The enumerative bibliographer is rather concerned only that they signify concepts which fall within the confines of the "permanent principle" upon which his selection of documents is based (although obviously in order to accomplish this he must be aware of what they verbally signify). The essential activity of the enumerative bibliographer, then, involves in all cases the generation of what we might call "meta-signs," that is to say signs which specifically signify other signs. And what, finally, is the relationship of enumerative bibliography as sign system to its Object, i.e. to the documents it lists? "Les répertoires [bibliographiques] imprimés depuis le XV e siècle, qui se comptent aujourd'hui par dizaines de milliers, sont des nomenclatures de textes, également imprimés ." 33 Bibliographies are "printed" works listing "printed" works. Their purpose, and the purpose of enumerative bibliography in general, is duplication or representation. This is not to say that enumerative bibliography is not a creative discipline. It is very much so: its creativity is, however, restricted to the origination of meta-sign systems and their subsequent coordination (i.e. classification according to the "permanent principle"), and does not involve the relationship of the meta-signs qua signs to their referents. An enumerative bibliography reproduces its Object in microcosm; it is a reflection, a picture of its Object. As such, the relationship between sign and referent in enumerative bibliography is one of similarity and may consequently be designated iconic. 34 This most essential feature of enumerative bibliography is clearly visible in all areas of that field. The purpose of subject bibliography, for example, is to provide a relatively concise representation of an individual subject through the abbreviated duplication of some or all of its constituent documentation. Part of this duplicating or representational process may consist of what are traditionally known as annotations. Hibberd's "text-as-text" versus "text-as-content," and "external description" versus "internal description" (p. 131) are valid and useful distinctions, yet only inside the sphere of iconic sign systems. A description of the contents of a publication—which is the function of most annotations—remains at its most basic level an (often difficult) exercise in duplication. That is the essential relationship between enumerative bibliography and the document. Since every document is itself a sign system, and since every sign system involves "something" standing for "something else," it is only natural that efforts are made not only to duplicate certain signs contained in a document but also to represent certain parts of the meaning for which certain signs stand. "External description" tends to reproduce signs, "internal description" tends to reproduce referents. The point is in any case that enumerative bibliography does not create new content but rather duplicates (re-presents) content which already exists. 35 If the relationship of the signs of an enumerative bibliography to their referents defines such signs as essentially iconic, the relationship of the signs of a descriptive bibliography to their referents must be the same, only more so. The function of descriptive bibliography—whether comprehensive or degressive—is to duplicate certain portions (Hibberd would say "external" portions) of documents with great precision. The call for the use of photographic processes to aid description is indicative. 36 Even if the ultimate purpose of the activity is understood to be the description of an ideal copy, moreover, the relationship of the description to its Object is none the less one of duplication, for its Object consists of certain features of a document as the printer intended them to appear. It is a central quality of the icon that "it affords no assurance that there is any such thing in nature [i.e. its referent]. But it is of the utmost value for enabling its interpreter to study what would be the character of such an object in case any such could exist" (Peirce, IV,359). Any elementary book on physics will normally contain a diagram of an atom, even though no one (yet) has ever seen one distinctly. The diagram is rather a representation of how an atom should appear on the basis of all currently available evidence. The description of an ideal copy is a similar effort to represent the characteristics of an entity not itself subject to autopsy. 37 It is time, then, to reject the view that there is a generic difference between enumerative and descriptive bibliography. The difference is quantitative only. This is clear from many formulations made by Professor Bowers: If a descriptive bibliography is compared with an enumerative bibliography devoted to the same primary documents, however, three major differences may be discerned . . .: (1) a descriptive bibliography is usually more definitive in respect to the number of primary documents listed; (2) a descriptive bibliography is more definitive in the identification and arrangement of the material; and (3) a descriptive bibliography may contain information of interest to more purposes than the immediate one of identification. ( Ency. Brit. , p. 590, my italics) Both enumerative and descriptive bibliography, moreover, rely on analytical bibliography, although it would probably be most accurate to state that enumerative bibliography does or should rely on the results of analytical bibliography, while descriptive bibliography relies on its techinques. It is obviously impossible to produce a descriptive bibliography without an analytical study of the various conditions of the documents described. Yet analysis and description are nevertheless two entirely separate operations: in the former the document is treated as a product of certain mechanical procedures, in the latter the document (in its various conditions) is approached as a set of representable characteristics—a raw material—from which a product, the description, is to be created. This latter treatment of the document is, at this general level of categorization, identical to that of enumerative bibliography. Another point used to differentiate enumerative from descriptive bibliography is that the latter should be confined to the description of primary works. 38 There appears, however, to be no reason to preclude the application of Professor Bowers' excellent system of description to secondary works as well, always assuming, of course, that the result justifies the effort. The designations "primary" and "secondary" are, in any case, relative. The Life of Samuel Johnson may be either primary or secondary, depending on whether it is being regarded from the standpoint of Johnson or Boswell. One value of the original distinction between enumerative and descriptive bibliography was that it emphasized the degree of precision possible in bibliographic description. That was a point well worth making and a point well made, but the time eventually comes when categories introduced with the best of didactic or polemical intentions outlive their usefulness and begin to impede the progress of the discipline they were originally designed to promote. When that point is reached, such categories must be discarded and replaced by others more reflective of actual conditions. It would be comfortable to stop here—to sit back and complacently view the symmetry. Once we have embarked upon a particular analytical route, however, we are obliged by the requirement for consistency to continue upon that route until we arrive at its ultimate conclusion. And the ultimate conclusion is this: if the relationship of enumerative bibliography to its Object does indeed involve the reproduction of portions of that Object, and if that of descriptive bibliography is the same only with greater precision and in greater detail, then there must be a final level of such a representational relationship at which the goal is to reproduce the Object with maximum precision and in every detail. The name we give to the discipline practiced at that level is, of course, textual criticism. That is to say, then, that the activity of textual criticism, by virtue of its most elementary function—the reproduction with the greatest possible accuracy of sign systems which either once actually existed or which were intended to exist—can and must be described as the concentration of the essential representational activity of enumerative and descriptive bibliography onto a single, total document. The only difference, at this level of basic definition, between the citation of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus in the NCBEL, its description in Greg's A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , and its reproduction in the textual portion of Greg's 1950 critical edition of the play, is the degree to which the document is duplicated. This conclusion may be underscored somewhat by recalling that the relationship between textual criticism and reading is practically identical to that noted above between reading and enumerative bibliography. Reading provides a means to carry out the operations of textual criticism, but it does not constitute the essential characteristics which distinguish textual criticism from all other activities. Once again: while the reader uses sign systems to arrive at verbal meaning, the textual critic uses verbal meaning derived through the process of reading as an assistance to arrive at the proper representation of the sign system. Textual criticism, like descriptive bibliography, draws heavily upon analytical bibliography as well. It is now a fairly well accepted premise (at least in Anglo-American scholarship) that any literary critic who relies on a text produced without the assistance of analytical bibliography will sooner or later end up criticizing soiled fish. The application of analytical bibliography to textual criticism is indeed so fundamental that a name has actually been coined for it: textual bibliography. Two remarks must be made on this term, one concerning its nature, the other its effect. First, textual bibliography is not—or at least not yet—a discipline in itself: the term rather signifies the application of one discipline to another (what we will later designate an "efficient relationship"). As such it can have no place in any strict taxonomy of bibliographic disciplines. Second, introduction of the term has tended to re-enforce the notion that analytical bibliography and textual criticism are generically related. 39 Such a notion is typical of inaccuracies which can arise when activities are defined on the basis of their relationship with each other rather than first on the basis of their relationship with their Objects. Textual criticism is far more closely related as an activity to descriptive (or even enumerative) bibliography than to analytical bibliography, for like descriptive bibliography it views its Object essentially as a set of representable signs from which a product—a critical edition—is to be fashioned (always assuming, of course, that we equate textual criticism with editing). This is an entirely separate activity from approaching the document as a set of signs to be decrypted, which is the essential function of analytical bibliography. By its very nature bibliography is a highly conservative field and reevaluation of established definitions and categories is perhaps not as welcome as it is elsewhere. It should be noted, however, that a definition of bibliography in the sense of the iconic constellation of "enumerative bibliography—descriptive bibliography—textual criticism" (hereafter: "EDT") as a reduplicative sign system is, from one point of view at least, a very conservative one, for it reflects the original meaning of the word quite closely. βιβλιογραøια means "the writing of books," not in the modern sense of "authoring" but in the literal, physical sense, i.e. duplication by means of written signs. A βιβλιογραøοζ is a scribe or copiest, so that to define certain forms of bibliography in terms of their function of reproducing all or part of selected texts is hardly to change the original meaning of the word at all. We are left now only with the problem of historical bibliography. Professor Bowers' most precise definitions are found in his Encyclopaedia Britannica article. There he does not consider historical bibliography as properly belonging to the field, but states instead: "Ancillary to analytical bibliography . . . are the numerous fields concerned with the study of printing and its processes both as art and as craft" (p. 588). One must agree that historical bibliography is not, properly speaking, bibliography at all. This is because it does not have as its Object material sign systems or documents. Its Object rather consists primarily of certain mechanical techniques and as such it must be considered not part of bibliography but a constitutent of such fields as the history of technology or, perhaps, information science. Its relationship to analytical bibliography, moreover, is frequently somewhat similar to the relationship of language to reading: historical bibliography often provides the causal basis for sign decryption in analytical bibliography just as language provides the conventional basis for sign decryption in reading. Let us return now to the subject of analytical bibliography and summarize the semiotic basis for its isolation. a. the sign : while many (but by no means all) of the signs considered by the analytical bibliographer have the same form (i.e. inked shapes on paper) as those considered by the reader, they invariably have a different referent or meaning. For the analytical bibliographer they do not equate to mental images but rather to activities of those responsible for the production of the document. This distinguishes analytical bibliography from reading. b. the referent : the essential activity of analytical bibliography involves the acceptance of the Object as a closed set of signs which require decryption. It does not approach the document as a referent for which a new set of signs (what we have called "meta-signs") is to be generated. This distinguishes analytical bibliography from EDT. c. the relationship of the sign to the referent : in analytical bibliography the sign is related to its referent on the basis of physical causality, not on the basis of similarity or convention. The relationship in Peircean terminology is consequently indexical rather than iconic or symbolic. This distinguishes analytical bibliography from both EDT and reading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV We may now turn finally to the problem of the relationships between the various branches of bibliography. Most of what has been previously established can be summarized in the following diagram which, for purposes of completeness, includes the process of reading. Σ represents a closed material sign system or document (what we have been calling the Object), R stands for reading, and A for analytical bibliography. Broken lines in the above diagram represent objective relationships, i.e. that of an activity to its Object. These are the relationships we have been using to define the branches of bibliography, but they may also be used to assist in the definition of the relationships between the branches. Thus the unbroken vertical lines (between EDT) represent generic relationships. The activities in such a relationship form a class, the basis for which is that their relationships to their Object do not differ in essential quality but only in degree. Members of this class are related through the possession of similar attributes, but not by any operational interdependence. Each activity operates independently of the others, and knowledge of any special, non-essential requirements of one such activity is not necessary for the successful operation of another. Since EDT does form a distinct class, we may now provide it with a generic designation: representational bibliography . Horizontal arrows stand for efficient relationships. Such a relationship arises when one activity is necessarily affected by another essentially different activity. We must use arrows rather than simply lines because such an efficient relationship is directional and the arrows indicate the direction of influence from the causal entity to the affected one. Thus while the elements in a generic relationship are independent or simultaneous, an efficient relationship is one of dependence or succession. One particularly problematic area in the distinctions made by Professor Bowers has been that his preference for describing textual criticism and descriptive bibliography mainly in terms of analytical bibliography has tended occasionally to draw attention away from the unique characteristics of the latter. This has, per force , weakened another of his central arguments, namely that analytical bibliography "can be pursued independently of any limited objective" ( Ency. Brit. , p. 588). The distinction between generic and efficient relationships should alleviate this problem, for it establishes analytical bibliography as a generically separate activity in its own right which, at the same time, can be related on a different level than the generic to the separate activities of representational bibliography. But on what basis may we posit such efficient relationships? Again, only on the basis of objective relationships. The relationship between reading and its Object is essentially interpretive (ι1). It functions to interpet the individual meanings of the signs in the system as verbal symbols. The relationship between analytical bibliography and the same Object is also essentially interpretive (ι2), for it, too, interprets the meanings of signs in the system, although it views them as mechanical indexes. This is significant: for to state only—as has been the common practice—that analytical bibliography serves textual criticism which in turn serves literary criticism is a rather limited, "two dimensional" view of the functions of these fields. Only by adding the "third dimension" of the objective relationship do we realize that analytical bibliography as an activity has much more in common with literary analysis (i.e. reading) than with either descriptive bibliography or textual criticism, since both reading and analytical bibliography are essentially interpretive activities. If we were to oversimplify the entire system, which might be justifiable, say, in the classroom for pedagogical purposes, we could state that analytical bibliography, as opposed to representational bibliography, is simply another form of reading: the analytical bibliographer merely "reads" in a different "language," namely that provided often by historical bibliography. The semiotic systems recognized by the literary critic and the analytical bibliographer are different, but the fundamental skills applied to the two systems are essentially the same. The objective relationship, on the other hand, of representational bibliography is—as we have defined it—one of duplication (δ). Its essential function is to duplicate sign systems, yet prior to such duplication, decisions must be made concerning which signs are to be duplicated: which titles in which order, which "internal" and "external" data, which variants. Most of these decisions can only be made through interpretation of the signs available. Thus interpretation necessarily precedes and affects duplication, although it remains a generically separate operation. It should, in conclusion, be emphasized that analytical bibliography, no less than reading, may as a distinct activity, produce results in any single instance which do not necessarily affect representational bibliography. Chain-line direction, for example, may be a sign which sometimes decrypts to half-sheet imposition, yet that information may not necessarily influence decisions made in the critical edition of many documents where such indexical signs are found. What is the value, then, of results of analytical bibliography which do not specifically affect representational bibliography? Many bibliographers begin as literary critics, yet they quickly seem to forget that the practitioners of humanistic literary criticism (as opposed to Marxism or other forms of criticism which accept absolutes outside of the text) have no easy time justifying their existence. To say, then, that analytical bibliography is the "grammar" (or the "dictionary") of literary investigation, to maintain that it exists only to be applied to the production of accurate texts upon which literary criticism may securely ply its craft is not much of a justification. The simple fact is rather that any set of signs, once recognized as such, necessarily contains within itself a number of problems: what do the signs signify? how did they come to be the way they are? how do they relate to other signs? can they be replicated or imitated? The only difference between disciplines is that each recognizes different sets of signs or different varieties of problems inherent in them, and it is in each case the simple recognition of such problems which justifies the search for their solution.</field>

We will use the definitions as they are provided in "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography," pp. 190-197, since in that essay all five divisions are included. Enumerative bibliography involves the "construction of lists of books and writings on various subjects." Historical bibliography "[enquires] into the evolution of printing (including typefounding and papermaking), binding, book ownership, and bookselling." Analytical bibliography is the "technical investigation of the printing of specific books, or of general printing practise, based exclusively on the physical evidence of the books themselves, not ignoring, however, what helpful correlation may be available with collateral evidence." Descriptive bibliography exists "to examine a book by all the methods of analytical bibliography in order to arrive at a total comprehension of the maximum physical facts as a preliminary to writing these up in set terms as a definitive physical description of the book, its external appearance, and the internal evidence bearing on the details of this external appearance." Textual bibliography is "the application of the evidence of analytical bibliography, or at least of its pertinent methods, to textual problems where meaning of some sort is involved. . . ." 5 Herman W.

Brit. , p. 588 and 590). For further objections to the term see Hibberd, p. 123, n. 3. 10 We must call this an "apparent" combination of the two branches since Francis does not state expressis verbis that he is including descriptive bibliography as defined by Bowers in his own definition of that term (which consists mainly of enumerative bibliography). Since, however, Francis makes such statements under his section on "Descriptive Bibliography" as "[elaborate] rules have been evolved for compiling such descriptions [of rare books], which make it possible for a skilled bibliographer to reconstruct from the text before him the make up and appearance of a book" (p. 979), and since he does not mention descriptive bibliography in Bowers' sense under his section on "Critical Bibliography," we may conclude that this is the case. It should be noted, however, that in the list of references at the end of the article (p. 981), Francis includes Bowers' Principles of Bibliographical Description under the heading of "Critical Bibliography." 11 Rudolf Blum, "Bibliographia: Eine wort- und begriffsgeschichtliche Untersuchung," Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens , 10 (1970), cols. 1153-1158. 12 Jean François Née de la Rochelle, "Discours sur la science bibliographique et sur les devoirs du bibliographe," in Bibliographie Instructive , X (Paris: Gogué &amp; Née de la Rochelle, 1782), xviii. 13 Blum, cols. 1115-1129.

See, for example, Wallace Kirsop, Bibliographie matérielle et critique textuelle: vers une collaboration , Biblio notes, 1 (Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1970). A corresponding effort has also recently been made in German by Martin Boghardt, Analytische Druckforschung: Ein methodischer Beitrag zu Buchkunde und Textkritik (Hamburg: Ernst Hauswedell, 1977). German scholarship is, moreover, as keenly aware today as it has always been of the values and requirements of historical bibliography. See, for example, Paul Raabe, "Was is Geschichte des Buchwesens: überlegungen zu einem Forschungsbereich und einer Bildungsaufgabe," Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel , Frankfurt Edition, 32, No. 38 (11 May 1976), B319-B330. 18 Blum, col. 1223, is an example of such criticism: "Bei aller Hochachtung von den bahnbrechenden Leistungen von Greg und seinen Kollegen kann man ihnen daher nicht den Vorwurf ersparen, dass sie auf die im übrigen Europa endlich erreichte Einengung des mehrdeutigen Terminus Bibliographie nicht die geringste Rücksicht genommen haben. . . . Was man jetzt in England critical bibliography nennt, ist für kontinentale Begriffe nicht Bibliographie, sondern Philologie." 19 Derek Williamson, Historical Bibliography (Hamden, Conn.: Archon Books, 1967), p. 109. 20 It is also true, however, that Hibberd himself does sometimes imply that he is simply substituting the term "reference bibliography" for "enumerative bibliography," and "physical bibliography" for "analytical bibliography," as on p. 125, n. 1, or in the following sentences on p. 133, n. 2: "Following his [Bowers in Ency. Brit. ] preliminary remarks, he devotes about two and a half of the remaining six and a half columns to an excellent summary of reference bibliography (which he calls enumerative or systematic bibliography ). In the Americana article, Verner Clapp, like Bowers, recognizes the basic division into systematic and analytic (i.e. reference and physical ) bibliography . . . ." Yet one should note that a central feature of Bowers' encyclopedia article is the division between enumerative bibliography and the constellation analytical/descriptive/textual bibliography. Hibberd (p. 128) has dispensed with this division, added "historical bibliography" from Bowers' earlier writings, and consolidated all five branches as sub-divisions or sub-phases under his term "physical bibliography." To equate Bowers' use of "analytical bibliography" with Hibberd's "physical bibliography" (or "enumerative" with "reference bibliography") is consequently impossible. 21 For arguments concerning this see H. Curtis Wright, "The Immateriality of Information," The Journal of Library History , 11 (1976), 297-315. 22 Saussure's major work (originally published posthumously in 1915) in his Cours de linguistique générale , ed.

For a more historical approach which views Peirce's philosophy rather as a succession of systems, see Murray G. Murphey, The Development of Peirce's Philosophy (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1961). 25 Later Peirce decided that there are not nine divisions of signs (three trichotomies) but rather sixty-six separate types. See Paul Weiss and Arthur Burks, "Peirce's Sixty-Six Signs," Journal of Philosophy , 42 (1945), 383-388. 26 Fredson Bowers, Bibliography and Textual Criticism (Oxford: Clarendon, 1964), p. 41. 27 It should be noted at once that there are, of course, from the standpoint of the analytical bibliographer, many other signs in a document (e.g. watermarks, format) than those supplied by or through the typography. Yet as Professor Bowers has remarked (in "Bibliography, Pure Bibliography," p. 192): "It is worth emphasis that this analytical method operates only on the physical evidence of the book, and generalizes from that. It is far from true, however, that a book with blank leaves would serve as well, except for the most elementary of analytical operations." 28 Bowers, "Function," p. 498. 29 From this point on the words "essential" or "essentially" will be used in this essay only in specific reference to those characteristics of an activity (with relation to its Object) which separate it from any other activity. 30 See, for example, Hibberd, p. 131, and Lancour, p. 495. 31 Edwin Eliott Willoughby, The Uses of Bibliography to the Students of Literature and History (Hamden, Conn.: Shoe String Press, 1957), p. 17. 32 Theodore Besterman, The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography , 2nd ed.

Hines' translation (see n. 13 above) of the first edition, revised, in which the identical sentence appears, reads: "The [bibliographical] lists printed since the 15th century, which today number in the tens of thousands, are lists of the names of works, printed in the same way as the works themselves" (p. 1). 34 Creativity in enumerative bibliography usually manifests itself—much as it does, say, in photography—in such matters as selection and perspective. Creativity in most scholarly disciplines (including analytical bibliography), on the other hand, normally involves the analysis of the Object rather than its duplication. As a result, the creative aspects of enumerative bibliography are invisible to many scholars, which is one reason why enumerative bibliographers seldom receive the recognition they deserve. 35 If annotations contain specific criticism of content, then obviously the result is not purely bibliographical but is rather a mixture of bibliography and criticism. The construction of such a work demands non-bibliographic skills. This is probably one reason which lies at the bottom of Malclès' distinction between "bibliographie de l'érudit" and "bibliographie du bibliographe" (in Cours de bibliographie [Geneva: E. Droz, 1954] pp. viii-x). 36 Philip Gaskell, "Photographic Reproduction versus Quasi-Facsimile Transcription," The Library , 5th ser., 7 (1952), 135-137. 37 It is also possible to produce fictitious bibliographies of works which never existed. See Willoughby, pp. 15-16. 38 Bowers, Ency. Brit. , p. 590; "Function," pp. 498-499. 39 This point of view seems to have gained wide acceptance chiefly as a result of the forceful arguments of W. W. Greg, especially in his "Bibliography—An Apologia," The Library , 4th ser., 13 (1932), 113-143.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Establishing Shakespeare's Text: Notes on Short Lines and the Problem of Verse Division by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Because of its abrupt break with regularity, the Shakespearean short line within a pentameter speech is immediately noticed by the ear and, in a reading edition, by the eye. Some problems are associated with these short internal lines, principally whether they are authoritative or the result of compositorial or scribal mislineation, or whether they may be part of a general mislineation that requires the isolation of some adjacent line of the text as the internal short line intended. Such internal lines, usually inserted for special rhetorical effects, are relatively few in comparison with Shakespeare's use of short lines in other and more varied circumstances. Thus they form no part of the present inquiry. Shakespeare uses short lines most frequently to divide a pentameter between two speakers. Next in order they may be used to end a speech but with no metrical link with the following speech, which begins with a full pentameter or with prose. Alone or in a series, single short lines without metrical relationship either to each other or to what precedes or follows may punctuate otherwise regular pentameter dialogue. Single short lines of what is presumably verse (but often subject only to arbitrary assignment as verse or as prose) may appear between prose speeches or between a verse and a prose speech. Least commonly, an unlinked metrically short line may begin a regular pentameter speech. Not one of these categories but presents a difficulty to an editor that in some manner may be connected with the basic problem of the linked, or divided, line in which a pentameter is split between two or more speakers. It is idle to comment that on a practical level many although not all problems would disappear if typographically the dialogue were edited as it appears in Renaissance printed editions, which in this respect follow the conventions of the dramatic manuscripts of the period. That is, the two or more parts of a verse divided between speakers are each printed flush with the left margin so that there is no visual linking of the parts to indicate the pentameter that they represent. Steevens was the first Shakespearean editor to indent the completing sections of divided lines so that the metrical structure was established and line reference was possible to the single verse. Despite the problems raised, the advantages of this indention are obvious. Without it, no line count for a play could be completed except on such a mechanical basis as in the new through-line-numbering system (TLN) employed by C. J. K. Hinman in his Norton facsimile of the First Folio. This arbitrary count of lines as printed in the Folio is invaluable for standard reference but it is useless for critical data since the vagaries of the Folio (and Quarto) compositors' treatment of the text offer no statistically valid count of the verse lines in a play insofar as these may be identified as units designed by Shakespeare. 1 Thus the 1793 system of indention has enabled editors to number verse lines in a critical instead of a mechanical manner, for with it one can distinguish independent separate short verses from those short lines that link to form an authentic pentameter. Critical line reference to metrical units can also be made exact by uniform editorial decision which specific short lines should link when alternative arrangements exist. Not to be ignored is the pleasure given a reader by the visual indication of the flow of the verse. 2 Finally, and sometimes a mixed blessing, on the basis of assumed short-line linkage between the end of one speech and the beginning of the next an editor may succumb to the temptation to reline the verse in order to secure what he takes to be the authorially intended arrangement that had been corrupted in the printing shop or in an antecedent scribal manuscript. Modern editors have devoted more attention to purifying the language of the plays by emendation (or de-emendation) than to a critical examination, with a view to mending its faults, of the actual workings of Steevens' metrical system. Comparison of the most esteemed twentieth-century editions of Shakespeare indicates that—transmitted through the basic Globe edition—Steevens' metrical distinctions, as marked by his choice of linked lines and his relining of the verse to secure certain linkages, have been generally accepted without the scrutiny that would have exposed inconsistencies and serious anomalies that demand editorial attention. Hence the modern effort to 'establish' Shakespeare's text has touched very little on the deficiencies of some parts of the traditional metrical arrangement. (Indeed, even the New Variorum may not record editorial variation in the linking of lines unless relineation is involved.) The failure of editorial curiosity to revise anomalies as well as positive errors is seemingly due to a lack of awareness that a problem exists, this intensified by the lack of any handy analysis of the metrical system that concerns short lines, whether or not part of a divided verse. It is a fact that there has been singularly little discussion of Shakespeare's metrics in recent years save at an aesthetic level that is of no practical assistance to a puzzled editor anxious to reproduce Shakespeare's intentions. Yet until the system of divided lines is fully investigated as a source of textual emendation 3 and the information applied to the necessary revision of standard texts, scholarship will be in no position to make a true start on a new edition that in any sense can begin to approach definitiveness. 4 It is essential to learn whether Shakespeare had certain favorite patterns, a recognition of which might solve at least the more obvious problems. The purpose of the present study is to make a start on the whole complex matter by distinguishing certain patterns and offering a few limited answers, limited at least as applied to the solution of the most acute problems. That there are problems may be illustrated by the following examples from Measure for Measure : Isabella . None, but such remedie, as to save a head To cleave a heart in twaine. Claudio . But is there anie? Isabella . Yes brother, you may live; There is a divellish mercie in the Judge, If you'l implore it, that will free your life (TLN 1271-76); Ile pray a thousand praiers for thy death, No word to save thee. Claudio . Nay heare me Isabell . Isabella . Oh fie, fie, fie: Thy sinn's not accidentall, but a Trade (1367-71); The weariest, and most loathed worldly life That Age, Ache, perjury, and imprisonment Can lay on nature, is a Paradise To what we feare of death. Isabella . Alas, alas. Claudio . Sweet Sister, let me live. What sinne you do, to save a brothers life, Nature dispenses with the deede so farre (TLN 1348-54); . . . . This night's the time That I should do what I abhorre to name, Or else thou diest to morrow. Claudio . Thou shalt not do't. Isabella . O, were it but my life, I'de throw it downe for your deliverance (TLN 1317-22). The above quotations, drawn from the Folio, have been given the Globe's indention and system of lining, one that has been followed by all the recent editors I have looked into from the Globe to the Riverside. In the first, Claudio's short line has been linked with the last line of Isabella's speech instead of with the first line of her next speech. But in the same scene the procedure is reversed in the second and third quotations. Here the Globe and other editors have instead linked the short speech with the opening line of the next speech. Yet there is more inconsistency. For example, not many lines earlier the Globe in the fourth illustration indents Claudio's short speech to link it with the preceding speech, in the process creating a semi-run-on beginning line for Isabella. No discernible principle seems to have dictated why in two cases editors have linked the short separate speech with the preceding speech and in the other two with the beginning short line of the next when either way is metrically equivalent. We shall see that in fact only in the second and third quotations is the verse correctly divided by modern editors. Before one can understand the conditions under which Shakespeare would link certain short lines but not others, one must trace the patterns of unlinked verse lines of less than pentameter length. The three major categories are (1) unlinked part lines ending a speech, (2) unlinked part lines beginning a speech, and (3) unlinked independent short lines that are themselves a complete brief speech. Non-linking short lines concluding a speech occur in two major situations depending upon whether it is or is not theoretically possible for them to be completed by the short line of the next speech. Unquestioned short lines that cannot be completed are most frequently found ending a speech before a speech that begins with a full pentameter: Know, Cœsar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Metellus . Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne ( JC 1254-56). They also appear ending a verse speech before prose: Anthony . The businesse she hath broached in the State, Cannot endure my absence. Enobarbus . And the businesse you have broach'd heere cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra's . . . ( Ant. 270-273). Shakespeare may utilize the special effect of a short line to lend naturalness to a scene ending: You must to Parthia, your Commissions ready: Follow me, and recive't Exeunt. ( Ant. 1009-10) The incidence of these short concluding lines rises with the years, although erratically. The Two Gentlemen of Verona has about seven, 5 of which one is an exit line; the Dream (Shakespeare's most regular play) has only one; Romeo and Juliet has thirteen, of which five are exit lines and one before prose; The Merchant of Venice ten; As You Like It fourteen; Much Ado eleven; Twelfth Night fourteen (five before prose); Julius Cœsar thirty-one (three as exit lines and two before prose); Measure for Measure about forty-two (seven before prose); All's Well twenty-two; Antony and Cleopatra about sixty; Coriolanus about forty-seven; Winter's Tale about twenty-five; Cymbeline about twenty-eight; Tempest about twenty-nine. Unlinked short lines beginning a pentameter speech are much rarer. (Ben Jonson, incidentally, declined to write them.) In situations where no possibility exists that they could complete a preceding line, they appear after the full pentameter line of a preceding speech: This way will I: Disrobe the Images, If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies. Marullus . May we do so? You know it is the Feast of Lupercall ( JC 72-75). They may also occur after a prose speech: Agrippa . There she appear'd indeed: or my reporter devis'd well for her. Enobarbus . I will tell you, The Barge she sat in, like a burnisht Throne Burnt on the water: the Poope was beaten Gold ( Ant. 899-903). They may also be used for their special effect as an entrance line, especially at the start of a scene: Brutus . What Lucius , hoe? I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres, Give guesse how neere to day— Lucius , I say? ( JC 616-618). The following figures are only approximate because of the difficulties in distinction, but again the incidence of beginning unlinked short lines has a general tendency to rise. The Two Gentlemen of Verona has about eight, curiously enough; the Dream none; Romeo and Juliet three; Merchant of Venice about three; As You Like It perhaps two; Much Ado probably none; Twelfth Night about three; Julius Cœsar about five; Measure for Measure about seven; All's Well about seven; Antony and Cleopatra about twelve; Coriolanus about thirty-seven; Winter's Tale about twelve; Cymbeline about thirteen; Tempest perhaps five or six. These statistics showing the general prevalence of independent short lines ending speeches but the relative rarity of unlinked short beginning lines carry over, significantly, into another situation—that in which an independent part-line separate speech either completes a pentameter begun by the short ending of the preceding speech, or else begins a pentameter completed by the short opening of the next speech. Short line completes a pentameter To undergoe such ample grace, and honour, It is Lord Angelo . Enter Angelo. Duke . Looke where he comes. ( MM 26-29); Short line begins a pentameter Isabella . Oh, let him marry her. Lucio . This is the point. The Duke is very strangely gone from hence ( MM 400-402); Passage with both Bin lesse, and so more equall ballasting To thee Posthumus . Belarius . He wrings at some distresse. Guiderius . Would I could free't. Arviragus . Or I, what ere it be, What paine it cost, what danger: Gods! Belarius . Hearke Boyes. ( Cymb. 2171-77) Even in these circumstances of linked speeches, the preponderance of short ending versus short beginning lines is marked. For instance, in The Tempest there are fifty-two such ending versus seven such beginning linked lines; in Cymbeline as many as seventy-three short ending lines completed by an independent part-line speech as against only eight short linked beginnings; in Coriolanus the figures are eighty-three as against sixteen. Once more the statistics are five or more to one that when linking part lines are present Shakespeare will end a speech with a short line than that he will begin a speech with less than a full pentameter. Indeed, the only frequent use of part beginning lines is this linkage (more and more often as time passes) with short endings to induce a flexible and varied flow of pentameter dialogue verse. The division of a pentameter between two multi-line speeches grows on Shakespeare remarkably. An exact count for any play is impossible to make in the present stage of our knowledge, since it may often be a matter of opinion whether two short lines are independent or were intended to join to form a pentameter. A rough count shows something like this (the figures in parentheses are the through-line-number counts, less epilogues, as found in Hinman): Dream (2152) about 35 or fewer; Merchant (2738) about 80 or fewer; Romeo and Juliet (3185) about 80; Julius Cœsar (2730) about 125; Much Ado (2684) about 35; As You Like It (2775) about 35; Twelfth Night (2558) about 42; All's Well (3072) about 135; Measure for Mesaure (2938) about 150; Antony and Cleopatra (3636) somewhere between 440 and 460; Coriolanus (3838) about 390; Winter's Tale (3369) about 335; Cymbeline (3819) about 400; Tempest (2319) about 220. Before Edward II with its 29 divided pentameters, Marlowe's mighty line admitted practically no divided verses in texts that can be authenticated. 6 Similarly, as Shakespeare's verse increased in flexibility the number of divided verses expanded. For example, in the 83 verse lines of Cymbeline I.i—an expository dialogue between two gentlemen—there are 10 divided pentameters, 2 independent short lines, and 71 regular verses. More to the point, the 10 divided verses appear in 19 speeches, which means that except for a separate short-line speech at I.i.62 (Globe), TLN 72, each speech ends with a part line completed by the opening part line of the next speech. (The second separate short line is at the exeunt.) The second scene contains 178 lines and 39 speeches, linked by some 27 divided pentameters. Only six speeches in this scene are not linked: of these, five (including the exeunt speech) end with a full pentameter and one with a trimeter. No independent short lines appear. These first two scenes, therefore, totalling 261 verses, contain as many divided lines as occur in the entire play in The Two Gentlemen of Verona , or Much Ado , or As You Like It . Since the same distinction of early and late holds in the tragedies, it seems clear that starting about the time of the so-called problem plays this feature of Shakespeare's dramatic blank verse began to expand rapidly. By the last plays it had doubled in frequency from the problem plays and was close to ten times the frequency of the early comedies. As one would expect, accompanying the rise in this incidence of division is a rise in the number of irregular divided lines either in the sense that they are deficient or hypermetrical (and thus perhaps intended not as linked but as separate lines), or else in the sense that choices exist as to which two short lines were intended for linking and which third was to remain independent as in the illustrations from Measure for Measure above. The Dream has not a single such problem within its complete metrical regularity. The Two Gentlemen has about five possible metrical linking irregularities or questions of association in division, Twelfth Night about eight, but Measure for Measure close to thirty, Coriolanus about twenty. Cymbeline is unusual in posing no more than about fifteen possible difficulties, but Antony and Cleopatra (the metrically most irregular of Shakespeare's plays) is equally unusual in offering more than forty-five. Outside of a few specific exceptions, no reason exists why in most circumstances the statistics about the incidence of short lines in the two different positions should not suggest the principle by which the usual problems may be resolved. This is, whenever a choice exists as to which two short lines should form a pentameter and which third should stand by itself, the odds strongly favor the principle that in ordinary circumstances a short line beginning a speech should be linked in preference to the short ending line of a speech. The general pattern of Shakespeare's versification indicates that unlinked final short lines are common whereas unlinked short beginning lines are rare and usually recognizable as inserted for special purposes. This general pattern observable in situations where no choice exists can be applied with confidence to the selection of the short lines to link when a metrical option is present. If so, then instead of the traditional arrangement of the first example from Measure for Measure given above as To cleave a heart in twaine. Claudio . But is there anie? Isabella . Yes brother, you may live; the correct division should be Claudio . But is there anie? Isabella . Yes brother, you may live. Correspondingly, instead of Or else thou diest to morrow. Claudio . Thou shalt not do't. Isabella . O, were it but my life, I'de throw it downe for your deliverance the correct division should be Claudio . Thou shalt not do't. Isabella . O, were it but my life, . . . Editors are also at fault in another option: To love the Moor. Roderigo . I would not follow him then. Iago . O, sir, content you; I follow him to serve my turn upon him (I.i.40-42) whereas the division should be: Rodorigo . I would not follow him then. Iago . O Sir content you ( Oth. 44-45). Because of the great predominance of short closing over short opening lines in dialogue where no linkage is in question, the burden of proof may be said to fall on an editor who associates an intervening short line with the preceding part line closing a speech instead of the following part line beginning a speech, as in the illustration above from Othello . On the other hand, Shakespeare does use a small number of short opening lines in unlinked dialogue and it is worth surveying these to see if they have any special identifying characteristics as against the purely random (except for occasional exit speeches) use of short closing lines. Analysis discloses that the majority indeed shows a pattern indicating a structural or rhetorical purpose. For example, the break may be syntactical as in Marullus . May we do so? You know it is the Feast of Lupercall ( JC 74-75); Themselves, when they be felt. Messenger . I have done my duty. Cleopatra . Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser then I do ( Ant. 1136-39). Intervening stage-business may justify a short line: Messenger . Good Madam patience. Cleopatra . What say you? Strikes him . Hence horrible Villaine, or Ile spurne thine eyes ( Ant. 1103-5). In the next illustration a change of address (from command to soliloquy) fortifies the call to Lucius: Brutus . What Lucius , hoe? I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres, Give guesse how neere to day— Lucius , I say? ( JC 616-618) Valentine . Will you make haste? Exit. Proteus . I will. Even as one heate, another heate expels, Or as one naile, by strength drives out another. So the remembrance of my former Love ( TGV 845-849); Jessica . Farewell good Lancelet . [ Exit Lancelet.] Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe ( MV 786-788). Common are changes of address from one character to another: Queene . Dispatch. Exit Ladies. Now Maister Doctor, have you brought those drugges? ( Cymb. 494-495); I am Marble constant: now the fleeting Moone No Planet is of mine. Enter Guardsman, and Clowne . Guardsman . This is the man. Cleopatra . Avoid, and leave him. Exit Guardsman . Hast thou the pretty worme of Nylus there ( Ant. 3490-95); Lartius . Thou worthiest Martius , [ To Titus] Go sound thy Trumpet in the Market place ( Cor. 599-600). Whatever the situation, almost invariably some distinct syntactical pause, some break, with or without stage-business or change of address, is made after the opening short line: Imogen . Nay, stay a little: Were you but riding forth to ayre your selfe ( Cymb. 129-130); Benvolio . Part Fooles, Put up your Swords, you know not what you do ( Rom. 61); Camillo . My Lord, Goe then; and with a countenance as cleare ( WT 443-444); Lepidus . Noble Friends: That which combin'd us was most great, and let not ( Ant. 701-702); Coriolanus . Choller? Were I as patient as the midnight sleep ( Cor. 1777); Isabella . Why, 7 As all comforts are: most good, most good indeede ( MM 1263-64). The urgency of the special effect that Shakespeare sought from the opening short line of a speech leads him, on rare occasions, into the unusual metrical pattern whereby normally unlinkable short lines end and begin two successive speeches: And prayes you to beleeve him. Duke . 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus: Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne? ( Oth. 373-375) Then violent'st Contrariety. Enter Messenger . Messenger . You are sent for to the Senate: A fearefull Army, led by Caius Martius ( Cor. 2985-88). The first comes under the head of change of address, which frequently calls for a short line, but the second is purely rhetorical. In contrast, the short unlinked beginning of a speech without a special purpose is so rare that many plays have none, and perhaps no more than one or two can be found legitimately in any single play among the rest. Jacques . Why who cries out on pride, That can therein taxe any private party ( AYL 1044-45); Menenius . Either you must Confesse your selves wondrous Malicious ( Cor. 88-89); Duke . There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion ( TN 980-981); Imogen . Great men That had a Court no bigger then this Cave ( Cymb. 2178-79). 8 These patternless examples of run-on lines may be due as much to carelessness as to anything; no principle is involved and they are so extremely uncommon as to constitute sports that can have no evidential value in attacking the problem of divided short beginnings except to discourage any attempt by an editor to imitate them in his arrangements. 9 On the other hand, the special uses that Shakespeare makes of independent opening part lines undoubtedly have an intimate connection with problems of linking, and their evidence must be heeded. 10 Unfortunately, Shakespeare does not restrict these special effects to short lines alone; indeed, the number of full pentameters containing in their first half commands, exclamations, changes of address, stage-business, and the like vastly outnumber the times that Shakespeare chooses to emphasize the same material by an isolated part line. One may open almost any play at random and come on such examples as these: Trebonius . Cœsar I will: [ aside ] and so neere will I be, That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further. ( JC 1123-24); Cœsar . Are we all ready? What is now amisse, That Cœsar and his Senate must redresse? ( JC 1237-38); Cassius . Stoop then, and wash. How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted over ( JC 1326-27); Antony . He shall not live; looke, with a spot I dam him ( JC 1860); Menenius . Consider this: He ha's bin bred i'th' Warres ( Cor. 2062). Of even greater pertinence, the rather uncommon cases of abrupt short beginning lines emphasized by being set off as unitary single lines are also notably outnumbered by the frequency with which Shakespeare links just such lines with the ending of the preceding speech; or, just as commonly, and substantially the same thing, links them with a preceding short single speech: 2. Messenger . He stayes upon your will. Anthony . Let him appeare: These strong Egyptian Fetters I must breake, Or loose my selfe in dotage. ( Ant. 207-210); 11 And know how we proceede. Aufidius . Is it not yours? What ever have bin thought one in this State ( Cor. 316-318); And not my Husbands Secrets? Brutus . O ye Gods! Render me worthy of this Noble Wife. ( JC 944-946); There lies your way, due West. Viola . Then Westward hoe: Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship ( TN 1349-51); Your Provost knowes the place where he abides, And he may fetch him. Duke . Goe, doe it instantly: And you, my noble and well-warranted Cosen ( MM 2629-32); Silvius . Phebe , with all my heart. Phebe . Ile write it strait: The matter's in my head, and in my heart ( AYL 1910-12). These special-purpose short beginning lines, then, are so frequently linked as by no means always (or even usually) to require treatment as a separate verse. Yet even so, the independent ones offer the best evidence we have to assist an editor when problems of arrangement arise. For instance, if in two multi-verse speeches Shakespeare for a special purpose may (infrequently) end one speech with a short line and begin the next speech with an unlinked short line too, 12 then it stands to reason that on a few of the occasions when such lines could be metrically linked it is theoretically possible that Shakespeare might have intended them to stand as separate verses even though beginning a speech. Two examples may be cited where the meter encourages, if not enforces, one particular linking as against another possibility. The first is correctly lined by all editors: Each drop she falls, would prove a Crocodile: Out of my sight. Desdemona . I will not stay to offend you. Lodovic . Truely [an (Q)] obedient Lady: I do beseech your Lordship call her backe. ( Oth. 2641-45) Inconsistently, in the next example, the Globe and other editors insist on an arrangement that creates a hexameter: [ Globe and editors ] To have him see me woman'd. Bianca . Why, I pray you? Cassio . Not that I love you not. Bianca . But that you do not love me. I pray you, bring me on the way a little. (III.iv.195-197) The passage should be rearranged as: To have him see me woman'd. Bianca . Why, I pray you? Cassio . Not that I love you not. Bianca . But that you do not love me. I pray you bring me on the way a little ( Oth. 2359-63). The abrupt rhetorical switch between Bianca's ironic response to Cassio's reluctance and her new proposal for him to accompany her justifies the short line beginning a speech, especially when it releases the verse from an unnecessary hexameter. However, situations do arise where metrically a free option exists to link a separate short speech either with the preceding or the following short line. The easiest cases to identify and to avoid are those that would produce a short beginning line without any special purpose. The failure to apply this test of significant purpose leads the Globe and its trail of captive editors into the frequent violation of Shakespeare's clearest-cut patterns. [ Globe and editors ] Below the beam of sight, yet will I still Be thus to them. A Patrician . You do the nobler. Coriolanus . I muse my mother Does not approve me further . . . . This must be wrong, for 'I muse my mother' is a natural linking line not a rhetorically motivated independent one. Nobleman . You do the Nobler. Coriolanus . I muse my Mother Do's not approve me further, who was wont ( Cor. 2091-93). This forms a pentameter with the suppression of a stressed syllable at the caesura, a form of line occasionally met with in Shakespeare's regular verse (see below). On the contrary, editors almost wilfully have adopted an arrangement that has two defects: first, in order to link 'Be thus to them' with 'You do the nobler', they must suppress a complete iamb at the caesura, a possibility not certainly allowable, and definitely not one to venture on if a suitable alternative is present. Second, after this difficulty the run-on line 'I muse my mother' is then assigned as a complete verse, although this is contrary to Shakespeare's normal patterned use of such lines, as we have seen. Correspondingly, in the next example, only Alexander arranges the passage correctly, involving the caesural suppression of an accented syllable, whereas the Globe, Kittredge, New Arden, Pelican, and Riverside create a short beginning with a run-on line of a sort which must be avoided: [ Globe and editors ] Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek So much as lank'd not. Lepidus . 'Tis pity of him. Cœsar . Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain (I.iii.70-73); [ Alexander—correct ] Was borne so like a Souldiour, that thy cheeke So much as lank'd not. Lepidus . 'Tis pitty of him. Cœsar . Let his shames quickely Drive him to Rome, 'tis time we twaine ( Ant. 506-510) A more extended example of the Globe and other editors' mistaken arrangement in Antony and Cleopatra comes in Act II, scene vii. [ Folio ] But must condemne it now: desist, and drinke. Menas . For this, Ile never follow Thy paul'd Fortunes more, . . . Anthony . It ripen's towards it: strike the Vessells hoa. Heere's to Cœsar . Cœsar . I could well forbear't, it's monstrous labour when I wash my braine, and it grow[s] fouler. Anthony . Be a Child o'th' time. Cœsar . Possesse it, Ile make answer: but I had rather fast from all, foure dayes, then drinke so much in one. Enobarbus . Ha my brave Emperour, shall we daunce now the Egyptian Backenals, and celebrate our drinke? Pompey . Let's ha't good Souldier. Anthony . Come, let's all take hands, Till that the conquering Wine hath steep't our sense, In soft and delicate Lethe. Enobarbus . All take hands: ( Ant. 1426-59); [ Globe to Riverside ] But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink. Menas . [ Aside ] For this, I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more. . . . Antony . It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho! Here is to Cæsar! Cœsar . I could well forbear 't. It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain, And it grows fouler. Antony . Be a child o' the time. Cœsar . Possess it, I'll make answer: But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one. Enobarbus . Ha, my brave emperour! [ To Antony . Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals, And celebrate our drink? Pompey . Let's ha't, good soldier. Antony . Come, let's all take hands, Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense In soft and delicate Lethe. Enobarbus . All take hands. (II.vii.87-114) In the Folio Menas' speech is clearly mislined, but we are now able to recognize this for what it is, not a mistaken extension of a short line but instead Compositor B's frequent habit of breaking in two a pentameter that was too long for his measure. The two part-lines in the Folio may be joined to form an acceptable verse, whereas the Globe's relining to create a short opening verse 'For this' has little justification from Shakespeare's customary use of such short openers for special effects. All one need do is to pronounce 'never' as nere and one has a pentameter composed of an iamb, an anapest, and three iambs. The Globe's decision that 'Be a child o' the time' should complete Cæsar's speech makes Cæsar's 'I could well forbear 't' a short beginning line. There is something of a rhetorical break after 'I'll make answer' but not a sufficiently sharp one to enforce an independent short line to mark the shift. The Globe's division 'fouler. | Be a child' gives a mechanically regular line of iambs with a probable concluding anapest; but the lyric caesura forces an unnatural stress on 'Be' as the second syllable of an iamb, whereas if, instead, a divided verse begins with Antony's advice, then 'Be a child' may be given the more natural anapestic stress. With complete certainty one can insist that 'Come, let's all take hands' has no justification as a separate verse 13 and with some confidence arrange it to complete a pentameter with Pompey's 'Let's ha't, good soldier.' [ Suggested lining ] Menas . For this, Ile never follow thy paul'd Fortunes more, . . . . . . . . . . . . . And it grow[s] fouler. Anthony . Be a Child o'th' time. Cœsar . Possesse it, Ile make answer: . . . . . . . . . . . . . And celebrate our drinke? Pompey . Let's ha't good Souldier. Anthony . Come, let's all take hands . . . . In contrast, even though the metrical options permit either arrangement so that a short beginning line is not obligatory, some situations might be thought to call for a venturesome editor to suppress the odds that so strongly favor the completion of a divided verse by the opening part-line of a speech. Required (not imaginary) stage-business involving the use of properties that calls for a real pause while action develops may lead Shakespeare to begin a speech with a short line, as in the following example, where there is no option to the arrangement: Julia . Madam, please you peruse this Letter; Pardon me (Madam) I have unadvis'd Deliver'd you a paper that I should not ( TGV 1940-42). In the next example, somewhat later in the same play, either the first and second or the second and third short lines may link with equal metrical regularity, and the conservative position would of course be that the divided verse should read 'Heere 'tis: . . . | How? let me see.' But the stage-business of handing over the ring and Proteus' examination of it could be thought to justify the emphasis of his short line as a complete verse in the traditional arrangement: Proteus . Where is that ring? boy? Julia . Heere 'tis: this is it. Proteus . How? let me see. Why this is the ring I gave to Julia ( TGV 2214-17). When such technical matters affect the arrangement, an editor might feel free to adjust the indention, in case of metrical ambiguity, to what are demonstrably Shakespearean patterns. With just the same situation, except that it involves the less compelling pattern of a change of address, the Globe and editors opt for the conservative position in As You Like It , 2313-17: Celia . There is more in it; Cosen Ganimed . Oliver . Looke, he recovers. Rosalind . I would I were at home. Celia . Wee'll lead you thither: I pray you will you take him by the arme. Editors are doubtless correct in this arrangement although a lining is possible that takes account of the change of address: Oliver . Looke, he recovers. Rosalind . I would I were at home. Celia . We'll lead you thither. 14 Traditional arrangements (which produce an excessive number of unpatterned short opening lines) are likely to show serious inconsistencies when the separate short opening verse might be created more for rhetorical reasons than to mark a structural pause such as the issue of commands at exits, a marked change of address, or the intervention of stage-business. Tradition may sentimentally support the emphatic short line in Antony's farewell speech, and there is a possible change of address for a moment to encourage such arrangement despite the metrical option that would conservatively suggest that 'I am dying' should be linked with 'a heavy sight.' Quicken with kissing: had my lippes that power, Thus would I weare them out. All . A heavy sight. Anthony . I am dying Egypt, dying. 15 In the next quotation the Folio lining is by no means impeccable, but there would seem to be no reason for the Globe and other editors to ignore what hints it may offer and for them to reline the Folio to produce a short ending rather than a short beginning line, when the beginning is tolerably emphatic: [ Folio ] Menenius . Nay I heare nothing: His Mother and his wife, heare nothing from him. ( Cor. 2912-13) [ Globe to Riverside ] Menenius . Nay, I heare nothing: his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him. (IV.vi.18-19) 16 Of course, if the Folio had been lined like the Globe, it need not have been changed to produce an independent short line. Similarly, in the next example there is even less reason to reline and in the process to create a divided hexameter when Menenius' exclamation makes a more than acceptable short line by itself, even at the cost of ending and beginning adjacent speeches with unlinked short lines. Examples have been provided above (as in Oth. 373-375 and Cor. 2985-88) of clearcut Shakespearean occurrences of this unusual pattern. [ Folio ] . . . He said, 'twas folly For one poore graine or two, to leave unburnt And still to nose th'offence. Menenius . For one poore graine or two? I am one of those: his Mother, Wife, his Childe ( Cor. 3179-83); [ Globe to Riverside ] And still to nose the offence. Menenius . For one poor grain or two! (V.i.28) For a rhetorical situation like this, the Folio's two short lines are by no means so anomalous as to require indention to form a hexameter. In the next illustration, from Cymbeline , Iachimo brings Posthumus letters from Britain: [ Folio, arranged ] And be false with them. Iachimo . Heere are Letters for you. Posthumus . Their tenure good I trust. Iachimo . 'Tis very like. Posthumus . Was Caius Lucius in the Britaine Court, When you were there? Iachimo . He was expected then, But not approach'd. Posthumus . All is well yet, Sparkles this Stone as it was wont, or is't not Too dull for your good wearing? ( Cymb. 1183-93) [ Globe to Riverside ] Posthumus . Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were there? Iachimo . He was expected then, But not approach'd. Posthumus . All is well yet. (II.iv.35-39). This represents unexceptionable division up to the last, but the price of a linked tetrameter, or of a doubtful pentameter with the caesura substituting for a whole foot, is too high to pay merely to force 'All is well yet' into a divided verse. This 'All is well yet' has no relation to the dialogue but refers to something in the letter that Posthumus has been reading as he inquires about the court with half his mind; hence it is appropriate for it to stand alone, unlinked, the divided pentameters resuming when he dismisses the business in the letter and starts his dialogue with Iachimo about their wager of the ring on Imogen's constancy. Given the metrical problem and what amounts to a change of address, it may seem that editors have no more right to form a divided tetrameter here than a divided hexameter in Coriolanus V.i.28, above. Except that the change of address is wanting (although there is a rhetorical shift), the same may be true of (The Breeze upon her) like a Cow in June, Hoists Sailes, and flyes. Enobarbus . That I beheld: Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not ( Ant. 1993-96). Granting all the independent emphasis of 'That I beheld', it may be an open question whether it is enough to justify a linked tetrameter (or a whole missing foot at the caesura in a linked pentameter) as traditionally arranged, or whether the thrust of 'That I beheld' is not accentuated if a short line follows a short line and the pentameters start again with 'Mine eyes did sicken'. When very special reasons for a separate short opening line are wanting, however, an editor will play the odds by following the common pattern of a short ending line followed by a divided pentameter composed in its first half of a brief separate speech and in its second half either of another brief separate speech or else the opening part line of a longer speech. The following illustration, from Cymbeline , where no options are present, shows that rhetorical pauses alone are far from enough to enforce short emphatic separate lines. I hope it be not gone, to tell my Lord That I kisse aught but he. Pisanio . 'Twill not be lost. Imogen . I hope so: go and search. Cloten . You have abus'd me: His meanest Garment? Imogen . I, I said so Sir, If you will make't an Action, call witnesse to't. Cloten . I will enforme your Father. Imogen . Your Mother too: She's my good Lady; and will concieve, I hope But the worst of me. So I leave you[] Sir, To'th' worst of discontent. Exit . Cloten . Ile be reveng'd: His mean'st Garment? Well. Exit . (1127-41) One should note that such rhetorical examples as 'You have abus'd me', and 'I, I said so Sir', and 'Your Mother too', but especially 'Ile be reveng'd', could be thought to raise the question of separate short beginning lines if found in a situation where an option existed in the arrangement. But Shakespeare links them here, and we may take the suggestion that rhetorical breaks alone should be viewed with caution as offering ground for an arrangement of divided verse that would isolate short beginning lines as single units. When editors attempt to decide between such options on impressionistic grounds, inconsistency is inevitable. For example, in the following illustration from Othello Rodorigo . Most reverend Signior, do you know my voice? Brabantio . Not I: what are you? Rodorigo . My name is Rodorigo . Brabantio . The worsser welcome: I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores ( Oth. 102-106) most editors arrange as above with the short beginning of Brabantio's speech properly completing a pentameter; but in contrast the New Penguin divides the two short lines 'Not I . . .' and 'My name is Rodorigo ', thus attempting a false rhetorical emphasis by isolating Brabantio's 'The worsser welcome' as a short beginning. In the next two illustrations from Othello all editors agree with the Globe in inconsistent arrangements: And many a civill Monster. Othello . Did he confesse it? Iago . Good Sir, be a man: Thinke every bearded fellow that's but yoak'd (2444-47); To love the Moore ? Rodorigo . I would not follow him then. Iago . O Sir content you. I follow him, to serve my turne upon him. (43-46) It is difficult to distinguish any substantive rhetorical difference between 'Good Sir, be a man' and 'O Sir content you' that in the one case calls for linking but in the second has superior claims to separation as a single line against all the statistics for Shakespeare's pattern and the examples quoted above from Cymbeline . It would seem clear that the normal and preferred lining should be: Rodorigo . I would not follow him then. Iago . O Sir content you. just as in As You Like It the Globe and other editors agree that, despite the vocative, 'O unhappie youth' should be linked: Oh what a world is this, when what is comely Envenoms him that beares it? [ Orlando .] Why, what's the matter? Adam . O unhappie youth, Come not within these doores: within this roofe (717-721). A problem in division may arise when two part-lines that seem as if they should be linked do not produce a regular pentameter when joined, either because of a deficiency or else a surplus of syllables or of stresses. Deficiency is the more common pattern: it occurs frequently enough, in fact, to suggest with some force that Shakespeare's intention in certain specific patterns was nevertheless to link the two part-lines and not to have them stand as an independent pair. 17 In the most common pattern two part-lines would form a regular pentameter provided the caesural pause—coming after a stressed syllable—were given an unstressed syllabic value forming the first part of the post-caesural iambic foot, what Jacob Schipper calls "The suppression of the anacrusis." 18 The effect in the second half of the line is identical with that in the first half of a full pentameter line that begins without the unstressed syllable of its first iamb, an acceptable metrical device. The syntactical emphasis that such a metrical break provides is perhaps more obvious in divided than in undivided verse, but a special rhetorical effect can be produced in a full pentameter, as in Duke . Proceed, proceed: wee'l begin these rights, As we do trust, they'l end in true delights ( AYL 2774-75) That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Under my Battlements. Come you Spirits ( Mac. 390-391). On the example of such lines as these, it may readily be taken that Shakespeare intended two part-lines to be linked when the caesural pause between them could substitute for a missing unstressed syllable. Or Night kept chain'd below. Prospero . Fairely spoke; Sit then, and talke with her, she is thine owne ( Temp. 1684-86); Then in my thought it lies. Diana . Good my Lord, Aske him about his oath, if hee do's thinke ( AWW 2905-7) The thankings of a King. Posthumus . I am Sir The Souldier that did company these three ( Cymb. 3730-32); You did mistake. Leonates . No: if I mistake In those Foundations which I build upon ( WT 705-707); Be strew'd before your feete. Anthony . Let us go. Come: Our separation so abides and flies ( Ant. 422-424). Or possibly: Anthony . Let us go. Come: Our separation so abides and flies . . . . A second kind of metrically deficient line is more troublesome. The normal complement of five stresses is not found in this variety: instead, the verse contains only four stresses although arranged in a significant syllabic pattern that distinguishes the line from a normal tetrameter. In this form of divided line, the caesura follows a weak or unstressed syllable. One can think of this as a line with a lyric caesura in which the caesura substitutes for the immediately following stressed syllable. The pattern exhibits what Schipper calls the suppression of the arsis. So Honor crosse it from the North to South, And let them grapple: The blood more stirres To rowze a Lyon, then to start a Hare ( 1H4 520-522); Prince . For Wormes, brave Percy . Farewell great heart ( 1H4 3052); [ divided ] Laugh at his Challenge. Mecenas . Cœsar must thinke, When one so great begins to rage, hee's hunted ( Ant. 2396-98). Although it has been suggested that 'monst(e)rous' should be the pronunciation to make the line regular, it is more probable that we have below the special sort of line under discussion: 'Tis monstrous: Iago , who began't? ( Oth. 1337). 19 Despite examples such as these from Shakespeare's full pentameter verse, an editor might still feel uneasy about attempting to link two separate short lines that joined would create a verse with this pattern. But an interesting repetition of the pattern in divided verse in The Merchant of Venice demonstrates that Shakespeare deliberately introduced it for variety: Lorenzo . The moone shines bright. In such a night as this, . . . Where Cressed lay that night. Jessica . In such a night Did Thisbie fearefully ore-trip the dewe, And saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe, And ranne dismayed away. Lorenzo . In such a night Stood Dido with a Willow in her hand Upon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Love To come againe to Carthage. Jessica . In such a night Medea gathered the inchanted hearbs That did renew old Eson . Lorenzo . In such a night Did Jessica steale from the wealthy Jewe, And with an Unthrift Love did runne from Venice, As farre as Belmont. Jessica . In such a night Did young Lorenzo sweare he lov'd her well, Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith, And nere a true one. Lorenzo . In such a night Did pretty Jessica (like a little shrow) Slander her Love, and he forgave it her. ( MV 2404, 2410-32) The symmetry here is worth examining since it can only be designed. The first two occurrences of divided lines with 'In such a night' have regular caesuras and ten-syllable verse (TLN 2410-11, 2414-15); the next two have epic caesuras, i.e. the first half with a feminine ending (TLN 2418-19, 2421-22); and the last two exhibit the line in which the caesura must substitute for a stressed syllable (TLN 2425-26, 2429-30). That this passage legitimizes linkage in such a pattern of the suppression of the arsis can scarcely be doubted, particularly when it is considered that 'In such a night' has no qualifications to be segregated as an independent short line beginning a speech. The caesural elision of an unstressed or even a stressed syllable is of course not confined to dividing the closing and opening lines of two speeches but also affects the linking of short single lines that might otherwise be viewed as independent. An example of each may be drawn from Cymbeline : I have not slept one winke. Imogen . Doo't, and to bed then. Pisanio . Ile wake mine eye-balles first. Imogen . Wherefore then Didd'st undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd (1775-79); Dispayring, dyed. Cymbeline . Heard you all this, her Women? Ladies . We did, so please your Highnesse. Cymbeline . Mine eyes Were not in fault, for she was beautifull (3321-25). The legitimacy of this division cannot be challenged, for under no circumstances could 'Wherefore then' or 'Mine eyes' be acceptable as an independent short line beginning a speech. Whether two short lines should be independent or metrically linked can be decided as much on the basis of this elided syllable pattern at the caesura as if they formed a regular ten-syllable pentameter. Silvia . That you are welcome? Proteus . That you are worthlesse. ( TGV 765-766) But since Shakespeare could link some short lines in a series and others not, 20 it is a helpful determinant in the above that the preceding and following speeches for some lines have been full pentameters. Nevertheless, restraint is needed when an editor chooses to reline acceptable verse in order to produce these special lines. For example, in Two Gentlemen the Folio prints TLN 1891-97 as follows: Julia . It seemes you lov'd not her, not leave her token: She is dead belike? Proteus . Not so: I thinke she lives. Julia . Alas. Proteus . Why do'st thou cry alas? Julia . I cannot choose but pitty her. Proteus . Wherefore should'st thou pitty her? after which pentameters resume. Lines 1892-93 doubtless form one divided verse; but even so 1895-97 are acceptable, particularly in this play, as an exchange in trimeter and tetrameter verse. It seems a distortion for the Globe to reline: Julia . Alas! Proteus . Why dost thou cry 'alas'? Julia . I cannot choose But pity her. Proteus . Wherefore shouldst thou pity her? 21 If 'Alas' be accepted as a separate line, there is no reason why the others may not be independent short lines as well, particularly in view of such a passage as this, which occurs shortly afterward: Silvia . From whom? Julia . From my Master, Sir Protheus , Madam. Silvia . Oh: he sends you for a Picture? Julia . I, Madam. Silvia . Ursula , bring my Picture there, Goe, give your Master this: tell him from me ( TGV 1932-37). The Globe here retains the short unlinked lines, and justly, and on this analogy should not have relined 1895-97. Curiously, the New Arden, which prints 1891-97 unlinked, reverses the Globe here and links 1932-33 and then 1934-35 although limping verse is produced. Correctly, neither attempts to print 1935-36 as a divided verse: the stage-business connected with the bringing of the picture after Silvia's command combined with the change of address justifies the beginning of her pentameter speech by an independent short verse. The Globe, usually followed by modern editors, has something of a tendency to distrust the common short ending lines to speeches and to reline in order to link these, particularly if thereby a short independent line can be brought within the system of divided verse. For example, the Folio correctly prints Coriolanus 2930-34 as O'recome with Pride, Ambitious, past all thinking Selfe-loving. Sicinius . And affecting one sole Throne, without assistance[.] Menenius . I thinke not so. Sicinius . We should by this, to all our Lamentation whereas the Globe, and modern editors, reline as Self-loving,— Sicinius . And affecting one sole throne, Without assistance. Menenius . I think not so. Although the use of the caesura after 'assistance' to substitute for a stressed syllable is less common than its substitution for an unstressed, the divided line is metrically acceptable as accentuating the thrust of Menenius' 'I think not so.' But since this abrupt denial was already given superior emphasis as a separate short line placed between two pentameters, it is difficult to see what is gained by relining, especially since the short ending 'Self-loving,—' is very far from being anomalous. Very likely this is one of the examples of how Shakespeare's versification has been sophisticated. A more curious example of the Globe relining, always followed, comes in Antony and Cleopatra 723-726: Once name you derogately: when to sound your name It not concern'd me. Anthony . My being in Egypt Cœsar , what was't to you? Cœsar . No more then my reciding heere at Rome . . . . The Globe relines: It not concern'd me. Antony . My being in Egypt, Cæsar, What was't to you? Since TLN 725 is a completely acceptable pentameter, it need scarcely be broken up to mend the meter; yet all the Globe has done is to interfere with the Folio lining only to trade off one short ending line for another. 22 The virtue of such tinkering remains obscure. Something of a parallel may be found in To let me be partaker. Cœsar . Doubt not sir, I knew it for my Bond. Exeunt . (522) which—like 'My being in Egypt . . . '—the Globe and editors chop up as To let me be partaker. Cœsar . Doubt not, sir; I knew it for my bond. Exeunt . Once more there has been a simple trade-off of one short line for another; but here the Globe seems to have been relining in order to end the scene with a short line, just as it relined the Folio Whether straight Ile lead you. Anthony . Let us Lepidus not lacke your companie. Lepidus . Noble Anthony , not sickenesse should detaine me. Flourish. Exit omnes . (876-880) to form the part-lines Whither straight I'll lead you. Antony . Let us, Lepidus, Not lack your company. Lepidus . Noble Antony, Not sickness should detain me. Flourish. Exeunt . Shakespeare sometimes—but by no means in a majority of instances—may close a scene with a short line; but the pattern is not so invariable or so powerful as to require an editor to reline satisfactory pentameters in order to oblige what is by no means even a majority convention. Two particular problems next occur which, since they may prove to be insoluble, require mention but not extended discussion. The first comes in a situation where, say, a speech ends with a short line and is followed by two separate short-line speeches but where the meter would permit the first of the two short speeches to be linked either with the closing line of the preceding speech or with the second short line. In either case a short line remains. The problem is to decide if any pattern may be discerned as to whether Shakespeare would ordinarily have had any preference for the second short speech to be the closing half of a divided verse or else for it to be a separate short-line speech between pentameters, the preceding pentameter acting as the divided verse. Pending a more complete analysis one may suggest that consistently useful patterns do not seem to exist. One possibility would be to inquire whether in a divided line Shakespeare more often preferred three stresses than two stresses before the break. What too few examples for statistical certainty reveal is something of a stand-off. If in Julius Cœsar I.iii, for instance, we count the position of the caesura in undivided full pentameters (corresponding to the break in a divided line), we find about 58 lines with a three-stress first half as against about 87 with a two-stress first half. In Measure for Measure II.iv the proportion is relatively balanced at about 75 each; in Cymbeline I.i there are about 22 three-stress versus 29 two-stress first halves before the caesura (although in this same scene in the divided verses the proportion is 6 and 3 with one case ambiguous). If, instead, we count the number of unlinked short ending and beginning lines as bearing more closely on the problem, we find that in Julius Cœsar as a whole we have about 20 three-stress unlinked closing lines as against only 6 two-stress; in Measure for Measure about 19 three-stress versus about 10 two-stress. For short unlinked beginning lines (which might be taken to have a general correspondence with the second half of a verse) Julius Cœsar shows perhaps only 1 of three stresses versus 4 of two stresses; Measure for Measure about 8 (some doubtful) three-stress beginning lines but only 2 two-stress. On the other hand, it may seem that statistics for divided pentameters where no option exists should be the most trustworthy. In this situation in Julius Cœsar one may find about 45 divided verses with a three-stress first half but 60 with a two-stress. On the contrary, Measure for Measure shows about 80 linked lines with three stresses in the first half as against about 40 with two stresses in the first half. Smaller samplings as in All's Well III.iii reveal perhaps 4 linked lines with three stresses in the first half versus 5 with two stresses; Coriolanus I.ii has 5 three-stress first halves and 2 two-stress, III.i has approximately 32 opening three-stress halves and 13 two-stress; Cymbeline I.ii has about 16 three-stress but only 7 two-stress. What these partial figures seem to show is that no exact correlation is necessarily found between the point of division of a full pentameter line and the two halves of a linked one. Julius Cœsar , it is true, in I.iii has a preponderance of full verses with a two-stress first half and also a preponderance in the play as a whole of two-stress first halves in linked lines. (In I.iii there are 2 linked verses with a three-stress first part as against 1 with a two-stress.) Also, the statistics for short unlinked closing lines agree in a majority of two-stress verses. If II.iv is typical of Measure for Measure , its relatively balanced count for three- and two-stress openings of full pentameters does not agree with its strong predilection for three-stress short separate ending lines and for three-stress first halves of a divided verse. On the whole, then, the more pertinent results are about what one would expect: the larger proportion of three-stress short closing lines to speeches agrees in general with the proportion of three-stress closing lines completed by two-stress opening lines of another speech in divided verse. The figures for the length of unlinked opening short lines correlate less exactly with the figures for two-stress second halves of divided verses, although this occasional difference may be due to the smaller number of short beginning lines upsetting the statistical picture. There is at least a possibility, then, that in the later plays Shakespeare increased the number of three-stress first halves in a divided verse over his habit in earlier plays; but fuller statistics are needed. It follows that if in three short lines an absolute metrical option existed whether to link the first and second or the second and third to form a pentameter by indention, beginning at least as early as Shakespeare's middle period (but with due regard for the characteristics of the play concerned) an editor would be playing the odds, all things being equal, if he opted as a consistent principle to divide ambiguous choices by selecting a three-stress short line for the first half. The question naturally follows, of course, whether all things are usually equal in such a situation. For instance, occasions arise in which the choice of a three-stress opening half of an ambiguous division could clash with what might be another possibility, a special factor that could have influenced Shakespeare in certain circumstances. Some indication exists that Steevens, followed by the Globe and most editors, was occasionally influenced in his choice of which short lines to link by a belief that some interchange between the characters, whether as intimate as a question-answer or merely a matter of direct address, was a valid justification for linkage as a metrical unit. A difficult question of content thus might enter the picture. Rosse . God save the King. King . Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane ? Rosse . From Fiffe, great King, Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie ( Mac. 71-74). Here not only the sense but also the anomaly of 'From Fiffe, great King' as a short beginning line dictate the inevitable arrangement. But when the question of address and the problem of an anomalous short opening line clash, the Globe's preference for speech and return produces debatable verse-division: But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, And leave them honeyless. Antony . Not stingless too. Brutus . O, yes, and soundless too: For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony ( JC V.i.34-37). Here there is insufficient reason to break the really significant rule that run-on lines without change of address, stage-business, or strong syntactical shifts should not begin a speech as an unlinked unit. The correct division is better as Antony . Not stinglesse too. Brutus . O yes, and soundlesse too: (2368-69) which clashes with the odds (though not in this play) that the beginning line of a linked speech will more often be three than two feet. Something of an interchange is still present, of course, but shifted from the Globe's division between Cassius and Antony (the more direct perhaps) to one between Antony and Brutus. A clearer case of disjunction comes in All's Well that Ends Well in which the Folio should be divided as Lafew . Nay, come your waies. Enter Hellen . King . This haste hath wings indeed. Lafew . Nay, come your waies, This is his Majestie, say your minde to him (698-702), whereas the Globe incorrectly links the King's comment to Lafeu's first address to Helen, a direct relationship, but at the excessive price of creating an anomalous short beginning line: Lafeu . Nay, come your ways. King . This haste hath wings indeed. Lafeu . Nay, come your ways (II.i.96-97). The same situation is found in Antony and Cleopatra which should be lined: Messenger . Newes (my good Lord) from Rome. Anthony . Grates me, the summe. Cleopatra . Nay heare them Anthony . Fulvia perchance is angry: Or who knowes (27-30); Take in that Kingdome, and Infranchise that: Perform't, or else we damme thee. Anthony . How, my Love? Cleopatra . Perchance? Nay and most like: You must not stay heere longer, your dismission (33-37). In both cases, presumably to emphasize direct address, the Globe faultily arranges as Attendant . News, my good lord, from Rome. Antony . Grates me: the sum. Cleopatra . Nay, hear them Antony. Perform't, or else we damn thee.' Antony . How, my love! Cleopatra . Perchance! nay, and most like. Although the two slight pieces of evidence of three-stress first halves of divided lines and direct interchange are present in the Globe arrangement of the above, these weak reeds must bend before the superior force of the evidence against ordinary beginning short lines of speeches, which the Globe so frequently violates. That this question of interchange as a pattern for linking lines is suspect is shown not only by the above but by any number of examples where the meter enforces a linking contrary to such a pattern, as in Macbeth : For a dark houre, or twaine. Macbeth . Faile not our Feast. Banquo. My Lord, I will not. (1013-15) 23 Under such conditions, Flatter (p. 88) is perhaps wrong in allowing a fancied pause after the end of Polonius' speech and then a rapid interchange between Claudius and Gertrude to sway him into arguing for a division of Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we wail for. King . Do you think 'tis this? Queen . It may be, very likely. Polon . Hath there been such a time—I'd faine know that—( Ham . II.ii.150 ff.) instead of the conventional And all we waile for. King . Do you thinke 'tis this? Queene . It may be very likely. (1180-82) The meter here is perfectly regular iambic, which in this play is to be preferred to the anapest required if the King's question begins a verse. In the next passage options are present but the simplicity of linking all part-lines, as is customary here, overweighs any theoretical attempt to divide question and answer: And Guardian of their Bones. Rosse . Will you to Scone? Macduff . No Cosin, Ile to Fife. Rosse . Well, I will thither. (970-973) Utterly ambiguous situations where no metrical or patterned hint suggests one or other division of short lines are not very common, a fact in itself perhaps of some significance. In such cases an editor may flip a coin or try to be consistent according to some principle or else inconsistent but according to some suggestion in the scene. An interesting example occurs in Macbeth : For ever knit. Macbeth . Ride you this afternoone? Banquo . I, my good Lord. (1003-5) Here editors have differed, as is to be expected. Curiously, the Globe arranges as in the Folio without any linkage. Kittredge and the Pelican divide as For ever knit. Macbeth . Ride you this afternoon? Banquo . Ay, my good lord. whereas Alexander, the New Arden, New Penguin, Riverside prefer the question-answer (and the three-stress first half): Macbeth . Ride you this afternoon? Banquo . Ay, my good lord. In an example from Measure for Measure That's bitter, to sweet end. Enter Peter . Mariana . I would Frier Peter Isabella . Oh, peace, the Frier is come. (2333-36) modern editors follow the Globe in linking Mariana's and Isabella's short lines although the New Arden instead, divides a verse, between 'That's bitter to sweet end' and Mariana. In the nature of the case we lack all evidence as to Shakespeare's intentions, and indeed we cannot be certain that he would always follow the same pattern, if in fact he had one in mind. 24 If consistency is a virtue, an editor has a choice of adhering regularly to one of three options for dealing with these troublesome but fortunately rare problems: (1) he can prefer always to link the short closing line of the preceding speech with the first short line, or, contrariwise, always to link the two independent short lines; (2) he can link variably according to his estimate of the directness or not of an interchange; (3) he can play the odds that in most plays an initial three-stress part-line is more likely to link with a completing two-stress than a two with a three, but he can vary according to the characteristics of the specific play and the evidence of its non-optional linked lines. In the present state of our information either the first or the third seems the best bet: little confidence can be placed in the interchange or question-and-answer assumption; 25 and if such an interchange is not present, logically the first separate short line would then need to be linked willy-nilly with the short closing, a good option also in case the 3-2 division does not work. As remarked, however, all things may not be equal; and though it seems advisable for an editor to be guided chiefly by one of these three (or two) options, yet some calculated inconsistency may be introduced on what could appear to be evidence of another nature (even though fragile) about Shakespeare's intentions. A small example comes in Cymbeline : Which way they went. 2 How long is this ago? 1 Some twenty yeares. 2 That a Kings Children should be so convey'd (70-73). Modern editors follow the Globe in arranging Which way they went. 2 How long is this ago? a solution with which there can be little quarrel. This scene has begun with five passages of dialogue between the two gentlemen, each speech of the first ending with a part-line completed by a short question from the second. The first four have linked a three-foot closing line to a two-foot following question, but the fifth has reversed the stresses in the two halves. If this pattern were to be followed, then three-stress 71 should link with closing two-stress 70, leaving 72 as the only short unlinked line in the scene except for the exit closing dimeter. One may note, also, that the two speeches immediately following this crux both link the second gentleman's three-stress part-line question with the closing two-stress short line of the first's preceding speech. Sufficient evidence of another sort is exhibited in Coriolanus 354-359, the Folio arranged thus by all editors following the Globe: Till we can do no more. All . The Gods assist you. Aufidius . And keepe your Honors safe. 1. Senator . Farewell. 2. Senator Farewell. All . Farewell. Exeunt omnes . Here the key is Shakespeare's occasional use of a separate short line for an exit. It is true that this would still be preserved if lines 355-356 were linked, but the contrast with pentameters would then be lost. The next example depends upon a moot point of metrics and is thus more arguable: And throw their power i'th' dust. Brutus . Manifest Treason. Sicinius . This a Consull? No. Brutus . The Ediles hoe: Let him be apprehended. ( Cor. 1871-74) The Globe and all editors line the Folio as above. If 1871-72 were to be linked, a line of five iambs would throw a wrong stress on 'Manifest'; the option would be to scan the second half after the caesura as a dactyl and trochee. It could be suggested that such powerful emphasis conventionally appears in the beginning of a line instead of in its latter half and that a very strong verse is made by linking Brutus' and Sicinius' short lines. Two of these examples happen to link a closing line with a short separate, although the third example makes a complete verse of the short closing and links the next two short lines. In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say whether Shakespeare had any preference in such a situation. Two have the first half of the linked line in three stresses, the more popular pattern for many plays. The third example, with a two-stress first half, appears in a scene in which elsewhere four such linkages have been of the three and two pattern but three of the reverse. If the example is correct, the scene would be evenly balanced in this pattern. The only point in presenting these examples is to suggest that some reason for selecting the two parts of a divided verse from among three equal components is better than none. Among the lack of reasons one may well place editorial tradition transmitted through the Globe, even though in the above three cases the tradition seems to be preferable to the alternatives. When no grounds may exist for a reasoned preference, then an editor may appeal to consistency either in linking the closing short with the first of the two short separate lines, or dividing the verse between the two separate shorts. Or he can split the ticket by surveying the non-optional divided lines in the play in question and then making his decision to correspond with the majority pattern they present, either three and two stresses, or two and three, according to the play. The second problem concerns the kind and amount of metrical anomaly that an editor can accept in joining two short lines to form a divided verse according to his estimate of Shakespeare's intention. In brief, the problem boils down to the question whether an editor is justified in attempting to link two short lines that, joined, would create either a normal tetrameter or a hexameter. In the preceding discourse the general position has been taken that a divided verse could exhibit the same irregularities as an irregular pentameter within a pentameter speech, especially in the matter of the caesural suppression of either an unaccented or an accented syllable. The question then arises, whether the occasional tetrameters, and the rarer hexameters, that one sometimes finds within pentameter passages justify the linking of two or more short lines to form a corresponding irregularity in a divided verse. [ tetrameter ] (The Breeze upon her) like a Cow in June, Hoists Sailes, and flyes. Enobarbus . That I beheld: Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not Indure a further view. ( Ant. 1993-97) [ hexameter ] And let goe by the Actor. Isabella . Oh just, but severe Law: I had a brother then; heaven keepe your honour. ( MM 787-789) In both of these examples, the Globe says 'yes,' and by indenting the short beginning line to complete the short ending line, and numbering the verse accordingly, it and various editors assert the principle that lines other than pentameters may be treated as divided verse. 26 Other irregular lines in the Folio that the Globe et al link as one divided verse may be quoted: [ tetrameter ] Where if you bring not Martius , wee'l proceede In our first way. Menenius . Ile bring him to you. Let me desire your company: he must come ( Cor. 2077-80); [ hexameters ] I prythee noble friend, home to thy House, Leave us to cure this Cause. Menenius . For 'tis a Sore upon us, You cannot Tent your selfe: be gone, 'beseech you. ( Cor. 1957-60); I will be correspondent to command And doe my spryting, gently. Prospero . Doe so: and after two daies I will discharge thee. Ariel . That's my noble Master ( Temp. 427-430); With a most false effect: and I, the truer, So to be false with her. Queene . No further service, Doctor, Untill I send for thee. Cornelius . I humbly take my leave. ( Cymb. 540-544); But he do's buy my Injuries, to be Friends: Payes deere for my offences. [Exit] Posthumus . Should we be taking leave As long a terme as yet we have to live ( Cymb. 124-127); 'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou heare more my Lord? Cymbeline . All that belongs to this. Iachimo . That Paragon, thy daughter, For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits ( Cymb. 3424-27); Tetrameters are not expandable, but various hexameters may yield (not to slurring, which is infrequently required in full pentameter passages, but) to elision: Of that darke houre: resolve your selves apart, Ile come to you anon. Murtherers . We are resolv'd, my Lord. Macbeth . Ile call upon you straight: abide within, ( Mac. 1144-47) where the normal elision of 'We are' to 'We're' takes care of the pentameter by an anapest. So with Coriolanus 3073-75. Here the New Arden and New Penguin are alone in reproducing the Folio lining, which in the New Arden arrangement depends upon Menenius contracting 'You have' to 'Y'have' to match Cominius' 'Y'are': Cominius . Y'are goodly things, you Voyces. Menenius . You have made good worke You and your cry. Shal's to the Capitoll? The New Penguin arrangement without indention creates an anomalous and undesirable run-on short opening line for Menenius. The New Arden, thus, is superior to it and superior to the bibliographically unnecessary relining by the Globe and most editors Cominius . Ye're goodly things, you voices! Menenius . You have made Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol? with its final hexameter or else a double feminine ending. 27 How do's your Patient, Doctor? Doctor . Not so sicke my Lord, As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies ( Mac. 2257-60). This divided line is debatably a hexameter with a lyric caesura, not a forced pentameter formed with an epic caesura and 'Not so sicke' as an anapest. (But see below.) It seems clear that enough evidence can be gathered to compel an editor to face up to the problem of division posed by anomalous extra-metrical and deficient lines. Without calling Shakespeare up from the grave to testify, one may confess that his intention can often be in considerable doubt. On the one hand, it is legitimate to take it that if he can write internal hexameters (or tetrameters) in pentameter context like Angelo . That you might know it would much better please me, Then to demand what 'tis: your Brother cannot live. ( MM 1036-37) then he can also write them as divided verses. Yet the difficulty seems to arise that given the relative frequency of undivided to divided lines in any play, there are many more of these problem divided lines than should be statistically present; moreover, it is uncomfortable that the divided hexameters seem to be in the considerable majority whereas the opposite seems to be true in undivided verse. If all of the examples exhibited the characteristics common to the separate short beginning lines of speeches following a pentameter ending of the preceding speech—that is, commands, stage-business, change of address, marked rhetorical break—it would be easy to argue that these lines must not be linked, for by juxtaposing this attention-gathering device to the flexibility of a short line concluding a speech, Shakespeare had achieved the ultimate in natural ease of verse dialogue. Some observed examples, it is true, encourage this view, as in Enobarbus' 'That I beheld' or Isabella's 'Oh just, but severe Law', both linked by the Globe but able to stand alone. To these may be added two examples, already mentioned, which the Globe inconsistently treats as separate unlinked lines: And prayes you to beleeve him. Duke . 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus: Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne? ( Oth. 373-375); Then violent'st Contrariety. Enter Messenger . Messenger . You are sent for to the Senate: A fearefull Army, led by Caius Martius ( Cor. 2985-88). On the other hand, several examples (all linked by the Globe) may be observed that under ordinary circumstances should not permit a separate short beginning line. In this category comes Menenius' 'For 'tis a Sore upon us' and Prospero's 'Doe so: and after two daies'. To these can be added: Under these hard Conditions, as this time Is like to lay upon us. Cassius . I am glad that my weake words Have strucke but this much shew of fire from Brutus . ( JC 273-276) This last example, especially, poses a problem, since Kittredge, New Arden, and New Penguin, for example, reline to avoid the hexameter: Is like to lay upon us. Cassius . I am glad That my weak words have struck but thus much show Of fire from Brutus. This is an attractive emendation, particularly since it not only rids the verse of an extreme irregularity in the opening short line, if unlinked, but also provides a short closing line to the speech before Cæsar's entrance. (The Globe, Alexander, and Riverside, on the contrary, retain the Folio lineation and link the two part-lines as a hexameter.) Relining is also possible in the Tempest 427-431 crux, as in And doe my spryting, gently. Prospero . Doe so: and after two daies I will [ i.e. , I'll] discharge thee. Ariel . That's my noble Master: What shall I doe? say what? what shall I doe? Ariel's exclamation followed by what is close to a change of address in his direct question to Prospero makes an acceptable short line to begin his speech, much better than 'Doe so: and after two daies', completing a divided hexameter. 28 Coriolanus 1958-61 might be subject to more drastic relining, though no more so, perhaps, than the frequently accepted relining of Julius Cœsar 273-276. Leave us to cure this Cause. Menenius . For 'tis a Sore Upon us you cannot Tent your selfe: Be gone, 'beseech you. Comenius . Come Sir, along with us. If the rhetorical tetrameter is objectionable, one could read: Upon us you cannot Tent your selfe: be gone, 'Beseech you. Comenius . Come Sir, along with us. In this case the divided line with Comenius would suppress the arsis. 29 Nevertheless, too many of these divided hexameters cannot be removed by relining. In such cases it is a question whether the cure is worse than the disease; that is, does an editor take it that it is better to link two hypermetrical part-lines or to treat them as separate verses at the expense of violating one of Shakespeare's most important verse patterns, the special purpose for the short beginning line of a speech. Something may be said for the view that, at least in these exceptional circumstances, editors have traditionally but not invariably preferred to link two part lines to form a divided hexameter. The same problem involving the nature of the opening line of a speech occurs when it is preceded not by the short closing line of a speech but by an independent short line which cannot be prose. In the first example the change of address in Cæsar's speech makes it quite ambiguous whether Antony's short line should be treated as an independent verse, and Cæsar's speech should begin with an independent short beginning line, or whether they should be linked at the expense of forming a hexameter. Antony . So to most Noble Cœsar . Cœsar . Bid them prepare within: I am too blame to be thus waited for. ( JC 1116-18) Editors have followed the Globe in linking the part-lines, but the special nature of 'Bid them prepare within' suggests that they have been ill advised not to treat it as a separate verse as in the Folio. In the next example it could barely be an open question whether the beginning line qualifies as a special situation, for the rhetorical break is slight indeed: Angelo . Plainlie conceive I love you. Isabella . My brother did love Juliet , And you tell me that he shall die for't. ( MM 1153-55) The Globe here chooses inconsistently to treat each as a separate verse. On the whole, an editor is playing the odds in such situations when he declines to create hexameters and opts for a series of short lines. Folio Antickt us all. What needs more words? goodnight. Good Anthony your hand. Pompey . Ile try you on the shore. Anthony . And shall Sir, gives your hand. Pompey . Oh Anthony , you have my Father house. But what, we are Friends? Come downe into the Boate. Enobarbus . Take heed you fall not Menas : Ile not on shore, No to my Cabin: these Drummes, These Trumpets, Flutes: what ( Ant. 1479-88). The Globe and editors go through considerable contortions in arranging these lines, including the creation of an unnecessary hexameter: Good Antony, your hand. Pompey . I'll try you on the shore. Antony . And shall, sir: give's your hand. Pompey . O Antony, You have my father's house,—But, what? we are friends. Come, down into the boat. Enobarbus . Take heed you fall not. Menas, I'll not on shore. Menas . No, to my cabin. These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what? (IV.vi.133-138). The hexameter in line 133 is no more justified than the two concluding lines of the scene, which the Globe correctly treats as independent short lines: Enobarbus . Ho! says a'. There's my cap. Menas . Ho! Noble captain, come. [ Exeunt . If one accepts short separate lines, the passage is more simply arranged, close to the Folio: Good Anthony your hand. Pompey . Ile try you on the shore. Anthony . And shall Sir, gives your hand. Pompey . Oh Anthony you have my Father[s] house. But what, we are Friends? Come[,] downe into the Boate. Enobarbus . Take heed you fall not[.] [ Exeunt .] Menas [,] Ile not on shore, No[,] to my Cabin: these Drummes, these Trumpets, Flutes: what[?] Under any circumstances the last line is going to be irregular. 30 Another case where two short lines may be preferable to the Globe's hexameter comes in Measure for Measure , 1111-15: That longing have bin sicke for, ere I'ld yeeld My body up to shame. Angelo . Then 31 must your brother die. Isabella. And 'twer the cheaper way: Better it were a brother dide at once . . . As would be expected, the Globe and other editors link in a hexameter 'My body up to shame' with 'Then must your brother die.' It is interesting to observe that elsewhere in the dialogue of Isabella and Angelo between her entrance and his exit (1034-1184) Isabella speaks six independent short lines and Angelo four for a total of ten. Excluding the passage above, Isabella has four speeches that end in a short unlinked line as compared with eight for Angelo, for a total of twelve. Finally, there are elsewhere eight clear cases of linked short lines. The proportion of separate independent lines in this dialogue by no means discourages the suggested arrangement, then, whereas the high proportion of unlinked ending lines suggests that if an editor were to link any of the three short lines it should be 'Then must your brother die' with 'And 'twer the cheaper way', a course not to be recommended, however. About the first of the next examples there can be only a trifling question, and it is properly linked by the Globe despite the hexameter that is created. The second is only slightly more doubtful, since relining is possible, but the odds favor its authenticity as a hexameter. 32 Belarius . Is not this Boy reviv'd from death? Arviragus . One Sand another Not more resembles that sweet Rosie Lad ( Cymb. 3392-94); Antony . For Brutus sake, I am beholding to you. 4 What does he say of Brutus ? 3 He sayes, for Brutus sake He findes himselfe beholding to us all. ( JC 1599-1602). The final situation involving the division of hypermetrical lines concerns the concluding short line of a speech followed by a single short line. Here there is a much weaker incentive to link the two short lines since the criteria applicable to the short line beginning a speech have no applicability to an independent or single short line. Ordinarily editors are inclined to link such lines if the result is metrically regular but to be somewhat wary (although not wary enough) when anomalies would be created. Sometimes the pattern in the adjacent lines both before and after may provide a hint, but Shakespeare is by no means so regulated as to close himself in with rigid schema even in the more formal versification of the early plays. Gratiano . This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make [a] stand. Salarino . His houre is almost past. ( MV 896-898) Editors follow the Globe in linking the above lines. And bid them bring the Trumpets to the gate: But send me Flavius first. Peter . It shall be speeded well. ( MM 2316-18) Again, editors follow the Globe in linking the two short lines. To yond generation, you shal finde Your safetie manifested. Provost . I am your free dependant. Exit . Duke . Quicke, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo[.] ( MM 2172-75) Most editors follow the Globe in inconsistently treating these short lines as separate verses, but Kittredge arbitrarily divides 2175 so that 'Quick, dispatch' completes a pentameter with the Provost's exit line. So leaves me, to consider what is breeding, That changes thus his Manners. Camillo . I dare not know (my Lord.) ( WT 480-482) Editors follow the Globe in treating these short lines as separate verses. When one surveys the interrelationships between these three categories, certain tentative observations may be made. So far as observed, the separate short lines preceding a speech beginning with a short line offer no evidence in favor of divided tetrameters although some occasional evidence is found in favor of divided hexameters. The evidence of a short line ending a speech followed by another beginning the next speech, insofar as one can trust the four examples observed, is not in favor of editorial arrangement as linked verses. Coriolanus 1191-92 and 2079-80 show a change of address, perhaps the strongest evidence normally found in favor of the independence of a short line beginning a speech. Antony and Cleopatra 1994-95 and Measure for Measure 788-789 both have a marked rhetorical pause, reinforced in the example from Measure for Measure by what is very close to a change of address from Isabella's exclamation made largely to herself then shifting to a farewell to Angelo. Until equally pertinent evidence to the contrary is turned up (and perhaps it does exist), an editor would be advised to heed the pattern of short opening lines and to decline any attempt to link short lines to form a tetrameter. Cautiousness in this respect may be reinforced by the example of editorial struggles to reline Coriolanus 2904-6, which reads in the Folio: Sicinius . 'Tis he, 'tis he: O he is grown most kind of late: Haile Sir. Menenius . Haile to you both. Sicinius . Your Coriolanus is not much mist, but with his [ prose, as printed, completes speech ]. The Globe and Riverside arrange, with an opening hexameter (or a normal pentameter if 'he is' is pronounced 'he's'), and emend as: Sicinius . 'Tis he, 'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late. Both Tribunes . Hail, sir! Menenius . Hail to you both! Sicinius . Your Coriolanus Is not much miss'd, but with his friends: Kittredge, Alexander, New Arden, and New Penguin prefer an arrangement that produces a divided tetrameter by completing a speech with a short separate line: Sicinius . 'Tis he, 'tis he! O, he is grown most kind Of late.—Hail, sir! Menenius . Hail to you both! Sicinius . Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd. This would be acceptable if 'Hail to you both' were not indented as part of a line but were given separate-verse status: it would appear to be anomalous to reject a normal short separate line and hitch it to an ending short line at the expense of creating an irregular tetrameter. Another possibility suggests itself, particularly when one sees how crowded is the Folio page by the compositor's difficulty with cast-off copy forcing him to set verse as prose and to tuck Menenius' line in the white space to the right of 'Haile Sir' after the full line of the opening ''Tis he' etc. Three Folio lines would have been required by an arrangement that might perhaps have existed in the manuscript: Sicinius . 'Tis he, 'tis he: O he is grown most kind of late: Haile Sir. Menenius . Haile to you both. Sicinius . Your Coriolanus is not much mist . . . . If it is possible in the present state of our knowledge to be fairly forthright in barring divided tetrameters (for if one accepts tetrameters, why not divided trimeters and even dimeters?), some relaxation seems required by the evidence in the matter of divided hexameters, a slightly easier concession when one can take account of possible slurring on some occasions and no doubt simple carelessness in others, with textual corruption also possible but not to be relied on. In the nature of the case, some few divided hexameters may be avoided by relining, particularly if a bibliographical explanation for the printed anomaly can be offered. Nevertheless, certain of these hexameters appear in the text on a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't basis: that is, it is a nasty choice to be forced to accept a divided hexameter or else the violation of the strong pattern of the comparative self-sufficiency of short beginning lines. This may be the situation with Coriolanus 1957-61 (although somewhat draconian relining is possible) but it can be observed more clearly in Julius Cœsar 1599-1602 and Cymbeline 3392-94. What one comes up with is the view that although some must be accepted, many of the divided hexameters that editors customarily adopt and some that, inconsistently, they do not adopt, are better off as separate lines whenever the observed pattern justifying a short beginning line can reasonably be applied, this whether the preceding short line is the closing line of a speech or a separate single line. If it is logical for the Globe and later editors to treat 'My brother did love Juliet ' ( MM 1154) and ''Tis certaine then for Cyprus' ( Oth. 374) as separate verse lines, it is even more logical to remove the editorial linkage of cases like 'Bid them prepare within' ( JC 1117). Such procedures will solve a number of problems and leave in a minority, perhaps, the situations where the treatment of a short run-on or other non-special-purpose beginning line as a verse unit is inapplicable. In some cases plausible although not demonstrably correct relineation may remove the problem, as in The Tempest 427-430 and possibly in Julius Cœsar 273-276. Yet Cymbeline 3392-94 illustrates a second category in which an editor would be almost certainly wrong were he to reline, although the below is just faintly possible: Belarius . Is not this Boy reviv'd from death? Arviragus . One Sand another not more resembles that Sweet Rosie Lad: who dyed, and was Fidele : What thinke you? Guiderius . The same dead thing alive. It is perhaps wisest to assume that a few problems like this will always arise where one must accept a divided hexameter instead of an anomalous run-on short opening line or else submit the passage to radical relineation. However, it would also be wiser to accept these as sports, and to print as few of them as possible. As an alternative to the 'naked' opening line such as AYL 1044, TN 980, Cor. 88, or Cymb. 2178 cited earlier as examples of probably authentic but anomalous short first lines not to be linked and generally not to be removed by relineation, a divided hexameter is probably preferable so long as such divisions are not considered to represent normality. As remarked, carelessness, the exigencies of revision, or textual corruption may account for them chiefly; nevertheless, it seems to be true that on some occasions Shakespeare deliberately wrote a loose verse scannable either as a hexameter if strictly accented but actually as an intended pentameter with more flexible accentuation. 33 As for short single lines that would create a tetrameter or hexameter if linked to the short closing line of a preceding speech, or to another short single line, no possibility exists for determining their authenticity. It is therefore conservative to ignore anomalous linkings and to treat extra-metrical single lines as separate verses in arrangement and in line numbering. What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselves Betwixt your Eyes, and Night? Cassius . Shall I entreat a word? ( JC 728-730) I, and my Sword, will earne our Chronicle, There's hope in't yet. Cleopatra . That's my brave Lord. ( Ant. 2359-61) The Globe correctly does not attempt to divide the above short lines, but it cannot resist the temptation in Upon the first encounter drave them. Anthony . Well, what worst. ( Ant. 180-181) to link the short line despite the resulting hexameter. Some erratic and inconsistent arrangements of part-lines appear in modern editors as a heritage of the Globe's dislike of independent short lines in pentameter context. That these short lines are legitimate and for a verse-speaker are to be considered as a separate line of verse is incontestable: Cœsar . Set on, and leave no Ceremony out. Soothsayer. Cœsar . Cœsar . Ha? Who calles? ( JC 100-102); Cœsar. Calphurnia . Caska . Peace ho, Cœsar speakes. Cœsar . Calphurnia . Calphurnia . Heere my Lord. ( JC 87-90); Cassius . Will you go see the order of the course? Brutus . Not I. Cassius . I pray you do. ( JC 116-117); Coriolanus . Hah? what is that? Brutus . It will be dangerous to goe on—No further. Coriolanus . What makes this change? Menenius . The matter? Cominius . Hath he not pass'd the Noble, and the Common? ( Cor. 1705-9). The above examples are scarcely to be tinkered with, 34 but in less obvious cases the Globe is often inconsistent in its treatment. Sometimes it goes to extremes in an attempt to link lines that by any rational standards should remain independent, as in Folio When will you goe? Silvia . This evening comming. Eglamour . Where shall I meete you? Silvia . At Frier Patrickes Cell, Where I intend holy Confession. (TGV 1810-14) which is arranged by the Globe and modern editors as When will you go? Silvia . This evening coming. Eglamour . Where shall I meet you? Silvia . At Friar Patrick's cell. That 1812-13 should divide a pentameter does not require editors to force the same pattern on 1810-11 to produce a tetrameter or else a line impossible to scan though with five stresses, as by making 'evening' into three syllables and placing the final stress on the 'ing' of 'coming'. Given the numerous examples of short-line dialogue in this play, which the Globe does not try to link, like Silvia . From whom? Julia . From my Master, Sir Protheus , Madam. Silvia . Oh: he sends you for a Picture? Julia . I, Madam. (1932-35), it may seem that editors are ill-advised not only in TLN 1810-11 but in the following, to force division at the expense of a hypermetrical line: Valentine . No, I will not; for it boots thee not. Protheus . What? (31-32) arranged as Valentine . No, I will not, for it boots thee not. Proteus . What? an example that is inconsistent with She is dead belike? Protheus . Not so: I thinke she lives. Julia . Alas. (1892-93) (But see Ant. 1488.) However, the Folio continues: Protheus . Why do'st thou cry alas? Julia . I cannot choose but pitty her. Protheus . Wherefore should'st thou pitty her? (1895-97) which editors reline as: Proteus . Why dost thou cry 'alas'? Julia . I cannot choose But pity her. Proteus . Wherefore shouldst thou pity her? an arrangement that is suspect. 35 An equally common type of editorial interference comes in Coriolanus : Coriolanus . Have you inform'd them sithence? Brutus . How? I informe them? Cominius . You are like to doe such businesse. Brutus . Not unlike each way to better yours. Coriolanus . Why then should I be Consull? by yond Clouds (1732-36). Here the Globe and editors, perhaps correctly, link the first two lines 36 but then take it that this division justifies relining two separate verses to secure a continuation of the linkage: Cominius . You are like to do such business. Brutus . Not unlike, Each way, to better yours. The peculiar virtue of relining Brutus' speech, which is an excellent pentameter, in order to complete 1733 is obscure when the result is merely to substitute a short ending line for the normal independent line given to Cominius. But the Globe dislikes these independent short lines. An egregious example comes in All's Well : The King is render'd lost. Countesse . This was your motive for Paris , was it, speake? (563-564) which the Globe relines as: The king is render'd lost. Countess . This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak. Only some quite unwarranted doubt that the Countess' line 564 was not an acceptable pentameter could rationalize such interference, which modern editors have perpetuated. So in Antony and Cleopatra we have the Folio Once name you derogately: when to sound your name It not concern'd me. Anthony . My being in Egypt Cœsar , what was't to you? Cœsar . No more then my reciding heere at Rome (723-726) relined superfluously by the Globe as It not concern'd me. Antony . My being in Egypt, Cæsar, What was't to you? Or another example from All's Well : Hellen . What is your pleasure Madam? Countesse . You know Hellen I am a mother to you. (460-461) which the Globe treats as Helen . What is your pleasure madam? Countess . You know, Helen, I am a mother to you. Usually when there is an opportunity, the Globe will split the concluding pentameter of a scene in order to produce a short ending line for the exit: Of stirres abroad, I shall beseech you Sir To let me be partaker. Cœsar . Doubt not sir, I knew it for my Bond. Exeunt . ( Ant. 520-522); And do invite you to my Sisters view, Whether straight Ile lead you. Anthony. Let us Lepidus not lacke your companie. Lepidus . Noble Anthony , not sickenesse should detaine me. Flourish. Exit omnes . ( Ant. 875-880). The Globe arbitrarily breaks up Antony's and Lepidus' pentameters 37 to read: Whither straight I'll lead you. Antony . Let us, Lepidus, Not lack your company. Lepidus . Noble Antony, Not sickness should detain me. To let me be partaker. Cœsar . Doubt not, sir; I knew it for my bond. Although Shakespeare occasionally ends scenes with the short line of a concluding longer speech (or an independent short line), his pattern is by no means so marked as to justify editorial interference with the Folio lining. 38 The case is altered, of course, when adjustment of division must be made in extremely anomalous Folio arrangement. Yeelds us kinde answere. Miranda . 'Tis a villaine Sir, I doe not love to looke on. Propspero . But as 'tis We cannot misse him: he do's make our fire ( Temp. 444-447). Here the relining to Yeelds us kinde answere. Miranda . 'Tis a villaine Sir, I doe not love to looke on. Prospero . But as 'tis is required not at all to provide a link for the short ending line 444 but instead to make a divided verse of the Folio's highly irregular independent short opening run-on line 'But as 'tis' at 446, a consideration that could not have weighed with the Globe even though it relines correctly. Other considerations, such as desirable double linkage, may dictate the division of a full Folio pentameter. A good example comes in Macbeth : To mend it or be rid on't. Macbeth . Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie. Murtherers . True, my Lord. Macbeth . So is he mine: and in such bloody distance (1116-19) where the Globe and editors rearrange to To mend it, or be rid on't. Macbeth . Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy. Both Murderers . True, my lord. This relining appears to be justified only in part because it links both halves of the divided line but chiefly because it occurs in a scene in which without exception all other short lines in the dialogue between Macbeth and the murderers are linked. Under these circumstances the two short lines 1116 and 1118 would seem to be anomalous and in need of emendation. 39 However, if only one half of the divided line were linked by rearrangement, the division of a full pentameter in this manner would not be advisable. The Globe is too often guilty of this latter unnecessary tinkering, as illustrated above by Cor. 1731-35, AWW 563-564 and 460-461, or Ant. 723-726. The Globe's inconsistency in dividing verses is a serious fault. And there is nothing left remarkeable Beneath the visiting Moone. Charmion . Oh quietnesse, Lady. Iras . She's dead too, our Soveraigne. Charmion . Lady. Iras . Madam. Charmion . Oh Madam, Madam, Madam. Iras . Royall Egypt: Empresse. Charmion . Peace, peace, Iras . ( Ant. 3079-87) Here, presumably in order to provide a link with the closing line 3080, the Globe, followed by Kittredge, the New Arden, and Riverside, arranges the short lines so that, in effect, this unlinked closing line is transferred awkwardly by splitting 3086, an arrangement for which no other need exists. Beneath the visiting moon. Charmion . O, quietness, lady! Iras . She is dead too, our sovereign. Charmion . Lady! Iras . Madam! Charmion . O madam, madam, madam! Iras . Royal Egypt, Empress. Charmion . Peace, peace, Iras! Alexander, followed by the Pelican editor, recognized the ineptness of this solution but had no better expedient than to print all as unlinked short lines, an improbable arrangement. Actually, the division of the verses is quite simple once one accepts the conventional short ending line 3079: Beneath the visiting Moone. Charmion . Oh quietnesse, Lady. Iras . She's dead too, our Soveraigne. Charmion . Lady. Iras . Madam. Charmion . Oh Madam, Madam, Madam. Iras . Royall Egypt: Empresse. Charmion . Peace, peace, Iras . On the other hand, in Measure for Measure the Globe allows a short ending line to stand that is eminently linkable, as You must walke by us, on our other hand: And good supporters are you. Enter Peter and Isabella . Peter . Now is your time[:] Speake loud, and kneele before him (2365-69) and instead combines 2368-69 into a single pentameter. This is an eccentric rearrangement and cannot be urged even by the present-day bibliographical knowledge that 2368-69 being too long for the measure could have been divided by the compositor. The Folio arrangement by which a pentameter single speech is divided to link its first half with the short closing line of the preceding speech although in its second half leaving an unlinked short line is so common that emendation to restore the undivided pentameter is unnecessary and even intrusive. 40 A final problem is at present so complex and relatively unanalyzed as to prevent more than cursory mention. As would be expected, editors have differed widely in their attempts to create divided verses out of short lines in a dialogue in which a prose speaker discourses with one or more verse speakers. Some scenes offer little difficulty: editors of Julius Cœsar have treated Casca, properly, as a consistent prose speaker in I.ii despite a tolerable opening pentameter, I.ii.215 (318-319), though set as prose, and a tolerable tetrameter in his second speech, line 218 (322); at line 233 (336) he could complete a pentameter with Cassius; he approaches his exit with what could be scanned as verse in lines 295-296 (396-397); and, in between, various of his short answers would lift no eyebrows were they present in verse dialogue. Nevertheless, it is probable that Casca is intended to be exclusively a prose speaker in this scene, although a verse speaker elsewhere. Not all decisions are so relatively simple, as evidence the varied editorial treatment given Lucio's speeches in Measure for Measure, I.ii. Shakespeare's general tendency seems to be either to be consistent in treating a prose speaker, like Casca in JC I.ii, or else to set off in blocks the shift of a character from verse to prose (or the other way round) as with Oliver in As You Like It when, joined by Rosalind as Ganymede, he switches at the end of IV.iii.166ff. (2321). Or in Measure for Measure V.i when Lucio opens as a verse speaker (l. 75, TLN 2435), but shifts to prose (l. 179, TLN 2552) and, pace editors, remains a prose speaker for the rest of the scene. In this stretch of Lucio's prose, editors, nevertheless, have him divide a line with the Duke (l. 214, TLN 2587). He speaks what could be an acceptable pentameter in line 306 (2683). For the rest, prose prevails, and it is certain that in this block system the attempt to introduce a part-line of verse at V.i.214 is ill-advised and a distortion. When one reverts to I.ii the main question arises whether Lucio is a prose speaker throughout or else a verse speaker at random. The evidence is slight for Lucio as a verse speaker, scarcely more than in V.i, in fact. He opens the scene in prose and so continues until his re-entrance at l.128 (TLN 215) when he addresses Claudio with a perfect pentameter: 'Why how now Claudio ? whence comes this restraint.' Yet his next speech in response to Claudio's verse is in prose and then follow (228-231) four short question-and-answer lines between the two that do not link (except when forced to by the New Arden editor alone), until one comes to the Folio mislining at ii.146-148 (233-236): Claudio . One word, good friend: Lucio , a word with you. Lucio . A hundred: If they'll doe you any good: Is Lechery so look'd after? This the Globe and most editors arrange as: Claudio . One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you. Lucio . A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd after? No editor has been able to resist the temptation to link Lucio's 'With childe perhaps? (248) by completing a pentameter with Claudio's 'Unhappely, even so.' Finally, after two prose speeches at 265-267 and 280-284, most editors follow the Globe in assigning Lucio's 'Within two houres' (286) as verse by completing it with Claudio's exit line 'Come Officer, away' (287). The difficulty of deciding what is prose and what verse has led editors to a variety of arrangements. All print 215 as verse; Alexander and the Pelican arrange 235-236 as prose but the rest as verse; all divide 248-249 as verse; and all divide 286-287. Curiously, the Globe (and Riverside), which likes to rearrange so as to end a scene with a separate part line, links Lucio . Within two hours. Claudio . Come, officer, away! instead of the equally metrical alternative (with an epic caesura): Claudio . I thank you, good friend Lucio. Lucio . Within two hours. which has whatever virtue may inhere to a three-foot first half and a direct exchange of words. The evidence for Lucio as a mixed prose and verse speaker in this scene is scarcely better than that for Casca in Julius Cœsar I.ii, where there is also what could pass for an opening pentameter by Casca and some short lines that could link. Until the whole question of verse lining is resurveyed with different texts from our sophisticated modern editions, and the question of Shakespeare's use of characters as random prose and verse speakers instead of with ordered, or blocked variation, is settled, editors may be suspicious of counting as verse such possibly fortuitous hits as 'With child, perhaps?' and the like. At the most, it would seem, Lucio in this scene might be allowed an opening pentameter on his re-entrance but thereafter be confined to prose exclusively, including such fortuitous hits as 'With child, perhaps?' and the like. Whatever the results of further investigation, it may seem that conventional editorial arrangement in Shakespearean mixed scenes of verse and prose needs to be more finely tuned since it is probable that too many prose speakers have been assigned random part-lines of verse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 As will be seen, the identification and authentication of verse lines go far beyond the rearrangement of false verse as prose or of text set as prose into metrically lined verse. Nor is the problem of the verse more than distantly related to the irregular and impossible lines created by compositors who failed to identify the short line beginning a speech and so included it as part of the first pentameter with consequent mislining of what follows; nor to the compositorial breaking of a line which would otherwise overflow the measure or else to the trick of making two lines not for this reason but to stretch out material to fill a surplus of space left by faulty casting-off of copy, or, at the opposite, of reducing the number of lines of verse by irregularly running them together in order to conserve space. 2 I am not competent to address the question whether actors' delivery is affected by visual verse arrangement. Since memorization of a part is done from printed texts, my guess is that the visual connections or disconnections could conceivably affect delivery, but whether this would be retained after complete familiarity with the part is an open question, except so far as the rhetorical effects of the verse itself would certainly hold. 3 I do not mean verbal emendation, except as a minor spin-off, but instead an investigation aimed directly at assessing the validity of the traditional metrical arrangement of Shakespeare's short verses on the basis of established evidence to replace a tradition that on occasion is mistaken, followed by the emendation of the division of verse lines as a result of fresh information about Shakespeare's (and the time's) characteristics. To give the devil his due, Richard Flatter opened the subject in the early chapters of Shakespeare's Producing Hand (1948) but with such eccentric results owing to his prepossessions that his study, and certainly his conclusions, are substantially worthless. 4 At present if one wants to use an act-scene-line reference system instead of the through-line numbering (TLN), for uniformity one is forced into the only common norm, the old-fashioned Globe edition which is seriously deficient for the purpose because of its inconsistent relineation of acceptable verse as well as its curious views about verse-division. Scholars badly need a new authoritative edition to replace the Globe as the source of a superior act-scene-line reference; but this edition (would it could be in old spelling) cannot be contemplated until—among other matters—questions of divided lines are decided in a more authoritative manner than at present. 5 All statistics about short lines can be only approximate because of the various undecided cases whether they are independent or linked and whether verse has been properly relined to produce them. 6 It is a matter of opinion whether the two parts of Tamburlaine contain a single such divided line. The texts of The Massacre at Paris and Faustus have not come down to us in sufficiently trustworthy form to the original to be relied on statistically. 7 Metrists have not fully faced up to the problem whether such examples as this, or of stronger expletives or addresses, should be included in the line albeit hypermetrically, or else given individual-line status as in the Folio here and in WT 443 but not Cor. 1777. There is something to be said for inclusion when the evidence of other dramatists is heeded, with some reference to Marlowe. Even such short addresses as 'My Lord' may also be considered for inclusion. 1 Henry IV needs especially close study in this respect. 8 In theory one could reline Jaques's opening to provide an internal short line: Why who cries out on pride that can therein Taxe any private party: but the Duke's speech would require relining down to a short verse made out of 'They lacke retention' (983). Both, of course, are possible but whether authentic is certainly an open question. If one chose to scan a thirteen-syllable line (with a feminine ending) by an initial foot composed of three unstressed syllables and one stressed, a slurred sort of line could be made out of Menenius' opening; but feet of that nature need to be better understood within pentameters before they can be utilized to slide over difficulties like the present. In the Cymbeline example Imogen's short opening is preceded by a series of short lines, but it appears to be impossible to link these in any manner that would complete a pentameter with 'Great men' or to reline the speech to produce an internal short line later. Menenius' speech might, of course, start with a trochee, followed by three unstressed syllables before the next stressed, these four syllables comprising the second foot. Technically, the line could instead start with a dactyl followed by an anapest, but few would wish to scan it thus. If this is an acceptable pentameter, the compositor could not have set it as one line. However, all observed editors reproduce it as two, as in the Folio. And so with Imogen's speech, which could also be slurred, and perhaps should be one line. 9 For instance, the Globe lines the Folio, misprinted as prose, at II.vi.62-69: Draw lots who shall begin. Antony . That will I Pompey. Pompey . No, Antony, take the lot: but first Or last your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Cæsar Grew fat with feasting there. Antony . You have heard much. Pompey . I have fair meanings, sir. Antony . And fair words to them. Pompey . Then so much have I heard: And I have heard, Apollodorus carried---- The New Arden editor pieces out the Globe's irregular first line for Pompey but then becomes involved in limping rhythms and a tetrameter: Pompey . No Antony, take the lot: but first or last, Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame. I have heard that Julius Cæsar Grew fat with fasting there. Kittredge, Alexander, and New Riverside give Pompey a short independent line: Pompey . No, Antony, take the lot: But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Cæsar Grew fat with feasting there. This solves the metrical problem of Pompey's speech but adds two others, for according to the verse-division both Pompey's 'No, Antony, take the lot' and his later 'Then so much have I heard' are short beginning lines to speeches. In each there is something of a rhetorical shift and one would not be surprised to find either in a situation where it was required, no link being possible. But neither firmly agrees with Shakespeare's most prominent patterns for such lines, and the repetition within a short space is disturbing; hence an arrangement that would remove them would be more desirable than not. It has not been sufficiently observed that editors have created more problems for themselves than solutions by following the usual Globe tendency to link the short closing line of a speech with a short following line, at the expense of then producing a short unlinked opening line of varying degrees of attractiveness. On the contrary, statistics demonstrate the overwhelming preponderance of short unlinked closing lines—a regular Shakespearean pattern—as against the comparative infrequency of short unlinked opening lines. Thus when a choice is possible, the odds greatly favor any arrangement that links an opening line but leaves a closing line undivided. Such an arrangement is possible for the passage, although it would seem that no editor has tried it: Draw lots who shall begin. Antony . That will I Pompey . Pompey . No Anthony take the lot: But first or last, your fine Egyptian cookerie Shall have the fame, I have heard that Julius Cœsar , Grew fat with feasting there. Anthony . You have heard much. Pompey . I have faire meaning Sir Anthony . And faire words to them. Pompey . Then so much have I heard ( Ant. 1252-60). A compromise, although unnecessary, could link 'Grew fat' with 'You have heard much', leaving 'Then so much have I heard' as an opening independent short line. But, for whatever evidence it represents, the Folio punctuation of a comma after 'heard' and its completion of Pompey's main speech entirely as prose suggests that the full rearrangement is to be preferred. 10 Were it not for a truly necessary piece of stage-business, And let us heare Barnado speake of this. Barnardo . Last night of all, When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole ( Ham. 45-47) would qualify as a distinct anomaly. But to distract the audience's attention from the entrance of the Ghost, Bernardo must point to the star. The audience following his extended arm will receive a suitable shock when the Ghost then seems to materialize on the stage without making a mundane entrance. 11 This may not be an authentic case. The Folio lines: Anthony . From Scicion how the newes? Speake there. 1. Messenger . The man from Scicion , Is there such an one? 2. Messenger . He stayes upon your will. Anthony . Let him appeare: . . . Since the measure would hold the 1. Messenger's speech as one line, it may be dangerous to disregard the Folio lining and join the two halves, as do the Globe and all editors, an arrangement that enforces the linking of 'Let him appeare' (which else could stand alone, justified as an independent short line by the change from command to soliloquy) if 'He stayes' were to link with 'Is there such a one'. On the other hand, some considerations make the Globe relining of the 1. Messenger's speech as a single line attractive. Although the division of the line is not enforced by a too short measure, the compositor is manifestly wasting space toward the end of this column, where the interchange occurs, as shown by the extraordinary depth of the white space surrounding the stage-direction just below at 211. Then, no apparent stage-business, change of address, or other moving cause would seem to dictate the division of the two halves of the verse. Finally, the metrics are not ideal for a divided line. The link would require 'Is there such' to be an anapest immediately after a double feminine ending in the preceding line, a considerable cluster of weak syllables, whereas a single pentameter has a two-stress first half with the first stress of the second half falling on 'Is' after a lyric caesura. 12 As in ''Tis certaine then for Cyprus' ( Oth. 374) and 'You are sent for to the Senate' ( Cor. 2987), as cited above. 13 Just possibly the Globe so arranged this divided verse separately because Pompey's answer to Enorbarbus seemed to join the lines more pertinently than Antony's to Pompey. If so, this is fallacious reasoning, for direct exchange need have nothing to do with whether part-lines link or not. 14 We cannot tell whether the Globe lined this passage by chance or under the impression that Oliver's 'Look, he recovers' was prose and hence unlinkable. Before this passage Oliver speaks verse but subsequently, according to the Globe, he then speaks prose. If this were the reason, it is erroneous. The Folio lines Oliver's next address to Rosalind (after Celia's invitation for him to take Ganymede by the arm) as verse: Oliver . Be of good cheere youth: you a man? You lacke a mans heart. Rosalind . I doe so I confesse it: Ah, sirra . . . (2318-20). Prose follows beginning with 'Ah, sirra', answered in prose by Oliver except that in 2334-35 the Folio lines as verse: Oliver . That will I: for I must beare answere backe How you excuse my brother, Rosalind . Oliver's lines here are very likely prose, coming as they do after Rosalind's shift to prose, followed by Celia. But this false verse, if prose it be as we may suppose, should not affect the question of 2318-19, nor should an editor be put off by the fact that 2318 is a tetrameter. In printing Rosalind's 'I doe so I confesse it' as a short line before prose, the Folio indicates that it is intended to link with 'You lacke a mans heart.' Hence the prose does not begin until 'Ah, sirra'. This link has been ignored by editors. 15 This famous passage, and its arrangement, may well represent merely another example of the Globe's strong (and unwarranted) propensity for linking the closing line of a speech with a succeeding short one when an option exists. Instead, the odds favor the closing short as a complete verse. 16 'His Mother and his wife,' can just be fitted into the Folio measure with 2912; hence no bibliographical evidence supports viewing the opening short line as a compositorial device. There is a sufficient even though a not very marked break. 17 Not only the frequency suggests this relationship in a division of a pentameter but also the positions. The short-line ending of one speech followed by the unlinked short-line beginning of the next is uncommon in Shakespeare although a few legitimate examples have been cited above that exhibit special characteristics justifying their existence. 18 A History of English Versification (1910), p. 137. 19 How far contractions can be counted on to be authoritative (especially in a play like Measure for Measure where the scribe Ralph Crane intervenes between the holograph and the printing shop) is sometimes moot. For example: To die for't? Enter Angelo . Angelo . Now, what's the matter Provost ? ( MM 739-741) There shall be order for't. Enter Lucio and Isabella . Provost . 'Save your Honour. (766-768) These part lines must be linked: the only question is if 'for't' is authentic then in the first the caesura substitutes for a stressed and in the second for an unstressed syllable. As another instance, in MM 2448 Duke . The warrant's for your selfe: take heede to't the line may be a tetrameter with a feminine ending, or else a pentameter if one expands 'to't'. In Antony and Cleopatra 1241-43 the expansion of 'ther's' to 'there is' seems required, and in fact may be encouraged by its occurrence in a line that completely fills the measure (the division being editorial), so that the contraction may be compositorial: Cœsar . Since I saw you last, Ther's a change upon you. Pompey . Well, I know not, What counts harsh Fo[r]tune cast's upon my face . . . . 20 For instance, see TGV 2043-62 for short prose interchanges within a pattern of verse speeches. 21 That is, metrically this divided line may be read either as one with a double feminine ending and the caesura substituting for an unstressed syllable, or else with an epic caesura dividing an anapest (if this is possible); yet in either case a limping effect is produced when 'her' is both unstressed and stressed in the same phrase within the same line. The stress is on the same words if the lines are independent. 22 If one had any reason to defend the Globe lining one could point out (what would have been hidden from the Globe editors) that the page is very tightly set, an indication of problems with cast-off copy, and that the compositor could have saved a line by joining the two halves of Antony's speech. But a possibility is not a probability, of course. That this could have occurred does not prove that it did. 23 In another passage from Macbeth the meter seems to indicate the following division I shall be counsail'd. Macbeth . Good repose the while. Banquo . Thankes Sir: the like to you. (608-610) and the fact that 610 is an exit line aids the belief that 609-610 should not be linked, the first half starting with an anapest. 24 It would be ridiculous to suggest that Shakespeare wrote these short lines, or linked them in his mind, according to any predetermined pattern. But changing habits within the flow of blank verse, as well as various quite unassessable rhetorical or other considerations might dictate to him in any specific case one sense of linking as against another. Except for some matters such as the general avoidance of an unlinked short opening line to a speech and sometimes a special treatment of exit lines, Shakespeare's sense of the verse-division might well differ according to no after-the-event discernible pattern, although it is true that certain divisions were more habitual with him than others. Unfortunately, such observable tendencies do not seem to be of a specific enough nature to solve the problem of an utterly ambiguous situation such as Macbeth 1003-5 or MM 2333-36 above, where the basic question is whether to link the first short independent line with the short preceding ending or the second short separate line. We can only assume that in such cases at the moment of writing Shakespeare had an opinion which lines he thought went together. At least the evidence of Ben Jonson's plays indicates that linking was entirely conscious, for Jonson would insist on printing the two halves of a divided verse on the same line, a practice in which he was followed by Massinger. 25 How little what might be called the sense or content of the lines may affect the division is seen in such a typical case as Macbeth I.iii.127-147 (238-262) in which Macbeth's soliloquy links several times with Banquo's comments, yet neither of them hears the other. See also Mac. 1013-15 above. 26 Schipper, p. 231, allows the caesura to substitute for a whole foot so that a normal tetrameter may be considered to be a pentameter. This reasoning is difficult to follow once one admits that Shakespeare for a special purpose (usually for an abrupt termination of some line of thought or address) does write internal lines of less than five feet within a pentameter passage. That is, if the verse is regularly iambic so that the caesura comes after the second iamb, the distinction vanishes between a tetrameter and an assumed pentameter with suppression of a foot. If, instead, the caesura suppresses the arsis, the pattern is quite different since the unstressed iambic syllable of a lyric caesura is present in the first half, and only one syllable (the stressed) that follows has been suppressed. Moreover, Schipper's examples are suspect: JC V.iii.32 merely ends a speech with a normal tetrameter and to try to stretch it to a pentameter would be absurd. Mac. I.ii.7 is an illegitimate example since it merely suppresses the arsis and not a whole foot. 27 Still another arrangement is possible although it cannot be seriously put forward: Menenius . You have made good worke[,] you and your cry. Shal's to the Capitoll? Cominius . Oh I, what else? Exeunt both . Menenius' line would need to start with a truncated iamb, minus its first syllable. 28 Including the speech-prefix, Prospero's full line is too long to have fitted in the measure and needed to be broken by the compositor. Hence the Folio lining can be explained, if necessary. The case for JC 273-276 and its common editorial rearrangement is less bibliographically explicable than Temp . 427-431. The page is loosely set and any division would have been possible. On the other hand, 'That my weake words have strucke but thus much shew' is too long for the measure. Not every Folio mislining is bibliographically (or rationally) explicable, of course. If JC requires relining here, an editor may appeal to the common compositorial error of running in extra words after a short line, perhaps owing to some problems with the manuscript inscription. But the case for relining, though good is far from certain. Everything really rests on the serious difficulty of the divided hexameter in a situation in which the resulting short opening line should not represent a verse. 29 A difficulty here is that there is no problem with the measure, as in Prospero's line, to justify rearrangement. However, much of the mislineation in Coriolanus , which constitutes a serious editorial problem, seems to have been caused by some other factor than the width of the measure. 30 That is, unless 'What?' is made into a short, sharp, single line. For a similar case, see TGV 31-32, below, lined by modern editors as a divided verse. 31 The catchword is ' Ang. That', more likely a misreading than a sign that the continued text somehow differed from that in the manuscript as a reason for the lineation problem. 32 The page (sig. 2l1) is loosely set. Moreover, the measure would have held 'For Brutus sake he findes himselfe beholding' if it had been present in the manuscript (thus making of the linked line a pentameter with suppression of the arsis). In short, no physical reason exists why the compositor should not have set the arrangement that he saw in his copy. 33 Hexameters create a special problem because so many apparent ones may in effect be viewed as loose pentameters, as widely illustrated by E. A. Abbott, A Shakespearian Grammar (1871), §§ 493-499, who believes that true alexandrines are comparatively rare in Shakespeare. (However, many of Abbott's scansions would not be accepted today.) Lines that respond to the contraction of auxiliaries ( AYL 1846), articles ( Ant. 2272), some prepositions ( 1H6 1217), and the like ( WT 1164-65) (Abbott, § 456), or lines with double feminine endings (§§ 458, 494), present no difficulty of course. But from sufficient examples of less amenable verses it may seem that Shakespeare either wrote a larger number of hexameters (if regularly scanned) than is probable or else that on occasion he was prepared to accept as a poetic foot a stressed syllable preceded by three unstressed syllables. However, even though it may scan strictly as a hexameter, when we have an epic caesura (the pause after one extra weak syllable) followed by an anapest beginning the second half, the line may pass without comment as an intended pentameter (see Mac. 2257-60 above), whether undivided as in 'Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius ' ( JC 799), or else divided. (This suggested scansion may seem superior to one with a caesura preceded by two weak syllables followed by a series of trochees beginning with 'but'.) So also with a normal line but with a double feminine ending (or single with slurring) like 'Our purpose Necessary, and not Envious' ( JC 811). Only slightly more troublesome is a line like 'Joyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers' ( H5 797), since 'enemy' can be elided to a dissyllable or quite naturally slurred as in a sense a Jonsonian apostrophus. (Again, this scansion seems superior to a four-stress first half and a one-stress second half composed of a single foot of three unstressed and one one-stress syllables.) The above are simple examples; but how far we should go in slurring to create a pentameter from a twelve-syllable line that could be an alexandrine if regularly scanned is the really debatable question on which opinions may well differ. One may suggest that the oral slurring (or elision) of 'to be' to the single syllable 't'be' in 'That seeming to be most, which we indeed least are' ( Shr. 2733) is superior to creating the anomalous foot of three unstressed and one stressed syllables from 'ing to be'. (Since this line forms a couplet with its predecessor 2732, it ought not to be a hexameter, as Abbott, p. 400, points out; nevertheless, see R2 976-977 for just such a couplet.) But a line like 'And these does she apply, for warnings and portents' ( JC 1073) may be more troublesome if Abbott, p. 402. is correct that 'portents' with the stress on the second syllable represents 'the Shakespearian accent'. The choice would seem to be between slurring (or eliding) 'does she' to one syllable or accepting a final foot composed of 'ings and portents' with three unstressed syllables, unless one could slur the 'ings' ending, perhaps uncomfortably. Similarly, "Supposition, all our lives, shall be stucke full of eyes' ( 1H4 2790) seems to require a foot of three unstressed syllables and a stressed in 'tion, all our lives', and so do lines like 'Do somthing mingle with our yonger brown, yet ha we' ( Ant. 2673), and probably 'The rest shall beare the businesse in some other fight' ( Cor. 703) whether or not relined to shift the problem to 702. Similarly, no matter how lined, it is difficult without excessive slurring to scan ' Hyperion to a Satyre: so loving to my Mother' ( Ham. 324) without such a foot, or 'Coy looks, with hart-sore sighes: one fading moments mirth' ( TGV 34). Such occasional Fletcherian looseness in Shakespeare's undivided lines may perhaps encourage an editor to accept more linked verses than he might otherwise wish, when an anomalous short opening line of a speech can thereby be avoided. Whether the odds favor the same flexibility when the linking of single independent lines is in question either with the short concluding line of a preceding speech or with each other is moot. Even in the first category some delicate decisions would be required. For instance, in MM 744-745, 748-749, 751-752, it may be considered good evidence that three successive interchanges, if linked, would need special dispensations of one sort or another, whereas something can be said for the ability of each short beginning line to stand alone according to an acceptable Shakespearean pattern, which I personally believe is the correct lining, despite the linking of the final exchange in 754-755. 34 The Globe and most editors do not attempt to link any of the lines in these four examples, except for the New Arden which arbitrarily makes a divided trimeter of 'change? | The matter?' 35 The main reason is that no matter how the line is scanned as a pentameter, different stresses fall on the two occurrences of 'pity her'. For instance, if a line were formed with a lyric caesura after the first foot, the first 'her' would be accented but the second awkwardly stressed. On the other hand, also awkward, if the caesura comes at the end of stressed 'her' as the second iamb, and the caesura substitutes for an unstressed syllable, then 'pity her' is a feminine ending with unstressed 'her'. 36 Taking only the regular syllabic metrical beat, the line is an acceptable pentameter with lyric caesura and feminine ending. If the stresses are rhetorical, however, the line could be read as a hexameter unless one were to count 'How? I' as a single foot, a spondee. Despite the temptation to regard this passage as consisting of five short independent lines, the linking of 1732-33 might be encouraged by the definite link in preceding 1730-31. 37 Antony's pentameter can be read as an anapest and four iambs or else as a trochee, dactyl, and three iambs. Lepidus' answering pentameter has the same choice. 38 To end an exit or a scene with an unlinked short line is a favorite device but by no means a majority usage. In Macbeth , rather curiously if the expedient is Shakespeare's, a concluding couplet may be followed by an unlinked and unrhymed independent short line. 39 An analogy would be Macbeth 410-413, the divided verse correctly arranged in the Folio: The future in the instant. Macbeth . My dearest Love, Duncan comes here to Night. Lady . And when goes hence? However, it should be noted that double linkage is an argument in favor of dividing a pentameter single line only in such a case as 1116-19 above or to avoid an anomalous short beginning separate line. It is an entirely inadequate reason when such double linkage does not produce full pentameters. For an example of the Globe's tinkering, see its division of the Folio pentameter 'And affecting one sole throne, without assistance' in Cor. 2930-34 above when the first half of the new verse 'Without assistance' links only with difficulty with 'I thinke not so.' 40 However, see footnote 11 above for a not entirely satisfactory alternative to the arguably correct Globe joining of two part-lines in Ant. 205-206 to form a single pentameter verse.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Fielding Discovery, with Some Remarks on the Canon by M. C. with R. R. Battestin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In June 1739, in order to secure evidence for an action of libel, agents of the Walpole ministry raided the offices of the printer and editor of the Opposition organ, Common Sense , and seized their papers. Of these, 218 autograph items, the great majority representing copy for the printer, are preserved together at the Public Record Office (Chancery Lane)—call number: SP9/35. Since this collection by no means comprises a complete run of the printer's copy to the time of seizure, and since—no doubt for prudential reasons—none of the copy is signed, scholars will find this material of limited use in identifying contributors, though, by a comparative analysis of the handwriting, it is a simple matter to distinguish, in a general way, articles written by the editor from those submitted by occasional correspondents to the journal. Included among these papers, however, is at least one item of exceptional interest; for here, in the form of a pseudonymous letter to the editor recommending silence as "the utmost Perfection of human Wisdom," is the only extant literary prose manuscript by Henry Fielding. Signed "Mum Budget" and dated from Devon on April Fool's Day 1738, this witty piece, though published in Common Sense on 13 May, has never been attributed to Fielding. It is valuable, however, not only as an important addition to the canon, representing one of Fielding's earliest known publications as a periodical essayist, the form in which—as editor of The Champion (1739-41), The True Patriot (1745-46), The Jacobite's Journal (1747-48), and The Covent-Garden Journal (1752)—he would soon outshine every rival for a decade. What is more, appearing in the midst of the two-and-a-half-year interval between the passage of the Theatrical Licensing Act (June 1737), which put an end to his career as a dramatist, and the publication of The Champion (November 1739), when he emerged as principal journalist for the Opposition, the essay sheds light on Fielding's personal circumstances and political relationships in one of the most obscure periods of his life. Because literary manuscripts by Fielding are so rare 1 —and because this, indeed, is the only one extant which he intended as printer's copy—I will reproduce it here photographically, as well as supplying an annotated transcript for more convenient reference. Fully to appreciate its implications, both political and biographical, we need first, however, to review the circumstances in which Fielding wrote it. Sponsored by his friends in Opposition, Common Sense: or, The Englishman's Journal began publication on 5 February 1737, during Fielding's final season as manager of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket. In a month's time, with the production of The Historical Register , he would cap the brilliant success of Pasquin a year earlier—a triumph no less spectacular than it was disastrous in its consequences for his career as a playwright; for, though Fielding's satire in these plays spared neither party, it linked him in the public mind with the Opposition's cause and moved the Ministry to silence him. As one ministerial writer was well assured, Fielding's success with Pasquin had caused him to be "secretly buoy'd up , by some of the greatest Wits and finest Gentlemen of the Age" 2 —among them, surely, Lyttelton and Chesterfield, who had now initiated the new journal. Its editor and principal writer, however, was the Irishman, Charles Molloy (d. 1767), himself a comic dramatist manqué and, as the former author of Fog's Weekly Journal (1728-37), a journalist well skilled in the art of making ministerial politicians die sweetly in print. Its printer was the inflexible Tory, John Purser. In a sense Fielding, too, was associated with this paper from the start; for its title had been borrowed from the "emblematical" figure whose "Tragedy" is rehearsed, to hilarious effect, in the final acts of Pasquin . Though in Pasquin Common Sense suffered what might seem her inevitable fate in the age of Walpole, in the pages of Molloy's weekly paper, presumably, she would live on, with due acknowledgments to Fielding, who understood her best: "An ingenious Dramatick Author," we are reminded in the first issue, "has consider'd Common Sense as so extraordinary a Thing, that he has lately, with great Wit and Humour, not only personified it, but dignified it too with the Title of a Queen . . . ." A few months later, when Fielding needed a "Vehicle" by which to answer a ministerial attack against the alleged licentiousness of his political satire in The Historical Register , it was, predictably, Molloy who provided it. 3 As C. W. Nichols saw some time ago, the letter signed "Pasquin" published in Common Sense for 21 May 1737 is certainly by Fielding, an attribution Molloy himself confirms, albeit obliquely, in his leader of 21 October 1738. 4 That Fielding, especially after the Licensing Act had put a stop to his play writing, might contribute other pieces to his friends' journal has always seemed likely. W. L. Cross, for instance, wished to assign to him a pair of essays treating affectation as the source of ridicule, which were published in Common Sense (3, 10 September 1737); and a recent anthologist of Fielding's criticism has considered Cross's suggestion plausible enough to justify reprinting them. 5 But these essays, though the opening of the first does bear some resemblance to Fielding's definition of "the true Ridiculous" in the Preface to Joseph Andrews (1742), are stylistically quite different from his usual manner; and unlike his known contributions to the journal, they take the form of leaders, not pseudonymous letters to the editor—a circumstance suggesting that they are by someone (Chesterfield is the usual candidate) whose connection with the paper was closer and more regular than Fielding's. Unfortunately, the manuscripts of these essays, which would settle such speculation, have not survived; but Cross's reasons for attributing them to Fielding are not persuasive. We may take it as certain, I believe, that after the "Pasquin" letter almost precisely a year went by before Fielding made his next appearance in Common Sense , this time as that wonderfully garrulous advocate of the wisdom of holding one's tongue, "Mum Budget." The essay begins, accordingly, with his anticipating the editor's surprise "at not hearing from me in so long time." Besides making an amusing addition to the canon, this piece is of considerable interest biographically, for what it reveals both of Fielding's own sense of the events that precipitated the Licensing Act, and of his hardening attitude toward Sir Robert Walpole, whose patronage he once had courted. 6 Indeed, to those who care about the kind of man Fielding was, one of the essay's special pleasures derives from its tone: that he could make a joke of the hard blow the minister had dealt him—by thus writing a witty tour de force on the wisdom of keeping one's mouth shut in Walpole's England—is part of what one finds so admirable in his character. For, as is evident here for the first time, Fielding was himself convinced that, whatever may have been its general utility to the government, the Licensing Act had been pushed through Parliament specifically to muzzle him, and that, whatever other plays may have annoyed the prime minister, it was the satiric characterization of him as Quidam in The Historical Register which proved to be the last offending straw. After a long and humorous preamble, the essay from this point takes the political turn for which, no doubt, it was chiefly written. The yarn about the whimsical "Coffee House Politician" who was so fond of silence that he bribed others "to hold their Tongue" and who by such means became "the Oracle of the House" is, of course, a transparent allegory of Walpole. The old gentleman's habit of urging "weighty Motions concerning Tobacco, Coffee, &amp;c. " recalls the prime minister's unpopular Excise Scheme of 1733, 7 as his way of fainting "at the Sound of a Musquet" ridicules his pacific policies toward Spain at a time when " Spanish Depradations" against English ships were a constant theme of the Opposition press and in March 1738 the burden of petitions presented to Parliament by aggrieved merchants. 8 His droll indulgence of the inane and loquacious waiter, " young Will ," is a hit, surely, at Walpole's "creature," Sir William Yonge (1693-1755), no less "notorious a Babbler" in "the House," who at the time was consolidating his reputation for meaningless eloquence in speeches supporting the minister's foreign policy. 9 Clearly, however even-handed Fielding had earlier tried to be in his political satires, he was ready now to take sides against Walpole and his ministry. This essay is his first in a vein that, late in the following year, would become familiar to readers of The Champion . The discovery of this manuscript, of course, makes the possibility all the more attractive that Fielding made other contributions to Common Sense during the eighteen months that would pass before he launched his own paper in behalf of the Opposition. Textually, the relationship between the manuscript and the two printed versions of the essay—that of the original issue of Common Sense (13 May 1738) and that appearing in the two-volume reprint (1738-39)—reveals, however, certain peculiarities which complicate the problem of identifying Fielding's hand elsewhere in the journal. Most significant of these is the fact that, in setting the article, the compositor systematically, and without editorial authority, altered a characteristic of Fielding's style which has long served as an indispensable test for anyone proposing additions to the canon: in every instance Fielding's favorite archaism, the use of hath for has , has been modernized. And presumably his doth 's would have been similarly treated if he had had occasion to use that verb in the essay. To compound the problem, it is clear that this particular sophistication was not a feature of Purser's "house style": the printed versions of the "Pasquin" letter retain Fielding's characteristic usage. Indeed, Molloy himself often (though not invariably) prefers the same archaisms. These changes from the manuscript, therefore, would seem to be an expression of the stylistic taste of a particular compositor—who, since he was no doubt employed at other times by Purser, may be supposed to have treated other essays in the same manner. What this practice means to anyone looking for signs of Fielding's authorship in the published numbers of Common Sense is obvious: we cannot now automatically exclude an essay from consideration merely because it shows has and does where Fielding would have used hath and doth . Inspection of the manuscript, and collation of the manuscript with the printed versions, reveal two other sources of possible confusion. Molloy, for instance, was not above tampering with Fielding's phrasing when, to his by no means infallible ear, it seemed infelicitous. Thus in the second sentence of the manuscript Fielding's forceful declaration "that the utmost Perfection of human Wisdom is Silence" is padded out by Molloy to read, "that the utmost Perfection that human Wisdom is capable of attaining to is, Silence"—a pointless adulteration of the original which I have ignored in transcribing the essay. Another such revision occurs at the end of the first sentence of the penultimate paragraph, where Molloy obliterated Fielding's own phrase and substituted the words "maintained in It as long as he lived." Happily, Molloy did not take many such liberties with Fielding's text. Even so, this essay in its published form presents an additional, if no doubt minor, hazard to anyone trying to weigh its claims to be Fielding's work: we would be right in supposing that Fielding could not have written the feeble phrase in the first example above, but we would be wrong to infer therefore that Fielding had not written the essay as a whole. And finally, anyone seeking Fielding's traces in the pages of the two-volume reprint of Common Sense may expect to encounter numerous pitfalls of another sort. For, though the essay as originally published includes Molloy's revisions as well as a number of errors committed by the compositor, who in several places misread the manuscript, the version in the reprint is more imperfect still; besides preserving the faults of the original issue, it introduces others of its own, including the deletion of four entire phrases. For these reasons, then, the task of identifying Fielding's hand in the published numbers of Common Sense cannot be undertaken very confidently. Without the hath-doth test to rely on, we have lost one simple means of narrowing the range of possibilities. The manuscripts preserved at the Public Record Office are, of course, a considerable help toward this end, and in some instances may serve to chasten the rash: if, for example, we set aside the hath-doth test, the leader published in the journal on 30 September 1738—an ironic allegory of corruption in English society written in the form of a "Letter from Common Honesty to Common Sense"—sounds rather like Fielding; but, as the manuscript proves, he was not the author. 10 And what about the issue of 23 December 1738, in which the author anticipates the satiric analogy between Walpole and Jonathan Wild which Fielding would develop at length in his novel? If, like W. R. Irwin, 11 we had resisted the temptation to attribute this leader to Fielding chiefly because it fails the hath test, we may wish now to have another, closer look; the manuscript, unfortunately, has not been preserved. I doubt, however, that this is Fielding's work: though the basic device of the satire is identical with that of Jonathan Wild —and represents, moreover, the earliest known instance of the analogy after its original occurrence in Mist's Weekly Journal (12, 19 May 1725)—yet Fielding could not have developed the idea in so dogged a manner, and his humor, needless to say, is never so lifeless and heavy-handed. A more playful piece that might well be his is the clever satire of Theophilus Cibber ( Common Sense , 19 May 1739) which takes the form of a brazen, hectoring epistle, partly in verse, from "Pistol" to the editor—"Pistol" being, of course, Fielding's name for Theophilus Cibber in Tumble-Down Dick (1736) and The Historical Register , where he is made to strut and rant in a similar vein. 12 But again, there is no manuscript to confirm the attribution. Since all the extant manuscripts of the journal antedate 27-28 June 1739, when Walpole's agents confiscated them, 13 they offer no clues to the authorship of any essays published after that time. In my opinion, however, Fielding did make at least one, and quite possibly two, further contributions to Common Sense during the period before The Champion began publication on 15 November. On 15 September Molloy devoted his front page to two witty and learned letters from, ostensibly, two anonymous correspondents. The first is a political piece which begins with a friendly caveat to the editor—"The Restraint, or Excise, which Wit may some Time or other suffer, will confine the Use of it altogether to Manuscripts or Discourse; and even then, the Use of it may lead its Owner into great Inconveniencies, if he has not the Art to check it, or let it loose with Judgment and Discretion"—and proceeds through references to Tacitus and Juvenal, Bacon and Ralegh, to apply the lessons of history to present politics, most particularly to the consequences of corruption and luxury in high places and to the threat ministerial "Whisperers" post to freedom of expression. The second is on a moral theme, being the droll complaint of a man who has pored over many books hoping in vain that the wisdom of the ancients might cure him of his favorite vices—" Talkativeness " and " Intemperance in eating and drinking ." Both these letters show has and does instead of Fielding's usual archaisms; but, with some reservations about the first, I believe they are his work. Certainly, as the "Mum Budget" essay attests, few others at this time could speak more feelingly, or with such humor and playful erudition, about the "great Inconveniencies" authors might suffer owing to the "Restraint, or Excise," on "Wit" in Walpole's England. And again, with "Mum Budget's" views on the wisdom of silence in mind, there is, at least, a witty symmetry worthy of Fielding in this new piece on talkativeness from a man who, though he has "a thousand Precepts in [his] Budget against going too far," finds them all sadly ineffectual. Might we not see these two letters, treating political and moral matters in that humorous way so characteristic of Fielding's manner in The Champion , as a sort of preliminary exercise calculated to demonstrate his qualifications for conducting a periodical paper of his own? However that may be, I do believe he wrote them. Proving he did is a very different matter of course, perhaps for another occasion. What follows is an annotated transcript of the manuscript in the Public Record Office (Chancery Lane)—call number: SP9/35, items 215-16. The manuscript itself, comprising two folio sheets (12½ by 7¾ inches) with writing on both sides, is photographically reproduced in the plates accompanying this article. In preparing the transcript, I have tried to convey a sense of Fielding's original intentions. Whenever I was confident that I could distinguish these from the changes introduced by Molloy as he edited the copy, I have disregarded the latter in order to restore Fielding's own phrasing and his own practice with respect to the accidentals, particularly paragraphing. Unfortunately, though it is comparatively easy to distinguish between author and editor in substantive matters—Molloy's hand being quite different from Fielding's— it is virtually impossible to do so in the case of pointing. Elsewhere, in his correspondence, Fielding tends toward minimal punctuation; 14 but he may well have followed a different practice when marking copy for publication—and since the present manuscript is the only such copy by him which has survived, there is no basis for comparison. Some decisions affecting capitalization—especially the capitalization of nouns— were also difficult, since the form Fielding gives certain letters is constant, whether he intends them for upper or lower case: this is true of his m , o , s , u , v , w , and occasionally his a. When he means to capitalize these letters he simply writes them larger; and size being a relative thing, his intention is not always clear. In doubtful cases, therefore, I have followed his normal practice of capitalizing substantive nouns. Finally, in annotating the essay, I have not glossed biographical or political matters when these have been dealt with above. * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">M r Common Sense. I believe you may have wondered at not hearing from me in so long time, and will, perhaps, be more surprized at the Reason I am going to give you.—In short, Sir, I am at length thoroughly convinced, that the utmost Perfection of human Wisdom is Silence; 1 and that when a Man hath learnt to hold his Tongue, he may be properly said to have arrived at the highest Pitch of Philosophy. I am so very fond of this virtue, that I shall do a kind of violence to it (for Silence implies holding the Pen as well as the Tongue) to trumpet forth it s Praises, seeing that, upon much deep Reflection, I am persuaded, if any Virtue hath had that universal Assent W ch M r Lock seems to deny, 2 it must be allowed to be this. Solomon , the wisest of Men, declares loudly in Commendation of this virtue. In the multitude of Words , says he, there wanteth not Sin: but he that refraineth his Lips is wise . again,— he that hath Knowledge spareth his words . and 3 again, Even a Fool, when he holdeth his Lips, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his Lips is esteemed a Man of Understanding . 4 and in several other Places throughout his Proverbs. King David is so fond of Silence, that he applauds himself for abstaining even from good words ; which, tho' it seems it was extremely troublesome to him, yet he was so resolute in his Perseverance in this virtue, that rather than let a word go from him he was determined to put a Bridle , or, as I have seen it rendered from the Hebrew, a Muzzle on his Mouth. 5 The Stoicks, the greatest, wisest and most virtuous of all the Sects of Heathen Philosophers, 6 had this virtue in such Estimation, that it is well known what a long Silence was necessary to qualify a Graduate in their Schools: 7 —whether these great Men imagined, as some have insinuated, that Wisdom, like good Ale, ripened and refined it self by being well corked, I will not decide; or whether they might not, with greater Justice observe, that Wisdom, like Air, being stopped in one place would naturally find a vent in another, and so, by keeping the Mouth close shut, infuse itself into the Muscles of the Face, and thereby create what we call a wise Look, a Quality ever held in great Esteem, and of singular good use in all Philosophical Societies. Homer , a Poet of deep Penetration, to give his Reader a vast Idea of the wisdom of the Greeks , makes particular mention of the profound Silence in which their Army marched. oὶ δ'αρ ισαν σιγη μενεα πνειονΤες Aχαιοι. 8 But, indeed, such are the Honours which Antiquity hath conferred on this admirable Quality, that I may say, with Cicero , si velim omnia percurrere Dies deficeret ; 9 I shall therefore confine my self, in the Residue of this Letter, to my own Country, which, I can with Pleasure observe to have been inferiour to no other in her Esteem of Silence. To begin with our Philosophers,—The Spectator , whom the French call Le Socrate moderne , 10 was so perfect an Observer of Silence, that he assures us he seldom proceeded farther in Conversation than to a Monosyllable; that he had often, among Persons not thoroughly acquainted with him, passed by the name of the Dumb Man: to which I need not add the great Ceremony &amp; Difficulty with which his Mouth was once publickly opened, as it is so universally known. 11 In a Word, he seems to value himself more on his Taciturnity than his Eloquence, and, notwithstanding the universal Applause his Works procured him, seems to have taken to himself more Merit from what he had not said, than what he had. 2dly, it is well remembered, that somewhat less than 100 years ago Silence had obtained so much Ground in our Religious Meetings, That the secret, silent Breathings of the Spirit diffused themselves all over the Nation, some notable Remains of which we have at this Day among the People called Quakers;—the Profoundness of whose silent Meetings I have often beheld with great Pleasure, nor can I help observing here the Insinuation of a certain reverend Dean, in a serious Essay of his, that true Christianity hath been put to Silence some time ago among us. 12 But this Virtue blossoms no where so much as among the Politicians.—A certain ludicrous Poet, in a Piece called the Historical Register , wherein he introduced several Politicians on the Stage, gives this Character of Silence to the chief of them; 13 but I am afraid in so doing, he did not act very politickly for himself: for I have observed, that his Muse hath been silent ever since. I have heard of a Coffee House Politician, who, by long Study and deep Attention to the Art of Politicks, hath contracted as great a Fondness for Silence as ever Don Quixotte had for Knight Errantry. It is reported of this whimsical Person, that he would bribe Persons to hold their Tongue. I have heard, that if any Fellow attempted to make a Noise in the Coffee House he was sure to have a Sum 14 of the old Gentleman, to procure his future Silence; which, they tell me, produced some comical Events. As Mankind are generally apt, in their Opinions, to pay great Regard to the value the Person sets on himself, and to esteem the Beauty of Women and Wit of men in proportion to the Difficulty which attends their Enjoyment: so this Old Gentleman, by his great Parsimony of Words, at last procured such a veneration for every thing he uttered, that my Grandfather, in whose Time he lived, hath assured me that, on his offering to open his Mouth, the whole Audience have attended as if Friar Bacon 's brazen Head had been on the Table. 15 In short, this Gentlemen [sic] (whose Profession was that of a Haberdasher of small Wares) 16 acquired at last such a Reputation in the Coffee-House by his Taciturnity (for my Grandfather says he can attribute it to nothing else,) that no one ever spoke but himself; &amp; being now become the Oracle of the House, he used to make certain weighty Motions concerning Tobacco, Coffee, &amp;c. and when no one answered him, he always ordered accordingly, pronouncing with a grave Accent, Silence gives Consent. But if we search narrowly into these Characters, which the French call outrez, we may commonly discover in them Contradictions equal to their Absurdities: for this old Fellow, who had so violent an Antipathy to some Noises, had as great a Fondness for others. Thus he is said to have been a passionate Admirer of a Drum, 17 at the same time that he always fainted at the Sound of a Musquet; and his Antipathy to the human Organs, themselves, was not without some Particularity, and, indeed, seems to have been not so much to the Sounds as to the Ideas they conveyed: of which I have heard the following Instance: One of the Waiters at the Coffee-House, whom they called young Will , was so notorious a Babbler, that it was generally thought the old Gentleman abovesaid would have insisted on his being turned away; but what was their Surprize, when they beheld him clap young Will on the Back &amp; tip him Sixpence, crying out, That's my good Boy , for tho' thou talkest more than any Body, no Man can accuse thee of having ever said any thing. So much for this old Coffee-House Politician: but pray, M r Common-Sense , will you be so good to inform us, who live at this Distance, whether any of this Gentleman's Successors are yet living; whether there reigns as great 18 Silence in the Coffee-Houses [sic] at present as this Gentleman maintaind in It as long as he lived. 19 There was a great Noise some time ago concerning Spanish Depradations, which we did not like.—I do assure you, Sir, as great an Enemy as I am to Noise, I should not be displeased at the Musick of a few Broad Sides: methinks, I could h[ea]r 20 you with Pleasure on that Head; for if we are quite silent at home, it is probable we may hear on both Sides our Ears from abroad: but sure we may have better Expectations from the glorious Warmth of our King, and the ready Zeal of his Parl t to support him therein. After this, no silent Steps are to be apprehended, and therefore I shall be silent on that Head. But it is now time for me to relapse into my usual Silence, therefore, after having congratulated you on y r prudent speaking but once a Week, while the Gazeteer chatters every day, I shall, in a silent Manner, assure you, I am Y r most humble Serv t , Mum Budget 21 Devon, 1 April, 1738.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The only other extant literary MSS by Fielding are the two autograph poems (written c. 1729 and 1733) discovered by Isobel Grundy among the papers of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: see "New Verse by Henry Fielding," PMLA , 87 (1972), 213-245. 2 See the letter from "An Adventurer in Politicks," in the Daily Gazetteer (7 May 1737). 3 In an article forthcoming in Modern Philology , Thomas Lockwood persuasively argues for Fielding's authorship of an essay entitled, "Some Thoughts on the present State of the Theatres, and the Consequences of an Act to destroy the Liberty of the Stage," published in the Daily Journal (25 March 1737) in the series called "The Occasional Prompter." Since this series was specifically devoted to theatrical affairs, Fielding presumably considered it the most appropriate forum for expressing his views on such subjects. With this issue, however, "The Occasional Prompter" ceased its run, the Daily Journal itself coming to an end on 9 April. I am grateful to Prof. Lockwood for sharing his important discovery with me. 4 See "Fielding Notes," MLN , 34 (1919), esp. 222-224. That Molloy wrote the leader in question is clear from the MS, which is in his hand (PRO: SP9/35, items 25-26). Molloy clinches the attribution by assigning to a "Poet" who in the context can only be Fielding, "Pasquin's" concluding simile comparing ridicule to the operations of " Ward's Pill." Cf. also Tom Jones (VIII.ix), on self-interest: "This is indeed a most excellent Medicine, and like Ward's Pill, flies at once to the particular Part of the Body on which you desire it to operate, whether it be the Tongue, the Hand, or any other Member, where it scarce ever fails of immediately producing the desired Effect" (eds. Battestin and Bowers [1975], p. 442). The "Pasquin" letter is conveniently reprinted in R. Paulson and T. Lockwood, eds. Henry Fielding: The Critical Heritage (1969), pp. 102-105; and I. Williams, ed. The Criticism of Henry Fielding (1970), pp. 23-26. 5 See Cross, The History of Henry Fielding (1918), I, 334 and n., III, 301; and Williams, op. cit. , pp. 325-334. 6 The best discussion of this subject is in B. A. Goldgar, Walpole and the Wits: The Relation of Politics to Literature, 1722-42 (1976). 7 See William Coxe, Memoirs of the Life and Administration of Sir Robert Walpole (1800), II, 182ff. 8 Ibid. , III, 31ff. 9 Ibid. , III, 38. The article on Yonge in the DNB provides a good summary of the qualities Fielding satirizes. An M.P. from Devon, where "Mum Budget" also resides, he was appointed Secretary at War in 1735. Walpole, it is said, "'caressed him without loving him and employed him without trusting him.'" He had a universal reputation as an unprincipled tool of the minister and as one who, in Chesterfield's words, " by a fitness of tongue raised himself successively to the best appointments in the kingdom." As Paul Whitehead characterizes him in The State Dunces (1733), however, Yonge's speeches were as empty as they were glib: Silence! ye Senates, while enribon'd Y[ong]e Pours forth melodious Nothings from his Tongue! How sweet the Accents play around the Ear, Form'd of smooth Periods, and of well-turn'd Air! (p. 14) Perhaps an even better gloss for Fielding's sketch of him is this from Lord Hervey's Memoirs : "He had no wit in private conversation, but was remarkably quick in taking hints to harangue upon in parliament; he had a knack of words there that was surprising considering how little use they were to him anywhere else. He had a great command of parliamentary language, and a talent of talking eloquently without a meaning, and expatiating agreeably upon nothing." 10 PRO: SP9/35, items 142-148. 11 The Making of " Jonathan Wild ", Columbia University Studies in English and Comparative Literature, No. 153 (1941), p. 117, n. 142. 12 Theophilus Cibber was known for his characterization of Shakespeare's Pistol ( Henry IV ), and from 1733-34, when he led the revolt of the actors at Drury Lane, he was often caricatured under that name. (See An Apology for the Life of Mr. T [ heophilus ] C [ ibber ], Comedian [1740], pp. 16-17.) In The Historical Register , Act II, Cibber as "Pistol" is thus introduced at the head of a mob, whom he harangues in the "Sublime" style, or rather in a ranting burlesque of heroic blank verse; in Act III he bullies his father, Ground-Ivy, this time in couplets. The characterization of "Pistol" in the letter to Common Sense is quite similar to Fielding's conception of him in the farce. That "Pistol" writes his letter from " King's Coffee-House, Covent Garden ," seems to support the case for Fielding's authorship: in Tumble-Down Dick that disreputable resort is also the setting for the dance of rakes and whores who burlesque the pantomimes at Drury Lane, where "Pistol" was now acting manager. The specific occasion for the satire in Common Sense , however, was political rather than theatrical: rumor had it that Theophilus Cibber had recently assumed a new role and was scribbling Gazetteers in defense of Walpole. For the general background, as well as a comment specifically on this letter, see the Apology , Ch. IX. 13 The agents, Janus Brettell and Jonathan Wiggs, endorsed item 65 v as follows: "Out of M r Purser's back Parlour where he does his Bussiness 27 th June 1739." Item 63 carries a similar endorsement: "June y e 28 1739 / Out of a Trunk upon the two pair of Stairs head / Mr. Molloys papers"; see also items 61, 182. Presumably referring to these seizures, Molloy made the following announcement in Common Sense (7 July 1739): " The Printer of this Paper having receiv'd an unseasonable Visit last Week,—what was design'd for the Entertainment of the Publick this Week hath been lost . . . ." What caused the raids appears to have been the leader of 23 June, which openly accused the members of Parliament of corruption and Walpole of corrupting them—and which, by the way, concludes by comparing the prime minister and his party to Wild and his gang. 14 See, for instance, the transcripts of his correspondence with the Duke of Bedford and his agent, in the Appendix to M. C. and R. R. Battestin, "Fielding, Bedford, and the Westminster Election of 1749," ECS , 11 (1978), 175-182. 1 Perfection . . . Silence] Molloy revised this to read, "Perfection that human Wisdom is capable of attaining to is, Silence". 2 Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690), I, iii ("No Innate Practical Principles"). Locke here demonstrates that no one "moral rule" can claim "universal assent." 3 and] In marking the passage for paragraphing, Molloy deleted this word. 4 Proverbs 10:19, 17:27-8. 5 Psalms 39:1-2. 6 Cf. Thomas Tickell in Spectator , No. 634 (17 December 1714), who calls the Stoics "the most virtuous Sect of Philosophers." 7 Fielding apparently confuses the Stoics with the disciples of Pythagoras, who, according to Diogenes Laertius, required that his scholars prepare themselves as philosophers by keeping silent for five years ( Lives of Eminent Philosophers , VIII, 10). Addison speaks of their "Apprenticeship of Silence" in Spectator , No. 550 (1 December 1712), to which Fielding alludes later in this essay. See also Thomas Stanley, History of Philosophy , 3rd ed. (1701), pp. 358, 372; and André Dacier, Life of Pythagoras (1707), pp. 24-26. 8 Iliad , III.8: "But the Achaeans came on in silence, breathing fury . . ." (trans. A. T. Murray, Loeb Classical Library, 1946). 9 "The day would be too short if I wished to run through them all." Fielding apparently paraphrases Cicero's De Natura Deorum , III, xxxii, 81: "Dies deficiat si velim enumerare . . . ." With the present passage, compare The Covent-Garden Journal (7 January 1752): "Such are, in short, the Virtues of this Age; that, to use the Words of Cicero, Si vellem [sic] omnia percurrere Dies deficeret —I shall therefore omit the rest . . . ." 10 Cf. the French translation issued in 1746-50, entitled Le Spectateur: ou, le Socrate moderne . 11 From the first number Mr. Spectator claims to have distinguished himself by keeping a "most profound Silence," a trait which earns him the reputation of "a dumb Man" (No. 4, 5 March 1711). In the present passage Fielding especially recalls No. 550 (1 December 1712), where Mr. Spectator remarks: "As a Monosyllable is my Delight, I have made very few Excursions in the Conversations which I have related beyond a Yes or a No." In founding a new club, however, he intends to be more talkative in the future: "But that I may proceed the more regularly in this Affair, I design upon the first Meeting of the said Club to have my Mouth opened in Form, intending to regulate my self in this Particular by a certain Ritual which I have by me, that contains all the Ceremonies which are practised at the opening the Mouth of a Cardinal." (D. F. Bond, ed. [1965], IV, 470-471.) 12 In An Argument against the Abolishing of Christianity in England (1708), Swift assures his readers that he wishes to preserve only "nominal," not "real" Christianity, the latter "having been for some time wholly laid aside by general Consent, as utterly inconsistent with our present Schemes of Wealth and Power" (H. Davis, ed. Bickerstaff Papers and Pamphlets on the Church [1957], p. 28). 13 In Act III of The Historical Register Fielding ridiculed Walpole in the character of Quidam, who, though not exactly silent, is more remarkable for his actions than his words: after winning over some disaffected Patriots with a bribe, he produces a fiddle and leads them all in a dance. 14 Sum] After this word Molloy inserted the phrase "of Money". 15 This famous legend about the philosopher Roger Bacon (1214?-94) was dramatized by Robert Greene in Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1594). Friar Bacon, it is said, made a head of brass and with the Devil's help gave it speech. The allusion here is doubly apt, Walpole being known to the Opposition as "Bob Brass." 16 Cf. the obscure political allegory in Common Sense (24 September 1737), referring to one "Gaspar Cornaro," a Venetian empiric: "Your Wits have abundance of By-names for him; as . . . Haberdasher of Small Wit , &amp;c." 17 Presumably a pun: a "Drum" was a large party usually held in the evening for the purpose of playing at cards. Fielding often ridicules this fashionable diversion: e.g. True Patriot (28 January 1746), Tom Jones (XVII,vi), Amelia (IX,vii). 18 great] Molloy struck out "great" and substituted "profound a". 19 maintaind . . . lived.] Molloy obliterated Fielding's phrasing beyond recovery and substituted these words. This change may have caused the apparent error in the plural form "Coffee-Houses" earlier in the sentence. 20 h[ea]r] The MS is perforated here; both published versions read "hear." 21 The OED surmises that "mumbudget" was originally a children's game in which silence was required. Examples include The Merry Wives of Windsor (1598), V.ii.7; Butler's Hudibras (1663), I.iii.208; and John Taylor, the Water Poet (1630): "The magazin of taciturnitie, the mumbudget of silence. . . ." "Budget" signifying a pouch or wallet, the phrase "to open one's budget" in colloquial usage means "to speak one's mind."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Casting Off Copy and the Composition of Hooker's Book V by W. Speed Hill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Fift Booke" of Richard Hooker's treatise, Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie , is a folio in sixes, collating A 8 B-Z 6 2A 4 . Printed by John Windet on commission from Edwin Sandys for its author, it was published in late 1597. 1 Since 1888, when the Church and Paget revision of John Keble's edition of 1836—itself frequently reprinted—was published, it has been known that Bodleian MS Add. C.165 served as printer's copy for the 1597 edition. 2 The printer's markings in the margin and within the text of this manuscript were described by Percy Simpson in his work on proofreading of early printed books. 3 The scribe, Benjamin Pullen, a clerk in the employ of John Churchman, Hooker's father-in-law, was identified by C. J. Sisson in 1938. 4 But the Pullen manuscript has never been systematically compared with the folio Windet produced from it. In particular, the volume's composition, imposition, and presswork have never been described in detail, perhaps because of the complexity of the process itself, perhaps because only recently has it been recognized that many Elizabethan books, especially folios, were set by formes, not seriatim, and that copy necessarily had to be cast off to make this possible. 5 With the Pullen manuscript before us, however, it is possible for the first time to view the process of casting off copy from over the compositor's own shoulder, rather than—as a bibliographer after the fact—inferring what happened from the evidence of the printed book alone. As Simpson commented, 'Tis noble manuscript, with its literary value, its accuracy and completeness of text, and the range and variety of evidence which it yields to the bibliographer, must be unrivalled' (2.23). Casting off copy is simple enough to describe in the abstract: it is the estimating of how much manuscript copy a given printed page requires so that intervening pages can be 'cast off'—that is, marked but not set in type—to enable the compositor to set copy for a quired folio from the inside of a quire out, thereby conserving type and matching composition to presswork. In practice, however, the process can be dauntingly complex to reconstruct, as evidenced by Charlton Hinman's work on the First Folio. The Pullen manuscript consists of 225 folios; four of the original leaves are missing, and two of these have been replaced; of these, the first (f. 140) seems to have been used for setting type, the second (f. 228) not. 6 Pullen, a professional scribe, wrote in an eminently legible secretary hand for Hooker's text and an equally clear italic for marginal notes and for quotations within the text. No compositor could have wished for clearer copy, and in many respects, Windet's folio is simply a reprint of that manuscript. However, Hooker himself worked over Pullen's transcript with great care, adding marginal notes, interlining additions to or deleting material from the text, correcting both the spelling and pointing of his scribe's transcription, and underlining words, phrases, or whole passages as an instruction to the printer to set these in italics. 7 Where Hooker's intervention was substantial, casting off was obviously more difficult. The text contains a number of marginal notes, and while Pullen allows for the lengthier ones by cut-outs into the text, others added marginally by Hooker made accurate estimates of the amount of type required more difficult. For purposes of exposition, I will first outline separately the various stages of the process, the evidence for each that the manuscript provides, and the logic by which that evidence has been interpreted. 8 I will then analyze Opposite: Folio 60 r , Bodleian MS. Add. C.165 (reduced). The cancelled page break at line 14 ('expresseth, | declaring'), 78/H6, is a casting-off break, marking the point from which setting H3 v ('H6') began after H3 r had been cast off. The actual break, corresponding to H3 r |3 v in 1597 ('was | they'), 'H6', marks the point the compositor reached when the page lengths within sheet 3 of quire H had been adjusted. The second series of numbers, '38 . . . &lt;42&gt;&lt;8&gt;4', tallies the number of lines the compositor had set on his way back to H3 v . These begin again at line 16, below 'God,', where '9' is visible, '13 . . . 17 . . . 21 . . . 25', are not. Reproduced by permission of the Bodleian Library. sample gatherings to show how, in the event, these processes interact in actual composition. Finally, I will draw what inferences seem appropriate for bibliographers (or editors) who would study the order of composition of a text known or suspected to have been set from cast-off copy. The principal manuscript evidence that copy was cast off is a series of marks in its right-hand margins. 9 These are in the form of a dash, drawn between the lines, with the number 20 or 40 following, counting the number of lines of manuscript copy cast off. Not all folios are so marked, for not every page was cast off. In the analysis that follows, I begin by assuming that if a page was marked for casting off, it was in fact cast off in actual composition unless unambiguous evidence demonstrates the contrary. There is a division of copy between the compositors in the manuscript between ff. 1-136 (= $B-Q1) and ff. 137-227 (= Q2-$2A). 10 I will be discussing only the work of the first compositor (Compositor A), whose marks in ff. 1-136 are more revealing of the process itself. The following table indicates both the frequency and distribution of casting-off marks within the folios of the MS set in $B-P in 1597: Because the normal sequence of printing for a folio in sixes was from the inside of the quire out, and because printing could not begin until the conjugate pages of the inner forme of sheet 3 (3 v .4 r ) were in type and imposed, the compositor typically cast off the earlier pages in the forme (1 r -3 r ) twice as frequently as the remaining pages (3 v -6 v ): 61 out of 83 pages cast off, or 73%. But in the thirteen gatherings Compositor A set ($B is a special case), every page of the twelve was cast off at least once. The pages in the Pullen manuscript corresponding to quire B, it will be noticed, do not bear the characteristic markings. As the initial gathering to be set (quire A was reserved for the preliminaries, whose manuscript does not survive), the compositor—or more likely, the master, John Windet—was obliged to work out in setting it a correspondence between his copy and the text as set to measure for use throughout the volume. Moxon gives three methods for calculating the ratio between copy and type: a) line against line (that is, how many lines of copy are needed per single printed line); b) measuring with a pair of compasses the number of whole lines of copy necessary to set a given number of whole lines of print; and c) adding the number of characters in the copy and dividing by the known number of characters on Casting-off Marks for Signatures B-P in Bodleian MS Add.

In setting the 24 lines of type appearing on B1 r in the 1597 folio, and ignoring the 10 set to short measure opposite the initial factotum, the compositor would have reckoned that 18 lines of manuscript supplied him 14 whole lines of type. To complete a 47-line page, the standard with which he began the volume, he would need 47 x 18/14 = 60.6 lines of copy. Having calculated a working ratio between his copy and his type, he verified it by setting a full page (B1 v ) in which 60 lines of manuscript copy were set in 47 lines of type. He could now count ahead with some confidence by units of 60 whole lines, ignoring part lines, in order to estimate how much copy would be needed per printed page. The divisions marked at 20 and 40 lines within a given page-unit of copy supplied convenient subdivisions of the basic page unit of 60 manuscript lines, made line-counting easier, and told him where he was in the midst of composing that page. Although the corresponding folios in Pullen are not so marked, there is evidence that pages 3-7 of quire B were also cast off. If we count ahead in the manuscript from the end of B1 v , B4 v is marked to begin exactly 300 manuscript lines ahead. In addition, the break between B4 r and 4 v is marked at '|worke' (f. 5 v ), flush with the left-hand margin. The mark is the usual one: an extended bracket that looks like an elongated 'L' with the vertical stroke crossed, |thus . This break, labelled 'B8' in the left-hand margin, is marked three lines above in the manuscript at 'of | true' (cf. 1597, B4 r .-3; that is, 3 lines from the bottom of the page). The copy bracketed by the two breaks as marked in the manuscript is equivalent to exactly two printed lines in the 1597 text. Although the setting of quire B was to a degree anomalous and to analyze its composition here is to anticipate certain points in the argument presented later, it seems best to clarify the problems its composition presents before proceeding. After the compositor had calculated the ratio of manuscript copy to type in setting B1 r , verified it in 1 v , and cast off 2 r -4 r (without marking individual pages within this block), he began 4 v at a break marked flush with the left-hand margin of f. 5 v ('|worke', line 11), the beginning of the line. Once B4 v was in type, its forme-mate 3 r was set, beginning at a punctuation break, mid-line: 'religion; | that' (f. 3 v .9). B3 r ends mid-word, 'possibi|litie' (f. 4 r .29), evidence that 3 r was set to this point in the manuscript, not from it. It is also noticeably loose in its type-setting at the bottom of the page, as the compositor sensed that he needed to stretch his copy to fill out the 47 lines allotted to his page. The outer forme of sheet 3 was now ready for the press. The inner forme (3 v .4 r ) was then set, in that order: the page break at 3 v |4 r is not noted marginally but is bracketed in the text. Turning to sheet 2, the compositor began B5 r at '| be exemplified', the beginning of a line in the manuscript (f. 6 v .11) and continued through 5 v : both pages break in the middle of a line. To supply forme-mates, B2 r and 2 v were set, in that order, for the break at 2 r |2 v is in the middle of a word ('a|dorned', f. 2 r .10; cf. 1597, B2 r .1). In imposition, one line of type was taken from B2 r and given to 2 v . That actual page break in 1597 falls at 'Romans | had' (B2 r .-1), marked in pencil; there is a second mark, in ink, at line 29, 'conjecture | before' (cf. 1597, B2 v .1), exactly one line of type beyond the actual break in 1597. The ink mark represents the point to which the compositor set B2 r , using 48 lines of type; the pencil mark, where the break fell when the 47-line standard was applied. Finally, B6 r and 6 v were set, in that order, to supply forme-mates for 1 v and 1 r , which had been left standing. The evidence is in the manuscript markings: both pages begin in the middle of a line; that is, from where the previous page had ended, not from a point to which the compositor had counted when he cast off copy. If we put the subsequences together into a single skein (I find no evidence of two compositors at work throughout the quire, although a second workman certainly assisted in the imposition and probably set 1 r and 1 v ), we have: 1 r →1 v →(4 v →3 r →3 v →4 r ) →(5 r →5 v →2 r →2 v )→6 r →6 v . If we examine the pages as printed, we find by optical inspection that the outer forme in the inner two sheets was machined first, 12 confirming the compositorial sequence above. Three headlines were set for the verso (X, Y, Z) and two (x, y) for the recto; these pair up as follows: conjugate pages forme headlines 1. 3 r .4 v outer 3 y.Y (missing ' of ') 2. 4 r .3 v inner 3 x.X 3. 2 r .5 v outer 2 y.Y (has ' of ') 4. 5 r .2 v inner 2 x.X 5. 6 r .1 v inner 1 x.Z 6. 1 r .6 v outer 1 --.Y In interpreting page breaks as marked within the manuscript text, we have to distinguish between those made when copy was being cast off initially and those made subsequently, in the course of actual composition or, later, of imposition. If all went well, these would coincide; but if there were miscalculations, or if the copy was especially irregular, a single page (or line) might have as many as two cancelled breaks in addition to the actual break. 13 Two axioms, therefore, are useful in distinguishing between the two: (1) If the break falls within a line of the manuscript, and not at a punctuation break, it marks the point to which actual composition had come and stopped. Similarly, if the break is marked within a word , the same logic holds: no compositor is going to estimate to an arbitrary point within a line, much less within a word, of his copy. Conversely, breaks marked at the beginning of a line in the left-hand margin, or at punctuation breaks within a line, are normally casting-off marks and indicate the point from which composition of a given page would have begun, after it had been cast off. (2) If a page break is marked twice within the manuscript and if one of these is cancelled and the other corresponds to the break as it appears in the printed text, the first will usually (but not invariably) be the casting-off mark made prior to setting type, the second, the one made in the course of actual composition to fit copy in when the page ahead is already in type, or later at imposition, as page lengths are juggled to achieve pages of uniform length on facing pages. Of the two, the first is more reliable. Applying it, together with the 20/40 marks in the margin, makes it possible to identify which pages were cast off and to compute how many lines of copy were cast off for each page. To return to quire B, the ratio of 60 lines of copy to 47 lines of type holds up quite well. B1 v -6 v (that is, the full size pages) are each set to a 47-line standard, and 661.5 lines of manuscript copy, or an average of 60.14 lines of copy per printed page, were set in type. After the first two pages of quire C, the page-unit drops to 46 lines and remains there—except for variations caused by misestimating copy being cast off—for the rest of the volume. Such variations, however, may require as many as 48 lines per page (e.g., on D3 r , D3 v , and D5 r , within one gathering) or as few as 45 (N3 v , N4 r ), or even 44 (O1 v ). The corresponding number of lines of copy, which average 60 for pages 3-7 in quire B (2 r -4 r ) and quire C (3 x 60, 1 x 59), begins to drop to 59 in quire D (1 x 62, 1 x 60, 3 x 59, 1 x 58, 2 x 57, 1 x 53), and to 57-58 in quire F (1 x 56, 3 x 57, 1 x 58) and subsequent gatherings. Naturally, when the copy demanded it, there were variations in the number of pages the compositor elected to cast off, as well as the number of lines of copy he allotted each page. In quire H, for example, which has a number of marginal notes cut into the text (its composition is analyzed below), the counts run as follows: H1 r :62 lines, 1 v :58, 2 r :58, 2 v (not cast off), 3 r :57, 3 v :55, 4 r :57, 4 v :56. The next gathering, however, was quite regular: I1 r -3 r were cast off in page-units of 58, 59, 58, 58, and 59 lines. As the compositor became accustomed to Pullen's copy, he was able to vary, ad hoc, the two halves of his basic ratio: the number of lines of printed text per page (46 ± 2) and the number of lines of manuscript copy cast off (59 ± 3). 14 Similarly, the number of pages cast off within the 13 gatherings for which we have unambiguous markings varies from 4 to 9 (median, 6). Within a given sheet, the inner forme was composed first in 32 out of 42 sheets, 15 and in the 14 quires (including B), the normal sequence, 3→2→1, from the inside out, was followed in 10 cases; in two, the order was 2→3→1, and in two it was 3→1→2. The table below summarizes the presswork in quires B-P, based on an analysis of the MS markings and checked by optical inspection of the printed sheets. order through press 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th $B outer 3 inner 3 outer 2 inner 2 inner 1 outer 1 $C inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $D outer 2 inner 2 inner 3 outer 3 inner 1 outer 1 $E inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $F inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $G inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $H inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $I inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $K inner 3 outer 3 outer 2 inner 2 inner 1 outer 1 $L outer 3 inner 3 inner 1 outer 1 outer 2 inner 2 $M inner 3 outer 3 inner 2 outer 2 inner 1 outer 1 $N inner 2 outer 2 outer 3 inner 3 inner 1 outer 1 $O outer 3 inner 3 inner 2 outer 2 outer 1 inner 1 $P inner 3 outer 3 outer 1 inner 1 outer 2 inner 2 From the point of view of the compositor setting from cast-off copy, the reason why the inner forme would normally be composed first is that the maximum number of pages remains (1 r -3 r ) in which to apportion the intervening cast-off copy. Were he to begin with the outer forme of sheet 3 (that is, with 3 r ), only four pages would remain (1 r -2 v ), and if the copy was irregular or if a miscalculation took place, the margin of error was one page less. The same logic holds, obviously, were he to set sheet 2 before sheet 3, for once 2 is in type, only two pages are available for cast-off copy in sheet 1 (1 r , 1 v ). To take a comparatively simple example, the copy for quire E contains no marginal notes cut into the text by Pullen or added by Hooker. The compositor cast off the first five pages (59 lines X 4 + 58 X 1 = 294 MS lines). He began setting E3 v at '| no ordinarie meane', at the left-hand margin of folio 32 r .13 (that is, line 13). The '—20' and '—40' are not visible on the preceding folio because the right-hand margin is so tightly bound that the 20 and 40 are in the gutter; the dashes, however, are visible. The break at 'no ordinarie meane' is not marked: the compositor simply counted to this point and began setting copy. He could not have begun setting at E4 r , for the page break at 3 v |4 r falls in the middle of the word 'nourish|ment' (f. 32 v .33), so that in this instance 3 v must have been set before 4 r . Thus, the inner forme of sheet 3 was set in normal order: 3 v →4 r . To set the outer forme, he needed only start E4 v where 4 r left off—at the '|ment' of 'nourish|ment'—and to set 3 r he returned to the cast-off break on f. 31 r .30, which is marked in the left-hand margin and at a punctuation break: '| And because'. In the printed volume, the telltale signs of cast-off copy are variations in the spacing of the type on the page, especially towards the bottom, as the compositor squeezes in a given amount of copy into the space previously allotted, or, alternatively, stretches it out to get back to a page already in type. In the 1597 folio, the bottom of E3 r is noticeably loose in its type-setting. The entire sheet, then, was set in the sequence 3 v →4 r →4 v →3 r (or 3 r →4 v , for there is no way to determine priority between E4 v and 3 r , nor is it significant: once we know that 4 v was set after 4 r , we know that inner 3 was set before outer 3). A slightly more complicated example illustrates the flexibility of the basic process. In quire L, 1 r , 2 r , and 2 v were cast off in units of 58 manuscript lines (1 v , which had a Hooker insertion, was cast off for 50 lines), and setting began with 3 r , marked in the manuscript at f. 88 v .18. A glance at the opening at ff. 88 v -89 r of the manuscript shows why (cf. 1597, sig. L3 r ): there are nine marginal notes cut into Hooker's text, and the compositor did not want to estimate the type/manuscript ratio here. Having set L3 r , he cast off 3 v (58 lines) and 4 r (59) in order to complete outer 3 with 3 r 's forme-mate, 4 v , which he began at a punctuation mark (f. 91 r .15). He then went back to set inner 3 (3 v .4 r ) in the normal order, beginning L3 v where 3 r had left off, in the middle of a line (f. 89 v .1). If we look to the printed book for evidence of casting off, we find only that at the bottom of L4 r , where one would expect trouble, the compositor has squeezed in a note by cutting in below the catchword—a very awkward solution (cf. a similar example at K5 r ). Otherwise L3 r -4 v have 46 lines each, and the type-setting is even and regular throughout. However, the sequence within the sheet was the reverse of normal (3 r →4 v →3 v →4 r ), and outer 3 was printed first. Glancing back now over the pages remaining to be set, he saw that L1 v contained a lengthy insertion by Hooker at the end of chapter 52 (f. 86 v ). Only 50 lines of copy had been cast off in order to leave room for it, but Pullen's and Hooker's hands differed so much that such a guess was likely to be inexact. Starting therefore at the cast-off break marked at L1 r |1 v , a line-end (the initial word of the line is itself divided at the end of the line before, 'to-| gether', f. 86 r .26), he set 1 v . Casting off L5 r and 5 v from the end of 4 v , he set 6 r next, the forme-mate of 1 v , completing inner 1, which was printed first. He then set L6 v and 1 r to complete the sheet. Returning now to sheet 2, he set L2 r from the end of 1 v , but he required 47 lines to reach the casting-off mark at L2 r |2 v . The 60 lines of copy allotted L2 v could be set in 46 lines of type so long as an extensive note was set entirely in the margin and did not encroach upon the body of the text. In imposition, the extra line in L2 r was assigned 2 v , for the break in 1597 (' nature | do') falls one set line earlier than the break for 2 r |2 v marked in the manuscript, '|cannot naturallie ' (f. 87 v , —10, —8; cf. 1597, L2 v .2). To supply forme-mates for L2 r and 2 v , he returned to 5 r and 5 v , which he had cast off. These he set seriatim, for L5 r ends mid-line. However, the pattern of headlines suggests that outer 2 was printed first. The order of the formes through the press was: formes O.3 | I.3 ∥ I.1 | O.1 ∥ O.2 | I.2 ------------------------------ headlines z.X | x.Y ∥ z.X | y.Y ∥ x.X | z.Y In quires, D, H, and N, sheet 2 was composed before sheet 3. The reason, as in quire L, was the complexity of the underlying copy. In D, the compositor encountered the first extensive marginal notes cut into the text block in the manuscript. He cast off the first five pages (299 lines), stopping at the left-hand margin (f. 22 v .25). But instead of beginning with sheet 3, he elected to begin with sheet 2 and started with D2 r , casting off the intervening copy to find its conjugate, 5 v . He then set D2 v where 2 r had ended, for the break between the two occurs in the middle of a line, at 'beholding | them' (f. 21 r .19), and no 'D4' appears in the left-hand margin. Because D5 v was in type, 5 r needed two extra lines, resulting in a 48-line page, in order to avoid turning over a marginal note onto 5 v . The entire sheet, then, was set in the sequence 2 r →5 v →2 v →5 r . Turning now to sheet 3, he could begin either with D3 r —that is, where 2 v ended—or with 3 v , at the casting-off mark on f. 22 v . Although one would expect him to begin with D3 r , the manuscript markings favor 3 v . If we remember that when the actual break in the printed text either coincides with the indicated break in the manuscript, or is one or more full lines of type discrepant, setting began at this point, we can see why. The compositor began at a casting-off mark, '| which in both' (f. 22 v .25), the beginning of a line, and set 46 lines of type, through 'which | the matter' (f. 23 v .13; cf. 1597, D3 v , last line), four words beyond the casting-off mark. D4 r and 4 v were set seriatim: 4 r fell short eight words of its cast-off page break (see illustration 2, FLE , vol. 2, of f. 24 r , 8 lines from bottom), but 4 v reached the beginning of 5 r —already in type—with some stretching. But returning to set D3 r , 4 v 's formemate, he needed 50 lines of type to set the 60 lines of cast-off MS copy. Extensive cut-outs into the printed text page were necessary to prevent the carry-over of marginal notes into the margin opposite the next chapter, for the chapter heading had to be placed in the margin too, opposite the beginning of the chapter (cf. sig. D3 r , 1597). 16 In imposition, the page-break at 3 r |3 v was moved back two set lines to 'un|to' (f. 22 v .22; cf. 1597, D3 r , last line), creating a non-standard 48-line page, and the two extra lines of type were added to D3 v , originally set as a 46-line page. Thus, to accommodate the vagaries of his copy, the compositor needed 48 lines for D3 r and 3 v and 47 lines for 4 r and 4 v . 17 Faced with irregular copy or a major miscalculation, the compositor had but two choices: he could expand (or crowd) the type on a single page to get back to copy already in type and imposed, or he could, in imposition, shift lines from one page to another. Expedients such as variant spellings or contractions, or tinkering with the wording of the text itself, were used but sparingly. It was apparently a matter of the workman's pride—or the master's rule—that orthographic variation or textual emendation was to be used only as a last resort. In a prose text, there is no flexibility in converting prose to verse, or vice-versa, or of creating or avoiding turnovers of individual lines of verse. As Hooker's chapter breaks were infrequent, the compositor had perforce to set large blocks of unbroken text. To return to quire D, it will be remembered that I started by assuming that 'if a page was marked for casting off, it was, in fact, cast off'; that is, that the compositor did not set it at once, seriatim, but skipped it to begin setting within the quire at a later page. But the operative unit is not the quire, but the sheet, and there is no way to determine by simple inspection whether sheet 2 in quire D was wrought off before or after sheet 3. Outer 2 was printed before inner 2 and inner 3 before outer 3, but both formes printed first have the same pair of headlines, as do both formes printed second. But in D, 9 out of 12 pages are marked in the manuscript for casting off. Had composition started with sheet 3, the compositor would not have had to resort to 47-line pages for D4 r and 4 v or 48-line pages for 3 r and 3 v ; rather, setting from the inside out, only 5 pages would have been cast off, 3 v -4 v would have been set to the normal page-unit of 46 lines, and there would have been no need for pages of non-standard length. In this instance, then, the evidence of non-standard page lengths within the quire confirms the evidence of the manuscript markings. In sheet 1, D6 r and 6 v posed no problems: they were set seriatim from the end of 5 v to the 46-line standard. D1 r and 1 v , set from cast-off copy, did. Setting D1 v first, to go with 6 r , the compositor apparently started at the casting-off mark, 'right, | when' (f. 19 v .14; cf. 1597, D1 r , last line) and set to the break marked in the manuscript for 1 v |2 r , 'in. | For there' (f. 20 r .35; cf. 1597, D1 v , last line). A cancelled break eight words earlier, at 'deprived | of', suggests a miscalculation in the actual composition of D1 v . When he returned to set D1 r , however, he ran into more substantial trouble. He originally set the 60 lines of cast-off copy in 47 lines of type, through 'preeminence' (f. 19 v .15; cf. 1597, D1 v .1), but this left only 45 lines for D1 v . In imposition, one line was given D1 v , evening the pages at 46 lines each. In setting D1 r , a turnover of a word and a half (' hono- | rable worke .') at the end of chapter 15 wasted most of a line, and he had to squeeze his remaining copy into the six lines at the bottom of 1 r . Line 14 of the manuscript, 'injuried and | defrauded of theire right, ⌿ when ⌿ places not sancti-', has two cancelled breaks in addition to the actual one, evidence of the difficulty the compositor had in apportioning his copy between the bottom of D1 r and the top of 1 v . In quire N, the second in which sheet 2 was composed before sheet 3, the compositor elected to postpone composition of a series of insertions in the manuscript in Hooker's hand on f. 111 r , which fell in N4 v . 18 Casting off N1 r and 1 v (58 lines each), he began with 2 r , at a punctuation break in his copy (f. 106 v . 17), 'propagation, | or', and set 2 r and 2 v , in that order. Although N2 r is marked for casting off, setting did not begin with 2 v , for it begins mid-line ('Christ | belongeth'; f. 107 v .5); at the top of f. 107 r , a '—20' has been can-celled. He then cast off N3 r through 4 r (3 X 58 lines) and 4 v (44 lines), stopping at a punctuation mark just beyond the Hooker insertions. He then set N5 r , the forme-mate of 2 v , beginning ' q Tertullian' (cf. 1597, N4 v .—9). He continued by setting N5 v through f. 113 r .4, marking the page break at 'of | theire'. The sequence 2 r →2 v →5 r →5 v would have readied inner 2 for the press, had not substantial complications arisen in the composition of the intervening copy that had been cast off for sheet 3. N3 r —4 r having already been cast off, sheet 3 was begun from the end of 2 v at 'only | for theire' (f. 108 r .26) in order to set the Hooker insertions first. Starting N4 v at '| gather' (f. 110 v .22), a line-end, he reached the break marked for 5 r ('voyde. | q Tertullian') in only 39 lines of type, 7 short of the 46 needed. The inner forme of sheet 3 was likewise troublesome. As set, N3 v overshot its cast-off break by 5.5 lines (the indicated break is at 'obedience | to', f. 109 v .—3; the actual break, not marked, is at 'gratious | and', f. 110 r .5; cf. 1597, N3 v .—6, —1). Had he set N4 r to the standard 46-line page, it would have overshot its cast-off page break by 4.2 lines, encroaching further upon the already short 39-line N4 v . (The indicated break between N4 r and 4 v is at '|gather,' f. 110 v .22; the actual break falls mid-line at 'theire | evidence', line 24, and is marked in ink.) Such major discrepancies could only be resolved in imposition, and the presence of ink markings in the manuscript suggests a second hand. The page size for inner 3 (3 v .4 r ) was reduced to 45 lines. The two lines thus released narrowed the gap in N4 v from —11 (7 from the original setting, 4 from the spillover of 4 r ) to —9. These 9 lines, lifted from N5 r , are found at the bottom of 4 v in the 1597 volume: they are marked in the manuscript at f. 111 r .29 ('voyde. | q Tertullian') and f. 111 v .5 ('faultes | wherewith'). A corresponding block, unmarked in the manuscript, was taken from N5 v to make good 5 r . Despite these adjustments within the gathering, the only variation in the order of the formes through the press was that outer 3 preceded inner 3 and sheet 2 preceded sheet 3 through the press. By all odds the most complicated signature was H. It is anomalous because sheet 3 seems to have preceded sheet 2 through the press although sheet 2 was certainly composed before sheet 3. Its difficulties are instructive as to the limits to which a compositor was willing to go to compose by formes. He first cast off three pages (62, 58, and 58 lines) and began to set H2 v . He was thus able to accommodate two large cut-outs into the text for marginal notes on f. 59 r (cf. H2 v , 1597) on a single page and to begin chapter 41 at the top of H5 r . H2 v was begun at 'mindes, | doth' (f. 58 v .22), a punctuation break. Although the manuscript is not marked, I suspect that H2 v was originally set through 'magnifie; or when', the last line of f. 59 r ; only the actual break, at line 33, 'petiti|ons,', is marked. The composition of sheet 2 proceeded as follows: 2 v →5 r →5 v →2 r . H3 r —4 v were necessarily cast off (see Table 1). But in casting off copy within sheet 3, the compositor realized he was short of copy and moved the page break at H2 v |3 r back 6 set lines, releasing these for 3 r . H3 r was cast off, and the 20/40 marks are counted from 'petiti|ons,'. Still, the page breaks within sheet 3 fell at 58, 55, 57, and 48 lines after H2 v |3 r . But with sheet 2 already in type, he had no choice but to follow the normal sequence. He began setting H3 v , then 4 r (completing inner 3), 4 v (noticeably loose in its type-setting) back to 5 r , and finally 3 r , loosest of all, to complete outer 3. But as set from the cast-off break marked at f. 61 v .20 ('| for the minister'), H4 v was only 41 lines long, five short of the 46 needed (cf. 1597, H4 v .6). Five lines, marked in the manuscript at f. 61 v .14, 21, were subtracted from H4 r to make good 4 v and lesser amounts adjusted backwards in 3 v and 3 r . As originally set, the page-units were: 3 v : 46.9 lines of type 4 r : 46.8 " " " 4 v : 40.2 " " " As adjusted, these became: 4 v : 40.2 + 5.0 = 45.2 (equivalent to 46 because at the end of a chapter) 4 r : 46.8 (est.) - 5.0 + 4.2 = 46.0 3 v : 46.9 (est.) - 4.2 + 3.3 = 46.0 3 r : 46 - 3.3 = (expanded to 46) For the purpose of making such adjustments, I estimate that the compositor had, by manipulating how tightly or loosely he set his type, an average of 6 sorts' margin per 83-sort (average) line. In a 46-line page, therefore, the maximum number of sorts available to him was 46 x 6 = 276 ÷ 83 = 3.325, which is exactly what he was obliged to make good by the conspicuously loose type-setting of H3 r evident in the 1597 folio. The compositor was now obliged to return to sheet 2, for what H2 v lost at its end, it had to make up at its beginning. Thus five set lines were taken from H2 r (from 'remaine, | must', line 16, to 'mindes, | doth', line 22, f. 58 v ) to make 2 v good, and a similar series of adjustments backwards from these five lines was effected. When the page break between H1 v and 2 r was moved back 4.5 lines of type (to 'scripture | besides', f. 57 v .—5, from '|and so pleasinge', f. 58 v .2), it solved another problem as well, for in attempting to set 1 v with 2 r in type, there was no way he could set the first three lines of chapter 38—that is, between the beginning of the chapter at the bottom of f. 57 v (2 lines of copy) and the casting-off mark at the top of f. 58 r (1 line of copy), from which 2 r , already in type, had begun—in complete lines of type. Recall that the original proportion was 14 lines of type for 18 lines of copy, and 14/18 X 3 = 2.33. So the cast-off break at H1 v |2 r , '|and so pleasinge', was cancelled. Within sheet 1, H1 r , set from the end of G6 v , undershot its casting-off mark on f. 57 r .15 by 3.5 lines of type, probably because a marginal cut-out into the text on f. 56 v , with its 10 short lines, threw off the compositor's estimates. Had the initial three pages of quire H been set as they were cast off, the page lengths would have been: 2 r : 47.5 lines of type 1 v : 47 " " " 1 r : 49.5 " " " As revised, these became: 2 r : 47.5 - 5.0 + 4.2 = 46.7 lines of type 1 v : 47.0 - 4.2 + 3.5 = 46.3 " " " 1 r : 49.5 - 3.5 = 46.0 " " " These were manageable discrepancies within the 46-line page norm. Just as the unit of printing is the forme, not the page, so the unit of composition of cast-off copy is the sheet, not the forme, and insofar as possible all adjustments of page lengths to compensate for errors in casting off copy were made within the sheet. In quire H, unless considerably more than six pages of type were standing at one time, sheet 3 must have been machined before sheet 2, although sheet 2 was composed before sheet 3. The evidence for the latter is the fact that the casting off marks for H3 r are counted from the break at 'petiti|ons,', in the middle of a word: 3 r , therefore, must have been set after 2 v . The evidence for the former is inferential, as it allows for the shifting of blocks of type in imposition between adjacent sheets. In imposition, then, sheet 3 was readied first (by the subtraction of 6 lines from H2 v ) and the necessary adjustments backwards from 2 v held sheet 2 up. The resulting order of the formes through the press, then,was absolutely regular. formes I.3 | O.3 ∥ I.2 | O.2 ∥ I.1 | O.1 ------------------------------- headlines y.Y | x.X ∥ y.Y | x.X ∥ y.Y | x.X The difficulties generated by setting cast-off copy were thus resolved in advance of the actual printing. Two additional series of marks appear in the margins of the Pullen manuscript. In order for the compositor to keep track of where he was in a gathering, and to set the pagination accurately, he marked each page in the form 'C4' (= C2 v ; see illustration 4, FLE , vol. 2) or, more frequently, in the form frac78-H6 (that is, page 78, or sig. H3 v ; see illustration). Not infrequently, these have had to be cancelled and the text marked again at the page break in the final printed form, whose pagination is noted in the margin. A second series of marks appears in quire H for the first time (see illustration 7, FLE , vol. 2, of f. 107 r ). These tally the lines of copy as they are set , in the ratio of 5 lines of copy to 4 lines of type, as an aid to estimating exactly how much copy has been set and how much was left before reaching a cast-off break. They may start with any number, arbitrarily, but they rise by 4's and appear every fifth line in the copy. For example, in the right-hand margin of f. 59 v , beginning at line 20 with '—22', they continue with '—26' (l. 25), '—30' (l. 30), '—34' (l. 35), and on to the top of f. 60 r where '—38' is visible, '—42' and '8' have been cancelled, and '4' (that is, 44), corresponding to 44 lines of H3 r , remains. Were the original series to have continued, '—46' would have fallen at line 13, corresponding to the page break marked in line 14, 'expresseth, | declaringe'. But this break has been cancelled and moved back to line 10, 'was | they' (cf. H3 r |3 v , 1597, and see illustration of f. 60 r ). Two conclusions come from this analysis. First, the nature of the underlying copy and of the difficulty the compositor had in setting it are by no means necessarily reflected in the bibliographical data of the printed volume. More particularly, without the manuscript, an analytical bibliographer could not reconstruct the exact order of the formes and sheets in most quires from the standard evidence of the order of running-titles and tests for printing on recto or verso of a sheet, and he could not even suspect the sort of adjustments that took place to even out pages. 19 This inference may seem a modest return on the very considerable effort required to reconstruct the composition of $B—P in Windet's 1597 folio, but its caution is nothwithstanding useful to analytical bibliographers and editors alike. For example, the sheets of quires G and F were each printed in the same sequence—from the inside out and inner forme first—but they were composed in different sequences: The evidence that G1 v was set before G2 r (although sheet 3 presumably was machined before sheet 2) is that G2 r begins in the middle of a line—that is, at a break made by the end of G1 v , not from a cast-off break. I cannot account for the variation. In quire H, sheet 2 was composed before sheet 3, as we have seen, but this would not be evident from headline analysis: the inner and outer formes in each sheet have identical pairs of headlines, and none of the difficulties in composition are reflected in the printing of the volume. Similarly, the composition of quire N was complicated by Hooker's interlinear and marginal additions on f. 111 r , but the only bibliographic evidence that major adjustments had to be made is that sheet 2 preceded sheet 3 through the press. The evidence here is that, given the priority of inner 2, outer 3, and inner 1, which we can establish by inspection of the printed sheets, the following sequence of headlines is the only possible one, if we assume that no single headline can appear in consecutive formes within the same quire in standard two- or three-skeleton printing: formes I.2 | O.2 ∥ O.3 | I.3 ∥ I.1 | O.1 ---------------------------- headlines x.X | y.Y ∥ z.X | x.Y ∥ y.X | z.Y Lacking the manuscript, the underlying textual causes for the variant order would be simply irrecoverable. Secondly, setting by formes from cast-off copy had little effect on the integrity of the text. In six instances the compositors have added words not found in the copy and unlikely to have been added by Hooker in proof; 20 of these, four are attributable to setting from cast-off copy: reference 21 MS reading 1597 reading 1597 reference 19.24 Infidels and Infidels 3.21 (B2 r ) 157.22 same selfesame 78.26 (H3 v ) 259.1 think the think that the 133.-1 (N1 r ; in errata) 469.9 Church Church of God 269.-4 (2A3 r ) The criteria for selecting these additions as attributable to the compositor are that they were added toward the bottom of a page in which he was trying to get back to a page already in type (259.1, 496.9), or in pages where the extra word was an obvious aid, whether added consciously or not, in filling out a page allotted to cast-off copy (19.24, 157.22). In twenty-six instances the compositors dropped words or omitted marginal notes found in the manuscript, but of these only five are attributable to cast-off copy, and two of these fall in the same line: reference MS reading 1597 reading 1597 reference 89.19 dailie omitted 40.-9 (E2 v ) 198.18 yeat, that " 100.-4 (K2 v ) 368.11 likewise " 195.29 (S2 r ) 433.9 O God " 232.-1 (X2 v ) Finally, one word was omitted from the text (' sheepe ', at V6 r ) but retained as the catchword at the bottom of V5 v . If we consider that the text of Book V runs to some 182,000 words, nine changes, none crucial to the meaning of the passages altered, are trivial indeed. Given the complexity of the underlying copy, with its cut-outs for marginal notes, infrequent chapter breaks within long stretches of prose, interlinear insertions and additions difficult to estimate, the fidelity to copy of Windet's two compositors is extraordinary. Granted, Hooker did read proof—he caught one of the compositors' additions in the errata—and Windet, Hooker's 'cousin,' (Sisson, p. 53) could be expected to take a more than commercial interest in the volume. The 1597 folio of Book V, then, may well be an exception to the general run of Elizabethan books. As compared to the 1593 folio of Books I—IV, which Windet also printed, the composition of 1597 was certainly more leisurely. 22 There is only one compositor at work at a time, and there was no way—nor any need—for him to keep up with the press, assuming that both were simultaneously at work on this volume alone, of which there is no evidence. 23 Why, then, did he go to the trouble of casting off copy if not to allow simultaneous setting by two or more compositors, as in 1593? The answer seems to be simply to avoid too much standing type. Even at its most complicated, setting cast-off copy in $B—P of 1597 did not require that more than the usual six pages of type be standing at any one time: one forme on the press or being distributed, one sheet being composed and imposed. The only possible exception is quire H, but here the printing of sheets 2 and 3 in the reverse order of their composition may well have been to prevent having more than six pages in type at once.</field>

Hinman gives the best exposition of printing by formes in The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), 1:47-51, 69-89. 6 For an analysis of the foliation of the MS, see FLE , 2:xvi-xvii and n. 3. The evidence that substitute folio 140 was used for setting type is a second series of numbers (1-84) used to enumerate a division of copy between two compositors; f. 140 is numbered 4 in this subsequence. Folio 228 is unnumbered. 7 For Hooker's corrections, see FLE , 2:xvii and nn. 4-6, Appendix I.i, and textual notes, passim . 8 In attempting to follow the exposition, the interested reader will be aided if he has open before him a copy of the 1597 edition or a facsimile (Scolar or Da Capo), but short of securing a photographic facsimile of the entire Bodleian MS, he will have to take the bulk of my references to it and its hieroglyphics on faith. Volume 2 of the Church and Paget revision of Keble's edition (1888) has a collotype of f. 111 r (facing p. v), Simpson reproduces f. 226 v (1935, facing p. 78), the illustrations in vol. 2 of the FLE supply generous samples of the printer's marks, and a reproduction of f. 60 r accompanies this article. Even so, many of the marks on which the following analysis is based are invisible except by reflected light, for the compositor's pencil has left only a dint, creasing the fibers of the paper, and others are covered by tape or lost in the gutter. However, the relation of MS to print can be approximated by following the two series of references—to the foliation of the MS and to the signatures of the printed text—in the FLE . I am particularly grateful to Georges Edelen, who has read several versions of this paper against a photocopy of the Bodleian MS, for many constructive suggestions throughout its preparation. My analysis should be compared with his of Windet's 1593 folio of the Preface and Books I-IV, 'The Composition, Printing, and Proofing of the 1593 Folio', Appendix III, vol. 1, FLE . 9 See frontispiece, FLE , vol. 2, and caption; in frontispiece of vol. 2 of Works (1888), a '—20' is clearly visible after line 5 in the right-hand margin. 10 The second compositor sets in a different line measure (125 vs. 128 mm), uses a different case (foul case—italic for roman, roman for italic, especially in caps—is virtually systematic), and has a level of textual error five times that of his colleague. For a census of the printing errors in 1597, see Appendix II.ii, vol. 2, FLE . I have found no evidence that a second compositor was at work in quires B-P, with the possible exception of quire B; however, a second workman did aid in imposition, as the MS is occasionally marked in ink, not the pencil characteristic of A. * There is reason to believe $B was cast off, but because the characteristic markings are not present in the margins, it has not been counted. See text, below. Bracketed figures are not visible in the manuscript. 11 See Mechanick Exercises , ed. H. Carter and H. Davis, 2nd ed. (1962), pp. 239-244. 12 See Kenneth Povey, 'The Optical Identification of First Formes', Studies in Bibliography , 13 (1960):189. 13 In the illustration of f. 60 r accompanying this article, l. 10 shows the actual break, l. 14 the cancelled break, between H3 r and H3 v . See also illustration 4, vol. 2, FLE , of f. 12 r : a cast-off break is marked at the beginning of line 1; the actual break fell in the middle of line 2. For other examples, see illustrations 2, 5, and 8; see also n. 21, p. xxv, FLE . 14 I have no iron-clad explanation of why the line standard drops from the 47 lines of quire B and the first two pages of C to 46 lines for the remainder of Compositor A's stint, but I offer the following suggestion: if the master had set the initial ratio as 47 lines of type to 60 lines of copy, Compositor A may simply have elected to drop the ratio to 46:59 in order to secure greater flexibility. If the absolute upper limit was 48 lines, 46 obviously gave him the leeway of two extra lines into which to fit cast-off copy. 15 On the priority of formes, see Kenneth Povey, 'Working to Rule, 1600-1800: A Study of Pressmen's Practice', The Library , 5th ser., 20 (1965):13-54. 16 Illustration 5, FLE , vol. 2, of f. 22 r shows the compositor's problem. The original cast-off break is marked in line 1 at a punctuation mark, 'catechismes. | With religion'. Immediately to the right, in the margin, is his signature mark, 'D5', for D3 r . Having set 2 v before 3 r , he marked his copy at 'this | daie' where actual composition stopped and cancelled the first mark. The two notes, h and k , falling as they do at the end of the chapter, occasioned the non-standard, 50-line page, for they had to be got in before the end of the chapter. 17 A lengthy addition to a quotation from Thomas Cartwright at the foot of f 24 v in Hooker's hand was not set at all, nor was provision made for it in casting off D4 v : evidently Hooker continued to work over the MS even while the 1597 folio was in press, and the printer was unable to insert this addition in proof; see illustration 3, ibid. 18 Church and Paget reproduce the folio; see frontispiece, Works (1888), vol. 2. A '—20' is visible in the right-hand margin below the 'given?' of line 5; the marked break is visible in line 29 (ignoring Hooker's insertions) at 'voyde. | q Tertullian'. 19 For example, it is generally assumed that one can infer the order of composition from the order of the formes through the press. But the case of signature H, analyzed above, suggests that this inference, while probable, is by no means certain. Knowing that the inner forme is printed first, one can assume that it was composed first as well and that copy was cast off to make this possible. But the contrary is not true: If the outer forme is printed first, it does not indicate that copy was not cast off. 20 For an analysis of Hooker's proofing of the 1597 folio, see FLE , 2: xxviii—xl. 21 Reference is to page and line numbers of the FLE text. 22 See FLE , 1:xviii—xx. 23 Cf.

Lawrence found it necessary to introduce an article on "Sir William Killigrew's The Siege of Urbin " with the remark that "the works of the three brothers Killigrew are apt to be confused" and that "no clear idea exists concerning Killigrew bibliography". 1 Since then, such reference works as Falconer Madan's Oxford Books . Volume III 2 and Donald Wing's Short-Title Catalogue 1641-1700 , II, 296-297 ( STC ), have contributed a great deal to a better knowledge of Killigrew bibliography. But neither W. J. Lawrence in 1928 nor Donald Wing, more recently, seem to have taken any notice of what remains the most complete source of bio-bibliographical information on the eldest Killigrew brother, Sir William (1606-1695), namely Boase and Courtney's Bibliotheca Cornubiensis . 3 This is unfortunate for, apart from historical and literary references to Killigrew, both in printed and manuscript sources, the Bibliotheca provides a list of this author's printed works which is a useful complement to that given in the STC . For instance, what was presumably Killigrew's first literary product, a poem entitled Ad Regem &amp; Principem se mutuo amplexantes , has been ignored in Wing's list. Signed "Guilielmus Killigrew, Equitis aurat. fil. nat. max. Ioannensis", this poem appeared in Carolus Redux (Oxford, 1623), a collection of Latin verse written by Oxford professors and students on the occasion of Prince Charles' return from Spain, after his wooing of the Infanta. But even on the combined authority of Boase and Courtney, on the one hand, and Wing, on the other, it remains a hazardous undertaking to try to establish the canon of Killigrew's works, as a close analysis of various items attributed to him in both lists will reveal. I therefore propose to examine to what extent the hitherto accepted "canon" stands in need of completion and/or correction. I have taken the STC , rather than the Bibliotheca Cornubiensis as the basis for this investigation, Wing's work being more widely available and easier to refer to than its obscure predecessor. References after each of Killigrew's works will be to the entry-number in the STC (from K453 to K472 or, if necessary, to some other number), but the abbreviation BC will be added whenever the work concerned is also (or only) listed by Boase and Courtney. The absence of either reference, then, means that the work in question is here for the first time assigned to Killigrew. Of the six anonymous items listed as Killigrew's in the STC (and generally accepted as his), i.e. K459, K460, K463, K464, K468, and K471, three can be shown to be by the dramatist indeed, mainly on the basis of internal evidence, and therefore need not detain us very long. The authorship of The Imperial Tragedy (1669; K460—BC), a play sometimes ascribed to Killigrew in eighteenth-century biographical dictionaries, 4 has only recently been established: Sir William's signature on the title-page of that tragedy, included in a copy of his Four New Playes (1666; K458-BC) now preserved in the collection of the Rosenbach Foundation at Philadelphia, unmistakably argues his authorship. 5 Nor can there be any question about his authorship of Midnight Thoughts (1681; K463), a collection of pious meditations later on reissued in an expanded form and entitled The Artless Midnight Thoughts of a Gentleman at Court (1684; K455-BC): though a bibliographical puzzle, this "Second Edition with Additions" has a dedication to King James II, signed "William Killigrew". And the anonymous 1664 issue of the comedy Pandora (K464) does not pose any problem: the play also appeared in Three Playes (1664/5; K470-BC), the title-page of which leaves no doubt as to the identity of its author. 6 Sir William is also credited with a number of pamphlets on economic and financial matters, the authorship of which, as opposed to that of his dramatic and "devotional" works, is nothing short of problematic. Nevertheless, it can be shown, not only that some of these pamphlets have been erroneously ascribed to him, but also that some other items which we may confidently assume to be his (or partly his), have never received the place they deserve in the canon of his works. A good example of the former mistake is Boase and Courtney's indiscriminate attribution to Killigrew of three pamphlets, two of which are not by him and the third of which is only partly his. Of Certaine Papers concerning the Earle of Lindsey his Fennes (London, 1649), an eight-page long pamphlet, the first two or three pages are not by Killigrew: they contain a request of the "Committee for the Fens" to "agree the Differences" between drainers and commoners, as well as a paper sent by one William Howett to Killigrew, informing him of the commoners' viewpoint. And even a superficial glance at the self-explanatory titles of the other two pamphlets, A Reply to Sir William Killigrews dispersed Papers, by the Owners and Commoners in Lincolnshire (n. p., 1651?) and Reasons proposed against the passing of the Bill for setling of 24,000 acres of Land . . . upon George Bampfield Esq., in Trust for Sir William Killigrew, Sir Henry Heron, etc. (n. p., 1660?), will suffice to exclude them, once and for all, from the Killigrew canon. Similarly, two items listed by Wing as Sir William's are obviously not by him. The first, which begins A Breviate of the Cause depending and proofes made before the Committee of the late Parliament for the Fens (K456-BC), is tentatively dated 1651 under Killigrew's name but 1655 elsewhere in the STC (B4412). This is another of the innumerable pamphlets in the fen controversy in which Killigrew for nearly half a century actively participated, both as a drainer investing huge amounts of money in the project and as a prolific pamphleteer. A Breviate of the Cause , however, was not drafted by Killigrew but by the "Inhabitants between Borne and Kime Eae, in the County of Lincolne", and was meant to expose the "evil design" of the Earl of Lindsey, Sir William, and other "undertakers". Moreover, its date, instead of 1651, may indeed be 1655, occurring as it does towards the end of a volume of chronologically arranged documents in the Thomason Tracts, the last of which is dated June 1655. Wing's caution with respect to the authorship and the dating of the second item, beginning A Short Answer to a Paper, Intituled, Reasons (K468-S3560) is unwarranted: the author was the dramatist's son, of the same name, who not only signed the pamphlet, styling himself the "Sole Executor of Sir William Killigrew, deceased" but also accurately dated it "May 6, 1698". 7 The younger William 8 appears to have inherited his father's interests in the fens, for a decade after the latter's death he was still trying to obtain an enactment of the drainers' rights in the "Lindsey Level", a draining project in Lincolnshire started around 1629. This is evident from the historical account of the works of draining which he published as The Property of all English-Men Asserted, in the History of Lindsey Levell . . . In behalf of Himself, and the rest of the Dreiners and Participants of Lindsey Levell in Lincolnshire (London, 1705). In view of his petitions addressed to Parliament (in 1701, for instance), 9 and his continuing preoccupation with the drainages, it can cause little wonder that, as early as May 1698, with A Short Answer to a Paper , he drew the Commons' attention to "a Bill brought in by Sir Robert Killigrew [his brother], and Others, Undertakers and Participants for the pretended Draining of Lindsey-Level, in Lincolnshire". Apart from some introductory matters, A Short Answer is largely a word for word repetition of two almost identical pamphlets of much earlier date, both undoubtedly by Sir William. The first of these, dated 5 September 1654, begins The Earle of Lindsey his Title, by which himselfe, and his Participants (K457); the second, with a somewhat more extensive caption title, beginning The late Earle of Lindsey . . . (BC), is co-signed by Sir Henry Heron (another relentless "claimer") and dated 1 July 1661. Wing (II, 179) lists the latter pamphlet as Heron's only, without so much as a reference to Sir William's share in the authorship. Nor does he mention two other pamphlets for which both men or, at least, Heron and a William Killigrew were responsible: To shew the Countreys Consent for the drayning of Lindesey Levell (London, 16 March 1670/71; British Library) and The Dreining of Lindsey Level justified against the Aspersions of their Adversaries (London, April 1678; Public Record Office, London, State Papers 29-403). To establish the identity of the "William Killigrew" who collaborated on either pamphlet is a difficult task. Nevertheless, if internal evidence can be relied on at all to provide a clue in this respect, it would seem that the ascription to Sir William of the former pamphlet, provided in a list of Wing addenda, 10 is correct. Heron and Killigrew, indeed, conclude To shew the Countreys consent in a very confident note: "And thus we conceive that we have shewed a general unanimous consent of all the Commissioners, and also of all the Countrey, in those days, when those who now oppose were very young " (my italics). Only undertakers who had been involved in the business of draining for over forty years—as Sir William and Sir Henry Heron had been in 1671—would be expected to speak of their adversaries in those terms. On the other hand, the very phraseology of some passages in The Dreining of Lindsey Level justified may suggest that the younger William was its co-author. Reminding their readers of the riots which occurred in the fens in the early 1640s, the authors observe that "Sir William Killigrew's great House was pulled down", thus striking a matter-of-fact note which is markedly different from that in Sir William's account of the same events in, for instance, His Answer to the Fenne-Mens Objections (London, 1649; K453—BC): ". . . we have also proved, that our houses were pulled downe, our Corne burned, our Draynes spoiled, our Tenants thrown out, and our possession taken from us by violence, while we made no resistance. For while my house was pulled downe, the Sheriff and a Justice of peace looked on . . ." (my italics). Unless the double authorship accounts for the impersonal tone in The Dreining of Lindsey Level , I am inclined to believe that the younger William Killigrew was responsible for part of this pamphlet, published in 1678. On the other hand, it is fairly safe to credit his father with the authorship of a third (anonymous) pamphlet, not listed in either the STC or the Bibliotheca : A Short State of the Case for the Earle of Lindsey's Fenns . Not only do its argumentation and very phraseology closely echo earlier and succeeding pamphlets but the copy of it preserved in the British Library (Add. MSS 21,427, f° 139v-14or) is autographed and dated "29 March 1652" by Sir William. Three other items—pamphlets on banking experiments—present problems of dating and authorship which cannot be as easily resolved. The uncertainty in this respect is reflected in the STC (as well as in various library catalogues): An humble proposal showing how . . . (K459) is listed as anonymous and dated 1663; A proposal, shewing how this nation may be vast gainers . . . (K466-BC) is listed as Killigrew's and tentatively dated 1663; 11 and To the King and Queen . . . An humble proposal (K471) is also given as anonymous, but tentatively assigned to 1690. Why the first item should be listed as a separate work is not clear, for it is identical to the third, the full caption titles of both being To the King and Queens Most Excellent Majesties; the Lords Spiritual and Temporal; and to the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses assembled in Parliament. An humble Proposal shewing how this Nation may be vast Gainers by all Sums of Mony given to the Crown, with-out lessening the Prerogative . Wing's dating 1663, though not his listing it as anonymous, corresponds with that of the copy in the Cambridge University Library, for instance, which has the hand-written addition "by Will. Killigrew 1663". On the other hand, a copy of it, preserved in the Kress Library, of the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, has been marked "Sir William Killigrew c. 1690" (the date assigned by Wing to K471). The second pamphlet, with a very similar caption title, A Proposal, Shewing How this Nation may be vast Gainers . . . Humbly Offer'd to the King's Most Excellent Majesty; the Lords Spiritual . . .—and with the author's name printed on the first page—has the hand-written date "1696" in the Kress Library copy as well as in one of the three copies in the British Library (the other two being undated). This pamphlet is a reissue of To the King and Queens . . . An humble Proposal , brought out at the request of one Sir James Shaen [Sheene] whose letter inviting Killigrew to reprint his Proposal , together with the latter's reply, introduce the pamphlet (pp. 1-4). 12 It is clear, then, that it would be wrong to ascribe to Killigrew three different pamphlets , seeing that two are identical—but have been differently dated in different libraries—and that a third one is only a reissue (with some materials added) of the first. This being established, it will be interesting to try to determine not only the approximate dates of publication of both documents but also what these dates reveal about the authorship. That neither could possibly have been published in 1663 is certain: the author states that he "put this Design in Writing, at the Request of several considerable Members of both Houses of Parliament, in the Reign of King Charles II when a War was voted against France; but a Peace being concluded, no Money was given. . . ." 13 The wording here suggests that his Humble Proposal —and obviously also its reissue—were published after 1685, the end of Charles' reign. Moreover, whereas the Humble Proposal is dedicated to both "the King and Queens Most Excellent Majesties", the Proposal, Shewing How is "humbly Offer'd to the King's Most Excellent Majesty" only. This implies that the Humble Proposal was either dedicated to James II and Mary of Modena—and therefore published between 1685 and 1688—or to William III and Mary II—and therefore published between 1689 and 1694. As the reference to "the Reign of King Charles II" seems to suggest a publication date not immediately following upon 1685, a date between 1689 and 1694 may be the likelier guess. At any rate, the Proposal, Shewing How should be dated after 28 December 1694, the date of Queen Mary's decease. The best indication, however, as to the actual publication date of this pamphlet is Killigrew's bracketed addition to Sir James Shaen's above-mentioned letter, "writ by himself Three Weeks before his Death": as Shaen, Irish Farmer of the Revenue and Commissioner of the Excise, died on 13 December 1695, 14 the Proposal, Shewing How should be assigned to the final days of 1695, at the earliest, or, what is more likely, to 1696. In view of this combined internal evidence, the "later" (Harvard) dating of both the Humble Proposal and its reissue, the Proposal, Shewing How , namely "c. 1690" and "1696", respectively, is very acceptable, and presumably correct. 15 The latter date also confirms beyond any doubt that the dramatist Sir William could not possibly have been the author of either pamphlet, for he died in October 1695, 16 two months earlier than Shaen. His son William, therefore, who was also responsible for the fen pamphlets discussed above, is the only one to qualify for the authorship of the banking schemes contained in the various proposals usually assigned to the elder Killigrew. When all of the foregoing evidence is considered, it becomes clear that the list of Sir William Killigrew's printed works, as it appears in Wing's STC , stands in urgent need of thorough revision. Four items must be added to it, for two of which Sir William seems to have been partly responsible. Five other items must be removed from it, three of which are by the younger Killigrew who, in view of this, deserves a place in the STC 1641-1700 , being the author of at least four different pamphlets in all. For clearness' sake, both canons will be listed here. They are chronologically arranged and, in the case of Sir William, also include those works which are not mentioned in the present article but the authorship of which is no matter for dispute. The reference to the entry-numbers in the STC and to Boase and Courtney has been preserved, wherever possible.

I am also indebted to the other libraries mentioned below, both in England and the U.S.A., for their kind assistance. 8 I have been unable to determine either his birth-date or the date of his decease. Sir William's eldest son, Sir Robert, presumably born in 1630, was still alive in 1695, as is evident from the father's will (Public Record Office, P.C.C. Irby 152). William, a former page to Charles II [see C.S.P. Dom. Charles II, 1660-61 (1860), 301], and afterwards a Captain in the Army, was possibly born in 1631 or 1632. 9 Historical Manuscripts Commission.

Keith Horsefield, British Monetary Experiments 1650-1710 (1960), pp. 156ff., 197, has referred to Killigrew's Humble Proposal as one of the earliest schemes of the kind, mistakenly dating it 1663. Although not first published until about 1690, the proposals were indeed of an earlier date, as is implied by Killigrew's addition, "put in Writing . . . in the Reign of King Charles II when a War was voted against France; but a Peace being concluded, no Money was given . . .". The allusion here may be to February-March, 1678, when the Commons demanded a declaration of war against France, and July 31 of that year, when a peace was finally concluded [see Commons Journals. Vol. IX: 10 Oct. 1667-28 April 1687 , pp. 454, 455, 460; and David Ogg, England in the Reign of Charles II (1963, 2 vols), II, 543 ff.] The fact that the younger Killigrew should have written on economic matters as early as 1678 lends plausibility to his authorship of the pamphlet co-signed by Henry Heron in the same year (see above). Of his banking design drafted in 1678, an English manuscript copy may have existed: see Hist. MSS Comm., XIIth Rep., App. IX (1891), p. 132. A French version of it, together with proposals for the erection of a Bank of Credit in France, is contained in Rawl. MS D419, at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. This manuscript is in Killigrew's own hand, as appears from a comparison of it with the letter he wrote to the Earl of Dorset in August 1692 [see my note "The Earl of Dorset and William Killigrew", N &amp; Q , N.S., 24 (March-April 1977), 131-133]. This French version is more extensive than the English one, numbering 51 densely filled folios in all. Apart from the text of the scheme which was to appear in the Humble Proposal , it also included such matters as "la première mémoire doné aux surintendent par Wm Killigrew concernant l'establissement dune Bancque de Creditt" (f° 1-4r), and a lengthy refutation of any possible objections against the erection of this kind of bank (f° 27r-51r). Whether Killigrew scored any success with his proposals in France and managed to have them put into execution, I have not investigated. At any rate, after having been endorsed by the "Maire, Eschevins et Communautez" of London, on 20 August 1682 (f° 16r), these proposals were also submitted to the French government, being "envoyée a Monsr. l'intendent des finances le 6 de May 1684 samedy au soire" (f° 14r). 16 J.

      <field name="heading_text">THE TEXT OF Paradise Lost : A Stemma for the Early Editions by R. G. Moyles</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the early eighteenth century, when the English nation was beginning to go 'Milton mad', editions of Paradise Lost rolled off the presses with amazing regularity: between 1678, which saw the first non-authorial text, and 1749, when Thomas Newton produced his definitive text cum notis variorum , more than twenty-five editions of the poem were presented to the English reading public. They ranged all the way from sumptuous (and expensive) subscription Folios to popular pocket-sized duodecimos and they included such extras as 'sculptures', explanatory notes, eulogistic verses, a "Life of Milton" and Addison's celebrated Critique . By the time the latest (Newton's) became available, the first three had become collectors' items and the fifteenth (Bentley's) had been the subject of one of the most vociferous debates in the history of Milton scholarship. Many of those 'extras' (the illustrations and the commentaries), the development of a scholarly and popular interest in Milton's poetry and Bentley's contumacious emendations have been examined by scholars. 1 One important area, however, has been entirely neglected: the treatment of the text itself. When did editors of Paradise Lost begin to seek a definitive text? When did they become aware of the state of the original editions—of the variants between them? When did they begin to use what W. W. Greg calls "reasoned editorial judgment"? This paper represents an attempt to remedy that neglect and to answer those questions by examining two aspects of the text: editorial treatment of the Quarto and Octavo variants; and the perpetuation of progressive error. According to the evidence presented by Helen Darbishire in the textual apparatus to her 1952 edition of The Poetical Works (Vol. I, pp. 282-308), there are, in addition to the few alterations demanded by the re-divisioning of the poem into twelve books, approximately eight hundred variations between the Quarto (1667) and Octavo (1674) texts of Paradise Lost . 2 By far the greatest number of these consist of minor spelling and punctuation changes, the conversion of initial letters from upper to lower case (and vice versa ), and the alteration of the ampersand to and . There are, however, approximately thirty-five which can be called 'substantive'—variants which, in Greg's words, "affect the author's meaning or essence of his expression"; 3 when these are examined one finds that they fall into three distinct categories: I.

In every instance my decision to place a reading in either one or the other category is supported by modern editorial preference, from Henry John Todd (1801) to Alastair Fowler (1976). An examination of those major editors also reveals that in fifteen instances there is a difference of opinion regarding the choice of variant: one or the other is not obviously superior and, in critical editions at least, editorial judgement must be used. In a few cases it may seem perverse to insist that there is any choice at all; at 4.451, for example ("Under a shade of [ on ] flours"), the Octavo reading seems to be manifestly inferior. Yet the fact of the matter is that B. A. Wright (1956) and Alastair Fowler (1976) both adopt the Octavo reading. I have therefore placed it in the third category of indifferent variants and I have done the same with every reading for which there exists a division of opinion among modern editors. The chief implication of those lists, of course, is that editing Paradise Lost demands a great deal of critical acumen. An editor must not only make a choice of copy-text from two of comparable authority, but must understand the extent and nature of the variants between them, and be prepared to engage in reasoned eclecticism. As far as this present study is concerned, those categories of variants will establish the relationship of any subsequent edition to the originals and help determine the quality of editorial treatment it received. However, since eighteenth-century editors seldom used the originals as copy-texts, relying instead on the more accessible later editions, one other feature, that of 'progressive error', must also be examined. Not only must Text A be collated with Text B in terms of substantive variants, but all fresh readings, newly introduced either as compositorial errors or intentional emendations, must be discovered. When Text C is then collated with B these new readings are examined to see if they have been eliminated or perpetuated; and again the fresh errors of C must be recorded. This painstaking collation is extremely rewarding: it reveals editorial attitudes, indicates choices of copy-text, shows the slow and erratic development of a concern for authorial intention and, through the establishment of a stemma, charts the course towards a definitive text of Paradise Lost . In the contract between John Milton and Samuel Simmons (dated April 27, 1667), by which the latter obtained the right to publish Paradise Lost , Simmons gave notice that he intended to produce three editions of the poem. The first two, well-known as the Quarto and Octavo texts, were published under Milton's supervision, the second being considerably "Augmented and Revised"; the third was published in 1678, four years after Milton's death, thus becoming the first non-authorial text. As such it is undistinguished and textually insignificant, for Simmons, even though he must have known that there were errors in the Octavo, made no attempt to restore any authoritative readings: the 1678 is a virtual reprint of the 1674, duplicating both its style and format (8°: A 4 B-Y 8 ), and preserving its faults. 4 When the ownership of the rights to publish Paradise Lost changed hands in the 1680's, passing from those of the obscure Simmons to those of the 'prince of publishers', Jacob Tonson, it may have seemed, to a casual observer, that a dramatic change had taken place. 5 It was not Tonson's fashion to simply follow his predecessor—to merely make the poem available. When he decided to publish a fourth edition in 1688 he determined that it would be as distinctively Tonson's as it was Milton's. The large folio in fours, with its quality paper, its clear 14-point type and wide margins, was unquestionably more impressive and handsome than Simmons' octavo. Its twelve 'sculptures', created by John Baptist Medina, were the first ever to adorn a Milton text. And below the frontispiece portrait of the author was Dryden's now-famous eulogy, written especially at Tonson's request: Three poets, in three distant ages born, Greece, Italy, and England did adorn. The first in loftiness of thought surpass'd; The next in majesty; in both the last. The force of nature could no farther goe: To make a third she joynd the former two. Tonson had, as he intended, honoured Milton, raised the quality of the book, and gained for the poem new recognition. 6 It may also have seemed that Tonson took equal care with the text as well, perhaps even to the extent of hiring someone to supervise the preparation and correction of the printer's copy. Not only is the spelling consistently modernized ( hee-he , pitie-pity , fatall-fatal , etc.), but seemingly-conscious and judicious emendations (beyond the expertise of a compositor) have been made at 2.568 ( obdured becomes obdurate ), 11.586 ( fast-first ) and 1.756 ( Capital-Capitol ). The last, in fact, is quite perspicacious and has been adopted (often without acknowledgement) almost universally ever since. And finally, the casual observer might have even concluded that, in one signature at least, the supervisor is correcting his copy against a Quarto text, by virtue of the fact that her is corrected to thir (2.483), counsel to council (2.506) and this to his (2.527). In spite of that evidence, however, close examination would have revealed that the text was not as carefully prepared as it had seemed at first glance. It was, to begin with, not based on the 1674 original but on the 1678 reprint whose few fresh errors at 2.855 ( might-wight ), 4.148 ( of-a ), 5.455 ( his-this ), 9.431 ( band-hand ), 9.574 ( that-and ) and 9.1064 ( as omitted) are unintentionally preserved. There is no evidence at all to show that the Octavo text was ever consulted. Moreover, though three superior Quarto readings were restored— her-thir (2.483), counsel-council (2.506) and this-his (2.527)—it is doubtful that they were recovered from the Quarto text itself, for at every other instance where the Quarto variant is obviously superior the incorrect Octavo reading (perpetuated through the 1678) is followed. It would be too far-fetched to suggest that the supervisor had access to only Signature F (the variants occur on F1 verso and F2 recto) or that he collated only two pages. It seems more likely, especially in view of his emendatory skill, that those readings were emended intuitively; the supervisor recognized them as errors, corrected them, without knowing that he was restoring authoritative readings. In the 1688 edition, then, Jacob Tonson produced a text which exhibits several characteristics typical of the editorial treatment it would receive for many years to come. First, it was based not on an original text but on an immediately-preceding one which, though corrected by someone other than the compositor or proof-corrector (as yet unknown and as yet undeserving of the title 'editor'), was corrected intuitively, not against an authoritative text. Thus a manifest contradiction is its hallmark: a few judicious improvements have been made and some authoritative readings accidentally restored; yet a larger number of Quarto readings remain undiscovered, the errors of the 1674 and 1678 texts are perpetuated, and fresh readings (both compositorial error and intentional emendation) have been introduced, removing the text farther from the authoritative originals than before. In 1691, when Tonson, capitalizing on the unqualified success of his first venture, published another sumptuous folio in fours (identical in size and format to the previous), the same editorial ambivalence marred the text, this time manifesting itself most noticeably in the different handling of the accidentals and the substantives. 7 Great care was taken to regularize the spelling, reducing such words as conquerour and general to conq'rour and gen'ral when the lines (in his view) demanded it, proving that someone paid close attention even to scansion; and in his treatment of the punctuation he was excessively fond of commas: 1.218 goodness, grace and mercy shew'n (1667-88) goodness, grace, and mercy, shew'n (1691). The extent and nature of the alterations argues for a very close scrutiny of the text indeed, even though they were intuitively made and not in an attempt to restore an authoritative text. As far as the substantive text is concerned, however, the 1691 edition is the worst-printed thus far. Not only does the supervisor fail to restore any original correct readings or rid the text of the many 1688 corruptions (from which the 1691 was printed), but he allows the introduction of a number of fresh errors. Many of them are merely typographical ( goonness for goodness , sin for sing ), but some affect the substantive text: here for hear (3.185), inclin'd for incline (3.402), and omitted (4.749), He for Him (5.298) and first omitted (7.500) are examples. They are all clearly errors and not conscious emendations, indicating that the unknown supervisor's responsibility was restricted to refining the accidentals, leaving the substantive text to the mercy of the compositor. The sixth edition of Paradise Lost which appeared in 1695, again by Tonson and again a handsome folio, marks a slight turning of the editorial tide: for the first time there is evidence to show that two texts are being used—the 1688 as printer's copy and the 1674 to correct it. More obvious than that, and better known, is the fact that the 1695 edition is accompanied by (though not always bound with) the first set of annotations ever compiled for the poem, Patrick Hume's three hundred and twenty-one pages of "Explanatory Notes." 8 The key question arising from the contiguity of those facts is: was Patrick Hume the editor of the 1695 edition and thus the first known editor of Paradise Lost ? It has already been established by Ants Oras that Hume's set of "Notes" is not a textual apparatus. 9 It consists primarily of straightforward, often simplistic, explication and "explanation of obsolete words," and contains only four textual notes: at 3.48 and 7.451 he offers two conjectural emendations, blot for blanck and soul for foul ; at 9.1092 he corrects from to for (already corrected in 1691); and at 10.989 he emends these faulty lines: Childless thou art, Childless remaine: So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two (1667-1691) Childless thou art, Childless remaine: So Death Shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two (1695 "Notes"). This of itself is enough to show that Hume was more than casually acquainted with his text. It is provable, in fact, that in compiling his notes he eschewed all later editions, taking his quotations directly from the 1674 text and thereby eliminating all later corruptions. The 1695 text, however, follows the 1688 edition and it is this discrepancy, between Hume's "Notes" and the 1695 text which they accompany, which suggests that Hume did not edit the sixth edition. At 1.404, for example, Hume's note correctly spells Hinnom as it was in the Octavo text whereas the 1695 text follows the incorrect 1688 Hinnon . Similarly, at 2.506 and 2.568, where the 1695 perpetuates the corrupt readings, Council and obdurate , Hume follows the correct 1674 versions, Counsel and obdured . Most significant, at 1.756 Hume retains the 1674 Capital , defining it as "Satan's chief place of residence"; the 1695 text adopts Capitol . Surely if Hume were responsible for preparing the printer's copy, having compiled his own notes from a 1674 edition, he would have caught such obvious errors and have corrected them. It seems quite probable that he would have dispensed with the 1688 text altogether and have used the 1674 as copy. In either event, it is reasonable to assume that under his supervision the spelling of the 1695 would have been closer to the 1674 as well—closer, that is, to the spelling which he preserves in his annotations. It seems most likely, then, that Tonson purchased the right to publish Hume's commentary but engaged someone else as editor—someone who, perhaps influenced by Hume or his "Notes", sought to improve the text by correcting the 1688 copy against a 1674. But again, though his effort is laudable, his editorial performance is marked by inconsistency and contradiction. He is, for example, astute enough to adopt Hume's emendation at 10.989, but not enough to take advantage of the equally judicious one at 7.451 (now also universally accepted). He manages, by reference to the Octavo text, to rid the 1695 of several errors transmitted through the 1678 and 1688 editions and recovers authoritative readings at 4.148 ( of for a ), 9.431 ( band for hand ), 9.574 ( and for that ), 9.601 ( this for his ) and 9.1064 (the omitted as ). More impressively, he read his text diligently enough to notice that the lines at 10.550 and 11.427 were metrically deficient. If he had been far-sighted enough to also have used a 1667 text he would have recovered the authoritative readings; not being that advanced in his editorial procedure, he was forced to intuitively emend the lines, removing them even farther from their originals: Thir penance, lad'n with fair Fruit, like that (1667) Thir penance, lad'n with Fruit, like that (1674-1691) Thir penance, lad'n with Fruit, like to that (1695) Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive (1667) Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that derive (1674-1691) Nor sinn'd thy sin, but yet from that derive (1695) In the final analysis, the 1695 edition suffers from the same editorial inconsistency as its two previous companions. One can see, however, that progress is being made, erratic but nevertheless valuable: three (now universally-accepted) emendations have been introduced, one of the original texts has been used (the 1674), and editorial expertise is improving. Of course, even without such progress the three Tonson Folios would still remain memorable contributions to literary history—beautiful tributes to Milton and secure rungs in 'Jacob's immortal ladder'. When Tonson resumed publication of Paradise Lost ten years later he was convinced that, through the success of his three Folios, the poem had become popular enough to warrant a "smaller edition." In 1705 and 1707, therefore, he produced two 'royal' octavos and in 1711 a small, pocket-sized duodecimo—editions which were responsible for bringing Milton to the attention of the so-called 'ordinary' English reader. And now it seems as if the text itself has become the important feature; in the preparation of the 1705 two editions are again used, the 1695 as copy and the 1674 as correcting-text, and to good advantage: cleansed of nearly every previous corruption the seventh is the purest edition thus far. The 1707, being a slavish reprint, reinforces the impression that at last a reverence for textual fidelity is beginning to control editorial treatment. All that remains, one feels, is for some editor to become aware of the 1667 text and restore its authoritative readings; definitiveness will follow fast. The 1711 edition, however, even though it relies on the 1705 as copy-text, shatters that illusion by being the first to introduce wholesale emendation. The new (unknown) editor throws caution to the wind and on more than twenty-five occasions alters his substantive text: that becomes their (3.678), broider'd becomes border'd (4.702), pleasing becomes pleasant (5.42), hid becomes laid (9.408), oft-stooping becomes half-stooping (9.427), to becomes through (9.641), both becomes but (9.1128) and the following line undergoes this change: Thir penance, lad'n with fair Fruit, like that (1667) Thir penance, lad'n with Fruit, like that (1674-1691) Thir penance, lad'n with Fruit, like to that (1695-1707) Thir patience , lad'n with fruit, like to that (1711). As a result the 1711 edition is the least satisfactory thus far, vastly inferior to the 1705. That other editors were not yet concerned with authoritativeness is evidenced by the fact that the 1711 edition was, according to Henry Todd, "much esteemed" and was used, in preference to the 1705, for many years to come as copy-text; 10 such errors as half-stooping and patience were not finally removed from the text until 1749. Nevertheless, in the meantime, in spite of that backward step, some advancements continued to be made. In 1719 Tonson engaged John Hughes, who had earlier overseen the 1715 edition of Spenser, to edit the tenth edition of Paradise Lost . In a letter to Tonson, dated August 17, 1719 (BM Add Ms. 28875), Hughes states that he has no desire to have his name "mention'd or any notice taken to the public." The reference is to a former letter in which he had complained of the lack of recognition his editorial work on Paradise Lost had received: to the edition of Spenser his name had been attached but as editor of Paradise Lost he had remained anonymous. Tonson, it seems, must have set the matter straight, perhaps explaining that editorial services limited to the correction of copy (as opposed to writing a commentary) were paid for but not publicly acknowledged, for Hughes professes complete satisfaction. The letter also seems to indicate that Hughes fully expected to have been asked to work on the deluxe edition of The Poetical Works , planned for publication in 1720. He seems disturbed to learn that Thomas Tickell will be its editor and suggests, rather facetiously, that Tickell should "abundantly oblige [him] in giving a correct edition" of Milton, for whom he had "a more than ordinary zeal." Hughes would, he states, lend Tonson his copy of the first edition of Paradise Lost to get proofs read by, but not to tear to pieces "for his press-copy." Thus, we not only learn that the tenth edition of 1719 is the first to which we can, with some assurance, attach the name of an editor, but we also learn that John Hughes possessed and advocated the use of the 1667 text. On examining the 1719 edition one finds that Hughes practised what he preached. For the first time the Quarto reading sin (11.427), omitted from the Octavo, has been restored and, for the first time as well, an editor has made eclectic choices between Quarto and Octavo variants. Of the fifteen "indifferent" readings Hughes chose five from the Quarto text (2.282, 4.451, 7.366, 8.269, 10.408), proving conclusively that he used a 1667 copy for correction. Hughes' chief failing as editor, however, is that, though the original texts were available to him and one of them was used to correct copy, he did not consider the advantage of using an original as printer's copy. Like his predecessors Hughes relied on a recent edition (the 1711) which he attempted to correct. And even though he was careful in his treatment, relying on collation rather than intuition, too many (more than thirteen) of the 1711 corruptions escaped his notice. One could argue, of course, that these were allowed to remain on the grounds that they were justifiable, for Hughes himself adds a few minor emendations of his own: eye becomes eyes (1.456), thy becomes by (12.83) and him becomes it (12.93). Whatever the reason, whether carelessness or indifference, it is clear that respect for the authoritative texts has not yet reached the point where conjectural emendation is deemed to be unnecessary or irresponsible. If John Hughes had continued as editor of the 1720 edition of The Poetical Works or if Thomas Tickell (who was paid fifty pounds for the job) had heeded Hughes' advice, more of the progressive errors might have disappeared. At the end of 1719, however, Jacob Tonson retired, leaving his publishing house and rights to his nephew, Jacob Tonson secundus , and John Hughes, who had been ill for much of that year, died in early 1720. This combination of circumstances left the publishing and editing of Paradise Lost in new hands—the publisher concerned with making his own mark by producing another more-handsome two-volume Folio and the editor concerned only with refinement of the accidentals. Tickell, in fact, despite the acclaim he has been accorded as editor of the 1720 edition, 11 merely followed Hughes' 1719 text in almost slavish detail, making no effort to restore authoritative readings and perpetuating every progressive error save three. His only unique contribution is the introduction of eight new emendations of his own: frail becomes fair (2.375), medal becomes metal (3.592), not becomes nor (6.345), last becomes lost (6.797), these becomes the (9.244), bushing becomes blushing (9.426) and one becomes our (10.392). Of these only metal has found any degree of acceptance, the others being, as a later critic termed them, merely "elegant inaccuracies." It is at this point in time, in fact, that liberal emendation becomes the chief characteristic of editorial treatment; conjectural criticism became the "darling passion" of Milton's editors just as it had of Shakespeare's. Elijah Fenton, the editor of the next three editions (1725, 1727 and 1730), was, like his Shakespearian counterpart, Lewis Theobald, an "avaricious husbandman" of emendations. Entirely ignoring the authoritative editions (though he used the 1719 as copy), careless of correction, he forced on the text his own unpoetic barbarisms: inexorably becomes inexorable (2.90), had becomes and (3.110), or yeanling becomes and weanling (3.434), wreck becomes wreak (4.11), breaded becomes braided (4.349), haply becomes happy (8.200) and so forth ad nauseam . Fenton's editorial licentiousness was, in fact, so blatant that even the reading public for the first time took notice. In The Gentleman's Magazine for 1731 his editions were condemned in these terms: "All the various readings of this edition are either mean or trifling, wherefore he [the writer] laments the privilege that rich booksellers have of putting it in the power of any ignorant editor to murder the finest authors" (I, 55). That comment also looks forward to a few months later when a similar reception would be accorded the efforts of the most notorious emendator of the century, Dr. Richard Bentley, and his contumacious edition of 1732. 12 The nature and extent of Bentley's emendations and the angry reception which greeted them have been adequately described by other scholars, among them J. W. Mackail and William Empson. 13 Suffice it to say here that Bentley, the foremost classical scholar of his day, mistakenly treated the text of Paradise Lost as he had those of Horace and Manilius. He assumed that the text was corrupt—indeed, he created a fictitious editor who (Bentley insisted) had corrupted the originals by inserting his own inferior words; it was therefore necessary to purge the text, to undertake a vast programme of emendation "by sagacity and happy conjecture." On more than fifty occasions Bentley rejects whole passages, such as the famous description of the Paradise of Fools in Book III, as non-Miltonic, being the spurious insertions of his fictitious "tamperer"; on more than eight hundred other occasions Bentley emends single words and whole lines, proposing emendations which rid the text of anything his classical mind cannot tolerate: mythological allusions, tautologies and poetic similies. From Book I, line 6, where he alters secret to sacred , to the final lines of the poem, They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way (1667-1731) Then hand in hand with social steps their way Through Eden took with Heav'nly comfort cheer'd (1732) Bentley wielded his editorial scalpel with great abandon. It would be decidedly unfair, of course, not to point out that Bentley's emendations, unlike those of Fenton, were not forced silently into the text, but were "cast into the margins, and explain'd in the Notes, so that every Reader has his free choice, whether he will accept or reject what is here offer'd him." They are, therefore, merely proposals and as such are irrelevant to an examination of the text itself—a text which, Bentley claimed, was the "truest and correctest" that had yet appeared. Like many of Bentley's other claims, however, that one too is false: the text is in fact quite badly handled. The 1720 edition which he used as copy was corrected in an extremely haphazard fashion—partly by intuition, partly against the 1667 and, in a few instances, against the manuscript of Book I; but it was corrected so casually that most of the 1720 corruptions (unique to it and perpetuated by it) were followed. 14 In Book I, for example, the only Book for which a manuscript exists, one finds evidence that Bentley looked at the manuscript (then in Tonson's possession) but did not collate it with the 1667 Quarto text. At 504-05 he offered the manuscript reading as that of the first edition, obviously not knowing there was a difference: MS.: hospitable doors / Yielded thir Matrons to avoide worse rape 4°: hospitable Dores / Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape 8°: the hospitable door / Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse rape. In two instances, by some strange circumstance, Bentley altered correct readings in the 1720 text to accord with faulty 1725 readings ( inexorably becomes inexorable and to becomes too ); whether he was mistakenly emending them in the belief that the 1725 readings were authoritative or whether he was intuitively emending is difficult to say. And at 10.392 and 11.587 he offered correct original readings as emendations, not knowing that what he offered were in fact already authoritative. In only two instances did Bentley improve his text: at 1.703 he became the first editor to choose the Quarto founded , ably defending it in a foot-note, and at 10.550 he restored, for the first time as well, the omitted fair . They do not, however, compensate for the careless inconsistency with which the text, as a whole, is handled. It is very confused and, though an improvement over Fenton's, is little superior to the 1719. Devoid of its marginalia—its hundreds of conjectural emendations—the 1732 edition would have received scant attention. For, quite clearly it was not Bentley's treatment of the actual text which angered such men as Swift and Pope; it was his marginal emendations, his charges of spuriousness, his rigid application of classical principles that roused their ire: "I am so stonish'd, stonied and stunn'd with the Arrogance and Impertinence of the Doctor's Emendations," wrote Swift, "that I have scarce patience to read them." 15 But read them he did and ridiculed them as well in his witty pamphlet, Milton Restor'd and Bentley Depos'd . Others followed that lead and Bentley was derided, lampooned and generally made fun of in such pamphlets as A Friendly Letter to Dr. Bentley and in continuous letters to the Grub-Street Journal . After the smoke of battle had cleared the more sober-minded and scholarly critics, such as Zachary Pearce and Jonathan Richardson, sought out the truth of Bentley's assertions and soundly proved them wrong. The initial editorial reaction, no doubt influenced by the angry denunciation of Bentley and Bentleian conjectural criticism, was to 'play it safe' by producing several uncontroversial editions of Paradise Lost based on Fenton's of 1725-30. Ignoring Bentley's text altogether, even the valuable restoration of fair (10.550) and the acceptable emendations swelling (7.321) and soul (7.451), Jacob Tonson III (who had taken over on the death of his father in 1735) brought out four insignificant editions in 1737, 1738, 1739 and 1741 which were, by and large, mere reprints of the 1727 and 1730 texts, perpetuating their numerous errors and improbable emendations. In 1735 and 1746 three non-Tonson editions appeared, one from Dublin, one from Glasgow and the other from "A Company of Stationers" in London, but all were again mere slavish reprints of their copy-texts (the 1730 and the 1739 editions) and none added anything new to the authoritativeness of the text. In 1747 John Hawkey, a Dublin "editor of the Latin classics", produced an edition which he claimed had been "freed from the blunders and absurdities that had crept into most of the former editions" by consulting the "two authentic" texts, the Quarto and Octavo. By virtue of that statement and, more particularly, because it contained an extensive critical apparatus, Hawkey's edition enjoyed undue esteem for many years. No one checked closely enough to see that his pronouncements were as unreliable as those of Bentley. He had indeed undertaken a superficial collation and had noted a number of errors and variants, but he also made the mistake of using a recent edition (the 1738) as printer's copy, thereby perpetuating more than a dozen substantive corruptions. It was that basic procedural error, the use of a recent edition as copy (corrected largely by intuition), which had thus far prevented the achievement of a definitive text for Paradise Lost : the few textual advances made by casual collation, intuitive correction and "happy conjecture" were more than offset by the retention and transmission of hundreds of corruptions, both compositorial and intentional. It was only in 1749, eighty-two years after Paradise Lost had been given to the world, that Dr. Thomas Newton reversed the process: for the first time the 1667 and 1674 texts, eclectically treated, became the basis for a new edition, the second being the copy-text corrected against the first. As far as the substantive text is concerned, therefore, Newton's magnificent "royal" Quarto edition, cum notis variorum , is as modern-looking as those of Merrett Hughes or Alastair Fowler: every superior 1667 reading has been retrieved, with textual notes being supplied for ten; and of the fifteen "indifferent" readings Newton has chosen eight from the 1667 and seven from the 1674 text, anticipating modern editorial treatment in his reasoned eclecticism. Often his reasons for choosing one or the other are concerned with the "good sense" of the reading, but on occasion they also read like those of a modern textual critic: "shadier / In the second we read In Shadie bower , but with such a space as is not usual between two words, as if the letter r had occupy'd the room, and by some accident had made no impression." The more-than-eighty years of editorial meandering had, of course, produced, in a haphazard fashion, a little information about the original texts, restored a few authoritative readings and provided some necessary emendations: Newton was comprehensively aware of what preceding editors had done to the text and was careful to acknowledge his debts. And, ironically, the greatest debt was owed to Bentley; not for what he had contributed to textual awareness but for the impetus which his edition provided in spurring other scholars to examine the original editions. The Jonathan Richardsons (father and son), in their Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost (1734), and Francis Peck, in his Memoirs of Milton (1740), correctly established the bibliographical history of the first edition and brought attention to the variants between the Quarto and Octavo texts. Newton, in his elaborate critical apparatus, makes frequent mention of their contributions. Newton was, however, an extremely conservative editor—more so than many later nineteenth-century ones and again approaching a modern editorial treatment: "we are cautious," he stated, "about admitting any alterations into the text of Milton." The substantive emendations that he did accept were all seen to be admissible on the grounds that the originals obscured the author's meaning: metal (3.592: 1720), soul (7.451: 1695) and too (9.854: 1725). In several other instances, where the original readings are not hopelessly obscured but where emendations would improve the sense ( lost , 6.797; swelling , 7.321; thing , 7.452; and held , 6.580), Newton, as every good editor must, relegated his preferred readings to his critical apparatus. Newton's 1749 edition is, then, in the true sense of the term a "critical edition"; for even though he was primarily concerned with annotative elucidation, he was nevertheless careful to print his text "correctly according to Milton's own editions." He diligently collated the two originals, used only them as the basis for his own, made known the important cruxes, allowed a minimum of emendation, treated the indifferent readings eclectically (as all modern editors do), provided an extensive critical apparatus and, most important, supplied a definitive substantive text: there was no reason why, as Newton himself asserted, any future editor should be "left floating in the wide sea of conjecture." For the next century, therefore, though there were individualistic deviations, Newton's edition remained the standard and accepted one. There were, of course, still some textual and bibliographic discoveries to be made, but the substantive text itself was so securely definitive that twentieth-century editors could concern themselves with the accidentals—with establishing Milton's intentions regarding the spelling and punctuation.</field>

I would add that, though Darbishire's list of variants is comprehensive and the reader, for convenience, is therefore referred to it, the list of substantive variants which follow is based on my own collation of the original texts and on a study of how subsequent editors have treated them. 3 W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," SB , 3 (1950-51), 21. 4 The only interesting question raised by the third edition is why Simmons, who obviously knew the state of the Quarto and Octavo better than anyone, did not restore any authoritative readings. It is too large a question to tackle in this paper. 5 Simmons sold his rights to Brabazon Aylmer in 1680 and he, in turn, sold them to Tonson. See J. Milton French, The Life Records of John Milton , V (1958), 264. 6 There are three distinct title-pages for the fourth edition, all bearing the 1688 date and differing only in the imprint. The first carries Tonson's name only; the second the name of Tonson's partner, Richard Bently; and the third carries both names. 7 The fifth edition exists with two title pages, one dated 1691 and the second dated 1692. There is but one edition, however, the second being simply a re-issue of the 1691 text. 8 On the title-page to Paradise Lost the title of Hume's commentary is "Explanatory Notes"; on its own separate title-page it is called "Annotations on Each Book of the Paradise Lost." The former is the one most often used today. 9 Milton's Editors and Commentators , pp. 47-49. 10 Milton's Poetical Works , Vol. IV, 5th ed.

This is the first non-Tonson edition, by George Grierson of Dublin. It is an unprepossessing duodecimo, based on Tonson's 1720, and adds nothing to our knowledge of the text. After 1730 non-Tonson editions began to appear more frequently. 13 Mackail, "Bentley's Milton," Proceedings of the British Academy , 11 (1924-25), 56-73; Empson, "Milton and Bentley," in Some Versions of Pastoral (London, 1935), pp. 149-191. 14 The 1720 copy used by Bentley is now housed in the Cambridge University Library. It does not, however, appear to be the one used as printer's copy; there are too many discrepancies between the corrections in it and those which finally appear in Bentley's text. 15 Milton Restor'd and Bentley Depos'd (1732), p. 23.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Chronology of the Richardson-Bradshaigh Correspondence of 1751 by John August Wood</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Samuel Richardson and Dorothy Bradshaigh began an exchange of letters in 1748 when she, feeling "for the virtuous in distress" and apprehending "a fatal catastrophe," wrote him to plead that Clarissa not be subjected to "rapes, ruin, and destruction." If Richardson disappointed her, she cursed him to "meet with applause only from envious old maids, surly bachelors, and tyrannical parents." She also informed him that she was no "giddy girl of sixteen" and that if he took her for a "fool" for having written him, she did not "care a straw." 1 Though Richardson did not heed her curse and went on to have his heroine raped, ruined, and destroyed, there developed between him and Lady Bradshaigh the warmest of friendships and a correspondence that continued until his death in 1761. Their early correspondence was devoted to Clarissa and much of their later correspondence to the composition of Sir Charles Grandison , a work Lady Bradshaigh had urged upon him. Of Richardson's many correspondents Lady Bradshaigh was the "most beloved and revered," 2 and, consequently, his letters to her present a highly revealing portrait of himself and his art. And her argumentative but always warm letters, in reflecting the sensibilities of the age, are an important social document, for they are among the earliest examples of a public reaction against the avant-garde artist, a reaction common now in the twentieth century. Though Richardson is often stereotyped as a rather conventional sentimentalist, he developed a new genre, revealed his characters, in anticipation of the modern novel, through their psychology, and shaped plots, certainly in Clarissa , that were daring for his time. Though many of Richardson's and Lady Bradshaigh's letters are preserved in Mrs. Barbauld's six volume Correspondence and in the Forster Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, they represent perhaps only one-third of those Richardson and Lady Bradshaigh exchanged. In her Life of Samuel Richardson which prefaces the Correspondence , Mrs. Barbauld writes that Lady Bradshaigh's letters "together with Richardson's answers, would alone make several volumes, I believe as many as the whole of this publication" (I, ccviii). In addition to the fact that most of the letters have been lost to them, scholars are further hampered by the confused state in which the preserved letters exist. Richardson and Lady Bradshaigh both tampered with them, as did Mrs. Barbauld, whose edition contains numerous misdated, composite, and cut letters. 3 Among the most important and the most confused of Richardson's and Lady Bradshaigh's letters are those of 1751. Eaves and Kimpel write that "some of the letters to Lady Bradshaigh, especially during the time of the composition of Grandison , seem to be much more confused than the others," and that those of 1751 are in "utter confusion" (pp. 439 &amp; 657). This confusion actually begins with Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 25 November 1750 and continues through hers of 3 January 1752. I have attempted to straighten out that confusion by separating the composite letters, rejoining them to their originals where they exist, arranging the letters in chronological order, and dating them as precisely as I could on the basis of internal evidence. Though I occasionally disagree with the calendar of correspondence published as the Appendix to Eaves' and Kimpel's monumental study of Richardson's life and work, without it I would have found the prospect of establishing the chronology of the 1751 letters absolutely hopeless. The following chart compares Mrs. Barbauld's, Professors Eaves' and Kimpel's, and my arrangement of the letters. It is followed by an explanation of how I arrived at the chronology and established the dates in my arrangement.

      <field name="fulltext">B to R 25 Nov. 1750 (B, VI, 40-42, 45-48; FM, XI, ff. 19-20); B to R Late Feb. (B, VI, 42-45). As it is printed in the Correspondence , Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 25 Nov. 1750 is a composite. It contains material not in the version in the Forster Collection as well as passages at variance with it. The manuscript also contains some short passages not in the printed version. When one compares complete letters that exist both in the Forster Collection and the Correspondence , one can see how Mrs. Barbauld often attempted to improve upon the correspondents' phrasing and style; therefore, when variants exist, the manuscript version must be taken as the more authoritative one. Lady Bradshaigh's discussion of the "moderate rake" (B, VI, 42-45) is not answered by Richardson until his letter of 14 March. The frequency of their correspondence, their hastiness to answer and argue, the fact that the "moderate rake" passage does not appear in the manuscript, and the internal evidence found in Richardson's reply leave no room to doubt that Lady Bradshaigh's reflections on the "moderate rake" were written in late February. An early March dating is unlikely since there exists an early March letter from her. There is also no room to doubt that Richardson's letter of 14 March is his reply to the interpolation as printed in the 25 Nov. letter. For the sake of argument he directly quoted from her letter saying, "Well, but for fear I should be called scurrilous again, let me see how your Ladyship explains yourself.—'A man may DESERVE the name of a rake, without being QUITE an abandoned profligate ; as a man may sometimes drink A LITTLE TOO MUCH without being a sot " (B, VI, 64; cf., B, VI, 42-43). 4 Richardson then went on to paraphrase other of her passages and to reply to them. The passage interpolated into the 25 Nov. letter in addition to having had to have come before Richardson's letter of 14 March can be shown to have had to have come after her letter of 9 Feb. and Richardson's Feb. reply. After her discussion of the "moderate rake" there are two paragraphs, one dealing with "prudent girls" and another with the "age," that are clarifications of passages that appear in the last paragraph of her letter of 9 Feb. (B, VI, 44-45; cf., B, VI, 74-75). On 9 Feb. she had written of "our prudent girls, whose number, I hope, is not a few, even in such an age as this, which age you are to understand I do not think worse than former ages." Lady Bradshaigh's first full paragraph on B, VI, 44 clarifies her meaning of "prudent" and continues her discussion of rakes. The paragraph also reaffirms her statement on the age with the words, "I do not really, Sir, think this age worse than former ages." These two passages place the interpolated section in the 25 Nov. letter after her letter of 9 February. Lady Bradshaigh's next paragraph, though, places the interpolation as having been written not only after her 9 Feb. letter but also after Richardson's Feb. reply to it. Richardson's reply had included the sentence "Why, I attempted to draw a good woman; and the poor phantom has set half her own sex against her" (B, VI, 82). Lady Bradshaigh opens the first paragraph on B, VI, 45 saying, "But do not say, Sir, that 'by drawing a good woman you have set half her sex against her.' I protest I cannot bear it. You are downright scurrilous." This passage not only places the interpolation after Richardson's Feb. reply but also unites the entire interpolated section (B, VI, 42-45) by supplying the evidence to show that it is also from the "moderate rake" letter. The "sot" passage I quoted from Richardson's 14 March reply to Lady Bradshaigh opened with the words "Well, but for fear I should be called scurrilous again." This sentence allows us to see that Richardson was replying to material in both the first and the last paragraphs of the interpolation; we can, therefore, conclude that the entire interpolation is one whole fragment from a missing letter. The various pieces of internal evidence, then, establish that B, VI, 42-45 of Lady Bradshaigh's 25 Nov. 1750 letter does not belong with it but belongs between Richardson's letters of Feb. and 14 March. The 25 Nov. 1750 letter, therefore, is B, VI, 40-42, 45-48 and FM, XI, ff. 19-20, with the Forster manuscript version being the preferred text when discrepancies between the two exist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B Dec. (B, VI, 121-123). Richardson probably answered Lady Bradshaigh's 25 Nov. letter in his of Dec., but only a fragment of that letter is preserved. That fragment (B, VI, 121-123) appears in the undated letter Mrs. Barbauld placed after Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 16 April and is the passage Eaves and Kimpel date [Dec.-Jan.] and place after the letter they refer to as Lady Bradshaigh's [28 Dec.]. Richardson begins it by telling Lady Bradshaigh, "I am at present engaged with a most admirable young Lady of little more than twenty, Miss Mulso, on the subject of paternal authority, and filial obedience." He continues through B, VI, 123 speaking of Miss Mulso and their discussion, and he tells Lady Bradshaigh that "when Miss Mulso and I have got through our debate, I shall long to have your Ladyship's opinion of it." Though Richardson's replies are lost, Hester Mulso's three letters on "paternal authority, and filial obedience" are preserved in the Posthumous Works of Mrs. Chapone (1808). Her three letters are dated 12 Oct. (II, 29-34), 10 Nov. (II, 37-85), and 3 Jan. (II, 89-143). Richardson had not received Miss Mulso's last letter by the time he wrote Lady Bradshaigh since, as he told her, he and Miss Mulso had not yet gotten through their debate. This places Richardson's letter before he would have received Miss Mulso's of 3 January. But Lady Bradshaigh answers Richardson and tells him she "should be greatly delighted to see the correspondence" (B, VI, 52) in a segment of her 6 Jan. letter that she dated 28 December. Richardson's letter, therefore, had to have been received by Lady Bradshaigh after she posted her 25 Nov. letter but on or before 28 December. The possibility of the January dating that Eaves and Kimpel suggest is, therefore, eliminated. With little conjecture one can also eliminate the possibility of Richardson's letter having been written in late November. Lady Bradshaigh's 6 Jan. letter was begun on 26 December or earlier because she dates an internal section 27 December. Her letter opens with an answer to a question Richardson had asked probably in the letter from which the fragment came. It is highly doubtful that had she received a late November letter from Richardson, she would have waited until late December to answer it or had she begun a letter in early December, she would have waited until late December to complete it and early January to post it. When there were lapses of this length in their correspondence, they always faithfully explained the reasons for them. It is fairly certain then that Richardson's passage about Miss Mulso is taken from a letter written to Lady Bradshaigh in December of 1750.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B to R 6 Jan. (B, VI, 49-57). Richardson himself dates this letter of Lady Bradshaigh's in his answer to hers of 9 February. He continues their argument about "learning in women" and, quoting from her earlier letter, writes, "In your Ladyship's, of January 6, you say, 'I hate to hear Latin out of a woman's mouth . . .'" (B, VI, 79; cf., B, VI, 53). But considering that the complete letter (B, VI, 49-57) also contains the dates 27 Dec. and 28 Dec., one might wonder if this is not another of Mrs. Barbauld's composites. Fortunately, though, there is sufficient internal evidence to prove that it is not. As I pointed out earlier, the 28 Dec. section is a reply to Richardson's December letter about Miss Mulso. But the 6 Jan. section is also a reply to that letter. The passage Richardson quoted and dated as 6 Jan. is followed in Lady Bradshaigh's letter by a direct quotation from Richardson's December letter: "You say 'the men are hastening a pace into dictionary learning.' The less occasion for the ladies to proceed in their's" (B, VI, 53; cf., B, VI, 122). This establishes that the 28 Dec. and 6 Jan. sections are from a single letter written in reply to Richardson's of December. The undated section written prior to the one dated 27 Dec. also belongs with the 6 Jan. letter. A passage from the undated section and a passage at the conclusion of the 6 Jan. letter are both references to her 25 Nov. letter and obviously are replies to missing portions of Richardson's of December. The letter of 25 Nov. ends with a comment on the two plays of Richardson's friend, Edward Young. Richardson must not have responded as she had planned, for she writes in a paragraph prior to the 27 Dec. section, "I only meant to joke a little upon Dr. Young; not to be severe." Also toward the end of the 25 Nov. letter she asks Richardson not to "forget" her "poor Magdalene." In the penultimate paragraph of her 6 Jan. letter she writes, "I am afraid, Sir, I have given you too much trouble about the poor Madgdalene." These two passages unite the undated section and the 6 Jan. section as replies to comments Richardson must have made in December. Richardson's Feb. letter, then, establishes the date of this letter as 6 Jan., and internal evidence establishes that though it was written on at least four separate days, it is a complete letter in reply to Richardson's of December.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B Jan. (B, VI, 57-62); B to R 9 Feb. (B, VI, 69-75); B to R 17 March (B, VI, 75-77); R to B 24 March (B, VI, 85-89). Richardson's Jan. letter presents no problems other than it is incomplete. It is his reply to Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 6 Jan. and it contains numerous references to it. She answers this letter in hers of 9 Feb., but through her quotations and references, one can see that she is addressing herself to some passages in Richardson's letter that are lost. Lady Bradshaigh's 9 Feb. letter also presents no problems since it is dated, it answers Richardson's Jan. letter, and it is answered by Richardson's Feb. letter, which includes direct quotations from it and replies to it. Mrs. Barbauld printed Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 17 March at the end of her 9 Feb. letter as if it were a continuation, but that was in error since the 9 Feb. letter is answered by Richardson's of February and the 17 March letter is answered by Richardson's of 24 March.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B Feb. (B, VI, 77-84); B to R 5 March (FM, XI, f. 21). Though Eaves and Kimpel refer to Richardson's Feb. letter as a [Feb.-March] letter, a March dating is unlikely because the letter answers Lady Bradshaigh's of 9 Feb. and because Lady Bradshaigh then answers it in B, VI, 42-45 and then writes Richardson again on 5 March. Had Richardson's letter been written even on 1 March, there would not have been time for it to have been received by Lady Bradshaigh, answered by her, and then followed by another letter from her on 5 March. It generally took about seven days for their letters to arrive; therefore, a March dating on B, VI, 77-84 is not possible. Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 5 March requests the first installment of Grandison . Richardson must already have sent it because it arrived between 5 and 14 March. Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 17 March thanks Richardson for it, which she found when she returned home "on Thursday last," which would have been 14 March.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B 14 March (B, VI, 62-68, omit first paragraph p. 64) Lady Bradshaigh's Late Feb. letter is answered by Richardson's of 14 March. The first paragraph on B, VI, 64 comes from a letter of some years earlier replying to Lady Bradshaigh's request "To reform Lovelace for Clarissa's sake!" Though Eaves and Kimpel identify this letter as a [Mid-March??] letter, a more precise dating is possible. The last paragraph of the letter was written at 11:00 on a Thursday morning Richardson tells Lady Bradshaigh. The Thursdays in March of 1751 fell on the 7 th , the 14 th , the 21 st , and the 28 th . The 28 th can be immediately eliminated because the letter in question is an answer to Lady Bradshaigh's of Late Feb., and Richardson had already answered her next letter, that of 17 March, in his letter of 24 March. The 7 th can be eliminated with equal ease because had the letter been written on that date, it would have been received by 17 March and answered in Lady Bradshaigh's of that date, but she does not answer Richardson's letter until 29 March. With little conjecture, one can also eliminate the 21 st . The letter in question was written in answer to a letter from Lady Bradshaigh of Late February, a letter he probably would not have waited three weeks to answer without giving an explanation as to why. Most likely before Richardson had received Lady Bradshaigh's Late Feb. letter he had already sent her the first installment of Grandison . He then wrote her on 14 March to answer her previous letter. Her letter of 5 March requesting Grandison probably arrived on 12 March or after. It would certainly have arrived by 18 March, and he would certainly have known that Grandison was in her hands by that date. She, in fact, had it on 14 March and had read it by 17 March when she wrote Richardson. Knowing these various dates, it is difficult to imagine that were Richardson's letter written on 21 March he would not have posed her the important question he reserved for his letter of 24 March: "But my Harriot!—and do you, can you like the girl?" (B, VI, 85). One can, therefore, be relatively certain that Richardson's reply to Lady Bradshaigh's Late Feb. letter was written on 14 March.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B to R 29 March (B, VI, 90-96); B to R 8 April (B, VI, 96-101; FM, XI, ff. 22-23). Mrs. Barbauld printed the 29 March and 8 April letters as a single letter, but from the existence of a manuscript of the 8 April portion with a dated postscript and from the fact that B, VI, 90-96, l. 20, answers Richardson's letter of 14 March and that B, VI, 96-101 answers his letter of 24 March, one can be assured that this is another of Mrs. Barbauld's composites.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B to R 16 April (B, VI, 106-109, 110-116). The letter Mrs. Barbauld printed between Lady Bradshaigh's 29 March and 16 April letters, (B, VI, 101-109), is a terribly confused composite of three letters. One long paragraph, (B, VI, 106-108), which deals with a young woman forced into marriage, and the two paragraphs following it belong with Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 16 April. She first tells Richardson of the young woman on 8 April in her dated postscript. Her letter of 16 April, as it is printed by Mrs. Barbauld, discusses various characters in Grandison , but it makes no mention of the young woman. In her next letter, that of May-June, she again writes of the young woman and says, "She [Lady Bradshaigh's niece] is well acquainted with the sad story related to you in my two last" (B, VI, 126-127). And she then goes on to discuss the story in greater detail. The young woman story, (B, VI, 106-108), first related to Richardson on 8 April must, therefore, belong with Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 16 April. The two paragraphs following the young woman story also seem to belong with the 16 April letter. The only other possibilities are the Late May-June or the 3 Jan. 1752 letter, and neither of those seem likely. The first of those paragraphs deal with Richardson's Rambler , no. 97, which appeared on 19 February. Lady Bradshaigh had just encountered "a very sensible lady" who "happened to be in town when it was published" and was "greatly pleased" with it. Considering that the previous paragraph had come from the letter of 16 April, considering that the "sensible lady" would have been telling Lady Bradshaigh about a 19 February Rambler in April far more likely than she would have been in late May, early June, or January of the following year, and considering that the lengthy B, VI, 101-109 ends with the words "I find I have finished two sheets, and positively I will not begin another," thereby making B, VI, 101-105 with the addition of B, VI, 108 too long, one can conclude that the passage on the Rambler of 19 Feb. belongs with the 16 April letter. The following paragraph, for some of the same reasons and the fact that it deals with Lady Bradshaigh's Magdalen, for whom she has finally found a "place," is probably placed in the 16 April letter and certainly placed before late May, June, or the following January.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B May (B, VI, 116-121); B to R May-June (B, VI, 123-127). Richardson's letter of May answers Lady Bradshaigh's of 8 April and makes references to hers of 16 April. Eaves and Kimpel date the letter [Apr.-Oct.?], but a May dating can be made upon the basis of what Richardson says in the first paragraph about his health. He writes, "I have passed more than a month of grievous and incapacitating suffering. Behind-hand with all my correspondencies; and almost careless of business." On 25 March Richardson wrote both Mrs. Chapone and Philip Skelton, and he was obviously in good health. He must have fallen ill in late March or early April because no letter written between 25 March and 2 May from Richardson exists. By 2 May, though, he had recovered and wrote his friend Thomas Edwards, who replied on 8 May telling Richardson that he was glad that he was once again well. From his words to Lady Bradshaigh, "I have passed more than a month . . . ," it is obvious that he was writing her immediately upon his recovery. She answers Richardson in either May or June. It is difficult to be more precise because she wrote, "I have been the longer in sending this, because you said you were behind-hand with all your correspondencies." She sends her prayers for his health, and then she writes of the young woman whom she had spoken of in "two last." This places her letter before hers of Late May-June, which Eaves and Kimpel place after it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B to R Late May-June 1751 (B, VI, 101-105, 109). Lady Bradshaigh's Late May-June letter makes one of her "very best courtesies" to Sir Charles Grandison, whom Richardson has finally introduced to her. From the fact that Sir Charles has finally appeared and from Richardson's other letters, this letter can be placed as having been written in late May or in June. On 2 May Richardson wrote Thomas Edwards, "After long, long Traveling I think I have found ye good Man; just found him: But you, Sir, &amp; an auxiliary Lady or two must correct, adorn &amp; finish him" (FM, XII, I, ff. 99-100). The "auxiliary Lady" was, of course, Lady Bradshaigh. Richardson had, in fact, described him to her in May as " your good man (your's he is—he owes the existence he has to you)", and so Richardson would have obviously sent her the character as soon as he had finished him. Lady Bradshaigh in her letter of Late May-June declines, though, to "correct, adorn &amp; finish him" with the words "I 'tell you what I would have done!' Dear Sir, ask your own mind what I would have done: the dictates of that must be what I would have done" (B, VI, 102). Considering the circumstances and these words, Lady Bradshaigh's letter was probably written about the same time Richardson wrote Thomas Edwards. It is hard to imagine that it was written after 1 July, for around that date Sir Charles was given to the world, via a reading which Susanna Highmore was present at and recorded in a letter to Hester Mulso. (See Eaves and Kimpel, p. 372.) By 11 July Richardson himself had written Miss Mulso about Sir Charles. He would certainly have given Sir Charles to Lady Bradshaigh before Miss Mulso, and since he wanted Lady Bradshaigh to help "correct" Sir Charles, it is virtually impossible to imagine that he would have given the public reading before she had met the character. Lady Bradshaigh's letter, therefore, must have been written in late May or June of 1751.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R to B 26 Dec. 1751 (B, VI, 128-137); B to R 3 Jan. 1752 (B, VI, 105-106, 137-146). Richardson's letter of 26 Dec. presents no problems, nor does Lady Bradshaigh's of 3 Jan. 1752, other than that B, VI, 105, l. 7-B, VI, 106, l. 21 belongs with it. Those two paragraphs, through their use of direct quotations from and answers to Richardson's letter of 26 Dec., can easily be seen to be part of Lady Bradshaigh's letter of 3 January.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Typewriters in the Making of The Waste Land by S. Krishnamoorthy Aithal</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Valerie Eliot's facsimile edition (1971) of the drafts of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land has provided an impetus to critics to trace the origin and growth of the poem. The typewriters used by Eliot to copy the poem have gained a certain amount of significance in this bibliographic study. Mrs. Eliot's reproduction of the drafts reveals that Eliot used different typewriters for transcription, and this knowledge, assisted by the knowledge of other external and internal evidence, has enabled critics to unravel at what periods, in what places, in what sequence the different parts of the poem were written. Grover Smith and Hugh Kenner describe, on the basis of the typewriters, and, of course, on the basis of extensive evidence, external and internal, how the poem slowly took shape and developed into its present form. 1 I wish to return to the typewriters as I find myself in disagreement with one particular observation and conclusion made by Mr. Smith and Mr. Kenner in respect of the machine related to Parts I and II. Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Kenner are of the opinion that Parts I and II were written in Lausanne where Eliot had gone for rest and treatment between the last week of November and the middle of December. Mr. Smith thinks that Eliot carried his portable typewriter to Lausanne and typed these Parts. Mr. Kenner thinks that Eliot got some typewriter in Lausanne to make a fair copy of the parts. I have difficulty in accepting the above contentions. It seems to me very unlikely that Eliot carried his portable typewriter with him to Lausanne when he was in a poor state of health and was going there for treatment. If he had his typewriter with him, or if some other typewriter was available to him, it is rather puzzling why he did not type Parts IV and V also on it, and why he used Pound's machine to type them in Paris on his journey back to London. Although one cannot say definitely just when Part IV was written, it has been pointed out by Mr. Smith that the quality of the paper Eliot used to make a holograph fair copy is identical to the paper used for Part V, which, from internal evidence, could be seen to have been written at Lausanne. Eliot thus took pains to make a neat copy of Parts IV and V at Lausanne. It seems to me reasonable to suppose that he would have used a typewriter to make a fair copy, if one were available. Mr. Smith and Mr. Kenner have no satisfactory explanation to give why Eliot typed Parts I and II in Lausanne, and why he could not do Parts IV and V. The situation does not seem to worry Mr. Smith. It seems odd that Eliot should carry his typewriter to Paris, and use Pound's, instead of his own, to transcribe Parts IV and V. Mr. Kenner does notice the anomalous situation, but he says that Eliot could not use the typewriter for Parts IV and V, as it suddenly became unavailable. I tend to believe that Eliot had no typewriter at his disposal at Lausanne. Neither had he carried his, nor was someone else's typewriter available to him. Parts I and II, like Part III, were, in my view, composed in London, and Eliot had typescripts for all the three Parts before he left for Lausanne on November 18, 1921. If my conjecture is correct, although I do not have, at present, any concrete evidence to prove it, a new picture would emerge of the unfolding history of The Waste Land . If Part III did precede Parts I and II, as Mr. Kenner and Mr. Smith argue, there could not have been a long gap between the composition of the three Parts. It would be, therefore, wide off the mark to identify London, the theme of Part III, as the original theme of the poem, as Mr. Kenner does. In my view Eliot's original conception of the poem was bolder and far more complex than what Mr. Kenner makes it out to be.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of D. H. Lawrence's Saga of Siegmund by Bruce Steele</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D. H. Lawrence's second novel The Trespasser was composed initially in just over three months in mid-1910, and re-worked for publication early in 1912. Based centrally on the diary of Helen Corke's five days at Freshwater, I.O.W. with 'Siegmund', and further stimulated by Lawrence's intimate friendship and conversations with 'Helena', this novel must stand in unique relationship to its 'originals' and their story. 1 Lawrence first heard of Miss Corke's experience and 'Siegmund's' suicide 2 in the late autumn of 1909, probably in November, and in his attempts to bring her "back to life" during winter and early spring of 1910, his fascination with the story grew to the point where he gained her permission to use her Freshwater Diary as the basis of a novel. It seems clear that the novel was begun during the fortnight after the Easter school-holiday, 1910. Since Easter itself fell on March 28th, the novel could not have been started before the latter half of April. 3 Once started, however, Lawrence wrote it with speed and concentration: he referred to "the rapid work of three months" (CL 66. Cf. ED 100-101; WT 233). Miss Corke reports variously that it was finished in "June" and "early July". 4 However a letter from Lawrence to Grace Lovat Fraser dated August 4th 1910 states: "I have just finished my second novel." 5 The context of the letter makes it unlikely that the book was finished on August 4th; however, it is clear that the correct time should be "early August". A period from late April to the first days of August is easily considered a round "three months". At this stage the manuscript was entitled The Saga of Siegmund . During the school holidays it was shown briefly to Jessie Chambers, who had little to say of it (ICI, 184. Cf. ET 181-182; 189), and then passed to Ford Maddox Hueffer, who took it to Germany with him in September—October 1910. 6 Lawrence, after a worrying few weeks, was relieved, on October 18th, to discover that it had safely reached Sydney Pawling of Heinemann's (WT 235; CL 66, 88). However, it lay in Heinemann's office, probably only partly read, for a year. In October 1911 Lawrence offered to show the work to his new friend and mentor Edward Garnett. It took until December for the manuscript to reach Lawrence from Pawling. He immediately sent it on, unopened, with a covering letter to Garnett (CL 86). Garnett encouraged him to revise and re-write, and this he began on December 30th. The revised work was ready for Duckworth in February 1912, and Lawrence accepted the offer to publish on March 18th (CL 102-103). The first proofs arrived in Eastwood on April 4th (CL 107). The novel was published on May 23rd 1912 with the title The Trespasser in error for A Game of Forfeits (CL 124). It is clear that work on The Trespasser falls into two clear periods separated by some 16 months during most of which the manuscript was not in Lawrence's possession. The first writing of The Saga of Siegmund , rapid and intense work, could not have been revised or rewritten until the well-documented revision of January-February 1912. Had Lawrence written another quite independent version, some allusion to it in letters would be likely. There is none, but there is plenty of evidence for other works during 1911, in particular Paul Morel . The surviving manuscripts of The Trespasser closely confirm the documentary evidence for two versions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It is our good fortune that so much of the manuscript material of The Trespasser still exists. There are two collections of manuscript pages, 7 now in the possession of the Bancroft Library in the University of California at Berkeley. The first collection, numbered 2A by Powell in 1937 8 and E407 a. by Roberts in 1963, 9 consists of 485 leaves of ruled notebook paper written in ink on one side. It is a complete manuscript in Lawrence's hand, frequently heavily revised, and carrying on page 1 the heading: The Trespasser. A Novel. / by D. H. Lawrence. / 13. Queen's Square. / Eastwood. Notts. The title itself may not be in Lawrence's own hand, 10 but the signature and address are certainly his. Markings and notes within the manuscript make it certain that this was the copy used by Duckworth's printer Billings and Son to set the first edition. 11 The pagination runs 1-487 as observed by both Powell and Tedlock. Tedlock, however, notes that "five pages bear two numbers, reducing the total to 482" (EWT 7). The five leaves so numbered are 55 &amp; 56, 101 &amp; 102, 137 &amp; 138, 212 &amp; 213, 254 &amp; 255. He appears to have overlooked the following leaves: 124A (following 124), 228a (following 228), and two consecutive leaves numbered 261. Thus there are, as an independent count confirms, 485 leaves in all. This manuscript (hereafter referred to as A) is a composite one, made up of 189 'new' leaves and 296 leaves carefully renumbered from their place in a former sequence and containing varying amounts of revision. The 'new' leaves might be taken to be simply revised fair copy, but there is not one which does not contain some alteration, correction or cancellation. It is possible that the five leaves with paired numbers, listed above, represent the compression of two leaves in a previous version, since they all occur among the 'new' leaves. In all, the new leaves must be those parts of the novel which were so in need of revision as to make re-writing necessary. The 296 leaves retained from an earlier stage of composition belonged to a sequence numbered [1]-503. In each case the earlier numbering is legible, but the leaves have been given, where necessary, a new number corresponding to their place in the A sequence. Thus 190 leaves numbered originally 314-503 (corresponding to pages 181-292 of the printed novel) are renumbered 298-487 in A. This suggests, inter alia, that although the last third of the novel was revised, often heavily, for publication, it was not at length re-written. The second collection, Powell 2B, Roberts E407.b, consists of 182 leaves of similar ruled notebook paper, written in ink on one side in Lawrence's hand. The pagination shows them originally to have belonged to a sequence running [1]-313, but of which 131 leaves are now absent. After page 115 (present in sequence), the extant leaves have been additionally numbered in a new sequence, so that 127 (the next existing leaf) also carried the number 116—and so on through to 313 which is also numbered 207. There is one exception to this: original 129 remains in place as 129 without the addition of 118. It is 132 (the next surviving leaf) which carries the expected revision, 118. Original 171 carries the additional new number 129. It appears that someone has attempted a complete sequential pagination for these fragments, and succeeded in giving the erroneous impression that there are 207 pages in the set. 12 Tedlock, in 1948, makes no reference to this re-numbering, so that it was probably done after the manuscript left Frieda Lawrence's possession. Tedlock's statement, Pages 25-34, 49, 55, 89-90, 116-126, 130-131, 140-146, 148-153, 155-169, 198-201, 203-207, 245-264, 275-276, 279-309, 311-312 (total 119) missing from sequence 13-313 (EWT 11), agrees with the count of 182 extant leaves given here. Powell in 1937, however, recorded 225 leaves in this collection, or 43 pages more than Tedlock found in 1948. But Powell also noted that leaves 477-84 were missing from A. They were present in Tedlock's count in 1948 and are present today. If we assume that in 1937 these were in fact among the B collection, this reduces Powell's figure to 217—still 35 more than in 1948 and now. It suggests that 35 leaves were removed or lost from the B fragments between the Los Angeles exhibition of 1937 and Tedlock's survey of 1948. It is clear from what follows that all but 25 leaves of the original 313-leaf sequence of B do exist and that these 25 leaves although missing can at least be placed in a sequence. The remaining 10 of Powell's count are still a mystery: there would seem to be no place for them in a sequence. Since A is the printer's copy, and the differences between it and the printed text are ascribable to Lawrence's proof corrections, the requirements of house-style, or Duckworth's editor, the B fragments can only represent rejected leaves from an earlier version. They may in fact be remnants of The Saga of Siegmund as Lawrence wrote it in 1910—the version shown to a disapproving Ford Madox Hueffer and submitted to Pawling at Heinemann's. The note on the back of leaf B 180 (138), rightly taken by Tedlock to be in Garnett's hand, 13 indicates that this version was the one submitted to Garnett prior to the re-writing at Bournemouth. The manuscripts themselves offer further support for this view. The original pagination of the fragments—[1]-313 (Tedlock's 13-313 extended back to 1) can be seen in Table I. It is evident that 25 leaves (1-12, 25-34, 55, 311-312) are missing, believed lost, that 182 leaves are intact in the B collection, and that 106 leaves are absent from the sequence. If we examine the A leaves 48, 95-96, 119-128 (incl. 124A), 131-132, 140-146, 148-153, 155-169 (incl. 161 twice), 192-195, 197-201, 231-250, 259-260, 263-293, we find that these 106 leaves also bear in correct sequence the cancelled numbers from B, shown in the table as leaves transferred. Furthermore, if we examine the remaining leaves of A, the printer's copy, numbered 298-487 in the present pagination, we discover that they carry complete the cancelled numbers of the sequence 314-503, i.e. 189 pages. It is clear, then, that what documentary evidence points to as the only re-writing of the novel, done with the encouragement and criticism of Edward Garnett early in 1912, was only in part an actual re-writing—189 'new' leaves, in fact. For the rest, 296 leaves were taken over from the earlier version with varying amounts of correction, deletion and re-casting. Of the leaves taken over into A it is not now always possible to determine in every case which alterations were made as "running revisions" or as first-stage corrections, and which belong to the "re-writing" of 1912. When this evidence of the manuscripts is placed beside the documentary evidence it appears highly probable that the originally numbered leaves 1-503 do contain The Saga of Siegmund . Further corroborative evidence is to be found in some of the handwritten notes on the back of certain leaves of the manuscripts. They are among those recorded by Tedlock (EWT 7, 11). In the B collection the notes refer by number to leaves in that collection, and the passages are identifiable in the manuscript. Those in the present A collection are difficult to make sense of until we first realize that they occur on leaves renumbered from the old sequence, and refer to passages on leaves in that original sequence. A full discussion of these notes is not necessary here, but some examples will suffice. In each case the note is Garnett's. On the back of A260 (formerly B276) appears P. 272 ?Bromios/? too recondite. A272 makes no sense of this; B272, contains three references to Bromios 14 in a passage re-written in A, deleted presumably because the reference was indeed too recondite. Whereas in the context of Euripides The Bacchae (trans. G. Murray), which Lawrence had been reading with Helen Corke in the period of the Freshwater Diary, the reference is clear, since Lawrence is 'placing' Helena (Sieglinde) as a devotee of Bromios (Dionysus); in the context of the novel this is too great a leap, and Lawrence recasts the passage (T 158, par. 1). Again, on the back of A238 (formerly B252) the note reads: P. 242 Not a good metaphor / or too crudely expressing. A242 is no help, but B242 has a vivid reference to the rising moon as a 'red goblet', a metaphor which is developed in the ensuing lines. Although elements of the original metaphor and its implications are still present in the passage (the conclusion of Chapter XVI), it is less boldly ('crudely') expressed in A and so in T. On the back of A356 (formerly B372) we find: P. 367 not so good—this imagery. A367 has little imagery, and no evidence of that little being altered in any way (T 221, last par.). However B367 (A351) shows some three attempts to find the right imagery to describe Siegmund's life on his return home T212, 1st par.). In each of these cases (and there are others) it will be seen that notes listed by Tedlock as notes in A, where they indeed now are, refer in fact to B pages, and therefore belong to the period before the A revision when the B or 'Saga' manuscript was still intact. That almost all the notes are in Garnett's hand shows that they date from the period of his reading the Saga in December 1911, immediately before Lawrence's re-writing. Some problems still remain. The missing pages, two groups of them, are puzzling. The first group of 25 pages was classified above as 'missing, believed lost'. A little light is shed on the problem by some bibliographical considerations. It is well known that in his early novels, stories, poems and plays, written during the 'Croydon' period, Lawrence used what he called 'sermon paper' bearing the water-mark "Boots / Cash Stationers" (EWT 7, 11). This paper appears to have been unstitched folded quires of 12 leaves—some quires are still intact, in others the pages have been separated into individual leaves. In the case of The Trespasser , Lawrence placed a bold Roman numeral at the top left-hand corner of each new quire. Together with the numbering of the leaves of the original B sequence, these numerals establish the identity and integrity of B (see Table I). The leaves 'missing, believed lost' are 1-12, 25-34, 55, 311-12. Leaves 1-12 clearly belong to one complete quire, 13 bearing the numeral II at its head. Leaves 25-34 belonged to another quire, since 35 has the numeral IV at its head. This quire, presumably bearing the numeral III, must have contained only 10 pages instead of the expected 12, and this is odd. A glance at Table I will show the regularity of apparently complete 12-page quires throughout the manuscript. The apparent abberation of a 10-leaf quire II may—perhaps too neatly?—be compensated by a 14-leaf quire XI. The remainder of the 42 quires, except the last, regularly contain 12 leaves. Speculation in the interests of numerical harmony apart, I assume that the two quires now missing were present at the time of Powell's count in 1937. While it is easy to imagine an entire first quire being removed, mislaid, or inadvertently gathered into some bundle, it is more difficult to account for the first and the third quires being removed—unless III was already out of sequence. 15 The missing single leaf B55, representing the conclusion of Chapter III of the novel, may, as page 49 was, have been detached for incorporation into A, but was in the end re-written and then discarded. It was the ninth page in quire V, and the disappearance of a single detached leaf is more readily understandable in these circumstances than the disappearance of a whole quire. It is worth noting that the corresponding leaf now in A bears the double number 55 &amp; 56. In terms of the published novel, it is the concluding lines of Chapter III. The passage is close to Helen Corke's Diary and apparently can have been little altered in revision. 16 A similar case is found in the remaining two missing leaves 311-312. These appear early in what becomes Chapter XXI of the novel, the reaction of Siegmund and Helena to the incident with the launch. In A the passage has been considerably extended and recast: the two missing pages correspond to about four leaves in A. Although 311 and 312 fall between two isolated surviving leaves in B, their disappearance may not be unrelated to the fact that they were the last two leaves of quire XXIV. It may be noted that 313 is the final leaf in the present B collection. The second group of 'missing' leaves is hypothetical, since the sequential numbering of both A and B, including the missing leaves, is complete as the foregoing survey shows. This group of ten leaves existed at all only if Powell's count of 225 leaves in B is a true one. If it is accurate, I assume it consisted of 182 at present extant in B, plus the 25 presently missing and discussed above, plus the 8 leaves numbered 477-484 which Powell found missing from A—together a total of 215—and the additional 10 leaves, now being considered, for which there is no place in either sequence. It might be supposed that they were rough drafts or discarded leaves, but this is unfounded speculation. 17 What seems more likely, is that the figure 225 in Powell's catalogue "may have been simply an error". 18 An error of 10 in counting (or in printing) is highly probable. Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that the account just given of Powell's figure of 40 years ago is hypothetical and at this date incapable of empirical proof. What value it has is to emphasise the otherwise unusual regularity and consistency of the surviving evidence. Indeed the very neatness of the evidence and the case here presented may be an objection. It is in fact possible, even credible, that Lawrence worked in so neat and consistent a manner? Since the question of Lawrence's working methods was recently raised again by Charles L. Ross in his article on some revisions of The Rainbow , 19 consideration of the matter is in order here. Ross takes issue with those who present Lawrence as a 'daimonic' writer. Citing Aldous Huxley and F. R. Leavis, he argues that Lawrence's admirers have misrepresented his actual practice in composition. They would have us believe that "he did not, as most authors do, file, clip, insert, transpose; he rewrote"; that "he went forward rapidly once he had started an enterprise, writing long stretches in remarkably little time as the creative flow carried him on" (p. 277). Ross claims support from Mark Kinkead-Weekes for his view that "The actual practice of Lawrence, as the manuscript drafts reveal, was far more complex than either Huxley or Leavis imply. It was, in one critic's phrase, 'exploratory'—firm of purpose yet sensitive to the medium of fiction and willing to leave the work fluid and adaptable, both in its parts and as a whole, for a surprisingly long period of time" (p. 277). It is clear from the work of both Ross and Kinkead-Weekes that the textual history of The Rainbow is far more complex than that of The Trespasser . There is nothing in either case to match the three separate versions of Lady Chatterley which the other writers may have had principally in mind, and which is closer in time to Lawrence's own admission that he never revised or corrected, he only rewrote (see HL, xvii). The evidence, both external to the manuscripts and in the manuscripts themselves, suggests that Lawrence's practice in The Trespasser lies somewhere between that of 'exploratory revision' and 'daimonic' creative flow. That so much of the first version—with often considerable correction and revision—was taken over into the printer's copy argues against the 'daimonic' view. He clearly worked as the immediate circumstances of his review of existing work dictated. That the Saga was written mostly at night after arduous school-teaching by day, in the space of three months; that Miss Corke found little in it to criticise and nothing to condemn as she grew in awe of its writer; that in general the surviving pages show an even, steadily progressive hand and surprisingly little correction not consistent with that required by the revision for publication two years later; these together would seem to indicate a kind of obsessive, or at least intensely concentrated writing—'daimonic', if the term is preferred. Lawrence himself wrote during its composition: "I keep on writing, almost mechanically: very slowly and mechanically" (IOI 183); a point which has been commented on by Emile Delavenay: "He writes his novel 'almost mechanically', under the dictation of a 'second consciousness': as if hypnotized, he becomes the Doppelgänger of the first lover, who now haunts his thoughts; he is jealously aware that the shadow of Siegmund-Domine will always come between them" (ED 100). On the other hand, that only 189 pages were totally re-written in 1912 and the remaining 296 revised—where in fact they were to any significant degree—in a manner suggestive of the term 'exploratory' would argue for resourceful and conservative working. In other words, a little more than one third of the novel is totally re-written, large stretches are scarcely altered from the initial writing; but there are occasions—like the 'Stranger' episode in Chapter XIII—where both manuscripts show considerable 'exploration' as they are worked and reworked. Detailed support for this argument is not possible without a scrutiny of the contents of the manuscripts along the lines of Ross's discussion of The Rainbow . Perhaps it is sufficient to say that the 'neatness' of the evidence provided by the present review of the manuscripts is at best an indication of the economy of Lawrence's practice, at worst an illusion for which the complexity of the contents of the manuscripts is the reality. The problem of ten missing pages raised by Powell's figures can thus reasonably be ignored. The conclusion from both external testimony in letters and memoirs, and internally from the manuscripts, is that there were only ever two versions of the novel: 1. The Saga of Siegmund written in three months in the spring of 1910, submitted to Hueffer, provisionally accepted for publication by Pawling at Heinemann's and left in his office for 15 months; 2. The Trespasser , revised from The Saga with Garnett's encouragement during December-February 1911-12 and published by Duckworth in May 1912. The contention of the present work is that in the Bancroft manuscripts we can recover substantially both of these versions, in particular, all but 25 leaves of The Saga of Siegmund . The remaining consideration concerns the substantive differences between the published novel and the printer's copy. There are more than 260 of these, and the large majority are proof corrections of a routine kind; many are consistent with Lawrence's declaration of war on his adjectives (CL 107). A very few are more lengthy cancellations and insertions. Tedlock's conclusion that all "are attributable to revisions made by Lawrence in the proofs" (EWT 10), is probably sound; it does not however allow for last minute changes made either by Garnett or a Duckworth editor. Complete certainty cannot now be reached. 20 Miss Corke's suggestion "It is probable that the section dealing with 'Beatrice's' widowhood was inserted during the Bournemouth revision" (WT 237) may seem to call in question the conclusion just stated. If the version taken here to be the Saga , on the basis of the older pagination 1-503, contains no break in the sequence from Chapter XXIX to Chapter XXXI, then it may be that this version is not the original Saga as Miss Corke was it in 1910, or that her memory is at fault and the chapter was there all along or that she never in fact saw the complete manuscript. The second possibility seems more plausible since Miss Corke's account was written over 50 years after the event; and this would not be the only occasion on which her memory can be shown to be, understandably, at fault. It is difficult to rule out the third possibility, that she never saw the conclusion. This would account for her memory of the completion of the novel as earlier than in fact it was. In terms of the novel itself, the fact that the house at Highgate, Beatrice's guest-house, has already appeared in Chapter II, where Siegmund's violin lies in the attic, Beatrice already being a widow in the time-scheme, makes Chapter XXX a significant element in the symmetry of the work. It might be argued that Lawrence only became aware of a potential symmetry in retrospect at some period of revision (or composition) now unverifiable. This view could be related to Miss Corke's sense of a change in Lawrence's aesthetics late in their relationship (IOI 200, 214, 216). But such a change belongs rather to the known period of re-writing, which is verified by the manuscript evidence, rather than to a hypothetical revision antecedent to the existing manuscript. That Miss Corke was shown, or particularly noted, only those parts of the novel directly related to her own writing and experience is unlikely, and is contradicted by her account of the entirely fictitious 'stranger' episode. All that can be said is that Miss Corke's 'probability' is unsubstantiated. There is no break in pagination. A difficulty of another kind may be related to the missing quires I and III of the B collection. One consistent revision for the A-version is the alteration of the name Sieglinde to Helena. Even where Lawrence occasionally overlooked it in the A revision, it is everywhere changed in the printed text. There is, it is true, one allusion (T 24) to "Sieglinde's island". If not an oversight, this may have been retained by Lawrence as a permissible Wagnerism, even though Wagner's Sieglinde is nowhere associated with an island. In the surviving quires, II and IV of B, containing parts of Chapters I and II, the name is an unaltered 'Helena'. In Chapter XXXI, when the story returns to the novels 'present', the name is Sieglinde, but altered to Helena. Could this mean that the early parts of B are indeed a later version of the Saga ? There are several possible explanations. Lawrence may have begun with the name Helena (since the character is based on Helen Corke) and then, as he moved into the 'mind' of Siegmund (one of Helen Corke's names for H. B. Macartney), altered the name to the matching Wagnerian 'Sieglinde'. (There is no evidence that Lawrence himself referred to Helen Corke as Sieglinde, although there are letters to her from Jessie Chambers in which she, as 'Muriel', addresses Miss Corke as 'Dear Sieglinde'. It was one of Macartney's names for Helen Corke.) 21 This would be more convincing an explanation if, when the novel returns to the 'present', after Siegmund's death, the name returned to Helena. But this is not so in Chapter XXXI, although it is true that in Chapter XXIX, Olive and Louisa address her in direct speech as 'Helena', and in Chapter XXX, the narrator, taking Vera's part, calls her Helena. But all of these pages are B pages taken into A. Miss Corke has made a similar suggestion in a letter to the present writer of November 2, 1976. She says "The name Sieglinde probably appears . . . only when Siegmund is speaking, the author uses Helena." Stated thus, the view cannot be substantiated. However, it does suggest again, as the manuscripts themselves do, that Lawrence had originally in mind some separation of the Siegmund and Sieglinde experience, the centre of the novel, from the outer world of Helena and Cecil Byrne after Siegmund's death. In fact there is a passage in Chapter II, leaf B24, which suggests this. Siegmund has returned home from the opera-house, and is alone in his drawing-room. The text, having so far consistently used the name 'Helena' for the girl, continues "He could not free himself from a sense of ['Sieglinde' deleted ] Helena-Sieglinde—she haunted the room." From this point on, the name is 'Sieglinde' exclusively, except on the occasions in Chapters XXIX and XXX mentioned above. On page 47 of B, however, the 'Sieglinde' is twice written over a cancelled initial H. Is the 'Helena-Sieglinde' a deliberate change in the novel, directly related to the mind of Siegmund? Or perhaps an idea which emerges at this time in Lawrence's writing, not yet firmly established enough to prevent his beginning to write the original 'Helena'? A third possibility is that indeed the initial chapter(s) as we have them in B are already a re-writing of the opening of the Saga ; that is to say B, with those of its pages taken over into A, is already a composite one, with parts at least interim between lost originals and the final A-version. To hold this view we must also hold that the evidence of pagination, and of the quire-numeration, rests upon a neat coincidence. The only shred of counter-evidence could be in the fact of the missing quire II appearing to have had only 10 leaves. Nevertheless, related to this speculation is another curious point regarding names. In Chapter XXXI, the character named 'Cecil Byrne' in Chapter I of both A and B, appears as 'Ernest Lambert'. Throughout Chapter XXXI this is corrected to 'Cecil Byrne', though whether at the Saga stage or in the later revision is impossible to determine certainly. I am inclined to think it was the former. Miss Corke has no recollection of the name 'Lambert' in the version she saw. 22 This makes it less likely that 'Lambert' was ever used in Chapter I, and so that Chapter I as it stands in B is a revision. 'Ernest Lambert' however, is the name of a character (like Byrne, based on Lawrence himself) in the early play A Collier's Friday Night . The transference of the name of a self-portrait in an early unpublished work to a self-portrait in another is understandable, especially since we know that the Saga was completed when Lawrence was considerably fatigued. 23 We may note in passing the similarity of 'Cecil Byrne' to 'Cyril Beardsall', the self-portrait in The White Peacock which Lawrence was correcting with Miss Corke, and discussing with Heinemann at the time of the writing of the Saga . Lawrence frequently changed the names of characters, possibly having as much trouble with them as he did with the titles of his works. 24 In conclusion, though it may be prudent to maintain the possibility that manuscript B may wholly or in part be a "fair copy" of earlier material now lost, the weight of the evidence considered together here supports the integrity of the present B manuscript together with the renumberd pages in manuscript A as the first version of the novel. It can reasonably be taken to be The Saga of Siegmund .

The Soho Bibliographies, XII (1963), 351. 10 I think it almost certainly is not; the hand is similar to that in the notes discussed in this paper and therefore Garnett's. 11 E.g. The pagination at each new gathering of the printed text is indicated, and the manuscript is marked in stints for each of seven named type-setters. 12 The discrepancy between 207, and the 182 actual leaves can be accounted for, in the light of the argument presented in this paper, by consulting the table. After the transfer of 296 leaves from B to A there should indeed be 207 remaining from the original 503; but the 25 lost leaves (1-12; 25-34; 55; 311-312) reduce the total to 182. However the secondary numeration in B arrives at its end figure of 207 quite coincidentally as follows. The original numeration runs to 115, of which 23 leaves are lost, and three have gone to A—a loss of 26 reduces 115 to 89. To this we must add the unrevised leaf 129, thus making 90. Add to this the 92 leaves from secondary numbers 116-207 (recalling that 311-312 are lost and so not renumbered) and the 182 total of existing leaves is the result. 13 Confirmed in a letter from David Garnett to the author 28/6/77. Other notes in the same hand appear on the back of leaves A238, A260, A272, A365, B216 (165) and B228 (177). 14 Tedlock (EWT 7) significantly misreads the word as 'Bravios', which is meaningless. Presumably he checked with A272 and, of course, found nothing. The passage on B272 reads: "Her life of life she gave to Bromios, in mystic ritual. She had confused, for long enough, Siegmund with Bromios, her man with her God, as women will, until she had cried aloud to Bromios and Siegmund and failed to answer, when she repulsed him." Cf. Euripides The Bacchae , trans. Gilbert Murray (1904) pages 10-11, etc. I wish to thank Laurence Pollinger and the Estate of the late Frieda Lawrence for permission to quote from The Trespasser manuscripts. 15 However, we have already noted that leaves A477-84 were misplaced at the time of Powell's count in 1937. 16 A's page 55 &amp; 56 contains only the concluding half of what must have been B55. It is likely that Lawrence intended to use B55 in A by cancelling the material he had already re-written into A54 and finally decided it was preferable to complete a re-writing, and so he discarded B55. 17 Lawrence appears to have worked very economically. That he probably could not afford to waste paper may account for the state of some leaves, especially in the latter half of A, which went to the printer with numerous deletions and interlinear revisions. The leaf numbered 55 &amp; 56 in A contains the text on the verso of a discarded recto numbered 43. Lawrence had written 8 lines on this new page 43 in course of re-writing B43, but appears to have found it unsatisfactorily close to B. (The problem was the behaviour of Helena and Siegmund as they alight from the train at Freshwater.) He set aside this leaf and began again on the present leaf A43. The interim 43 was not discarded; its verso was used for A55. This, however, is the only surviving evidence of such economy. 18 This is suggested independently in a letter to me from the Head of the Manuscripts Division of The Bancroft Library (February 10th 1977). 19 "The Revisions of the Second Generation in The Rainbow ", RES , NS, XXVII, 107 (1976), 277-295. 20 The effect of house-style on the spelling and other accidentals of the printed text can be shown. On this and other points I am indebted to Elizabeth Mansfield, the editor of the forthcoming edition of The Trespasser for C.U.P. Her criticism of an earlier form of this paper was generous and constructive. 21 Since Siegmund was her name for Macartney and Sieglinde was his name for her, Lawrence may have first adopted Sieglinde as fitting for his 'Saga' and altered it as he became more objective towards the novel, and more involved himself with Helen Corke. See below. The letters of Jessie Chambers to Helen Corke are in the D. H. Lawrence Collection in the Library of the University of Nottingham, to whom I am indebted for permission to consult them. 22 Letter, Nov. 2, 1976. As stated earlier, it is possible that Miss Corke had never in fact seen the conclusion of the novel in manuscript. 23 It may simply have been that he had two possible names and had not finally chosen. 24 Siegmund and Helena's landlady on the Isle of Wight, named Mrs. Curtiss in T, was variously Mrs. Thorn, Mrs. Gunn and Mrs. Brinton during stages of composition. Siegmund's children, Vera, Frank and Marjorie in T are Maud, William and Millicent in manuscript—the latter is also Minna. Readers of T will notice a strange 'Irene' who appears once only, at the close of Chapter II, and an 'Elsa' has been deleted from the story in manuscript. Beatrice MacNair was formerly Mrs. Fitzpatrick in manuscript, and 'Alice', is twice deleted in favour of Beatrice. Miss Corke informs me that Alice was the actual name of Mrs. Macartney. A full discussion of this problem on names and its bearing on the composition of the novel is forthcoming.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Tracking Lawrence's Fox : an Account of its Composition, Evolution, and Publication by Judith G. Ruderman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since its first public appearance in 1922, D. H. Lawrence's novella The Fox has encountered contradictory reactions. F. R. Leavis praises the work for "the unambiguous clarity with which it presents its theme"; 1 but most critics seem to agree with the assessment of the anonymous reviewer in the Spectator , who, after recounting the plot of The Fox , admitted that "actually the story is very strange." 2 In fact, there is much disagreement about the author's intentions and the story's meaning, not to mention the impact of the "message" on the reader. 3 The differences of opinion about The Fox point up its ambiguities and suggest the need for further discussion, not only because The Fox is an important work in its own right, but also because it contains in miniature all the concerns and contradictions that mark Lawrence's third writing phase, which is characterized by the ideal of leadership. An accounting of the variations in The Fox from its genesis as a simple short story through its growth into a complex novella provides an accurate textual basis for critical assessment of the philosophical turn that Lawrence's art was taking in the formative stages of his leadership period. Lawrence wrote the first version of The Fox in Derbyshire in late autumn 1918, after having discussed his plans for the story with Katherine Mansfield in London during an October visit. On 21 November he noted cryptically, at the end of a long letter to this friend, "I've not done 'The Fox' yet." 4 Within three weeks he had finished "the fox story—rather odd and amusing" (CL, I, 568), and he sent Miss Mansfield the story to read and pass along to their agent, J. B. Pinker. This 1918 Fox , a twenty-two page unpublished draft, is now in the George Lazarus collection in England, but it was made available to the public in 1959 by Harry T. Moore in A D. H. Lawrence Miscellany . 5 The second version of The Fox was produced in Berkshire on 10 July 1919. Lawrence wrote to Pinker that "the letter about shortening the story, with the enclosure from Vivian Carter [journalist and editor of the Bystander , a popular magazine, from 1908-1916] came yesterday. Why it should be so many days behind I don't know. I would rather do the cutting myself"; a second letter, also dated 10 July, states, "I send The Fox by return. I wish I could have cut more—but I simply can't, without mutilating the story." 6 No manuscript or typescript of this second, revised version appears to be extant. The story appeared in Hutchinson's Story Magazine (Vol. iii., No. 17, pp. 477-490) for November 1920, 7 the same month that Lawrence wrote to Martin Secker from Sicily to "please get me a copy of Hutchinson's Story Magazine , published October 8th [Lawrence had gotten the date wrong: the notation October 8, 1920, on the proof sheets probably signifies the day on which he had made his corrections], and containing a story of mine 'The Fox.' I know nothing of this magazine. Please try and send me the copy." He received the magazine some time between 13 December 1920 and 14 January 1921; 8 yet only eleven months later he mistakenly informed his new British agent, Curtis Brown, that the story had been published in Nash's Magazine (CL, II, 680). Brian Finney discovered the Hutchinson's Fox and published word of its existence in a brief 1972 note; 9 he is the sole exception to the fact that Lawrence's "forgetfulness" and the unavailability of the correct journal have combined to send the second version of The Fox into oblivion so far as critics of the story are concerned. As a result of Hutchinson's being over-looked, misconceptions about Lawrence's intentions and achievement in the final, expanded version have flowered. 10 At first glance, the version of The Fox that appeared in Hutchinson's Story Magazine seems little different from the Lazarus manuscript. Brian Finney notes that "out of a story of some 9,000-9,500 words, Lawrence cut only about 650 words and altered the wording of a few more sentences." The first paragraph of the story exemplifies the obvious and least important kind of change that Lawrence made when cutting the piece for magazine publication: in Lazarus, March and Banford were going to rear chickens, make a living by poultry, and add to this by keeping a cow, and raising one or two young beast[s]. Unfortunately things did not turn out well" (L, p. 1); in Hutchinson's they simply "were going to rear chickens, keep a cow, and raise one or two young beasts" (H, p. 477). On at least six occasions, however, Hutchinson's has expanded Lazarus, and the significant additions have reference to the fox. For example, the fox in March's dream is "very yellow and bright, like corn or like fire" (H, p. 485), rather than just "very yellow and bright, like corn" (L, p. 16). Since the Hutchinson's version omits at least two references to Grenfel's fiery quality —"And again he burned"; "The great nerves in his thighs and at the base of his spine seemed to burn like live wire" (L, p. 19)—Lawrence probably inserted the succinct phrase "or like fire" in order to retain that important element in the story. Other, similar additions seem also to result from Lawrence's effort to restore to his work the power and significance of the fox that his deletions of whole sentences or even paragraphs from the first draft had tended to diminish. Minor word variants on the order of Banford's "quick" interest (H, p. 484) instead of her "perky" interest (L, p. 12) make no real contribution to the story's meaning or development. But other changes result in character growth for Ellen March and Henry Grenfel. The alterations concerning March create a stronger woman, one who still capitulates to Grenfel, but not quite so mindlessly. March's feeling about the marauding fox is expressed very differently in the first and second versions: in the Lazarus manuscript "She did not so much think of him: she was possessed by him" (L, p. 5); in Hutchinson's "She was possessed by a desire to defeat him—to outmatch him" (H, p. 478). Her resistance to the fox carries over into her relationship with Grenfel. In the proposal scene, the word lost rocks in March as if in "dark waves" (H, p. 488), not "a narcotic dream" (L, p. 20). At the close of the story, March's "wickedness," which had seemed to Banford only "secret" in the first version (L, p. 22), now seems "cunning" (H, p. 490); moreover, Lawrence omits the second-to-last paragraph, about March's living in a dream world of the fox. As March becomes stronger, so too does Grenfel, in the sense of being more hard-hearted and sure of himself. He makes a confident prediction to March—"Tomorrow we shall be all right!" (H, p. 490)—rather than a simple declaration: "Tomorrow we shall be married" (L, p. 22). And where the Lazarus manuscript has Grenfel suffering because he has to leave March for awhile, Hutchinson's says that "it is doubtful if he suffered in going." Lawrence revised The Fox again in November 1921, when he was living in Taormina, Sicily, and preparing to leave Europe in search of the ideal society he called Rananim. He had in his possession at that time the 1918 version of The Fox that he had requested and received from Pinker a month after severance of their business relationship in January 1920; 11 he also had the copy of Hutchinson's Story Magazine that Secker had sent him almost one year later. Between October 1921 and January 1922 Lawrence expanded his short stories "The Mortal Coil" and "The Thimble" (also requested from Pinker) into The Captain's Doll and The Ladybird , which he intended for publication with a new version of The Fox in a volume of novellas. On 16 November 1921 he wrote to a friend in Ceylon, who was importuning him to visit there, "I have put a long tail to 'The Fox,' which was a bobbed short story. Now he careers with a strange and fiery brush. I hope you will read him some time, because then you will see that I am not really drawn Buddhawards, but west" (CL, II, 678). This Taormina Fox , complete with "tail," is now owned by the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin. 12 The typescript returned by Pinker became the first thirty pages of the sixty-eight page Taormina manuscript; 13 by and large these typed pages correspond to the Lazarus manuscript. There is no knowing who made the typescript, but internal evidence suggests someone other than Lawrence. One of the typist's mistakes reveals the way in which people ancillary to the creative process can leave their marks on an author's work. In the first draft of The Fox , Lawrence writes the "when March saw the dark crests of the pine trees against the blond sky, again her heart beat to the fox, the fox" (L, p. 5). The Hutchinson's version, in accordance with the galley sheets, reads, "When she saw the dark crests of the pine-trees against the bland sky, her heart beat thick" (H, p. 479). The Taormina typescript page reproduces the Lazarus sentence in all respects except one: the pine trees now rise against the "blood" sky. Whoever transcribed these pages from the draft probably mistook the word blond for blood ; Lawrence's handwriting, normally quite legible, is not entirely clear on this point. In any case, the Taormina manuscript shows that Lawrence penned in the word red after blood , and all subsequent versions of The Fox have the pine trees rising against the blood-red sky. The image would more logically apply to a sunset, when March had first seen the fox that day, than to a moonlit night—which the word blond describes—when this scene takes place; "blood-red" is also opposite in connotation to the adjective bland , the Hutchinson's choice. Yet the image is symbolically effective in terms of the dichotomy between Grenfel's blood-consciousness and Banford's mental consciousness; the metaphor likening Grenfel to a tree ("And he sat . . . with all the blood burning in his veins, like fire in all the branches and twigs of him" T, p. 53, VP, p. 163); and the bloody death of Banford that occurs when a tree—Lawrence calls it a pine at first, but changes it to a scotch-fir (T, p. 57)—falls on her. Indeed, the image helps The Fox to career "with a strange and fiery brush." Lawrence made numerous handwritten changes in the typescript and then left off its final page, at the point where Grenfel has March and Banford under his spell. His interlinear markings in the typescript, combined with the substantial "tail" (thirty-eight holograph pages) that he added, change the story's direction by introducing such "western" elements as discord, violence, and murder. The little-known Hutchinson's Story Magazine version of The Fox may well have made a significant contribution to this change in direction. In the magazine story, as already noted, March shows a certain willfulness completely absent from Lawrence's first conception of her. A study of the prototypes for Lawrence's characters in The Fox 14 suggests that the Hutchinson's depiction of Ellen March matches her real-life counterpart more closely than the Lazarus version does. Violet Monk, a young woman at whose farm the Lawrences occasionally stayed between 1918 and 1919, has been described by her cousin (herself one of the models for Jill Banford) as "belligerent," with a personality that was "a strange mixture of overwhelming conceit and arrogance allied to a kind of meekness and unsureness in direct contradiction." 15 When Lawrence wrote the original (Lazarus) draft, in late autumn 1918, he had had little or no contact with Violet Monk for a seven-month period; but when he revised the story in summer 1919, producing the version that was published in Hutchinson's over a year later, he had been living near Monk and seeing her for over two months. Lawrence's close proximity to the farm-girl, providing him with frequent opportunities for observation, may well have prompted him to alter the personality of Ellen March in "The Fox"—most of these changes were made in July 1919 16 —even as the exigencies of getting his story published prevented his expanding on these alterations. When he revised the story again, in November 1921, Lawrence had not seen Monk for two years (though they had corresponded, and she had done some typing for him), but he had the Hutchinson's story before him and the freedom to elaborate on its suggestion of truculence in March's personality. Although Lawrence left untouched the Lazarus rendition of March's feelings of possession by the fox, he penned into the typescript a further note of resistance to Grenfel, the human fox: "Already the fright was in her voice. But she was too much mistress of herself" (T, p. 27, VP, p. 131). In the ensuing proposal scene, the Taormina typescript, following the Lazarus manuscript, reads, "But she knew she was lost" (L, p. 20); Lawrence crosses out "But she knew" and pens in "She felt for a minute" (T, p. 29, VP, p. 132). He also has the word lost rock in March "as if she were dying," to indicate the threat of annhilation that Grenfel poses to her. A comparison of this proposal scene among the three texts shows a gradual evolution from March's unthinking acquiescence to her qualified defiance: Lazarus, p. 21 "Say yes." "Yes—yes," she murmured slowly. . . . Hutchinson's , p. 489 "Say 'yes.'" "Yes. Oh, yes—if you like!" she murmured slowly. . . . Taormina, p. 29 "Say yes." "Oh I can't," she wailed helplessly. . . . [changes from Lazarus in DHL's hand] Indeed, a primary characteristic of the "tail" that Lawrence added to his story in 1921 is March's continued resistance to, and defiance of, Henry Grenfel. In one of the last paragraphs of the manuscript, in fact, Lawrence first has March "dying with the strain of her own hard wakefulness," and then, reconsidering the adjective, he crosses it out and writes resistant above it (T, p. 67). 17 Just as the Taormina version of The Fox follows the Hutchinson's lead in the growth of Ellen March, so too it continues the development of Henry Grenfel. In the Lazarus manuscript, Grenfel is a little lost boy; in the Hutchinson's version, he is more sure of himself; and in the Taormina manuscript, Lawrence takes pains to make Grenfel exceedingly foxy: he changes "clap" of laughter (L, p. 14) to "yap" of laughter (T, p. 19, VP, p. 124); Grenfel goes from being "rather confused" about his attraction to March (L, p. 17) to being "rather calm about it" (T, p. 23, VP, p. 128); Lawrence inserts a long section, using the hunting conceit, on how to go about winning the battle between the sexes (T, pp. 26-27, VP, pp. 130-131); he adds that Grenfel gathers himself "silently" together, then changes the adverb to "subtly" (T, p. 27, VP, p. 131); and, of course, the "accidental" death of Banford, added to the story in 1921, epitomizes Grenfel's cunning and acts as a climax to the new, expanded version of The Fox . One variant in particular evidences Grenfel's gradual evolution from lost boy to cunning fox: Lazarus, p. 19 And suddenly he wanted to stay here permanently, to have this place for his own. And then the thought entered him like a bullet: Why not marry March? . . . . His mind opened in amazement—then his soul gave an odd little laugh. Hutchinson's , p. 488 And suddenly he decided to stay here permanently, to have this place for his own. And then the thought entered him wickedly: Why not marry March? . . . . His mind opened in surprise—then his soul gave an odd little laugh. Taormina, p. 25 And he thought to himself, it would be a good thing to have this place for his own. And then the thought entered him shrewdly: Why not marry March? . . . . His mind waited in amazement—it seemed to calculate—and then he smiled curiously to himself, in acquiescence. [changes from Lazarus in DHL's hand] Another manifestation of Grenfel's cunning is found early on, when the women are trying to decide whether public opinion would permit a man to stay on with them. When they defiantly conclude that "we can look after ourselves," Grenfel first says, in the 1918 version, "Of course you can"; but, reconsidering, Lawrence crosses out the you in the Lazarus manuscript and changes it to we , which is how it appears in the Hutchinson's copy (L, p. 15, H, p. 485). The choice of pronoun makes a difference: with we , Grenfel has already assimmilated himself, somewhat ingenuously, into the household and its affairs; with you , Grenfel ingeniously reinforces the women's decision by leaving himself out of the affair—as he will do in the "accident" with Banford. When Lawrence revised again in 1921, he underscored Grenfel's cunning by crossing out the we in the typed sentence and penning in an interlinear you (T, p. 21, VP, p. 126), thereby returning to his very first conception. A little later on, Lawrence changes Grenfel's plea to stay on the farm into a statement of why he cannot possibly stay elsewhere, and once again Lawrence has him ostensibly leaving himself out of the decision: "He put the matter to them" (L, p. 17, H, p. 486) becomes "He left the matter to them" (T, p. 23, VP, p. 128). The changes in the characterization of Grenfel that underplay his need for security and emphasize his cunning "foxiness" were made between October 1920, when Lawrence corrected the Hutchinson's proofs, 16 and November 1921, when he expanded his story. Until late 1919 Lawrence was especially dependent on the women around him for shelter and sustenance: after his expulsion from Cornwall in autumn 1917, under suspicion as a German spy, Lawrence relied for housing on many people, among them his sister Ada, who leased a cottage for him in Derbyshire at her expense, and Margaret Radford, who lent or rented to him—and then reappropriated or visited at whim—her cottage in Berkshire. Moreover, he was deathly ill with influenza from late 1918 until spring 1919 and desperately needed Frieda's nursing. Exacerbating Lawrence's immediate needs for security was the lifelong dependency on outside support that he had developed in his protracted, often sickly childhood with the domineering Lydia Beardsall Lawrence. Lawrence's need for mothering seems to have been the common denominator of many business or literary relationships as well. Of Lawrence in his Croydon years, during which time Mrs. Lawrence died, Ford Madox Ford writes, "I cannot say that I liked Lawrence much. . . . He had so much need of moral support to take the place of his mother's influence that he kept one in a constant state of solicitude. He claimed moral support imperiously—and physical care too." 18 But in November 1919 Lawrence took off for Sicily, leaving England behind and with it, he thought, his past. Shortly afterward he decided to take business matters in his own hands: in January 1920 he broke with J. B. Pinker and Pinker's "grinning patronage" (CL, I, 544). Lawrence explained the break to his American publisher Ben Huebsch: "I want to act now for myself. And I must be clear and sure about everything. I don't like this vague, half-friendly, in-the-air sort of business. It leaves me irritated and dependent" (CL, I, 613). Yet Lawrence was still dependent on publishers, and he soon complained to Huebsch that Huebsch left him "in the same vague and airy cast as all the rest: very friendly, but never telling me anything " (CL, I, 618). Recognizing Lawrence's extreme touchiness on the subject, a friend advised a publisher's agent that "if you don't want to lose Lawrence's friendship, you must be very careful never to let him guess that you are doing anything for him." 19 When Lawrence corrected the Hutchinson's galleys in October 1920, and expanded The Fox in November 1921, he may have played down Henry Grenfel's need for security because he felt more confident in his ability to do for himself, in both the domestic and the literary realms. Or perhaps he wished to cover up some nagging doubts about himself, especially after cutting his ties to home and the security it represented. Henry Grenfel may have become more like a fox because his creator felt increasingly like a wild and reckless creature, flouting society and fending for himself. In subtle counterpoint to Grenfel's increasing foxiness is a new element of qualification regarding his capture of Ellen March: Lawrence's creation of a more assertive March as well as a more determined Grenfel results in a stand-off battle between the two. Grenfel had gone from seeming only "cocky" in the first version of the story (L, p. 22) to seeming "triumphant" in the second (H, p. 490). But Lawrence rejected this direction for his novella, deleting the many references to Grenfel's success with March and inserting other, more tentative sentiments in their stead. Thus, where Grenfel had felt "a curious elate triumph" when he looked into March's eyes (L, p. 19, H, p. 488), he feels only "a curious elate excitement" in the Taormina manuscript (T, p. 25, VP, p. 129). The proposal scene is altered accordingly: Lazarus, pp. 20-21 "I want you—you see—that's why—" he proceeded, soft and slow. He had achieved his work. . . . She was in his power. He stepped forward and put his arm round her. [ Hutchinson's version essentially the same] Taormina, p. 29 "I want to marry you, you see. Why shouldn't I?" he proceeded, soft and rapid. He waited for her to answer. In the dusk he saw her almost phosphorescent. . . . She seemed to be in his power. But he waited, watchful. He dared not yet touch her. [changes from Lazarus in DHL's hand] It is just after the proposal scene, which comes near the end of the Lazarus and Hutchinson's versions, when Lawrence apparently discarded the one remaining page of typescript and continued the story in his own hand: he must have decided that it was foolish for him to do any more extensive revision, since the original ending—in which the women are completely dominated by Grenfel—was now totally inappropriate and required complete replacement. Unlike the characters of Grenfel and March, which show development between the Lazarus and Hutchinson's versions of The Fox , the character of Jill Banford changes significantly only in the expanded version of the story. In a sense Banford is the expanded version, for the "tail" is concerned with her influence on March and with Grenfel's attempts to fight that influence. Banford's role in the novella is as ambiguous as it is prominent, for Lawrence was very careful to make her a rather sympathetic figure even as Grenfel perceived her to be a threat to his existence. In the Lazarus manuscript, Lawrence mentions Banford's "natural warmth and kindliness" and her "sisterly attention" to Grenfel (L, p. 15). In the Taormina typescript, after the notation that Ellen March was attending to the fowls, Lawrence adds in his own hand that "then she flew into the village on her bicycle to try and buy food. She was a hospitable soul"; but he crosses out "then she" and inserts the word Banford —it is Banford, not March, who is to be the "hospitable soul" (T, p. 23). Again, when the women decide to let Grenfel stay on for awhile, Lawrence inserts the following exchange between Banford and Grenfel: "It's no bother, if you like to stay. It's like having my own brother here for a few days. He's a boy like you are." "That's awfully kind of you," the lad repeated. "I should like to stay, ever so much, if you're sure I'm not a trouble to you." "No, of course you're no trouble. I tell you, it's a pleasure to have somebody in the house besides ourselves," said warm-hearted Banford. . . . "Well then," he said, "I should love it, if you'd let me pay my board and help with the work." "You've no need to talk about board," said Banford (T, pp. 24-25, VP, p. 129). On the one hand, Banford's very hospitality is a source of danger to Grenfel, who, like Lawrence, resents "patronage" of any sort; 20 her arranged death is Grenfel's ultimate means of revenge and the mechanism by which he hopes to take control of his life. On the other hand, Lawrence is setting the stage for a betrayal: Banford has graciously opened her home to a stranger, who will then proceed to try to steal from her her most prized possession—a fictional turn of events reminiscent of Lawrence's "theft" of Frieda Weekley from his hospitable French professor. Banford's death, viewed in this light, is the last word in ingratitude. Lawrence's emphasis on Banford's warmth and kindliness does not gainsay her clearly negative qualities—her snobbery, ultra-refinement, and extreme spirituality—but it does cast doubt on complaints that Lawrence has tried unsuccessfully to weld an evil Banford onto an earlier conception of her character as benign; it casts doubt as well on arguments that Banford's death is a "deed of life," or a moment of self-realization for Grenfel. 21 The murder of Banford has drawn praise because Lawrence would have it represent the necessary passing away of an entire mode of living. In 1921 Lawrence had grand designs for his story: in the 1918-1919 versions, Bailey Farm is a setting for the action; in the final version, Bailey Farm is a microcosm of England. Grenfel, hunting the fox, feels trapped by all the farmhouses representing England "little and tight" (T, p. 40, VP, p. 146). Bailey Farm epitomizes English sterility, and Jill Banford, owner of the farm, personifies that quality. To reinforce the point that the women's lack of success at breeding their animals indicates their negative attitude toward life, Lawrence penned into the Taormina typescript Banford's remarks about not having a good opinion "of Nature altogether. . . . Don't talk to me about nature," and he added goats and the weather to the list of natural phenomena that Banford says she and March abhor (T, p. 19, VP, p. 124). Even Lawrence's slips of the pen in the holograph portion of the manuscript may reveal the author's desire to highlight the barren existence at Bailey Farm. On numerous occasions, for example, he wrote Marsh instead of March (T, pp. 31-35, 46, 50), sometimes catching his mistake and correcting the s to a c . Perhaps Lawrence had Edward "Eddie" Marsh on his mind, since that name is similar to Ellen "Nellie" March. 22 The first such error occurs in a description of Banford's refined sitting room, which may have put Lawrence in mind of Marsh's own home. Lawrence owed a great deal to Edward Marsh, who had lent him sums of money and published his work in Georgian Poetry ; but Lawrence considered Marsh's kindness to him to be patronizing, and much Georgian poetry to be effete, and these are the associations with Bailey Farm that may have led to Lawrence's mistakes. In fact, the very name of the farm gave Lawrence trouble: once he called it Beedle Farm (T, p. 33), another time, Beeley Farm (T, p. 39). Combined into a portmanteau word, Beedle , Beeley , and Bailey almost spell Breadalby , which is Hermione Roddice's country home in Women in Love . The coincidence suggests that Lawrence had it at least in his unconscious mind to model Bailey Farm, in certain key respects, on Hermione's false paradise. Interestingly, the real-life model for Bailey Farm had a name that in and of itself hints at joylessness and death: Grimsbury. The Taormina version of The Fox , then, shows Lawrence undertaking a more ambitious examination of love and of life than he had first attempted in 1918. If the ending is tentative, and its effect both confusing and unsettling to the reader, it may be because Lawrence, like Grenfel, was in the transitional state of rejecting Europe and reaching out for a better way of life in some "foreign" place. Grenfel's failure to become lord and master, even after drastic efforts, may reflect one or more aspects of his creator's life: Lawrence's admission of his own needs and weaknesses; his acknowledgment of the power and strength of the women around him; his belief in the necessity for conflict in the love relationship; his emphasis on maintaining one's individuality and uniqueness. The final pages of the Taormina manuscript show an increasing number of minor deletions and alterations, as if Lawrence were finding it harder and harder to express himself precisely. Grenfel's final remark—" 'If only we could go soon,' he said with pain in his voice"—comes at the bottom of a page and Lawrence chooses not to begin a new one: he too is impatient to get on with it . . . to go west, as he said to his friend in Ceylon. However, the importunate letters from Mabel Dodge Sterne temporarily frightened Lawrence off his westward course; taking off "Buddhawards," for Ceylon, he sent in his place—through his American agent, Robert Mountsier—the new, expanded version of The Fox . The story was accepted by the Dial magazine in New York for the sum of five hundred dollars. 23 It was this magazine's publication of Sea and Sardinia that had convinced Mabel Sterne that Lawrence must come to America to do for New Mexico what he had done for Sardinia, and that had initiated her flurry of letters to him. Lawrence may well have had his eye on the Dial when he revised The Fox in 1921, for the magazine had already printed his work in seven out of its fifteen previous issues. The Dial had begun its publishing of Lawrence in September 1920, with a seemingly innocuous story about Adolph the pet rabbit that Middleton Murry of the London Athanaeum had nonetheless rejected because of its scatalogical references to Lawrence's own relations with England. Lawrence knew that the avant-garde American journal would not reject his novella out of hand because of its condemnation of English "littleness" or its violent destruction of the character who embodied that quality. The differences between the two magazines that published The Fox correspond to the differences between the two versions of the story, one a romantic fantasy, the other an exploration of man's relationships to woman and society. Hutchinson's Story Magazine was a glossily-illustrated mass-circulation monthly. It provided captioned drawings to accompany Lawrence's text; interposed between pages of "The Fox" slick photographs of the leading stage beauties of the day ("A pleasing picture of. . . ," "A charming picture of. . . ," "A clever portrait of. . . ."); followed the story with a sentimental poem, by one P. M. Doherty, entitled "Alone"; and subtitled Lawrence's work, "A fine story of a post-war partnership between two modern young women—and the intervention of the inevitable man." The Dial , in contrast, was a "little magazine" of international scope (for example, it published T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land in November 1922), not inhospitable to lengthy works. It printed Lawrence's story uninterrupted and unembellished by illustrations, and, in general, it favored art work of the line-drawing variety—Picasso's, for example—or reproductions of "primitive" artifacts like the Mayan god Chac-Mool and watercolors by young Indians of Taos (Joost, pp. 67-68). The Fox ran serially in the Dial from May through August 1922, with many variations from the Taormina typescript. Nicholas Joost and Alvin Sullivan, in their book on Lawrence's association with this journal, offer no explanation for the Dial variants, and neither they nor the curator of the Yale University Library, where the Dial papers are housed, have any further information on the Fox-Dial relationship. But Joost and Sullivan's accounts of the care that the Dial editors exercized with other Lawrence materials over the nine-year period that Lawrence was associated with their journal suggest that the changes were either made or sanctioned by the author himself (Joost, pp. 40, 47, 104-105). Lawrence had had a typescript of the Taormina manuscript made for him by a Mrs. Carmichael in Florence, and he sent this typescript off to Mountsier in America in December 1921 (Tedlock, p. 94), where it made its way to the Dial . In January 1922 he left Europe and traveled to Ceylon, Australia, and points in between during the three months preceding the Dial serialization. Whether Lawrence made alterations on either the typescript or (less likely) the galleys is unknown at this time, for neither document appears to be extant. Certain of the Dial variations, carried over into all subsequent publications of the story, clearly bear the stamp of Lawrence's approval. In the Dial , unlike the three earlier versions, March and Banford are "near thirty" (D, p. 471, VP, p. 113) rather than "over thirty" (L, p. 1, H, p. 477, T, p. 1), perhaps in an attempt to heighten the credibility of a love affair between March and twenty-year-old Grenfel. That Lawrence intended this change is shown by an interlinear correction in the "tail" of the Taormina manuscript, where Lawrence started to say that Banford was not "much over" thirty, then, reconsidering, he crossed out "much over" and penned in "yet" (T, p. 33, VP, p. 137). In the Lazarus and Taormina manuscripts, "Banford wished to paint curvilinear swans on porcelain. . . . For she was a creature of odd whims and unsatisfied tendencies" (L, pp. 2-3, T, p. 4). In the Dial , Banford's name is replaced by March's, as Lawrence meant it to be, for, further on in the Taormina manuscript, he mentions that the sitting room contains March's handpainted swans (T, p. 31, VP, p. 135). It is, after all, March and not Banford whose "unsatisfied tendencies" are at the heart of the story. Other Dial variants are problematic. In light of the added stress on Grenfel's cunning in the 1921 version of the story, it seems entirely appropriate that Grenfel's eyes, which were only "wide" and childish in the Taormina manuscript, following Lazarus and Hutchinson's (L, p. 16, H, p. 485, T, p. 23), are "wise" and childish in the Dial (D, p. 485, VP, p. 127); however, this change may perhaps be one of those inevitable accidents of publishing. Another variation occurs when Banford reacts to Grenfel's news about the impending marriage between him and March: in the Taormina manuscript she says, "I should die with shame" (T, p. 37), but in the Dial she exclaims, "It's absolutely impossible!!" (D, p. 577, VP, p. 142). Since Banford again says "absolutely impossible" at the dénouement of the story—when Grenfel, pretending to be solicitous, warns her that the tree may fall on her (VP, p. 173)—one may surmise that Lawrence intended the deliberate echo to link the two scenes symbolically and thematically. Three variants occur in the scene where March has put on a dress for the first time, thereby awakening Grenfel's sense of male responsibility toward her. Perhaps in accordance with the Dial 's determined efforts to publish "the modern," March wears a "modernly" short skirt (D, p. 79, VP, p. 156) instead of a "moderately" short one (T, p. 48). More important, Banford acts graciously toward Grenfel, who is leaving the next morning, only because she feels "she must be as nice as she could" (D, p. 80, VP, p. 157), not because "she would miss him when he had gone" (T, p. 49). Certainly it would be unreasonable for her to miss the person who has disrupted her household and threatened her authority. Concomitant with Banford's more superficial politeness toward Grenfel is his more profound desire to get rid of her: "He wanted her to go to bed" (D, p. 80, VP, p. 157) rather than "He waited for her to go to bed" (T, p. 49). Grenfel's hatred of Banford occasions further variations. In the Dial , after Grenfel receives March's "Dear Henry" letter he is possessed by one "thing" (i.e., Banford), whereas in the manuscript there had been one "thorn" (T, p. 56, D, p. 186, VP, p. 167). Since the word thorn is used several other times in this paragraph, Lawrence or the Dial editors may simply have decided that there was one thorn too many here. In any case, another change—one that eliminates the same word, and with it, Lawrence's characteristic mode of repetition—occurs after the death of Banford: Taormina, p. 63 He knew it, and he was satisfied. Satisfied in his soul and his blood. The thorn was drawn out of his life, he could live again. The thorn was drown out of his bowels. Dial , p. 193 (VP, p. 174) He knew it, that it was so. He knew it in his soul and his blood. The inner necessity of his life was fulfilling itself, it was he who was to live. The thorn was drawn out of his bowels. 24 A month after the final installment was published in the Dial , Lawrence arrived in North America for what was to be a three-year stay, about half of it in the Taos region of New Mexico. From Taos he negotiated with Martin Secker in London and Thomas Seltzer in New York for publication of his three novellas, The Captain's Doll , The Fox , and The Ladybird , about which he had written Seltzer in January 1922, "[they] will, I think, make a really interesting book—perhaps even a real seller." 25 Seltzer and his wife visited the Lawrences in New Mexico from Christmas day 1922 until 2 January 1923, and on their last day together Lawrence signed a contract for a volume to be called The Captain's Doll . Two weeks later he wrote to Seltzer that, according to Curtis Brown, "Secker is making a fine book of Ladybird , and will bring it out in March. I knew that was what they were up to. Hurry up your printers. If you have proofs of Captain's Doll &amp; Fox, &amp; there is time, let me see proofs. I will send them back at once. But be sure &amp; be ready with the book early in March. That Secker shall not steal a march on us [a fitting, if unintended pun on the plot of The Fox ], and leave us stranded in April" (Lacy, p. 56. It should be noted that Lawrence wrote in similar angry terms to Secker about Seltzer). In early 1923 there occurred a bit of frantic maneuvering with Hearst International, which had paid Lawrence one thousand dollars in September 1922 for magazine rights to The Captain's Doll but had not yet published the story; this delay was holding up publication of the hardcover volumes in both England and America. In February Lawrence returned the Ladybird proofs to Seltzer, and, as Hearst had released rights to The Captain's Doll , he also informed Seltzer and Secker to fix a simultaneous date of publication. Preparing to leave for Mexico, Lawrence instructed Seltzer to "let me have proofs of everything as soon as they come off the press, no matter where I am" (Lacy, p. 73); "Remember to send me proofs of everything" (p. 74). Correspondence with Secker about proofs for the English edition is notably lacking from Secker's collection of Lawrence's letters to him, which includes no letters between 19 September 1922 and 20 February 1923. We do know that Lawrence never saw the Seltzer galleys of The Fox ; for in May 1923 he sent Seltzer a list of corrections from the Captain's Doll volume made by a concerned reader in the Brooklyn Library (Lacy, p. 93) to whom Lawrence had responded, "In excuse, I've had no proofs of the books printed in America except the story 'Ladybird'" (CL, II, 742). Martin Secker published The Ladybird in London in March 1923 and Thomas Seltzer came out with The Captain's Doll: Three Novelettes in New York the following month—"stranded in April," as Lawrence had feared. 26 In both volumes The Fox was the second story, though the order of the other two stories was reversed. The fact that approximately thirty Dial variants—almost all of the total number—carry over into both texts of The Fox suggests that the Dial was the printer's copy for the Secker and Seltzer editions. There are numerous minor differences between the Seltzer and Secker texts of The Fox , and these differences, combined with the accidents of publishing, account for the variations among the editions in print today. 27 Viking Press, for instance, publishes two slightly different versions of the novella: The Portable D. H. Lawrence , first issued in 1947 and edited by Diana Trilling, follows the faulty Seltzer text (and is the only British or American edition to do so); Four Short Novels , first issued in 1965, follows the also faulty and probably equally unauthoritative Secker text. In the burgeoning of critical attention to the Lawrence canon, since the 1950s, The Fox has generally been regarded as a work apart from Lawrence's leadership fiction, concerned with personal relationships rather than with large social and political issues. Yet in The Fox as Lawrence expanded it in 1921, Jill Banford, by virtue of her attempts to expel Grenfel from her domestic domain, exemplifies the England that hounds its foxes—those, like Lawrence, with anti-social tendencies. Moreover, Jill Banford is but one of the many Lawrencian figures who, because of their domineering motherliness, are seen as the enemy, and who come to represent for Lawrence in his leadership period a certain stand on a whole spectrum of social, educational, and political issues. Banford metamorphoses in a later work into the woman who rode away, the epitome of White Consciousness, who becomes, in her turn, Don Ramón's first wife in The Plumed Serpent . All of these women must die for the good of society. The ambiguities in The Fox regarding the death of Banford, the leadership of Grenfel, and the capitulation of March reflect the conflict between Lawrence's lifelong belief in the necessity for maintaining one's integrity in any relationship and his injunction—developed and promulgated especially during the years between 1917 and 1925—toward the power role of certain strong men. The evolution of The Fox poignantly mirrors Lawrence's own attempts at cutting the bonds to motherhood, home, and society, setting himself free to take charge of his life and to build a better world. That Lawrence himself regarded these attempts as tentative, even unsuccessful, is revealed in a letter he wrote to Murry from Mexico in 1923, when he had begun work on what was to become the crowning achievement of his leadership period, The Plumed Serpent : "I think in the long run perhaps 'The Ladybird' has more the quick of a new thing than the other two stories. 'The Fox' belongs more to the old world" (CL, II, 743). 28</field>

Mellown of Duke University suggests to me that Lawrence may have had in mind the Brangwen farm, the Marsh, in The Rainbow . 23 Nicholas Joost and Alvin Sullin Sullivan, D. H. Lawrence and the Dial (1970), p. 62. Further references in the text to Lawrence's relationship with the Dial are to this volume. 24 Other variations, all of them minor, seem to have been made or suggested by the Dial editors in an effort toward conciseness, or to bring Lawrence's prose in line with standard—or simply American—usage. Certain of the Dial variants are unfortunate. In the authorial commentary at the end of the story, Lawrence generalizes about March's experiences and uses the present tense in order to apply his remarks to all readers: "The more you reach after the fatal flower of happiness. . . ." (T, p. 66); the Dial (p. 196), followed by the Secker, Seltzer, Viking Portable and Heinemann Phoenix editions, substitutes the past tense reached (the word appears as reach in Viking Compass, Viking Penguin [p. 177], Bantam and Dent Everyman's: either the error was corrected by an astute editorial assistant or the word was changed accidentally when new editions were re-set). Lawrence had first written reached in the manuscript, but he struck out the last two letters and continued the paragraph in the present tense. For another example, Grenfel's face, which had been "queer, chubbed, ruddy" in the manuscript (T, p. 54), becomes "queer, chubby, ruddy" in the Dial (p. 87) and all subsequent versions (VP, p. 164)—a change that lacks consistency as well as euphony, since Grenfel's face was already described as "chubbed" on page 80 of the Dial (VP, p. 158). Another variant lacking consistency concerns the word nonchalant : Lawrence in the Taormina manuscript seems fond of the construction "she said [or replied, or cried], nonchalant" following direct address, but on two occasions he inadvertently left out the comma before the adjective (T, pp. 44, 48). The Dial changes one of these expressions—"she said nonchalant"—to "she said nonchalantly" (D, p. 586, VP, p. 151), while simply retaining Lawrence's mistake in the second instance: "she cried nonchalant" (D, p. 78, VP, p. 156). All editions follow the Dial in the first change, but only the Seltzer and Viking Portable repeat the second error. Finally, in the Dial and all subsequent texts, the last sentence—"He watched her"—is omitted from this paragraph: "'I hope it is,' said Banford, feeling nettled by him. He had a strange, suave assurance and a wide-eyed bright look that got on her nerves this evening. He watched her" (T, p. 30, D, p. 569, VP, p. 134). Mrs. Carmichael may have inadvertently left off the words when she made her typescript, for this very small sentence is the final one on a holograph page, placed all the way over by the left-hand margin and written in Lawrence's characteristically restrained hand. 25 D. H. Lawrence, Letters to Thomas and Adele Seltzer , ed. Gerald M. Lacy (1976), p. 30. Further references in the text to Lawrence's relationship with Seltzer are to this volume. 26 F. Warren Roberts, in A Bibliography of D. H. Lawrence (1963), p. 61, incorrectly lists the date of the first American edition as 14 November 1923. 27 The Seltzer text (not proofread by Lawrence) contains numerous variants with no precedent in either the Taormina manuscript or the Dial publication: for example, Banford's father says "Ha!" twice when speaking to Grenfel (Sltzr, p. 212, VPort, p. 294), whereas in all other versions he says "Hm!" (VP, p. 171). The Seltzer text changes March's "small, patent shoes" (VP, p. 156) to the expression familiar to American readers: "small, patentleather shoes" (Sltzr, p. 191, VPort, p. 276). It also has a line of ducks "cackling their way top speed downwards towards the fence . . . and cackling as excitedly as if they brought news of the Spanish Armada" (Sltzr, p. 214), although Lawrence had written (and all other versions reproduce) "cockling their way top speed," which is British dialect for wobbling (VP, p. 172). Another Seltzer deviation from previous texts can be found in the Viking Compass, Viking Penguin, and Bantam paperbacks as well as in the Viking Portable: March feels a spark fall from Grenfel's eyes "as had fallen from the dark eyes of the fox" (VP, p. 128). Secker, followed by Heinemann Phoenix and Dent Everyman, reproduces the manuscript and Dial versions with "as it had fallen. . . ." (T, p. 23, D, p. 486, Sckr, p. 102), which is the clearer construction. The Secker text itself contains unprecedented variants. In one case, a double negative—"You haven't a very high opinion of fowls and cattle, haven't you?" he said" (Sckr, p. 97)—finds its way into the Heinemann Phoenix but not into the Compass edition that used the Phoenix for a model. Other variants appear in every succeeding edition except for the Seltzer and Viking Portable (which contain the Taormina and/or Dial variants). For example, toward the end of the story the ambiguous she in "And if she had married a man" is changed to the proper noun Jill (Sckr. p. 156, VP, p. 177). Another variation occurs when Grenfel explains to the women why he will have to stay on with them at Bailey Farm: Taormina, p. 23 "At the Swan they've got this Flu, and at the Plough and Harrow they've got the soldiers who are collecting the hay for the army: besides in the private houses. There's ten men and a corporal altogether billeted in the village, they tell me." Dial , pp. 485-86 "At the Swan they've got this Flu, and at the Plough and Harrow they've got the soldiers who are collecting the hay for the army: besides in the private houses, there's ten men and a corporal altogether billeted in the village, they tell me." Secker, p. 101 "At the Swan they've got this flu, and at the Plough and Harrow they've got the soldiers who are collecting the hay for the army: besides, in the private houses, there's ten men and a corporal altogether billeted in the village, they tell me." Seltzer (and Viking Portable) follows the Dial here, in what I consider to be an inferior variation: all questions of meaning aside, this version seems too polished to have come out of Grenfel's mouth. The Secker variation, found in all other editions as well (VP, pp. 127-28), contains a different sense—"moreover" for the word besides , and therefore is also suspect. The original version in the Taormina manuscript has the merits of being not only perfectly understandable to the reader but also entirely appropriate to the speaker. The Heinemann Phoenix edition contains a variant, followed in Viking Compass, Viking Penguin, and Bantam, that is an obvious error: this text has March and Banford washing up the "tea-cups" in the kitchen (HP, p. 9, VP, p. 119), although in every other version, beginning with the Lazarus manuscript, they are washing up the "tea-things." 28 For aid in the preparation of this paper I wish to thank Elgin W.

      <field name="heading_text">A Textual History of Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory by David Leon Higdon *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the years since its publication in early 1940, Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory has established itself as one of the most important modern novels. 1 The novel has also established a special place for itself among Greene's other works, having given him "more satisfaction that any other [he] had written." 2 Yet few of its critics and fewer of its readers know that the novel exists in print in four states of text distinguished by almost four hundred substantive variants. 3 For example, American readers have for years viewed a drunken priest baptizing a boy "Carlota" (A37), while English readers have seen the same boy baptized "Brigitta" (E30), an unconscious reminder of the priest's concern over and love for his illegitimate daughter, memory of whom intrudes into his drunken state. 4 Those who teach the novel know the intent, almost obsessive, interest students have in Coral Fellows and their attempts to explain what happens to her—Murder? Worms? Appendicitis? A miscarriage? The American text tells us that she stands "in pain" (A73); the English text more explicitly reads "in her woman's pain" (E65). The striking figure of the small snake rearing "itself like an affronted woman on the path" (E103) disappears from the later editions (U104), as does the description of Luis's two sisters "enjoying themselves like Hell" (E60/U61) as they listen to their mother read the pious history of Juan's martyrdom. Also, one of the most memorable defining metaphors in the novel—"He gave up the effort: this place [the jail cell] was very like the world elsewhere: people snatched at causes of pleasure and pride in cramped and disagreeable surroundings: there was no time to do anything worth doing, and always one dreamed of escape . . ." (E165/C158)—is missing from the most recent edition of the novel. Those readers who silently congratulate Greene for resisting Church pressure to revise his novel ( C , xi) and who assume that his refusal "to revise the book, on the casuistical ground that the copyright was in the hands of [his] publisher" indicates stability in the text are as mistaken as those who assume that his admitted satisfaction with part of the novel indicates no later revisions occurred. 5 Three-hundred-eighty-five substantive and almost two thousand accidental variants scarcely make a stable text, especially when many of the variants involve readings crucial to an interpretation of the whisky priest. In A Sort of Life , his autobiography, Greene turned to a Jamesian metaphor in commenting generally on his revisions: There are faults in his [an author's] work which he alone detects; even his unfavourable critics miss them, dwelling on obvious points which can be repaired, but like a skilled intuitive builder he can sniff out the dry rot in the beams. How seldom has he the courage to dismantle the whole house and start again ( SL , 156). The Name of Action (1930) and Rumour at Nightfall (1931) have been "demolished" through suppression. The Heart of the Matter (1948) and The End of the Affair (1951) have undergone extensive "remodeling"; and most of the other novels have experienced repairs, more or less extensive. 6 The Power and the Glory belongs in the latter group and provides an opportunity to view Greene the stylist concentrating on the art of the exact detail, the carefully planned effect, and the minimal text. It also shows Greene moving through at least three stages or attitudes towards his texts. Neither William Heinemann nor Viking Press, the publishers of the first English and American editions, anticipated that the novel would be a success, much less a classic. Heinemann issued a small 3500-copy edition, and Viking only 2000 copies ( C , x). Since no correspondence is yet available and because publishers' records from the period were destroyed during World War II or as a matter of policy, 7 the relationship between the two editions must be inferred from collational evidence. Fortunately, a set of unmarked Heinemann proofs exists, 8 and from it one can conclude that the American edition was set from either a duplicate typescript or galley proofs heavily "americanized" by Viking editors whereas the English edition evolved from proofs corrected and revised by Greene. The unmarked proofs, for instance, contain two errors—"customs" (P4/A10) for "customs'" (E4) and "C men" (P24/A31) for "G men" (E24)—repeated in the American edition, and an error—"excusada" (P21)—"corrected" in the American to "excusado" (A27) but "excusados" (E21) in the English. Furthermore, the priest comes closer to revealing his name in the American edition than he does in the English text. The text reads: "he gave his name to a stranger for the first time in ten years: Father So-and-so" (A213). This move towards individualization does not appear in the English text (E198), though it does appear in the unmarked proofs (P198). The novel's paratexts—title, dedication, and epigraph—perhaps hold the key to the relationship. The Power and the Glory was published "under the difficult and misleading title" The Labyrinthine Ways "chosen by the publisher" in America, because Phyllis Bentley's romance of the English Civil War had pre-empted Greene's title in the copyright office. 9 The American edition is dedicated "To Vivien [Greene's wife] With Dearest Love," but both the proofs and the English edition have "To Gervase" who is yet to be identified. Almost as significant as the title change is the American omission of the epigraph "Th' inclosure narrow'd; the sagacious power | Of hounds and death drew nearer every hour" drawn from John Dryden's The Hind and the Panther (Part II, lines 5-6), an important work of Catholic apologetics. The passage refers to the persecution of Catholics following the Popish Plot and probably also during the Commonwealth, thus offering a historical parallel to the Mexican Revolution. Omission of these lines—they still appear in no American edition—constitutes a major substantive change not only because the omission is unauthorized but also because Greene's epigraph defines the conflicts of the novel, predicates the action, establishes tone and theme, and functions as the first bit of interpretative rhetoric in the text. 10 At one time the novel had a second epigraph—"The best of what we do and are, | Just God, forgive!"—drawn from William Wordsworth's "Thoughts Suggested the Day Following, On the Banks of Nith, Near the Poet's Residence," one of his three memorial poems on Robert Burns. 11 Because this epigraph was still in the unmarked proofs, we can surmise that it was not in the printer's copy sent to America or else that it was cancelled by letter. Revision of the title and omission of the Dryden epigraph hint Viking's interventions in the text, but presence of the "Gervase" dedication and the two epigraphs in the unmarked proofs suggests that the American edition was either set from an early duplicate typescript or that Greene communicated some but not all changes to Viking by letter. 12 The 111 substantive variants (12 inversions, 82 changes, 10 deletions, and 77 additions) separating the first editions fall into three groups: errors and corrections, American house-styling, and authorial revisions. The American text has "cose" (A224) instead of "cost" (E210), incorrectly adds an apostrophe to "hackles'" (A184/E170) but corrects "chicel" (E82) to "chicle" (A91); a spacing error crept into the English text giving "front on" (E145) rather than "fronton" (A157) in the sentence "it drove and jumped upon the cement floor of the useless fronton which had once been the cathedral . . . ." The Viking editors apparently also exercised a free hand in americanizing the text, because sixty-seven readings are unlike anything in the proofs or the English text. These range from addition of apostrophes to "barbers'," and "dentists'," (A10/E4) on the first pages of the novel to the use of "onto" (A10 et passim ), "a while" (A119, 200), and "Oh" (A14, 99) in place of "on to" (E4 et passim ), "awhile" (E109, 185), and "O" (E7, 90), 13 to variant spellings of "Brigitta" (E76 et passim ), "Pueblito" (E78), and "hooves" (E122, 231) as "Brigida" (A84 et passim ), "Pueblita" (A86), and "hoofs" (A132, 247). Elsewhere, a number of phrases were inverted—for example, "in if he could with steel" (E27) became "in with steel if he could" (A33), "You do not always say good-bye to those you love beside a deathbed" (E84) became "To those you love you do not always say good-bye beside a deathbed" (A93), and "walked as if his shoes were cramping him delicately to the bed" (E135) changed to "walked delicately to the bed as if his shoes were cramping him" (A147), although knowing that one of Greene's most frequent revisions in typescripts and proofs is inversion, I suspect that this is further evidence that the American text records an early reading. 14 Substitution of "Whom" (A87, 109), "she" (A42), "were" (A18) for "Who" (E78, 99), "her" (E36), and "was" (E12) shows American grammar replacing English idiom, just as "hanged" (A39), "rooted" (A56), "awakened" (A94), "buzzed" (A109) and "within" (A209) crowded out "hung" (E32), "routed" (E49), "woken" (E85), "burred" (E100), and "in" (E194). The American text is also fussy over pronoun reference, often replacing a pronoun with a noun to avoid ambivalent antecedents. Only once does the change seem necessary: "The priest" (A58) replaced "He" (E51) in the sentence "The priest fell uneasily asleep . . . ." Because the paragraph had described both the priest and an old man, some certainty of reference is necessary to specify who goes to sleep. Only twice, though, does the American text make significant changes. "Bandage" (E167) became "muffle" (A190) in "he thought of a man he had once shrived who was on the point of death with cancer—his relatives had had to muffle their faces, the smell of the rotting interior was so appalling." An eye-skip on the part of a compositor may account for the omission of "He was shaken by the sense of his own uselessness" (A182/E168) in the description of the priest's feelings as he and the others leave the jail cell. The sentence is crucial in that it early signals the priest's true humility. The sentence does appear in the proofs. Occasionally, the American text omits words its editor might have considered redundant, as when "quick" was struck from "a quick furtive look" (A275/E256). The proofs read "a quick, furtive look" (P256) capturing the nervousness of the action with the comma which Greene apparently deleted when revising them. The remaining thirty-one variants appear to have entered the text as authorial page-proof revisions. In them, we see Greene sharpening details, correcting facts, avoiding repetition, and occasionally shifting meaning. As always, a few variants appear indifferent, though at the moment of revision, they must have struck the author as being necessary. Among these are revisions of "small plaza" (A26) to "little plaza" (E20), "maguey" (A142) to "mescal" (E130), "received" (A174) to "experienced" (E160) in "he had a sense of companionship which he had never received in the old days when pious people came kissing his black cotton gloves," and the four revisions of "scrumpled" (A113, 187, 194, 212) to "crumpled" (E103, 173, 179, 197). 15 Among these might be included the changes of "A Colt No. 5" (A77) to "A Colt .38" (E69) and "stopping" (A295) to "filling" (E274). In revising "he picked the book up" (A24) to "he shut the book up" (E19), Greene corrected a minor detail since Tench had "picked up" the book two sentences earlier. The description of Tench preparing to write his wife because "an old impulse had come to him" (A61) was corrected to "an odd impulse" (E54). The impulse must be "odd" because it had not existed before the priest's visit. The priest creates something new in Tench in terms of his past rather than reawakening an "old" impulse. Elsewhere, Greene strove to avoid repetition as when "all the lines" (A125) "land away?" (A218), and "the heavy stormy sunlight" (A251) were changed to "the lines" (E115), "land?" (E204), and "the stormy sunlight" (E235). The first deletes a word already used in the sentence; the second avoids a word used in the following sentence; the third avoids redundancy since the image "stormy" already includes "heavy." Occasionally, the revision sharpens imagery, as when "something left over" (A163) in the description of the soldiers, "A few men moved in the hammocks—a large unshaven jaw hung over the side like something left over on a butcher's counter," became "something left unsold" (E150). The revision more effectively captures the idea of rejection. The other items on the counter have been considered and sold; this one, however, has been passed over, rejected by the customers as unworthy. Changing "refused" (A243) in "It wouldn't really have been a good dream—that confession in Las Casas when he had to admit, as well as everything else, that he had refused confession to a man dying in mortal sin" to "denied" (E227) more clearly picks up religious connotations and hence heightens the priest's potential failings. Several revisions are genuinely important in terms of understanding character. Two, the revisions of "Carlota. Carlota" (A37) to "Brigitta. Brigitta" (E30) and "in pain" (A73) to "in her woman's pain" (E65), have already been mentioned. One revision, "though" (A248) to "enough" (E231) in "Poor man, the priest thought, he isn't really bad though . . ." reverses meaning in that it significantly changes the priest's opinion of the mestizo from denying evil in the half-caste to stressing it and its limitations. Elsewhere, near the end of the novel, Greene readjusted one point in the discussion between the priest and the lieutenant. Originally, the priest explained "It's not worth bothering too much about a little pain here. There's one belief we both of us have—that it will all be much the same in a hundred years" (A262). 16 The critical temper which fastens on one sentence, sometimes one word, to validate an interpretation could take this passage as the priest's ironic expression of failure. After all, what difference does the present conflict over pain and its uses or cures matter since all will be much the same in succeeding generations? Greene revised this to read "It's not worth bothering too much about a little pain here. There's one belief we both of us have—that we'll all be dead in a hundred years" (E244). Suddenly the passage stresses the significance of the conflict while reminding the actors of their insignificant existence. The individuals will die, but the conflict will continue. This thought is more in keeping with the numerous allusions throughout the novel which stress the permanent opposition between the religious outlook arguing that the causes of pain are inherent in man's nature and hence cannot be removed and the political outlook arguing that the causes for pain reside in faulty institutions or individuals and can hence be cured as soon as these are reformed or destroyed. 17 In addition to the substantives, 532 accidental variants separate the two editions, indicating the extensive house-styling Viking imposed on this as well as on the other Greene novels. 18 When queried about the publication of Greene's works, a Viking editor, Edwin Kennebeck responded: we have produced Graham Greene's books in different ways. sometimes we got duplicate typescripts from Mr. Greene, and did out own styling—mostly following the style of Collins Authors' and Printers' Dictionary. Sometimes we used the English publisher's proofs, making occasional improvements in the case of typographical errors, etc. Mr. Greene usually read our proofs and answered our queries, sometimes acceding to our suggestions for changes. He generally showed little concern for "accidentals," and generally accepted our minimum styling, recognizing that U. S. practice differs from British (the British seem to be much more likely to accept an author's manuscript as is, without trying to correct obvious inconsistencies). Sometimes Mr. Greene sent a few corrections to be inserted at some stage or other (including later reprints of books already published). 19 In The Power and the Glory , Viking's minimum house-styling seems concentrated on spelling, punctuation, paragraphing, and other changes which sometimes acquire significance by becoming semi-substantive in nature. Viking regularly changes the "-ise" spellings to "-ize" but retains the "-our" spellings. It uses "grille," "zareba," "griffon," "hooves," "storied," "slyly," and "rooted" rather than "grill," "zariba," "griffin," "hoofs," "slily," "storeyed," and "routed." Collins Dictionary recommends "grille" and "slyly," but prefers "griffon" and "zariba." Compounds presented as two words in the English text become one word ("undernourished," "whitewashed," "stomachache"), or hyphenated words ("down-river," "house-keeper," "up-hill"), whereas two-word phrases are sometimes hyphenated ("oil-lamp," "deathbed"). Viking's goal of consistency was never achieved, though, because the text contains both "police station," "whitewashed," "courtyard" and "police-station," "white-washed," and "court-yard." Analogously, identical adjectival phrases also appear inconsistently, for example, as "badly-affected" and "hand beaten." The Viking text italicized all Spanish and Latin words, phrases, and sentences, missing only "sala," regularized ellipses at the ends of sentences to four dots, and added the typical American comma before the final item in series and after introductory phrases and clauses. It capitalized all titles such as "Governor," "President," and even "Señorita," and attempted to capitalize all references to the deity and to church ritual acts: for example, Contrition, Confession, Absolution, He, Him, His, Thy, etc. The results sometimes are inappropriate, as when the "holy book," the life of Juan being read by the mother to her children in counterpoint to the priest's life, is capitalized. In addition to affecting the appearance of the page and the texture of the prose, the Viking text subtly affects meaning at times with its heavier, more rhetorical punctuation. Its punctuation of "'We'll be in before dark?' the lieutenant said" (A269) is quite inappropriate but the insertion elsewhere of question marks with rhetorical questions and exclamation marks with interior dialogue may be more appropriate though no more authorial. It added question marks to the mestizo's jailyard talk with the priest: "'It would be better, wouldn't it, to catch you out of here? In the town somewhere?" (A185) as it did to the lieutenant's "and it's your duty, isn't it, to forget it at once?" (A261) and to the priest's examples of love's powers: "'It [God's love] set fire to a bush in the desert, didn't it, and smashed open graves and set the dead walking in the dark?" (A269). Elsewhere, it freely distributed exclamation marks—far more freely than Greene intended—to Captain Fellows' remark "'What an extraordinary thing!'" (A43), to the governor's cousin's comment " Fifteen pesos!'" (A148) where it does pick up the text's direction "exclaimed," and to "Mother of God!" (A156), the Red Shirt's interjection when the priest bumps his elbow as he attempts a billard shot. It also handles interpolations quite differently. Where the English text reads "It might prove awkward—if she had married again" (E54), the American text has ". . . awkward, if . . ." (A61), thus destroying the intended sense of the sentence. The American text establishes that a letter from Tench would be awkward if his wife had remarried: the English stresses that a letter would be awkward, no matter what, and especially awkward if—an afterthought—she had remarried. The dash more effectively captures the hesitation and turn of thought. A crucial date in the textual history of The Power and the Glory is the 1948 publication of The Heart of the Matter , Greene's first commercial success since The Man Within (1929) which had had a promising sale of 8,000 copies ( SL , 140). Nine novels later, however, Greene had not repeated this initial success. The popularity of The Heart of the Matter , though, led Heinemann to reprint The Power and the Glory and Greene's earlier novels in a Uniform edition (and its variant binding the Library edition), 20 thus enabling Greene to make another 158 substantive revisions in the text (4 inversions, 110 changes, 35 deletions, and 9 additions). When a full history of Greene's texts and a biography are written, the years 1947-1950 will probably loom significantly as a transitional period not only in terms of Greene's commercial success but also in terms of his attitude towards his texts. In the Introduction to The Heart of the Matter Greene states that his "writing had become rusty with disuse and misuse" ( HM , vii), and the Introduction to The End of the Affair opens with the plaint "The slow discovery by a novelist of his individual method is exciting, but a moment comes in middle-age when he feels he no longer controls his method; he has become its prisoner. Then a long period of ennui sets in: it seems to him that he has done everything before" ( EA , vii). These words describe a moment in late 1948 when the novel began to take shape. Paradoxically, success arrived at the time Greene was experiencing doubts about his creativity and talents, especially over "fidelity to his manner . . . and the desire to discover new formulations for himself" described so ably by Edward Said. 21 The revisions in The Power and the Glory hint an uncertainty and an artistic tiredness. For example, a fourth of the changes involve two slight adjustments—changing "buzzards" to "vultures" fourteen times and substituting "asked" for "said" twenty-one times in questions. The first edition has both "vultures" and "buzzards," and the "said" to "asked" changes are part of a larger tendency to find some variety and some color with the eternal "he said" difficulty in dialogue. For example, elsewhere, "said" becomes the more descriptive "whispered" (U4), "explained" (U47), "continued" (U78), "went on" (U180), and "urged" (U235). Revising "asked" (E5) to "whispered" (U4) in the sentence "Somebody whispered in English," adds a secretive, almost conspiratorial tone to the priest's initial speech to Tench on the riverside. Likewise, "explained" (U47) is more effective than "said" (E47) in conveying Coral's almost patronizing tone in telling the priest that he could renounce his faith and thus escape the necessity of flight. Beyond these, Greene's revisions concern corrections, deleting "again" in "down again" (U9) in describing Tench laying down a cast for the first time. Throughout his text, Greene shows a concern for tightening phrasing. Analogies such as "painfully: it was as" (E115) become "painfully, as" (U160) and adjectival constructions such as "lesson it had learnt" (E235) become "lesson learnt" (U242). All the revisions indicate a basic satisfaction with the text except for certain local effects within individual sentences. Greene deleted the very inappropriate description of Luis's sisters "enjoying themselves like Hell" (U61/E60), as he did the "leopard" of the snake raising itself "like an affronted woman on the path" (U97/E103). The priest no longer feels "anxiety or despair" (U78), because "horror" is foreign to his response to anything in the ten year's of wandering. Instead of merely stating that he had "betrayed God not even for real lust" (E122), he now questions ". . . betrayed God for what? Not even for real lust" (U126). The revision is slight but in sharpening the rhetorical question Greene hints the priest's growth as a character as he now questions why he had acted as he did. His prayers which were "like undigested food heavy in his body, unable to escape" (E190) become prayers which "weigh him down like undigested food" (U197), similar to revisions in The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Affair . 22 Finally the lieutenant who originally told the priest, I "hate your guts" (E249) now simply says "hate you" (U257). The revision keeps the focus on the entire individual and broadens the extent of the lieutenant's hatred. One wonders if two of the variants are printer's errors or puns. In one of those instances of the natural world counterpointing the human world and usually setting up a risible situation, the priest listens to confessions in the Lehr's barn while a horse frequently breaks wind in the background: the horse "blew windily in the dark as the sins came whispering out" (E216). Greene or someone changed "whispering" to "whimpering" (U221). Near the end of the novel, Greene originally described Mrs. Fellows as "bunched up" (E270) but changed this to "hunched up" perhaps to avoid the pun with bananas mentioned a few lines earlier. 23 The remaining variants involve an equal number of errors and corrections, pronoun changes to avoid ambiguous references, tightened analogies, avoidance of repetitive or superfluous phrasing, and verbal changes. Usually such changes as "is" (E178) to "was" (U185), "was back" (E217) to "were back" (U222), and "had to admit" (E227) to "would have had to admit" (U233) concern only slight adjustments or corrections of verb tense, but often such changes tighten the verbal structure: for example, "caught himself up" (E232) becomes "checked himself" (U239), and "was sent spinning" (E18) becomes "spun" (U18), or create a slightly more telling change as when "a whole world had ended" (E85) becomes "a whole world had died" (U85) or when the priest's desires become more conscious in the revision of "needed" (E103) to "wanted" (U104). Once the change of tense generalizes an entire sentence moving it from the local effect of the character's mind to the narrative voice's general truths when "Hope was an instinct only the reasoning human mind could kill. An animal never knew despair" (E177) becomes "Hope is an instinct only the reasoning human mind could kill. An animal never knows despair" (U183). "Sentimental in that way" (E195) became "Sentimental in that respect" (U203) to avoid repetition of "the way" earlier in the sentence, and phrases such as "it was as" (E155) and "it was like" (E215) were shortened to "as" (U160) and "like" (U220). Although the Uniform edition did correct several errors from the first edition (the apostrophe in "barbers'" [U2], the spacing in "fronton" [U150], the phrasing in "Gulf to Vera Cruz" [U30], and "away, the Pacific" [U30]), several additional errors, none significant, crept into the text, most obviously a missetting of "woman" (U53) for "women" (E53) when the plural is indicated by the context, "here" (U233) for "there" (E227) when the priest, still at the Lehrs', thinks of the gangster as being "here," the omission of an article in the phrase "to include a griffon and oak leaf" (U190/E183), and possibly "to her" (U65) rather than "there" (E64) in the sentence "She felt no resentment at all at being there, looking after things: the word 'play' had no meaning to her at all—the whole of life was adult." Although such revisions as "riverside" (E5) to "bank" (U3), "curious" (E91) to "inquisitive" (U92), "not frightened" (E91) to "unfrightened" (U92) "way of life" (E206) to "mode of life" (U210), and "drew" (E69) to "pulled" (U70) are indifferent in their effects, many other revisions expunge superfluous phrasing, clarify references, and turn to a more felicitious word. Why not use "them" (U281) to avoid repeating "his eyes" (E274) which appeared in the preceding sentence or describe a crop as "meagre and inadequate" (U113) when "meagre, limited and inadequate" (E111) is redundant? Similarly, "all the way" is unnecessary in the description of the gangster following "them all the way" (E195/U203) because if he followed them at all, he obviously has followed "all the way," just as if José's bed "filled up half" (E33) the room, it also "filled half" (U32). A number of the revisions simply involve substituting a synonym; for example, "mouth" (U186) for "muzzle" (E180), "things" (U179) for "something" (U173), "grid" (U263) for "grill" (E255), and "turned away" (U270) for "turned its back" (E261). There are also a few inversions such as "He himself" (E24) to "Himself he" (U23) and "The word sounded odd and archaic and local in the little stony town" (E57) to "The word in the little stony town sounded odd and archaic and local" (U57). Several times, "he said" (E102, 268/U103, 276) was cancelled when the identity of the speaker was obvious. Revision of "It lay" (E9) to "Home lay" (U7), "He" (E104) to "the priest" (U105), and "the message" (E237) to "that message" (U244) simply clarifies antecedents when ambiguity is possible in the original phrasing. Once, however, in "not, father" (E79) to "not that, father" (U78) the clarified reference is essential. The priest has asked two questions of the villagers—have they heard of Padre José, do they wish him to be like José—and it is essential that their answer be in response to the second, not the first question. Changing "restlessly" (E44) to "aimlessly" (U44) in describing Captain Fellows was also a nice touch in that it more effectively captures the feckless lack of direction and planning in the Fellows' world, just as deletion of "he shared it" from the sentence "He had touched the taboo—he shared it, the bond was broken" (E38/U44) sets him apart from his death-entranced wife. In the Introduction to It's a Battlefield , Greene explained: "I have seldom had the courage to re-read a book of mine more than once and that immediately after publication, when I check it for misprints and for the small changes which I ought not to have missed, in manuscript, typescript and proof, so that I may have a marked copy ready for another edition if one is ever required" ( IAB , ix). The Uniform edition of The Power of the Glory may have evolved in this way. Attention should also be called to the accidental variants between the first English and the Uniform edition. There are 786, an unexpectedly large number, since there are only 46 between the two editions of The End of the Affair . 24 The number, of course, is inflated because 582 involve use of a comma rather than a colon after the word introducing dialogue. Indeed, the four large categories of colon to comma (582), colon to semicolon (65), colon to period (30) with the following word capitalized as a result of the change (17), and the inversion of the order of punctuation and quotation marks (13) account for 724 or ninety-two per cent of the variants—many or all dictated perhaps by editorial decision in the resetting of the edition. The colon-to-period change seems effected to avoid two- and three-colon sentences. A few of the variants, however, result in semi-substantives. For example, early in the novel, the chief of police tells the lieutenant that the American gangster shot two G men. The lieutenant responds "'G'" (E24) to which the Uniform added a question mark, giving some point to the sentence (U23). Elsewhere, the priest tells Coral "'The boat was leaving and then—I was summoned" (E46). Deletion of the dash (U46) shifts the focus of the sentence. Either punctuation is effective: the dash indicates that "I was summoned" is an afterthought which breaks in upon the priest's mind as a moment of sudden realization that he was summoned through God's will; deletion of the dash keeps this idea but there is no hesitation or uncertainty. Likewise, capitalization of "He" (U167) in "If God intended him to escape He could snatch him away from in front of a firing squad" heightens the relationship between the priest and his god. An entirely different Greene from the Greene of 1948-49 returned to The Power and the Glory in 1970 or 1971 in preparing the text for the collected edition. No longer was Greene still awaiting commercial success and widespread critical reception; instead he was an established author, some would say the dean of living English novelists, secure in his reputation. However, between 1940 and 1970, two things, over which Greene had little control, had happened to his text, and Greene approved of neither. First, John Ford had filmed the novel as The Fugitive , extensively changing the conflicts and the characters. 25 Second, Cardinal Guiseppe Pizzardo of the Vatican had condemned the novel "because it was 'paradoxical' and 'dealt with extraordinary circumstances'" ( C , xi). Cardinal Archbishop Bernard William Griffin read the letter to Greene, as Greene recalls in A Sort of Life : In the 1950s I was summoned by Cardinal Griffin to Westminster Cathedral and told that my novel The Power and the Glory , which had been published ten years before, had been condemned by the Holy Office, and Cardinal Pizzardo required changes which I naturally—though I hope politely—refused to make. . . . he gave me, as a parting shot, a copy of a pastoral letter which had been read in the churches of his diocese, condemning my work by implication. 26 Cardinal Griffin's Pastoral Letter for Advent 1953, the one most likely given to Greene, contains more than a "parting shot." It roundly condemns unnamed sensational tabloids, particularly of the Sunday press, and then turns to novels which sin "against the sixth commandment . . . in thought and word. . . ." 27 Cardinal Griffin then seems to focus on Greene's The Power and the Glory, The Heart of the Matter , and The End of the Affair : It is sadly true that a number of Catholic writers appear to have fallen into this error. Indeed, novels which purport to be the vehicle for Catholic doctrine frequently contain passages which by their unrestrained portrayal of immoral conduct prove a source of temptation to many of their readers. . . . the presentation of the Catholic way of life within the framework of fiction may be an admirable object but it can never justify as a means to that end the inclusion of indecent and harmful material. There is a special mystique to a Collected edition and perhaps has been ever since Jonson and Shakespeare. A collected edition setting in uniform bindings and dust-jacketed volumes stretching across a shelf must give an author a sense of satisfaction, accomplishment, and arrival, although revisions for the edition raise serious questions concerning intention and technique. Greene turned to a military metaphor in describing a three-volume Oeuvres choisies of his work: "I sometimes see myself as a ragged troop commander driving his exhausted column on towards the last frontier. I have no wish to march at the pace of the stragglers; they must be left to the mercies, however harsh, that a hostile population may perhaps accord them." 28 So saying, he omitted The Man Within and Stamboul Train as he had earlier dropped The Name of Action and Rumour at Nightfall . However, when he turned his attention to The Power and the Glory he made certain that it did not "straggle." If The Power and the Glory followed the pattern of the other novels in the production of the Collected edition outlined by Roland Gant, Greene marked a copy of the Uniform edition which was then photocopied by Heinemann for use as printer's copy by Heinemann and Bodley Head. The revisions, for the Collected edition, 113 in number (2 inversions, 12 additions, 44 deletions, and 55 changes), are not extensive, but they take two interesting directions. First, there are numerous deletions, almost as though Greene were paring his novel down to a minimal structure. Second, the prison scene experienced much minor revision. Three tendencies, evident from the first edition, remain obvious: changes of "said" to more descriptive terms, changes of verb tense, and selection of more colorful diction in a few instances. "Said" becomes the more emphatic "asked" (C38) and "answered" (C198). Elsewhere, "said with a kind of exultation" (E25) becomes the tighter "demanded" (C22) and "shot" (E8) becomes "spat" (C6), shifting from a figurative to a literal description of Tench spitting out his bile. Usually, the revisions are more descriptive, more contextually precise, and more emphatic. Considering the uncertainties in the world of the novel, it is appropriate that "safety" (E111) became "relative safety" (C105), and Maria's "'I'm his wife'" (C87) is a slightly more accurate reply to the lieutenant than "'It's me'" (E93). In addition, the Collected edition contains a number of corrections of misprints, verb tenses, and details—such matters as necessary apostrophes with "dentists'" (C2), correcting "Mexico" (E67) to "Mexico City" (C63) to make a reference to the capital more precise, changing "commented" (U14) to "commanded" (C13) in Tench's order to the child, correcting the idiom in the "routine of his life like a dam was cracked and forgetfulness came dribbling in" to "dribbling through" (C68), revising verb tense from past to present in describing a martyr who "prays for us" (C134), and thrice changing "case" (E11, 212, 274) to "cast" (C9, 201, 261) in references to Tench's dental work and the priest's memory. There are more than the usual number of indifferent revisions, however, where no loss or gain occurs for the text: "began to blow" (E18), "father" (E38), "began" (E54), "stirring" (E89), "ringing up" (E257) and "the oddest thing" (E184), scarcely differ from "became evident" (C16), "dad" (C35), "started" (C50), "astir" (C87), "chiming up" (C246), and "an odd thing" (C176), though "dad" is more informal, and "an odd thing" removes the superlative. One revision however, results in an error. Greene changed "six days" (E211) to "three days" (C200) in describing the journey to Las Casas though elsewhere references remain to six days. Three important points need to be made concerning the other revisions: first, an unusual number of deletions occur; second, twenty-four of the revisions cluster in the jail-cell scene, the crucial scene in the novel; third, a number of revisions concentrate on the priest's perception of himself and his relationship with his world. One of the two prison-world metaphors, as has been pointed out, was deleted, and such passages as the following also were cancelled: "Are you a German?" they might have said, with incredulity at the similar face, or: "Are you English?" (E125/C119) It must sometimes be a comfort to a soldier that the atrocities on either side were equal: nobody was ever alone. (E125/C119) You may be a saint for all I know, (E232/C221) . . . it was the first definite indication that they and the half-caste were not alone. (E237/C226) He felt the trap close again, irrevocably. (E226/C215) . . . just so he could be certain Coral would arrange the final evacuation. (E39/C35) . . . the gate was closed which would one day let it in. (E42/C38) The novel contains a surprising number of references to World War I, but only those in Charles Fellows' thoughts seem appropriate to the characters' backgrounds. The first two passages were probably omitted because the war experience was foreign to the priest's background and possibly because Greene did not wish to leave the impression that somehow the causes of the priest and the lieutenant were roughly equal in value as were those of the English and Germans in World War I, as his original sentences imply. The third deletion, one of the half-caste's comments about the priest, removes a pointed evaluation, perhaps too pointed since Greene made similar deletions in The Heart of the Matter and A Burnt-Out Case . 29 The reference to Coral became inappropriate also since Mrs. Fellows actually arranged the "final evacuation." Also, deletion of the passage shifts the focus of the paragraph away from the mother and totally to Coral. Any passage—however effective in context—which apparently struck Greene as unnecessary, slightly inaccurate, or wanting in any way—fell to his pen. Among these were several similes—"out like a curtain" (E134/C128) and "hut like a piece of furniture" (E190/C182)—, a description of the contents of bottles—"small fingers of crudely coloured liquid lay in some of them" (E178/C170)—, and a grisly joke made by the priest over the matter of boundaries between the two states—"A mile or two makes no difference. Nobody here's likely to bring an action" (E225/C214). Although he did not extensively reshape the character of the priest as he did Henry Scobie in The Heart of the Matter and Richard Smythe in The End of the Affair , Greene did make the priest less sophisticated, more truly humble, and more aware of his failings. Originally, the priest "spoke English" (E6); now he speaks only "a little English" (C4), thus making him less educated, less worldly, and less experienced despite his years in the Arizona seminary. The sentence "Time was elastic: it stretched to snapping-point" (E176/C168) also disappeared from his thoughts, possibly because such a time awareness is too sophisticated for the priest who thinks largely in terms of seasons and the approaching rains. Moreover, it is an entirely different personality who can say "I have no sense of responsibility" (C188) rather than assert "I have no responsibility" (E195) while following the Indian woman on the way to bury her dead child. The earlier reading denied responsibility; the latter reading stresses the need for responsibility but the failure to feel it. The priest at this point is "tormented by ideas" and feels responsible for the woman and "the American as well" (C188). Elsewhere, his responsibility becomes "overwhelming" (C157) where it was once "enormous" (E164) signalling both a burden and a recognition that what is required is beyond his ability. In the first edition, the priest "tried—mechanically—to relieve his fear" (E65) by scratching crosses into the wall of Fellows' barn. By excising "mechanically" (C61), Greene stressed the priest's movement beyond appearance to reality. "mechanically" suggests that he scratched the crosses as a bored, unconscious action having no meaning to him. Nor does the priest criticize himself anymore saying "They deserve a martyr to care for them—not a fool like me, who loves all the wrong things" (E118). "Man" (C112) replaced "fool" because the priest knows he is a man—aware of and responsible for his actions during the last ten years; he is no "fool" and certainly not a "divine fool." The jail cell seems to provide a microcosm of Greene's revisions, evidencing as it does all of his typical revisions designed to hone this most crucial part of the novel. Clauses such as "the lumpy blackness seemed to shift and stir" (E151/C144) and "forty miles, superstition said" (E152/C145) were inexplicably excised, and phrases such as "muffled painless cries" (E152), "their hooded and cramped pleasure" (E154), "an enormous and irrational" (E158) "feet like leprosy" (E161), "had somewhere fallen" (E161), "woman disappear—as if for ever—through" (E172) and "thought with relief" (E173) become "muffled cries" (C146), "their cramped pleasure" (C147), "an irrational" (C151), "feet" (C154), "had fallen" (C154), "woman go off through" (C165), and "thought" (C166) as Greene strove to remove all melodramatic or strained effects. Since the woman in the cell does give a "tiny scream" of sexual enjoyment, "painless" became slightly inappropriate as did "hooded" with its connotations of secretive and "somewhere" since the old man has fallen asleep not "somewhere" but directly against the priest himself. Four times "horror" disappeared from the priest's reactions. Once the priest has accepted the possibility that a god can love the entire world, he has no reason to realize "with horror" (E152/C146) that the couple in the cell is enjoying sexual pleasure, nor does he need to protest "in feeble horror" (E151/C145) when he accidentally steps on someone's hand. Far more accidental variants, 473 in all, separate the Collected from the Uniform than the orderly succession of texts leads one to expect. 30 Heinemann chose to make certain design changes for the Collected Edition: single quotation marks in place of double quotations, no periods after abbreviations rather than periods, arabic numerals instead of roman numerals, spaced dashes rather than unspaced dashes, and asterisks rather than blank space separating scenes. However, there are numerous other changes, many of them designed to shorten the sentence length and to remove the hesitant syntax created by use of dashes and ellipses. Several hundred colons were changed to semi-colons, commas, and periods. For example, a sentence such as "The whole sky was blackening: the crosses stuck up like dry and ugly cacti: he made off to the edge of the plateau" (U202) became three short sentences as the associative cluster sentences of the earlier texts acquired a simpler syntax. The effect of the deleted dashes and ellipses is perhaps more immediately recognizable: "celebrating a birthday . . . alone" (U4) became "celebrating a birthday, alone" (C4), "it was like making your will—and might be as valueless" (U94) became "it was like making your will and might be as valueless" (C87), "went in—to complete darkness" (U113) became "went in to complete darkness" (C105), the mestizo's complaint "'You are leaving me here—to die'" (U125), became "You are leaving me here to die" (C116), and "I don't mind you telling—the right people" (C140) became simply "I don't mind you telling the right people" (C129). In these typical examples, Greene or his publisher has dispensed with the element of unexpected interpolation. The text becomes less melodramatic in its use of hesitations and emphatic pauses when the syntax is reoriented. The text also changes the spelling of some words—most noticeably "baptized" to "bapised" throughout—, corrects earlier errors such as the failure to paragraph (U4/C3) and the failure to provide a break between scenes (U278/C258) while adding only two apparent errors itself in an omitted comma (U109/C101) and the misspelling of "Presently" (U205) as "Presenly" (C190). Obviously, though, with the many accidental variants between the first, the Uniform, and the Collected editions, all generalizations concerning the typical Greene punctuation and syntax must be cautiously drawn. 31 Thus buffeted from without by the outbreak of World War II, which surely hurt early sales, from inadequate film adaptations, and from Church disapproval, The Power and the Glory has evolved to its present state through three periods of authorial revision and at least three house-stylings. The text has matured as repetitions, slack phrasings, strained images, and minor errors have gradually fallen to the side under searching authorial scrutiny. The revisions in The Power and the Glory , perhaps more clearly than those in any of his other novels, explain Greene's comments about the value of his Times experience "learning lessons valuable to his craft . . . removing the clichés . . . compressing a story to the minimum length possible without ruining its effect" ( SL , 129).</field>

I have not considered the Bantam reprints in this essay. 4 In "Bibliography and Modern Studies," Approaches to the Study of Twentieth-Century Literature (1963), pp. 12-13, Bruce Harkness noted this and three other variants in the text. He concluded that "a critic who admits that knowledge is one of our aims would insist that his students not use the Viking (Compass) edition . . . nor the even worse Bantam edition." 5 In A Sort of Life (1972), Greene writes: "In most of my novels I can remember passages, even chapters, which gave me at the time I wrote them a sense of satisfaction—'this at least has come off'. So I felt, however mistakenly, with the trial scene in The Man Within , and later with Querry's voyage in A Burnt-Out Case . . . [and] the prison dialogue in The Power and the Glory " (p. 144).

W. Heinemann, London, 7 July 1977. I wish to thank Mr. Gant and his colleagues for their willingness to discuss Greene's association with Heinemann and the production of the Uniform, Library, and Collected editions. Many Heinemann records were destroyed during the war, and at least some Viking records have also been destroyed, see note 19 below. 8 These unmarked proofs, hereafter cited as P , are in the Rare Book Room, McFarlin Library, University of Tulsa. For a complete description of the Greene holdings, see my "A Catalogue of the McFarlin Library Graham Greene Collection," forthcoming. I particularly wish to thank Mr. Michael Bleckner for his assistance and suggestions during my stay at the University of Tulsa. 9 Introduction, C , p. x. Bentley's book was published in America by Macmillan early in 1940, and, ironically, was reviewed and advertised opposite Greene's novel in Catholic World , 151 (May 1940), 253-254. Even though Greene has expressed his disapproval of the American title, it continues to attract unwarranted attention. The Viking Critical Edition, ed. R. W. B. Lewis and Peter J. Conn (New York, 1970) reprints the Francis Thompson poem, "The Hound of Heaven," from which the title was taken, draws attention to the title through study questions, and begins the introduction with a brief discussion of its significance (pp. 515-520, 537, and vii-viii). 10 The importance of epigraphs has been briefly noted by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), pp. 100 and 198, and more fully discussed in my "George Eliot and the Art of the Epigraph," NCF , 25 (1970), 126-51 and Time and English Fiction (1977), pp. 13-14, 109-11, 115-116, and 147. The theoretical problem of epigraphs was explored in the MLA Special Session, "Paratexts in Fiction," 28 December 1978. 11 The Wordsworth epigraph appears only in the unmarked proofs. Greene did extend his revisions to epigraphs late in the composition of his novels. A contemplated Dickens epigraph was dropped for A Burnt-Out Case and its Dante epigraph was not added until the final typed copy was completed. 12 Graham Greene to DLH, 4 April 1978; also see Note 19. 13 But see "a while" (E59) | "awhile" (A67) and "Oh" (E169,260) | "O" (A183,380). 14 In A Burnt-Out Case , Greene frequently inverted phrasing at all stages in composition from early drafts to page proofs; see note 8 above. Three inversions in The Power and the Glory are unquestionably authorial: "the priest's head round" (A78), "up apprehensively" (A262), and "taken tentatively up" (A276) changed to "round the priest's head" (E70), "up apprehensively" (E245), and "taken up tentatively" (E257). The A readings agree with the unmarked proofs. 15 In A Burnt-Out Case , the final typescript, proofs, and first English edition use "scrumpled" (E58) until the Collected changed it to "crumpled" (53). 16 The political implications of the novel were discussed in a review by Anthony West ( The New Statesman and Nation , 19 [16 March 1940], 372-373), who called the novel "a parable about the importance of Religion to the Individual and to Society told with great skill and power, and all the more interesting because it is so fundamentally opposed to everything for which Liberalism stands." 17 Early reviewers were accurate in viewing the novel as a "thesis" novel, but they erred in their focus. The TLS reviewer wrote: "what is otherwise unsatisfying in the story is its bleak division of human experience into shabby sins, lusts and violences on the one side, doctrinal salvation on the other. There seems to be hardly anything between—neither joy in life nor kindness, neither practical philosophy nor a gleam of humour. In brief, it is not so much as illusion of life that Mr. Greene achieves in this novel as an illustration of doctrine" (9 March 1940, p. 121). Ralph Bates concluded that "Mr. Greene has carried over his pietism into his revolutionary, that's all. What he needed in his last conversation was a revolutionary who had sounded his own philosophy to its depths, whose knowledge of men had been enriched by a humane sophistication. But then he would have needed a priest of similar capacities, and that might have strained the Tabascan probabilities" ( New Republic , 22 April 1940, p. 550). Needless to say, it would also have "strained" the novel. From a later perspective, it is easier to see the confrontation scenes between the priest and the lieutenant as typical of the parabolic literature perceptively surveyed by Samuel Hynes in The Auden Generation: Literature and Politics in England in the 1930s (1977), see pp. 312-313 in particular. 18 There are 570 variants between the English and American editions of A Burnt-Out Case , 1810 between the editions of The End of the Affair , and over 1100 between the editions of The Heart of the Matter . A full tabulation of the 532 accidental variants includes: commas added (106), quotation marks regularized (69), spelling changes (44), hyphenated forms to one word (37), italics added (32), ellipses corrected (30), lower case raised (30), accent omitted (25), changing capitalization (21), upper case lowered (19), two words hyphenated (14), hyphenated word to two words (14), other spelling changes (8), one word to hyphenated form (7), colon to semi-colon (7), comma to colon (6), comma to dash (6), comma to dash (6), comma deleted (4), and other miscellaneous changes (54). 19 Edwin Kennebeck to DLH, 24 November 1976. The house-styling guide mentioned is F. Howard Collins' Authors' and Printers' Dictionary: A Guide for Authors, Editors, Printers of the Press, Compositors and Typists , first published in 1905. 20 Collation has borne out Roland Gant's recollection that the two texts are identical except for the more substantial binding and the front pages. 21 Beginnings: Intention and Method (1975), pp. 254-255. Said continues: "During this third period in the career, innovation and repetition not only constitute the writer's judgments of what he is doing, they also parallel judgments of him made by his audience, by now accustomed to his idiom and to the particular place he occupies, through his text, in its mind. But whether or not author and audience agree in their judgment, it is nevertheless true that during this phase the writer judges his work much as a reader world" (p. 256). 22 In The End of the Affair , Greene deleted the clause, "the orgasm was over" from "The demon had done its work, the orgasm was over, I felt drained of venom" (A77, B67), and from The Heart of the Matter , he deleted "I can never void it" from "It's the coating of my stomach. I can never void it," see Compass Edition (New York: Viking, 1948), p. 259. 23 Harkness, p. 23, n. 22, suggests this explanation. Throughout the novel, however, there are an almost equal number of "bunched" and "hunched" bodies. 24 See note 6 above. There were 24 marks added, 6 deleted, and 16 changed. Otherwise, the two editions appear to have been printed from the same plates—unlike the editions of The Power and the Glory . The 786 accidental variants between the first and the Uniform include: colon to comma (582), colon to semicolon (65), colon to period (30), lower case raised (17), quotation mark and punctuation reversed (13), dash to comma (12), comma deleted (10), hyphen deleted (5), upper case lowered (4), comma added (4), semicolon to period (3), single quotation mark added (3), and other miscellaneous changes (38). 25 Ford's movie, The Fugitive , is an RKO film, released in 1947. As far as I know, Greene has not commented publicly on the Paramount 1962 television production starring George C. Scott as the lieutenant. 26 SL , p. 58. The Introduction to The Power and the Glory implies that the meeting occurred in 1955 ( C , p. xi), as it could have since Archbishop Griffin died 20 August 1956. The passage in A Sort of Life suggests an earlier date ("my novel . . . which had been published ten years before"). The meeting probably occurred in 1954 or early 1955. 27 Pastoral Letter of Cardinal Griffin Archbishop of Westminster for Advent 1953 , p. 7. I wish to thank Elisabeth R. Poyser, Archivist of the Archdiocese of Westminster, for her assistance in locating this pastoral letter. Cardinal Pizzardo's letter will not be available to study until after 1985. 28 Quoted in The Portable Graham Greene , ed. Philip Stratford (1977), p. 33. 29 Greene deleted "Like many a recognised saint" from Parkinson's description of Querry in A Burnt-Out Case (E147/C134) and several similar passages from The Heart of the Matter ; see note 6. 30 The full tabulation is as follows: colon to semi-colon (161), colon to period (119), colon to comma (43), spelling change (23), dash to comma (22), dash deleted (22), semicolon to period (17), dash to period (14), colon to dash (9), comma added (8), dash to semicolon (5), comma deleted (4), semi-colon to comma (4), semi-colon to colon (3), quotation-punctuation reversed (2), and 1 each for apostrophe added, apostrophe deleted, paragraphing corrected, ellipsis to comma, period to comma, colon to exclamation mark, ellipsis corrected, comma to colon, dash to colon, comma to semi-colon, and break in text added. 31 The most extensive discussion of Greene's punctuation is Dominic P. Consolo, "Graham Greene: Style and Stylistics in Five Novels," in Graham Greene: Some Critical Considerations , ed. Robert O. Evans (1963), pp. 61-95. Throughout his essay, Professor Consolo pays close attention to accidentals, unfortunately using the American texts as his source: "And what should be explained at this point is the stylistic function of the punctuation—especially of the colon, for it seems literally to pepper the pages of his novels. The colons set off from each other a series of succeeding clauses, but also tie them to the initial statement so that in themselves they have the simple force of a concluding statement and, in their succession, the added force of their syntactical combination. By using punctuation in this manner, Greene can strip his narrative of articles and connectives, vary the cadence by the number of the length of numbers in a sequence, and free the internal elements for unexpected interpolations" (p. 85).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">David Jones's Glosses on The Anathemata by Thomas Dilworth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">W. H. Auden called David Jones's The Anathemata "one of the most important poems of our time" and "probably the finest long poem in English in this century." A growing number of poets and critics agree. Unquestionably, The Anathemata is a work of vital and all-inclusive imagination. Its subject is no less than western civilization from its prehistoric beginnings. The work's frame of reference moves from modern times to the Jerusalem of Christ, to geological prehistory, and on to republican Rome, to classical Greece, and to a merchant ship in the second millennium B.C. The time then shifts to Anglo-Saxon England, to nineteenth-century London, to late-medieval Britain, to papal Rome, back to Jerusalem and finally back to modern times. In all this there are no associations of a personal and private nature such as mar the Cantos of Pound. Nor are the myths that inform the poem private, like those of Blake; they derive from historical traditions—classical, scriptural and medieval, Welsh, Norse and English. Because these traditions involve what is for most readers "unshared backround", David Jones provides his own annotations to the poem. These certainly help. But The Anathemata remains a difficult poem to read. Its density of allusion, its intricacy and breadth place it securely in what George Steiner calls "the hermetic or intimist tradition" of literary modernism. The Anathemata will never be a popular poem. But it is an important poem and will always have readers, though these will be grateful for whatever help they receive. 1 In this regard, they will necessarily be indebted to David Jones himself, not only for his published prose, his notes to the poem, and the letters that will someday be published, but also for the interpretive glosses he inscribed over the years in his own copies of The Anathemata . David Jones's handwritten marginal glosses appear in two copies of the first edition of the poem (London: Faber and Faber, 1952) that he owned at the time of his death in 1974, and which have since been deposited with the rest of his personal library in the National Library of Wales. 2 In contrast to the poem's preface and notes, which mostly explain the work's cultural and historical matrices, the marginalia comment directly on specific aspects of the poem itself. Sometimes fragmentary and cryptic, the glosses candidly record David Jones's personal clarifications and interpretations of the text. For example, they assign major importance to the motif of the voyage, the symbol of the ship, the figure of the captain and that of the mother of Christ. Moreover, the glosses imply a thematic interrelationship between this motif and these images. Certain of the marginalia, further-more, suggest what appear to be some of the structural principles and relationships informing the poem's composition. This is especially likely if, as specific marginal references suggest, many of the glosses were written within a year of the poem's publication. 3 In various ways, the marginal glosses of David Jones constitute an authoritative commentary on The Anathemata . One of the copies of the poem in which the marginalia appear was, according to the poet's inscription on the front end-papers, "received from Fabers, Oct 17th 1952". In this copy are a series of brief, hastily written glosses entered by David Jones on the fifth of May, 1953, as he listened to the two-hour radio dramatization of sections of The Anathemata on the B.B.C. Third Programme. These marginal comments, which record a mixed reaction to the programme, do not gloss the poem directly. But they do give some indication of how David Jones thought his poem should (and should not) be read aloud. Comments such as "Good", "OK", and "Very Good indeed" register his emphatic approval of Dylan Thomas's rendition of the section of the poem entitled "MABINOG'S LITURGY". 4 Of Diana Maddox's reading of "THE LADY OF THE POOL", however, his remarks record a thoroughgoing, sometimes anguished, disapproval. She reads "too fast", in contrast to the slower pace of Dylan Thomas. 5 And she reads in the self-consciously dramatic way that David Jones particularly disliked in the reading of poetry by many professional actors. About Norman Shelley's reading of the "REDRIFF" section, David Jones writes on page 121, "All part IV very badly done". His objection here is partly to the section's being read in a Cockney accent. I remember David Jones once saying that "the right accent is home-county; Churchill had a bit of it, and George V. The 'g's were dropped at the ends of words and it was 'gels' instead of 'girls'." Before the date of broadcast, David Jones had unsuccessfully urged Douglas Cleverdon, the programme's producer, to have the accent corrected or to omit "REDRIFF" from the programme. In the following list of marginalia, I omit the many and repetitive comments on the radio broadcast, together with David Jones' occasional protests at the radio-script's deletion of lines and passages from sections of the poem. All other marginalia, that gloss the poem directly, are recorded below, under the headings of the sections of the poem in which they appear. The glosses are preceded by page and line numbers. In most instances, these are followed by words of the poem in quotation marks and then by the poet's marginal gloss in italics. An asterisk marks page and line references to the copy of the poem in which Jones recorded his reactions to the radio broadcast. I have, in most cases, interpreted the relationship of gloss to text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. RITE AND FORE-TIME 53.11 "They make all shipshape " [Jones's underlining] pivot for Argosy II p. 95—IV [sic] 182 David Jones used the words "voyage" and "argosy" interchangeably. Here he indicates a correspondence between the cenacle that Peter and John prepare for the Last Supper and the symbolic voyage subsuming those of all the ships in the poem. This archetypal voyage begins on page 95 with a Greek vessel's approach to the port of Athens in the fifth century B.C., and concludes, on page 182, with the Greek vessel's final berthing beneath the Acropolis. In the pages between the approach and the final berthing, a number of voyages take place in various historic periods. These voyages are all, with minor variations, westerly and then northerly in direction, and so trace a single course. Their directional consistency suggests that all the poem's ships typologically partake of the symbolic world-ship elaborately described in Part VI of the poem and here identified with the Supper room. Its sailing constitutes the single voyage of redeemed mankind. Jones writes, in An Introduction to Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1972), that "there is but one voyager's yarn to tell" (31)—the story of man, which is also, archetypically, that of Christ. 53.20 ". . . before all oreogenesis" pivot for Vorzeit The reference here is to "the Vorzeit -masque" (63) in which men dance to the climatic oscillations of the Permocarboniferous glaciation, which was the last ice-age. The geological time of oreogenesis, when mountains were formed, occurred millions of centuries before men evolved and were able to dance during the most recent glaciation. The Precambrian oscillations of oreogenesis are analogous to those of glaciation, though the latter were much shorter in duration. In "RITE AND FORE-TIME", oreogenesis is seen as preparatory to, and somehow continuous with, the ice-age of human prehistory when man performed ritual dances to the rhythm of the geological music. Between pages 186 and 187, David Jones placed a loose piece of paper on which he writes that the most remarkable part is the first Rite &amp; Foretime: 'the Vorzeit masque is on that moves to the cosmic introit' The grt winter &amp; grt summer chant the lauds of fire &amp; ice. All in relation to the Eucharist. During Precambrian oreogenesis, climatic variation coincides with fluctuation in the height of mountains: "for one Great Summer / lifted up / by next Great Winter / down" (55). These processes begin the choric chanting of a cosmic lauds that culminates in the Benedicite of the last great glaciation (63). Then men, not mountains, dance, and in anticipation of the eucharistic rite—in which all ritual acts have their symbolic and theological culmination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. MIDDLE-SEA AND LEAR-SEA 96.14 "Up she looms" Here, or 16 lines previously?, according to HG begins 'the whole argosy of mankind' to end on p. 182 . The text of the poem refers to the thirty-foot bronze statue of Athena Promachos that dominates the Acropolis in the fifth century B.C. and is seen by men on the Greek ship. The phrase "the whole argosy of mankind" ('argosy' here meaning voyage) appears in Jones's Introduction to Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" (30, 38), and apparently originates with the poet's friend Harman Grisewood. Jones tentatively, and correctly, suggests that the voyage starts not here but on the previous page, where the Greek ship first begins the approach to its home port of Athens. See the gloss on 53.11 above. 102.23* ". . . and must go a compass' Here David Jones draws a sketch indicating a ship reversing its course or, in nautical language, going a compass. 103.11 "Clōse-cōwled, in hĭs mâst hēād stāll the sôlităry cântŏr" This line Jones scans for syllabic quantity, and possibly for stress (mâst, sôlitary, cântor).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. ANGLE-LAND 115, note 2 "How Balin met with his brother Balan . . ." cf. In Par by misadventure Here, at the end of the section concerning the settlement of England by Angles and Saxons, modern British and Germans fighting during the World Wars are compared to the brothers in Malory who mistakenly slay each other. The modern wars are fratricidal because of the consanguinity of the English and Anglo-Welsh with the Germans owing to the medieval settlement of Angle-land. Jones's gloss refers to the dedication of In Parenthesis (1937), "TO THE ENEMY / FRONT FIGHTERS WHO SHARED OUR / PAINS AGAINST WHOM WE FOUND / OURSELVES BY MISAD-VENTURE."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. THE LADY OF THE POOL 124.1 "Did he meet Lud at the Fleet Gate?" the old Pelasgian The man who may have met Lud is an archetypal captain-figure. At the start of this section of the poem, he emerges as a Mediterranean captain listening to Elen Monica's monologue in late-medieval London. The marginal gloss identifies this captain with a Phoenician captain called "the old Pelasgian" (107) and with an "old" Greek captain called "the bacchic pelasgian" (173). 124.1 "Did he meet Lud at the Fleet Gate?" Prelude 1 124.4 "Did he walk the twenty-six wards . . .?" Prelude 2 125.15 "Was already rawish crost the Lower Pool . . ." Comp. of Time 127.3 "From the Two Sticks an' a' Apple . . ." Comp. of Place The designation, on page 124, of Preludes one and two appears to reflect the usage of St. Ignatius Loyola in The Spiritual Exercises . There the topic of meditation for a particular day is introduced by "the first prelude", recalling the history of the subject, and "the second prelude", locating the subject in a specific place. The emphases on time and place in the Ignatian preludes are combined in each of Jones's preludes, which locate this section of the poem in London and, by reference to "the White Mount" and "the twenty-six wards", implicitly designate the time as post Norman Conquest. Furthermore, the Ignatian emphasis on time and place, respectively, corresponds to the subsequent glosses designating parts of the poem as "Composition of Time" and "Composition of Place". The Ignatian terminology and emphasis on time and place suggest a parallel between the opening of "THE LADY OF THE POOL" and the commencement of meditation in the Ignatian mode. This section of the poem, after all, is an uninterrupted spoken meditation by Elen Monica, the Lady of the Pool, who is roughly Loyola's contemporary. And there may be more extensive correspondences with the Ignatian form of meditation, for the entire poem is a sort of meditation. As David Jones writes in his preface, it concerns "matters of all sorts which, by a kind of quasi-free association, are apt to stir in my mind at any time and as often as not 'in the time of the Mass'" (31). 128.9-12 | She's as she of Aulis, master: | not a puff of wind without her! | her fiat is our fortune, sir: like Helen's face 1st subj | 'twas that as launched the ship. The four lines in the text are marked with two vertical lines in the margin. The gloss cryptically indicates that the theme of this passage is the first subject of Elen Monica's long monologue and therefore one of the principal themes of the poem. In the passage, Mary is pre-typified by Iphigeneia whose sacrifice placated Artemis, against whose will the Argive fleet could not set sail for Troy (see Euripides, Iphigeneia in Aulis ). Iphigeneia's willingness to be sacrificed corresponds to Mary's fiat mihi . Furthermore, Mary resembles Helen, the expedition's formal cause, or reason for setting out. Early in the poem, Helen is called "the margaron" or pearl (56), an image recalling Matthew 13:46 and Troilus and Cressida II, ii, 81-83, both of which concern merchants setting out to acquire a 'pearl of great price'. In The Anathemata , the merchant is chiefly evocative of Christ. Mary's correspondence to Helen at the finish of the expedition suggests Mary's symbolizing the bride of Christ—bride because liturgically equated with redeemed mankind. Alluding to this correspondence later in the poem, Jones writes of Christ and Mary, "He that was her son / is now her lover" (224). In the four lines quoted above, Mary is also likened to the "pretty maid" of the nursery rhyme who tells a young man, "My face is my fortune." Because Mary symbolizes mankind, her face is our fortune—her beauty symbolizing the compliancy of will that made possible the Incarnation. Later in the poem, her magnanimity is equated with her tota pulchra , which exceeds the physical beauty of Helen with her blemished brow (194). 128.13-14 "Or may I never / keep company more . . ." Here L of P starts her long digression about lovers etc . Elen Monica has been listing the churches of London and will resume listing them on page 160. The intervening digression about her lovers will itself be interrupted by several digressions. 137.3* "His beard full of gale." Chaucer in many a tempest had his beard ben shook The poem alludes to the Shipman's portrait in the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales , line 408, which is quoted in the gloss. 137.17-19 | But the young sun / is in the fecund Ram, | Gabriel already has said Ave ! and the stark | wood lissoms. Main subj. 'Argosy' Elen Monica, alluding to Chaucer's Prologue (lines 7-8), designates the day the medieval ship Mary arrives in port as the Feast of the Annunciation, when the Virgin says fiat mihi . The Mary is here a manifestation of the archetypal ship in which every man sails. See 128.9-12 and 53.11 above. 139.6-7 "I saw water / coming from the right side . . ." a latere dextro The poem here refers to a hole in the Mary 's hull. The poet's Latin gloss is from the " Vide Aquam ", sung by the priest during Paschaltide at the sprinkling of the faithful with holy water: "I see water going out from the temple, from the right side, and all who come to that water are saved." The image of water from the temple, deriving from Ezekiel 47.1, implies that the medieval ship typifies the Church and corresponds to the physical body of Christ, from which water came after he was pierced with the spear. 140.5-6 "vancurrers of snow / and thunder noons of yallery night" 31.1.53 The word "yallery" is from the song "The Six Dukes". The word "vancurrers" evokes the "vaunt-couriers" of King Lear III,ii,5. The numbers in the gloss seem to indicate the date 31 January 1953, possibly a day on which David Jones was reading and glossing the poem. 141, bottom margin. The Captain himself speaks only on p 141, when, in reply to her direct query: 'storm or hurricane?' he answers: 'For certain this barke was Tempest-tost?" (DJ letter to DC written round about March 12th 1953) Why David Jones puts his gloss in the form of a question is not clear. In a letter of 12 March 1953 to Desmond Chute, he conveys this information without reservation. 146.10 "how this Maudlin 1 gilt 2 streamers 3 . . ." 1 adj 2 noun 3 verb 148.5 ". . . we know our rutters." from routiers "Rutters" is not a Cockney pronunciation of routiers . The French word, meaning nautical guides or track-charts, was adopted by the earliest English writers of pilot-books, which they called 'rutters'. Rutter, in this sense, is a well-established English word, though unrecognized by the O.E.D. See David Waters, The Art of Navigation in England in Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times (1958), p. 13. 149.6,10,15 "The sawbones " "The Redriff mate" subs? "The boatswain, from Milford," [Jones's underlining] All three underlined nouns may be the subjects of their respective sentences, in which the predicate "was" is understood. They may also be prepositional objects depending on the words "Without mention of the usuals as" (lines 3-4). The ambiguity is the reason for the question mark in the gloss. 149.19 [ as tho' he ] "were dozing" [Jones's underlining] 150.1 [ as tho' he ] "Had made fast" 150.4 seque ] "Had conned their ship" The three glosses above appear, as bracketed, before the phrases in the text. The glosses indicate what should be evident without them, that the phrases in the text are to be understood as introduced by the words "As though: / he" (149.17-19). Each phrase begins a simile by which Elen Monica describes the Milford boatswain's antique comparisons. 150.16* "south-south-westing" sow-/ sow Here what seems a gloss indicating proper pronunciation is actually an emendation that has not yet been incorporated into the poem. In a list of corrigenda compiled "For Jack &amp; Maire Sweeney" in 1962, David Jones writes, "Page 150, line 16, for 'south-south-westing' read sow'-sow'-westing." 150, note 3 "A phenomenon reported by Marco Polo." Cf. Marco Polo, Ch. XXXIII, trans H. Murray, 1844 . Here again, what seems a gloss is actually a correction not yet incorporated in the text. David Jones makes this clear in his list of corrigenda compiled for the Sweeneys. In the poem, Elen Monica expresses disbelief ("what a carry on!") in the Welsh boatswain's claim of "recent instances of islands that be males and females". What she reacts against is not, however, the Welsh boatswain's report (or that of Marco Polo), but her own confusion of the Welshman's story. Marco Polo reports that off the Indian coast is an island called "Male" on which men live who, for three months each year, visit their wives on an island called "Female". See The Travels of Marco Polo , Hugh Murray, tr. (1844), Part III, ch. xxxiii, p. 279. 151.3 "the modrern rig" [Jones's underlining] stet /, tho' modren is the commoner corruption . The word "modern" is pronounced by Cockneys sometimes as spelled in the text and more commonly, as spelled in the gloss. 154.12 "'now-opserve-you-close-nows-cabden'" Welsh for Captain Ellen Monica is mimicking the accent of a Welsh boatswain. 154* Of Noble Race was Shenkin This phrase, written along the outer margin, is the first verse of an eighteenth-century comical song concerning typical Welsh claims to the noble ancestory. David Jones seems reminded of the song by the Welsh boatswain's claiming Trojan and Roman antecedents. The lyrics of the song appear in Thomas D'Urfey's Wit and Mirth: Pills to Purge Melancholy II (London, 1717), p. 172. 155.10 "Gup Scot!" cf Skelton Elen Monica's exclamation derives from the words "Gup, Syr Scot", which appear in line 109 of Skelton's poem, "Agaynst the prowde scottes clatterynge, / that neuer wyll leaue theyr tratlyng." Elen Monica is accusing the Scotsman aboard the Mary of speaking excessively about "grammarie" or magic. "Gup", an exclamation usually directed to horses, here roughly means 'get out'. 156.14-16 | That was hers | that laboured with him that laboured long for us at the winepress. | anamnesis The poem refers to Mary's co-redemptive presence at the Passion of her son. The word "anamnesis", Greek for 're-calling', can mean 'a remembering' but is used liturgically to express the eucharist's 'making present again' the person of Christ and the effects of his Passion. The gloss is therefore appropriate here, where the text, employing imagery from Isaiah 63, refers to the crucifixion. But the word, here and below (164.8-12), seems primarily to designate the aesthetic effect of a special kind of remembering. James Joyce's use of the term 'epiphany' involves a similar transposition from liturgical to literary modes. David Jones probably derives his understanding of "anamnesis" from Gregory Dix, The Shape of the Liturgy (1947), pp. 242-247. Jones owned three copies of the book at the time of his death; one of them, obtained on 3 August 1948, is heavily annotated. 160.21 "At the Fisher with the ring, 'pon Cornhill" Comp of Place 164.8-9 "best let sleepers lie / and these slumberers" anamnesis Elen Monica is recalling, and praying for, legendary Brute and his fellow voyagers from Troy who sleep in the ground of London, which was thought to have been first established as 'Troy Novaunt'. 165.15 ". . . we carry out Chloris as dead as a nail." cf p 190 [= Flora Elen Monica is referring to the folk custom, originally a fertility ritual, of carrying out the spirit of vegetation, dead at summer's end but destined to be reborn in the spring. Her emphasis here on Chloris's death is appropriate to Elen's speaking during the last days of summer at the end of the Middle Ages. The poet's gloss refers to a later point in the poem where Chloris is called on to witness the symbolic blossoming of the cross in a springtime that is at once seasonal, cultural and metaphysical. This blossoming, while prefigured by fertility ritual, is of a significance not fully comprehended by pagan rites. The voice of the poem asks, | Aunt Chloris! | d' sawn-off timbers blossom | this year? | You should know. | Can mortised stakes bud? | Flora! surely you know?? (190) The gloss on page 165 makes it clear that Chloris and Flora are alternate names for the same nature-deity, associated in this passage with proverbial Aunt Flora. 166.1 "'T will soon be on us, cap'n" Episode w-wind It is the winter wind that "will soon be on us". Elen Monica's original intention in speaking to the Mediterranean captain is to warn him of the imminence of winter (see page 125). Here she concludes her digressions and resumes her original purpose. The warning she gives (lines 1-10) is called an "Episode", possibly with reference to the action framing choric expression in Greek drama, for the action of warning is the dramatic context of her monologue. Furthermore, the root meaning of the word 'episode' is 'a coming-in' ( epieisodion ). This may suggest the return to her original purpose which brings to an end the many and long excursions that are her monologue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. KEEL, RAM, STAUROS 169, the section's title page. The Ancient Mariner is behind a number of forms used in this section &amp; elsewhere in ANA . The Ancient Mariner is one of the clues to ANA ? DJ to DC 3.iii.53 . The substance of this very important gloss David Jones took from a letter he had just written to Desmond Chute. The poem's Part VI, which he glosses here, largely concerns a cosmic ship crewed by "the true-hearted men so beautiful" (175), who recall Coleridge's "the many men so beautiful" ("The Rime of the Ancient Mariner", line 236). The bride in "The Ancient Mariner" is also aboard, where girls are "red, and as / roses-on-a-stalk" (179). Of her Coleridge writes, "red as a rose is she" (line 34). The other ships in The Anathemata , which partake of this world-ship, are all in some way or other the ship of the Mariner. The Phoenician ship of Part II, for example, arrives at Cornwall after "a weary time a weary time" (98), words describing the ordeal of the Mariner's vessel (Coleridge, line 145). And like that vessel, the medieval Mary endures "vengeance of white great birds", and "wraith-barques" (142). 170.1 "Did he hear them . . .?" the old padrone In this gloss David Jones identifies the man in the text as the Greek captain called, later in the poem, "the old padrone" (182). The captain's being old typologically equates him with the Ancient Mariner. All the poem's sailors partake of the Mariner-figure's symbolic age, including the "ancient man" to whom Elen Monica delivers her monologue (166, cf. Coleridge, line 39) and the Welsh boatswain about whose "antique" comparisons Elen says "you could not choose but hear" (154, cf. Coleridge, line 18). 171.16 "He's some rare chinas" rhyming Cockney slang for mate : china (-plate) . 'China plate' rhymes with 'mate': the rhyming word 'plate' drops out and the word 'china' is used by itself to indicate 'mate'. See In Parenthesis , page 36: "Sorry mate—you all right china?" 172.11 "the're all in the swim" for they're 172.28-30 | Caulk it, m'anarchs The crew grumbling &amp; re-bellious | he's fixed you are warned not to | with his ichthyoid eye. grumble in front of the captain . 173.5 "if not the cod's-eye man?" Cf USA folksong: 'she wants the cod's eye man! The poem alludes to the sea-shanty more correctly known as "The Hog's-Eye Man," in which the hog's eye is a euphemism for the vulva. This song, bowdlerized for the ingenuous reader, appears in Shanties for the Seven Seas , Stan Hugill, ed. (1961), p. 269. 173.13 "Down" Keel From here to the bottom of page 175, the Keel is contemplated as the structural foundation of the world-ship and a symbol, therefore, of the divine Logos sustaining the world and of Christ, the Logos incarnate, who redeemed it. 174.24 "or stanchioned and 'tween decks" as p 176 The stanchioned or upright wood is that of masts. In this gloss David Jones identifies it with the mast which is a "gibbet" for men condemned to death; this gibbet is the only vertical wood mentioned on page 176. 175.25 "To be set up" Ram From here to the middle of page 178, the principal subject is a number of siege engines being transported aboard the ship. 178.11 "or vertical'd?" Stauros From here to 180.20, upright cult-objects—typologically synonymous with the Christian cross, the stauros in Greek—are considered in their ritual significance and as objects of veneration. 179.5-10 | Do these fastidious The f. are the gd ladies | exorbitantly perfected who along with the | red, and as Dowdy kiss the crucifix | roses-on-a-stalk | reach to salute you | along with the shapeless and dowdy pious 179.14 "the swaithed incurable that crept unseen" and lepers too 179.31-33 | Demos something for nothing | with crisis in his unnumbered eyes 'the mob only throngs | importunes counter-wonders? churches | &amp; temples when things | look really bad .' 180.5-8 | Phryne courtezans who tell their beads | regularly? some regularly, some on &amp; off | Lais hence | for a quick decade? d = (of rosary) The names in the text are those of Phryne of fourth-century B.C. Athens, and Lais, one of two Corinthian courtezans of that name—one in the fourth century B.C., the other in the fifth century B.C. Their names serve for any women of loose sexual morals who, nevertheless, worship with real devotion in "churches &amp; temples". 180.21 "Recumbent for us" Coda From here to 181.2, the significance of the Keel and its relationship to the cross-signifying masts are recapitulated. The glosses—"Keel" (173.13), "Ram" (175.25), "Stauros" (178.11) and "Coda"—are written large and in pencil, apparently on a single occasion and to designate the structural components of the central meditative interlude that interrupts the consideration of the Greek captain which opens and closes this section of the poem. 181.3 " Ship's master: " [Jones's underlining] = sodden, tough but efficient &amp; at base kindly skipper who berths em to schedule &amp; is thus a type of St Peter &amp; of O. Lord &amp; of Manawydan the sea-god? cf 'who do you think is master of her? Shanty p 182 . The ship's master is first of all the Greek captain whose vessel is entering its berth in Athens' Phaleron harbour (see 53.11 above). He corresponds typologically to Manawydan, Welsh sea-god and latter-day folk hero who appears later in the poem in what seems a Welsh-Norse version of the parable of the pearl (199-201, cf. Matthew 13). Manawydan, in The Mabinogion 's "Manawyddan mac Llyr", is a redeemer-figure. The question "Who d'you think is Master of her?" is asked on page 53 of the poem, where the ship is the Supper room and Christ its master. The question originally appears in the sea-shanty "Shallow Brown", which is echoed again on page 182. Here as elsewhere in the marginalia, David Jones writes his gloss in the form of a question. This is not necessarily an expression of uncertainty, for often where he uses the question mark in a gloss he is more assertive in a corresponding letter (see 141 and 169 above). In any case, he seems to be glossing as a reader of his poem, not as its author, his tentativeness possibly being in deference to the free speculation of subsequent interpreters of The Anathemata . 182.3 "the vine-juice skipper." cf sea-shanty: 'the Lime-juice skipper' The gloss quotes words from "Shallow Brown" that are altered in the poem because the Greek captain is perpetually drunk on wine. In this he recalls Christ's prototype, Noah, who "drank . . . wine" and "was . . . drunken" (Genesis 9:21 ff), and conforms to the type of Christ himself, the "winebibber" who scandalized the Pharisees (Matthew 11:19). 182.15-16* "He would berth us / to schedule" pro. sked-ule The word is meant to be pronounced as spelled in the gloss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. MABINOG'S LITURGY 184, note 8 This footnote is expanded to read ". . . at the time of his Passion in A.U.C. 783, A.D. 30", and in the margin below David Jones writes the gloss: Crucifixion April 7, 783 . The gloss gives the date as 783 A.U.C., according to the Roman designation of years Ab Urbe Condita , 'from the foundation of the city'. 190.17 "Aunt Chloris!" stet cf p 165 q.v. 208-209 Between these pages David Jones placed a loose piece of paper on which he writes the following: the schedule to which he would berth her is none other than our predestination . The liturgy. cycle comes full circle: from the cosmic Advent to the Xmas &amp; Paschal nts . w. Gwenhwyvarr we assist at . In the last—we are back . The first two lines of this note refer to 182.15-16 above. According to the theology of David Jones's Catholic faith, the term "predestination" indicates the final destiny of man, which is eternal happiness with God, a destiny intended by God but entailing man's free consent and cooperation. The final six lines of Jones's note are extremely important; they suggest a correspondence between the overall shape of The Anathemata and the pattern of the liturgical year. The latter begins with the season of Advent. So does the poem. Its first section, "RITE AND FORE-TIME", concerns the "cosmic Advent" when oreogenesis and glaciation pre-enacted the Baptist's Advent-prophecy that "the mountains and hills shall be made low" (see 53.20 above). Later in fore-time, but still in Advent, "Tryannosourus" is said to "lie down with herbivores" (74), like the lion and lamb of Isaiah's messianic prophecy. Furthermore, as the liturgical season of Advent has its conclusion at the feast of the Incarnation, the prehistoric Advent, with all its biological mutations (74-75), has its culmination in the Incarnation—which is at once the climax and complement of human evolution. Therefore Christmas, the temporal occasion and principal subject of Part VII, "MABINOG'S LITURGY", is a hearkening back to, and a completion of, some of the major themes of the poem's Part I. But Jones unites "Xmas &amp; Paschal nts" in his hand-written note. And "RITE AND FORE-TIME", if it anticipates Christmas Night (actually Christmas Eve) in the poem's penultimate section, also anticipates the institution of the eucharist on the paschal night of the poem's final section, "SHER THURSDAYE AND VENUS DAY". This section, like "MABINOG'S LITURGY", complements Part I by fulfilling certain of its themes. The sacrament of Bread is the ultimate culmination of fore-time's geological processes that make the land arable for the cultivation of grain (69, 82). The eucharist is likewise the highest expression of the tradition of ritual art exemplified throughout Part I in the sculpted mother goddess of Willendorf (59), the cave-paintings of Lascaux (60), Neanderthal burial rites (61), and ritual dance for the success of the hunt (82). The reference to "Gwenhewyvarr" in Jones's hand-written note suggests that, while the two concluding sections of the poem supplement one another in completing the themes of fore-time, this double completion has its special epiphany in the coincidence of the Incarnation and the eucharist at the Christmas midnight Mass in "MABINOG'S LITURGY". Gwenhwyfar, present at the Mass, is especially evocative of the poem's opening section; she is the symbolic equivalent of Mother Earth—the heroine, as it were, of "RITE AND FORE-TIME", clothed there in geological strata and "life-layers" (74). Like the earth, the Celtic queen wears rock strata: her "spun Iberian asbestos" (196) or "fire stone" (202), verbally redolent of the earth's "fire-wrought cold rock" (74); and her "Dalmatian tunic of gold stuff", which is "mantling" (202) reminiscent of the earth's "mantle-rock" (82). Her clothing, furthermore, represents a wide variety of the types of life on earth. Over her skin she wears Eblana flax. On her feet buck-skin of cattle, ivory of narwhal. Her lacerna or chasuble is edged and lined with fur "of marten and pale kinds of wild-cat", and embroidered with forms "as apis -like as may be" (203). To complement these bee-forms, her laticlaves are coloured with dye from real kermes insects. The queen's barley-pale hair (196-7), moreover, recalls the barley at the conclusion of "RITE AND FORE-TIME" that crowns the processes formative of the earth (82). Barley-hair identifies her, furthermore, with Demeter, the blond earth-goddess whose particular symbol is barley and whose name, deriving from the Cretan deai , or 'barley', means 'Barley-Mother'. At the conclusion of her description, Gwenhwfar, representing the earth, bows "toward the stone" holding the munera or gifts of the earth, which include bread "of Ceres", the Latin name for Demeter. As earth-figure and personally from "the reserve- granaria " (203), Gwenhwyfar herself has provided the bread. In her bow to the altar, therefore, the primordial earth gives human assent, acknowledging its purpose and fulfillment. "Cycle comes full circle," as David Jones says in his holograph note. "In the last—we are back." The marginal glosses written by David Jones in his copies of The Anathemata vary in kind and importance. Some of them identify allusions (137.3; 139.7; 155.10) and record personal associations (115, n.2). In a few instances, the marginalia clarify narrative context in a manner reminiscent of Coleridge's glosses to "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (172.28-30; 179-180). Sometimes the syntax of the poem is clarified (146.10; 149-150). But only once, when the captain's response to Elen Monica is identified (141) does serious textual ambiguity seem to require such clarification. One gloss illuminates Jones's prosody, suggesting that he, like Ezra Pound, carefully considered syllabic quantity as well as rhythmic stress (103.11). Many of the glosses, taken together, suggest a great deal about the poem's symbolism: the scope of the voyage, the permanence throughout time of the captain-figure, his identification with the Ancient Mariner and with Christ, and the correlative importance of the figure of Mary. Some of this has been disclosed or suggested by René Hague, Jeremy Hooker and other critics. No critic, however, has discovered the structural principles revealed in David Jones's marginalia: his use of what he calls prelude, pivot, coda, episode, anamnesis and composition of place and time. Furthermore, the glosses reveal the structural divisions of "KEEL, RAM, STAUROS", and suggest the symbolic and thematic resonance between the opening section of the poem and its two concluding sections. This last revelation, especially, has profound implications for the poem's interpretation and may ultimately increase its critical acceptance as one of the finest achievements of modern English poetry. 6 In any case, the disclosure justifies the claim for unity of form that David Jones makes—with characteristic deference to the reader—when he writes in the preface to The Anathemata , "If it has a shape it is chiefly that it returns to its beginning" (33).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In this context, René Hague's A Commentary on The Anathemata (1977) deserves mention. This work, based largely on personal letters from David Jones, is an indispensable reference work for readers of the poem. The most helpful and suggestive short introduction to the poem is, in my opinion, Jeremy Hooker's David Jones, An Exploratory Study (1975), pp. 32-52. 2 All page references to the poem that appear in parentheses are to this edition. I am grateful to the Trustees of the Estate of David Jones for permission to publish his marginalia, and to David Jenkins and Huw Ceiriog Jones of the National Library for their kind assistance. For help in interpreting certain glosses, I owe special thanks to René Hague and William Blissett. 3 Many were, but not all. The glosses in both copies of the poem are entered in pencil and various coloured inks, which suggests they were made on various occasions. In both copies, the presence of corrections not incorporated in the revised edition of 1955 suggests that David Jones continued to gloss his poem after that date. 4 In the first section of the poem, Jones scrawled the word "Dylan" in the margin whenever he recognized the voice of Dylan Thomas. David Jones had met Dylan Thomas several times, and had once spoken with him at length about medieval Welsh poetry, Jones doing most of the talking. 5 See Doublas Cleverdon, "David Jones and Broadcasting," Poetry Wales 8 (Winter 1972), 78-79. 6 For a fuller discussion of the cyclic structure of the poem, see my essay, "The Anagogical Shape of The Anathemata," Mosaic XII (January 1979).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Faulkner's "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune": The Evolution of a Poem by Robert W. Hamblin and Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Faulkner's first known published work is "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," a poem which initially appeared in The New Republic on August 6, 1919. Shortly thereafter, on October 29, a somewhat different text of this poem was printed in The Mississippian , the campus newspaper at the University of Mississippi. In January, 1920, Faulkner included yet another version of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" in a hand-lettered booklet of poems which he presented to his friend, Phil Stone. 1 These three versions, together with the extant manuscript drafts of the poem, provide a revealing insight into Faulkner's method of composition at this early stage of his literary career. An examination of these various copies also unveils some hitherto uncited difficulties in the establishment of a definitive text of this frequently-discussed Faulkner work. What apparently is the earliest known draft of the material which became "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" appears on a 7 by 11-inch fragment torn from the front cover of a copy of The Saturday Evening Post for August 31, 1918. 2 Consisting of fifteen lines written by Faulkner in pencil, this draft reads as follows: Ah, I peep through the trees Their flying hair whipping my face To watch their flashing knees Like light on water in some place Of sleeping streams, or autumn leaves Shed softly through long wearied autumn air Until they pause, then as one who grieves Shakes down her blown and sudden hair To veil her face—but not her eyes. They feel like sudden sparks that strike Like kisses on my face and neck. A pause, whirls through the trees That grasp like glidding [ sic ] arms, and fleck Her with quick shadows and the breeze Fans back her laughter. Years after writing these lines Faulkner would speak of how his fictional creations tended to begin with a single "image" or "mental picture" which he would then expand into the finished work. 3 He might well have made the same observation about "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune." The lines quoted above represent a miniature version of the poem subsequently entitled "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune." All of the basic components of the completed poem are present in this early draft, though they are indistinguishably blurred by Faulkner's ambiguous handling of pronouns and antecedents. The first line suggests the speaker's observer role which will define the faun-nymph relationship in the finished work. Line 2 introduces the personification of the trees, the element which (if one applies strictly grammatical pronoun reference) appears to be the controlling device throughout this particular draft and which, though reduced considerably, remains a significant feature in the published poem. On first perusal the third line seems to continue the personification, but closer inspection (and a study of later drafts) leads one to associate "their" in this line, as well as "they" in line 7, with certain personages ("dancers" in subsequent versions) being observed by the speaker. In line 8 the number shifts from "they" to "her," the one particular figure who becomes the focus of the narrator's interest. Thus, one notes, all of the essential elements—the sylvan setting, the narrator-observer, and the female figures—appear in these fifteen lines, though the treatment of each of these features would be clarified and greatly expanded in the forty-line poem. Faulkner's handling of pronouns in this draft invites all manner of speculation. Some readers, of course, would see in these lines merely one more example of the cavalier attitude toward grammatical rules which Faulkner exhibited throughout his career. Others might defend Faulkner's ambiguity as an ambitious (though seemingly ill-advised) attempt to fuse the personification of the trees with the description of the female figures. As noted previously, "their" in line 3 may refer to trees or actual personages. Similarly, "they" in line 7 may be linked with these same personages or with the falling "autumn leaves." Depending upon whether the reader views lines 7-9 as a simile relating to "leaves," the pronoun "her" in these lines may refer to either a real or hypothetical person. If Faulkner conceived of the females in this draft as nymphs, it would not be altogether inappropriate to fuse their description with that of the trees. Much more likely, however, the confusion of reference here (like the repetition of the words "autumn," "sudden," and "pause") is simply the result of multiple images flooding into the poet's consciousness in the white heat of creativity. Perhaps Faulkner (the existence of the lines on a magazine cover tends to suggest as much) was concerned only to get down on paper the essence of his poetic vision before he lost it, knowing he would return to this scribbled draft to complete the poem later on. Whatever the case, Faulkner recognized that his pronoun usage in this early draft was too confusing to be effective, and he remedied the problem when he revised the poem. In reworking his early draft, Faulkner made some two dozen changes in wording and punctuation, inserted five and one-half additional lines, and coupled this revision with a second stanza, consisting of twelve lines, which links the narrator's observation of the nymphs to a developing awareness of the tragic limitations of the human condition. Faulkner then typed out his new draft on the verso of a leaf of letterhead stationery from the First National Bank of Oxford, this time assigning the poem the title (after Stéphane Mallarmé and Claude Debussy), "L'APRES-MIDI D'UN FAUNE." 4 The text of this typescript version appears as follows: I peep through the slender trees, Her flying hair whipping my face, To watch her langourous [ sic ] knees Like flashing water from some place Of sleeping streams, or autumn leaves Slow shed through still love-wearied air. She pauses: then as one who grieves, Shakes down her blown and vagrant hair To veil her face, but not her eyes! Like hot and sudden sparks they strike - Or like the wild brown bee that flies On honeyed wings- and linger like Sharp kisses on my limbs and neck. She whirls, and flashes through the trees, That sway and bend like arms, and fleck Her with quick shadows, and the breeze Blows back her laughing. Ere she sleep, The dusk will take her by some stream In silent meadows, dim and deep- A night of stars and dreaming dream. Ah, the dancers whirling past, And the worn moon peeping through The sighing trees, until at last, Their hair is powdered bright with dew. And their sad slow limbs and brows Are petals drifting from the trees, Shed through the fingers of the boughs; Till suddenly, through all of these, A sound, like some great deep bell stroke And still the[y] dance on, lorn and cold - It was the earth's great heart that broke, For springs before the world grew old. Apart from its expanded content and form, the most significant feature of this typed draft is the clarification of the dramatic situation. This version clearly indicates that the center of the poem is the speaker's observation of the nymph. To achieve this focus, Faulkner has virtually eliminated the element of personification from the first stanza (retaining the device only in line 15), 5 and he has separated the descriptions of the single nymph and the dancers by moving the latter to the newly-created second stanza. This shift explains the changing of "their" to "her" in line 3 and "they" to "she" in line 7. Faulkner also made other changes in his previous lines. He inserted the adjective "slender" in line 1. He substituted "languorous" for "flashing" in line 3 but retained the canceled term as a description of "water" in line 4. He rewrote line 6, opening with a spondee, adding the mention of "love," and eliminating the redundancy of "autumn" from the previous line. Perhaps to avoid another repetition of phrase, Faulkner substituted "vagrant" for "sudden" in line 8. He inverted the order of line 10 and added the adjective "hot." In a revision which anticipates his use of accretional detail in his prose style, he added a second simile ("Or like the wild brown bee that flies / On honeyed wings") to heighten and extend the reference to the nymph's gaze upon the beholder. He substituted "limbs" for "face" and inserted "sharp" in line 13 and added "flashes" in line 14. He eliminated one alliteration by substituting "That sway and bend like arms" for "That grasp like gliding arms" in line 15 but created another by changing "Fans back" to "Blows back" in line 17. In all such changes Faulkner exhibits a conscious and meticulous effort to sharpen the imagery and improve the syntax of his opening lines. This typescript draft of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" demonstrates that Faulkner had clarified in his own mind the dramatic situation of the poem and had settled on a two-stanza organization; however, the poem was still far from finished. At the bottom of the typescript, in pencil, Faulkner again set to work altering his text. In what appears to be an attempt to restate in more erotic language the last three lines of the first stanza, Faulkner wrote: And she goes 6 With the dusk's mouth on her breast And his fingers in her hair Lays subtle kisses on her breast. Faulkner never utilized these lines in his poem; but he kept the image of the last line, associated it with "breeze" in line 16, and composed the following lines, which he also entered in pencil at the bottom of the typescript: Lays kisses on her limbs and breast My ['heart is' del. ] limbs are cold and I will go Where night stands in the silver west Quick with pale stars, row on row Like ghostly hands . . . . [ sic ] For ere she sleep The dusk will take her by some stream In silent meadows, dim and deep— ['A night of stars' del. ] In dreams of stars and dreaming dream. These lines, of course, with some modification, became the concluding lines of the first stanza in the published poem. Sometime later Faulkner copied the text of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" in pencil on a 14 by 8½-inch sheet of Hammermill Bond paper, incorporating some of the lines he had penciled on his typescript and revising other parts of the poem. Most of the revisions involved word changes which sharpen the description and enhance the musical quality of the verse. For example, the rather prosaic opening was reworked to read: I follow her through singing trees, ['Her clouded hair and dreaming face sudden face' del .] Her streaming clouded hair and face ['Her' del .] And lascivious ['sudden knees' del .] dreaming knees, One notes also in these same lines how Faulkner's substitution of "I follow" for "I peep" in line 1 alters the role of the faun from that of mere voyeur to that of wistful participant in the action. Faulkner would eventually make this attitude a dominant emphasis in the poem. Other changes, while less substantial, nevertheless suggest the careful and deliberate attention Faulkner continued to give the text even at this late stage of composition. For example, he temporarily changed lines 9 and 10 to read: ". . . but still her eyes / Those hot and sudden sparks, they strike." He substituted "as" for "like" in line 11 and "lift and sway" for "sway and bend" in line 15. He discarded his previous version of line 17, including the reference to the nymph's laughter, tried "Lies smoothly on her limbs and breast," then settled on "Lies on her limbs and circled breast." He rewrote line 18, altering it from "My limbs are cold and I will go" to "I have a sudden wish to go." The second stanza remained essentially unchanged from the typescript. In a choice which demonstrates a concern for accuracy and precision of detail, Faulkner rejected the thought of having the petals in line 30 drift "through the trees" and returned to his original phrase, "from the trees." He also substituted "as of" for "like" in line 33 and reworded line 34 to read, "Falls on the dancers, lorn and cold—". The revision of line 18 in this version is especially illustrative of Faulkner's manner of composition—and doubtless of the creative process in general. Regardless of whether he was aware of the fact initially, this particular line was one Faulkner had written previously, probably with no intent to link it to the poem of which it eventually became a part. Possibly during his tenure as a cadet in Canada, or maybe even earlier, Faulkner had written the following quatrain: I have a sudden wish to go Far from this silent midnight noon Wher[e] lonely streams whisper and flow And sigh on sands blanched by the moon 7 Now, in polishing the text of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," Faulkner recalled, perhaps unconsciously, the first line of this earlier fragment and inserted it into his poem. Years later, as a fictionist, Faulkner would frequently comment on the way a writer delves into his subconscious (variously called by Faulkner "a filing cabinet," "the lumber room," "a storehouse," and "the barrel" 8 ) to draw up images and observations needful for his immediate purpose. It seems that Faulkner's first published work offers an example of this process. And apparently Faulkner's recollection and use of this first line triggered his recall of the other lines of the quatrain. When he again revised "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," Faulkner incorporated all four of the previous lines into the middle of his poem. This subsequent version Faulkner likewise wrote out in pencil on a 14 by 8½-inch sheet of Hammermill Bond paper. In this copy he continued to experiment with wording and punctuation, in some cases returning to earlier forms he had for a time discarded—as in the wording of lines 9 ("but not her eyes—"), 37 ("like" rather than "as of"), and 38 ("and they dance on,") and the dropping of the ellipsis in line 21. The principal change, as indicated previously, involved the introduction of the four lines written sometime earlier. Having decided to use these lines, Faulkner had to determine where to place them in the nearly-finished poem. He settled on the opening of stanza two, a decision which dictated rewriting line 18, "I have a sudden wish to go," as "Now hand in hand with her I go." In adapting the quatrain to his use in "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," Faulkner made a significant alteration. In the original version the unidentified speaker longed to escape " Far from [italics added] this silent midnight noon." Now, however, the speaker—a faun in pursuit of a fleeting, ideal beauty—longs to travel " To [italics added] some far silent midnight noon." 9 Faulkner retained the key phrasing of his original wording, but he shifted the meaning from a negative to a positive connotation. Once more the reader is struck by Faulkner's concern for precise, accurate statement. There were still other changes from previous drafts. The pronoun "her" was stricken from line 1. In line 4 "flashing," which had previously been moved from line 3, was now deleted altogether in favor of "gleaming." Line 10 was improved considerably, both in terms of syntax and rhythm, to read: "A sharp quick spark, each sudden glance." In line 12 "On honeyed wings" was condensed to "Sweet winged." Several new descriptive details were added: "hot extravagance" in line 12, "short" (a most unusual adjective for "breast") in line 17, "virgin" in line 20, "senile" in line 30, and "white" in line 38. In line 34, perhaps to avoid a redundancy in the following line, the phrase "from the trees" was changed to "on the breeze." "Peeping" was altered to "staring" in line 30 and "through" (perhaps because the same word appeared in the previous line) to "on" in line 36. At this point "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" was virtually complete. Faulkner had moved—with extreme care and no little bit of second-guessing—from a fifteen-line draft (perhaps hastily written) which confusedly meshed together the sylvan setting, the image of the single female figure, and the view of the other figures, presumably the dancers, to an expanded version which separated and clarified these three points of focus and related them to the speaker-observer's romantic longing. Faulkner had then reworked the poem extensively, in the process incorporating four lines from a previous writing. He would continue to polish the poem, making minor editorial changes in punctuation and wording; but for all practical purposes this second holograph copy, which is printed below, represents the first genuine emergence of the finished work. I follow through the singing trees Her streaming clouded hair, and face, And lascivious dreaming knees, Like gleaming water from some place Of sleeping streams, or autumn leaves Slow shed through still love-wearied air. She pauses: and as one who grieves, Shakes down her blown and vagrant hair To veil her face, ['while still her eyes' del .] but not her eyes— A ['hot' del .] sharp quick spark, each sudden glance Or [ overscored ] as the wild brown bee that flies Sweet winged, a hot extravagance Of kisses on my limbs and neck, She whirls, and flashes through the trees That lift and sway like arms, and fleck Her with quick shadows, and the breeze Lies on her short and circled breast. Now hand in hand with her I go Where night stands in the silver west Of virgin stars, pale row on row Like ghostly hands, and ere she sleep The dusk will take her by some stream In silent meadows, dim and deep— ['A night' del .] In dreams of stars and dreaming dream. I have a sudden wish to go ['Far from this silen' del .] To some far silent midnight noon Wher[e] lonely streams whisper and flow And sigh on sands ['blenched by the' del .] blanched by the moon. Ah, the dancers whirling past, The senile worn moon staring through The sighing trees, until at last, Their hair is powdered bright with dew. And their sad slow limbs and brows Are petals drifting on the breeze Shed through the fingers of the boughs; Then suddenly, on all of these, A sound, like some great deep bell stroke Falls, and they dance on, white and cold— It was the earths [ sic ] great heart that broke For springs before the world grew old. Even though this autograph version of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" is essentially the completed poem, Faulkner continued to make minor alterations in his text. In fact, the version first published in The New Republic contains twenty-four variations from the above copy. Thirteen of these are changes in punctuation, which may have been made by Faulkner but some of which just as likely were introduced by the editors of the magazine. In the published poem commas have been deleted in lines 2, 3, 7, 14, 15, 36, and 37; commas have been added in lines 6, 10, and 18; and end marks have been altered in lines 13 and 28. But eleven changes in wording have also been introduced. The placement of the adjectives "sharp" and "hot" in lines 10 and 12 has been reversed; "like" has been substituted for "as" in line 11 and "dances" for "flashes" in line 14. Lines 19 and 29 have been reworded to add color images: "The green night" and "blond limbed dancers." In line 25 "sudden" has been changed to "nameless"; in line 29 "Ah" (which had been previously moved from stanza one) has been altered to "And"; and in line 35 "through" has been changed to "from." In line 38 "on" has been dropped and "white" has been replaced by "unclad." Admittedly, most of these changes in both punctuation and phrasing are minor in nature, but they demonstrate that Faulkner had continued to experiment with the poem even after it was ostensibly finished. And such experimentation would not end with the poem's appearance in The New Republic . The copy of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" which was printed in the October 29, 1919, issue of The Mississippian appears on first examination to be a corrupt text. Indeed, the note appended to the poem in the campus newspaper supports this view. The note reads: "William Faulkner of University of Mississippi. From the New Republic, Aug. 6, 1919." Moreover, the Mississippian 's substitution of "moon" for "noon" in line 26 and the awkward repetition of "broke" in line 40 seem obvious printer's errors. Still, concerning the other fourteen variations from the New Republic text, one cannot be quite sure. A possible key to the question is found in line 25. The New Republic 's wording of this line, "I have a nameless wish to go," is altered in The Mississippian to "I have a sudden wish to go." The change, barring the strangest of coincidences, is definitely not a printer's error, since, as noted previously, this last wording is exactly the form which Faulkner had used in holograph drafts of the poem. Apparently, Faulkner himself had a hand in producing the text which appears in The Mississippian . 10 And if Faulkner exchanged "nameless" and "sudden," he may very well have implemented some, or even most, of the other textual changes. Such a conclusion draws support from the fact that seven of the sixteen "corruptions" (seventeen, if one includes the capitalization of "D'un" in the title) in the newspaper version mirror Faulkner's practice in one or more existing manuscripts of the poem. 11 Perhaps Ben Wasson was not the first editor to annoy Faulkner by meddling with his manuscript. Faulkner may have used the reappearance of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" as an opportunity to restore certain features which had been eliminated by the editors of The New Republic . Or perhaps—and in view of his subsequent handling of the poem, this case seems more likely—Faulkner was still experimenting with the text and simply had not yet arrived at a "final" version. 12 Though it is not generally known, Faulkner returned to "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" at least once more after its printing in The Mississippian . Two months later, in January, 1920, Faulkner included this poem in a hand-produced thirty-six-page booklet of thirteen poems which he presented to Phil Stone. This volume was severely damaged in the fire which destroyed Stone's house in 1942; however, enough of the book has survived to enable one to identify most of the contents and in some cases to collate portions of the poems with other known versions. The copy of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" which appears on pages [21-23] of this booklet is particularly interesting, since it is unlike both the New Republic and Mississippian versions and since it may well represent Faulkner's final rendition of his text. The Stone copy is something of a hybrid text in that it incorporates features from both of the published, as well as the manuscript, versions and even adds some new variations. As in the New Republic version Faulkner placed a comma after lines 18 and 29 and used the word "nameless" in line 25. The wording of lines 26 and 40 also agrees with the New Republic text, offering further evidence that these particular lines had been inadvertently changed in the newspaper printing. From the Mississippian version Faulkner kept the word "as" in line 11 and the word "with" in line 34, the period after line 28, and the commas in lines 36 and 37. In one instance—the use of the comma after "whirls" in line 14—Faulkner went beyond both published versions to restore a manuscript feature; and for the first time in any version he placed a comma after "pauses" in line 7 and capitalized "West" in line 19. Again, such changes are minor, but they serve to demonstrate how Faulkner kept reworking his text on each return to it. They also illustrate the problem the textual critic faces in his task of identifying Faulkner's preference of text for "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune." No one can examine the various texts of Faulkner's first published work without being highly impressed with the conscious and deliberate care with which Faulkner approached the creation of his poem. Once again one is reminded of how misleading was Faulkner's frequent characterization of himself as an impulsive and even indifferent craftsman. Despite this fictitious self-portrait, however, Faulkner has come to be recognized for what he actually was: a consummate, painstaking artist totally dedicated to the discipline of his craft. Nowhere is Faulkner's commitment to a high standard of workmanship better evidenced than in the evolution of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Both this presentation booklet and the autograph manuscript on the fragment of a Saturday Evening Post cover, discussed below, are part of the William Faulkner Collection of Louis Daniel Brodsky. 2 From July 10 to December 5, 1918, Faulkner was a pilot cadet with the Canadian Royal Air Force squadron stationed in Toronto. There is some evidence to suggest that the penciled draft may have been written during this period. Joseph Blotner ( Faulkner: A Biography [1974], pp. 220, 245) has pointed out that Faulkner was writing at least some poetry while in Canada, possibly including a four-line fragment which was subsequently incorporated into the later versions of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune." The Saturday Evening Post , of course, would have been readily available to Faulkner in Canada: the printed notice on the cover of the August 31, 1918, issue lists the price as "5 c. The copy 10 c. in Canada." Moreover, the "autumn" setting of the poem fits the period Faulkner was in Canada, rather than the winter months when he was back in Oxford. Finally, the penciled draft was for a long time in the possession of Faulkner's mother, Mrs. Maud Falkner, and was stored with a group of materials which included Faulkner's RAF uniform and the trunk he used during his tenure of service. 3 See, for example, Frederick L. Gwynn and Joseph L. Blotner, eds., Faulkner in the University: Class Conferences at the University of Virginia 1957-1958 (1959), pp. 1, 26, 31-32, 74; and James B. Meriwether and Michael Millgate, eds., Lion in the Garden: Interviews with William Faulkner 1926-1962 (1968), pp. 245, 248. 4 This typescript, the two holograph versions of the nearly-finished poem, and the document which contains the quatrain beginning "I have a sudden wish to go" are all part of the William Faulkner Collections in Alderman Library, University of Virginia. All uses of these materials in this article are drawn, with permission, from electrostatic copies of the originals kindly furnished by Edmund Berkeley, Jr., Curator of Manuscripts, Alderman Library. The typescript has been previously transcribed (with the mistaken substitution of "And" for "Ah" at the beginning of the second stanza) in Joan St. C. Crane and Anne E. H. Freudenberg, comps., Man Collecting: Manuscripts and Printed Works of William Faulkner in the University of Virginia Library (1975), p. 19. The same volume also contains collations (pp. 17-18) of the two holograph copies and a description (pp. 127-128) of the leaf containing the quatrain. 5 In removing the personification from line 2, Faulkner created something of a logical absurdity. In the early draft "their flying hair" seems clearly a reference to the leaves and branches of the trees. In the revision the actual positioning of the faun in relation to the trees and the nymph (lines 1-3) appears contradictory. 6 The placement of these words on the page makes it difficult to distinguish whether they are a part of the lines which follow or a separate fragment of a line which Faulkner started and then abandoned. 7 Appearing on the same page as this quatrain are three experimental versions of six lines of verse beginning "This girl, she is dead, is dead." On the verso of the leaf is a draft of a poem about a flyer. Faulkner's handwriting in the quatrain is extremely difficult to read. Blotner ( Faulkner , p. 245) transcribes the lines as follows: "I have a sudden wish to go / Far from this silent midnight now / Where lovely streams whisper and flow / And sigh as sands touched by the moon." Misses Crane and Freudenberg ( Man Collecting , p. 128) render the same lines: "I have a sudden wish to go / Far from this [ two words illegible ] room / Where lonely streams whisper and flow / And sigh on sands blanched by the morn." 8 See Faulkner in the University , pp. 116, 117, 258; and Blotner, Faulkner , p. 1457. 9 This change may have been an afterthought. In his holograph copy Faulkner first started to reproduce his original line, writing "Far from this silen". Then he broke off before completing the last word, deleted the line, and wrote the new line below the cancellation. 10 Carvel Collins has made the same point and has demonstrated a similar problem with the text of another early Faulkner poem, "Cathay." See William Faulkner: Early Prose and Poetry (1962), pp. 6-7. 11 The seven variations which parallel Faulkner's practice in the manuscripts are the following: the omission of the comma in line 6; the addition of commas in lines 7, 36, and 37; the placement of a period after line 28; and the use of the words "as" in line 11 and "sudden" in line 25. 12 In this regard one notes a parallel to Faulkner's tendency as a prose writer to return to previous incidents and characterizations, frequently revising these in the retelling.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">His Editor's Hand: Hiram Haydn's Changes in Styron's Lie Down in Darkness by Arthur D. Casciato</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A study of the relationship between a writer and his editor can be revealing. Knowledge of the career of Maxwell Perkins, for instance, contributes significantly to our understanding of Wolfe, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway—all three of whom were Perkins' authors. The same is true (though in a less positive sense) of Faulkner and his first editor at Random House, Saxe Commins. Yet this bond between an author and his editor is at best fragile, if only because of the author's sensitive ego. Often an author minimizes his editor's contributions to his work, rationalizing that it is after all his genius that supplies the necessary grist for the editor's mill. Gerald Brace Warner, a novelist himself, has written frankly about this delicate alliance: Any writer is lucky to have a hard-headed editor whom he trusts, but even so, and even after repeated experience, most writers are reluctant to admit their faults. After the long hard work, after the intense devotion of mind and imagination, what is done must clearly be done well, and any suggestions for change simply represent the opinion of an outsider with different values and concepts. Writers take pride in being stubborn in their own defense. They assume that men of talent, like themselves, are misunderstood by all who are not writers, by editors and publishers and agents and those who have to do with the commerce of writing. Writers have delusions of their own importance. 1 William Styron seems not to suffer from such delusions. He has always acknowledged the important role that his Bobbs-Merrill editor Hiram Haydn played in the composition of Lie Down in Darkness , the novel which rushed Styron suddenly to prominence on the American literary scene in 1951. Haydn's influence on Lie Down in Darkness predates Styron's conception of the novel. In 1947, with only William Blackburn's creative writing classes at Duke University under his belt, Styron enrolled in Haydn's fiction-writing seminar at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Impressed by his new pupil's short-story efforts, Haydn challenged Styron "to cut out the nonsense and start a novel." 2 Styron immediately conceived a story about "a girl who gets in a lot of trouble." 3 When Styron had written only twenty pages, Haydn took out an option on Lie Down in Darkness for Crown Publishers, then his employers. But after about thirty more pages, Styron's writing bogged down completely. The young Virginian returned to the South and spent an unproductive year among his familiar haunts at Duke University. Haydn sensed that Styron was foundering and urged him to return to New York. Styron did so, and after a short stay in New York City he took up residence in Nyack, New York, with the family of another novelist named Sigrid de Lima. Later Styron moved to West 88th Street in Manhattan, and approximately a year and eight months after his return he finished Lie Down in Darkness . During this period he frequently visited the Haydn home, receiving the encouragement due a " de facto member of the family." 4 More importantly, Haydn interceded when the Marine Reserve board recalled Styron to active service before he had finished the concluding section of Lie Down in Darkness . As a result of Haydn's efforts, Styron received a three-month deferment and finished the novel. Meanwhile Haydn changed publishing houses; Styron and Lie Down in Darkness followed him to his new position as editor-in-chief at Bobbs-Merrill. 5 Haydn contributed more to Lie Down in Darkness than advice, support, and intercession with the military. Many of his suggested emendations and deletions were incorporated into the published version of the novel. Again Styron has indicated candidly, if not quite accurately, the presence of Haydn's hand in Lie Down in Darkness : And when finally [ Lie Down in Darkness ] was done, I remember how I found truly remarkable [Haydn's] ability then to exercise the editorial prerogative and point out where he thought things had gone a little haywire. There were never any major things at all in the book, as I recollect, that he changed; but certainly there were a myriad of little tiny points where he had this marvelous ability . . . to detect you at your weakest little moment where your phrase was not felicitous, or accurate, and you thought you could get by with what you put down . . . . He was not altering the nature of the book, or even much of the prose, but was catching me out in accuracies and grammatical errors, and an occasional badly chosen word. And I think this is beautiful when an editor can do this. It can only improve the book, without compromising the author's intent. 6 Certainly Styron is correct in stating that many of Haydn's changes involved "little tiny points." But close scrutiny of the holograph manuscript, the "working" typescript, and the "editorial" typescript of Lie Down in Darkness —all now housed at the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress—reveals that many of Haydn's emendations constitute more than mere editorial tinkering. The two typescripts, "working" and "editorial," reveal a unique compositional process. Styron remembers sending the novel to Haydn in four or five installments. Haydn, recognizing Styron's native ability and not wishing to dampen his enthusiasm, refrained from suggesting any changes during the initial composition of Lie Down in Darkness . A working typescript was prepared from the complete holograph manuscript, and Styron made changes and cuts throughout this typescript. A second typescript was then prepared from the emended one, and this clean "editorial" typescript was given to Haydn who marked his own suggested deletions and emendations on it. Finally, Styron approved each of Haydn's suggestions individually by incorporating them back into the first typescript. The end product is two typescripts which have almost identical texts. A third typescript was apparently prepared from Styron's twice revised "working" one and was sent to Bobbs-Merrill to serve as printer's copy. Though this typescript and the proofs for Lie Down in Darkness do not survive, a collation of the "working" typescript and the published novel shows that the usual changes in punctuation, spelling, and other accidental features, as well as some small revisions for style, were made before publication. Haydn made several kinds of minor emendations: deletion of italics, word changes, trifles of phrasing, and grammatical niceties. His deletion of italics throughout the editorial typescript, in fact, is rather significant. Styron himself has spoken often of having to rewrite the initial third of Lie Down in Darkness in order to rid the novel of Faulkner's influence. 7 Obviously, the use of italics to highlight a character's thoughts is pure Faulkner. Haydn's deletion of italics, then, is a good example of his helping Styron to exorcise the "Faulknerian ghosts" from Lie Down in Darkness . Haydn suggests twenty-eight of these cuts in the first third of the "editorial" typescript; and Styron incorporates each of these suggestions in the published novel. Sometimes Haydn's minor changes emphasize an effect. In the first chapter, for example, a middle-aged Helen Loftis dreams of her family's visit to her brother Eddie's farm in the Pennsylvania mountains. At the age of twenty-four she is already neurotically attached to her crippled first-born daughter Maudie. Both the editorial and working typescript versions of this section originally read: "The baby, waking from strange darkness into unfathomable light, began to cry but became quieter, after a while, in her mother's arms." 8 In the editorial typescript Haydn reduces this passage simply and more directly to "Helen crushed the child into her arms." This change more powerfully suggests the cloying and destructive nature of Helen's love, and Styron wisely adopts Haydn's emendation in the published novel. 9 At other times Haydn merely adds new phrases or sentences without deleting the novelist's original wording. One such example occurs in the second chapter where Loftis invites Pookie and Dolly Bonner to his home for late Sunday afternoon drinks. In this scene Loftis wants to indulge his own lustful but as yet unrealized itch for Dolly. His initial overture to her is a cruel ridiculing of her husband. The editorial and working typescripts originally read this way: "The hell with that," Loftis repeated to Dolly. "Somehow, somewhere, you got stuck." With what seemed infinite tenderness she gazed at him. She was discontented, she had had too much whiskey, and she was vulnerable to about any emotion, especially that of lust. "You're beautiful," Dolly whispered. "You're wonderful." Immediately following Loftis' remarks, Haydn adds: "They sat there for a few minutes in silence. Then Dolly stirred" (p. 61). By slowing down the movement of this passage for several beats and by freezing these two would-be adulterers in silence, Haydn dramatically underscores the importance of Dolly's reaction. When Dolly responds favorably, Loftis is sure of her receptiveness to an affair. Still, these are only minor alterations in the text. At other times Haydn's emendations are more clearly significant. He supplies what Styron calls "accuracies" to an intricate plot structure, sometimes pointing out certain narrative and rhetorical inconsistencies. Haydn also suggests numerous deletions and emendations in Peyton's interior monologue in an effort to temper that section's sexual explicitness. Most important among these are the cuts and changes muting the incestuous relationship between Peyton and her father. Successful books almost always display narrative consistency, but often the novelist may lose sight of his grand plan: inextricably caught in the web of his own creation, he lacks the distance and objectivity necessary for close artistic control. Many times the chore of refining and ordering a work falls to the novelist's editor. The best-known example, of course, is Maxwell Perkins' reshaping of Wolfe's Of Time and the River . In Lie Down in Darkness Haydn occasionally performs a similar function, but the shaping hand in the novel is always Styron's; Haydn merely points out small confusions in the narrative in order to assure consistency in the plot, characters, and rhetoric of the novel. Haydn's editorial ability is clearly illustrated in the letter that Loftis receives from Peyton shortly after her death. In this letter she tells him about the terrifyingly abstracted thoughts that plague her. In both the working and the editorial typescripts, the passage in its unrevised state reads: They've first started lately it seems, I've had these moments before, but never for so long—and they're absolutely terrible. The trouble is that they don't—these thoughts—seem to have any distinctness or real point of reference. It's more like some sort of black, terrible aura like the beginning of a disease, the way you feel when you're catching the flu. In the editorial typescript Haydn emends the single word "aura" to "mistiness"—but the emendation is significant. Haydn apparently remembered from his reading of the complete holograph manuscript that Peyton often complains of a sense of drowning in her interior monologue; "mistiness," with its dreary, oppressive connotation of wetness, is much more appropriate than "aura," a word which carries lighter, almost ethereal connotations. Styron defers to Haydn's judgment here and changes "aura" to "mistiness" for the published novel (p. 38). Similarly in the second chapter, Helen, furious with her husband for inviting the vulgar Bonners for drinks, rebukes him about his desire for Dolly. The editorial typescript originally read: "Don't hand me that sort of thing," she retorted. "You know exactly what I mean." She ran her hand feverishly over her brow—a theatrical gesture, he thought—raising her eyes skyward. She's neurotic , he thought with an oddly pleasant feeling of solicitude. There is really something wrong with her . Here, besides deleting the italics, Haydn changed "neurotic" to "queer." By substituting the suggestive "queer" for the exact, almost clinical "neurotic," Haydn understates Helen's problems appropriately. At this point in Lie Down in Darkness we have had only glimpses of Helen's destructive personality; we have yet to witness her total depravity at Peyton's wedding. Therefore, Haydn's word choice keeps Styron from tipping his hand too early; the reader only becomes curious about this "queerness" of Helen's. Furthermore, the use of the psychologist's term "neurotic" is inconsistent with Loftis' character. A Tidewater Virginia lawyer who thinks of himself as a Southern gentleman is more likely to ameliorate his wife's aberrant behavior by labeling it with a quaint word like "queer." Once again Styron heeds his editor's advice; "queer" appears in the published version of the book (p. 59). Another example occurs in the chronology of Lie Down in Darkness . In both the holograph manuscript and the working typescript, Styron begins the desolate journey of Llewellyn Casper's hearse and limousine on "a weekday morning in August in the nineteen forties." In the editorial typescript, however, Haydn specifies the date as "1945." Styron's editor again remembered from his reading of the manuscript that Peyton kills herself on the day of the bombing of Hiroshima—6 August 1945. No matter how one views this bit of gratuitous symbolism, the ambiguous dating of the novel at the beginning is inconsistent with its exact dating at the conclusion. Haydn recognized the disparity, and Styron changed the date to "1945" (p. 11). Haydn again supplies both narrative and rhetorical consistency in the letter from Peyton to Loftis. Although it appears early in the novel, this letter accurately represents Peyton's pre-suicide mental state. In the working-typescript version of the letter Peyton complains to Loftis about the poignant disorientation which is characteristic of her breakdown: Thinking of you helps some, thinking of home—but I don't know, nothing seems to really help for long. I feel adrift, as if I were floating out in dark space somewhere without anything to pull me back to earth again. You'd think that feeling would be nice—floating like that—but it isn't. It's terrible. In the editorial typescript Haydn emends both occurrences of "floating" to "drowning"—Peyton's most frequently repeated word later in the interior monologue which precedes her suicide at the end of the novel. In the published novel Peyton therefore writes to her father of "drowning" and a connection is established between letter and monologue. Haydn makes one other seemingly minor change that demonstrates his keen eye for consistency. Early in the same letter, Peyton tells her father about the noisy taproom that she lives above: "There's a bar downstairs (I remember you haven't seen this apartment since I moved up from the village) full of the loudest Irishmen imaginable." Haydn realizes that "Irishmen" is inconsistent. Peyton's lover Anthony Cecchino is Italian; her land-lady Mrs. Marsicano is Italian; and she meets another Italian, Mickey Pavone, in the same bar that she describes to her father. Peyton must be living in an Italian neighborhood, so Haydn changes "Irishmen" to "Italians" in the editorial typescript. 10 Haydn's most important emendations are his sexual cuts in Peyton's interior monologue. In 1951 when Lie Down in Darkness was published, America was still in many ways a repressive society, especially in the presentation of sexual matters. Haydn's changes reflect these inhibited attitudes: the editor repeatedly tones down the explicit nature of the sexual passages that fill Peyton's rambling monologue. Haydn first censors the passages in which Tony Cecchino, the milkman lover, forces Peyton to make love during her menstrual period. The editorial typescript of this passage reads: He came near me, erect, stiff and with veins on it like blue ink leaked out from a pen. Then it dropped some, looking silly and pink; the pain went away, receding in short little gasps, I wondered if I was bleeding yet. Haydn excises the accurate though explicit metophor "with veins on it like blue ink leaked out from a pen" from the typescript. And Haydn (or perhaps Bobbs-Merrill) apparently reduced the entire passage still further in proof so that the published novel only reads "He came near me. I wondered if I was bleeding yet" (p. 337). Later in the editorial typescript, after Cecchino and Peyton finish their lovemaking, she says "When Tony came out, he had blood all over his belly and I was weeping." Haydn cuts "he had blood all over his belly and" from the line. Once again this sentence appears to have been edited further in proof: "When Tony came out" is changed to "When it was over." The whole sentence, now entirely tamed, appears in the published novel as "When it was over, I was weeping" (p. 339). Finally Haydn emends the passage describing Peyton as she prepares to leave to visit her estranged husband, Harry Miller. The editorial typescript reads: I remember I was bleeding and I went into the bathroom and stuffed myself up. Quilted, absorbent, it was my last one; and I left hanging out the convenient thread. I scrubbed my face and brushed my lovely hair, for I must be pretty for Harry: like the tampax, "you are always out of things, darling . . . ." Haydn reduces "Quilted, absorbent, it was my last one; and I left hanging out the convenient thread" to "It was my last one." The entire passage appears in the published version of Lie Down in Darkness as: I remember I was bleeding and I went into the bathroom and fixed myself. It was my last one. I scrubbed my face and brushed my lovely hair, for I must be pretty for Harry: he would have scolded me for forgetting. "You are always out of things, darling . . . ." (p. 343) In proof, Haydn or Bobbs-Merrill must have substituted "fixed myself" for "stuffed myself up" and deleted "like the tampax." Several of Haydn's emendations in Peyton's tragic soliloquy concern the Hungarian abortionist who comes to her aid. Peyton's promiscuity has already been established for us through her affairs with the mystery-writer Earl Sanders and with Cecchino. Haydn apparently felt that an additional sordid interlude with an oily and lascivious abortionist would be unnecessary and unattractive. He therefore deletes from the text all mention of a sexual encounter between Peyton and her doctor. The initial allusion to the Hungarian abortionist in the editorial typescript suggested Peyton's desire for him: He was a Hungarian, and when I squirmed because the tube made me feel hot he said, "Does it teeckle? Dot's allride, only pwobing," and he probed some more and I got so hot I could hardly stand it, wanting him, powdered Hungarian face and flicking moustache and insolent thoroughbred flesh. Haydn substitutes "looking at the" for "wanting him," muting Peyton's sexual arousal. The second reference to the nameless abortionist alludes even more explicitly to some sort of sexual encounter: Out loud I said, "Protect—" but didn't finish, remembering the guilt, for the second time, which I had not even told Harry: the doctor, only probing, with his finger in me and not the instrument, at all, the chloroformed straining Hungarian flesh. Haydn changes the passage drastically, deleting "with his finger in me and not" and substituting "merciless inside twitching" for "chloroformed straining Hungarian flesh." The passage in the published novel speaks only of Peyton's guilt over the abortion and not of any sexual guilt: Out loud I said, "Protect—" but didn't finish, remembering the guilt, for the second time, which I had not told even Harry: the doctor, probing, the instrument, the merciless inside twitching. (p. 376) In her interior monologue Peyton's disorientation centers on the various men in her life—Milton Loftis, Dickie Cartwright, Harry Miller, Earl Sanders, and Anthony Cecchino. We observe her frenzied mind jumping from memory to memory of her lovers, distorting each affair into a jumble of sexual allusions. Haydn edits these passages carefully. For example, in the editorial typescript, Haydn censors the passage in which Peyton compares the sexual organs of three of her lovers: Harry's was just right, not big and gross like Tony's, and he said I could make it hard with the merest switch of my tail. Once he asked me who took my maidenhead and I said a bicycle seat named Dickie Boy. By deleting "not big and gross like Tony's, and he said I could make it hard with the merest switch of my tail," Haydn makes this passage far less explicit. Shortly thereafter, Haydn steps in again as Peyton compares her sexual relations with Tony and Harry: [Tony] had hair on his shoulders like wires; he was always taking it out to show me how big and he pressed my head down there once but I screamed. Harry and I did it because we loved each other . . . . Here Haydn cuts the line "he was always taking it out to show me how big and he pressed my head down there once but I screamed." He also edits the passage in which "Dickie Boy" Cartwright, Earl Sanders, and the strange, flightless birds appear together in Peyton's tortured mind: I wanted so for Dickie Boy to get it up but only when we were drunk and we were always drunk; but he couldn't get it up and I'd play with him until it hurt him. Then the birds would come around, I'd want it so badly I could have died, anything—Dickie Boy, anybody . . . . or when I lay down in Darien with Earl Sanders once we were standing up, in the shower stall, and then the wings and feathers all crowded through the yellow translucent curtain: so I slumped down against him in the pelting spray and I bit him where he wanted me to, and I thought oh Harry, I thought oh my flesh ! The editor's deletion of "and I bit him where he wanted me to" is simply the cutting of some 1950s sensationalism. But Haydn's excising of the first two sentences in this passage is more significant. In these lines Styron seems to indicate that Peyton's "bird" hallucinations are the result of sexual frustration, in this case caused by Dickie Cartwright's impotence. Actually, throughout the published novel, these "birds" are symbols of Peyton's futile search for love. Haydn's motives here would seem to be artistic as well as censorious. The most important of Haydn's sexual emendations concern the incestuous relationship between Peyton and her father. Their incestuous urges, though sublimated and never actualized, are implied throughout the novel—the playful fondling between father and daughter, Peyton's sugary nickname ("Bunny") for Loftis, her father's jealousy of her beaus, and his boyish excitement when Peyton returns home and his corresponding depression when she leaves. All these are tinged with feelings apart from mere paternal love. The incestuous action of the novel culminates with Loftis' sexual anxiety at Peyton's disastrous wedding, climaxed by his openly affectionate kiss that permanently shatters whatever familial ties still bind the Loftises together. But several times in the editorial typescript of Peyton's interior monologue, Styron does more than imply subconscious feelings of incest: he indicates that Peyton and Milton may have made abortive attempts at sex. The first instance occurs when Peyton describes a summer night in Lynchburg, Virginia, with "Bunny." But there were chimes in my soul, I was drowning in the summer night and I knew God was not a prayer automaton, but pitched half-way between Bunny and Albert Berger: love is a duality, one part dislike, one part soft-soap, so said Albert Berger, but oh how I have loved him: once in Lynchburg Bunny got me drunk off beer, and then we drove up into the hills and parked in the moonlight; he put his arm around me. I didn't care but the chill up my back—better than Dickie Boy—and then we both got embarrassed at the same time and didn't say anything for five minutes. This passage reveals urges that are certainly more than subconscious; Peyton and Loftis are embarrassingly aware of their mutual desire, if only for an instant. Wishing to mute a subject that would undoubtedly scandalize many 1950s readers, Haydn strikes the entire passage from the editorial typescript, substituting in its place the innocent line "But I remembered grass, and gulls" (p. 363). An even more explicit example occurs later in Peyton's interior monologue when she pleads with her husband Harry to return to her. The editorial typescript reads: Then I would say: oh my Harry, my lost sweet Harry, I have not fornicated in the darkness because I wanted to but because I was punishing myself for punishing you: yet something far past dreaming or memory, and darker than either, impels me, and you do not know, for once I awoke, half-sleeping, and you were still inside me and I ran my hand down your back and murmured, Bunny dear. Again Haydn realizes that this is far too explicit for Styron's audience. He changes "for once I awoke, half-sleeping, and you were still inside me and I ran my hand down your back and murmured, Bunny dear" to a more moderate "for once I awoke, half-sleeping, and pulled away. 'No Bunny,' I said" (p. 377). Haydn's emendation here may also have an artistic motive. Until this point the incest has been one-sided. Loftis alone subconsciously wants his daughter, but Peyton, though aware of her father's desire, never reciprocates. Haydn therefore makes this passage consistent with the rest of the novel by removing Peyton's physical longing for Loftis from the text. Haydn's sexual emendations, then, range in importance from his significant muting of the incestuous relationship between Peyton and Milton to his rather prudish substitution of "other things" for "brassiere and pants" at the conclusion of Peyton's soliloquy (p. 385). Ironically, Haydn was accused by David Laurance Chambers, president of Bobbs-Merrill, of "sexual obsession" because he championed Lie Down in Darkness (Haydn, p. 49). One might logically assume that Haydn's suggested changes were the result of censoring by Bobbs-Merrill or pressure from Chambers. Styron, however, feels otherwise: I think Haydn was merely following the accepted pattern when he wanted me not to be too explicit. I don't think Bobbs-Merrill or Chambers exerted any direct pressure on Haydn, though he may have been vaguely intimidated by the firm, since it was the most wretchedly reactionary and stuffy publishing house in the business. It was only because of Haydn's great faith in the book that those Neanderthal mid-Westerners backed down and the book was published as successfully as it was. In short, I think Haydn's suggested cuts were due less to the shadow of Bobbs-Merrill and Chambers than to his own feelings which were honest though unadventurous. 11 Whatever the case, Haydn's "unadventurous" changes did not alter the basic sexuality of the novel. Lie Down in Darkness remains a frank and sexually candid work. But future editors of the novel would do well to consider restoring many of Haydn's sexual cuts. Few of today's readers would be shocked by the explicitness of the sexual language deleted from Lie Down in Darkness . Much of Lie Down in Darkness , then, is the end product of a unique cooperation between novelist and editor. Styron himself was intimidated neither by Bobbs-Merrill nor by Haydn. In fact, many of Haydn's suggestions were rejected by the novelist, and none of them, sexual or otherwise, was incorporated into the novel without Styron's full approval ("A Bibliographer's Interview," p. 24). Instead of chastising Styron, as Bernard De Voto did Wolfe for his collaboration with Perkins on Of Time and the River , 12 we should applaud the then young novelist's good sense and maturity in relying from time to time on his editor's experience and judgment. Lie Down in Darkness is a stronger, more consistent novel because of Styron's wise acceptance of Haydn's help.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Haydn's Changes in the "Editorial" Typescript of Lie Down in Darkness This table lists a representative selection of those changes suggested by Haydn and accepted by Styron. The organization of the table is as follows: each entry begins with a page-line reference to the Bobbs-Merrill first edition of the novel. The page-line reference is followed by Haydn's emended reading from the "editorial" typescript. (This same reading appears at the given line in the Bobbs-Merrill text.) Next there appears a bracket which should be read as "emended from." Finally, Styron's original reading is given. For example: 18.9 whistle gave a loud blast] whistle made a shattering blast Line 9 of page 18 of the first edition of Lie Down in Darkness reads "whistle gave a loud blast." This line is Haydn's emendation of Styron's original reading "made a shattering blast." 18.9 whistle gave a loud blast] whistle made a shattering blast 18.3 up this was no day—] this was no day to mess up 19.1 hair.

Hutchens, "William Styron," New York Herald Tribune Book Review , 9 Sept. 1951, p. 2. 4 Hiram Haydn, Words &amp; Faces (1974), p. 279. 5 Interestingly, Styron again followed Haydn to his next publishing firm, Random House, which today remains Styron's publisher. But in 1960, Styron declined to accompany Haydn to Atheneum, the firm of which Haydn was a founder. Of Styron's defection Haydn writes, with what appears to be a bit of pique, that the novelist "was tired of having people think and say that he owed everything to me; he wanted to stand on his own feet." See Haydn, p. 281. 6 James L. W. West III, "A Bibliographer's Interview with William Styron," Costerus , N.S. 4 (1975), 23-24. 7 See, for example, E. P. H. [Eloise Perry Hazard], "The Author," Saturday Review of Literature , 34 (15 Sept. 1951), 12; and Hutchens, p. 2. 8 Quoted from the "working" typescript of Lie Down in Darkness at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress. This and subsequent quotations from the typescript are published here with Mr. Styron's kind permission. 9 Lie Down in Darkness (1951), p. 30. All future quotations from the novel are cited parenthetically. 10 Haydn's one remaining emendation to Peyton's letter is also important. At the end of the paragraph describing her fear of "floating," Haydn adds the line "then when I see the birds it seems [something crossed out]." This addition enhances the passage in two ways: first, Haydn's phrase "[something crossed out]" enables Styron to reap the full benefit of his epistolary technique. These crossed-out words are tantalizing to both Milton and the reader. Second, Haydn introduces the crucial image of the "birds" into the novel for the first time. Peyton speaks often of these wingless and hairless creatures in her interior monologue. The typescript sheet bearing Haydn's emendation is facsimiled in "A Bibliographer's Interview," p. 25. 11 William Styron to Arthur D. Casciato, 8 July 1978.
